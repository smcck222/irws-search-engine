  [Text] Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi 'Eraqi, the 
head of the Islamic Propagation Organization [IPO] returned from 
Baku, in the center of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and explained 
the cultural and religious needs of the Azerbaijani refugees who 
are housed in the camps set up by the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  According to the IPO public relations department, Hojjat 
ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi 'Eraqi was addressing the 
hail-and-farewell ceremonies that are held at the Azerbaijani 
Governorate upon the departure of former officials and the 
introduction of replacements in the IPO branch at Ardabil. He 
spoke on the needs of the refugees of Azerbaijan and stated: At 
present there are 25,000 Azerbaijani men, women, and children 
who are refugees and require humanitarian aid from Iran. 
  Referring to the establishment of the Headquarters for 
Cultural and Propagandistic Support in the camps for Azerbaijani 
refugees, he mentioned their enthusiasm in learning Farsi. The 
IPO head then recounted their needs for a Persian language 
teacher, a Koran teacher, tents, Islamic apparel, religious 
texts, and veils. He requested the Hezbollah nation, 
organizations and institutions to donate unstintingly to the 
Headquarters for Cultural and Propagandistic Support at the 
refugee camps and to assist in catering to their needs. 
  During these ceremonies, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Ahadi 
was introduced as the new IPO official in Ardabil. He expressed 
his appreciation for the services of his predecessor Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Ne'mati. 
  The IPO chief Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi 'Eraqi 
announced at the ceremonies to introduce the IPO official in 
charge of the Ardabil branch that the IPO is to set up a vast 
Islamic cultural center in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. He 
added: Some educational institutes and a dormitory to house the 
theological seminary students of Azerbaijan will be set up by 
the Islamic Republic of Iran in Baku. 
  Mohammadi 'Eraqi then referred to the Azerbaijani people's 
enthusiasm for learning Farsi and Islamic injunctions and called 
on the cultural and propagandistic organizations of the country 
to assist the Azerbaijanis in this regard.

  [Text] Following the recent session of foreign ministers of 
the six member states of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council 
[GCC], as well as Syria and Egypt, known as a six plus two 
sessions, Dr. Mahmud Mohammadi, a spokesman of Iran's Foreign 
Ministry, in a conversation with the IRNA yesterday, explained 
Iran's views on certain stands of members of the session on the 
dispute between Iran and the United Arab Emirates [UAE]. 
  The spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry, in referring to 
the 
final statement of the Damascus session, described as a 
repetition of UAE's baseless claims, what has been set forth in 
the statement. 
  At the same time he reiterated Iran's readiness to continue 
dialogue with the UAE for resolving the dispute. Indisputably 
in the opinion of political observers, the dispute between Iran 
and the UAE over the Iranian islands, due to the assertion of 
baseless claims by the UAE, has drawn attention of some Arab 
states of the Persian Gulf region and participants in the 
Damascus session. Hence before being based on realities, it is 
an issue that has been asserted in line with the regional 
developments and for the sake of holding of sessions by the Arab 
states. Obviously such a trend cannot be construed as 
indicative of the real stand of the UAE. This very point has 
again been refuted by the spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry. 
The spokesman expressed regret over the fact that the UAE's 
Government, while stressing bilateral talks to remove 
misunderstanding between the two states, has not taken any 
practical steps in this regard. 
  At any rate, as explained in the comments of Iran's Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, the officials of Iran's Islamic Republic 
system have constantly stressed the principle of good 
neighborliness and removal of differences through negotiations. 
  At present too, they, similar to the past, have announced 
their readiness for holding talks with the UAE authorities. But 
these efforts can attain the desired result only when the UAE 
officials reciprocate this good intention with a positive 
response. Hence UAE authorities, to bolster friendship, good 
neighborliness, and regional stability must show a positive 
response in practice based on realism and devoid of any impacts 
arising from passive stance adopted by such sessions as the 
Damascus meeting.

  [Text] Mohammad Javad Larijani, who has gone to Germany at 
the head of a parliamentary delegation, described the results of 
his discussions with Bonn officials as successful. Speaking in 
Bonn yesterday, he said that the objective behind the visit was 
to better express the Islamic Republic's stance on important 
world issues and to follow up on relations between the two 
countries. 
  Commenting on the topics discussed with the German 
officials, 
the vice chairman of the Majles Foreign Policy Commission 
stressed: We held detailed discussions on matters concerning 
Central Asian countries and ways for Tehran-Bonn cooperation in 
that region, as well as the Islamic Republic's policy on Middle 
Eastern problems and especially on the PLO-Israel accord. 
Larijani said that another topic discussed during his talks 
with the German officials was the issue of Salman Rushdie. He 
said: We pointed out to Bonn officials that the support by 
Western statesmen, and especially by Germany, for Rushdie is not 
only an insult to millions of Muslims in the world but is also a 
tension-creating element among the various faiths and harms 
international peace, security, and understanding.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Text] The killing of 18 Algerian Government officials, 
including the governor of Tlemcen and his bodyguards in an 
attack on their convoy carried out by the opposition, is one 
sign that the balance of power between the government and the 
opposition in Algeria is shifting. The attack on a convoy 
consisting of several cars that were heavily guarded in broad 
daylight shows that the attackers are well organized and armed 
and that their number was probably double the number of the 
government officials who were killed. 
  Political observers believe that the intensification of 
anti-state operations and the lack of popular support for the 
government, as well as the dichotomy in the Army, which is the 
only institution that supports the ruling military council, have 
questioned the Algerian Government's capability to control the 
current crisis in the country. The Muslims, the most powerful 
opposition group in Algeria, are becoming stronger each day and 
their strongholds in provinces and villages are increasing. 
  The Islamists have recently set up checkpoints in some of 
the 
areas they control. Also, they have complete control at night 
over other areas where the government's presence in the daytime 
is not very strong. The Algerian interior minister admits that 
at night the cities of Blida and Sidi Bel Abbes and the 
Djidjelli forest areas in eastern and western Algeria are 
completely under the control of the opposition. 
  The shift in the balance of power in Algeria between the 
government and the opposition--which is happening on the eve of 
the reopening of negotiations between the government and the 
political parties, with the exception of the Islamic Salvation 
Front, to determine the interim government's authority--reveals 
that the talks cannot be successful without the participation of 
the Islamists, who are the main actors in Algeria's political 
scene. The Islamists, who showed in the elections two years ago 
that they enjoy extensive popular support, are a determining 
force and ignoring them cannot end the Algerian crisis. In 
other words, omitting the Islamists from negotiations on 
determining the authority and special characteristics that the 
interim government will have means that the future situation 
will not be better than the current situation and that there 
should be no hope that the Algerian crisis will end.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bosnian Ambassador to Iran Omar </F>
Bahman by unidentified ETTELA'AT correspondent in Tehran; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [ETTELA'AT] Ambassador, could you tell us your 
opinion on the "day of solidarity with the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina"? 
  [Bahman] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. 
Declaring a day of solidarity with Bosnia-Herzegovina is a 
commendable move but a verbal expression of sympathy alone 
should not suffice. You should persuade them [not further 
identified] to adopt clear and definite decisions. Those who 
believe it is enough to pay mere lipservice should remember that 
they can become involved in similar predicaments. 
  [ETTELA'AT] How do you appraise the reaction of Islamic 
countries on Bosnia-Herzegovina? Have they met Bosnian 
expectations? 
  [Bahman] Islamic countries have not done all they should in 
the face of such atrocities. Unfortunately, when assistance was 
needed, it did not come. Now it is too late. 
  [ETTELA'AT] There have been numerous rounds of peace talks 
by 
the EC and the United Nations to end the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. What has been the outcome for Bosnia? 
  [Bahman] As I said, the Islamic countries have not met 
Bosnian expectations and some still deal with the aggressors. 
Some have thought only of keeping their governments in power 
and, since they demand assistance from abroad, these foreigners 
motivate them to act against Islamic countries. Tomorrow, they 
will meet the same fate. 
  [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the recent peace talks in Geneva 
and Brussels? Can the sides reach a compromise in these talks? 
  [Bahman] The sole objective of these conferences is to have 
Europe free itself of the problems of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
objective is to terminate the war but without bearing in mind 
the rights of the Bosnian Muslims. This conference will resolve 
nothing and misfortune and hardship will still prevail. 
  [ETTELA'AT] How do you see the current position of the 
secessionists of the Bihac uprising? 
  [Bahman] The Bihac scenario was staged by a group who were 
safeguarding the former regime's interests. They are the 
supporters of the former (Bolshevik) regime. They wish to rule 
regardless and clearly, this country's enemies are assisting 
them. [passage omitted] 
  [ETTELA'AT] How do you view relations between Iran and the 
Bosnian Muslim government and their future? 
  [Bahman] The Islamic Republic of Iran continues to extend 
assistance to the extent it can. This is why conditions for 
greater cooperation have been created. Iran is one of the 
greater countries for trade and construction and if peace is 
restored in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two sides can forge 
bilateral cooperation. 
  [ETTELA'AT] What message do you have for our readers? 
  [Bahman] There are many things that should be said but my 
message to the Iranian people is that first, solidarity among 
Muslims is important, as there can be no progress without it. 
Second, wisdom and intelligence are necessary everywhere. 
Specialists and youth should seek to acquire new technology and 
grapple with problems. The Islamic Republic of Iran has a 
competent specialized cadre. No one should content himself with 
dependence on foreign specialists or seek solutions from them.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Sudanese Ambassador to Iran </F>
Qutbi al-Mahdi by unidentified correspondent in Tehran; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, the West's 
propaganda stance against the Sudanese Government has now 
entered a more serious phase and has led to the economic boycott 
of Sudan. It is feared that this pressure will become even more 
serious and more dangerous. Do you have the same feeling? 
  [Al-Mahdi] Yes, we too have this feeling. But with our 
people's support, we are ready to face anything. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What do you mean by "anything?" Do you 
foresee a military intervention? 
  [Al-Mahdi] We now see the indirect military intervention of 
arrogance in our country. They are strengthening the rebels in 
southern Sudan with arms and money. Also, they have started 
conflicts in northern Sudan so that attention will be diverted 
from the south and so that in the propaganda atmosphere created, 
they can more easily invest in and support the rebels in the 
south. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Are you not afraid because the United 
States and its Western allies have militarily intervened in 
Somalia, your neighbor, and do you not think that Sudan's turn 
will come after Somalia? 
  [Al-Mahdi] Yes, basically, it would have been Sudan's turn 
after Somalia. But with the lesson that the Americans learned 
in Somalia, it is impossible that they will take this dangerous 
risk. They are aware of the uniformity that exists between the 
government and the nation of Sudan. They also have their 
actions in Somalia in front of their eyes. Naturally, under 
such conditions they do not consider it advisable to repeat 
their disgrace in our country. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Then do you rule out the threat of a 
military attack against Sudanese territory? 
  [Al-Mahdi] No, not completely. We only consider it 
improbable and think that they have concentrated their policy 
against us in other forms such as economic sanctions, boycotts 
of our exports, preventing economic investments in Sudan, and -- 
of course -- sending arms and money to the armed rebels in 
southern and northern Sudan. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] You are emphatically specific in 
attributing the uprisings in southern and northern Sudan to 
forces outside your borders. Do you have any proof of this? 
  [Al-Mahdi] Yes, based on the type and brand of the arms that 
we have taken from the rebels and the prolongation of their 
resistance, we are confident that they are receiving support 
from abroad. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Which government do you suspect? 
  [Al-Mahdi] I am not accusing a specific government. But the 
crisis in southern Sudan has definitely been created by British 
colonialism. Britain started to invest greatly on creating 
ethnic and religious differences in Sudan a long time ago, and 
we consider British colonialism to have been very involved in 
the commencement of the crisis in our country. This is 
historical fact. As for northern Sudan, it is not in the 
interest of any country to support the incidents and the 
uprisings there. We believe that such tensions in southern and 
northern Sudan stem from a specific policy that the United 
States and Israel are pursuing today. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, you strongly condemn 
governments that are far from your borders for the ethnic crisis 
and the domestic rebellions in your country, as if there were no 
other country along your borders that had a hand in sparking the 
fire in Sudan. 
  [Al-Mahdi] Look, we are living in a world that is being 
managed on the basis of a new order--a system that has its 
regional mentors, elements, and supporters. I only want to say 
that there are also many governments and nations that are 
resisting this order. They are not sitting idle and are 
defending the rights of the oppressed. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, the Westerners have 
accused you of opposing the military presence of the U.S. and UN 
forces in Somalia or, in other words, of supporting the people 
and the rebel groups in that country. Is this accusation 
correct? 
  [Al-Mahdi] They have to prove their accusation. They want 
to cover up their defeat in Somalia by resorting to such 
accusations. Naturally, we consider the people in Somalia to be 
right, and we also know that the foreign forces have not gone to 
Somalia to help the Somalians and that their mission has never 
been humanitarian as was publicized. Naturally, some 
governments have extended support for the popular resistance in 
that country. But this does not mean that a specific country 
can be so easily accused. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] I thank you for Your Excellency's 
remarks 
and would like to hear your comments on the relations between 
your government and the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  [Al-Mahdi] The most important aspect in the relations 
between 
Iran and Sudan that has enraged the two countries' common 
enemies is the Islamic nature of both countries. In other 
words, Islam has become a common element that has paved the way 
for a healthy and fraternal relationship between the two 
countries. This is a phenomenon that is very rare in the world. 
We have been able to transform our friendship and our positive 
relations from words into deeds. Our political stances are the 
same and both of our countries have a common view at 
international forums. We in our country have greatly benefited 
from the technology and the economic and technical strength of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are observing Iran's 
constructive activities in our country; and this is something 
that we value. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, if you have something to 
add, please do so. 
  [Al-Mahdi] I only want to make one point and that is that we 
are an independent country, nation, and government. Today we 
are actually paying for our independence. The West's pressures, 
plots, and attacks against us are happening because today we 
want to stand on our own two feet and become economically 
self-sufficient, contrary to the past. The West's fear is that 
we want to implement Islamic shariah in our country and to rid 
ourselves of the pro-Western culture that is a legacy of 
colonialism. If we are now able to stand on our feet despite 
all the foreign pressures to weaken us, it is because we enjoy 
the people's support.

  [Editorial Report] Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran First Program Network in Persian at 0905 GMT on 13 January 
broadcasts the "In Line With the People, in Step With the 
Officials" phone-in program. This week's program, which lasts 
88 minutes, features five senior officials of the Islamic 
Revolution Guards Corps [IRGC]: Brigadier General Seyyed Rahim 
Safavi, the deputy commander of the IRGC; Brigadier General 
Mohammad Baqer Zolqadr, the head of the IRGC's Joint Staff; 
Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Razini, deputy to Ayatollah 
Khamene'i's representative in the IRGC; Brigadier General 
Mohammad 'Ali Ja'fari, the commander of the IRGC's Ground 
Forces; and Brigadier General Amir 'Ali Amiri; head of the IRGC 
personnel office. 
  The participants stress the instrumental role of the IRGC in 
defending the country and the revolution during the war with 
Iraq, and as well as its important contributions to Iran's 
post-war reconstruction and development. This is followed by 
interviews with members of the public who pay tribute to the 
IRGC and its important services, and ask for more information on 
the IRGC's involvement in development projects. In reply, 
Brigadier General Safavi enumerates a number of projects, such 
as construction of dams and gas pipe- lines. 
  A relative of a martyr asks what assistance is given to the 
families of martyrs. Amiri says that part of the IRGC duties is 
to identify all IRGC martyrs, visit their families, and 
cooperate with the Martyrs Foundation to help these families. 
Zolqadr also talks about a university for sciences which is run 
by the IRGC. 
  Razini is asked about the function of the representative of 
the leader in the IRGC. He says that the IRGC came into being 
to safeguard the gains of the revolution. The task of the 
leader's representative is to make sure that the original 
revolutionary spirit is maintained. His other roles are to 
ensure the guards' ideological suitability and supervise their 
promotion, and to conduct a general supervision of the IRGC to 
ensure that all its decisions and regulations are in keeping 
with religious norms. 
  One of the guards asks if any attempts are being made to 
write a documentary history of the Iran-Iraq war. Ja'fari says 
that some cultural and artistic activities are under way to 
safeguard the memory of the gains of the war. Safavi adds that 
there is a great deal of audio recording about the events of the 
war, as well as about 100,000 pages of records about the history 
of the war. These will be useful in future for those who wish 
to write the history of the war. 
  Then there are a number of questions about promotions, 
transfers, career development opportunities, and pensions and 
benefits for IRGC personnel. Amiri provides detailed answers to 
these questions. 
  At the conclusion of the program, Zolqadr refers to the 
IRGC's contribution to the fight against terrorists attempting 
to hijack Iranian airplanes. He says: "I only wished to use 
this opportunity to mention the efforts of our dear brothers, 
the unknown guards who have the very important responsibility of 
protecting the aircraft of the country. I must say that during 
the period when on the orders of the late imam the IRGC was 
given the responsibility of protecting the aircraft of the 
country and the flights, 70 plots for aircraft hijacking were 
foiled by the dear guards and nothing went wrong during that 
period. I should just explain that the last case in which one 
of the Oil Ministry's private aircraft was hijacked to Iraq by 
the counterrevolutionaries -- that case happened by dint of the 
fact that there were no guards on board. The IRGC was not 
responsible for that flight, and the aircraft was not guarded by 
the IRGC. After that, as a result of the insistence of national 
officials, the IRGC was given the responsibility of providing 
protection for all flights. It was made responsible for their 
protection. I like to thank the brothers for this during these 
blessed days."

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Minister, Sir: One Cannot Forge a </F>
Society With Directives"] 
  [Text] A political society needs participation in 
political affairs; otherwise, political disillusionment sets in 
and gradually disenchantment with all political affairs engulfs 
the whole society. Preservation of the freshness and fervor of 
the presence of society in political affairs cannot be done by 
force. Neither can government directives be instrumental in 
politicizing a society, nor can one force the people to 
participate in political affairs at a particular juncture or for 
the sake of the personal inclinations of an individual. 
  That society has a constant presence on the political scene 
which is endowed with political acumen and this cannot be 
achieved without the spontaneous fervor of the people for such a 
presence and is only possible when the society feels such a need. 
  The great leader of the revolution constantly stresses the 
people's regular presence on the political scene and recently 
too he exhorted the students to cultivate political 
understanding and insight -- it is a source of amazement that 
the students cannot participate in the most essential gathering 
and march against the United States on the day that has been 
declared a national day of combating the powers of world 
arrogance. 
  Interior Minister Besharati's response to a question by the 
Rasht deputy gives the impression that the commemoration of this 
day and the marches by students on 4 November [anniversary of 
the takeover of the U.S. Embassy by Iranian students] can only 
be done through government channels. 
  If the students of this country, who are part of an 
enlightened, dynamic, and aware society, have to surmount a 
barricade called a government directive to express their hatred 
and to condemn the United States, how can they be expected to 
have a constant presence on the country's political scene? 
  In answer to the question by the Rasht deputy, the interior 
minister stated: "Our criterion for granting permission to 
stage marches on 4 November is the directive which is a legal 
document, and we can grant permission to only one organization 
and that is the Islamic Propagation Coordination Council." 
  Minister, Sir! Please note that on the day that it becomes 
necessary for students to be present on the political scene to 
condemn the powers of world arrogance, it will not be possible 
to drag them to that scene with a directive. 
  Yes. The law is to be respected and its implementation is 
necessary and it is binding on all. However, it is not possible 
to groom a society to be a spontaneous political one endowed 
with a high level of awareness and acumen merely by means of 
government circulars.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- Iran's membership in the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) would benefit the 
agricultural sector, says Agriculture Minister 'Isa Kalantari. 
  In an interview with the morning daily HAMSHAHRI published 
Wednesday, the minister said that Iran and other non-member 
countries would have to join GATT sooner or later. "However, we 
have to strengthen the infrastructure and structure of our 
economy in such a way to become able to enjoy the facilities 
which are to be provided by the agreement," Kalantari stressed. 
  He believed that Iran can obtain a favorable export market 
for its several agricultural products such as vegetables and 
green house products. After joining the GATT, the minister 
added, Iran has to introduce certain changes in its present 
agricultural patterns in the coming years. He noted that in 
future Iran should produce strategic products such as wheat, 
rice and sugar as much as are needed for domestic use only. 
  Should Iran be able to benefit from the facilities provided 
by GATT, it would get a good chance for exporting its 
agricultural products, he maintained. 
  Moreover, Kalantari added, with implementation of the 
agreement, the world prices for Iranian agricultural products 
would increase. 
  Iran should become self-sufficient in wheat production as 
soon as possible, because, he said, the world prices for this 
strategic product are on the rise.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 13, IRNA -- Governor of the Central 
Bank of Iran Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli said that the impending G-7 
meeting in Paris is directed against Iran. 'Adeli, quoted by 
the Thursday issue of the English daily `TEHRAN TIMES', said 
reports indicated that Washington was exerting pressures on the 
G-7 to keep Tehran in isolation. 
  The Group of Seven including the United States, Britain, 
Germany, Italy, France, and Japan is to meet in Paris on January 
16. He further elaborated that the Western media launched on a 
U.S.-orchestrated propagnda on Iran's debts to create an 
anti-Iran international public opinion. Then Washington decided 
to air this baseless issue in the G-7 meeting, he said. 
  Admitting that Iran has some financial problems due to the 
prevailing economic situation in the world, he told the daily 
that while the most industrialized countries have faced economic 
recession, others also felt its impact directly or indirectly. 
  He was quoted as saying that the drop in oil prices at the 
international market adversely affected Iranian foreign currency 
revenues, "as a result, during the years of 1991, 1992 and 1993, 
we received dlrs. [dollars] 9,500 million less than we had 
anticipated." 
  Turning to the Iranian debts, 'Adeli brushed aside western 
propaganda in this regard and said Iran has dlrs. 8,000 million 
to be paid. The payment of the amount has been delayed, said 
the CBI governor, due to the non-cooperative attitude of 
insurance agencies to cover medium and long-term credits. 
  "We were obliged to make most of our trade on cash or 
short-term credit basis making ourselves vulnerable to the oil 
price fluctuations," he told TEHRAN TIMES. 
  'Adeli said that Iran has to pay to foreign private 
companies 
and private sectors and not governments and that there were no 
problems with them regarding the repayment process. 
  "But it is the governments that are exerting pressure on 
their private sectors to force the early payments and in this 
way those governments want to take an unfair advantage under the 
present situation." 
  He stressed that most of European governments want to solve 
the debt problems but the U.S. is creating unnecessary hurdles 
on their way. 
  "The U.S. is going to put further pressure on European 
countries, as well as on Japan, in the Paris meeting on the 
so-called debts of Iran. In fact the U.S. wanted to see what 
concessions it could get from the Islamic Republic." 
  'Adeli said to TEHRAN TIMES, "we do not owe the U.S. 
anything, but that country along with Britain will continue to 
initiate a negative stance against Iran." 
  Talks are under way with Japan and Italy to solve the 
current 
problems. 
  Turning to the stand of France and Germany, he said their 
recent moves were far from Iran's expectations particularly 
regarding Bonn that had promised to solve the financial issues 
without making much noise. 
  He said that Iran imports German goods worth 8,000 million 
marks annually while 1,500 million marks worth of Iranian 
products are exported to that country each year. 
  'Adeli said dlrs. 92,000 million was planned to be spent 
during the first 5-year plan but because of the drop in oil 
prices the figure was reduced to dlrs. 80,000 million, 30 
percent of which was invested in basic projects. 
  On the achievements of the plan, he told the paper that up 
to 
1990 Iran imported two million tons of steel annually but now 
exports 700,000 tons each year. 
  He added that over the same period the country imported two 
million tons of cement annually but now has reached 
self-sufficiency and in some cases even exports cement. 
  The country's annual import of 4.5 million tons of wheat has 
dropped to 1.5 to 1.2 million tons and import of petrochemical 
products lowered from dlrs. 800 million to 600 million in 1993, 
the paper quoted him as saying. 
  Iran exports goods worth dlrs. 1,200 million annually 
including carpets, pistachios and saffron. Besides it also 
exports dlrs. 2,300 million worth of non-oil industrial goods 
each year compared to dlrs. 700 million a few years ago.

peace in the Middle East. His contribution to the struggle for 
peace will serve us as a beacon in our future effort to end all 
wars.

  [Text] The increase in acts of terror in settlements close 
to the Iraqi border again drew everyone's attention to northern 
Iraq. A group from Kanal-6 visited northern Iraq and met the 
Kurdish leaders of the problematic region. 
  We are presenting our colleague Kursat Hakyolu's impressions 
from northern Iraq with the pictures taken by cameraman Numan 
Tunc Inal. 
  [Begin recording] [Hakyolu] While the PKK [Kurdish Workers 
Party] terrorism escalated on the Turkish side of the 
Turkish-Iraqi border, the position taken by the Kurdish groups 
on the other side of the border against the PKK is somehow not 
becoming clearer. Steps taken by the northern Iraqi Kurds toward 
the formation of a state are being debated in international 
forums. In the meantime, Kurdish groups are feuding with each 
other. The clashes between the Kurdistan Islamic Front and 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan led by Jalal Talabani have just 
ended. It is also being reported that there is disagreement 
between Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani, leader of Democratic 
Party of Kurdistan, on stances to be adopted toward the PKK. 
  Our meeting with the north Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad 
Rasul Kusret took place while these important developments were 
taking place in the region. 
  Barzani had once again declared the PKK a terrorist 
organization, whereas Talabani made no statement. This was our 
first question to Prime Minister Kusret, who is from Talabani's 
PUK. 
  [Kusret in Arabic with superimposed Turkish translation by 
an 
off-screen reporter] We reject every sort of violence, no matter 
where it comes from. If violence is coming from the PKK, we 
reject that too. We condemn all sorts of violence. 
  [Kusret continues in Arabic in the background with Hakyolu 
providing a summary of his views] Rejecting reports that the PKK 
is infiltrating Turkey from Iraq, Kusret said that they are 
controlling the borders and are not allowing the PKK through. 
Nevertheless, he added that they need Turkey's support and that 
this problem could be completely solved through cooperation with 
Ankara. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji, 'Abdallah al-Hajj, and Ahmad </F>
Muwaffaq Zaydan: "Rabbani Tells AL-HAYAH: Devil's Alliance 
Between Hekmatyar and Dostam"] 
  [Excerpts] Jeddah, Peshawar -- Islamic leaders concerned 
with the Afghan issue have urged Custodian of the Two Holy 
Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz to mediate between the 
Afghan leaders "in view of his spiritual influence" over them. 
[passage omitted] 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, the Afghan president has 
welcomed the mediation of the brothers in the Islamic states. 
However, he warned that his two rivals, Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar and Uzbek militia leader Abdul Rashid 
Dostam, "have always broken the pledges and failed to abide by 
the agreements." 
  This comes while the Iranian mediation between Rabbani and 
Hekmatyar has failed to achieve its aims. The Afghan prime 
minister informed the Iranian envoy Ibrahim Zaheryan of the 
opposition alliance's refusal to stop the fighting until the 
Afghan president submits his resignation. 
  In a telephone interview conducted with him from Jeddah, 
President Rabbani told AL-HAYAH that the Hekmatyar-Dostam 
alliance is a "devil's alliance," and that "its aim is to seize 
power in Kabul over the bodies and corpses of the innocent." 
Pointing clearly to Hekmatyar and Dostam, he said that "the 
alliance between them was established secretly long ago, and 
when the time came to implement the conspiracy, they announced 
it." 
  Rabbani added that "recent events have provoked the 
indignation of the Islamic world, especially as the aggressors 
have shelled mosques, houses of worships, and hospitals inside 
Kabul." Rabbani welcomed the mediation of the brothers in the 
Islamic states but stressed that Hekmatyar and Dostam "have 
persisted in breaking pledges and not abiding by agreements."

  [Text] Reports from Afghanistan speak of continued air 
attacks on the capital, Kabul, for the consecutive third day 
today after the 36-hour temporary cease-fire broke down on 
Monday. Reports say General Rashid Dostam's jet planes made 
three sorties today and bombed the presidential palace and key 
positions of Afghan government. There are also reports of 
intense fighting in Mazar-e Sharif between the rival Afghan 
factions. 
  Since the outbreak of fighting in Kabul on 1 January, 
hundreds of civilians have been forced to flee their homes. 
More than 14,000 people have taken refuge in Pakistan. They 
reached Peshawar via Jalalabad. According to the representative 
of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], at least 
50,000 displaced people have reached Jalalabad. UNHCR has sent 
2,100 tents to Jalalabad. Food, blankets, and medicines have 
also been dispatched. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman termed the situation in 
Afghanistan as tragic and hoped that the warring factions would 
respond positively to the appeal of the president, Farooq Ahmad 
Khan Leghari, and the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, for 
cessation of hostilities from Friday morning. The spokesman 
told at a news briefing in Islamabad today that there had been a 
large number of civilian casualties in the fighting and hoped 
that the cease-fire would be accepted so that the medicines and 
relief supplies could be rushed to Afghanistan. He said so far 
over 14,000 Afghan nationals have been registered by Pakistani 
and UN officials, besides those who have arrived in Pakistan. 
The spokesman said 54 diplomatic personnel from Pakistan, 
Turkey, Libya, Sudan, United Nations, and other international 
agencies have been evacuated to Pakistan via Jalalabad. 
  The spokesman said Pakistan has convened a meeting of the 
ICO 
[Islamic Conference Organization] contact group at ministerial 
level in Geneva on Monday to review the latest developments in 
Bosnia. The meeting convened at the request of President Alija 
Izetbegovic of Bosnia will be presided over by Foreign Minister 
Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali. He said Prime Minister Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, along with the Turkish prime minister, Madam Tansu 
Ciller, will visit the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, on 2d of next 
month as a gesture of solidarity with the Bosnian people.

  [Excerpt] This morning in the ceremonies marking the end of 
the tenth round of competitions for the memorization and recital 
of the Holy Koran which were held in Imam Khomeyni Hoseyniyeh, 
the esteemed leader of the revolution His Eminence Ayatollah 
Khamene'i described the Holy Koran as the best safeguard for the 
well-being of the country and the continuation of the system of 
the Islamic Republic. He stressed the need for teaching and 
learning the Holy Koran. 
  In these ceremonies which lasted for more than two hours, 
His 
Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i described the Muslim Iranian 
nation's familiarity with and love for the Holy Koran as a great 
divine bounty. He said: Koranic studies are daily increasing 
among our nation. The Koran should penetrate the hearts more 
than ever before and should be implemented in the society. 
  Stressing the close ties existing between the Koran and the 
Imamate [etrat--Shiite term referring to imams who followed the 
Prophet] and the need for the greater reliance of Muslim nations 
on these two inseparable entities, the esteemed leader of the 
revolution said: Today the slogan of "Koran, Islam, and the 
call of God" has spread among Muslim nations. If other Islamic 
nations and governments remain together like the Iranian nation 
and government and if they rely on the Holy Koran, arrogant 
powers cannot dominate such governments. 
  Referring to the importance of the issue of Palestine, the 
esteemed leader described Palestine as a part and parcel of the 
Islamic homeland and a land which was the first qiblah 
[direction in which Muslims turn during their prayers] of the 
Muslims of the world. He said that the influence of the hands 
of arrogant powers over the Islamic governments is the main 
reason why the issue of Palestine has been forgotten. He added: 
The enemies of Islam and Muslims by exerting pressure on Islamic 
and Arab governments have taken them out of the arena of 
struggle, so much so that these governments discuss minor issues 
in their meetings, but the issue of Palestine which is among the 
most important issues of the world of Islam is forgotten.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Sha'th: Washington Seeking Progress </F>
Before Clinton-al-Asad Meeting"] 
  [Excerpt] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Taba negotiations concerning the 
implementation of the self-rule agreement, has said that the 
talks concerning security issues are "proceeding slowly and 
facing difficulties as a result of the intransigent Israeli 
position on some points." He emphasized that Israel is 
determined to complete the withdrawal on the fixed date, that 
is, 13 April. 
  He said that discussions "are still continuing to determine 
the the size of the Jericho area -- a difficult point requiring 
great efforts." 
  He announced that "the U.S. Administration is seeking to 
achieve tangible progress before before the U.S.-Syrian summit 
scheduled for Sunday [16 January]." He pointed to "Egyptian 
efforts being made to advance the negotiations, with constant 
follow-up of the negotiation process." 
  Sha'th disclosed to AL-HAYAH that the Israeli delegation 
presented several maps: one containing new areas added to the 
Jericho area, one concerning Israeli settlements, and one 
containing layouts for the crossings. He said that these maps 
"reflect an advanced position, but it does not fulfill 
Palestinian demands." 
  He said: "I believe that there is an Israeli change in terms 
of the security concept." He cited the statement issued by the 
U.S. State Department urging the Palestinian and Israeli sides 
to achieve progress. He said that it "is aimed at pushing the 
negotiations forward before the meeting between Presidents Bill 
Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva on Sunday." 
  Sha'th pointed out that the Palestinian side may seek the 
intervention of the United States or Egypt "if the situation 
continues as it stands." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Khayrallah Khayrallah article: "Syria First Beneficiary"] </F>
  [Text] The importance of the statement issued at the end of 
the meetings of the foreign ministers of the eight signatory 
states of the Damascus Declaration is that it represents a 
preliminary step to define a comprehensive Arab policy vis-a-vis 
what is happening in the region. This step comes in the absence 
of the Arab League and in the shadow of the mutual aversions the 
Middle East is witnessing at more than one level. 
  Maybe the most important point in the statement -- apart 
from 
the support it provides for President Hafiz al-Asad a few days 
before the awaited meeting between him and President Clinton -- 
is that it avoids thorny issues which can be discussed at a 
later stage, like the Arab boycott of Israel. In this 
connection it seems striking that the eight states sought to 
come out with a position that is far removed from rhetorical 
oneupmanship and as close as possible to realism. In return for 
the statement's support for Syria, Damascus had to continue its 
"neutral" position on the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
Although describing the agreement as "a first step which should 
be complemented by steps on the other tracks" is a statement 
which needs to be explained and could have more than one 
meaning, Syria's agreement to it again means that a minimum of 
understanding has been reached between it and Egypt, which is 
sparing no efforts to make the Palestinian-Israeli agreement a 
success. 
  It is clear that Syria was the first beneficiary of the 
meetings of the foreign ministers of the eight states in 
Damascus. What seems to be useful in this connection is that 
the statement issued by the eight ministers, which supports the 
United Arab Emirates' position toward Iran in their dispute over 
the three islands [Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa], 
has shown that the Damascus Declaration has not died and that 
what has actually died is a certain understanding of the 
declaration -- the understanding whereby it is made to shoulder 
more than it can bear. Once the signatories are convinced of 
this, it will be easy to hold meetings, adopt positions, and 
seek an understanding on the broad outlines of Arab policies. 
  The statement can in itself represent a serious attempt to 
determine what can and what cannot be done. With the passage of 
time it has become clear that words have become meaningful even 
in the Arab world. And that it is no longer acceptable to talk 
about the region in the manner that existed in the past. And 
that every single word means something now, especially when it 
comes to Gulf security and the role of every party in 
safeguarding it. This is because all the developments that have 
taken place since the second Gulf war, which was the result of 
the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, fall within one framework, 
namely redefining the roles in the region, taking into account 
the role played by the international coalition in defeating 
Iraq, in addition to the role of the states surrounding Iraq and 
the Arab world. If this process of redefining the roles had not 
taken place, the Madrid conference would not have been convened 
or led to what it has led to.

  [Text] The brother President leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 
'Arafat] said that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have 
reached a deadlock because of Israelis' avoiding the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement which they signed 
in Washington and their attempts to explain the agreement in a 
wrong way which only serves their aim. He warned that the 
failure of this agreement would lead to a comprehensive chaos in 
the region. 
  In an interview to the Qatari paper AL SHARQ, which it 
published on Thursday [13 January], the brother President leader 
Abu-'Ammar stressed that the Palestinians would not be the 
losers at the end because instability would affect all the 
region. 
  The brother President leader Abu-'Ammar added that while the 
Palestinians demanded a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip and the Jericho region, the Israelis wanted to carry out 
an operation of redeployment of their army which is a matter 
violating the agreement signed between the two sides. 
  The brother President leader Abu-'Ammar added that Israel 
wanted to control crossings in order to make the Palestinians 
live in isolated areas, which is a matter rejected by the 
Palestinian side in the negotiations. 
  The brother president leader criticized the Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and said that he was not interested in 
anything anymore now that he has received the U.S. reward for 
signing the Washington agreement including weapons, a giant 
computer which can only be found in super-powers in addition to 
240 million dollars to spend on redeployment of Israeli forces 
in addition to other U.S. loan guarantees.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi: "Sulayman al-Najjab </F>
Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Israel Is Planning To Bring Autonomy 
Rule Under Its Control and To Isolate Jerusalem Permanently From 
the Palestinian State"] 
  [Excerpts] Tunis -- A PLO official has emphasized that 
Israel's current intransigence and backtracking intensify the 
negotiation impasse and more clearly expose the Israeli 
Government's intention of using the negotiations as a cover for 
annexation and expropriation of land not carried out before the 
peace negotiations. The evidence, he said, can be found in 
Israel's continuing implementation of measures isolating 
Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied territories and its 
rejection of any demands for the reversal of these measures. 
  The Israelis, he said, are still using the Palestinian 
detainees and deportees as hostages to blackmail the Palestinian 
side. The official, PLO Executive Committee Member Sulayman 
al-Najjab, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, said that, 
during the recent negotiations, the Israelis hinted that they 
were willing to release a new batch of detainees if the 
Palestinians accepted the recent Israeli proposals on 
supervision and control of the crossing points and bridges. 
  On the results of the latest round of negotiations held by 
the liaison mission recently in Cairo, al-Najjab said: "That 
round did not achieve any tangible progress because the Israeli 
side retreated from its previous positions adopted in Paris and 
Tunis." [passage omitted] 
  The Israeli Government, al-Najjab said, is now acting 
without 
regard or consideration for the Declaration of Principles and 
behaving as if that agreement did not exist. 
  Al-Najjab stressed that the security issue, which the 
Israeli 
side uses as a pretext, insisting on the article in the 
agreement which gives it responsibility for external security, 
does not concern Israel alone, because it is a matter of mutual 
concern. 
  He said that the Israeli side overlooks a fact which is 
linked to and not less important than the security issue, namely 
the stipulations in the Declaration of Principles agreement 
regarding the Palestinian right to control the parts of their 
homeland from which the Israeli Army withdraws and which, in the 
first stage, are the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. [passage 
omitted] 
  Al-Najjab added: We cannot forfeit this acquired right 
because that would not only make the withdrawal meaningless but 
would also clearly set a ceiling for the entity which we aim to 
set up, making it just autonomy under full Israeli control with 
no prospect of development towards independence. [passage 
omitted] 
  Al-Najjab called on the Arab and international parties 
concerned with the peace process and its success to take the 
necessary steps to make the Israelis change their position and 
respect the provisions of the Declaration of Principles 
agreement and its implementation dates. He affirmed that, in 
maintaining its intransigent position, Israel tries to exploit 
the poor coordination among the Arab parties participating in 
the peace process. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Najjab urged the U.S. Administration to take firmer 
stands 
against Israeli policies and to take a more comprehensive view 
of the nature of the obstacles preventing progress in the 
negotiations instead of maintaining the current U.S. position 
which fully adopts the Israeli viewpoint. 
  In conclusion, al-Najjab stressed that the Israeli position 
threatening to torpedo the negotiations should be a new 
incentive for the Palestinians to close their national ranks, 
eliminate all the loopholes that have emerged, and open the way 
for national dialogue on two fronts, the first being the front 
of the forces which support the agreement, and the aim here 
should be to enhance the Palestinian leadership's performance, 
develop the PLO's methods of work, and increase participation of 
representatives of all Palestinian groups and forces inside and 
outside the occupied territory in the current political process 
and in the process of national reconstruction. 
  The second front, he said, is that of the Palestinian 
patriotic forces opposed to the agreement with whom dialogue 
should continue because the disagreement between the two fronts 
is about the means and not the aims. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Bilal al-Hasan: "The Nine Points Are Not the </F>
Solution"] 
  [Text] If we examine the nine points conveyed by a 
Palestinian delegation headed by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi to 
Yasir 'Arafat and the PLO Executive Committee, we would conclude 
quite simply that even if Yasir 'Arafat fully accepted all nine 
points, this would not resolve the PLO's crisis. The crisis 
would continue and get worse. 
  The nine points call for the formation of committees, 
leadership bodies, development councils, and planning and 
consultation bodies. They contain no political substance, but 
the problem is basically one of political substance. 
  It was the absence of an agreed political concept that 
prompted the call for reform, the drafting of a memorandum 
urging reform, and the dispatch of a delegation headed by 
'Abd-al-Shafi to discuss the issue of reform. 
  For instance, the Taba negotiations are going through a 
crisis at present. The negotiations are led on the Palestinian 
side by Dr. Nabil Sha'th. If a committee was formed to 
participate in the negotiations with him, would that make a 
difference to the negotiation outcome and would it mean a 
certain change for the better? Of course not, because the 
presence of a committee with Sha'th would not make him more 
eloquent in expressing the Palestinian position and would have 
no effect on the nerves and morale of the Israeli negotiators. 
  It is a question of Palestinian "policy." Palestinian policy 
is the point of contention. That is what should be discussed 
with 'Arafat. After that and once agreement is reached on that, 
it would be easy to form committees and we might discover that 
there was no longer a need for such committees. 
  We have, over a period of some months, witnessed conflicting 
Palestinian policies. There was the policy pursued for 11 
rounds in the Washington bilateral negotiations and then there 
was the policy which emerged in the Oslo secret talks and 
torpedoed all foundations of the negotiations held in Washington 
and the efforts to impose the idea of Palestinian sovereignty 
there, and then there was the third policy pursued in the Taba 
and Cairo negotiations raising the question of sovereignty again 
through insistence on the issue of the crossings and their 
control. 
  Now, with the unconditional -- as they say -- resumption of 
the Taba negotiations we are seing a fourth aspect of 
Palestinian policy. That could mean dropping the formal demands 
on sovereignty and accepting just symbolic verbal or practical 
hints. 
  These conflicting Palestinian policies denote a lack of 
strategy, absence of vision, absence of constant principles, and 
absence of red lines. They also reflect a Palestinian crisis. 
It is a political crisis. A political dialogue is needed for 
resolving that crisis but many people feel that it is now too 
late for that because the decisionmakers had already made up 
their minds and signed the Oslo agreement, and that it is now up 
to them to pluck out their own thorns with their own hands. 
  The Palestinian crisis is no longer a crisis between 
hardliners and moderates or between romantics and realists or 
between accepters and rejecters and therefore it is not a matter 
for committees or committee debates to solve. The crisis is now 
between those who believe in a Palestinian pan-Arab position and 
those advocating cooperation with Israel's genius or who dream 
of Palestinian regional concept. It is now a battle between 
continuation of the fedayeen factions hegemony over Palestinian 
political action or new hegemony of the social forces over 
political action. These matters are the crux of the crisis and 
that is what should be discussed regardless of whether or not 
the nine requested committees are formed.

  [Text] The Board of Governors of the Palestinian Economic 
Council for Development and Reconstruction [PECDR] met in Tunis 
9-11 January 1994. Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], 
president of the state of Palestine, PLO Executive Committee 
chairman, and head of the Palestinian National Authority, 
attended the meeting. 
  The PECDR Board of Governors adopted the following 
decisions: 
  At its third regular session on 9, 10, 11 January the PECDR 
Board of Governors decided the following: 
  The Board of Governors has discussed the statutes of the

the issuance of the relevant decree. 
  At its third regular session on 9, 10, 11 January, the PECDR 
Board of Governors decided the following: 
  1. After listening to the report submitted by the committee 
tasked with studying the applications for filling the vacancies 
in the departments and sections, and in view of the fact that 
interviews with candidates have not been completed, and to give 
more qualified Palestinian candidates the chance to submit their 
applications to fill these vacancies, the following has been 
decided: 
  1. [as heard] To extend the period during which applications 
can be received for filling the vacancies that have been 
announced until 25 January 1994. 
  The under-mentioned brothers, upon the recommendation of the 
director general on 10 December 1993, will be tasked with the 
temporary supervision of the board's main departments. [5 second 
break in reception] 
  --Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman Hamad, to supervise the 
department of projects. 
  --Brother Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, to supervise the economic 
policies department. 
  --Brother Sami al-Tarazi, to supervise the technical 
assistance department.

  --Brother Hasan Abu-Libdah, second deputy director general 
will head the supervisors team. 
  A PECDR bureau will be immediately established in the Gaza 
Strip near the main headquarters and the brother director 
general, the delegated member, will be tasked with carrying this 
out after consultation with the members of the Board of 
Governors who are present in Palestine. 
  The above-mentioned brothers shall be seconded from their 
organizations and will be compensated for their salaries 
throughout their secondment period until action is taken on the 
applications on condition they fully devote their time to this 
task during the temporary period. 
  Each of the mentioned brothers will, in the field specified 
for him, carry out the duties of supervisor of the department, 
nominate those who are qualified to work in its various 
sections, and start exercising the duties of the department 
throughout the temporary period and until directors are seconded 
or appointed. 
  The brother members of the Board of Governors residing in 
Palestine will provide the final authority in the field for 
these departments and the staff nominated to work in their 
various sections, as well as for the works assigned to them, 
including tenders, contracts, and so forth. Work will be run in 
full coordination with them. The brother members are: 
  --Brother Ibrahim al-Daqqaq, coordinator for the PECDR

final decision naming the heads of departments. The posts of 
directors will remain vacant until the next meeting, taking into 
account what is stipulated in Article 2-1 [as heard, no article 
2-1 anywhere in the item] below. 
  The committee charged with choosing the nominated persons 
will continue its work to search for qualified persons to fill 
the posts of heads of the five departments. 
  The director general will contact the brothers charged with 
supervising the departments and specify their provisional tasks 
and allocate the budgets needed for their work. 
  The seconded brothers can be permanently appointed in their 
current posts or nominated for other posts in line with the 
civil service structure and in accordance with the regulations, 
guidelines, and criteria specified by the Board of Governors. 
  Dr. Antoine Dahlan is charged with completing the guidelines 
and regulations to build the PECDR in coordination with the 
director general and the supervisors of departments and the 
donor international parties. He will then present them to the 
Board of Governors, which will in turn issue them in their final 
form. It must be stressed that the basic tasks of departments 
must be completed before the next meeting. The budget necessary 
for this task will be allocated in coordination with Dr. Dahlan, 
and as necessary. 
  The coordinator, in cooperation with other PECDR members, is 
charged with executing the Board of Governors' earlier decision 
to lease a headquarters for the PECDR in Jerusalem and provide 
the necessary furniture and equipment. 
  Brother Hasan Abu-Libdah is appointed second deputy director 
general. He is to work full time for that mission. He is also 
appointed permanent member of the Board of Governors by virtue 
of his post. He will remain director of the Palestinian 
Statistics Center in Palestine. Meanwhile, a brother will be 
charged with running the center under his supervision. 
  The director general will present a report to the next Board 
of Governors meeting detailing progress made in implementing the 
board's decisions.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj in </F>
Bethlehem by Fayiz al-Minufi in Cairo within the "Dialogue From 
Afar" program; date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Al-Minufi] Good morning, Mr. Ilyas. 
  [Frayj] Good morning and welcome. 
  [Al-Minufi] With the peace talks now under way between the 
Palestinians and the Israelis in Taba, we are surprised by the 
Israeli Government's decision to build a new settlement on Mount 
Olive. In your view, what are the reasons for this action? 
  [Frayj] I denounce the confiscation of Arab land and the 
construction of settlements during negotiations and following 
the signing of the agreement and the mutual declaration [between 
Israel and the PLO]. This is not a sign of goodwill and casts 
doubts on Israel's desire for peace. I believe that this action 
has more arrogance than benefits for Israel. Mount Olive is 
densely populated and every inch of it is owned by Arabs, 
including the monasteries that have been in existence on this 
holy mountain for 2,000 years. 
  [Al-Minufi] The negotiations being held in Taba between the 
Palestinians and Israelis have achieved positive results within 
the civilian committee, but there is still stagnation within the 
security committee. What is the reaction in the Palestinian 
street to these talks? 
  [Frayj] There is mistrust among the Palestinians. This 
mistrust is deepening day by day. The Israeli measures in the 
occupied territories are worsening. They are not easing the 
tension, they are not allowing family reunions or freeing 
Palestinian prisoners, etc. The mistrust is deepening and could 
have a negative impact on the peace process. 
  [Al-Minufi] April is the deadline for implementing the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, but so far the 
two sides have not settled the differences impeding the 
implementation of the agreement. What effect this could have on 
the Palestinians? 
  [Frayj] According to the information we receive from the 
talks in Taba, there is tangible progress on the transfer of 
powers, but some (?difficult) obstacles remain regarding the 
security issues. Judging by the information we received from the 
Palestinian delegations, I believe that the Israeli troops will 
begin withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho before 13 April.

<F P=106> [By Salim Tayah] </F>
  [Text] Tulkarm, QUDS PRESS -- A Palestinian leader has said 
that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] supports "the launching 
of a comprehensive national dialogue." 
  Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, a leader of the Hamas deportees in 
south Lebanon, added that such a dialogue "will constitute a 
means for the Palestinian people, inside and outside, to avoid 
the calamities of the coming period, the self-rule period." 
  Al-Zahhar doubted the seriousness of Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat's invitation to conduct such a dialogue, and said: 
I hope that the intention is not merely to hold a meeting." He 
urged the Palestinian factions "not to participate in this 
dialogue unless its objective is explained to them in advance." 
He called on the Palestinian leadership to formulate "a 
political program vis-a-vis the program of the opposition 
factions for retrieving full Palestinian rights." 
  Al-Zahhar added that "many previous meetings with 'Arafat 
were just maneuvers in advance of participation in the ninth 
round of talks, which led to circumventing the issue of the 
deportees." 
  A series of meetings between PLO leaders, headed by Yasir 
'Arafat, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad failed to adopt a unified 
stance on the peace talks and the deportees' issue. 
  Al-Zahhar vehemently denied reports that Hamas intends to 
participate in the self-rule elections. He said: We will 
neither take part in self-rule elections nor in self-rule 
institutions. He added: However, in the past we participated 
and will participate in every professional and popular elections 
that serve the Palestinian public, without any relation to the 
self-rule authority.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, member of the Popular </F>
Front for the Liberation of Palestine Political Bureau, who 
resigned his post as a PLO Executive Committee member to protest 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement, by Usamah al-Rantisi; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Rantisi] As the opposition, 
what will be your position if the Syrians sign an agreement with 
the Israelis? 
  [Malluh] We have from the very beginning, since the Madrid 
conference, opposed the proposed settlement. We opposed it 
while Syria was involved in it. Therefore, our opposition was 
not directed against the Palestinian party alone, and it did not 
start with the signing of the Oslo agreement. Of course, as a 
Palestinian faction, our role and action should concentrate on 
the Palestinian arena. At the same time, we believe that the 
current negotiations will yield certain results between Syria 
and Israel and between Jordan and Israel. 
  We in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
believe it is unfair to view us from the perspective of our 
presence in Syria. The front is not hostage to this or that 
place. We are present where the Palestinian people are. I 
would not be revealing a secret when I say that our 
organizational presence in Syria is the weakest link of our 
presence as far as we are concerned. This is due to the size of 
the Palestinian presence in Syria. So our opposition is not 
linked to this or that Arab party. True, we may face some 
difficulties if the Syrian-Israeli negotiations achieve results 
in the near future, but this will not change our position on the 
settlement and its threats to the [Palestinian] cause. When we 
believe in a political stand, we will not allow the geography 
factor to influence us. You remember our position in the unity 
experience of 1987, the war of the camps, and other events. 
  We are interested in finding positions for ourselves. It is 
our right to do so in order to move freely and say what we 
believe in. Our search for contradictions in the settlement 
equation in order to benefit from it is one thing, but our 
position on the Oslo agreement and its liquidationst results is 
another. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Abu-Dhabi, 13 Jan (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
has announced that Egypt has requested that the issue of 
reviving Arab solidarity be included on the agenda of the next 
Arab League meeting, and has noted Egypt's support for the 
initiative of United Arab Emirates [UAE] President Shaykh Zayid 
Bin-Sultan on this matter. 
  In an interview with the UAE paper AL-ITTIHAD today, Musa 
affirmed that there are no differences among the Damascus 
Declaration member countries. He said: Efforts and political 
views are unified and everyone supports the peace process. We 
all are against extremism and want economic reform and our 
stances on all problems and crises are unified. 
  He added that turning the Damascus Declaration into an 
economic bloc is a good idea and that it is important that we 
should ensure the success of this idea. He said that there is 
an enormous opportunity to revive the Damascus Declaration 
because there is a consensus on the need to support it in the 
face of regional developments. 
  Musa expected the Syrian-U.S. summit to give momentum to the 
Syrian-Israeli track of the peace negotiations and said that the 
situation will become extremely dangerous if the summit yields 
nothing. 
  He noted that Syrian-Egyptian coordination in economics and 
development has accomplished a great deal, and that this is an 
age of cooperation and interests and not one of slogans. 
  On Egypt's view of reviving Arab solidarity, the Egyptian 
foreign minister said that there are some impediments, 
especially after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, that should be 
addressed. He added that contradictions still exist and that 
there are foreign currents that are trying to subvert the Arab 
region under various themes to undermine stability in the Arab 
world. Our task, he said, is to create stability in the Arab 
world, but this will not work without economic reform and 
genuine solidarity. He said that the issue should be discussed 
quietly and that we must be ready for change and deal with it 
united.

  [Text] Egypt has sent a protest note to the Sudanese 
Government over its plans to build a dam on the Nile north of 
Khartoum. In the note, which was delivered by Egyptian 
Ambassador in Khartoum Hasan Jad-al-Haq last week, Egypt 
rejected the construction of any project on the Nile that could 
affect its share of water in accordance with the 1959 
water-sharing agreement signed by the Nile basin countries. 
  Meanwhile, the Irrigation and Foreign Ministries are 
preparing scientific and political studies to confront any such 
project in the future. 
  This topic is expected to be placed on the agenda of the 
upcoming meeting of the Egyptian and Sudanese foreign ministers.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Jan (MENA)--During talks held today 
chaired by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, Egypt and France reached agreement to 
convene a ministerial meeting of foreign ministers of 
Mediterranean countries next summer. 
  In the joint news conference held with Alain Juppe after the 
talks between them, 'Amr Musa stated that the objective of such 
a meeting is to strengthen relations of cooperation in the 
Mediterranean Sea region and specify the fields of action in 
this direction. He clarified that this meeting will be preceded 
by a preparatory meeting attended by intellectuals and 
diplomats. The Egyptian foreign minister said his talks with 
his French counterpart touched on current international issues, 
topped by the peace process in the Middle East, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Mediterranean Sea area, and bilateral 
relations between Egypt and France. 
  During the news conference, Juppe affirmed that they 
discussed problems of a regional and international nature, 
concentrating on the peace process, which is backed by Egypt and 
France, as well as cooperation within the framework of the 
Mediterranean basin. 
  He said France asserted its interest in cooperation among 
the 
Mediterranean Sea countries, adding that it is one of these and 
is interested in every aspect of cooperation among them, 
politically, economically, and socially. It is also interested 
in establishing peace in the region. 
  Juppe praised Egypt's role in pushing the peace process 
forward as decisive and active. France is also interested in 
pushing this march forward, since it has hosted the Palestinian 
and Israeli negotiators.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Jan (MENA)--Visiting French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe has described his talks with President 
Husni Mubarak and other Egyptian officials as positive and 
fruitful. 
  He said in a news conference this evening that Egypt and 
France are willing to promote their relations, especially in the 
fields of investment, culture, and encouragement of 
Francophonism in Egypt. 
  On the Middle East peace process, Juppe said France has 
supported this process since the Oslo declaration, and is eager 
for its timetable to be implemented so that it will not be 
obstructed. 
  He emphasized the importance France attaches to Lebanon's 
fate in the comprehensive regional settlement. Lebanon's 
sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity must be 
preserved, and the settlement must not be achieved at Lebanon's 
expense, he said. 
  Juppe said that in his talks in Egypt, cooperation in the 
Mediterranean region was discussed. Egypt and France represent 
a Mediterranean power, and we are determined to intensify our 
dialogue in the economic and security spheres, he said. 
  He said Egypt was the first to call for a Mediterranean 
forum, and added: We have contributed to this idea since 
November, and 'Amr Musa and I decided this morning to prepare 
for a semi-official meeting next summer "in the same way 
unofficial European meetings are held." 
  On the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the NATO 
meetings, Juppe said his country accepts any criticism except 
that of being careless. He said France made the biggest efforts 
to stop the tragedy and sent 6,000 soldiers to that region. He 
noted that those soldiers are subject to many risks, and that 
there have been many victims. 
  The French minister said his country has also sent 
humanitarian relief and transferred hundreds of millions of ECUs 
for relief operations, which is a tremendous European and French 
effort. 
  Juppe said that in the recent NATO meeting, France demanded 
that the question of Bosnia-Herzegovina be listed on the agenda 
although everybody else asked that the issue not be discussed. 
  He explained that the 16 NATO members supported the European 
political plan, which says that each community must have enough 
land to survive and have its own outlet as a basis for a 
peaceful settlement. 
  If this plan is signed, he said, those countries will be 
ready to send some 50,000 soldiers to the field. He added: The 
United States has expressed readiness to contribute half this 
force, and we are ready to help the United Nations implement its 
resolutions by sending planes today if we are asked. However, 
no one asked us to attack Serbian positions. 
  Juppe said there are issues related to two security regions. 
The first is Srebrenica, around which the Serbs are tightening 
the noose and where France expressed readiness to replace the 
Canadian forces, which are willing to withdraw. The second is 
Tuzla airport, which is under shelling by Serbia. 
  Juppe said France demanded that Tuzla airport be reopened, 
and French planes will land there to deliver humanitarian aid. 
If we are attacked, we will retaliate, he said. 
  He stressed that the peaceful solution is the actual 
solution, and for it to happen, the formation of a court to 
punish those who violate human rights and perpetrate crimes 
against their peoples must be considered. 
  The French foreign minister pointed out that his country 
made 
great financial efforts concerning the Bosnian problems, 
spending 500 million ECU. It has also made several initiatives 
over the past nine months, but all these efforts failed, and 
that is why we were active in the NATO meeting a few days ago, 
he said. 
  Juppe noted the possibility of misunderstanding the 
international and European positions toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
especially by the Islamic world. He said Egypt is affected by 
this misunderstanding, where Europe is accused of abandoning 
Bosnia and allowing human rights violations there to go 
unpunished. He said: But today is not September 1991; it is 
January 1994. Things have changed, and Europe is now right in 
drafting the only peace plan proposed. 
  The French foreign minister pointed out that the operations 
concerning Srebrenica and Tuzla are useful for humanitarian 
purposes, but will not solve the basic problem. He stressed the 
need to work out a peaceful plan to stop the bloodshed and 
reinforce the airlift to Sarajevo. He said: We warned the 
Serbs that we would attack them from the air if they fail to 
comply with these resolutions. 
  If the NATO resolutions are not implemented, he said, the 
alliance's prestige will be put to the test. 
  Asked about the restoration of relations between the Vatican 
and Israel, Juppe expressed the belief that this is natural, 
positive and it helps advance the peace process. "If the PLO 
has recognized Israel, I wonder why the Vatican should not," he 
said. 
  He said the Oslo accord will not solve the problem of 
Jerusalem, which will be solved later. 
  Asked about France's position toward Libya and Iraq, Juppe 
said: Concerning Libya, we demand that the UN resolutions and 
international law be implemented. We also demand that Iraq 
implement the UN resolutions. He noted that Iraq had 
implemented some resolutions, but said that all resolutions must 
be implemented. 
  Juppe called for destroying all mass-destruction weapon 
networks in Iraq; ensuring the safety of Kuwaiti territory; 
Iraq's recognizing the borders and refraining from changing 
them; and Iraq's refraining from practicing violence against 
population centers. 
  The French foreign minister said: I would like to point to 
some progress concerning Libya. I have heard information on 
this topic and have read how far things have gone concerning 
some proposals, but no progress has been made in this field. 
  On French-Iranian relations, Juppe said that his country 
shared the European view which stresses the need for a critical 
dialogue with Iran. He said the policy of isolation toward that 
country is futile. We will ask for official guarantees that 
Iran will abandon terrorism and respect international laws, he 
said.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I asked the president: Let us 
move on to political matters. When will the national dialogue 
that you called for during the opening of the parliamentary 
session of the People's Assembly and Consultative Council start? 
  The president answered: It is most likely that the dialogue 
will start in mid-February. Studies continue now and meetings 
are taking place with many figures since the dialogue includes 
all national forces. 
  In his special statements, President Mubarak spoke about his 
hopes for his citizens during 1994 and what he wants from them 
so that Egypt would always remain cherished, honorable, strong, 
and stable. 
  I asked the president: What would you like to tell the 
people with the beginning of the new year? 
  He answered in an optimistic tone laced with warm 
intonations 
of love and cordiality: I wish them goodness, the best of 
things. Egypt is our country. It is our duty to provide it with 
everything that will elevate it and realize progress for it, 
especially since its sons are the best, happy to be sheltered 
under its wings. Undoubtedly, Egypt will never be ungenerous 
with its own sons. 
  At the same time, I tell our young sons: Do not be misled by 
calls of perversion. Do not get involved in any terrorist 
operations the objective of which is Egypt's stability and 
security, no matter what the material temptations or 
psychological pressures are, because, in the end, you will pay 
the price yourselves and you will be harmed by your own actions. 
  The president then added: Those who are trying to exploit 
you want to destroy the country. But Egypt will never be 
ruined, thanks to God's help and protection and the cohesion of 
its sons. I hope all the parties will contribute toward 
confronting terrorism which does not differentiate among people. 
Everyone, without exception, will suffer from the negative 
effects of terrorism. 
  The president said in his exclusive statements: I hope every 
citizen will work to increase production and plan his family, 
because a population increase has dangerous repercussions. Our 
responsibility is to balance revenues and expenditures. We need 
to understand that this cannot be realized so long as population 
growth continues at the same rate. 
  Mr. President, what do you want to tell the Arab brothers 
with the beginning of the new year? 
  President Mubarak answered: I call on the Arab brothers to 
close past files. We should all start a new age based on 
solidarity and unity, and away from hegemony and control. All 
the people of the world cooperate with each other for joint 
interests. Therefore, how nice it would be for us Arabs to heed 
the experiences of others, especially since our potentials and 
resources in various fields are huge and varied. [passage 
omitted] 
  Concluding his exclusive statements, President Mubarak 
affirmed that Egypt has exerted and continues to exert huge 
efforts to push the peace process forward out of its conviction 
that the people of the region should live in friendship and 
build their lives on new bases. 
  We are trying as much as possible to overcome difficulties 
with the objective of bringing viewpoints closer so that we can 
realize our objectives. 
  Mr. President, are you optimistic that the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement will soon be implemented? 
  The president answered with optimism and confidence: God 
willing, the Gaza-Jericho agreement will soon be implemented. 
These are the first steps of a permanent and peaceful solution 
and all parties know that very well.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Jan (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak held a 
meeting at the Presidential Office in Heliopolis today. It was 
attended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi; Dr. 'Atif 'Ubayd, 
minister of the Public Business Sector and minister of state for 
administrative development and environment affairs; Mahmud 
Muhammad Mahmud, minister of economy and foreign trade; and 
Engineer Muhammad Khulayf, chairman of the Egyptian Sugar 
Company. 
  The prime minister said afterward that the two basic issues 
discussed at the meeting were Egypt's economic ties with world 
and regional countries and the Sugar Company's projects, 
especially since the company has foreign investment ventures. 
He said that the company head explained these projects. 
  The prime minister said these projects include setting up a 
number of sugar factories in African and Middle Eastern 
countries. 
  He praised the sugar company, which he said enjoys a very 
strong position and has industrial equipment and a design center 
that can fulfill Egypt's needs. 
  He said sugar prices currently rise and fall according to 
the 
production costs and that there are no problems on this matter. 
  He noted that an integrated study on customs is currently 
being compiled and that it will be discussed next week with 
sugar exporters, importers, and producers to determine whether 
sugar will be subject to customs fees. 
  The prime minister said a similar meeting will be held next 
week to discuss customs fees on fertilizers between officials 
from the Ministry of Industry and Economy, national fertilizers 
companies, and customs experts.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zayn al-Ja'fari: "National Dialogue and the </F>
Duty of Protecting the Citizen's Right to Security and 
Stability"] 
  [Text] It is certain that all the political parties in 
Egypt are now fully prepared to enter into a dialogue on the 
fundamentals of national life, particularly with regard to the 
issues of security and stability. Security and stability are 
necessary conditions for the continuation of the economic reform 
and development programs. These programs have so far achieved 
results that have drawn praise from several international 
economic circles. 
  In his first meeting with the newly formed National 
Democratic Party [NDP] General Secretariat, President Mubarak 
asked the Secretariat to get in touch with other political 
parties with a view to launching a national dialogue. 
  Following Mubarak's meeting with the NDP Secretariat, 
Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said that the Secretariat 
has been in touch with all political parties. Al-Sharif said 
that there are many points of agreement with those parties and 
only a few of disagreement. This boosts the hope that the 
national dialogue will produce constructive and positive results 
that would have a beneficial effect on the country's future. 
  There is no doubt that this clear desire of the Egyptian 
political parties [to hold a national dialogue] is a response to 
the sincere call made by President Mubarak some time ago, in a 
bid to serve the interests of the country and the nation. 
President Mubarak called for that dialogue to be a fair and 
honest one in which all parties, including the NDP, should rise 
above their rivalries. President Mubarak promised that the 
NDP's role, as the majority party, will be one of creating the 
appropriate atmosphere for a successful national dialogue. 
  We have not the least doubt that we are all patriots, 
seeking 
to promote the general interest of our beloved country and 
nation. Our profound commitment to democracy, reiterated by 
President Mubarak, is an endeavor in which all of us should get 
involved. Democracy is the wind that will bring country's ship 
to safe shores. It is the only and best guarantee against 
excesses of all sorts. 
  Democracy involves much more than rhetoric. Every one of us 
should insist on democracy being upheld. We have to create the 
right atmosphere for every citizen to exercise his 
constitutional rights in such a way as to shore up the country's 
national unity and ensure that anyone who is tempted to 
jeopardize the nation's security and stability and undermine the 
livelihood of the citizens is brought to justice. 
  It is our firm belief that the responsibility of protecting 
the nation does not rest solely with the government, but is a 
joint responsibility for both the people, who care for the 
country's future prosperity, and the government. 
  A look at the circumstances through which the country and 
nation are passing is enough to persuade us that our only 
recourse is to correct our mistakes. This, of course, is easier 
said than done. It involves a strong resolve and definite desire 
to repair the damage that the evil hands have done to our 
country's security and stability. The consequences of our 
failure to do that could be grave. 
  Therefore, we affirm that the outcome of national dialogue 
will lay the groundwork for national policies for many years to 
come, during which the nation may look forward to an improvement 
in their standards through the joint effort of the country's 
political parties.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Jawad 'Ali] </F>
  [Text] The People's Assembly Committee entrusted with 
preparing the response to the government's policy statement 
continued its meetings yesterday under the chairmanship of 
deputy speaker Ahmad Hammadi. Most of the members launched a 
strong attack against the government, accusing it of failure in 
its domestic policies to serve the citizens and alleviate the 
burdens they shoulder as a result of rising prices and lack of 
services. This, they claimed, has led to an increase in 
negative attitudes and unwillingness to cooperate with state 
policy, and has given terrorists the chance to carry out 
activities to destroy the national economy. 
  Sa'd al-Shirbini, chairman of the People's Assembly Local 
Administration Committee, emphasized that terrorism is the fruit 
of indifference and negative attitudes among the people, who 
complain about prices and services and the spread of corruption 
in all state sectors. This is the reason for the rift between 
the people and the government. He called for administrative 
reform together with economic reform and for the removal of all 
reasons that have led to a negative attitude among the people. 
He also called for the genuine exercise of democracy involving 
all the parties, political forces, and the people without 
restrictions or prior conditions. He demanded that the 
retirement age must not be extended to give a chance to the 
young people to assume responsibility, prevent disappointment 
and despair, and have more effective participation in the 
process of development. 
  Faruq Mutawalli (independent) called for the formulation of 
a 
foreign policy to confront the results from the establishment of 
a Middle Eastern market, the implementation of the GATT 
agreement on international free trade, and Sudan's plan to 
establish a new dam on the Nile, which could affect Egypt's 
share of the water. 
  'Abd-al-Fattah Diyab, from the National Democratic Party, 
noted that the development of the village has become a mere 
slogan, as there is no development in the villages. This is 
despite the fact that villages are the basis of development and 
production. The government should have given villages more 
importance but this failure has led to despair among the 
peasants, who are more committed to paying taxes and 
contributing to the increase in production. He also noted that 
telephone services in the villages are very bad. What the 
government did was to install old and dilapidated telephone 
exchanges and cables just to claim that it had introduced 
telephones to the villages. They would have been better without 
it! 
  Diya'-al-Din Dawud (representative of the Nasirite Party) 
said: If no serious attempt is made to allow parties to exercise 
their activity among the people, there will be no political 
enlightenment and terrorism and extremism will always find a 
suitable climate to spread their subversive ideas among the 
youth. This is the responsibility of the government, because 
the security forces always restrict the activity of parties and 
prevent them from holding public meetings, forcing them to hold 
such meetings behind closed doors. 
  He called on the government to work for Arab unity. I call 
on President Mubarak to exert personal efforts to convene an 
Arab summit to discuss the dangers facing the Arab world, he 
said. He asked: What has happened to Egypt's unifying role in 
the Arab world?

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Jan (MENA)--Minister of Interior Hasan 
al-Alfi has stressed Egypt's interest in and extreme eagerness 
to respect human rights and said that reports on human rights 
violations in prisons are false allegations aimed at tarnishing 
Egypt's image abroad. 
  After opening an exhibition of prison agency products last 
night, he said that Egypt is an advanced state with an ancient 
civilization and respects human rights within the framework of 
legitimacy and law. He noted that respect for human rights is 
being taught at the Police Academy and at police institutions. 
  He pointed out that some hardened inmates inflict injuries 
and say they were caused by police for revenge and then claim 
afterward that they were tortured. 
  The minister of interior affirmed the security forces' 
eagerness to respect human rights and said police victims 
outnumbered those of the terrorists during confrontations. 
  Answering a question on the new security strategy in light 
of 
the Arab interior ministers conference held in Tunis recently, 
he said there is a general agreement on views on security 
because crimes of violence and terrorism are now a phenomenon 
not only in Arab countries but in the world. 
  The minister of interior said work is continuously 
developing 
to curb crime and arrest criminals by modernizing agencies and 
training personnel.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Isam 'Abd-al-Jawad in Asyut] </F>
  [Text] Some 400 people in Asyut have received weapons and 
ammunition as part of the militia that security services in the 
governorate had organized to confront terrorism. 
  But only one month after the unprecedented move, differences 
erupted among the services that were behind the idea. Some say 
a number of citizens took the weapons to defend themselves 
against a backdrop of tribal revenge actions, and others stress 
that some of those who received the weapons sold them to 
terrorists, bullies, fugitives from justice, and highway robbers. 
  ROSE AL-YUSUF has also learned that those volunteers have 
not 
received antiterrorist training. The security agencies gave 
them weapons and ammunition without telling them what places to 
guard. The volunteers were only asked to attack extremists 
wherever they see them--something that did not happen, even in 
Upper Egypt, which is known for acts of revenge. 
  Those militias were not assigned to guard government 
facilities or take part in antiterror operations. Indeed, the 
security services denied that the militias existed, and that 
only added to the militiamen's confusion. 
  Some People's Assembly and Consultative Council members, and 
members of local councils in Asyut protested to Asyut Governor 
Major General Samih al-Sa'id and Security Director Major General 
Majdi al-Basyuni over the formation of the armed militias, some 
of whose members have abused the use of their weapons. 
  An official security source told ROSE AL-YUSUF that the 
security services are now working out a high-level plan to 
change the dynamics of antiterror operations in Asyut. Most of 
the equipment and individuals used in these operations have been 
withdrawn and replaced by forces highly trained in antiterror 
techniques. A number of police cars have also been replaced 
with modern vehicles that can easily move in agricultural areas 
and on mountains where terrorists hide. 
  The source said the plan seeks coordination between Asyut 
and 
a number of neighboring governorates to cut off the supply lines 
for the terrorist groups in Asyut. 
  On the role of the militias in Asyut, the source denied they 
play any role. The source even denied they exist, although ROSE 
AL-YUSUF stressed it had seen them and named some people who had 
actually received weapons. 
  The recent killing of Brigadier General Taha Tu'aymah in 
Dayrut and the subsequent arrest of terrorist Ahmad Diya' from 
Suhaj Governorate revealed a new development in the tactics of 
the terrorist groups in Upper Egypt. Diya's participation in 
that operation showed that elements from neighboring 
governorates, especially Suhaj and al-Wadi al-Jadid, are 
involved in Asyut attacks. Those governorates are used as 
supply sources for terrorist groups in Asyut, and Asyut 
terrorists flee and hide there. Ordinary citizens in Asyut are 
increasingly talking about this, especially since Asyut has the 
biggest regional university and thousands of students from 
various governorates, especially in Upper Egypt, go to study 
there. 
  The attack against Brig. Gen. Tu'aymah was the first of its 
kind in which terrorists from different governorates took part. 
  In another development, an Interior Ministry team spent five 
days in Asyut drafting an integrated plan for coordination with 
neighboring governorates to raid terrorists' hideouts in Asyut, 
al-Minya, Suhaj, and al-Wadi al-Jadid, and to guard the eastern 
side of Asyut to prevent infiltration of terrorists via the Red 
Sea. 
  In the al-Rahmah mosque in Asyut the Friday before last, the 
Islamic Group members said prayers without making any 
announcements or statements as they usually do. The mosque 
preacher asked members of the group to leave the mosque after 
prayers in small groups to avoid clashes with the heavy security 
force around the mosque. Not many people attended the prayers. 
  Shops owned by members of the terrorist groups continue 
their 
trade activity in Asyut without security interference, although 
a number of the shops were built along pedestrian streets 
without a license. The Asyut municipality avoids arguments with 
the owners and collects taxes in a friendly way, although some 
of them refuse to pay taxes because they believe it is against 
shari'ah. 
  Meanwhile, a curfew atmosphere still dominates the cities of 
al-Qusiyah and Dayrut although the security services lifted the 
curfew and told citizens they could go out.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Kamal] </F>
  [Excerpt] ROSE AL-YUSUF has obtained a new document 
detailing the extent of the Muslim Brotherhood's secret action. 
A report published by the "Orphan Child Project in November 
1993" indicates that the Muslim Brotherhood distributes some 12 
million pounds annually. The project, which is reported to be 
the Muslim Brotherhood' new secret organ, covers 20 
governorates, and their expenditures have risen by 300 percent 
over the last three years. 
  According to the document, which bears the name "The 
Republic 
Report," the number of the Muslim Brotherhood's committees 
increased by 17 during this month. The committees are taking 
care of 154,043 orphans. Some 121,144 children receive a 
monthly payment of 10 pounds. 
  The project is being implemented by the Muslim 
Brotherhood-controlled Shari'ah Society through official 
channels. Those following up the project said it will allow the 
Muslim Brotherhood to be associated with some 150,000 children, 
who will later become sympathizers of the group. [passage

  [Excerpt] With the start of the countdown to the date of 
the national conference, political parties are moving toward 
making firm decisions on their participation in the conference. 
It is expected that the position of some parties regarding this 
matter will become clear today and tomorrow. Mennam reports: 
  [Mennam] The National Liberation Front [FLN] has been 
holding 
an emergency meeting in Hotel Aurassi since this morning. The 
meeting is due to last for two days. The meeting was preceded 
by a session of the political bureau to decide on the meeting's 
agenda, which will focus on studying the general situation in 
the country and the progress of the national dialogue. In this 
context, the meeting is expected to make a decision on the FLN's 
participation in the national conference which is due to be held 
on 25-26 January. A further report on this morning's session 
from the radio team in Hotel Aurassi: 
  [Correspondent] The FLN's Central Committee emergency 
meeting 
is being held this time amid circumstances characterized by the 
gravity of the prevailing situation in the country at all 
levels. In this context, FLN Secretary General Abdelhamid Mehri 
dealt with the situation in his opening speech in which he 
talked about his party's stance vis-a-vis the process of the 
dialogue and the developments in the country since the 
resignation of former President Bendjedid and the appointment of 
what was described by Mehri as an effective authority to run the 
transitional phase. 
  Mehri's statement included a critical view of the way the 
dialogue has been handled and the way the Higher State Council 
[HCE] has been running the country's affairs. In the opinion of 
the FLN's leading official, the results reached have been 
negative in all spheres. The HCE assumed the role of leading 
the corrective [tashihiyah] movement and did not confine itself 
to the limits of the presidential post, according to Mehri. It 
sought to create better political parties, a better constitution 
and, in a sense, to shape the political map that has been 
created by the society. The result was that in place of what 
has been removed there is a vacuum, and this has not been 
replaced by anything better -- so much so that the authority is 
about to lose channels of communication, leaving the opportunity 
for the emergence of a lack of clarity in all the stances taken 
with a view to resolving the crisis, in Mehri's opinion. 
  Generally, Mehri repeated to the FLN Central Committee his 
previous statements regarding the absence of a debate on central 
issues, such as ways of stopping the chain of violence. As far 
as he is concerned the dialogue has focused on ways of dividing 
up posts as a means of raising the issue of how to extend the 
transitional phase. The logic applied by the FLN's leadership 
to the process of the dialogue made the secretary general regard 
the dialogue meetings as a series of meetings which were far 
away from public debates among the various sides. 
  Mehri's perception moves toward a rejection of what he 
termed 
as bearing responsibility for disinforming public opinion and 
officials. He added that his party cannot say that the dialogue 
has succeeded while thousands of families are experiencing 
helplessness and hunger, and, furthermore, the people have 
become afraid of the state. 
  We have noted the absence of former Prime Minister Mouloud 
Hamrouche and the participation of other traditional members of 
the FLN in the meeting. 
  Regarding participating in or boycotting the national 
conference, the dominant view among members is that there is a 
possibility that the Central Committee will recommend the 
political bureau to make the FLN's final decision. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] After a visit to the Spanish capital, Madrid, 
Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri is in the Portuguese 
capital, Lisbon, today. 
  Mr. Dembri spoke of the situation in Algeria, the scope of 
the national dialogue conference and other issues. A report 
from Lisbon by our television correspondent Samia Azi: 
  [Azi] Today was the first meeting between Foreign Minister 
Mr. Dembri after arriving in Lisbon airport with his 
counterpart, Mr. Durao Barroso, at the Portuguese Foreign 
Ministry. The tete-a-tete talks, which lasted more than 30 
minutes, consisted of different topics: security in Algeria, 
the national dialogue conference, and Algerian economic reform 
policy. 
  International problems were not ruled out at the two 
ministers' talks. What is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
expectations for Middle East talks, and North-South relations 
were discussed. 
  The meeting later expanded to include delegations from both 
sides. 
  [Begin Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso recording 
in 
French] I can frankly tell you that here, in Europe, we are very 
worried about the news we get from Algeria regarding security 
matters. My Algerian colleague has had the opportunity to tell 
me that some of these reports are exaggerated, that the 
situation is under control, but, frankly, we have great respect 
for Algeria and the Algerian people. We think of Algeria as a 
very welcoming country and it would be a shame to see this image 
now change abroad. [end recording] 
  In the evening, the Algerian foreign minister, Mr. Mohamed 
Salah Dembri, met Portuguese President Mario Alberto Soares. 
  Mr. Dembri told the president that Algeria always supported 
Portugal in its chosen democratic path. 
  After he met the Portuguese president, we asked Mr. Dembri: 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] As you end your meeting 
with the Portuguese president, what is your opinion of the 
Portuguese position towards what is happening in Algeria -- that 
is of course after your meeting with the president? 
  [Dembri] After Spain, our visit to Portugal appeared to be 
very useful because we did not have continuous dialogue with 
Portugal since 1987. But now, we agreed this morning with the 
foreign minister to strengthen bilateral ties and to raise them 
to the required level. 
  Political dialogue with the Portuguese authorities consisted 
of all what interests our countries bilaterally as well as 
multilaterally, while including the Mediterranean, the Maghreban 
Union and what interests us in terms of current international 
developments. 
  The Portuguese were very optimistic about the current 
developments in Algeria concerning the national dialogue 
conference and scopes for future proposals. Algeria still 
occupies its natural position and has preserved its reputation, 
well-known in the histories of countries which have reached 
independence after liberation wars. [as heard] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Economy Mourad Benachenhou by </F>
unidentified correspondent, in Algiers on 12 January -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] We have with us here Mourad 
Benachenhou, the minister of economy. Welcome, Mr. Minister, to 
Radio Algiers. To begin with, we would like you to talk to us 
about the economic and financial situation of Algeria. 
  The first question is about the policies of the treasury. 
Algeria's budget deficit in 1993 was estimated at 190 billion 
dinars; this year's budget deficit is estimated at 125.3 billion 
dinars. This question is how is this deficit going to be met, 
and what are the repercussions of it on the inflationary 
pressures which are quite high anyhow. 
  [Benachenhou] One should start by saying in the name of God, 
the merciful, the compassionate, before anything else. I would 
like to thank the radio for giving me this opportunity to 
explain a number of matters of interest relating to the 
citizens' daily life, including economic and financial problems. 
Your question was a direct and clear one and I can answer in 
two parts. I will be talking in the first part about the state 
expenses and in the second part about the revenues to finance 
such expenses. [passage omitted] 
  In order to find new revenue we have carried out a study of 
the economy and found new resources which have never been used 
before. We have included them in this year's budget. Thanks to 
these measures we have managed to reduce the budget deficit for 
this year. Nevertheless, we cannot say that we are fully happy 
with such a reduction; we would have liked to cut the deficit 
even further because the more we cut the budget deficit the 
better we can control inflation. However, we cannot go back 
overnight on our economic and social commitments. 
  [Correspondent] The 1994 budget was drawn up on the basis of 
an oil price of $18 per barrel. Some say that this price is 
very optimistic, in view of the current situation of the oil 
market and the expected development. If this price is not 
achieved in the market, what measures does the government intend 
taking to face this, because this will lead to a reduction in 
oil revenue, and ultimately perhaps increase the deficit? 
  [Benachenhou] At any rate the government has these 
expectations on the basis of studies carried out by two 
international organizations, the IMF and the World Bank. The 
studies of these two organizations are taken into consideration 
by all the states which export raw materials, that is, 
industrial and advanced states or developing states such as 
Algeria. We based the $18 price on official reports prepared by 
professional people working in the World Bank and the IMF. 
There is in fact a reduction in oil prices; there is a 
fluctuation. We do not know whether the price will go up or 
down. We had to make a decision in order to prepare the budget 
of this year and this decision -- as I have said -- was based on 
international studies which are internationally guaranteed for 
their feasibility. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent ] This year's budget includes for the first 
time a clause on bankruptcy and legal settlement with regard to 
public enterprises; is this clause an indication of an effort to 
overcome the problem of the fate of the public sector and public 
enterprises? 
  [Benachenhou] We can say two things regarding the role of 
the public sector in the economy. First, the public sector's 
share of this country's production is 65 percent. Second, the 
public sector, including the administrative and industrial 
sectors, employs about one third of the work force in the 
country. When we start talking about the reorganization of the 
public sector we are talking about the reorganization of almost 
the whole of the Algerian economy, and even the reorganization 
of Algerian administrative departments. There is no economic 
scope for a country in which there is no direct or indirect 
intervention. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Still with the budget law: This year's 
budget has envisaged reduction of some taxes, i.e. the tax on 
companies profits, and the reorganization of the income tax as 
well as a reduction in VAT [value added tax] and the abolition 
of compensatory tax. Also this year's budget envisages for the 
first time the provison of extra revenue, about 50 billion 
dinars, through combating tax evasion. Will the tax authorities 
have the material and human resources to be able to face up to 
tax evasion? Also, aren't you afraid that tax reduction will 
lead to less revenue for the state? 
  [Benachenhou] I would like to stress here that this 
government is determined to fight tax evasion; tax is a duty and 
a right. [passage omitted] 
  As far as your second question is concerned I can tell you 
that there is no direct link between tax revenues and the level 
of tax imposed on economic activity, which is subject to 
taxation. In many instances it is better, in order to increase 
tax revenues, to reduce the percentage of the tax. And this is 
what we have done. There are instances when the high level of 
taxation would convince people that it is worthwhile to try to 
hide their earnings all together from the tax people in order to 
pay no tax at all. Hence, although we have reduced taxes, we 
are convinced that such a reduction will increase tax revenues 
because people will be more inclined to pay them. 
  [Corresponden] [passage omitted] What is the way, in the 
opinion of the government or the Ministry of Economy, for 
reviving the national economy? 
  [Benachenhou] Since its formation, the government has taken 
several measures to raise the confidence of the private sector. 
This is because, with regard to the public sector, there is a 
direct and continuous intervention by the state so that the 
level of production capability will not be lowered further than 
the current level. The government's idea is that the private 
sector has capabilities, that is to say, bigger participation in 
the revival of the economy. 
  Therefore, the government enacted the law on investment 
which 
provided tax and financial concessions, so that people in the 
private sector who have the entrepreneurial spirit and have 
ideas on investment will be encouraged and take the necessary 
measures to begin investment. This is the first thing. The 
other thing is that one knows that banks play a major role in 
the economy. The government therefore has taken several 
measures to improve the working and management conditions of 
banks so that they will participate in a more effective way in 
financing the economy and particularly in financing investments. 
The government has been working for five months only, during 
which it took legal measures, as I outlined earlier, which 
concern the financial sector and measures within the framework 
of the financial law. All these measures require time before 
they begin to have noticeable results in the market. What have 
we noticed? Generally speaking, we noticed that some kind of 
revival has taken place. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] On 15 January, an important date, talks 
resume with the IMF. For the first time since the start of the 
debt crisis in 1982, Algeria is officially announcing that it is 
unable to pay its debt service on time and guarantee a minimum 
level of imports to meet its food needs while continuing its 
other matters. What are the proposed solutions to surmount this 
problem, especially as we notice that several expressions and 
concepts are being used: some people are talking about 
rescheduling, others are mentioning a multilateral 
restructuring, and others are suggesting the cancellation of 
part of the debt? 
  [Benachenhou] The question you have just asked is extremely 
complex, and I have no immediate answer for it because we are 
still talking to the IMF and intend to be very thorough at these 
talks. We will have to discuss almost every sentence included 
in the reports presented by us and by the IMF. We must also 
discuss the figures which will define the country's internal 
financial situation and the figures which will give an idea on 
the external financial situation. When we have drawn some kind 
of a joint conclusion, which can only be drawn after we have 
resumed our talks with the IMF in the second half of January, we 
will then decide what the most effective way will be to reduce 
the external debt, because the most important thing is to 
alleviate the burden of the debt service, irrespective of the 
expressions used. This is as far as our relations with the IMF 
are concerned. 
  Moreover, there are states and international banks and 
financial institutions which have granted us loans. We must 
also hold talks with these sides in order to reach a formula 
which will take into account Algeria's interests and our 
interests [as heard]. We must now stress that the government's 
objective is to reach a formula which will enable us to 
alleviate the burden of our external debt. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you have touched on the 
relations or the talks with the IMF and you have said that these 
talks are both complex and thorough. On the other hand, we know 
that the IMF, as a financial institution which has experience in 
negotiating with countries, has almost a model prescription 
which is well known; namely, a devaluation of the dinar, a 
reduction in state intervention, and redundancies. On the basis 
of these facts and this prescription, what room for maneuver 
does the government and Algeria have in light of lower revenues 
and the collapse of oil prices? 
  [Benachenhou] I have talked about negotiations and I have 
not 
talked about obeying orders from an institution. In any case, 
Algeria is an independent country and a member of the IMF. 
Within the framework of its participation in the IMF, it has 
duties and it also has rights. These duties and rights exist in 
the context of an international agreement. There is no 
international institution which can force Algeria to take 
measures that are not in its interests or that transcend the 
international relations and legal foundations which exist 
between our country and the IMF. I should have stressed this at 
the onset. This means that Algeria has total freedom for 
maneuver, regardless of the financial and economic difficulties 
which it is experiencing. In the end, it is for Algeria to 
decide whether it is economically, financially, socially, and 
politically able to absorb the IMF's proposals and 
recommendations or whether these proposals are acceptable. 
Algeria is totally independent of the IMF regardless of its 
financial circumstances. 
  You talked about a unified model. I would like to say that 
this model is not a model that can be exported directly from one 
country to another. Every country has its own peculiarities 
regarding its economic and financial structure. Any measure 
that will be taken or that is agreed upon in the framework of an 
IMF program must take into account the country's social, 
financial, and economic peculiarities and also the country's own 
economic and financial structure. If we had found ourselves in 
the clear situation which you talked about and in which there 
would be a unified formula that is applied to all the countries, 
then there would be no need for talks and we would ask the IMF 
to send us the list of its measures and we would start 
implementing them. Then we would ask the IMF: Please send us 
the money. This is clear. Negotiations are taking place in the 
real sense of the word. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency, you spoke about 
negotiations with the IMF and stressed that they were 
negotiations and not a model prescription. But no doubt the 
issue of the national currency will be raised with the IMF. We 
note in the market that there is a wide gap between the official 
rate, which is about 4.5 dinars to the franc, and the black 
market where the rate sometimes reaches 13 dinars to the franc. 
How will the problem of the dinar be settled with the IMF, 
bearing in mind that there are people who are saying that the 
dinar should be devalued by 50 percent, and others who say that 
the devaluation should be gradual, 1 percent per month? How 
will the problem be settled? 
  [Benachenhou] Regarding this problem, it is linked to 
several factors; there is no direct solution, nor a direct 
decision with regard to the value of the currency because this 
rate is linked to other things, including issues which we spoke 
about earlier, such as the financial deficit and how to finance 
the deficit. The problem is not that of a financial deficit, 
but of financing it by existing revenues. In other words, the 
financial deficit has no influence over the value of the 
currency. I do not want to conceal from you that when we speak 
to the IMF we cover all issues relating to the economy and 
finance, including the budget, foreign trade, the value of the 
currency, and so on. But the value of the currency is the 
result of the influence of several factors which are linked to 
the method of issuing the currency to finance the economy and to 
the way in which the economy functions and its effectiveness, 
meaning the production capability available in the economy. 
People have noticed a kind of fall of the dinar in the black 
market. I wish to stress two things with regard to the black 
market: one, what is the value of the deals which are being made 
within this black market? I do not know. Are these deals 
marginal in comparison with the volume of all the deals which 
are made within the economy? Has the parallel market got a 
bigger role than one can imagine? No one can provide you with 
an analysis of this. We know and cannot deny that there is a 
black market, and that the value of the dinar in the black 
market is less than the official value of the dinar. But there 
is no direct connection between this black market value and the 
real value of the dinar. If we tomorrow totally free the value 
of the dinar; if, for example, tomorrow the Central Bank decides 
to totally cease fixing the value of the dinar, will this value 
fall to the level of the black market value or not? No one can 
tell you. Besides there are no capabilities to estimate or 
calculate this. What concerns us at this time is to know that 
the government within the framework of negotiations with the IMF 
does not accept suggestions which cannot be economically, 
financially, and socially absorbed, no matter what these 
suggestions may be, and even suggestions relating to the value 
of the dinar. 
  [Correspondent] We must not forget that there is a 
psychological facet concerning the dinar which is greater. 
Maybe the situation would change if the Central Bank declared 
its revenue. 
  [Benachenhou] This is true. There is a psychological facet. 
We can say that there is a flaw in the method of financing 
revenues in this country. There are matters [word indistinct] 
linked to trade which could influence the value of the dinar in 
the black market. Consequently, we must not take that value as 
a gauge. We must set the real value of the dinar within the 
framework of the market where there is supply and demand for the 
dinar and for hard currency. 
  [Correspondent] The other issue which is always raised with 
that of the IMF is the issue concerning public sector 
enterprises. In this year's budget, nearly 80 billion dinars 
have been earmarked for the financial reform of these 
enterprises and their restructuring. This restructuring 
requires a mass reduction in the workforce. Has any final 
decision been taken by the government and the Economy Ministry 
and what are the expected effects on the unemployment rate, 
which is already high at nearly 25 percent? 
  [Benachenhou] Indeed, 76 billion dinars have been earmarked 
in this year's budget for the reorganization of the public 
sector enterprises. This huge amount of money highlights the 
state's commitment to take all the necessary measures to 
revitalize this sector and maintain the economic and social role 
it is playing at the moment. Moreover, the problems concerning 
the restructuring of the public sector are very marginal for the 
IMF institution gives us some recommendations on ways to come 
out of the crisis. It is our duty as a state to take all the 
necessary measures to enable this sector to contribute more to 
the revival of the economy. This contribution is linked to the 
difficult conditions which the Algerian economy is going through 
and also to the way these enterprises are managed internally. 
What are we going to do? We are going to adapt these 
conditions imposed on the public and private enterprises alike. 
However, these public enterprises must, as independent 
enterprises, also take numerous measures to improve their 
management and reduce the costs which are not directly linked to 
their production capacity. In any case, we cannot say that 
these enterprises are waiting for the IMF recommendations to 
take these measures; several measures have been taken with the 
collaboration of the social partners. I must once again stress 
that the restructuring and reform of the economy will not be 
done at the expense of a given social category. This must be 
clearly understood. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, still on the same subject. 
When we compare figures of the study for 1992, we find that the 
amount earmarked for financial reforms was 160 billion dinars, 
in 1993 it was 83 billion, and this year it is estimated at 76 
billion. Every year, since 1990, we have been saying that the 
reorganization of public enterprises would be completed that 
year. Yet, every time the same problem is raised in the same 
way. For example, workers' wages are not being paid by many 
enterprises. Is it possible for the state to continue financing 
them in this way? 
  [Benachenhou] The state has decided on new bodies for the 
running of public enterprises. I am talking about the 1989 
laws. Their aim was to raise the level of economic and financial 
responsibility of those enterprises. Within this framework, the 
state set in motion a number of financial measures in order to 
restore some financial balance and organization in those 
enterprises to enable them to become independent. 
  The state has played its role to make those enterprises have 
an independence built on clear and rational bases. However, for 
many reasons, some of which are internal to the public 
enterprise and others connected to the difficult financial and 
economic conditions experienced by Algeria, those enterprises 
were not able to reach the required financial balance. 
Therefore, the state continued to contribute to the financing 
or refinancing of those enterprises from the funds allocated in 
the budget for financial assistance. 
  As a government, we are hoping that the time will come when 
the enterprises will be able to contribute more toward the state 
budget than allocated to the running of the enterprises. 
However, circumstances make it necessary for us to support 
public enterprises for economic reasons because they have a 
great production capability, and for social reasons too. Those 
enterprises employ a large number of people and the rate of 
unemployment would rise if those people were not employed. 
  [Correspondent] Negotiations started recently with the 
General Union of Algerian Workers. Some are saying or proposing 
that, since prices are rising rapidly and that there is shortage 
of numerous basic commodities, wages should be index-linked and 
raised. What does the Economy Ministry think about this 
proposal? Will this lead, for example, to an inflationary 
spiral? 
  [Benachenhou] Negotiations are currently under way with the 
trade union, the General Union of Algerian Workers, which has an 
important and essential role to play in providing social 
protection for the workers. The government is listening 
seriously to all the analyses which are made by this trade union 
and which are linked to its role and mission. Several in-depth, 
frank, and lengthy discussions have taken place with this trade 
union. These discussions will continue until we reach a formula 
which will take into account the country's economic and 
financial conditions, because we cannot take any measure which 
could have a negative impact on the economic balances and which 
could lead to a rise in the inflation rate. Any rise in the 
inflation rate would make the social situation of the workers 
worse. All I can say is that we are talking to the trade union 
with an open mind, but we are talking under complex and very 
difficult circumstances. 
  [Correspondent] The minister delegate of commerce has 
announced that Algeria has expressed its intention to join GATT, 
the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade. What are the 
reasons behind this request, and, if Algeria was to be allowed 
to join GATT, what would the expected effects be on the national 
economy, since we know that Algeria exports only hydrocarbons at 
the moment? 
  [Benachenhou] In any case, several international 
organizations are in charge of financial, economic, and 
commercial affairs worldwide. Algeria is probably one of the 
very few countries which did not participate in GATT, despite 
the fact that the latter comes under the same general agreements 
governing the creation of the IMF and the World Bank. Therefore 
it was necessary for Algeria to complete its membership in these 
economic institutions and join GATT. We had to join GATT as a 
complement to our participation in the IMF and the World Bank. 
  In regards to the second part of your question, you are 
right 
in saying that Algeria exports on the whole only petroleum and 
hydrocarbons, but it must organize its foreign trade in order to 
give itself the opportunity to create and develop other exports. 
Its participation in GATT would also enable it to take part in 
the negotiations which are under way on the organization of 
international trade to the benefit of countries which have 
products to export, whether these products are raw materials or 
products that can be linked to services. In any case, GATT has 
very complex rules and arrangements which cover problems 
pertaining to the protection of the domestic market. We should 
not play down the results which we could obtain from our 
participation in GATT. Thank you very much. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Minister, and goodbye.

  [Excerpts] Gambian President Dawda Kairaba Jawara and his 
wife left Nouakchott today after a three-day official visit to 
our country. [passage omitted] 
  Earlier, President Jawara had answered journalists' 
questions. He expressed his sorrow at leaving this beautiful 
country after a pleasant and useful visit that enabled us, the 
president said, to have fruitful talks and to sign agreements 
between our countries. The Gambian president added that the 
trade ministers signed a trade agreement today aimed at 
strengthening exchanges in that field between the two countries. 
  The Gambian president said: As you have seen from the joint 
communique, we have specified other areas of cooperation in the 
energy, fishing, maritime, and air transportation fields. I 
think that all these fields will strengthen existing cooperation 
between our countries. Nothing remains except for me to thank 
my brother and friend, President Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, 
for the warm welcome and generous and brotherly hospitality that 
I and my accompanying delegation received. 
  President Jawara held a one-on-one session with President 
Taya this morning. After the session, the two presidents signed 
the final communique, which reflected their identical points of 
views on all issues discussed. They expressed their will to 
develop and strengthen the friendly relations linking the two 
countries. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Fayzah Sa'd] </F>
  [Text] Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has appointed 10 
financial advisers in charge of protecting the regime's wealth 
and oil revenues. Al-Qadhdhafi selected Central Bank Governor 
'Abd-al-Hafiz Salatini as a top adviser. Al-Salatini is to be 
assisted by 'Umar al-Manshi; 'Abd-al-'Ati al-'Ubaydi; Sadiq 
Hajjaji, the president of the Arab-Hellenic Bank in Milano; and 
Sulayman al-Shuhumi, under secretary at the Unity Ministry. The 
five men are busy transferring Libyan assets in European banks 
to private accounts. 
  The value of these assets have been estimated at $3 billion 
and were withdrawn in cash and taken in bags to Libya. Some 
funds have been transferred to secret accounts in Swiss banks 
and some to personal bank accounts in Luxembourg, Cyprus, and 
Lebanon. 
  ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the transfer of Libyan funds 
is not only taking place due to the UN Security Council 
resolution freezing Libyan assets abroad but also due to the 
current power struggle in Libya between supporters of 
Abd-al-Salam Jallud and those of al-Qadhdhafi. 
  Transfers to accounts held by supporters of both men were 
made as a measure of their loyalties to the country's strongmen. 
It is expected that Libyan oil exports will be affected due to 
the ongoing power struggle. The roads running though the oil 
fields are no longer safe. Colonel Sa'id 'Uwaydat al-Qadhdhafi, 
commander of the Seventh Division stationed in Zahunah, has been 
ordered to move some of his units to al-Yarta'ah to protect oil 
shipping docks from possible attacks by clan militia. Some 
public transportation buses lately came under attacks involving 
robbery and murder.

  [Text] According to a Libyan diplomat, Libya has at its 
disposal $18 billion in cash, which it has withdrawn from banks. 
Therefore, the diplomat says, Libya can withstand international 
sanctions for another seven years, even if it were to face an 
oil embargo. The diplomat notes that there are 4 million people 
living in Libya whose basic--subsidized--needs of such goods as 
sugar, oil, and tomato puree amount to about $1.5 billion 
annually.

<F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to Benghazi </F>
citizens; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We will not be taken for a 
ride, and we will not be trifled with another time. We have 
prepared, and training with weapons is taking place day and 
night for youths and old people and men and women. We are ready 
for confrontation in order to defend our right to live in peace, 
in freedom, and in pride on our land. 
  O brothers, we have to get ready now with one hand carrying 
weapons and the other having to carry the instruments for 
construction and production. We have, O brothers, to move now 
toward doing without the goods of the enemy, the equipment of 
the enemy. We must close our markets to the goods of the 
enemies. We must punish them economically as they have done to 
us and defy them as they have defied us and declare to them our 
determination that we will resist regardless of the 
circumstances. [passage omitted] 
  We must not underestimate the anger of the Libyan people and 
the people's revolt being carried out by the Libyan people these 
days, and we must not underestimate the factors that have led to 
the Libyan people's anger and revolt these days in all parts of 
the free Libyan land. There is an infringement of which the 
Libyan people are aware, and the Western alliance has gone 
beyond the limits, crossed the red lines, and has blatantly 
interfered in peoples' internal affairs in the name of the 
United Nations--after they have killed the United Nations and 
replaced it with themselves. [passage omitted] 
  We have offered several olive branches and have told them: 
We 
befriend whoever shows friendship to us. We have tried through 
peaceful means and through all mediation and means and put 
forward all proposals to solve any dispute between us and the 
Western states because we do not want peace to be threatened in 
the Mediterranean Sea or North Africa. We do not want new 
collapses to take place in the Arab region. 
  They know that the Libyan system, which is based on direct 
people's democracy, is the safety valve in North Africa and the 
Arab homeland. Consequently, they do not want a safety valve 
in the Arab homeland. They want to remove all safety valves so 
that the Arab homeland blows up and collapses. They are now 
working day and night to destroy Egypt on your eastern borders 
and Algeria on your western borders. They destroyed Iraq before 
that, and now the conspiracies are being hatched against Sudan, 
Syria, and Libya. [passage omitted] 
  We will not forget this Western beast that is lying in wait 
across the sea. O brothers, we will not be betrayed once more. 
There is no friendship at all between us and those enemies. 
They wanted enmity, so let it be enmity between us and them 
until doomsday. We are separated from them by trenches and 
barricades. 
  O brothers, they want to destroy peoples by depriving them 
of 
their resources, but we in Libya are not disturbed as others 
whose oil has become worth less than the price of water. 
  We welcome the deterioration of oil prices because we want 
to 
get rid of oil, and we Libyans want to get used to living 
without oil. Every day when the price of oil tumbles, we clap 
and thank God. We want the price of oil to tumble until it 
reaches nothing because they have decided to subjugate the 
Libyan people using oil. They said the wound that would hurt 
Libya was oil. They said the will of the Libyan people depended 
on oil. They said the Libyan people would give up their 
sovereignty and independence for oil. 
  They based all their calculations on oil. You have to pay 
attention to this fact. It is the enemies who are plotting so 
that Libya's revolutionary and stubborn position and its defense 
of its pride depended on oil. If the West deprived Libya of 
oil, the Libyan people would surrender. The Libyan people would 
be vanquished, would forget their pride and independence, 
enabling the West to step into their homes, to desecrate them, 
and to take them into bondage and put them on the list of those 
who have surrendered. 
  O free Libyan people, we have to understand this fact. We 
have to make decisions now as if we are without oil. We have to 
decide to live in ease as if we have no oil since the enemy has 
based all his calculations and plots on depriving us of oil to 
subjugate us. 
  What is required, brothers, is that even if oil production 
is 
not cut off, even if they do not besiege the oil, even if they 
cannot do without Libyan oil, we must make provisions and 
prepare ourselves. From now on, we must decide to live without 
oil. We must educate ourselves individually and at the family 
level to live without oil. But, brothers, we cannot live without 
independence. We would die for independence. We cannot live 
without dignity, honor, and pride on the land of our fathers and 
ancestors. [passage omitted] 
  [passage omitted] We challenge them to talk about human 
rights to Germany or Japan. They only talk about human rights 
to you--the small, weak, and downtrodden peoples. Consequently, 
these peoples must expose this falsification--this false 
language and this international hypocrisy. This is a new 
international hypocrisy and a new international decline behind 
which are economic and military forces. 
  Small peoples must only get ready for confrontation. There 
is nothing in front of them but relentless fighting for their 
independence, sovereignty, and resources. There is nothing in 
front of peoples but defense--with all their forces and by 
getting ready to wage a long battle in order to safeguard the 
resources, children, independence, sovereignty, and freedom on 
their land. The long battle is not in the interest of the 
enemies. They want a short battle and a terrorist one. They 
want to terrorize us with missiles or aircraft, their bombs or 
their empty threats. 
  Brothers, they only want to terrorize us. They want a short 
battle where we will be intimidated by them, fear them, submit 
to them, surrender oil, ourselves, our land, our heritage, our 
future, and the future of our children and grandchildren to 
them. We must resolve to face up to them and prepare for a 
long battle, with perseverance and unparalleled patience and 
courage. [passage omitted] 
  The peoples of the Arab nation are imprisoned and tied up. 
They cannot go out to the streets and squares. Brothers, 
repression and suppressing the breeze of freedom will not 
prevent peoples from engaging in revolution. On the contrary, 
the stronger the repression, oppression, and suppression of the 
breeze and the sun of freedom, the more revolutionary people 
become. The revolution is coming. The Arab nation is now 
called upon to engage in revolution to save itself and its 
future. 
  The Arab nation is exposed to danger these days, brothers. 
Palestine has been sold in an auction sale, and so was 
Jerusalem. Egypt is being destroyed on orders from the western 
forces. What is happening in Egypt is a conspiracy to destroy 
the biggest Arab state, and what is happening in Algeria is a 
conspiracy by France and the western states in order to 
undermine the Algerian revolution and the second or third 
largest Arab state. Iraq was destroyed and divided while the 
Arab nation was watching and listening. Iraq's destruction was 
also a western conspiracy. The West had ordered Iraq to occupy 
Kuwait, promising to back this occupation. When Iraq occupied 
Kuwait, the West destroyed and divided Iraq. [passage omitted] 
  They are bent on putting an end to the Arab nation, and they 
want a Jewish empire to be set up on your ruins. O Arabs, you 
must know this: A Zionist empire is coming from the Ocean to 
the Gulf, and not from the Euphrates to the Nile. [passage 
omitted] 
  Brothers, the Middle East problem will be solved when the 7 
million Palestinian people return their land of Palestine, when 
Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state, when we see 
on the map the democratic state of Palestine--not Israel, or 
Jacob, or Yitzhaq. The Middle East problem will be resolved 
when the Zionist entity is disarmed of its arms of mass 
destruction directed at every Arab state. Brothers, how can we 
recognize an alien state in the heart of the Arab homeland and 
armed with arms of mass destruction? [passage omitted] 
  O brothers, I am giving you facts and exposing the enemies' 
plans. This is what had been missing in 1911. We did not know 
anything about the plans of the European countries. We did not 
know the plan of the Italians. [passage omitted] 
  Today, I am here before you to expose the plans of these 
enemies, to expose the so-called international legitimacy, and 
to expose the so-called peace process in the Middle East. I am 
explaining the (?dangerous) conspiratorial plan against the Arab 
nation. This is not taking place against Libya only--but 
against Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, and Somalia. Egypt's turn will 
come after Iraq. They have destroyed Iraq quickly with military 
might. However, because of different conditions in Egypt and 
Iraq, they are now endeavoring to destroy Egypt through a long 
war of attrition aimed at finishing Egypt. The same plan that 
existed in the days of Jamal 'Abd al- Nasir is still being 
implemented on the Egyptian land. 
  The same is taking place in Algeria. It is a war of 
attrition carried out by the black French hand to bring Algeria 
to its knees and destroy it. 
  Then the turn of Libya and Syria will come. They believe 
that Libya's turn came before Egypt. This is a mistake. They 
started in Egypt before Libya. A war of attrition has been 
waged internally against Egypt. Orders to wage a war of 
attrition and to carry out operations near Egypt come from 
Germany, France, Britain, and America. 
  We say to those who believe that Libya is in danger that 
Egypt and Algeria are in a more dangerous situation than Libya. 
Libya is not in a dangerous situation yet. It has awakened and 
started preparing itself for confrontation. Libya will not be 
taken by surprise. First, it should cease its dependency on oil 
and move toward production. The people should be united with 
purified ranks to remove any breaches that will enable the enemy 
to infiltrate our ranks, brothers. [passage omitted] 
  These acts appear to be perpetrated internally by Islamic 
terrorist elements. This is wrong. This is the work of western 
intelligence inside Egypt. 
  What is happening in Egypt appears to be an Islamic, 
terrorist action from inside. This is not true. This is the 
action of western intelligence inside Egypt. Egypt is in danger 
before Libya. What is happening in Algeria is not the work of 
the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] as they believe. This is the 
plot of the French black hand, and behind it are the western 
states. [passage omitted] 
  Libya is luckier and in good shape because, on the one hand, 
Libya has awakened. On the other hand, it is because Libya has 
a free people capable of taking to public squares and streets. 
They are a unified people consisting of one family because the 
Libyan people reject treason, eliminate treason in their ranks. 
They are trained to carry arms. [passage omitted] 
  O brothers, I incite you to confrontation and to get ready 
for the confrontation. The battle has not yet happened, but I 
tell you that this confrontation and this battle must be long. 
We must prepare for it so that we can make it last. If it is 
long, we will triumph. If we show fear, shake, or become 
terrorized from day one, we will lose the battle forever. We 
will become slaves forever, and they will take all our wealth 
and your wives and houses as they did in the past. They will 
not take anything into consideration and will never have any 
mercy on you. 
  I tell you brothers: Do not be afraid. Do not be 
frightened. Do not tremble. Do not be intimidated. Do not fear 
them. If the battle is long and led with patience and courage, 
we will triumph in the end, and we will defeat the enemies. The 
enemy is gambling. It is seeking a quick gain without a loss. 
Your enemy is a tradesman, a capitalist seeking a market, 
wealth, gold, silver, the resources of peoples. [passage omitted] 
  Your enemy is a greedy capitalist seeking markets, who wants 
to use the power of a capitalist state, political power, and 
military power to subjugate you, so that markets are opened up 
for his products and consumer goods afterwards, and so that you 
may become a consumer market for the products of Western states. 
[passage omitted] 
  Do you want to have the same fate as that of the Somali 
people? Do you want the same fate as the fate of the Algerian 
people? Do you want to have the same fate as the Iraqi people? 
Therefore, we must prepare ourselves beginning now. This enemy 
will not retreat if we say to it: Peace be upon you; we want 
peace, and we want friendship. [passage omitted] 
  What mistake was made by the Libyan people? What threat to 
peace was made by the Libyan people? What crime was committed 
by the Libyan people? They do not have any evidence, any 
response. They have been exposed even over the Lockerbie issue. 
They have bowed their heads before the world, after 
organizations not belonging to a state and without a political 
entity have been accused. 
  It might have been perpetrated by a thug, and what would the 
Security Council do if they discovered that a terrorist such as 
Carlos had blown up the airliner over Lockerbie? What would the 
Security Council do with Article 7 in the face of Carlos. What 
if it is proved that a secret, stateless organization had blown 
up the Pan Am plane? What a predicament the Security Council is 
finding itself in now that it has been exposed. Look at the 
farce. This shows that the United Nations is finished, that the 
UN Charter is finished, that the Security Council is finished. 
It has now become the Western Security Council. The United 
Nations has become the Western United Nations against the small 
people. This is clear. 
  O brothers, I wish that good language, signs of friendship, 
and exchanges of interests between us and them would protect us 
from their evils. No, no, whatever you do, it is useless. 
  It is enough that we told France that we wanted to solve its 
case. Even the Libyan suspects in the UTA case themselves 
announced that they were prepared to stand trial in a French 
court if investigations were carried out with them first and 
proved that they needed to stand trial. The Libyan suspects 
announced it to the world and said they were prepared to be 
interrogated, and if investigations proved that they had to 
stand trial in France, they--such-and-such a person--were 
prepared to go. 
  Why has not France responded to that? France refused to 
solve its problem with Libya. That French position is against 
the Security Council, against the United Nations. How can the 
Security Council decide that Libya did not respond to the 
demands by the French investigating judge and that Libya must 
submit to the French requests? When Libya said: Let us respond 
to that investigation and even the suspects themselves said so, 
France refused to carry out the investigation so that it would 
not be humiliated. France refused to solve its problem with 
Libya. 
  We announce to the world: France refuses to solve its 
problem with Libya in support of its allies and sisters, America 
and Britain. How can the Arab countries not stick together? I 
am not talking about the people. The Arab peoples are wholly 
with us, but why is the stance of Arab governments not like that 
of the French Government? [passage omitted] 
  We want Arab governments to stand with their brothers, the 
Libyan people, as France did with its British and American 
brothers and governments. The Arab peoples are with us, are 
united with us, and are standing with us. I am not speaking of 
the people because they are poor, subjugated, tied up, or 
helpless. No Arab peoples can come out into a square like this. 
Governments are afraid of the masses, of the challenge by the 
masses, of the masses coming out to express support for the 
Libyan people. We challenge Arab governments to allow the 
masses of the Arab nation to go out to the squares and streets 
to express to the West that they are one Arab people, one Arab 
nation, one Arab cause, and have one enemy. 
  I, O brothers, am exposing to you the enemies' plot, the new 
international order that we must be aware of and in which 
friendship is useless. If you surrender, they will say: Why 
did you surrender? You have surrendered, now give me your oil. 
[passage omitted] 
  Even if you get an agent and tell him to come and rule Libya 
and get rid of the problem with the West, it will not work. 
Why? Because the West will tell him: Since you are an agent 
and you rule Libya, hand over the oil and the Libyan soil to set 
up bases, as well as the Libyan people to make them slaves, and 
political power and sovereignty. 
  That is what would happen. Therefore, why should you use an 
agent. Would you accept an agent to hand you over to America to 
solve your problem with the West? It would not work. It would 
not work. It is useless, of course. No, a thousand no's. The 
enemy is not shy. The enemy is scared, scared only of a 
confrontation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer, Navit </F>
Zomer, and Washington-based correspondent Hayim Shibi] 
  [Text] Last night, a delegation of leading Israeli 
economic figures arrived in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, for a 
series of meetings. 
  The delegation includes Labor Knesset Member Rafi Edri; Dan 
Propper, president of the Industrialists' Association; Dani 
Gillerman, president of the Union of Chambers of Commerce; Klal 
Director General David Vinshel; Eytan Sheshinsky (of Kur); Bank 
Hapoalim Chairman 'Amiram Sivan; Mikha'el Federman of the Dan 
hotels; Dov Lautman of the Delta textile company; and other 
economic figures. 
  The delegation will hold meetings with the Moroccan prime 
minister, the finance minister, the commerce and industry 
minister, the agriculture minister, and other economic figures. 
This is a reciprocal visit, returning a visit in Israel by a 
Moroccan delegation. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres attribute great importance to the visit. They met the 
members of the delegation prior to their departure, and Peres 
told them: "The time has come for Israeli-Moroccan relations to 
move forward a step, be open, and be anchored in open 
agreements." Rabin added: "Economic ties between Israel and 
Morocco constitute a practical expression of the fruits of 
peace." 
  Hayim Shibi adds: Syrian businessmen have been invited to 
attend a meeting with Israeli entrepreneurs in Washington in 
February. The Syrians have not yet responded to the invitation. 
Entrepreneurs from the Middle East are expected to attend the 
meeting, in which the U.S. Commerce Department is involved.

  [Excerpts] We greet you and are pleased to host Mr. 
'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad Husayn, the interior minister in 
fraternal Sudan, who is currently visiting the Great Jamahiriyah. 
  [Husayn] [passage omitted] There is a clear colonialist 
(?campaign). Five out of the seven states which have been listed 
as terrorist countries, and are on America's terrorism list, are 
Arab and Islamic states. And this for no reason other than 
these states have independent decisions and that these states 
want to develop and live in pride. 
  The issue is clear; they [as heard] now admit that the 
accusations on the basis of which this unjust blockade was 
imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah (?are groundless). They cast 
doubts on these accusations and all these have now collapsed. 
Despite this, the blockade continues. [passage omitted] 
  Why was Sudan put on the list of terrorist states? No 
incident has been proved and no terrorist action has been 
launched from Sudan, and Sudan has not experienced terrorism 
throughout its life. We have never heard of a Sudanese citizen 
participating in any terrorist operation. This is something 
which does not exist in the character and structure of the 
people of Sudan. When they said that they put us on the list of 
terrorist states, the Americans said that there were accusations 
by reliable sources. We told them [word indistinct] and we do 
not want these sources to be disclosed. We told them: We do not 
want you to disclose these sources, but to prove to us these 
facts. They have not been able to prove a single fact. Despite 
this Sudan was put on the list of terrorist states. 
  Former American President Carter denied this, because he 
visited Sudan [word indistinct] to announce that these 
accusations were unjustified. This is what was said by a former 
American president. 
  The issue is not about proved facts, but the whole matter is 
that any voice which is raised in the Arab nation to declare the 
pride of this nation must be silenced, and anyone raising this 
voice must have a blockade imposed on him and must be 
humiliated. This is the issue. [passage omitted] 
  We reject injustice, this unjust blockade, and this list on 
which they put whoever they want without any evidence, and we 
reject the use of international organizations and meetings for 
personal goals. The United Nations has double standards and uses 
rules and means with which people are humiliated. [passage 
omitted]

government's readiness to sit at a negotiations table with the 
rebel movement at any time or place specified by the committee 
of ministers of the IGADD states. He proclaimed the necessity 
of stopping the fighting, explaining that it affects the 
progress of negotiations between the two sides.

  [Text] The AL-INQADH AL-WATANI newspaper reports that 
Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir has issued a decision 
granting Sudanese nationality to some 1,000 Copts living in 
Sudan. The newspaper says al-Bashir gave these instructions 
during his meeting with a Coptic delegation led by Bishop 
Daniel, head of the Coptic Church in Khartoum. The newspaper 
quotes al-Bashir's allegation that the government serves all 
Sudanese, regardless of their religions and creeds!! Several 
thousand Copts and Christians live in Sudan. They originally 
came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and other Middle East 
countries. 
  The al-Bashir government has recently come under heavy 
criticism because of its continuing persecution of Christians in 
the south and the escape of over 100,000 northern Christians to 
Western states.

<F P=106> ['Uthman Mirghani report: "Resigning Sudanese National </F>
Assembly Deputy Speaker Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: National Front 
Controls Regime, Leading Sudan To Collapse"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Aldo Ajo, deputy speaker of the 
Sudanese Transitional National Assembly (parliament), has 
justified his breakaway from the Sudanese Government and joining 
the opposition by saying that the country has reached the stage 
of complete collapse. 
  In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT after he announced 
his 
decision to break away from the government, he added that 
"Sudanese citizens' conditions have deteriorated badly, and the 
collapse now includes all aspects of life, economic, social, 
political, and security." 
  Aldo Ajo accused the National Islamic Front, led by Dr. 
Hasan 
al-Turabi, of destroying state institutions. He said: At least 
40,000 people have been dismissed from civil service, the Army, 
and the other security forces. He said that many capable and 
experienced people have been dismissed and replaced by cadres 
from the Front. [passage omitted] 
  He went on: "With regard to security, no citizen feels 
secure at present. With regard to the judiciary, there is no 
longer justice in the usual sense, because most of the senior 
judges have been dismissed and replaced by judges from the Front 
throughout the country -- which has made the judiciary in the 
country a partisan body designed to protect the Front's elements 
and interests. The same applies to the police, whose elements 
have been exposed to dismissal and displacement. In a nutshell, 
there is no justice in the usual sense in Sudan." On the 
situation in southern Sudan Aldo accused the government of 
escalating the war. He said that "the government has moved the 
war to new dimensions, raising the jihad slogan for the first 
time and using Islam in an entirely unlawful manner to mobilize 
people and prompt them to fight their fellow citizens." 
  He added that "some people and imams say in mosques that 
what 
is happening in the south is not a jihad in the Islamic sense, 
but the government silences or arrests them." 
  He said that the government thinks that "forcible 
Islamization is the only means to unify Sudan." He said that 
these practices have angered many southerners and led to the 
total collapse of trust between north and south. [passage 
omitted] 
  Attacking the government's foreign policy, he said: There is 
no clear well-planned policy, and the statements issued by the 
foreign minister appears to be completely different from what is 
issued and exercised by other elements. He added: "We feel 
that Minister Abu-Salih makes statements aimed at repairing 
foreign relations, while other organizations like the popular 
world friendship organization and the Popular Arab and Islamic 
Conference, led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, continue their own 
policies. In fact the state follows the decisions and plans of 
these organizations." 
  He went on: The policy of these organizations is hostile 
toward all the Arab regimes in the region and toward the world 
as a whole, because the regime wants to export the model of its 
revolution. He said that Sudan has begun to receive extremist 
elements from outside and has begun to know terrorism for the 
first time in its history. And that "planning and training for 
the foreign extremist elements are provided in Khartoum, namely 
in places like mosques and private farms." [passage omitted] 
  On his position on the proposal of self-determination for 
southern Sudan, Aldo said that "the Sudanese have forgotten the 
separation proposals in the south since 1972. Separation was 
not even raised after the war broke out again in 1983. But the 
government's policies, its escalation of the war, and its 
raising of the jihad slogans have split the country and caused 
the southerners to raise the self-determination question once 
again." 
  He added that self-determination does not necessarily mean 
separation. But people's right to choose remains a political 
right which cannot be ignored, especially if the present regime 
continues its escalation and annihilation policies against the 
people in the south. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuwait, 14 Jan (KUNA) -- Colonel Hamad Sumayt, head 
of the human resources department, said in press statements 
published here today that a new draft law on compulsory 
mobilization has been prepared in line with future plans for 
conscription. He added in an exclusive interview with AL-WATAN: 
Our main objective is to entrench the concept of conscription, 
which has become a tangible reality. He further said that these 
endeavors are aimed at making use of the conscripts' skills and 
transferring these conscripts to the units best suited to their 
qualifications and expertise. 
  In reply to a question, Col. Sumayt denied the existence of 
favoritism or distinction between conscripts, and indicated that 
rumors in this respect are untrue and unrealistic. 
  Col. Sumayt also touched on the issue of sanctions and said: 
"The Conscription Law has given many rights to the conscript, 
and has provided for some sanctions ranging from added time to 
fines and imprisonment." He added: "If the person subject to 
military duty fails to present himself, six months will be added 
to the period of his conscription. The additional period would 
be reduced to two months if the person joined the army within 15 
days after the deadline. The person would be referred to a 
court to stand trial in accordance with Article 29 of the law, 
which provides for jail sentences or fines if he fails to 
present himself for a second time." 
  In conclusion, Col. Sumayt said: "If the person subject to 
military duty fails to present himself after the legal age of 
conscription, which is 30 years, he will be referred to a court 
to stand trial in accordance with the provisions of Article 30. 
He could then receive a maximum jail sentence of three years or 
be asked to pay a maximum fine of 1,500 Kuwaiti dinars."

<F P=106> ['Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sadiqi report: "Abu-Dhabi Rejects </F>
Tehran's Call and Renews Insistence on Peaceful Dialogue"] 
  [Text] Abu-Dhabi -- Responsible United Arab Emirates [UAE] 
sources have deplored the statements made by Iranian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Mahmud Mohammadi criticizing the UAE's 
position on the islands issue. These statements, they said, 
contained a number of unacceptable prevarications. 
  They added that the first prevarication was the description 
of the dispute between the UAE and Iran as "a misunderstanding," 
a description which belittles the UAE's just demands and its 
historical and legal rights to its three islands of Tunb 
al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu-Musa. The second 
prevarication, they said, was describing the UAE as intransigent 
despite the fact that it was the UAE which sought dialogue 
through repeated initiatives, beginning with the first round of 
negotiations between the two countries in September 1992, 
followed by the meeting between Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al 
Nuhayyan, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, and Iranian 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati on the sidelines of the 
Islamic foreign ministers conference in Karachi in March last 
year, and ending with the Iranian foreign minister's visit to 
Abu-Dhabi in May of the same year, as a result of which the UAE 
softened the intensity of its media's concentration on the 
islands issue although it was aware of the harm this could cause. 
  The sources said that the UAE has declared and continues to 
declare that it insists on a peaceful solution of the problem of 
the islands, that it seeks a resumption of the dialogue with 
Iran on that problem, and that it is Iran which is refusing to 
resume the dialogue, on the pretext that drawing up a framework 
for dialogue would mean making preconditions. 
  The sources pointed out that a dialogue without a clear 
framework is unacceptable because it would undermine the 
foundations on which the UAE efforts to regain its rights to the 
three islands are based. 
  The sources also said that the UAE does not want Iran "to 
directly acknowledge the UAE's historical and legal rights to 
the islands but to accept the principle of peaceful dialogue and 
to let international legitimacy and international law be the 
judge in settling the dispute, with the UAE expressing in 
advance its willingness to accept the verdict of international 
legitimacy whatever it may be." 
  They added that even with Iran's continued rejection of 
recourse to international law, the UAE continues to announce on 
every occasion that it insists on the principle of peaceful 
settlement, a matter received with increasing understanding by 
numerous states and political forces. 
  The third prevarication, the UAE sources said, was the 
Iranian spokesman's claim that the UAE is making preconditions 
for the resumption of dialogue when in actual fact it is Iran 
which is making such preconditions by refusing to discuss the 
islands of Tunb al-Kubra and Tunb al-Sughra and confining 
discussions to the question of administrative arrangements for 
the island of Abu-Musa. 
  The sources further said that those who followed the first 
round of negotiations, which failed to achieve any results, know 
that the Iranian delegation adamently refused to go beyond 
discussion of Abu-Musa island and refused even to listen to the 
UAE's views on the subject. 
  The UAE sources added that the fact that the Iranian 
spokesman chose to level accusations against the UAE after the 
final statement of the meeting of the Damascus Declaration 
foreign ministers seemed to be an attempt to prevent the UAE 
from raising the issue of the islands in regional and 
international circles, which is out of the question considering 
the Gulf and Arab response and the gains made at international 
level.

<F P=106> ["Press statement" by the General Committee of the General </F>
People's Congress on the ongoing political crisis in Sanaa on 11 
January--recorded] 
  [Text] The General Committee of the General People's 
Congress [GPC] held its periodic meeting from 9 to 11 January 
1994. It is a continuation of its previous meetings which it 
devoted to discussing the current political crisis in the 
country and the very negative repercussions it imposes on other 
aspects of life, foremost among which is the deterioration in 
the economic and monetary situation and its reflections on the 
daily lives of citizens who are suffering from an increase in 
prices, deterioration of the exchange rate of the national 
currency, paralyzation of life in general, and frustration of 
people's interests and transactions. Moreover, the 
repercussions of this crisis did not stop when they threatened 
people's livelihoods. Indeed, they escalated to the point of 
threatening the homeland and its people and served to warn of 
sedition and war--a war bound to cause sweeping devastation, 
falling into the claws of the schemes hostile to unity, 
democracy, and independent development. This would result in 
the loss of our cultural plan to build a country of order, law, 
and constitutional institutions, and to establish a civilian 
society based on righteousness and equality and the recognition 
of human rights. Our great Yemeni people are fully aware that 
the GPC has always sought to deal with this crisis with wisdom 
and even-handedness, arming themselves with the spirit of 
national accord, and placing national interest above all other 
considerations. The General Committee blessed the national 
dialogue and reaffirmed its commitment to the results of this 
dialogue. Today, it values the efforts of all the forces taking 
part in the national dialogue, and their continuous work toward 
arriving at solutions to the crisis. Moreover, it was concerned 
about dealing with a great sense of responsibility with all 
opinions, ideas, and proposals presented for discussion in all 
political, media, security fields, as well as issues dealing 
with building the country. The General Committee very 
regrettably noticed a host of daily acts and practices that 
contradict agreements and resolutions reached through the 
National Dialogue Committee. This clearly creates more 
complications and obstacles to reaching a national agreement to 
solve the ongoing crisis, end its repercussions, and contain its 
social, security, and psychological effects. These practices, 
for example, have taken the following forms: 
  First, failure to return the military to pre-crisis 
locations. Indeed, moves and infringements contradicting the 
spirit of national unity and political accord and threatening 
social peace have taken place. 
  Second, divisive measures that do not serve the interests of 
all sectors of the Yemeni people, that entrench factionalism and 
parochialism, and lend a party coloring to most activities, 
thus rendering them totalitarian and undemocratic. 
  Third, acts of demobilization and mobilization, the creation 
of armed units and militias, and parading military forces in a 
manner that shocks the average citizens' sentiments; not to 
mention the tension and suspicion and doubt it creates within 
the military and security institution, the cohesion, solidarity, 
and unity of which is one of the guarantees of national unity, 
and is an aspect of security and tranquility among the people. 
  Fourth, violating the document of the government coalition 
and parliamentary coordination, which stipulates that 
cooperation must be demonstrated by the government members and 
agencies. A deliberate failure to attend meetings has been 
noticed. This has confused the government's performance, thus 
creating clear confusion in the daily administration of the 
state's executive body. 
  The GPC General Committee is aware, with a great sense of 
responsibility, of the difficult and complicated circumstances 
created by the crisis and warns against the dangers of what is 
taking place on the ground in terms of practices that could harm 
the results of the national dialogue and obstruct the 
implementational measures and executive programs. Indeed, they 
could pave the way for another crisis and serious repercussions 
of which only God Almighty knows the magnitude and destructive 
ramifications. 
  From this premise, the General Committee calls on all the 
unionist national forces to shoulder their high national 
responsibility to maintain the safety of our Yemeni homeland and 
our unionist democratic struggle against these practices which 
are harmful to our great unionist accomplishment and to the 
progress, growth, prosperity, security, and safety of our 
country. At the same time, it reaffirms the following: 
  First, the GPC's commitment to the results that are reached 
through national dialogue. 
  Second, demanding that the national dialogue expose the 
facts to the people and define every party's responsibility in 
the dialogue and its seriousness and determination to allow the 
country to reach the shores of safety, as well as its concern 
about social accord and peace. In due course, the general 
committee will reveal to the public a host of facts that deal 
with the background and developments of the crisis. 
  Third, any procrastination or prevarication about efforts 
to resolve the crisis will only create further serious 
repercussions that will jeopardize the survival of the homeland 
as well as the citizens' lives, particularly since such 
procrastination or prevarication would be accompanied by 
attempts to obstruct the functioning of constitutional 
institutions to show them as impotent and drive the homeland 
into the unknown. 
  Fourth, the General Committee condemns terrorist practices, 
kidnappings, and mysterious assassinations, as well as security 
violations, which are masterminded and used for political 
purposes. Furthermore, it demands that full investigations of 
these violations be conducted, and also that the circumstances 
surrounding them, as well as their poisoned purposes be made 
public. 
  While observing the serious deterioration in the citizens' 
daily lives, the GPC cannot allow itself to view the people's 
sufferings, their livelihood problems, as well as their daily 
pains and hard living conditions as food for rhetorical 
one-upmanship and media vituperations, or as a means for winning 
over the hearts and minds of people to promote partisan or 
political purposes. This is because the GPC is well aware that 
the people's feelings and views are their own property. Only 
the people know the reasons for the crisis, know who stands to 
benefit from it, and who stands to benefit from its 
continuation. Moreover, they are well aware of the GPC's bright 
and honorable record, which is replete with national, 
humanitarian, and social contributions. 
  The General Committee views the initiative of their eminence 
the ulema and the favorable response to it by Lieutenant General 
brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, secretary general of the GPC and 
chairman of the Presidential Council, by his agreement to attend 
their meeting at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in the Janad area in 
the Ta'izz Governorate as an indication of the importance he 
attaches to Arab and Islamic traditions. This move by the 
brother GPC secretary general was meant to defuse the crisis, 
put minds at ease, promote trust among unity orientated leaders, 
and launch steps to achieve national accord and agreement. It 
is also proof that the brother president and GPC secretary 
general has a great sense of responsibility. It is an 
expression of the GPC's sincere desire to take the lead in 
showing selflessness in order to safeguard our Yemeni homeland's 
higher interests, the people's choice, as well as their free 
will regarding unity and democracy. This move is also proof 
that he is willing to aid our people's efforts to walk the path 
of revival and construction. This move also shows his support 
for the sincere national efforts to safeguard the future of the 
homeland and citizens alike. 
  The General Committee also hails the initiatives launched by 
the Yemeni revolution strugglers, the Armed Forces commanders, 
as well as their sincere and honest contributions to spare the 
homeland fragmentation and collapse. The General Committee is 
extremely satisfied with the results shown by popular gatherings 
in the Republic's governorates, for they have shown an eagerness 
to safeguard national unity, and called for resolving crises 
through dialogue, which is a manifestation of civilized conduct. 
Besides, this is the only option for achieving progress in the 
country through broad popular participation, and also through 
the introduction of further practices, measures, and regulations 
that would recreate the administrative relationship between the 
state's central authorities and local administrations. This new 
relationship must produce the largest possible degree of 
participation in decisionmaking with regard to facilitating 
daily life in administrative units, as well as local development. 
  The GPC cannot but highly value these sincere national 
stands. As a matter of course, it finds itself on the side of 
these masses, supportive of their demands, and appreciative of 
their good initiatives. Meanwhile, it salutes them for their 
great concern to safeguard national unity and the democratic 
march. 
  Concluding its periodic meeting, the General Committee 
appreciated all the sincere national efforts made by political 
and social forces to cope with the crisis, as well as the Arab 
and international efforts, which showed an eagerness to 
safeguard the soundness of the unionist and democratic march in 
Yemen. For, this reflects Yemen's standing, as well as its 
importance for regional security and stability, not to mention 
its role in peace and development. This also reflects the 
desire of these parties to see Yemen involved in the efforts to 
build a new world order that would produce security, stability, 
and prosperity for it, and for the region at large. 
  And say: Work righteousness: Soon will God observe your 
work, and His Apostle and the believers." [Koranic verse] 
  Issued by the GPC's General Committee, Sanaa, on 11 January 
1994.

  [Text] The political forces' dialogue committee held a 
meeting at the Executive Committee's hall in the economic and 
commercial capital, Aden, this morning. The meeting is part of 
the committee's continued and intensive efforts to resolve the 
political crisis. The committee reached an agreement on a draft 
document of pledge and reconciliation among the parties to the 
political forces' dialogue to build the modern Yemeni state. 
Discussions will continue on some parties' views and 
reservations. The meetings were permeated by a good atmosphere 
reflecting a spirit of optimism and a sense of the historic 
responsibility toward the homeland under the difficult 
circumstances it is experiencing. The conferees showed 
eagerness to maintain and bolster our people's great 
achievements of unity and democracy and to tackle the current 
political crisis in a manner that ensures its nonrecurrence in 
the future. An emphasis has been placed on laying down the 
sound foundations for the building of a modern Yemeni state and 
its institutions and a stable system. 
  It is noteworthy that the basic issues in the draft document 
of pledge and reconciliation have been approved, pending a 
decision on some reservations and points that are still under 
consultation to [word indistinct] and sign the document in its 
final and formula. 
  The session was adjourned this afternoon to give the parties 
to the dialogue a chance for further consultations. They will 
meet again Saturday morning, 15 January. 
  An important statement was issued following the meetings of 
the political forces' dialogue committee. Following is the text 
of the statement: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. A 
statement to the nation's people issued by the political forces' 
dialogue committee on 13 January 1994: 
  Praise be to God Who says: And hold fast, all together, by 
the rope which Allah stretches out for you, and be not divided 
among yourselves [Koranic verse]. Peace and blessings be upon 
the master of all prophets, the messenger of love and guidance, 
who said: No believer shall be considered a believer until he 
loves for his brother what he loves for himself. 
  Our esteemed people: Our beloved country is experiencing a 
sharp political crisis which has threatened all the Yemenis' 
dreams for a unified, democratic, and developed society. Had it 
not been for the grace of God, the wisdom of the sons of Yemen, 
and the sincere sentiments of its brothers and friends, Yemen 
would have gone down a road which would have distressed its 
lovers and pleased its haters. Governed by the logic of reason 
and wisdom, the Yemenis have opted for dialogue and tolerance 
rather than stubbornness and blind fanaticism. They have also 
opted for avoiding rather than obeying destructive tendencies. 
All political forces went to the dialogue table after agreeing 
on adopting dialogue as the sole way to resolve the crisis and 
to settle differences. All parties have agreed to renounce all 
forms and means of violence. 
  The political forces' dialogue committee has started its 
work by setting up committees which will work to halt the media, 
security, and military repercussions. This is order to provide 
a calm atmosphere that is committed to a logical and serious 
dialogue. The political forces' dialogue committee has laid down 
the necessary measures to halt these repercussions. Despite the 
continuation of some repercussions and some parties' violation 
of the committee's past decisions, the political forces' 
dialogue committee has continued its work effectively. This is 
out of its concern for the supreme objectives and to pay no 
attention to trivialities. 
  Through its continued meetings in Sanaa and Aden, the 
polticial forces' dialogue committee reached a full agreement on 
most issues raised for dialogue. They dealt with the essential 
causes of the frequent political crises and the need for radical 
solutions to ensure that they do not reoccur. The political 
forces' dialogue committee has placed on the table all views, 
papers, and proposals that have been raised by political forces 
from inside and outside the authority. The dialogue committee 
has received important documents on the foundations of the 
building of the modern Yemeni state, the state of law and order 
and institutions, a state that is based on justice, equality, 
freedom, democracy, and decentralization of the local government 
system. Such principles are based on the Islamic faith and law 
and respect for human rights. 
  The political forces' dialogue committee had been eager to 
accomplish its work within a period not to go beyond 10 January 
1994. However, in view of the nature of the dialogue, and out 
of their concern about reaching a complete agreement, the 
political forces have decided that more time is needed before 
such an agreement is reached. It has set 18 January as a final 
date for the political forces' dialogue committee to finish the 
document of pledge and reconciliation, to set a mechanism and a 
timetable for its implementation, and to agree in principle on 
the place and date of the ceremonies of singing the document. 
  The political forces' dialogue committee stressed that the 
document is an advanced and important step. However, the 
implementation of its contents is the most important step that 
is being impatiently awaited by our people. In view of the 
importance of following up and monitoring the steps of 
implementation, the political forces dialogue committee must 
continue to exist as a popular committee to follow up the steps 
of implementation and to monitor the abidance of the parties to 
the coalition by the timetable of implementation. The committee 
should keep the masses apprised of the progress of 
implementation and should specify the stands of all parties on 
it without equivocation, concealment, or deception. 
  Pledging before God and the people to be sincere in its 
proposals and faithful in its actions, the political forces' 
committee asks the parties that have some reservations to put 
them aside in the interest of the homeland. It also asks all 
parties to avoid anything that would spoil the climate of the 
dialogue and exacerbate the situation. They should abide by all 
the measures that the committee has approved and vowed before 
the people to respect. Whoever disowns his pledge, violates his 
commitments, or drags Yemen down a road that neither satisfies 
God nor the people--be it through verbal abuses, violations, or 
failure to implement what has been committed to--will be held 
responsible before history and the people. God testifies to our 
sincere intentions.

  [Text] Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant General 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih met at the Presidential Palace in Ta'izz 
today with the brother representatives of the Hajjah 
Governorates' gathering which includes political parties and 
organizations, shaykhs, ulema, dignitaries, youths, and trade 
unions. 
  The president addressed the audience and welcomed the 
representatives of the Hajjah gathering and expressed 
appreciation for their national sentiments and response to the 
events taking place in the homeland, and the current crisis. He 
also expressed appreciation for their concern about the great 
achievement, unity. He said: Your arrival in Ta'izz today 
confirms your faithfulness to unity and democracy. This is not 
strange for the struggler sons of Hajjah, who had the honor to 
defend the revolution and the republic, and who were among the 
vanguards who struggled for the sake of unity. Today, they are 
leading this march to meet with their brothers in the rest of 
the governorates in order to tell the truth and charge the 
leadership with the responsibility of safeguarding unity. 
  The brother president added: We bless all that you have 
reached in terms of resolutions and recommendations. We promise 
you that we will be as you think well of us. We will not go 
back on your demands which are in harmony with all the demands 
of the Republic's governorates; Hadramawt, Ta'izz, Ibb, 
al-Mahwit, and al-Hudaydah. Such gatherings are also being held 
in all the Republic's governorates. 
  The brother president said: For the sake of the higher 
national interests, I call for holding a conference to safeguard 
unity and democracy, to include the leaderships of all these 
gatherings in the Republic's governorates, whether those that 
have already been held or those which will be held. The 
president highly appreciated the ulema gathering which was 
concluded at the Mu'adh Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad area in 
Ta'izz today. He said: We hoped for our colleagues' response 
in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], headed by 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, to the call made by the ulema in Yemen to meet and to 
give predominance to Yemen's interests over any other parochial 
party and personal interests. He said: We are fully aware of 
the people's suffering. We will not be like the ostrich which 
buries its head in the sand. We will spare no effort to make 
all the concessions that are dictated by the homeland's greater 
interests in order to safeguard unity. I hope that the 
conference I am calling to be held for the leaderships of the 
expanded gatherings in the Republic's governorates will mark the 
beginning of a peaceful national march from Ta'izz to the 
economic and commercial capital, Aden, and to be called the 
march of peace, security, stability, and Yemeni unity. Unity is 
for all the masses of the people. It is for all the honest 
people of farmers, peasants, intellectuals, politicians, and 
every citizen. It is not for one person or a group of persons 
in the Presidential Council. 
  The brother president addressed the conferees, saying: You 
will find all of us within the political leadership speaking 
frankly and clearly on all national issues, be they issues that 
emerged before the inception of unity, during the transitional 
period, or during the regrettable crisis experienced by the 
homeland for the past five months--the worst crisis experienced 
by the homeland since the start of the fragmentation period. 
For, it never dawned upon us that national unity could 
experience such a fragmentation, or that such erroneous 
propaganda campaigns could be directed at the masses. 
  The conferees have issued a statement, affirming that the 
Yemeni individual is the most precious asset. Hence, the 
legitimacy of any regime is contingent upon its ability to 
provide the population with a decent living and with the 
components of such a living; upon its ability to care for them; 
upon its ability to provide them with security, justice, and a 
prosperous life; and also upon its ability to treat them as 
equals without any discrimination. Within this context, the 
conferees urge all competent state organs to perform their basic 
duties, particularly the following: 
  --Hastening the efforts to rid the homeland of the stifling 
political and economic crisis plaguing it, which has left 
adverse repercussions affecting citizens' lives. 
  --Hastening the referral of all defendants charged with 
assassinations, explosions, and all other criminal acts of 
violence, sabotage, plunder, riots, thefts, and kidnappings, 
regardless of the motives, to public trials, and exposing 
culprits, as well as their masterminds. 
  --Achieving the independence of the judiciary, and cleansing 
judicial authorities and the Public Prosecution of the negative 
aspects which could undermine their competence, such as bribery, 
favoritism, negligence, and procrastination. These organs must 
be reorganized and rehabilitated. 
  --Taking firm measures to remove all objectionable 
manifestations and corruption at government organs, as well as 
public and mixed sector organizations. 
  The statement urged the House of Representatives to carry 
out 
its monitoring prerogatives on the executive authority, be they 
the Presidential Council or the Council of Ministers. 
  The conferees commended the role of the Yemeni Armed Forces, 
and urged them to always remain the homeland's protective shield 
and a symbol of national unity. It recommended that they be 
rebuilt and rehabilitated, and that they be redirected so they 
may occupy their proper positions outside cities and major 
residential neighborhoods, and so they may play their role in 
defending the homeland, its independence, and its territorial 
integrity. The conferees condemned the use of firearms, 
violence, intimidation, and acts of sabotage to resolve 
disputes; settle intellectual, political, social, or personal 
differences; or achieve a unilateral control of authority. The 
conferees warned all individuals, parties, and factions, 
regardless of whether or not they are members of the coalition 
government, against the consequences of any attempt to secure 
such a unilateral control of authority. The conferees also 
warned them against any efforts to tamper with the people's 
gains and resources.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Yemeni ulema, who "concluded their </F>
meetings at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad area in 
the Ta'izz Governorate today" in Ta'izz on 13 January--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Because the ulema are aware of 
the religious duty God has asked them to perform toward their 
people and nation to help them cope with the dangers and 
hardships and effect a reconciliation, the Yemeni ulema examined 
the political crisis being experienced by the homeland during 
the meeting they held in Sanaa on 7-10 Rajab 1414 Hegira [21-24 
December 1993] to address the political crisis and its 
implications and analyze its reasons, as well as the course of 
action that needs to be taken to resolve it. They issued a 
statement, inviting brother Presidential Council Chairman 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Presidential Council 
Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid to a meeting at the Mu'ad 
Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad area on 27 Rajab 1414 Hejira 
[10 January 1994], because they were convinced that the meeting 
between the brother president and the brother vice president is 
the first step toward a reconciliation, which would help heal 
the rift and rid us of the crisis. 
  Because the ulema were concerned about the success of the 
meeting, they dispatched delegations to the brother president 
and the brother vice president, inviting them to the meeting, 
and asking them to be on time. That is why the ulema met at the 
al-Janad Mosque on 27 Rajab 1414 Hejira. The meeting continued 
until 30 Rajab 1414 Hejira [13 January], because they were eager 
to safeguard unity, contain the crisis, and identify the 
solutions that would spare the people calamities, to relieve 
them of the sufferings they are experiencing, and to thwart the 
efforts of Yemen's enemies to fragment it, undermine its unity, 
and push it into the abyss of the conflict that would confuse 
the population and the country. 
  Presidential Council Chairman brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 
'Abdallah 
Salih showed up at the agreed upon mosque on schedule. He 
informed the ulema of the reasons and ramifications of the 
crisis as he sees them. He also informed them that he is 
willing to accept the solutions the ulema deem fit. The ulema 
regret the failure of Presidential Council Vice Chairman 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid to show up on schedule. And because the ulema were 
concerned about his participation in the meeting, they remained 
in touch with the competent agencies to remind him that the 
ulema were continuing to wait for his attendance. They 
continued to await his attendance until the time this statement 
was issued. 
  The ulema hold the brother Presidential Council vice 
chairman 
responsible for the consequences of his failure to attend, for 
his failure to respond to the ulema's letter, and for his 
failure to receive the delegation they sent from the al-Janad 
area. This is regrettable, particularly since the people are 
being crushed by the crisis, the hellish price hikes, and the 
decline in the exchange rate of the national currency. 
  The ulema continued their meetings in accordance with the 
itinerary of their meetings. During these meetings, they 
addressed the crisis and its repercussions, as well as the 
security violations and the stifling economic crisis it created. 
Hence, and inspired by the teachings of our true Islamic 
religion, which is the nation's creed, its sharia, and its way 
of life, the ulema underscore adherence to the following 
constants: 
  First, adherence to Yemeni unity as a religious duty and 
national necessity that must be safeguarded and defended. It 
must not be abandoned. [passage omitted] 
  Second, adherence to constitutional and legal legitimacy in 
all that does not violate the Holy Koran and the prophet's 
traditions. There should be no efforts to circumvent it or act 
against its institutions. 
  Third, the Holy Koran and the traditions of Prophet 
Muhammad, 
may God's peace be upon him, must be used as arbiters in all 
disputes and conflicts. [passage omitted] 
  Proposed solutions: Based on all that has been mentioned, 
and after a study of the manifestations, reasons, and 
repercussions of the crisis, the ulema view the following as 
solutions to the crisis: 
  First, the return to Sanaa by Presidential Council Vice 
Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid in response to the appeal of the 
House of Representatives so that he may perform his 
constitutional duties. For, this is the first step toward a 
resolution of the current crisis. 
  Second, ending the manifestations of fragmentation at all 
government and popular facilities, and merging the armies, 
currencies, and aviation corporations, as well as all economic 
institutions. 
  Third, halting the media and military escalation and 
returning the camps to where they were before the eruption of 
the crisis. 
  The Yemeni ulema urge all Armed Forces and Public Security 
personnel to observe neutrality in the dispute between the two 
parties to the crisis, and to place Yemeni interests above all 
partisan and personal interests. 
  Fourth, fighting all kinds of corruption and the corrupt, 
wherever they may be, as well as their supporters, and not 
allowing any solutions outside the context of legitimate 
institutions. 
  Fifth, the efforts made by the House of Representatives, the 
Yemeni ulema, and domestic and external mediators to contain the 
ongoing crisis and effect a reconciliation between the two 
parties to the crisis have failed. There has been a daily 
escalation in this crisis. Hence, the ulema urge the 
influential people in the country to convene a general Yemeni 
congress in which Yemenis of all governorates and sectors will 
be represented. In this congress, the people must be able to 
decide their future. The conferees have entrusted His Eminence 
Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 'Aziz al-Zandani and the religious scholar 
Judge Muhammad Bin-Isma'il al-Hajji with the task of forming a 
preparatory committee for the congress. They have also asked 
them to set a date and a venue for the congress. 
  Sixth, the Yemeni ulema meeting at the al-Janad area have 
asked the Higher Committee which prepared their meeting to 
follow up on the implementation of their decisions, and to 
inform them of new developments. 
  Seventh, the Yemeni ulema urge that the public be made aware 
of the dangers posed to their unity, security, and stability. 
  Concluding, the Yemeni ulema appeal to all Yemenis to 
demonstrate vigilance and awareness, and not to allow themselves 
to be dragged behind the rumors and lies promoted by domestic 
and foreign media, and to act upon the words of Almighty God: O 
Ye who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with any news, 
ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and 
afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have done. 
[passage omitted] 
  Issued at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad area on 
30 Rajab 1414 Hejira, corresponding to 13 January 1994

  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, Jan 13 (AFP) -- The Iraqi army has 
pulled back from Kurdish lines in northern Iraq along a stretch 
of 20-30 kilometres (12-24 miles), Kurdish defence officials 
said Thursday. 
  They told AFP that the withdrawal from the Makhmur region 
near the main Kurdish town of Irbil took place on Wednesday, 
with the army pulling back four kilometres (two miles). 
  There was no immediate explanation for the pull-back in 
Makhmur, where the Iraqi army shelled farms during the harvest 
last summer. 
  The region is close to the 36th parallel, north of which the 
Gulf war allies have imposed a no-fly zone for Iraqi aircraft. 
The declared aim of the zone is to protect the Kurds, who 
control northern Iraq in defiance of Baghdad. 
  Kurdish military officials also said that Turkish gunners 
shelled the border regions of Narwah and Rikan, without causing 
damage or casualties. Turkish troops were concentrated on the 
other side of the border. 
  In Ankara, the ANATOLIA news agency reported Wednesday that 
Turkish army commando units had crossed into northern Iraq in 
pursuit of Kurdish rebels who attacked a police post in 
southeast Turkey killing two officers. 
  Thirteen rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) were 
also killed during the attack Tuesday evening in Cukurca, near 
the Turkish border with Iran and Iraq. 
  It said the commando unit had crossed at least five 
kilometres (three miles) into Iraq on Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, leader of the </F>
Islamic Movement of Kurdistan, by unidentified reporters; in 
Salah-al-Din; date not given] 
  [Text] While Turkey was exerting intensive efforts in the 
international political forum [NATO meeting] for the 
clarification of the status of northern Iraq, a new force 
silently emerged in the region. It is the Islamic Front, and 
its leader is Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz. Our colleague 
Kursat Akyol met Shaykh 'Uthman in Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq. 
  [Begin recording] [First off-screen reporter] The Islamic 
Front made itself known for the first time last month. 
Following a 10-day-long bloody battle with Talabani's 
peshmergas, the organization withdrew and its leader Shaykh 
'Uthman fell prisoner. One immediately notices the extraordinary 
security measures at the entrance of the house where he lives 
under the custody of the Kurdish leader Barzani. During the 
meeting with the shaykh, prominent members of his party were 
also present. What was the aim of this radical Islamic group 
that was born so quietly? 
  [Second off-screen reporter, translating the statement of 
Shaykh 'Uthman, who is on screen but unheard] Our aim is to 
establish an Islamic state in northern Iraq similar to the one 
in Iran; an independent Kurdish state governed in accordance 
with the shari'ah, and then to expand this state toward the 
north, that is, toward Turkey. Once we take the Kurds in Turkey 
into an independent Kurdistan we will establish a great Islamic 
state. 
  [First off-screen reporter] With what force does Shaykh 
'Uthman intend to accomplish this? Where is his military power? 
  [Second off-screen reporter, translating 'Uthman] I cannot 
reply to this question, as it is a military secret. We have 
peshmergas in every corner of Kurdistan. We have 12,000 
peshmergas only in the mountains. 
  [First off-screen reporter] Shaykh 'Uthman has interesting 
links in Turkey. He told us that he visited Turkey 10 months 
ago, and held quite beneficial talks during this second visit. 
  [Second off-screen reporter, translating 'Uthman] We met 
with 
the leading officials of the Welfare Party, with Necmettin 
Erbakan and Sevket Kazan. We also held beneficial and fraternal 
talks with the leaders of Nur Society. [video shows guards in

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH and AL-JUMHURIYAH in 
Arabic in their 8 January issues carry articles calling for 
resuming transmission of the Voice of Youth Radio and Youth 
Television, reportedly owned by Saddam Husayn's son, 'Udayy. 
  Baghdad AL-THAWRAH, on page 8, carries a 250-word unsigned 
article headlined "In Light of the Discontinuation of the Youth 
Radio and Television; the Need To Resume Transmission" 
emphasizing "that the Youth Television Channel and the Voice of 
Youth Radio have been well received by the various sectors of 
the people in view of their effective and developed performance 
and their serious presentation." 
  The paper adds: "For these reasons, we believe it is 
necessary to review the question of the discontinuation of the 
Voice of Youth Radio and the Youth Television because this 
discontinuation is an irreplaceable loss under these 
circumstances where our militant country experiences the most 
ferocious conspiracies in which the enemy forces use all means, 
including war propaganda, which we must face with new methods." 
The article further says: "We hope that these two stations will 
resume transmission so that they may perform the role required 
of them." 
  Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH, also on page 8, carries a 300-word 
article by Ahmad Hatif on the same topic. The article says 
"Suddenly, the Youth Radio and Television transmitters stopped 
working, and thousands of the fans of this youthful voice waited 
for a clear reply to a difficult question, and we received many 
phone calls asking about the secret and seeking a reply that we 
do not have about the interruption of a long-awaited dream." 
The article goes on to say "We believe that in the interest of 
Iraqi media, the media of the Mother of Battles, this honest 
voice should resume transmission as soon as possible. If some 
say that technical and operational mistakes accompanied this 
mistake, this does not mean that this experiment should be 
ignored. Mistakes should be corrected, initiatives encouragerd, 
new plans should be formulated, and life reinfused in this 
unique experiment." 
  Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network in Arabic at 1514 GMT 
on 10 January carried an announcement filed as referent item 
that: "The youth radio and television have resumed their 
transmission as of 1800 [1500 GMT] this evening." The radio 
does not give any reason for the interruption.

<F P=106> [Report by Nehama Dowek] </F>
  [Excerpt] "In the future, no agreement will be reached 
without a direct dialogue between the leaders of the Arab states 
and the prime minister of the State of Israel. This also 
applies to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. This is my 
conclusion from the peace process following the Declaration of 
Principles with the PLO." 
  These remarks were made last night by Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin when he emerged from the Labor Central Committee session 
summoned to discuss the results of the Histadrut labor 
federation elections and the agenda for the party convention 
scheduled for the end of the month. 
  Asked whether he had relayed a message to al-Asad via 
Clinton, Rabin replied: "And if I did, would I publicize it in 
the media? In any event, I did not relay any message 
whatsoever." He said he is confident the Clinton-al-Asad summit 
will lead to the resumption of the negotiations with the Syrians 
and the other countries in Washington toward the end of this 
month. 
  Referring to the negotiations with the PLO, the prime 
minister said: "Senior officials sit down and reach agreements, 
and then one of them says that it was not so and that he is the 
boss. Then you say to yourself: We sat in Oslo, Paris, and 
Cairo, and now in Taba, and I still do not know for certain that 
the matter is finished. If there is a lesson to be drawn from 
the negotiations with the Palestinians, it is that no agreement 
should be reached in the future without a thorough dialogue 
between the leaders of the bodies involved in the negotiations."

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin believes it was 
a mistake from the outset to build settlements in all the places 
where they were established, including the Golan Heights. At 
the same time, he says, the settlements cannot be scraped off 
the face of the earth retroactively. Interviewed on Qol 
Yisra'el, Beilin said most of the settlements will not remain 
under Israeli rule under the permanent arrangement and that, 
consequently, an agreement should be reached with the 
Palestinians and the Syrians whereby Israelis will be allowed to 
remain in their settlements under Arab rule. 
  The Golan Heights Settlements Committee is demanding that 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin clarify whether Beilin's remarks 
reflect the government's policy and, if they do not, to fire 
Yosi Beilin. 
  Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that Hanan 
Erez, chairman of MAPAM [United Workers Party], has also 
criticized Deputy Minister Beilin. Erez believes that such 
pronouncements, coming on the eve of the Clinton-al-Asad summit, 
are unnecessary and damaging both politically and in terms of 
their impact on the mood of the Golan settlers.

  [Text] A public opinion poll conducted among Golan 
settlers by Haifa University's Statistics Department and 
commissioned by Qol Yisra'el shows that 12 percent of them would 
be prepared to leave the area now in exchange for appropriate 
compensation. About one-third of this group described sums 
ranging from $100,000 to $300,000 as appropriate compensation. 
The poll also reveals that about 6 percent of them have looked 
into possibilities of leaving, such as jobs and housing. Our 
correspondent Shula Schmerling reports that the telephone poll 
was conducted among approximately 300 Golan settlers.

  [Text] The tragedy which befell the Army [reference to 12 
January Army helicopter crash in which four senior officers were 
killed] postponed by three days the licensed demonstration which 
Golan settlers planned to hold in front of the U.S. Embassy in 
Tel Aviv. However, today they did present the embassy with a 
letter written on behalf of the settlers, which urged the United 
States to avoid pressuring Israel on the negotiations with 
Syria. The U.S. Embassy's First Secretary Kyle Scott warmly 
welcomed the visitors in the embassy lobby. He promised that 
the letter would be faxed to Geneva, as well as Washington. He 
said the United States will do all it can to help Israel and 
Syria reach joint solutions. 
  The delegation members were satisfied. Here is what Sammy 
Bar-Lev, the Qatzrin local council head, said: 
  [Begin Bar-Lev recording] He reiterated several times the 
U.S. stand that the United States is not pressuring the State of 
Israel on the Golan matter, that it views it as a matter for 
Israeli-Syrian negotiations, which it is ready to assist. It 
will definitely not intervene or pressure. This is a very 
strong message to all kinds of commentators and advisers and 
politicians, who predicted that we will be unable to stand up to 
U.S. pressure. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Al-Asad-Clinton Geneva Summit"] </F>
  [Text] All eyes are nowadays focused on Geneva, where 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton will meet in a summit 
the day after tomorrow, Sunday [16 January]. Observers pin 
great hopes on this meeting, which they expect will produce 
positive results that would push forward the peace process. 
Such a meeting should be held and the United States should 
throw its full weight behind continuation of the peace process, 
especially after the Israeli rulers have displayed intentions 
which show they are not interested in a genuine peace, but in 
wasting time, avoiding the resolutions of international 
legitimacy, and avoiding compliance with the letters on the 
basis of which the Madrid conference was launched. 
  Given this situation, Syria has understood the facts and 
knows for certain that Israel is maneuvering and seeking 
separate deals with this or that Arab party. Israel has also 
continued to exercise the ugliest forms of suppression, 
terrorism, and murder. Israel has continued to confiscate Arab 
lands and build new settlements without any regard for the peace 
process or the talks that are being held in more than one 
capital and with total disregard for the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and human rights charters. 
  Thus, the Syrian position came clear and firm. In a 
nutshell, it is that there can be no peace without an Israeli 
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories; that there can be 
no peace but the just comprehensive peace that would restore the 
Palestinian Arab people's national legitimate rights; that there 
can be no peace without regaining the Arab lands in Syria, 
Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine; and that any attempt by the 
Israeli rulers to avoid these principles and facts will be 
rejected. 
  Therefore, the peoples of the region who yearn for the just 
and comprehensive peace are pinning hopes on the Presidents 
al-Asad-Clinton meeting. This is because peace cannot be 
achieved without Syria and the region will not see peace or 
stability unless all the Arab parties are involved in the 
current peace process and on the basis of UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and the land-for-peace formula. 
  Finally, the Presidents al-Asad-Clinton meeting confirms the 
important position of Damascus in the region and its principal 
role, which cannot be ignored or avoided, neither in peace nor 
in war.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown on 
Wednesday [12 January] described his visit to the Middle East 
next week as the best indication yet of Washington's commitment 
to regional economic development as part of the Arab-Israeli 
peace process. 
  Mr. Brown, who is due in Amman on Monday after visiting 
Saudi 
Arabia, noted that he would be accompanied by representatives of 
American businessmen and said one of the objectives of his trip 
was to identify areas where the U.S. private sector could be 
encouraged to interact with its counterparts in the countries of 
the region. 
  Parallel to that goal, Mr. Brown said, he would also be 
"very 
aggressively" pursuing the U.S. quest to have the Arab boycott 
of Israel lifted. 
  "I have raised (this issue) with every meeting I had" with 
the concerned governments, he said, noting that he was scheduled 
to meet with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) ministers in Riyadh 
on Sunday. 
  "The U.S. is going to continue to push to eliminate all 
boycotts and I am going to press it with all the leaders with 
(whom) I meet, as I have done before, and as President Clinton 
has done," he said. 
  Answering questions from businessmen and journalists from 
Amman, Cairo, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in a satellite interview 
from Washington, Mr. Brown declined to be specific on most 
issues, saying that all options were under consideration during 
his visit. 
  The American official agreed that the continuing de facto 
blockade of the port of al-'Aqabah as part of the enforcement of 
the U.N. sanctions against Iraq was contrary to the new-found 
spirit of free international trade without any barriers. 
  But he did not indicate when Washington, through its 
influence in the U.N. Security Council, would be moving to 
address Jordanian grievances over the high cost the Kingdom's 
importers and exporters have to pay for shipping to and from 
al-'Aqabah as a result of the costly delays posed by the 
inspection. 
  Mr. Brown did promise, however, that he would study a report 
prepared by Jordanian businessmen and handed over to a U.S. 
fact- finding mission in September. 
  He appeared to suggest that the sanctions on Iraq were 
somehow directly linked to the overall Middle East peace process 
by suggesting that once a regional peace settlement is achieved 
the Jordanian concerns could be addressed. 
  "Vestiges of past tension have to be removed,' he said. "We 
hope to move as quickly as possible to that date..." 
  The commerce secretary also agreed that there had to be a 
better "equilibrium" in trade between the U.S. and Jordan, but 
did not spell out whether the administration was planning 
specific action wherever it could help increase American imports 
from Jordan. 
  According to Dr. Thabit al-Tahir, a former minister and a 
current member of the Jordan Businessmen's Association (JBA) who 
was one of Wednesday's questioners, Jordanian imports from the 
U.N. totalled $301 million in the first 10 months of 1993, while 
American imports of Jordanian products remained under $4 million. 
  Mr. Brown acknowledged that one of his objectives during the 
visit was to increase U.S. exports to the region. "I also 
understand that a commercial relationship is a two-way 
street...there has to be an equilibrium...and that is what we 
are trying to create." 
  Mr. Brown said Washington was "committed to the economic 
development" of the Middle East so that people can feel peace 
has brought changes" to their standards of living. 
  His visit to the Middle East at "this crucial" point in time 
in the peace process, Mr. Brown said, is intended to be a signal 
of this commitment. 
  "I think that is why this mission is so important," he 
added. 
"With the coming of peace people's expectations are high in all 
the countries involved in the region. People believe that their 
lives are going to change ..." 
  According to Mr. Brown, economic development and cooperation 
in the region meant increased job opportunities as one of the 
most tangible results of the peace process for the ordinary 
citizen. 
  The U.S. official said he and the businessmen accompanying 
him were looking forward to "creative kinds of proposals" from 
their interlocutors in the region. 
  He described the level of American investment in the Middle 
East as very low and attributed it to a sense of lack of 
stability and security and said Washington wanted to find out 
"whether we can increase the comfort level ... the confidence 
level" of businessmen in investing in the region. 
  "We are going to establish direct contacts between American 
businessmen and Jordanian, Palestinian, Israeli and Saudi 
businessmen," he said. 
  In the context of the American role in Palestinian economic 
development, Mr. Brown specifically referred to a group of 
Jewish American and Arab American businessmen under the umbrella 
of a new group, "Builders for Peace," and said Washington would 
be closely coordinating with the group in terms of encouraging 
American businesses to invest. 
  "Builders for peace" was set up under a 
Washington-encouraged 
initiative undertaken by former senator James Abourisk and 
former congressman Mel Devine. it groups many Arab-American as 
well as Jewish-American businessmen who have shown keen interest 
in investing in the occupied territories. 
  Infrastructure for the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories is an area where immediate opportunities exist for 
potential investors, he said. 
  "There is very little on that agenda (Palestinian economic 
development) that we are not talking about now," Mr. Brown told 
a Palestinian questioner from Jerusalem. 
  "The United States has to put a stake in the ground," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Jordan Confirms Continuation of Its </F>
Efforts in Yemen and Denies Sending Troops With Bin-Shakir"] 
  [Text] Amman, Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A high-ranking 
Jordanian source yesterday reaffirmed his country's interest in 
continuing its efforts to resolve the current crisis in Yemen 
resulting from continuing differences between Yemeni President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. In 
Cairo, the Arab League confirmed that it intends to send an 
envoy to Yemen as part of its efforts to contain the 
deteriorating situation there. 
  In Amman, the source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Jordan will 
not refrain from continuing its mediation efforts between the 
Yemeni leaders despite the failure of the Jordanian efforts to 
promote a reconciliation so far. 
  He added that consultations are under way between al-Sharif 
Zayd Bin-Shakir, Jordanian chief of the Royal Court, and members 
of the Yemeni leadership to make arrangements for a visit King 
Husayn of Jordan intends to make early next month to Sanaa and 
Aden to eliminate existing differences between the Yemeni 
president and his deputy and to bridge their views to ensure 
survival of the unity of the two parts of Yemen. 
  He stressed that the Jordanian leadership was saddened by 
the 
failure of the efforts to bring about a reconciliation meeting 
between the Yemeni president and his deputy in Ta'izz last 
Sunday. He confirmed that Bin-Shakir's visit to Sanaa and Aden 
on Monday was made in the context of the Jordanian mediation, 
sponsored by King Husayn, for the reconciliation of the 
officials of the two parts of Yemen. 
  During that visit, the source said, Bin-Shakir met with 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and conveyed to him a message 
from King Husayn expressing Jordan's willingness to provide 
every possible assistance requested by the Yemeni leaders to 
ensure continuation of Yemeni unity. The meeting was attended 
by Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid 
Abu-Shawarib and Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah. 
Bin-Shakir also visited Aden and met with Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid in the presence of a number of Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] leaders in south Yemen. 
  The source added that the meeting between Bin-Shakir and 
al-Bid dealt with ways of easing the tension between the Yemeni 
leaders and then working for a reconciliation meeting between 
the Yemeni president and vice president, but al-Bid has so far 
not given a full answer as to whether or not he would attend a 
reconciliation meeting with Salih in the presence of King Husayn 
in an area halfway between Sanaa and Aden early next month. 
  The same Jordanian source denied reports of the dispatch of 
Jordanian forces to Yemen, describing them as inaccurate. He 
said that the Yemeni leadership had asked the Jordanian Army 
General Command to help it in providing expertise and advice 
regarding a plan the Yemeni leadership intends to implement with 
the aim of reorganizing the Yemeni Army units. He said that, on 
Monday's visit to Yemen, the Jordanian chief of the Royal Court 
was accompanied by Staff Major General 'Id Kamil al-Rawdan, 
Jordanian Army assistant chief of staff for operations and 
training. He added that during the visit Maj. Gen. al-Rawdan 
met with senior Yemeni Army officers and discussed with them the 
possibility of the Jordanian Army command contributing to the 
preparation and implementation of future plans for the 
reorganization of the Yemeni Army, and it was agreed to send a 
limited number of Jordanian officers to participate in the 
preparation of a new plan for that purpose. 
  In conclusion and in reply to a question, the Jordanian 
source said that Jordan is primarily interested in the 
continuation of security and stability in fraternal Yemen and in 
finding a solution to the current Yemeni crisis through dialogue 
and positive understanding between the Yemeni leaders. 
  In Cairo, informed sources at the Arab League Secretariat 
have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Arab League is holding 
consultations with the Arab states on the situation in Yemen, 
prevention of its partition, and preservation of its people's 
unity. They added that the Arab League secretary general has 
sent messages on this matter to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in the context of the 
endeavors to contain events there. 
  They also said that the Arab League is considering several 
options regarding the situation in Yemen with a view to putting 
an end to conflict and to the disputes between Salih and al-Bid, 
the two leaders in power. The Arab League had issued a 
statement expressing concern about the deteriorating situation 
in fraternal Yemen.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Peace and Balanced Development"] </F>
  [Text] In his valuable speech at the opening of the 
conference on the economies of peace in the Middle East, which 
opened in London recently, His Highness Crown Prince Hasan 
stressed that if the recent peace arrangements are to succeed, 
the disparities and distortions created by the conflict in the 
region must be eliminated, particularly the disparity between 
the Israeli economy and the economies of the other parties to 
the conflict. 
  An approach similar to the GATT-EU approach could be the 
best 
way to deal with the economic legacies of the conflict. The 
expected partnership requires a balanced economic growth which 
means that the excessive disparities in income levels between 
potential partners in the region must be reduced. This can be 
achieved, at some stage, by freedom of movement for goods, 
services, capital and labor. In the end, peace is not in the 
hands of governments, but of individuals, and unless peace can 
be made attractive to the man on the street, the best efforts of 
those seeking to achieve peace will be fruitless, leading to the 
conclusion that the gradual achievement of peace for peoples who 
have suffered for a long time from the calamities of the 
conflict will not be possible. 
  Such a thorough and clear view by His Highness Prince Hasan 
is principally based on the experience of Jordan, which is the 
nearest to the core of the conflict, and which shouldered an 
enormous human load. Jordan has given shelter to three waves of 
displaced Palestinians and endured a vast demographic strain and 
an approximately $7 billion in debts. 
  Thus, the reconstruction of the Middle East could proceed 
apace, especially if this region is allowed to play a more 
creative role within the context of the world economy. The 
climate of conflict, which has been going on for a long time, 
has forced the diversion of efforts away from development to 
finance the military confrontations. We hope the approaching 
age of peace will mark the end of, and the last chapter in that 
conflict.

  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi has said that bombings, 
like sectarian feuds, are Israeli acts. These attempts against 
Lebanon's unity, he added, will keep happening but security 
forces are prepared to foil them. 
  Dean of editors' Milhim Karam, who visited the president 
with 
a delegation from the Editors Union, reported that the president 
said that President Hafiz al-Asad is going to Geneva to defend 
not only issues concerning Syria and the Golan but also Lebanese 
issues. This summit has been well prepared and will therefore 
achieve positive results, he noted. 
  On municipal elections, the president hoped that elections 
will be held for the posts of village heads and mayors because 
municipalities have not had adequate representation. 
  The president emphasized that the Constitution is not a 
bible 
or divine and that it can be amended because it is man-made, 
negotiable, and subject to change. He noted that this 
Constitution did great injustice to the presidency because it 
weakened Article 58, which deals with urgent decrees; made the 
dissolution of the cabinet impossible; and annulled presidential 
authority on the cabinet. 
  The president reiterated his pledge to respect freedoms. He 
said that the media have a role in educating the public and 
saving them from perversion, which requires correspondents to 
tell the people all the facts. 
  On the cabinet debates, the president said: I agree with you 
that the cabinet sessions, resolutions, and agenda are not 
secret, but it is not wise to publicize every issue discussed by 
the cabinet.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Musawi: Results of Geneva Summit </F>
Will Be in Our Nation's Interests, Thanks to Syria"] 
  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Husayn al-Musawi, leader of the 
Islamic Amal Movement, said in his weekly seminar yesterday that 
"with its limitless support for the Israeli entity, the United 
States is taking serious steps on the road of the protocols of 
the elders of Zion." 
  However, he announced that "for our part, we will continue 
to 
fight the occupying invaders under the leadership of our 
guardian 'Ali Khamene'i." 
  He rejected "any settlement that leads to a peace with the 
enemy at the expense of our religion, holy places, and land, as 
we cannot relinquish our pride." 
  He added: "We will fight with all available means the 
microbe 
that has penetrated our body. We reject settlement, which 
abolishes the identity of our Palestinian kinfolk and their 
right of return." 
  He said that "the blood of our martyrs, the sacrifices of 
the 
young men of the Islamic resistance, and our kinfolk's 
steadfastness in Jabal 'Amil and west al-Biqa' and our unity 
will enable us to keep the jihad banner high and will help 
President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva to confront the leader of 
world arrogance (U.S. President Bill) Clinton." 
  Concluding, he said "we have no doubt at all that the 
results 
(of the Geneva summit) will be in the interests of our glorious 
nation, because Syria has proved its real commitment to 
liberating all our usurped land as well as its complete care for 
the mujahidin defending our territory and scared land."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Leader Iddih Hopes Clinton-al-Asad </F>
Meeting Would Produce a Solution for Lebanon"] 
  [Text] Paris, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Lebanese National Bloc 
leader Raymond Iddih yesterday wondered: "Will the 
Clinton-al-Asad meeting produce the solution"...for Lebanon? 
The Lebanese opposition leader living in France believes that 
Lebanon should be "the last Arab state to sign a peace agreement 
with Israel." 
  On the occasion of the upcoming U.S.-Syrian summit between 
Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva, Iddih made 
a statement in which he reviewed Lebanon's contemporary history 
and realities. He said that on 22 November 1943 Lebanon got its 
independence, its democratic parliamentary system, its political 
and economic liberal system, its freedom of the press, and its 
Islamic-Christian coexistence. These qualities upset and are 
still upsetting some parties, especially Israel since 1948. He 
added: Israel covets southern Lebanon up to al-Litani river 
because it wants to exploit the river's water. 
  On 15 March 1978 Israel suddenly invaded Lebanon up to 
al-Litani without any acceptable justification. On 19 March the 
UN Security Council passed Resolution 425 "calling (on Israel) 
to withdraw its forces from all Lebanese territory without 
delay." On 6 June 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon for a second time 
on feeble pretexts. Its army which, under the agreement with 
U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, should not have advanced 
more than 40 km, reached Beirut and bombarded it from land, sea, 
and air. 
  The Security Council quickly passed Resolution 509 
"insisting 
that Israel immediately and unconditionally withdraw all its 
military forces from Lebanon up to Lebanon's internationally 
recognized borders." Despite these two UN Security Council 
resolutions, the Israeli Army still occupies southern Lebanon 
and that has resulted in armed resistance. 
  After calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from 
Lebanon, Iddih said: We must not forget that Lebanon is the 
only Arab state with a Christian president. That is why Lebanon 
should be the last Arab state to sign a peace agreement with 
Israel. Until that happens, Lebanese-Israeli relations should 
only be governed by the armistice agreement signed by the two 
countries on 23 March 1949, which is still valid. 
  Finally, Israel has nothing to fear regarding its security. 
It is the only nuclear power in the region. Its army is the 
strongest and best trained, and it is far superior in that it 
manufactures aircraft, tanks, and arms which it sells abroad. 
  Furthermore, it enjoys the political, financial, and 
military 
support of the United States. That is what has enabled it to 
annex territories that do not belong to it, particularly 
Jerusalem and the Golan and, perhaps some day, southern Lebanon. 
He wondered: In the face of this reality, what could be done 
for the liberation of Lebanon? Will the upcoming 
Clinton-al-Asad meeting find the solution?

  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Iranian Ambassador to Beirut 
Hamayun 'Alizadeh [as transliterated] yesterday called on 
Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul and Army Commander Emile Lahhud, 
introducing Staff Brigadier Kalantari [as transliterated] to 
them "as the Islamic Republic of Iran's first military attache 
in Lebanon." He discussed with them Lebanese developments and 
bilateral relations. 
  'Alizadeh also met with scholar Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah. 
He said that discussions "focused on the need to devote more 
attention to Muslims in view of the serious conditions facing 
them throughout the world." 
  On the U.S. Congress delegation's visit to the region and 
its 
interest in the fate of the missing Israeli solders, when 
Israeli jails are full of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners, he 
said: "Regrettably, this is one of the contradictions of the new 
world order, and can be termed the double standards policy 
pursued by the United States and international circles. While 
the United States devotes special interest to the fate of the 
missing Zionist occupation soldiers, no one talks about the fate 
of the hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinians living in Zionist 
detention centers and the al-Khiyam detention center. It is 
really painful and regrettable."

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri has warned 
that the hour of truth has struck louder and that intentions are 
becoming clear. The enemy has begun to demand its share of land 
and water and to weasel its way out of Resolution 425. 
  After meeting with a delegation from the photographers' 
union, he added that the forced military service campaign 
practiced by the occupation and its agents in the occupied 
border strip is an attempt to justify introducing Lahd's army 
within the ranks of the Lebanese Army. 
  Speaker Nabih Birri discussed some changes that have taken 
place on certain matters: the revival of sectarian grudges in 
sports, for example, as happened between the teams of al-Ansar 
and al-Hikmah; Rabin's visit to the border strip; and the 
introduction of Israeli reinforcements. He noted that this is 
not mere coincidence. He said the Lebanese have once again 
proven that adherence to unity is the best kind of action and 
one of the conditions for resistance. He stressed that there is 
a Lebanese problem before a problem with Israel. There might 
also be a Lebanese-Syrian problem and a Syrian-Jordanian 
problem. He adds: I believe that efforts should be made on the 
internal front to clarify these conspiracies. The Lebanese 
people are capable of taking a united stand. 
  He drew attention to the fact that there are many villages 
that have been wrenched away from Lebanon such as al-Mtullah and 
the seven villages. Talk about Israel's owning 400 dunums 
(approximately 1.4 acres) of al-Mtullah is an Israeli attempt to 
circumvent Resolution 425 and deceive the public.

  Announcing that, Hizballah officials in Beirut said today: 
The objective of the Zionist regime by those attacks is to drag 
the fighters of the Hizballah movement into an endless war in 
order to overshadow the political issues at the coming Syrian 
and American summit in Geneva. 
  He added: Hizballah, with full awareness of the Zionist 
regime's ploy, has adopted a policy of self-restraint, but it 
will retaliate for the aggressions of the occupier Zionists at 
an appropriate time a place.

<F P=106> [Muhammad Shuqayr report: "Hizballah: We Will Not Fall </F>
Into Escalation Trap; We Will Reply at Right Time"] 
  [Text] Beirut -- A prominent Hizballah leader has said that 
in its talks with Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam 
and senior officials, the Hizballah delegation -- comprising 
Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah as head and Political Bureau 
member Hajj Husayn al-Khalil, Deputy Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid, and 
Islamic Amal Movement leader Husayn Musawi as members -- dealt 
with the overall developments on the Lebanese scene. And that 
it also made a number of criticisms of the [Lebanese] 
government, especially with regard to the attitude of state 
institutions, which have begun to act as part of the private 
sector. 
  The prominent leader told AL-HAYAH that a major part of the 
talks held by the Hizballah delegation in the Syrian capital 
over three days was devoted to the upcoming Syrian-U.S. summit 
between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and the 
situation in the south and western al-Biqa'. 
  He quoted senior Syrian officials as saying that the 
al-Asad-Clinton summit represents an important and fundamental 
opportunity to emphasize Syrian constants and principles, which 
refuse in any way to abandon a single inch of the Golan, the 
south, and western al-Biqa', and which support the fateful link 
between the Lebanese and Syrian files. Namely, on the basis of 
rejecting separate solutions and refusing to allow this or that 
party to monopolize the situation, as was the case with the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The leader stressed that the Lebanese and Syrian tracks are 
now like one track, and that Damascus does not accept priority 
being given to one track over the other, because it believes 
that the solution has to be comprehensive. 
  On the situation in the south, the leader emphasized that 
there is a common reading between Damascus and Hizballah of the 
aims behind the continued Israeli aggression. "Tel Aviv is 
seeking to include the security question at the top of the 
Syrian-U.S. summit agenda, so that this issue will dominate the 
other major issues." It was agreed to seize the escalation card 
from Israel's hand in order to deny it the opportunity, so that 
the security question will not dominate the political file to be 
discussed between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. 
  The leader stressed that Israel "has begun again to shell 
civilians in the south and western al-Biqa' before the the 
Syrian-U.S. summit. The aim is to drag us into the game of 
haphazard bombardment. But we will not be dragged into this 
trap, at least for the time being, lest we achieve for Israel 
what it is seeking to achieve. However, we can reply later, 
that is after the Geneva summit proceedings have ended." 
  He added that "Hizballah still has all the options that 
allow 
it to reply to the Israeli escalation. But it reserves the 
right to choose the timing and method it deems suitable. It can 
from now pursue a policy of self-restraint until the summit 
concludes, while choosing a method capable of exerting pressure 
to halt the Israeli aggression on civilians." 
  The leader noted that the Hizballah delegation raised a 
number of issues during its talks with Khaddam. They included 
the following: 
  "-- Hizballah's concerns over the move by some circles close 
to [Lebanese] Prime Minister Rafiz al-Hariri to normalize 
relations with Israel. This was reflected through participation 
in the water conference held in Ankara recently, and also 
through articles published by a Lebanese newspaper and signed by 
figures dealing with financial and economic matters. 
  "-- The attitude of some official institutions and 
departments, which have begun to act as though they are private 
companies. This prompts us to ask about the fate of the 
brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination treaty between 
Lebanon and Syria, which will be difficult to translate into 
something that can achieve cooperation in view of the absence of 
public establishments in Lebanon. 
  "-- The fate of the investigation the government pledged to 
the Chamber of Deputies to conduct into the `airport bridge 
massacre' which took place on 13 September last year, as a 
result of which 50 people were killed or wounded. The 
investigation has still not been completed, as though some 
people are trying to keep this file open to prevent those 
directly responsible from being punished for what happened. We 
will not keep silent about procrastination and will continue to 
demand that the investigation be completed until those 
responsible are identified. 
  "-- Hizballah's view that the government has been negligent 
in many spheres, contrary to what it promised to achieve in the 
ministerial statement, even though we were harmonious when we 
decided to withdraw confidence from it." [sentence as published] 
  On the Syrian position on the remarks made by the Hizballah 
delegation, the prominent leader said that the party was given a 
promise that these issues will be raised at the Lebanese-Syrian 
summit to be held between Presidents Ilyas al-Hirawi and Hafiz 
al-Asad in Damascus after the conclusion of the Syrian-U.S. 
summit and in the presence of Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih 
Birri and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. 
  It is understood that Damascus is still calling for calm in 
Lebanon and for further cooperation and dialogue among all 
parties, saying that regional and international conditions do 
not allow any shocks that are difficult to control. It 
understands some of the remarks and the motives for them. 
However, it believes they can be overcome without reducing the 
role played by the government. If there are criticisms, they 
should be raised in order to strengthen the arena and effect 
action. 
  Damascus did not raise with the Hizballah delegation the 
question of resuming dialogue between it and the prime minister. 
This was confirmed to AL-HAYAH by the prominent leader. 
However, a ministerial source did not rule out the possibility 
of resuming contacts between the two sides, but at a later 
stage. That is, after Syria explores the U.S. position and the 
extent of President Clinton's willingness to fulfill what he 
promised to do, namely to reactivate the peace talks and 
extricate them from the present deadlock. 
  On the mission for which the U.S. Congress delegation 
visited 
Damascus and its tour of a number of west al-Biqa' villages 
which were the scene of ferocious fighting during the Israeli 
invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 -- the tour which coincided 
with the Hizballah delegation's visit to Damascus -- the 
prominent leader pointed out that "there is no link between our 
visit and the presence of U.S. Congress members." He reiterated 
that the presence of Hizballah's delegation and U.S. Congress 
members in Damascus at the same time was not an attempt to 
arrange a meeting under Syrian auspices or to prepare the 
atmosphere for negotiations by correspondence. 
  The leader denied that the U.S. Congress delegation's 
mission 
was discussed on the periphery of Hizballah's talks with 
Khaddam. He said that Hizballah "is adhering to its position and 
is refusing to hold any meetings or exchange any correspondence 
with the Americans, because they lack the characteristics that 
qualify them to play the role of a broker, on the grounds that 
they are a concerned party." 
  The leader cited what Hizballah had told representatives of 
the International Committee of the Red Cross and humanitarian 
organizations, namely that all those captured by Israel -- 
Lebanese and Palestinians -- on Lebanese territory must be 
released as a condition for handing over the bodies of Israeli 
soldiers Hizballah has. He denied that Israeli pilot Ron Arad 
is in Hizballah's custody. 
  He pointed out that Hizballah has no information about the 
possibility of the Red Cross or UN humanitarian organizations 
making a new attempt. He stressed that Hizballah's position is 
clear, "and our condition is the release of all prisoners and 
detainees."

  [Text] There is a strong reaction from Tunisia following 
the accusations made by Amnesty International: the humanitarian 
organisation claims in a report made public today that, despite 
the government's pledges in the field of human rights, torture 
and illegal arrests continue. Amnesty also specifies that the 
repression affects not just the Islamists, but also the 
government's detractors, notably members of the banned Communist 
Party. There has been an immediate reaction from the 
authorities refuting [these allegations] en bloc. Listen to 
Secretary of State for Information Fathi Houidi, speaking to 
Rida Boughezi: 
  [Begin Houidi recording] This is in complete contradiction 
with the real situation experienced by Tunisians in an open, 
tolerant country, where respect for human rights derives from a 
free political choice which is reasoned and open to change. I 
want to point out, in any case, that Amnesty's choice of a date 
to publish this new report on Tunisia has not been made without 
ulterior motives. It comes at a time when the country is 
preparing for free elections, organised after an amendment of 
the electoral law, which guarantees political pluralism within 
the parliament, and at a time when an exceptional revision of 
the electoral lists -- hailed by observers and the opposition 
parties -- has just been made, and finally at a time when 
Tunisia's success is being cited here, there and everywhere as 
an example. It is this precise moment which Amnesty has chosen 
to bring out this report and this communique, in which, in my 
view, prejudice competes with an intention to wreak harm. We 
knew that Amnesty had reached a point where it was not very 
careful of the truth; we were not so aware that it had also 
become so extensively manipulated by the fundamentalists, 
because it is doing nothing other than embracing their ideas and 
adopting all their arguments, which are false. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Shaykh Rached Ghannouchi, the leader of </F>
Tunisia's al-Nahdah Movement, entitled: "The Region and the 
World Poised for a New Lining of Forces"] 
  [Text] The leaders of the Zionist gangs in Palestine and 
elsewhere, through public statements and the use of their 
awesome international media muscle, seek to turn Arab and 
international public opinion against an imminent danger, one 
that threatens to wreck the stability of the Arab region and the 
world and undermine civilization, peace, security, and 
prosperity. This danger, they maintain, is fundamentalism, 
a.k.a. religious extremism or political Islam. 
  The Zionist movement gave the go-ahead for this 
international 
campaign against Islam. The campaign got going with the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and cruised through the 
catastrophic Gulf War and the launch of the Madrid conference 
for a settlement. 
  The campaign found a welcoming ear in Arab regimes faced 
with 
a worsening political and economic crisis, mounting social and 
political demands, and the challenge of Islamic opposition. The 
campaign also reinforced the Western traditional view of Islam 
as a threat to Western interests and agents in the Islamic world. 
  All this led, with an accelerating pace, to the emergence of 
a new lining of forces and interests on the Arab and Islamic 
scene. The handshake between Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin 
was a symbolic milestone on a path that led several Arab 
regimes, both in the Arab Maghreb and the Gulf, to flirt openly 
with the Zionist entity. Those Arab regimes began exploring the 
possibilities of normalizing ties and exchanging interests with 
the Zionist entity, even ahead of a formal recognition. The 
Arab Maghreb regimes began looking into the prospects for 
security, tourism, and cultural exchange with the Zionist 
entity. The Gulf countries began looking into the economic 
aspect and to contemplate lifting the boycott. All this is a 
measure of the noose tightening around Egypt, the largest Arab 
country, which Israel still fears. 
  These developments are occurring behind a smokescreen of 
rhetoric about the fundamentalist danger. A wider and more 
dangerous deception of the masses is under way, the purpose of 
which is to divert their attention from the real danger to their 
civilization, and historical and economic integrity. It is, 
namely, the Zionist entity. 
  The Zionist entity, having usurped Palestine, holy 
Jerusalem, 
and Arab land, is ready for a more dangerous round of expansion 
in which it will seek to dominate the region economically and 
culturally. The Zionist entity will seek to change the region's 
identity and turn it from an Arab and Islamic world aspiring to 
unity and liberation, and restoring its prestige and cultural 
vibrancy to a Middle East region in which there is no room for 
Islam and Arabism. The choicest place, economically, 
politically, and militarily, will be reserved for Israel. The 
Zionist entity threatens to bury the hopes and dreams of our 
nation under the ruins of this region. 
  So where does the real threat to Palestine and its 
honorable Jerusalem, and the Arab and Islamic entity and its 
aspiration to unity lie? Does it really lie in fundamentalism 
and independent, comprehensive development, as the Zionist 
entity and the regimes advocating a peaceful solution--primarily 
Tunisia, Egypt, and Algeria--like to propagate? Or does the 
impending danger threatening the nation lie in Zionism and its 
allies and associates, and in dictatorship and corruption? 
  Against this blatant defiance of the nation, its identity, 
and aspiration to freedom and unity--the defiance that got the 
nation and its resistance elements warmed up--ideologies and 
policies have been restructured and reincarnated. The early 
signs of this can be seen in the Palestinian national movement, 
where there is a center of challenge, a crater, and the theater 
of the conflict between the proponents of a settlement within 
the framework of "the sole legitimate representative" [reference 
to the PLO] and its opponents as represented in the 10 
Palestinian factions that constitute the strategic alliance 
between the Islamists and the leftist, nationalist current. 
  Judging by the historic status that the Palestinian cause 
assumed among the circles of the pan-Arab, Islamic, and 
nationalist struggle, and by the challenges the Zionist entity 
poses the nation's existence, we expect a new strategic 
Palestinian structure to extend up to and beyond the struggling 
arenas in the Arab and Islamic worlds. 
  If this is the case, then two camps will emerge in the 
coming 
years. The first will be made up of the nationalists, the 
pan-Arab, and Islamic regimes and movements that insist on 
pursuing the goals of the Islamic, pan-Arab, and national 
struggle for independence, freedom, unity, and justice on the 
land of Islam, and democracy. This camp will be up against a 
second camp embracing the regimes, movements, and currents that 
wager on normalization with the Zionist entity, sacrificing the 
pan-Arab objectives, and on diminishing the Islamic role and 
message. Their only road to this will be violence and 
dictatorship. 
  The dimensions and scope of such a battle go beyond the 
Palestinian and even the Arab, Islamic entity to the human 
struggle, because of the Zionist entity's influence worldwide 
and its expansionist ambitions on every level. It perpetuates 
the eternal struggle between right and wrong, progress and 
backwardness, between the powers of liberation and arrogance, 
and between prophets and idols. What a great battle, a splendid 
gift sent by heavenly providence in the hand of Zionism and its 
allies to reorganize the ranks of the nation and mobilize them 
for a clear cause. (The unbelievers plot and plan, and God too 
plans, and the best of planners is God.) [Koranic verse]

  [Text] Reports indicate that the situation in Afghanistan 
is still tense, and that the warring factions have bombed each 
others' positions and caused damage. Moreover, forces opposing 
Rabbani's government have reiterated their demand for the 
president's resignation. They have, furthermore, formed a new 
political-military organization, called the Coordination Council 
[Shoray-e Hamahangi] of Afghanistan's Islamic Revolution 
[CCAIR]. Our correspondent in Kabul reports on the latest 
developments in Afghanistan: 
  Since this morning, battles between the warring factions in 
Kabul have intensified. Haji Farid, a spokesmen for Hezb-e 
Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], said that extensive 
offensives by the forces opposing Rabbani's government began at 
10.00 today, Kabul time. The offensives were waged from five 
different fronts in the south and southeast of the Afghan 
capital, and the attacking forces attempted to infiltrate the 
defense lines set up by Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's forces. 
  Battles in Kabul intensified after the government opposition 
groups issued a statement announcing the formation of a new 
political-military organization called the CCAIR. The 
statement, which was issued yesterday, states that without the 
resignation of Borhanoddin Rabbani from the presidency, the 
battles in Kabul will continue. In response to the statement, a 
spokesman for Afghan President Rabbani announced yesterday that 
Rabbani's government is prepared to tender its resignation only 
after general elections are held in 6 months' time. 
  In an interview today, the Hezb-e Eslami spokesman said: The 
precondition set by the opposition forces calling for Rabbani's 
resignation still stands, and Afghan Prime Minister Hekmatyar 
has promised that he will resign after Rabbani does so. 
  Meanwhile, reports indicate that last night and this 
morning, 
General Dostam's war planes repeatedly bombed the positions of 
Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's forces, situated in the heights around 
Kabul's television station, the presidential palace and Bagram 
airport in northeast Kabul. In retaliation, Rabbani's war 
planes bombed the positions held by Hezb-e Eslami and General 
Dostam in the south and southeast of the capital.

  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful: 
At its session of 12 February, members of the coordination 
charter unanimously agreed on--because the propaganda jehad as 
well as the armed jehad are an objective necessity--a 
declaration of the coordination charter of the Islamic Parties 
of Afghanistan: to harmonize propaganda and give it the same 
direction in different fields and in various aspects of war; to 
exchange views and information; and to enlighten the public 
about current events and issues of the country in order that 
each one of the parties, members of the coordination charter, 
can participate in the supply and publication of news and to 
campaign against the propaganda of the enemy force. Therefore, 
we inform our compatriots about the establishment of a 
propaganda commission with the following details: 
  Every party will introduce two of its literary and scholarly 
personalities for participation in the propaganda commission. 
Scholarly brothers of parties can send their scientific and 
political articles and texts to the propaganda commission. 
  Islamic parties, members of the charter, [words indistinct]. 
Ulema, mosque prayer leaders, officials of shia ceremonial 
sites, and other brothers are asked to participate in the 
enlightening of the people of the city's wards as a religious 
duty. 
  Radio and television staff are asked to harmonize their 
propaganda programs with the propaganda commission and [words

  [Text] Paris, Jan 14 (AFP)--The main opposition movement to 
the Iranian Government denied late Thursday having planted two 
bombs that exploded in the center of Tehran, wounding three 
people. 
  The Mojahedin-e Khalq said in a statement published by its 
Paris office that "it never carries out bomb attacks that 
endanger the lives of innocent people," adding that it "clearly 
condemns this sort of act." 
  Three passers-by were wounded and shops were damaged near 
Ferdowsi Square in downtown Tehran late Thursday when two bombs 
apparently placed in a rubbish bin exploded on a street corner, 
the official news agency IRNA said in Tehran. 
  A woman later phoned IRNA from Paris to claim responsibility 
for the blast on behalf of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, Iran's main 
armed opposition group, the agency reported. 
  An IRNA reporter saw an ambulance rushing three people to 
hospital, where officials said one of them was critically 
injured.

  [Text] At least five leaders of the terrorist monafeqin 
[hypocrites--the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] were 
killed and several wounded in bloody clashes between two groups. 
  The 15 December clash took place during an attack by members 
of a monafeqin splinter group, who call themselves the Execution 
Squad, at the monafeqin's central garrison in Dayr in southeast 
Iraq. A group of Kurds also assisted in the attack against the 
three-story command post. 
  A former member of the monafeqin group who fled to Jordan 
said on Saturday: The attack took place at 0530 [0100 GMT] on 
15 December. The target was the operations control center of 
the monafeqin in Basra and the headquarters of Mehdi 
Abrishamchi, former husband of Maryan 'Azodanlu, third wife of 
monafeqin leader Mas'ud Rajavi. During the attack, seven 
missiles were fired at the building and five leaders of the 
terrorist group were killed on the spot. 
  A former member of the monafeqin group, who says he deserted 
because of the group's spying and terrorist activities, listed 
the dead as follows: Mas'ud Mazlumi from Tehran, vice chairman 
of the monafeqin's executive committee and one of the commanders 
of the group's terrorist squad; Sadiqeh Ebrahimi from Tehran, 
member of the so-called executive committee and one of the 
leaders of the group's terrorist squad; Ahmad Afshar from 
Mashhad, member of the so-called executive committee and one of 
the main elements of the group's terrorist squad; Adham Tayyebi 
from Tehran, the head of the organization's institutions and 
commander of the terrorist group; and Zahra Hosnipur "Hoseynpur" 
from Tehran, member of the executive committee and a head of the 
terrorist squad. 
  The former member said: After the victory of the Islamic 
revolution, these five people were directly involved in 
terrorist attacks on farmers living in border regions. 
  According to Kurdish sources in northern Iraq, the attackers 
were members of a splinter group that had deserted the main 
group long ago in a bid to flee Iraq and was in hiding. They 
gained the support of Kurds who oppose the presence of the 
monafeqin in Iraq for the attack on the monafeqin headquarters. 
The Kurds regard the monafeqin as Ba'thist agents and overtly 
threaten to take revenge.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Attack on the British Embassy in </F>
Tehran"] 
  [Excerpt] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Official 
sources said yesterday that the British Embassy in central 
Tehran was the target of a machinegun attack "resulting in some 
material damage." There were no casualties in the attack that 
was carried out by persons unknown who somehow managed to drive 
a car through the heavily guarded streets of central Tehran late 
Tuesday night. 
  According to Tehran sources, Britain requested a "full 
investigation" with "appropriate measures." A paper reflecting 
the views of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani accused 
Mojahedin-e-Khalq, the organization in exile, of carrying out 
the attack, but the latter denied any connection with the attack 
and accused the government of fabricating the incident. In a 
telephone call to a Tehran paper a hitherto unheard of 
organization called "the Imam's Soldiers" claimed 
responsibility. 
  Britain has had no ambassador in Tehran since the mullahs 
seized power in 1979. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mahmud Va'ezi, deputy foreign minister for 
Euro-American affairs, described American efforts to disrupt 
Europe's relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran as futile, 
saying: Relations between European countries and Iran are 
independent and based on long-term interests. 
  Mr. Va'ezi, who was speaking to a Central News Unit 
correspondent, stressed that at present, Iran and European 
countries enjoy good relations, adding: Dealing with 
international issues, the Islamic Republic of Iran acts on the 
basis of its own independently worked-out principles. 
  Speaking on the efforts of the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
resolve the Karabakh crisis, Mr. Va'ezi said: Following the 
recent requests made by the republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia 
asking Iran to mediate in the Karabakh dispute, our country's 
Foreign Ministry director general for eastern Europe travelled 
to Yerevan and Baku to investigate the problem. He pointed out 
that the Karabakh problem has entered a new phase, saying: 
During his recent visit to Tehran, a Russian special envoy 
presented a plan for resolving the Karabakh crisis. It was 
decided that the plan be studied and the interests of the 
warring sides be taken into consideration. 
  Our country's deputy foreign minister for Euro-American 
affairs then referred to the broad support of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran for the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
said: Initiated by the Islamic Republic of Iran, foreign 
affairs ministers of the contact group [goruh-e tamas] 
countries, represented by the Islamic Conference Organization, 
will hold a joint meeting in Geneva this Sunday [16 January] to 
study the latest developments in Bosnia- Herzegovina. The 
president of Bosnia-Herzegovina will take part in the meeting.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Type of Criticism?"] </F>
  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's speech at the Friday 
Mass Prayer and his detailed report on the country's economic 
situation have set in motion a series of debates in political 
circles in the country. 
  The debates are mostly centered on the types of criticism 
levelled on the government's performance in the past few years 
especially in connection with the implementation of the 5-year 
Development Plan. 
  It is an undeniable fact that the enemies of the Islamic 
Revolution, in particular the U.S., do not wish Iran to be 
successful in its social reconstruction programs, and to be 
turned into a prominent economic power. 
  The U.S. used the same strategy in its fight against 
communism, and finally succeeded in using that ideology's 
flagrant economic weakness to deliver the fatal blow at an 
appropriate moment. It should be pointed out that the collapse 
of communism was brought about by a complex combination of 
factors. 
  America has already used various tactics against Iran such 
as 
arranging coup d'etat and giving the green light to Iraq to 
invade Iran, and it has failed to undermine the foundations of 
the Islamic Republic. So now America is trying to strike at us 
with the economic weapon. In pursuit of that strategy the U.S. 
has been exerting various types of pressures on the European 
countries to make them restrict their economic cooperations with 
Iran. 
  One of the economic weapons with which America hopes to deal 
destructive blows on Iran is to spread false rumors about Iran's 
economic position and to create an atmosphere of instability and 
distrust regarding Iran's economic successes. It is a great 
economic success that in 5 years time electricity breakdowns 
will reach zero level, gas pipelines construction will have been 
completed in 200 cities and towns, vast portions of surface 
water sources will have been harnessed and telephone 
communication facilities will have spread to the remotest 
villages. 
  Alongside of all of these successes, the press and the other 
mass media have every right to express their constructive 
criticism. 
  There have undoubtedly been shortcomings in the planning and 
implementation of parts of the 5-Year Plan, and now at the 
conclusion of the Development Plan, it is the indisputable right 
of the press to undertake an analytic examination of the First 
Plan for the purpose of using the experiences gained from its 
implementation in the Second Plan. 
  It is our firm belief that a clear-cut distinction should be 
made between constructive and subversive criticisms.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "A Political Analysis of the </F>
Foreign Exchange Crisis"] 
  [Text] Even though dollar and foreign exchange rates are an 
economic issue and fall within the framework of monetary and 
financial policies, it is obvious that they are an important 
instrument for the implementation of arrogant policies. The 
recent crisis in foreign exchange is actually a political issue, 
because with the protraction of this crisis the United States 
expects the downfall of the anti-U.S. government in Iran. This 
crisis arose immediately following the explicit remarks by the 
leader concerning the United States. Foreign radios and the 
mouthpieces of the policies of the West and of Zionism have 
stated that by the end of 1993, the exchange rate would reach 
2,500 rials to the dollar and that by the end of the Iranian 
year it will reach 3,000 rials. Some have also said that it 
should be 10,000 rials to one dollar. 
  Actually, the United States wants to use this method to 
increase inflation and drive up prices. This will make the 
people disenchanted with Islam and the revolution and force them 
to agree to establish relations with the United States, thinking 
that such relations will resolve all our problems. If the 
Iranian statesmen are not willing to do so, they will be 
overthrown! And a pro-U.S. regime will come to power! 
  It is very interesting to know that the dollar-rial exchange 
rate is determined in the United States. As the United States 
cannot establish direct contact with Iran, it operates through 
the Dubayy foreign exchange market. At the outset of the 
crisis, foreign exchange dealers have only been purchasing 
foreign exchange and transferring these funds abroad--to 
Dubayy--because a higher rate for the dollar can be obtained 
there. 
  There is a clear answer to why this mechanism is being used. 
Through the banking mechanism, the United States is instigating 
inflation in Iran. With the rise in foreign exchange rates, the 
prices of imported items increase. In turn, the high prices of 
foreign exchange-related goods affect the prices of domestic 
products, and inflation becomes a vicious circle. 
  It may be asked how the United States benefits from all 
this. 
The United States is ready to spend billions of dollars to 
defeat an independent government. During 28 Mordad 1332 [19 
August 1953 coup which overthrew Dr. Mosaddeq's rule] and other 
similar coups, the United States showed that it is willing to 
spend whatever is necessary to establish its new world order and 
diktat. These financial interventions concerning Iran, however, 
are made indirectly; in other words, the United States makes up 
the difference in the exchange rate of the Iranian rial and pays 
for it with its arrogant expenditures; and foreign exchange 
dealers and the fugitive Iranian subservient elements who are 
living in the United States are ready to invest billions of 
rials in order to be able to return to this country and once 
again take power. 
  Everything will be clarified by the end of this year [21 
March 1994]. Inflation and high prices will assume crisis 
proportions. In view of this, there are two alternatives. If 
the people are unable to deal with the crisis and complain about 
high prices and inflation, the government will either fall or 
will have to accept the unwritten resolution of the United 
States in this economic war. But if the people resist and 
declare, as they did at the outset of the revolution, that they 
will tolerate oil and electricity shortages and pledge 
allegiance to the martyrs, then it is the U.S. Government that 
will fall, because the crisis will be transferred to the United 
States, which will then disintegrate. 
  The United States will, however, actually be harmed from two 
directions in the process: On the one hand, it is spending 
taxpayers' money in its futile attempt to overthrow the Iranian 
Government; and on the other, if it fails it will be unable to 
start a new propaganda wave because the United States is 
actually playing with U.S. public opinion now and is showing its 
people that it has been able plunge Iran's economy into crisis. 
If it succeeds in defeating Iran, no one in the United States 
will protest. But if Iran wins, then opposition inside the 
United States will definitely grow.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Kabul War and Iran's National Security"] </F>
  [Text] An upsurge in Afghanistan's bloody clashes has 
prompted the United Nations Secretary General Butrus-Butrus 
Ghali to urge the warring sides to speedily put a halt to the 
confrontations and strive to peacefully resolve the matter. 
  Amidst the new spate of Afghan fightings, the Geneva-based 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Tuesday 
announced that the recent whirlwind of clashes could beset the 
four neighbors of Afghanistan--especially Iran and 
Pakistan--with an influx of refugees. 
  A point worthy of consideration meantime is that the present 
war in Afghanistan is neither ethnic nor religious nor national: 
It is merely a power struggle that pitifully has not only 
tarnished the 13-year-long struggle of the Afghan people but has 
also posed a serious peril to the prestige of the global Islamic 
movement. 
  Developments in Afghanistan definitely bear close 
relationship with Iran's national security. Kabul's devastating 
and ruinous war will pose danger for Iran both in terms of its 
ideological objectives and national interests. 
  Pitifully, however, the Iranian Foreign Ministry sluggishly 
carried out just one not-so-successful move of establishing a 
several-hour-long cease-fire in Kabul. 
  Aptly, the Foreign Ministry could have launched an extensive 
diplomatic overture by contacting the involved sides, as well as 
Pakistan, some regional countries, and especially the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (ICO) to preclude the 
spread and perpetuation of the Afghan genocide. This diplomatic 
sluggishness is in no way justifiable. 
  Meantime, the self-restraint so far exercised by the 
Afghanistan Islamic Unity Party [Hezb-e Wahdat] in avoiding 
involvement in the recent fightings is laudable. 
  Hopefully, this self-restraint will be kept up, and the said 
party will assume the role of mediator as the best stance that 
could be adopted. In principle, the former clashes that were 
flared by some groups with this party actually did not augur 
well for the future of Afghanistan, producing no positive 
results.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Real Beneficiaries of an Independent </F>
Kurdistan"] 
  [Text] Dismemberment of Iraq's Kurdistan is a serious 
security threat to the entire Middle East. 
  Over the past few days, Iraq's Kurdistan has witnessed 
bloody 
clashes and conflicts sparked by heavy attacks launched by Jalal 
Talabani's group against the Muslim Kurdish Movement. 
  Through these hostilities are commonplace in Northern Iraq, 
the bloodshed in the past several days has been too violent and 
horrendous even by Iraqi standards. 
  Despite all these atrocities in northern Iraq, the Western 
mass media have been suspiciously silent. 
  In fact, taking advantage of the post-Persian Gulf War 
conditions, the West strives to promote "ethnic nationalism" 
aimed at paving the way for the dismemberment of the regional 
countries. 
  To reach this goal, the West is manipulating the weakest 
link 
in the area's security chain, namely the Kurds. 
  In the first phase, the West set forth the issue of "the 
Kurdish Parliament," and in the second stage it put forward the 
concept of "the Kurdish government." To this end, the West made 
utmost use of Iraq's current confused political climate. 
  In view of the West's hatred of Saddam Husayn, their next 
move will be to promote the recognition of this self-proclaimed 
"Kurdish government". 
  A plot of profound depth and breadth is thus in the offing, 
namely, the creation of a new Israel in the region possessing 
the Karkuk oil resources which can seriously jeopardize the 
territorial integrity of all the regional countries. 
  With time racing ahead, the massacre of the Muslim Kurds by 
Talabani's group should serve as a serious warning to all 
concerned parties. 
  Actually, this signifies that Talabani and his group have 
been designated to be in charge of enforcing this plot, and 
recent massacres prove that they are ready to go to any length 
and to commit any crime in order to bring this sinister plot to 
fruition. 
  Consequently, co-operation between Iran and Turkey, as the 
pivotal core of a coalition, is called for to thwart this 
Western ploy. 
  Alongside this collaboration, the two should also consult 
with Iraq and Syria. 
  In recent years Saddam's regime has meted out a great deal 
of 
oppression to the Iraqi Kurds. It should, however, be borne in 
mind that all Iraqis have been subjected to oppression. But 
this does not necessarily mean that the Iraqi Shiites, for 
example, will opt for dismemberment of Iraq. 
  Today, the conspiracy to dismember Iraq's Kurdistan stands 
out as a serious peril, therefore, providing moral, political, 
or material support to these groups by Turkey and Syria cannot 
be justified, and in this regard convening of an extraordinary 
meeting of the foreign ministers of Iran, Turkey, and Syria is 
called for at this time.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Decisionmaking on the Leadership Level"] </F>
  [Text] The first oil deals in 1994 were concluded last 
Monday. The New Year began with reports on probable agreement 
among OPEC members on production cutbacks and an early meeting 
-- prior to the previously determined date. The combination of 
these factors brought about a slight rise in the price of oil in 
the early days of the year. 
  In transactions concluded on the final days of 1993, oil 
prices sank to the lowest level in the past five years, and the 
average price for OPEC oil basket was fixed around $12.67. 
  The 30 percent decline in oil price in 1993 created serious 
difficulties for most of the petroleum exporting countries. 
  Iran and Saudi Arabia have always played key roles in OPEC 
since the creation of this highly significant world economic 
organization in 1960. In fact OPEC is the only international 
organization which sets price on a single raw material that is 
produced mainly by a number of Third World countries. The 
industrially advanced countries of the world have never really 
liked this system of price determination. They had been 
accustomed for too long to the arrogant assumption that it was 
their natural right to determine prices both for the raw 
materials they imported from the Third World countries as well 
as the price of the industrial commodities they exported to 
those countries. That is why they have always been trying to 
weaken OPEC and undermine its very foundations. 
  Even before the Islamic Revolution in February 1979, the 
industrial powers of the world tried to create tensions between 
Tehran and Riyadh, and although at that time government systems 
in both countries were monarchies attached to the West, for the 
reasons cited above the industrial powers of the world did 
everything and mostly succeeded in keeping bilateral ties 
between the two countries in a strained condition, specially 
during the 8 years of Iraq's war of aggression against Iran. 
  Nevertheless, in spite of all the casualties and the losses 
to which the countries in the region had been subjected, the 
events of the war had the ironic effect of lifting the veil of 
deception and exposing the bare truth. The countries in the 
region, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia which perform key 
roles, realized the problems of the region and its security 
needs will have to be settled and resolved through peaceful 
cooperation among themselves. And once the regional countries 
have learned to settle the basic issue of the regional security 
through peaceful strategies, more expanded cooperations such as 
preserving their natural right to set the price of oil will 
automatically follow. 
  No doubt small groups in both Tehran and Riyadh will try to 
create tension and crisis between the two countries. But these 
groups are not in decisive positions in either of the two 
capitals, and in the final analysis what counts is the decisions 
reached at the level of the leaders of the two countries 
regarding the creation of cordial relationships.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Middle East--1994"] </F>
  [Text] In 1993, the Middle East saw Lebanon at peace but 
in a state of flux, Iraq in a state of inertia bowing low before 
the United States and the West, and 'Arafat bartering away the 
pride of the Muslim, heroic nation of Palestine. 
  In 1993, conditions were not the same in all countries of 
the 
region, but there were some common denominators. In light of 
the Gaza-Jericho accord, the face of the Middle East will 
undergo a transformation in 1994 as the United States gains its 
objectives based on the trend toward compromise. 
  Most of the countries will relinquish part of their 
geopolitical positions, and countries that are emulating the 
U.S. model will gain from this situation. It is an immutable 
fact that a large part of the world's oil resources are 
concentrated in the Middle East, but there is no sign of any 
development patterns in the region. If, in 1993, the Middle 
East witnessed Clinton's hosting Rabin and 'Arafat in the White 
House, it was solely because during the eighties, a country by 
the name of Iraq had embarked on an extensive war and opened the 
path for the West to enter Islamic countries in the nineties. 
This is the beginning of the end of an era in which resistance 
took on a different connotation. 
  In the current year, the United States is contemplating the 
manifestation of another Gaza-Jericho accord so that it can make 
the region subservient and calm. The region should at the same 
time be a center for harboring a potential crisis that can be 
escalated into a war when the need arises. 
  If those countries that are on the U.S. blacklist do not 
react, they will not get a chance to defend themselves. 
International economic conditions have transformed the Middle 
East into an oil-producing area and at the same time a consumer 
of goods. By the end of 1993, the Middle East oil prices had 
reached an unimaginable all-time low, despite the onset of the 
cold winter season. The hue and cry for human rights is also 
heard and most Middle East leaders have not yet understood the 
meaning of unity, of ending their differences, and may perhaps 
never do so. 
  What makes the difficult days of the nineties bearable for 
the free nations of the region, however, is the cry of the 
intifadah. 
  In any case, the Americans will step up their pressure on 
the 
progressive and independent countries of the region in order to 
eliminate the last vestiges of resistance. They will certainly 
adopt an independent approach toward each country so that the 
others do not wake up to it and are not aware of the danger. 
The Middle East of 1994 will be replete with compromising 
plans and levers of pressure for the United States so that a new 
picture may be drawn up.

  [Excerpts] Today's Tehran Friday prayers were led by 
Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani at Tehran University with the 
participation of the masses of worshippers. Friday prayers were 
also held throughout the country. 
  On the occasion of the 40th day of the demise of the scholar 
associated with the immaculate Ahl al-Beit family, Grand 
Ayatollah Golpayegani -- sanctified be his soul -- the interim 
Friday imam of Tehran in his first sermon praised his eminence's 
knowledge and piety, his services to Islam and seminaries, as 
well as his struggles to defend Islamic values. He said that 
his eminence's demise was a great loss to the world of Islam. 
  The Friday prayer leader referred to the point that 
jurisprudence, piety, knowledge of current affairs and the 
capability to defend religion are the basic conditions of 
Marja'iyat. Continuing, he said that considering the personality 
of Grand Ayatollah Araki, particularly his eminence's knowledge 
and piety, and that today, the Marja'iyat of the Shi'as is 
limited to the person of Grand Ayatollah Araki. [passage omitted] 
  The interim Friday prayer imam of Tehran referred to 
different conspiracies hatched by the word of blasphemy and 
arrogance against Muslims, and said: The sorrowful situations 
in Palestine, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Afghanistan, and other 
crisis-ridden areas of the world of Islam are all due to the 
hostility of the enemies of Islam, which appear in various 
forms. He went on to say that their efforts to silence the voice 
of Islam is futile and the light of Islam, now more than ever, 
attracts the hearts of the justice-seeking people of the world 
and will continue to do so.

  [Text] The political and religious sermons of the Friday 
prayers of Tehran were held today by the interim Friday prayer 
leader of Tehran, Ayatollah Emami-Kashani. The interim Friday 
prayer leader of Tehran in the sermon on the occasion of the 
40th day after the demise of Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani 
elaborated on the life of this divine scholar and commemorated 
him. 
  Ayatollah Emami-Kashani, in continuation of the prayers, 
while commemorating martyrs of the Islamic revolution and the 
imposed war, praised the disabled, the missing in action and the 
POWs of the Islamic Iran. 
  The interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran, pointing to the 
enmity of the arrogant powers with Islam said: The United 
Nations and the West commit crimes against Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the world arrogant powers and the 
Zionism commit crimes in Palestine and Lebanon, and their 
intervention in Afghanistan has made the Afghan groups fight 
each other. The interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran then 
stated that the arrogant powers must know that their crimes only 
disgrace them in the eyes and opinion of the world nations and 
they will never succeed in destroying Islam.

  [Text] Reports from Afghanistan speak of intense fighting 
as General Dostam's forces launched an overnight assault against 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani's forces. A spokesman for 
President Rabbani's troops said they have repulsed the attack. 
General Dostam's jet planes also attacked key positions in 
Kabul. According to the International Red Cross estimate, at 
least 4,000 people have been wounded in the past 12 days and 
hundreds more are feared dead. The UN secretary general has 
stressed the need for humanitarian assistance for the displaced 
Afghan people. In a statement, the secretary general deplored 
large-scale fighting in Kabul and called for an immediate end to 
the fighting. 
  The government of Pakistan, with the collaboration of 
Jalalabad Shura [council], has decided to set up two camps 
inside Afghanistan to facilitate delivery of relief assistance 
to the displaced people. The commissioner for Afghan refugees, 
Rustam Shah Momen, told a meeting in Peshawar today that two 
camps with the capacity of 100,000 will be set up in Samarkhel 
and Asrashahi near Jalalabad. The meeting was attended by the 
representatives of the United Nations and aid giving NGO's 
[nongovernmental organizations] to discuss the arrangements for 
providing shelter and emergency relief to the war affectees of 
Afghanistan. The commissioner for Afghan refugees asked the 
United Nations agencies and other NGO's to transfer their 
establishment to new sites inside Afghanistan. He apprised them 
of the decision regarding the closure of the Pak-Afghan border 
and said that the government does not recognize the new arrivals 
as refugees. However, the Afghans, who have already crossed the 
border, are being accommodated in Nazir Bagh and Agha Khel 
tented villages near Peshawar.

  [Text] Peshawar -- The Pakistan government Wednesday sealed 
the border with the war-ravaged Afghanistan, rendering several 
thousand Afghans stranded at Torkham. 
  Almost 10,000 uprooted Kabulis are waiting on the Afghan 
side 
of Torkham for the gates to open, informed eyewitness when 
contacted by telephone. The figure appeared to be on the high 
side but the number of people who reached Torkham was 
substantial and had certainly grown to a few thousand by 
Wednesday evening. Pakistani border guards estimated that more 
than 66 vehicles which brought the refugees were also denied 
entry and now parked on the Afghans side of the border. 
  The border was sealed on a day when Kabul was bombed at 
least 
seven times by Gen Rashid Dostam's warplanes and even the 
relatively safe Khairkhana area in northern part of the city was 
rocketed, killing 10 people and injuring many more. 
  Habibullah Khan, political agent, KHYBER AGENCY, told THE 
NEWS that they had sealed the border on the instructions of the 
federal government, which apparently communicated the decision 
to the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] government Tuesday. 
He said the Afghans possessing Pakistan's visa were being 
allowed to enter Pakistan. 
  Beside Torkham, the second official crossing point between 
Pakistan and Afghanistan is Chaman in Balochistan province. The 
gates at the two border towns are opened at sunrise and closed 
by sunset. There is a large number of other passes and routes 
on the 1300-mile Durand Line which serves as a boundary between 
the two neighbouring states. The border is long and porous and 
cannot be policed. 
  A federal government official, requesting anonymity, while 
confirming the sealing of the border, said the stage had come to 
implement an administrative decision that was long overdue. He 
said the decision was reached after exhaustive discussions and 
weighing all pros and cons. We are willing to provide the 
required support to the displaced Afghans in their own country, 
he argued. 
  He said Pakistan with help from the UN and NGOs 
[non-governmental organizations] had sent tents, flour and other 
relief goods for the refugees in Jalalabad and would provide 
more help once these people were resettled in camps set up in 
Samarkhel and Dosaraka Hissarshahi. 
  Earlier in Islamabad, a Foreign Office spokesman had denied 
reports about the closure of border. He, however, added that 
Pakistan and the UN were trying to resettle the Afghans fleeing 
the fighting in Kabul on Afghan territory. He also said 14,410 
Afghans who entered Pakistan since the outbreak of hostilities 
on New Year registered themselves. An unspecified number of new 
arrivals, he added, had also come through other crossing points 
on the border. 
  The federal government had taken a decision about sealing of 
the border in the past as well but it was subsequently 
withdrawn. It remains to be seen how serious is the government 
in implementing this decision. In any case, the Afghans wanting 
to enter Pakistan may use the other unofficial crossing points. 
  As the stranded Afghans prepared to spend a chilly winter 
night at Torkham in miserable conditions, the closure of the 
border also blocked the routine flow of hundreds of the people 
from both countries across the border. 
  The federal government decision took the NWFP government by 
surprise. Only a couple of days ago, the Foreign Office had 
said no Afghan refugee would be turned back at Torkham. A 
high-ranking provincial government officer, who wished 
anonymity, wondered at the logic behind the sudden decision. He 
recalled that 100,000 Afghans who crossed in to Pakistan after 
the battles of Kabul last year were all accommodated in NWFP 
without putting much burden on the government. He argued that 
most of them were settled in camps vacated by the repatriating 
refugees while a substantial number took up residence with 
relations and friends in Peshawar. The new arrivals, he 
pointed, too were from Kabul and would like to live in Peshawar 
or other urban centres in the province. 
  Meanwhile, reports from Kabul said Dostam's aircraft bombed 
Rabbani government installations in the capital and in Charikar, 
Jebel-us-Straj and Bagram. The Television hillock was another 
target for these jet-fighters, which reportedly flew from 
Mazar-e Sharif. 
  Radio Kabul, which had gone off the air on the first day of 
the ongoing battle for Kabul on January 1, resumed its 
broadcasts Wednesday on another frequency.

  [Text] Quetta, Jan 13: A senior government official said on 
Thursday that he has no orders from Interior Ministry about 
sealing of Pak-Afghan borders to block the influx of refugees, 
fleeing from Afghanistan due to fresh fighting erupted among 
rival Afghan groups in Kabul. 
  "Certainly there isn't any extraordinary movement for 
refugees across the Durand line (which divides both countries)," 
Nayyar Agha, Commissioner Quetta Division told THE MUSLIM. 
  He said the Home Department did not issue orders to seal 
borders or turn back refugees across the country's southern 
flanks with Afghanistan. 
  Meanwhile sources in Afghan Commissionerate when contacted 
said that till date, not a single refugee crossed into Chaman 
from Southern Qandahar Province. 
  Sources said civilian fleeing fighting in Kabul were mainly 
moving or have settled in Jalalabad city and did not turn to 
southern parts of Afghanistan for shelter. 
  Balochistan remained home to nearly a million Afghans, 
though 
the figures were widely believed to be exaggerated. Many 
refugees returned home when Afghan fighters took over Kabul 
after President Najibullah stopped down, but their shuttling 
across the borders continued due to sporadic factional clashes 
among Afghans for gaining power and arms depots. 
  APP adds: The planned voluntary repatriation of about 85000 
Afghan refugees to Afghanistan via Quetta may not start in April 
next if fighting continues in Kabul, UNHCR officials told APP 
here Thursday. 
  The repatriation had earlier postponed due to some 
misunderstandings between the Iranian government and the UNHCR 
regarding the modalities of delivering repatriation assistance 
to refugees. 
  Only recently the Iranian government agreed to allow the 
exodus with the repatriation assistance to refugees be given in 
Pakistan before their entry to Afghanistan the immediate 
repatriation could not be started in view of the onset of 
winters and freezing temperatures in Afghanistan. 
  If fighting in Kabul and northern Afghanistan stops the 
exodus may start some time in the month of April. 
  The Balochistan route for exodus of these refugees was 
chosen 
for being safer than those between Iran and Afghanistan.

  [Text] Azad Kashmir Prime Minister Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan 
urged the international media to take serious note of the 
large-scale violation of human rights and atrocities committed 
by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir. He was addressing a joint 
meeting of the Press Advisory Council and the Consultative 
Committee of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Islamabad today. The 
meeting adopted a resolution condemning the Indian Government's 
ban on the entry of representatives from the human rights 
organizations and the mass media into occupied Kashmir. The 
resolution says the ban has been imposed to cover up the brutal 
activities of Indian forces in the occupied area. The meeting 
called on the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] to convene a 
special meeting on Kashmir and also urged the Pakistani 
Government to make a formal request to the ICO in this regard. 
  The meeting welcomed the UN secretary general's annual 
report 
calling for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's reference to Kashmir at the UN General 
Assembly, which, the meeting hoped, will greatly help the 
implementation of UN resolutions on Kashmir.

  [Text] Islamabad (APP) -- India has purchased three surface 
to air Stinger missiles from various Afghan commanders, sources 
said here Thursday. 
  Indian interest in Stinger was primarily to use the American 
technology for upgrading their Akash series of missiles which 
have not produced satisfactory results during the trials, they 
said. Indians have been desperately trying to enhance the 
capability of Akash to use it as an anti-missile-missile capable 
of engaging multiple targets. 
  In this context India had also approached Israel for 
transfer 
of technology of Arrow anti-missile-missile which is a joint 
venture of USA and Israel. 
  Informed sources have confirmed that access to Stinger 
technology would significantly help India in improving the 
performance of Akash missiles. It may also be recalled that the 
Clinton administration had allocated huge sums for purchasing 
the Stingers from the Mojahedin to obviate the possibility of 
these being delivered to a third country. 
  It may be mentioned here that the Indian intelligence 
agencies operating in Afghanistan and having links with Afghan 
counterparts Khad/WAD were making hectic efforts to establish 
rapport with various Mujahideen groups for this purpose since 
quite some time.

<F P=106> [By Ali Abbas Rizvi] </F>
  [Text] Kamra -- The Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) 
has acquired the capability to overhaul the F-7, the latest 
Chinese weapon system in the Pakistan Air Force's inventory. 
The first overhauled F-7 will roll out of the Pakistan 
Aeronautical Complex at Kamra by the end of January. 
  In an exclusive interview to The News, the PAC Director 
General, Air Marshal Dilawar Hussain, said that the F-6 Rebuild 
Factory (F-6RF) had successfully overhauled the first F-7 while 
mostly using its existing facilities. "We are now manufacturing 
some 126 parts of the F-7", the Air Marshal said. "Inshallah, 
we would undertake to manufacture some 4,000 parts of the 
aircraft by the end of 1994. This capability will increase over 
the years." 
  The F-6 Rebuild Factory, which has undertaken the overhaul 
of 
the F-7, was established in 1974. It over-hauled the first F-6 
fighter in 1981 and its two-seat trainer FT-6 in 1985. The 
factory gradually expanded its facilities to undertake the 
overhauling of FT-5 trainers. The first overhauled FT-5 
aircraft rolled out in 1987 and the first A-5 III in 1988. 
  Air Marshal Dilawar said the first F-7 was taken up for 
overhaul by the factory in April 1993. "We had the necessary 
basic infrastructure for the overhaul and had made few additions 
to our facilities for the F-7 overhaul," he said. 
  The F-7 is the Chinese version of the Russian MiG-21, the 
mainstay of the India Air Force. The PAF has reportedly bought 
some 60 F-7 Ms and 80 F-7Ps. The former is the upgraded export 
version of the F-7 while the latter meets the specific 
requirements of the PAF with 24 major and minor modifications 
over the standard export model. The improvements made by the 
PAF interalia include the ability to carry four air-to-air 
missiles instead of two and the installation of Martin Baker 
Pk-10LZ ejection seats. 
  The F-7s need overhauling after every 600 hours of flying. 
This factory was established with the idea to develop an 
in-country capability to rebuild aircraft since the aircraft 
otherwise would have to be sent to China for overhaul. This not 
only would have cost heavily in foreign exchange but also the 
average aircraft availability would have greatly reduced since 
the turnaround time from China was between 18-24 months as 
against 7-8 months in Pakistan. That also implied that either 
the aircraft were unavailable in emergencies or the PAF had to 
keep their replacements. Needless to stress, both the options 
were very expensive and time consuming. 
  Now, because of the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, the PAF 
would get back the F-7 aircraft sent for the overhaul to Kamra 
in the shortest-possible timeframe specially during crisis. 
Also, the highly skilled manpower of the PAC would be available 
to augment the present resources of the PAF in case of national 
emergencies and war. The director general said that the 
Pakistan Aeronautical Complex had also been successful in 
producing 500 and 800 litre supersonic drop tanks for the F-7s. 
They are in addition to 1,140 litre auxiliary fuel tanks which 
the factory made for the F-6s. These drop tanks have 
considerably increased the endurance and range of the aircraft. 
  The F-6RF has successfully over-hauled more than 294 Chinese 
origin aircraft of various types for the Pakistan Air Force 
since its establishment. It also makes some 10,000 parts of 
F-6s, FT-6s, FT-5s and A-5IIIs for providing maintenance support 
to the aircraft. 
  The four PAC factories -- the F-6 Rebuild Factory, the 
Mirage 
Rebuild Factory (MRF), the Aircraft Manufacturing Factory (AMF) 
and the Kamra Avionics and Radar Factory (KARF) -- employ around 
5,000 people and have, over the years, saved Rs10 billion in 
foreign exchange. That speaks volumes about the necessity for 
indigenisation of defence industries in Pakistan.

  [Text] The former Reserve Bank of India governor, Mr. R.N. 
Malhotra, has said that the committee headed by him has 
recommended privatization of the insurance business only to 
protect the interests of the insuring public. In an interview 
to PTI, he asserted that the U.S. threat to retaliate against 
India if it did not open up its insurance industry did not weigh 
with the committee. He said that opening up the insurance sector 
would lead to better service by existing companies and also by 
the new entrants.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Sino-Pakistan Link"] </F>
  [Text] Chinese friendship has been an important factor in 
Pakistan's foreign policy from two points of view in the last 
thirty years. First, every government in Islamabad has sought 
Chinese help in procuring military hardware and nuclear know-how 
and materials with varying degrees of success. Secondly, the 
Pakistanis have naturally attached the greatest importance to 
eliciting significant Chinese diplomatic support for its case on 
Kashmir. Benazir Bhutto's visit to Beijing has made hardly any 
difference to bilateral ties from either point of view. As far 
as the first objective is concerned, the Pakistan Prime 
Minister's talks with Premier Li Peng have not produced any 
dramatic result. None of the five documents on cooperation 
signed on this occasion relates to military items although the 
Pakistan Defence Minister, Aftab Shaban Mirani, along with the 
Foreign and Commerce Ministers, were present at the talks 
between the two delegations led by the PMs. It is not clear 
whether this is because Mirani, who was in Beijing three weeks 
ago also, had already transacted military business. The 
possibility of significant military purchases from China cannot, 
of course, be ruled out. If the two sides have decided to carry 
on covert business in this field, that is the established 
pattern all over the world. 
  In terms of the requirements of Pakistan's current 
diplomacy, 
a new helpful gesture by China, on Kashmir was actually far more 
important to Benazir Bhutto. She has not achieved this purpose. 
Li Peng merely reiterated the known Chinese stand that India 
and Pakistan should resolve this question "through patient 
dialogue" and "welcomed efforts conducive to a settlement". 
This advice cannot have been sweet music to the visiting lady's 
ears. It is hardly distinguishable from what the Simla 
Agreement enjoins India and Pakistan to do. As is well know, 
Islamabad pays only lip-service to this agreement while moving 
heaven and earth to sabotage it in practice. The lesson to be 
drawn, therefore, is that the Chinese connection is unlikely to 
give Pakistan more diplomatic manoeuverability than hitherto. 
In a notable amplification of China's present policy on 
Kashmir, the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, Li Ruihuan, during his recent visit to 
New Delhi, had also condemned terrorism in any form. 
  The sooner the Pakistani policy-makers realise the futility 
of concentrating on enlisting the support of other countries for 
its claim to Kashmir instead of reaching an amicable settlement 
with India, the better it will be for regional peace and 
stability. To reject such a shift in the face of the demands of 
the new international situation will be to cling to a world of 
make-believe. The challenge before Benazir Bhutto is to lead 
her people not back into the dreary past, but towards a 
reassuring future.

  [Text] The Youth Congress-I workers today courted arrest 
near the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi protesting 
against the reported statement of the Pakistani foreign minister 
that a nuclear war may engulf South Asia if the India-Pakistan 
territorial dispute remains unresolved. A memorandum submitted 
to a representative of the high commission said the best way to 
resolve the dispute over Kashmir is through direct discussions 
between the governments of India and Pakistan as envisaged under 
the Simla Agreement. The Youth Congress-I also urged Pakistan 
to refrain from making provocative statements in the future if 
it wishes to maintain peace in South Asia. Islamabad should 
also stop interfering in India's internal affairs, the 
memorandum said.

  [Text] India has protested to Bangladesh for allowing 
Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI [Inter-Service 
Intelligence], to operate from its land. New Delhi's concern 
was conveyed by the director general of BSF [Border Security 
Force], Mr. Prakash Singh, at the two-day India-Bangladesh 
coordination meeting which concluded in the capital yesterday. 
The Bangladesh delegation was led by the director general of 
Bangladesh Rifles, Mohammad Anwar Hussain. A BSF spokesman said 
that India also raised the issue of support being received by 
insurgent groups of the Northeast. The question of illegal 
immigration from Bangladesh was also raised at the meeting with 
India insisting that the 1991 agreement at the home secretary 
level should be implemented to sort out the problem. 
  As already reported, both India and Bangladesh agreed at the 
meeting to coordinate their efforts to check smuggling. The two 
sides also decided to undertake delineation of 50 kms of 
undemarcated border. The work on repair and maintenance of 
border pillars along the international border is to be taken up 
with the security forces of the two countries. 
  The BSF spokesman said that both India and Bangladesh have 
agreed that security forces should observe utmost restraint in 
the disputed Muharichar area and take demarcation of the border 
in the 1.6 km stretch immediately.

  [Text] In Jammu and Kashmir, the militancy has declined 
after the Hazratbal [shrine] crisis. This was stated by the 
general officer commanding in chief of the Northern Command, 
Lieutenant General Surendra Singh, while addressing a press 
conference at Udhampur yesterday. He said the militants are 
feeling demoralized. Infighting among the militant groups is 
also a cause of their frustration. The general said the 
situation in the state is under control. He, however, did not 
rule out sporadic incidents of violence or killings by the 
militants to create tension. He said the so-called strongholds 
of militants, like Sopor and some other parts in the valley, 
have been cleared and the people are now heaving a sigh of 
relief.

<F P=106> ["OANA/pool" item; all quotation marks as received] </F>
  [Text] Colombo, 14 Jan (LANKAPUVATH) -- Army commander 
Lieutenant General Gerry De Silva said Thursday [13 January] 
that he is confident that Sri Lanka's security forces will 
defeat the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] and force the 
terrorist organisation to lay down arms and accept a settlement 
on terms laid down by the government, despite the LTTE being 
stronger today than they ever were before. 
  The Army commander in an interview with LANKAPUVATH said the 
best form of defence was offensive action. He said there are no 
stops. Once launched into battle, it has to be decisive. 
  "The offensive action against the LTTE consists of two 
things. The short term and the long term. The short term action 
is on already, except that we have been put back by the floods 
that are prevailing now (on the battlefront)." 
  He said that with regard to long term plans, "as soon as 
possible we will go ahead and it will be a long term big 
offensive. This offensive, he said, would be launched with the 
idea of defeating the LTTE without there being any stops. He 
said: "I don't think there will be any stops. Once you launch 
into battle it has to be decisive. 
  The Army commander said 14 new battalions, 700 to 1,000 men 
in each, would be sent to the battlefront, soon. 
  He said the Sri Lankan soldier was a fighting soldier. 
  "We have been fighting (the LTTE) for over 10 years without 
a 
break. Unfortunately, the Sri Lanka Army has had to deploy its 
entire bayonet strength without respite. It has been a big 
strain on the Sri Lankan soldier. But despite all odds and very 
trying circumstances, he has come out of it on top. I pay 
tribute to our soldiers for having fought for so long and so 
well." 
  Lt. Gen. De Silva said that nowhere else in the world was a 
soldier deployed continuously for very long periods without a 
turnaround in troops, a period of rest and recuperation. 
Usually soldiers were required to serve only three to six 
months on the battlefront. There had been no time for proper 
training. This and many other problems will be solved. 
  He said that initially, the Army had made the mistake of 
stretching and holding on to real estate which in some cases was 
not that vital. 
  The Army commander said that the offensive capability of the 
Army was being brought up to levels as required in professional 
Army. 
  He said the Army was being rebuilt and restructured after 
recent setbacks which have caused worry to the people of this 
country as well as the government. He was happy to state that 
when the toured the battlefront a few days ago, he saw smiling 
faces. 
  The fighting spirit, motivation and professionalism, new 
thinking, planning, new concepts, restructuring , reorganising, 
hand picking field commanders for proper leadership required to 
win the war, infusion of military hardware more suited to meet 
requirements of the current ground conditions which will give 
greater mobility and fighting capability to the soldier, and the 
introduction of new concepts are some of the matters which are 
being urgently dealt with. 
  He said he will not place a time frame. Invariably, you get 
caught up with and boxed in. An enemy reacts to a time frame, 
he said. 
  With regard to battlefield casualties caused by terrorist 
mines, Lt. Gen. De Silva said that most of the casualties have 
occurred by troops dropping their guard and not carrying out the 
drills correctly and they get caught up in mine explosions. 
  He said that the LTTE were now using Johnny mine explosions 
to detonate a chain of larger, powerful Claymore mines. 
  As a counter to landmines, the purchase of vehicles with 
ploughs attached in front of the tank tracks, was beijing 
seriously considered. 
  These matters were being dealt with on a top priority basis. 
  Lt. Gen. De Silva said that the bunkerline concept can be 
done away with and replaced with more tactical forward defense 
localities which could encompass not only the bunkerliners but 
the areas forward of them also. There should be also early 
warning elements and obstacles built to prevent waves of 
terrorists attacking the bunkerlines and to break up their 
momentum. These obstacles can be used as a killing ground to 
inflict maximum casualties on terrorists. 
  In response to a question as to how strong the LTTE was 
operationally, the Army commander said they (the LTTE) have 
never been as strong as they are today, in the sense that first 
of all their capability to take on even large camps. Next would 
be the change of tactics or earlier practise of hitting camps, 
attacking with smaller numbers. Today we find large 
concentrations of force on isolated camps. They have put in 
everything and coordinated and well controlled and we see a mix 
of their land operations and sea borne operations to have a 
telling effect. 
  The LTTE have been well trained and devised certain 
(?drills) 
to meet up with capabilities in offensive as well as in defence 
postures. 
  The LTTE, he said, also have effective drills to counter 
tank 
capabilities. There has been a lot of thinking done on their 
part. It has brought them a lot of success. 
  The LTTE has shown a very high degree of training. There has 
been no numerical increase, but the LTTE had enhanced their 
strength such as in the Sea Tiger capability where women are 
playing a prominent role.

  [Text] Sharjah, 13 January, KUNA -- In a press statement 
issued here today, the first deputy prime minister and minister 
of foreign affairs, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, stressed the success 
of the State of Kuwait on all fronts with regard to the 
protection of its sovereignty and independence. He refused to 
say that concluding defense treaties with the great powers meant 
Kuwait's failure on the Arab and Gulf fronts. 
  In a statement to the weekly magazine AL-SHURUQ, he said: 
"Everybody knows that all the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] 
member-states put the lives of their sons at risk to liberate 
Kuwait. We are still, after the liberation, going ahead with 
coordinating joint defense among the GCC states, which proves 
that cooperation among them is successful". 
  On the Arab front, he added: "There are Arab countries which 
participated in the liberation war, such as Egypt and Syria," 
pointing out that this coordination had continued later on 
within the framework of the Damascus Declaration, which includes 
these two countries alongside the six GCC states. 
  Shaykh Sabah denied the existence of external pressure on 
the 
State of Kuwait regarding the direction of its policy, pointing 
out that the recent visits of Western personalities to Baghdad 
were made for a specific reason, namely the release of Western 
hostages imprisoned by the Iraqi regime. 
  He stressed the continuation of the isolation of the Iraqi 
regime for its refusal to comply with all UN resolutions in 
connection with its aggression on the State of Kuwait, pointing 
out that: "No country could extend its bridges to a regime which 
inflicts starvation and homelessness to its people and practices 
the most cruel torture against it". 
  Shaykh al-Sabah denied the allegations that Kuwait's 
statements calling for distinction to be made between the Iraqi 
regime and the Iraqi people were in variance with actual 
practices, and stressed that Kuwait had helped the Iraqi people 
with food and medicine, particularly those expelled by the Iraqi 
regime in the north and in the south to whom humanitarian aid 
was sent. He further said: We do make a distinction between the 
regime and the people and it does not please us at all to hear 
about a fraternal people beset by hunger and poverty. 
  On whether he expected success in forthcoming days to 
efforts 
days aimed at bringing about a reconciliation with the adversary 
states that supported Iraq in its aggression against the state 
of Kuwait, Shaykh al-Sabah asked: On what basis would these 
efforts succeed and reconciliation be brought about. 
  He added: First, the problem must end, and then 
reconciliation begins, but if reconciliation comes now, it would 
be absolutely useless. Kuwait has, in fact, specified the 
conditions for a reconciliation with the adversary states to the 
effect that these states must announce their recognition of the 
UN Security Council resolutions pertaining to the Iraqi 
aggression against Kuwait. 
  In his statement, the Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister 
and 
foreign minister expressed the hope that harmony would prevail 
and all the accumulations resulting from the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait would disappear. The invasion, he said, had frozen 
everything, including peace which he hoped would be realized. 
He further said: So long as differences exist in the Arab 
world, everything will remain suspended and frozen. 
  In his assessment of the current events regarding the Arab- 
Israeli settlement, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said: "We welcomed the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement as a first step." He added that 
he "hopes that this step will lead to an agreement in all 
processes, otherwise there will not be any progress towards 
peace." 
  Regarding the GCC's failure to reach a total union so far 
along the lines of the European Maastricht Treaty, Shaykh Sabah 
said: "The European Council is over 50 years old and despite 
this it has not taken its final shape yet. By contrast the Gulf 
Cooperation Council was created only 14 years ago." He added: 
"It is true that we have not realized all the hopes pinned on 
the Council, but we should not ignore the fact that many of 
these have been realized." He further said: "We all hope to 
achieve the remaining aspirations in the coming years." 
  In reply to a question on whether he thought that the 
success of the GCC as a formula for regional cooperation was due 
to a weakening of the Arab League's role, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad 
indicated that the Cooperation Council did not come from outside 
the framework of the Arab League, but that it had been set 
within the framework of the Arab League Charter which stipulates 
that Arab countries should cooperate among themselves. 
  He also stated that the Council continued to play its part 
in 
reinforcing the Arab League and making its role more effective. 
He added that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the state of 
disunion and division which ensued led to a fragmentation of the 
Arab decision. He also deplored the fact that this had led to 
the weakening of the role of the Arab League to the point of 
marginalization.

  [Text] Iraq has affirmed that the comprehensive embargo 
imposed on it has lost its legitimacy and, therefore, must be 
lifted. In a press release issued by the Iraqi UN mission 
yesterday, Iraq hoped that the next review of the embargo will 
reflect the progress that has taken place thanks to the 
cooperation between Iraq and the Special Committee and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], rather than the 
political purposes of some UN Security Council member states. 
  The Iraqi press release noted that everyone has come to 
realize that some UN Security Council member states, 
particularly the United States and Britain, are trying to impose 
their political views on the UN Security Council's decision 
during the next review of the embargo. 
  The press release hopes again that the review scheduled for 
early next week will reflect the international community's real 
desire for lifting the blockade in light of the progress that 
has been made during recent months. 
  The statement says that if the blockade is lifted, this will 
prove that the positive steps and success that have taken place 
have had a positive effect on the UN Security Council's 
decision, especially after the Special Commission and the IAEA 
have considered Iraq's acceptance of Resolution 715 on 26 
November 1993 a major step which has resulted in removing the 
remaining obstacle before Iraq's compliance with its obligations 
in accordance with Part C of Resolution 687. 
  The Iraqi mission's press release explained that the 
continued embargo will not serve the credibility of the United 
Nations, as the only result of continuing the embargo will be 
continued suffering by the Iraqi people. Recent statistics have 
shown that 400,000 Iraqi citizens, including 140,000 children 
under five, have died since the embargo was imposed, and which 
resulted in the scarcity of food and health supplies.

  [Excerpt] The prime minister has already left the Labor

promised was not delivered for lack of time, but emerging from 
the meeting, the prime minister answered reporters' questions on 
the upcoming summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, slated to be held in Geneva on 
16 January. The prime minister was not optimistic: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] I do not know exactly what will take 
place there. Unfortunately, I do not anticipate Syria showing 
greater flexibility on the matter of the price it is demanding 
for peace with Israel. It may show greater flexibility on the 
matter of the nature of peace, but we will only know that after 
the encounter. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] Gentlemen, hour by hour, next Sunday's [16 
January] historic summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and 
Bill Clinton in Geneva draws greater Arab, regional, and 
international attention. Everyone is awaiting this pivotal 
event in the peace process. The results of this summit will 
definitely make major headlines in the region for a long time to 
come. Perhaps the great attention given to the Geneva summit 
primarily stems from the interest in the need to achieve peace 
in the Middle East, a peace that is considered an international 
demand more than it is a domestic or regional demand. [passage 
omitted]. 
  We will not be divulging a secret if we say that we agree 
with the U.S. Administration on many points, most prominent of 
which is the need to achieve a comprehensive peace, admitting 
that separate and partial deals do not bring a real, viable, and 
durable peace, that peace can only be achieved through the 
restoration of the territory and ending the occupation, that the 
Syrian and Lebanese tracks are two integrated tracks without 
which the peace process cannot be completed, and that stability 
in the region is important, vital, and essential for world 
security. Such security can only be achieved through the 
establishment of a just, comprehensive peace based on the 
international legitimacy and UN resolutions. Many points of 
disagreement notwithstanding, the points mentioned above were 
behind Syria's readiness to cooperate with the former Bush 
administration and the present Clinton administration to make 
the peace process successful and to remove obstacles from its 
path. 
  For over two years, Syria has been making every sincere and 
honest effort in this context. This has enhanced respect for 
Syria, increased its importance, and boosted its stands, not 
only in the eyes of the world, but also in the eyes of the 
decisionmakers in the U.S. Administration in particular, who 
planned the Geneva summit as recognition and acknowledgement of 
Syria's role and of President Hafiz al-Asad's decisive role in 
the peace process. This Syrian- U.S. cooperation exists and 
will continue as long the U.S. Administration is committed to 
the peace process and as long as it is interested in its success 
in accordance with the assurances, guarantees, and principles on 
the basis of which it has been launched. This cooperation is 
apt to yield good fruits in the Geneva summit if the Clinton 
administration shoulders its responsibility seriously and 
effectively to convince the Israeli rulers to comply with the 
terms of peace and to fully withdraw from the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  There is no problem with Syria, which has accepted the peace 
process and its bases and worked to make it successful. The 
problem lies in the stands of the Israeli rulers, who, up to 
this moment, reject the bases of this process. Furthermore, 
they are working to marginalize this process. They are 
tampering with its tracks and distorting it through secret 
contacts and vague and incomplete agreements. 
  Out of our interest in the peace process, we in Syria are 
greatly hoping that the Geneva summit will yield positive 
results which will open the way for the peace process and will 
remove the traps that the Israeli rulers have placed in its way. 
By all yardsticks, it is an exceptional chance for the Clinton 
administration to rectify the situation, improve the atmosphere 
in the region, make real peace in the Middle East, and prove the 
credibility of the United States as the sole superpower which 
has a historic responsibility toward the achievement of peace 
and security for peoples of the world. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali this morning 
received at Carthage palace Mr. Manuel Marin, the first vice 
president of the European Commission in charge of cooperation 
policy for development. 
  Following the meeting, the European official said that his 
talk with the president was important and extremely useful and 
was characterized by openness, pointing out that this was due to 
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's clear and far-sighted political views 
towards Tunisia's relations with the Mediterranean region, in 
general, and with the European Union [EU]. He expressed 
happiness for the forthcoming start of negotiations with Tunisia 
over the new partnership agreement between our country and the 
EU, hoping that during the second half of this year, a final 
partnership formula would be reached. 
  Mr. Manuel Marin made clear that technical consultations 
will 
take place between the two sides in order to look into "the 
terms appropriate to the Tunisian economy which we should 
respect," saying that "if the final formula is the free exchange 
which has great importance to the Tunisian economy and its 
future, we should also acknowledge the need for the Tunisian 
economy to be adequate to the new framework of cooperation in 
the best of ways. In conclusion he expressed confidence for the

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador to Turkey Mohammad Reza Baqeri by </F>
an unidentified KEYHAN correspondent in Ankara; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Baqeri] Iran and Turkey have many 
characteristics in common. They have a long history, and their 
relations have been marked by continuing and numerous changes, 
in which extraneous elements have constantly had a negative and, 
at times, a destructive effect. 
  Look at the history of these two countries. In the Ottoman 
era, despite both having a religious government and many common 
denominators, foreign elements took advantage of the minor 
differences between them by pitting one against the other. 
[passage omitted] 
  Westerners know that Turkey's population is 99 percent 
Muslim, and the people are devout and follow Islamic traditions. 
However, by propagating non-Islamic signs or anti-Islamic 
phenomena and fanning nationalism, they are portraying Iran as a 
disruptive and dangerous element opposed to Turkey. We perceive 
the same scenario being repeated in our relations with Turkey 
regarding the newly liberated Central Asian republics. 
  Intense propaganda is giving the impression that Iran and 
Turkey are at loggerheads and that in Turkey a lay government is 
in charge, while Iran has an Islamic government. So, foreign 
elements seek to play a destructive role. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] How are relations now? 
  [Baqeri] We have cordial cultural, economic, and political 
relations and recently initiated security cooperation. If we 
look at Turkey and its neighbors, we see that it has problems 
with all of them; that is, with Iraq, Syria, southern Cyprus, 
Greece, Bulgaria, and Armenia. I have urged Turkish newspapers 
to heed the anti-Iranian material that is disseminated, as it 
could give the impression that all the neighbors have strained 
relations with Turkey. We believe that relations can be 
cordial. Dr. Habibi's visit to Turkey was also very successful 
and agreements were reached on bilateral issues. Some transport 
problems we had with Turkey were eliminated during this visit. 
  When it came to the passage of trucks and passengers from 
Syria, Turkish officials created problems for pilgrims to holy 
sites, so Iran imposed restrictions on the Turkish trucks. The 
issue was resolved in a friendly manner and there are no 
restrictions on the passage of trucks or Iranian passenger 
buses. We asked them not to harass the passengers, as we are 
obliged to assist the Iranian passengers. 
  [Correspondent] How do you appraise the outcome of this 
visit? 
  [Baqeri] Prime Minister Ciller played a very active, 
positive, and cordial role in these talks. We have women prime 
ministers in our Eastern and Western neighboring countries; that 
is, in Turkey and Pakistan, but both fortunately have very 
friendly relations with Irand. This indicates that the Islamic 
Republic has no problems with female heads of government. We 
hope to see extremely positive developments following the visit 
by Dr. Habibi. 
  Two ministers accompanying Dr. Habibi met their Turkish 
counterparts and some agreements were reached. Soon, we hope to 
witness Demirel's visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran at the 
invitation of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  The outlook for our bilateral relations is extremely 
positive, but because Turkey and Iran have common enemies and 
foreign elements do not favor broadening Iranian-Turkish 
relations, the Turkish mass media as well as its officials 
should heed this point; that is, our enemies will capitalize on 
any difference between Iran and Turkey. We should give them no 
such pretext.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Sumith Chakroberty] </F>
  [Text] While the world media continue to focus on the 
problems of economic reforms in Russia dominating the 
U.S.-Russian summit talks in the Kremlin, the U.S. President, 
Mr. Bill Clinton, and his Russian counterpart, Mr. Boris 
Yeltsin, have taken yet another major step toward consolidating 
international peace. The two presidents have reached an 
agreement to end the targeting of their long-range nuclear 
missiles at each other. Skeptics had been prompt to point to 
the infirmities in the accord. Besides mentioning the 
difficulties involved in carrying it out, they have pointed out 
that the whole exercise could be easily reprogrammed to return 
to the old position of aiming at each other. However, what is 
being forgotten is that despite numerous problems afflicting 
U.S.-Russian relations today, Russia as well as the other 
constituents of the former Soviet Union have along with the 
United States firmly set themselves on a course of nuclear 
disarmament which is practically irreversible. Both the 
intermediate nuclear forces treaty evolved at the 
Reagan-Gorbachev summit in December 1987 in Washington and the 
Strategtic Arms Reduction Treaty, START-II, arrived at in 
January last year in Moscow during the last Bush-Yeltsin summit 
have provided sufficient testimony of that course. In fact, 
such a course signifies the final burial of the cold war, 
conclusive evidence of which is offered by the latest accord. 
  Perhaps, more striking is Mr. Leonid Kravchuk, the president 
of Ukraine, joining Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin in Moscow to 
attest their signatures on an agreement envisaging the 
destruction of the nuclear arsenal in Ukraine's possession. 
This arsenal of 1,900 warheads is the world's third largest 
after those of the United States and Russia. This accord too 
has generated a lot of skepticism, fuelled as it is by the rise 
of nationalist sentiments in the various republics of the 
erstwhile USSR threatening to nullify the essence of whatever 
has been achieved. Nevertheless, while not being blind to such 
an eventuality, it is necessary to underline that these fears 
are exaggerated, precisely when the public opinion in Russia and 
other member states of the former Soviet Union is for protection 
of their national interests alongside economic development and 
national regeneration for which reinforcement of peace through 
nuclear disarmament constituents an essential precondition. Mr. 
Clinton has emphasized the U.S.-Russian role in promoting 
European security. 
  The agreements about to be concluded in Moscow are of 
far-reaching nature and would, therefore, actually exert a 
powerful positive influence on global security in general, far 
beyond the borders of the European continent. They are also in 
full conformity with the Indian action plan for disarmament 
spelt out by the late Rajiv Gandhi at the third special session 
of the UN on disarmament.

<F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Hasan 'Asfur, a senior Palestinian negotiator 
involved in the Taba negotiations, has said in a telephone 
conversation with AL-RA'Y that he, along with Major General 
'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya and Muhammad Dahlan, have, for the past 
three days, been preparing for the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations, which will resume in Taba tomorrow. 
  'Asfur affirmed that "this team has not left Taba since the 
halt in the negotiations on Wednesday [12 January]." 
  'Asfur denied that "there are secret talks between the 
Palestinians and Israelis," affirming that "the talks have been 
halted, and that they will resume tomorrow, Monday, as agreed." 
  'Asfur hoped that progress will be made in the negotiations 
that will be resumed in Taba tomorrow, affirming that "the 
Palestinian side rejects Israeli pressures, which are aimed at 
extricating concessions." 
  'Asfur added: "We have submitted a compromise to the Israeli 
side on the issue of the border crossings with Jordan and Egypt, 
one that falls in line with the spirit of the Declaration of 
Principles, and heeds Israeli external security, as well." 
  'Asfur went on to say: "We are awaiting the Israelis' 
response in the next round of the Taba negotiations." He 
affirmed the Palestinian side's "commitment to the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles." 
  The Palestinian official affirmed that "coordination between 
the Palestinians and Israelis on the border crossings must 
involve the entire border crossings; that is, from the entrance 
to the crossing up to the territories that will fall under the 
jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority." 
  With regard to the size of the Jericho area, 'Asfur said 
that 
"the Palestinian side is insisting that it include populated 
areas as well as historical and religious sites." All these, he 
noted, must be under the jurisdiction of the future Palestinian 
authority. 
  As for the issue of settlements, this is a complicated 
issue, 
he said. "However, we hope that we will make progress towards a 
resolution of this issue," he added. 
  The negotiations which started on Monday were halted on 
Wednesday evening so that the head of the Israeli delegation to 
the negotiations could take part in the funeral of Nehemya 
Tamari, commander of the Central Command, who was killed when 
his helicopter crashed north of occupied Jerusalem on the night 
of 11-12 January. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th has said that 35 percent of the civilian 
issues discussed have been finalized. The two delegations are 
yet to address the issues of water problems, planning, and 
preparations on the ground, not to mention the construction of 
housing units.

  [Text] Taba, 16 Jan (MENA)--The Palestinian Israeli talks 
in Taba have been postponed for 24 hours for technical reasons. 
They will resume on Tuesday [18 January] instead of tomorrow. 
  Hasan 'Asfur, the head of the Security Committee emanating 
from the Gaza-Jericho Committee, says the postponement is 
because Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's 
political adviser, is in Tunis, where he is briefing the 
Palestinian leadership on the course of the negotiations and the 
obstacles facing them. 'Asfur added that the coming round of 
talks is expected to last until Friday. The discussion during 
the coming round, he added, will focus on issues that are the 
subject of differences between the two sides, primarily the area 
of Jericho, the control of the crossing points, and the control 
of the border points between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho 
and the West Bank. 
  At its last meeting, the Palestinian-Israeli Security 
Committee ran into difficulties due to differences in views over 
issues relating to Jericho, the security of the settlements, and 
the crossing points. 
  As for the Civilian Committee, progress was made on the 
transfer of civilian powers to the Palestinians in the areas of 
services and infrastructure. Some points relating to water, 
archaeology, and town planning remain to be solved in the coming 
round.

focus on security issues. 
  Our correspondent notes that last night the PLO leadership 
held a debate on the results of the Taba negotiations. The 
participants received a report from Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the chief 
Palestinian delegate. The Taba talks are slated to resume

  [Text] Taba, 17 Jan (MENA)--Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the 
Palestinian team at the Palestinian-Israeli Civilian Committee, 
a subcommittee of the Gaza-Jericho talks, has told MENA that the 
Palestinians and Israelis have not reached agreement on 18 
points concerning the transfer of civilian authority, services, 
and public facilities from the Israelis to the Palestinians in 
accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles. 
  The Palestinians and Israelis, however, agreed on 20 points 
in the last round of talks. These, al-Tarifi added, include 
education, health, social affairs, electricity, and postal 
services. The points on which no agreement have been reached 
include taxes, tariffs, city planning, and water supply. The 
talks, which will resume tomorrow in Taba, will focus on these 
unresolved issues, he pointed out. 
  The Palestinian people have a big problem concerning water, 
because Israeli settlements are exhausting the water resources 
in the occupied territories, particularly Gaza. Only these 
settlements, al-Tarifi said, are allowed to dig for water. The 
Palestinians are not, he noted. 
  Al-Tarifi said: We insist on our right to issue Palestinian 
passports and ID's. The Israeli side does not agree to the 
issuance of a Palestinian passport on the grounds that it is a 
mark of state sovereignty and therefore unacceptable. 
  Al-Tarifi said that the Palestinians can exercise civilian 
authority successfully and without technical or administrative 
glitches. There are already Palestinian employees working for 
and running the civilian services and departments. Al-Tarifi 
pointed out that the number of Palestinian teachers and 
employees working in the education sector in the occupied 
territories amounts to 6,800 people, compared with 150 Israelis. 
We only want them to give us the files and computer data. We 
can run life in the West Bank and Gaza on our own.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq </F>
al-Yahya, head of the Palestinian team to the 
Palestinian-Israeli Security Committee, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place 
and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, 
head of the Security Committee: The PLO leadership held 
consultations during the past two days. Has the Palestinian 
delegation to the Taba negotiations received any new 
instructions regarding tomorrow 's resumption of the Taba 
negotiations? 
  [Al-Yahya] Yes. We and the Israeli side have agreed to 
resume the second round of negotiations in Taba tomorrow 
morning. I hope that during this round, we will be able to make 
some progress on the security issue. 
  [Mu'addi] Has the Palestinian delegation received special 
instructions from the PLO leadership on the resumption of these 
negotiations? 
  [Al-Yahya] Yes. We received instructions this morning. The 
Israeli side was contacted on this issue. We only hope that 
this time negotiations will be successful and productive. 
  [Mu'addi] Will tomorrow's negotiations in Taba also cover 
the 
topics listed on the agenda of the Civic Committee? 
  [Al-Yahya] Yes. The negotiations will also cover the work of 
the Civic Committee. 
  [Mu'addi] What are the topics listed on the agenda of the 
Security Committee? 
  [Al-Yahya] It might be correct to say that all issues are 
listed. So far, we have not agreed on any particular issues. 
  [Mu'addi] What about the topics on the agenda of the Civic 
Committee? 
  [Al-Yahya] During the past round, some progress was 
achieved. 
We hope that progress will continue in the same pattern. 
  [Mu'addi] In light of the consultations that were held with 
the PLO leadership, do you believe that it is possible to 
overcome the obstacles and reach an agreement on security issues 
during this round of negotiations? 
  [Al-Yahya] Everything is possible. I believe that this issue 
depends more on the Israeli side than on the Palestinian side. 
  [Mu'addi] Are there any new proposals or compromises with 
respect to the pending security issues: Control of the 
crossings and the size of the Jericho region? 
  [Al-Yahya] So far, there are no compromises. But I hope that 
during this round, we will be able to achieve some progress. 
This round is supposed to continue until Friday [21 January]. 
  [Mu'addi] Will tomorrow's negotiations in Taba take place 
within the general committee or within the subcommittees of 
negotiations? 
  [Al-Yahya] Negotiations will be held within the framework of 
both the subcommittees and the general committee. To explain, 
there are now two drafting committees, one on security issues, 
the other is civilian. There is also a general drafting 
committee which covers all topics and which will draft a final 
formula of the major agreement and its security and civilian 
appendixes. 
  [Mu'addi] Maj. Gen. 'Abd-al-Razzaq a-Yahya, head of the 
Security Committee, many thanks. 
  [Al-Yahya] Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Jan (MENA)-- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chairman of 
the Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli meetings 
to implement the Gaza-Jericho First Agreement, has accused the 
Israeli side of trying to obstruct the progress of negotiations 
during the first week of the Taba talks. 
  He told MENA that this obstruction was very clear in the 
Israeli statements before and during the meeting. He believes 
that this might have been due to the fact that the Israelis are 
waiting for the outcome of the al-Asad-Clinton summit meeting, 
or probably because the Palestinians refused to accept the Cairo 
document as a pure agreement, as the Israelis wanted it to be. 
  The Palestinian official noted that the Labor Party is 
pursuing the same policy and approach that Likud formerly used. 
I believe that we can overcome all the difficulties if all the 
parties show good will, he said, adding: We are willing to do 
that. 
  Sha'th said that 'Arafat dreams of a free and independent 
Palestine, just like everyone else. We know that this is not 
the right time. We agreed to and committed ourselves to 
negotiations to find a solution for a transitional period. This 
means that we know that the time is not ripe yet for an 
independent state, he said. 
  The Palestinian official pointed out that the establishment 
of an independent state requires, first of all, an agreement on 
self-government in Gaza and Jericho, then in the entire West 
Bank. After that there can be negotiations concerning the 
independent state, he said. 
  Dr. Sha'th accused the Israeli negotiating delegation of 
demonstrating hypersensitivity concerning what they view as a 
symbol of sovereignty. 
  He affirmed that the Palestinian side does not seek to 
establish an independent Palestinian state at present but that 
the Israeli side sometimes takes an exaggerated view of the 
symbols of sovereignty and even the symbols of the Palestinian 
national identity, which the Palestinian people insist on 
establishing. As an example, he recalled that Palestinians used 
to be jailed for hoisting the Palestinian flag. 
  In his remarks, Sha'th pointed out that the Israelis do not 
want the Palestinian authority to have its own postal stamps 
because they take this as a symbol of sovereignty. 
  Postal stamps might represent some form of identity, but it 
is not an instrument of sovereignty, he said. He added that 
Israel does not want the Palestinian authority to have its own 
telephone area code or to join the International Auto Club, 
which Palestine was a member of until 1960. 
  As for the Palestinian currency, Sha'th explained that this 
issue was discussed by the Palestinian-Israeli committee in 
Paris. He noted that Scotland has its own currency even though 
it is not independent of the United Kingdom. 
  Sha'th emphasized that the Palestinian people deserve to 
have a national identity and to look forward to obtaining their 
right to freedom, independence, and equality. 
  Sha'th spoke about the first week of the current round of 
negotiations in Taba, which is scheduled to resume on Monday. 
He said: There were two battles during the first week of 
negotiations. The first was over whether or not there was a 
Cairo agreement and who had backed down from it. The second was 
over what the Israeli side had leaked regarding reaching an 
agreement with us on Jericho. It was a pure fabrication and they 
had to deny the same reports that they themselves had leaked. 
He added: We succeeded in making them announce that there was 
no document called the Cairo agreement, but rather a Cairo 
understanding. He added: The fact is that six different 
versions were written outlining what conclusions the Cairo talks 
had reached. One version contained seven reservations expressed 
by president 'Arafat and another included the reservations of 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Turning to next week's negotiations, the head of the 
Palestinian negotiating delegation noted that he had agreed with 
his Israeli counterpart Major General Amnon Shahaq to start the 
negotiations on Monday with a discussion of the structure of the 
final agreement as the first item on the agenda. He added: We 
will meet in three committees. The civilian committee, which 
envisages concluding its work next week; the general drafting 
committee; and the security committee. He noted that the only 
items on the agenda of the civilian committee are archaeology, 
water, urban planning, and land registration, both the state 
land and the land of absentees [al-gha'ibin]. He noted that a 
problem arose within the civilian committee when Jamil 
al-Tarifi, head of the Palestinian delegation to the committee, 
objected to ending the discussion of civil registration in Gaza 
without discussing Jericho, which is part of the West Bank. It 
was agreed in this respect that when the negotiations on the 
West Bank start in the second stage, these three items [not 
further specified] will be added and an agreement will be 
signed, he added, noting that the Israelis wanted to separate 
the records of the Jericho area from those of the West Bank. 
  Sha'th pointed out that concerning the general agreement, 
there are two versions: One Israeli and one Palestinian. He 
added: We have to look at them once again to come up with a 
joint document. Sha'th added that the coordination measures had 
also been agreed upon. He noted that the Israeli side proposed 
a draft structure for coordination called the Higher 
Coordination Body, which appeared to parallel the Palestinian 
National Authority and which was to be divided into two 
subcommittees, one for Gaza and the other for Jericho. He 
added: The Palestinians managed to abrogate this body and only 
keep a liaison committee affiliated to the Palestinian National 
Authority -- similar to the liaison officers present at 
embassies for instance -- to resolve the problems that may arise 
between Palestinians and Israelis. 
  Asked what progress the security committee has made, Dr. 
Sha'th replied that difficulties persist. We have not made any 
progress because of the Israeli concept of security, he said. 
He remarked that the current negotiations represent a conflict 
between more Palestinian independence, freedom, and dignity on 
the one hand and Israel's eternal struggle for security. 
  Dr. Sha'th noted some progress concerning Gaza's security. 
The Israeli side presented to us a new map under which they 
give us back 8 square kilometers of land belonging to the 
Palestinians, in addition to 2.5 sq km of the Palestinian lands 
they had seized to build settlements and 3 sq km of Gush Qatif 
in southern Gaza, he said. He added that a further 4 sq km on 
the border with Egypt are expected to be returned as well. We 
have not obtained the latest map yet, he remarked. 
  Dr. Sha'th talked about the linking roads that will cross 
Gaza to connect the settlements to the main road to Israel. He 
noted that the two sides had agreed to set up joint 
Palestinian-Israeli patrols along these roads. He explained 
that Israel wanted to establish five military bases along this 
main road, in addition to seven fixed checkpoints to protect it. 
  In general, Dr. Sha'th stated that progress has been made 
concerning Gaza. He explained that the major points of 
disagreement right now are concentrated in the area of Jericho. 
All we have gotten in the whole area so far are 57 square 
kilometers, he said. 
  The Palestinian official noted that Jericho is regarded as 
part of the Old Israeli Alon plan, which the Israelis have not 
relinquished. He explained that the plan covered the city of 
Jerusalem and the surrounding settlements. It involved the 
establishment of settlements along the borders with Jordan, in 
what the Israelis call the defense line of their security zone 
on the East Bank to defend against Jordan and Iraq. He remarked 
that Jericho is included in that zone. He added that the 
Israelis ultimately want to keep Jerusalem, the Red Sea coast, 
and the Jordan River. 
  Sha'th said that the demands presented by president 'Arafat 
involved the Lido coastal area on the Dead Sea, the al-Maghtas 
area on the Jordan River, al-Qantal mountain, and al-Nabi Musa. 
  He added: We have secured a passage linking Jericho, 
al-'Awjah, 'Aqabat Jabr Camp, 'Ayn al-Sultan Camp, al-Duyuk 
village, al-Qarantal hill, and Musa al-'Alami farm. 
  He emphasized that the Palestinian negotiator will attempt 
to 
achieve three objectives that Egypt tried to achieve during the 
Camp David negotiations. He said that during those negotiations 
Egypt did not agree to leave one inch of its territory under 
Israeli occupation, did not agree for a single Israeli settler 
to remain after the Israeli withdrawal, and did not accept 
Israeli economic hegemony in the name of normalization. We, as 
Palestinian negotiators, must adhere to these three objectives, 
he said.

  [Text] Cairo, Jan 15 (MENA)-- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, advisor to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, left here this morning for 
Tunis to hand over a message from President Husni Mubarak to the 
Palestinian leader on Egypt's role in supporting the Palestinian 
cause. 
  In a pre-departure statement, Sha'th said that he will brief 
President 'Arafat on the development in the Taba talks between 
the Palestinians and Israelis. 
  Sha'th added that he will receive from 'Arafat his 
directives 
with regard to the coming round of the Palestinian-Israeli talks 
scheduled to be held on Monday. 
  Speaking about the coming round of talks, Sha'th voiced hope 
that the Israelis would not pose any obstacles before the 
negotiations. 
  On the coming summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, slated for tomorrow in Geneva, 
Dr. Sha'th expressed optimism over such a meeting, adding that 
it will open the door for Syria's return to the negotiations 
table. If Israel expressed readiness to fully withdraw from the 
Golan Heights, this would pave the way for Syria's return to the 
talks, he said. 
  Sha'th added that there is a Palestinian continuous drive in 
the peace process pointing out that 'Arafat met yesterday with 
the ambassadors of the U.S. and Russia in Tunis, the co-sponsors 
of the Middle East peace march. 
  Sha'th added that he had talks with the Norwegian foreign 
undersecretary, who stressed his country's support for the 
Palestinian cause and his readiness to offer any assistance to 
make the negotiations a success. 
  Sha'th will take part in the meetings of the PLO Executive 
Committee, due to open in Tunis today.

  [Text] Tunis, 17 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Taba talks, left Tunis for Cairo 
this evening after submitting a report to the Palestinian 
leadership about the results of the latest round of negotiations 
with the Israelis in Taba, which ended last Wednesday [12 
January]. 
  Before his departure, Sha'th said that the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks will be resumed in Taba on Tuesday 
morning. 
  Sha'th said he submitted to President 'Arafat and the other 
Palestinian leaders in Tunis a comprehensive report about the 
progress of the negotiations, especially in light of the problem 
that Israel caused with what it called "the Cairo agreement" 
between the two sides. This problem was solved when Egyptian 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, acting in the interest of the peace 
process, backed the Palestinian stance. 
  Dr. Sha'th added that the report he submitted to the 
Palestinian leadership included his expectations about the 
future of the Taba talks with the Israelis. He said that the 
Palestinian leaders held lengthy discussions on this issue, 
adding that he was given the necessary instructions about it. 
  Explaining his instructions, Sha'th said they included 
commitment to continuing the peace process and to achieving 
results on the specified dates so that there can be no 
retraction of the schedule set for withdrawal. He pointed out 
that the dates are an important part of the agreement. 
  Sha'th explained that Palestinian and Israeli negotiators in 
Taba are about to formulate a protocol of civilian powers in 
Gaza and Jericho in a process known as the transfer of powers to 
the Palestinian National Authority. 
  He announced: We are about to complete this protocol this 
week, indicating the transfer of all civilian powers to the 
Palestinian National Authority. 
  Sha'th noted that during the round of talks that will begin 
tomorrow the negotiators will focus on complex issues, including 
the border crossings, the size of the Jericho area, the Gaza 
settlements, and the presence of international forces, an 
important part of the Declaration of Principles. 
  Sha'th added: If we succeed in settling these issues, we 
will begin concentrating on the details of other security 
matters. 
  Sha'th described the Syrian-U.S. summit as a positive 
development that brings Syria back to the negotiating operation, 
something that is bound to help attain a comprehensive peace. 
He noted that Syria will be returning to the negotiations armed 
with a full commitment on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights and the restoration of Syrian sovereignty there. 
  Sha'th remarked that this is good for the peace process 
because it emphasizes an important precedent, namely that a real 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242 means full 
withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967. He 
pointed out that Egypt got as much in the Camp David accords. 
  He said Syria is now repeating the Egyptian achievement and 
the same will be applied to the Palestinian territories when 
negotiations over the final status are held. 
  Sha'th said that the Clinton-al-Asad meeting was useful as a 
precedent and was beneficial because it stressed the principle 
of comprehensiveness.

  [Text] Taba, 18 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has expressed 
the hope that the Syrian-U.S. summit will positively affect the 
peace process in the region. He pointed to the importance of 
Syria's participation in the ongoing peace efforts. 
  Arriving in Taba this morning to lead the Palestinian 
delegation to the meetings of the Gaza-Jericho Committee, Sha'th 
said the Palestinians want progress in every direction and on 
every track of the Arab-Israeli negotiations to achieve a 
comprehensive peace in the region. 
  Sha'th said that during the new round of talks, which will 
begin today, he and the Israeli delegation will discuss the 
border crossings, the size of the Jericho area, and the Israeli 
settlements in the Gaza Strip. He expressed the hope that 
topics relating to the transfer of civilian authority to the 
Palestinians will be wound up during this round. 
  He stressed that the Palestinian side has a real desire to 
negotiate during this round. He said he hoped the Israeli side 
has the same desire. He said the Palestinian stance has not 
changed, indicating that it is awaiting Israel's reply to the 
papers it presented earlier. 
  Dr. Sha'th noted that the Palestinians will participate in 
the coming round of Arab-Israeli talks in Washington, noting 
that there has been too much delay in resuming these talks. 
  Dr. Sha'th called for a quick transfer of power in the West 
Bank and for holding legislative elections in the occupied 
territories in July 1994. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the new round of talks in Taba was delayed 
because he was in Tunis, where he briefed the Palestinian 
leadership on the outcome of the last round of meetings of the 
Gaza-Jericho Committee. He stressed that any progress in the 
meetings of this committee will positively affect the meetings 
of the Economic Committee in Paris next week.

  Tehran, Jan. 16, IRNA -- Iran's Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati arrived in Geneva today to take part in the two-day 
meeting of foreign ministers of the contact group of the 
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) [ICO] to follow up U.N. 
measures to put an end to Serbs crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In the course of the session, to convene today, OIC foreign 
ministers, while putting emphasis on their past stands, would 
review latest developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
participants will also pledge their full support for the 
rightful stands and constructive, flexible role that Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic plays in the peace talks. The 
ministers will condemn Serbs crimes and blame the U.N. Security 
Council for failing to adopt a firm stand towards the 
establishment of peace in Bosnia and would call on the U.N. to 
make serious decisions in order to fulfil its humanitarian 
obligations. 
  Velayati, who takes part in the session at the invitation of 
President Izetbegovic and the OIC, will encourage the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference to hold an emergency 
session of foreign ministers of Islamic countries. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran, from the very beginning of the 
Serbs aggression, has supported the legitimate rights of the 
Bosnian Muslims and spent its diplomatic efforts over lifting 
arms embargo against Bosnia, halting illegal arms delivery to 
the Serbs, putting an end to the siege of Sarajevo and 
liberating the occupied lands.

  [Text] During the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] 
contact group session in Geneva today, our country's [Iran] 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati proposed that members of 
the contact group should visit Sarajevo in order to demonstrate 
the determination of the Islamic states to offer full support to 
the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Referring to the shortcomings of the international community 
in the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, he demanded a decisive 
response against the Serb aggressors and said: In view of the 
United Nations' failure to create safe havens, we once again ask 
the UN Security Council to dispatch troops from the Islamic 
countries to Bosnia as peacekeeping forces. 
  Velayati reiterated our country's desire to dispatch 5,000 
to 
10,000 troops to Bosnia and asked the UN Security Council to 
give the Bosnian Muslims the chance to defend themselves so as 
to prevent further genocide and ethnic cleansing. 
  According to a report of the Central News Unit, the Bosnian 
prime minister welcomed the clear and decisive stances of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran.

  [Text] Foreign ministers of the Islamic Conference 
Organization's contact group have asked for practical steps by 
the Islamic countries to solve the Bosnia crisis. At the 
conclusion of the group members' two-day session, held to follow 
up the UN measures to halt the Serbs' crimes, our country's 
Foreign Minister Mr. Velayati explained some points on the 
resolution of this session in a telephone conversation with a 
Central News Unit correspondent in Paris. We draw your 
attention to his remarks. 
  [Begin Velayati recording] There are positive and 
interesting 
points in the resolution of the contact group session. One of 
the points is that the Islamic countries will reconsider their 
economic ties with those countries which have undermined the 
course of liberating Bosnia and regaining the rights of the 
Muslims. It is an unprecedented move in practice that the 
Islamic countries are going to reconsider their economic ties 
with those countries which support the Serbs directly or 
indirectly. Such a decisions was never taken before by any 
international forum, including the Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO]. 
  Another point achieved in one of the resolution's articles 
says that should the United Nations fail to take decisive 
actions or if the decisions of the Security Council and the 
General Assembly are not put into practice, the Muslims, in 
accordance with the 88th resolution of the 48th session of the 
UN General Assembly, will feel free [mojaz] to take joint or 
individual action to help the Bosnian Muslims in various ways. 
Such links between the ICO and the United Nations were never 
established before. That is, we have not had such a legal 
basis, which is acceptable by the international community and at 
the same time gives a free hand to the Muslims to take direct 
action to help the Bosnians. [end recording]

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Jan (MENA)--A responsible source in the 
Foreign Ministry has stated that Egypt's position has 
consistently emphasized a comprehensive solution in the Middle 
East because there can be no fair and permanent solution that 
achieves security and stability in the region without a peace 
that enables all parties to regain their political and regional 
rights. The source was commenting on the Syrian-U.S. summit 
being held in Geneva between Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz 
al-Asad. 
  The source referred to the progress on certain tracks of the 
Arab-Israeli peace process, noting that there has been important 
progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track and progress on the 
Israeli-Jordanian track. He pointed out that the Syrian track 
has failed to make progress and has reached a stalemate, which 
threatens the peace efforts. A peace without Syria would be a 
"lame" peace, because an important party to the conflict would 
not have resolved its problems with Israel. 
  The source said that the peace-loving parties pin great 
hopes 
on the Syrian-U.S. summit reaching positive results and 
generating momentum in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. He said 
that the United States has always emphasized its interest in the 
success of its peaceful initiatives so that the Middle Eastern 
countries can devote their efforts to promoting their economies. 
He stressed that there is hope that both Syria and Israel will 
emerge from the vicious cycle and spell out their real 
intentions so that peace may be achieved in the region.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Jan (MENA)--The newspapers AL-AHRAM and 
AL- AKHBAR emphasize the importance of the Syrian-U.S. summit in 
Geneva, which seeks to give impetus to the Middle East peace 
process by surmounting the obstacles that have hindered progress 
in the Syrian- Israeli negotiations. 
  In an editorial in Sunday's issue, AL-AHRAM says that the 
Syrian-U.S. summit coincides with Washington's statement that it 
is holding contacts with all the Arab parties and Israel for 
resumption of the bilateral negotiations in the U.S. capital and 
to reach agreement on a specific date for this purpose. 
  The paper adds: The summit is even more significant because 
it will be followed three days later by the visit of Jordan's 
King Husayn's to Washington for a meeting with the U.S. 
President amid signs that a Jordanian-Israeli agreement is in 
the offing. 
  AL-AHRAM notes that promoting the Syrian-Israeli 
negotiations 
will also give impetus to the Lebanese-Israeli talks and 
encourage Palestinian and Israeli negotiators to seek the prompt 
implementation of autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. 
  AL-AKHBAR's editorial says the al-Asad-Clinton summit is an 
attempt to overcome the obstacles to the Syrian-Israeli talks on 
peace in the Middle East. It notes that Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin has retreated from his earlier position that his 
country is willing to withdraw from the Golan Heights. 
  The paper adds: It was understood right from the beginning 
of the Arab-Israeli negotiations in Madrid in 1991 that Israel 
agreed that these negotiations would be conducted in line with 
UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. 
  AL-AKHBAR says this is the solution that can guarantee a 
real 
and lasting peace between the Jewish state and the Arab 
countries in the region. 
  The paper urges Rabin and his colleagues to think again 
about 
the kind of peace that can be attained if Palestinian, Syrian, 
and Lebanese territories remain under Israeli control.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ahmad al-Qasir: "The Geneva Summit Is an </F>
Opportunity To Rescue the Peace Process From Collapse"] 
  [Text] Political observers around the world are currently 
turning their attention to Geneva, Switzerland, where the first 
summit will take place tomorrow between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad 
and Bill Clinton in a serious attempt to revitalize the peace 
process and realize progress on the Syrian track in line with 
achievements in the Palestinian and Jordanian tracks. This 
attempt will lead to a resumption of the Washington bilateral 
talks between the Arabs and Israel to finalize the Middle East 
peace process that was launched during the Madrid conference at 
the end of October 1992. 
  Peace-loving forces around the world are now asking the 
question of whether the American-Syrian summit will succeed in 
removing the obstacles before the peace process. In our attempt 
to answer this question, we begin by saying that this issue 
depends on to what extent the American role is active and 
serious in bolstering the peace efforts and convincing Israel to 
meet the Arabs half way, especially after the latter proved to 
the whole world the extent of their seriousness and honest 
desire to live peacefully with Israel. However, this should be 
based on international legitimacy and the Security Council 
resolutions that are based on the principle of land for peace, 
namely Resolutions 242 and 338. This is precisely what the U.S. 
President and Israeli rulers should realize: That there is a 
huge difference between a just peace and a peace imposed on 
others. 
  Syria has often declared its determination to proceed along 
the course of peace. It has also been backed by its Arab 
brothers in this regard, as became clear recently through the 
statement issued by the foreign ministers of the Damascus 
Declaration countries. It has also participated in all the 
previous rounds of the Washington negotiations. However, Syria 
wants an unconditional and just peace that guarantees security 
for all parties. This is what Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
will confirm tomorrow during his first meeting with the U.S. 
President. In addition, Washington must realize that peace in 
the Middle East is an indivisible whole and that it cannot be 
established except through parallel successes in all the Arab 
tracks. Also, for Syria and Israel to advance the peace 
process, there must be some trust between them, which is now 
absent. This absence of trust was also fueled by the stumbling 
negotiations between the PLO and Israel, despite the signing of 
the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, and by 
Israel's non- adherence to the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, which is considered the first step 
toward peace between the two sides. We believe Washington knows 
all these facts very well. 
  In light of all we have said so far, the ball is now in the 
court of Washington and Israel. If they want to conclude the 
peace process and put an end to the state of chronic tension in 
this sensitive part of the world, all they need to do is take 
serious steps to gain the confidence of Syria, which wants to 
regain its occupied territory in the Golan Heights without any 
preconditions. 
  The Geneva summit is considered an opportunity for the U.S. 
President to rescue the peace process sponsored by Washington 
from total collapse. If it is successful, not only will there 
be progress on the Syrian-Israeli track, but on all the other 
Arab tracks. In fact, the more important aspect is that if the 
Geneva summit is a success, it will be considered a 
foreign-policy success for President Clinton. This will also 
bolster the status and credibility of the United States in the 
international arena and within the new world order. 
  Egypt--represented by President Mubarak--has exerted 
magnanimous efforts to establish a just peace that provides 
security and the legitimate rights of the region's peoples. We 
say: Egypt, which is greatly concerned about peace, hopes the 
Geneva summit will succeed in realizing its aspired goals and 
will emerge with positive results that will lead to the 
resumption of the currently frozen Washington talks in the 
interest of all the peoples of the region, so that these people 
can dedicate themselves to comprehensive development and survive 
in an age of economic blocs.

<F P=106> [Muhammad al-Sa'id Fa'iq commentary: "Al-Asad-Clinton </F>
Meeting Is Positive Step Toward Peace"] 
  [Text] No Syrian-U.S. summit meeting ever captured media 
attention like today's meeting of Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and 
Bill Clinton in Geneva. 
  As far as timing goes, today's meeting takes on great 
importance, happening as it does when eyes full of hope and 
expectation are focused on the Mideast peace process and on ways 
to overcome obstacles to the process. 
  The meeting is also significant from the political and 
historical perspective because Syrian-U.S. relations have always 
been sensitive. The relationship has been unique and 
fluctuating but it has never been tense to the point of 
estrangement and never improved to the point of reconciliation 
and harmony. Hence, the importance of the summit meeting, 
especially as it takes place at a time when a comprehensive 
peace and nations' prosperity are a broad international desire, 
not just limited regional demands. 
  The U.S.-Syrian summit is truly a summit for Mideast peace. 
Its timing means the world is reiterating its commitment to 
establish a comprehensive and just peace in this strategic part 
of the world. It also means a renewal of international 
insistence on removing obstacles and solving problems that 
obstruct genuine progress toward peace. 
  Proceeding from this concept, the U.S. and Syrian sides 
agreed to hold the summit. The United States under President 
Bill Clinton today raises the slogan of a just peace as a course 
for a new world order in which Washington plays a primary, 
effective role in handling international politics. 
  When the situation requires advancing the Mideast peace 
effort and convincing Israel of the importance of a 
comprehensive and just peace based on UN resolutions and the 
principle of land for peace, that is, a complete withdrawal in 
exchange for a full peace, the U.S. role becomes important and 
necessary for our Arab nations to achieve the goals of regaining 
their land and rights without compromising their pan-Arab causes 
and just demands. 
  Look at the political and media uproar created a few days 
ago--in Israel or the United States--by circles opposed to 
improved Syrian- U.S. relations. By casting doubt about the 
Syrian stance on peace to spoil the summit's atmosphere and mar 
the political climate in which the Clinton-al-Asad talks are 
held, these circles showed that they recognize the importance of 
the Syrian role in the Mideast peace process. With its 
political weight and military might, Syria is one of the key 
influential states in the region playing a primary role in the 
peace process that cannot be ignored. 
  If Damascus has explained clearly its firm stance based on a 
comprehensive peace and on the need to achieve it based on the 
UN resolutions and the principle of land for peace and on the 
consideration that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles is a first step that should be followed by similar 
steps on other tracks to achieve a comprehensive peace, these 
hostile circles' doubts about the Syrian stance become 
meaningless and the accusations fail to achieve their aims. 
  The U.S.-Syrian summit is a positive step in favor of peace. 
The agreement to coordinate views and define the principles of 
a peaceful settlement between Syria and Israel, which basically 
relies on Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan in 
exchange for Syria normalizing its ties with Israel within the 
framework of a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, is indeed a positive push toward achieving a 
comprehensive and just peace. It is also a positive effort 
accredited to the U.S. President to save the peace process from 
the labyrinth of Israeli deception and their playing for time to 
avoid the obligations and responsibilities of peace.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Jan (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has 
stated that U.S. President Bill Clinton now knows and 
understands better Syria's position and its unquestionable right 
to regain its legitimate rights and the entire Golan Heights. 
When this materializes, the road to a fair and permanent peace 
will be open wide. In a commentary in Tuesday's edition, the 
paper says the meeting between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
and U.S. President Clinton clearly showed that the Syrian 
president conceals nothing and candidly declares his country's 
readiness to respond positively to everything Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin demands in return for ending the 
occupation of the Golan Heights. 
  AL-AKHBAR stated that every sign affirms that the 
Syrian-U.S. 
summit was successful by any standard and achieved in one day 
what 10 rounds of Syrian-Israeli talks failed to achieve. The 
paper notes President Clinton's complete understanding of the 
Syrian position and of President al-Asad's stance, despite 
Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's attempt to portray the talks as a 
lucrative deal for Syria [words indistinct].

returned to Cairo from Geneva this evening after heading the 
Egyptian delegation to the ministerial meeting of the Islamic 
Conference Organization's [ICO] liaison group bureau devoted to 
discussing the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In an arrival

summit resolutions to solve the Bosnian problem, and the Bosnian 
Government's stance on these proposals. [passage omitted] 
  Musa described the Syrian-U.S. summit held in Geneva 
yesterday as successful, adding that it is considered to be an 
important step, a landmark, on the Syrian-Israeli track and on 
the peaceful (?course) toward a comprehensive solution. He 
noted that the Syrian-U.S. summit may give a strong boost to the 
peace process that began in Madrid on the basis of land for 
peace. He noted that the peace process is now moving on the 
four Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian, and Jordanian tracks.

  These contacts aim at giving peace efforts an impetus to

power to the PLO in Gaza and Jericho as a step towards 
establishing Palestinian functions in other parts of the West 
Bank within five months, al-Baz said. 
  Egypt will pursue efforts and contacts with all parties 
concerned to overcome difficulties blocking application of the 
Palestinian- Israeli Declaration of Principles, he told MENA.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, arrived in Cairo 
from Tunis this evening after delivering a message from 
President Husni Mubarak to 'Arafat. In an arrival statement, he 
said that 'Arafat will arrive in Cairo during the weekend to 
discuss with President Mubarak the latest developments in the 
peace process. He will also meet with U.S. Secretary of Commerce 
Ronald Brown, who will visit Egypt to discuss the U.S. role in 
supporting Palestinian establishments in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Sha'th said that he briefed president 'Arafat and the PLO 
Executive Committee members on the progress in the Taba 
negotiations. He received instructions from the Palestinian 
leadership regarding the next round of talks that will begin 
tomorrow morning. He said that during tomorrow's round the two 
sides will complete discussions of transferring the civil powers 
and we hope that this week we will discuss the crossing points 
and the size of the Jericho area. He expressed his hope that 
the Israeli side will show more flexibility in view of the 
timetable for withdrawal. 
  Discussing the summit meeting between U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and its effect on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track, Dr. Sha'th said that this meeting was 
met with satisfaction because it represents U.S. recognition of 
the importance of a comprehensive solution. He stressed that 
the success of this summit will lead Syria to return to the 
peace process under the title of complete withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights and Syrian sovereignty over them. He noted that 
this is important to the peace process for two reasons: first, 
Syria's return to the peace process will lead to Lebanon's and 
Jordan's return as well, making the peace process comprehensive, 
and second this reasserts that the implementation of Security 
Council Resolution No. 242 means withdrawal from all the 
occupied territories.

  [Text] Deep differences have emerged between the Muslim 
Brotherhood and the Labor Party led by Ibrahim Shukri after the 
Labor Party agreed to start a national dialogue with other 
Egyptian parties. The dialogue will take place on the basis of 
legality and will reject dialogue with illegal parties, a 
condition placed by the National Democratic Party for any such 
dialogue. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood violently attacked its former ally 
the 
Labor Party, accusing it of ingratitude. It reminded the Labor 
Party that thanks to the Muslim Brotherhood, several Labor Party 
members were elected members of the People's Assembly and other 
local councils. 
  A message written by the Muslim Brotherhood's Guidance 
Office 
and addressed to Labor Party deputy leader 'Adil Husayn says the 
slogan "Islam is the solution" is a Muslim Brotherhood slogan 
and that it is under this slogan that the Labor Party has made 
headway here and there.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 15 Jan (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has announced that 159 cases of bribery and squandering 
of public wealth were uncovered in 1993, in addition to 760 
cases of embezzlement, 2,226 cases of forgery, and 241 cases of 
currency fraud and smuggling. He said that 3,931 sentences 
were passed and implemented. 
  This came in a statement the interior minister made to a 
meeting of the Consultative Council's Arab, Foreign Affairs, and 
National Security Committee this evening. Consultative Council 
Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi chaired the meeting. [passage 
omitted] 
  Al-Alfi said that a firm stand against terrorism comprises a 
basic part of the Interior Ministry's security plan without 
ignoring its overall security duties. He said the ministry's 
security plan stresses a decisive confrontation with terrorism 
to safeguard stability and the citizens' security while at the 
same time raising the standard of services to the public and 
remedying negative conditions in the country's prisons. 
[passage omitted] 
  The interior minister said that the current confrontation is 
based on the security forces always taking the initiative in 
striking effective and repeated blows against dangerous groups 
while ensuring that all legal standards are observed. He 
explained that there is no alternative to a firm and 
comprehensive confrontation with terrorists because any other 
course would mean compromising the homeland's future and destiny. 
  He pointed out that the initiative shown by the security 
forces has put a decisive end to the exploitation of the mosques 
in Asyut for the propagation of extremist ideas and helped to 
uncover the plan to assassinate the prime minister and to 
apprehend the terrorist group in Shubra al-Khaymah that had been 
instructed to carry out a series of assassinations and other 
terrorist acts. [passage omitted] 
  The interior minister revealed the existence of bilateral 
agreements to extradite terrorists, noting that several of them 
have been extradited from abroad and several others will be 
extradited shortly. He said this is being done with the help of 
other government departments. 
  Concerning the disappearance of former Libyan foreign 
minister Mansur al-Kikhya, the interior minister said: We have 
not uncovered the facts of the case yet. We cannot say anything

  He said he is totally opposed to indiscriminate arrests and 
that only the actual culprit must be punished. Adding that he 
will not hesitate to question and punish anyone who makes a 
mistake, he said daily inspections must be made in all 
governorates and central police stations to maintain proper 
performance standards and ensure that members of the public 
brought to police stations are well treated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Egyptian security service has divided 
antigovernment activities into the following categories: 
  1. Al-Shawqiyun specialize in robbing Christian-owned 
jewelry shops to finance their movement; 
  2. The operations of al-Jihad group and al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah are confined to military activities against tourism 
and tourists; and 
  3. The Vanguards of Conquest specialize in carrying out 
assassinations and explosions against officials and security men.

  [Text] Cairo, Jan 16 (AFP)--The Egyptian interior ministry 
has paid a Muslim militant 20,000 pounds (6,000 dollars) for 
leaving a radical group involved in anti-government activities, 
the police said Sunday. 
  'Adil Muhammad 'Abd-al-Baqi, a key member of Al-Shawqiyun 
which is based primarily in al-Fayyum southeast of Cairo, had 
decided to leave the organisation and declared he had repented 
by condemning its terrorist activities, they said. 
  But the police provided no details on the conditions 
surrounding his surrender or any possible charges that may be 
brought against him. 
  Last month the ministry gave out rewards of 100,000 Egyptian 
pounds (30,000 dollars) to three people who provided police with 
information on a fundamentalist involved in a car bomb attack 
that almost killed Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi on 
November 25. 
  The ministry recently announced it would pay 100,000 pounds 
to any person providing information leading to the arrest of a 
wanted fundamentalist. 
  Muslim militants in Egypt have since March 1992 launched a 
bloody campaign to topple the secular government of President 
Husni Mubarak by targeting senior officials, policemen, tourists 
and Coptic Christians.

  [Text] Opposition party leaders have given unanimous and 
warm support for President Mubarak's call for national dialogue. 
The opposition party leaders confirmed the country's dire need 
for such a dialogue in order to discuss the various aspects of 
political reform and the way to confront terrorism. 
  Kamal al-Shadhili, National Democratic Party [NDP] assistant 
secretary general, said that during the first session of the 
newly formed NDP Secretariat, President Mubarak defined the 
NDP's policy vis-a-vis the opposition parties. President 
Mubarak said that the NDP is committed to national dialogue and 
its goals and to creating the right atmosphere for holding it. 
Dialogue, Mubarak said, has to take place in a political 
framework conducive to promoting the country's supreme interests. 
  Al-Shadhili added that dialogue represents one part of the 
NDP's wide-ranging political bid to mobilize the country's 
forces and consolidate the home front in the face of the 
challenges facing Egypt, particularly that of terror. 
  Meanwhile, the secretary general of the National Progressive 
Unionist Grouping Party described the call for national dialogue 
as a civilized and positive step worthy of cooperation and every 
effort to make it succeed.

Zakariya 'Azmi, head of the presidential office and a People's 
Assembly member, has submitted a complaint to Attorney General 
Raja' al-'Arabi against the newspaper AL-SHA'B regarding a 
report that it published in today's issue. 
  The complaint stated that the newspaper's report is totally 
unfounded and that the claims made in it are a figment of the 
writer's imagination. Dr. 'Azmi stressed that the newspaper's 
report constitutes slander against him and his reputation and 
therefore is an act punishable by law. 
  AL-SHA'B reported that Dr.'Azmi is a partner of Madinat 
al-Nasr multimillionaire Fawzi al-Sayyid, who is under arrest 
for committing violations in the construction of high-rise 
buildings.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Jan (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has stated that the Interior Ministry's investigation 
departments continue their battle against deviation and 
corruption and apprehend the perpetrators immediately. 
  In a statement following the inauguration of the renovated 
general traffic department building in Madinat al-Nasr today, 
al-Alfi asserted that the state is exposing any deviation, 
corruption, or breach of the law, that confronting corruption is 
the state's policy, and that no one is above the law. 
  On reports that some security officials are involved in the 
case of the Madinat al-Nasr multimillionaire, who was arrested 
recently, al-Alfi said that no conclusive evidence has been 
brought against any security official and that the current 
reports are mere rumors. 
  Al-Alfi added that the prosecutor is conducting his 
investigations. Therefore, no premature judgment can be made. 
However, if there were violations or someone was involved, this 
will show up in the investigations. No one is above the law. 
  On the security forces' efforts to hunt down terrorists, 
especially in Upper Egypt, and their shift to a defensive 
position, al-Alfi denied this, stressing that the security 
authorities have always been in control of the situation and 
that they continue to take the initiative in tracking down the 
terrorist elements. 
  He explained that the security authorities continue their 
work day and night to confront any deviations or incidents 
committed against the state's security and stability. 
  On Pakistan's expulsion of terrorist elements from its 
territory and whether any of these terrorists have been 
arrested, al-Alfi explained that there are continued contacts 
with a number of states in this regard.

  [Text] The political and economic situation in Algeria, the 
forthcoming national conference, Algerian-European cooperation, 
and the AMU [Arab Maghreb Union]-EU dialogue have all been the 
subject of an interview our Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah 
Dembri gave to the Portuguese newspaper DIARIO DOMINICAL. 
  Mohamed Salah Dembri reaffirmed on this occasion that 
Algeria 
is currently following two courses: political reforms and 
economic reforms. 
  About the awaited national conference, Dembri said he 
expects 
the participants in this conference to define the measures of 
the transitional period on the basis of the prepared action 
program. 
  Dembri added that presidential and legislative elections 
will 
be organized following the interim period, which will last three 
years or possibly less. 
  Concerning the participants in the national conference, 
Dembri said this conference will be open to all those who do not 
use violence for political aims and to all those who respect the 
elements that constitute national identity. 
  In the second part of the interview, Dembri discussed the 
economic situation. He touched on negotiations with the IMF, 
noting that Algeria's move to a market economy should not be 
accompanied by great social upheaval.

<F P=106> [Central News Unit report from Paris] </F>
  [Text] The Islamic groups in Algeria have set up a 
clandestine television transmitter that broadcasts programs on 
an Algerian television channel. 
  According to a Central News Unit report from Paris citing 
the 
newspaper LIBERATION, in circumstances when the Algerian 
Government has deprived Islamists of all resources and is trying 
to suppress them, the appearance of an Islamic television 
network in the country, even for a short time, has perturbed 
Algerian officials. 
  Numerous residents in the Algiers area saw the television 
network's program at 1815 to 1830 last Monday [3 Jan] on channel 
21 on the UHF band. 
  This program presented the latest reports on the condition 
of 
Algerian combatants followed by a request to all armed Islamic 
groups to forge solidarity against the dictatorship in Algeria 
and still pictures of incarcerated FIS leaders. 
  According to LIBERATION, the Algerian Islamists are also 
presenting regular weekly programs, referred to as Wafa 
[loyalty] radio, by means of radio apparatus. In this program, 
they transmit radio messages on frequencies used by the police 
and security forces, repeatedly calling on these forces to 
refrain from fighting against and killing their own brothers and 
asking them to abandon the dictatorial regime.

  [Text] Tripoli, A'ina Al-Nar [January] 16, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY -- A source at the Secretariat of the General People's 
Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation 
welcomed the stance of China towards changing the U.N Security 
Council [UNSC] as declared by the spokesman of the Chinese 
Foreign Ministry asserting China's refusal of any change in the 
Security Council before submitting the matter to all U.N member 
states for debate and that the restructuring of the Security 
Council to include Germany and Japan would not fulfil the desire 
of some countries. 
  In a statement to JANA, the source said "while we welcome 
the 
Chinese stance and support it, we would like to stress that this 
stance coincides with continuous call of the Great Jamahiriyah 
for the [word indistinct] reconstruct the U.N granting all 
peoples a role on the basis of justice and equality in 
accordance with its charter to which those peoples responded to 
the invitation to join this international organisation 
especially as the smaller nations began to fear for their future 
before the current state of the U.N which became the voice of 
only the major countries hence the international organisation is 
being harnessed to serve the interests and objectives of most 
powerful countries. [no closing quotation marks as received] 
  The source pointed out that the Great Jamahiriyah, being at 
the forefront of the peoples harmed by the current situation and 
control of the Security Council by the major powers, sees in the 
stance of China a major support for the position of the smaller 
nations who are fearing for their future in the light of the 
change of international organisation into an instrument of 
threats against peoples and plots against their future and 
spreading war amongst them instead of being a secure refuge for 
peoples seeking to safeguard their future, an instrument for the 
protection of their rights and maintenance of a genuine peace in 
the world. 
  The leader of the revolution pointed out, on many occasions, 
that the time has come for the restructuring of the U.N and 
changing the Security Council as an organ of all nations and 
that this change is the right of all member states and peoples 
to whom it should be referred and discussed and express an 
opinion about it and that the move towards opening the door of 
granting permanent membership and veto in the Security Council 
only to the industrial major powers is an orientation to crush 
the smaller nations who suffered a great deal from the monopoly 
of veto by the major powers for which these nations continue to 
pay the price. 
  Thus the revision of the veto power is required so that the 
decision making power should lie in the hands of the General 
Assembly or the in the hands of all member peoples of this 
organisation.

AGENCY -- Switzerland declared that she will start the 
implementation of the tightening of the coercive measures 
imposed by the Western countries through the so-called Security 
Council. This came in a statement by the Swiss Foreign Ministry. 
  Switzerland claims that she is a neutral country and many 
Libyans go there for medical treatment at her hospitals 
supporting her economy through spending. Accordingly the Libyans 
should take note of this as they declare daily their defiance of 
the embargo and readiness for confrontation.

  [Text] Khartoum, 17 Jan (SUNA) -- Engineer Gwang Tonj, 
governor of Upper Nile State, has said that the state is 
experiencing widespread security thanks to cooperation between 
many quarters and to the negotiations between the rebel united 
movement, the Nasir wing, and the government. The Nasir wing 
[Riak Machar's rebel faction] had agreed to negotiate with the 
government without any intermediary and rejected the outcome of 
the Washington symposium. 
  In a press conference he held here today, he said that the 
government was determined to bring about security and stability. 
He said that displaced persons had been removed to towns 
prepared for them where all the necessary services were 
provided. He said that there was stability in the school system 
at all levels and the University of the Upper Nile would begin 
work at the beginning of April. He added that the state had 
drawn up plans for the eradication of illiteracy. 
  His Excellency also said that the citizens of Upper Nile had 
welcomed the decision on the redivision of states which aimed to 
bring the authorities nearer to the citizens and would also 
provide the opportunity for everyone to take part in governing. 
He went on to say that the state was determined to achieve 
peace and development to build the nation. He confirmed that 
the citizens of the state support the revolution's proposals on 
participation in power for the building of Sudan.

  [Text] A responsible source at the General Command of the 
People's Armed Forces has stated that the Cairo-based elements 
of the opposition alliance have begun contacts with the rebel 
Riak Machar, with the objective of planning what they call the 
bringing down of the Khartoum government. 
  The source confirmed that Riak Machar had received a number 
of letters from Mubarak al-Fadil and Umar Nur al-Da'im through 
their contact, Hashim Muhammad Ali Ziyadah, expressing their 
regret that they did not consult one another in Washington to 
enable them to overthrow the government. They expressed their 
full support for him, as the lies of John Garang had become 
clear to them, as had the fact that the coup against Garang at 
Nasir was not Khartoum- inspired. They said that their support 
for him would be through the humanitarian organization which he 
founded under the name of Medical in Need [preceding three words 
in English]. They invited him and his group to attend the 
national constitutional congress which the opposition is 
planning to hold in Cairo, by sending his observers.

"Kabul Shelled by Rockets, Exposed to Ground Attack"] 
  [Excerpts] Jeddah, Peshawar -- The Afghan capital and its 
northern suburbs yesterday witnessed battles which observers 
said "it never experienced during the jihad against the 
communists or in Afghanistan's contemporary history." The 
alliance opposed to President Borhanoddin Rabbani used Scud and 
Organ [as received] missiles to shell government positions. 
[passage omitted] 
  Afghan diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia have told AL-HAYAH 
that Rabbani's condition for agreeing to a truce is for 
Hekmatyar to completely sever his links with the militias and 
the communists and hand over all the heavy weapons in his 
possession to the Defense Ministry. He also demanded strong 
guarantees from high-level circles that the Hezb-e Eslami 
[Islamic Party of Afghanistan] will not try to violate the 
cease-fire again or participate in any "future conspiracy to 
seize power" in the country. 
  The sources also emphasized that the Afghan presidency is 
not 
prepared at all to hold talks with Dostam and his allies. They 
quoted Rabbani's sources as saying that Rabbani is willing to 
hold general elections under international supervision, as 
stated in the Mecca declaration, provided that the elections be 
held six months after the end of the head of state's term.

  [Text] Peshawar -- A group of 46 Afghan commanders have 
initiated a campaign to bring an end to the 16-day battle for 
Kabul. 
  The group, which includes well-known commanders like Manlvi 
Siddiqullah, Sher Alam, Anwar Khan and Karim Qarabagh, met 
leaders of the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan]-led 
Supreme Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution of 
Afghanistan at Charasyab Sunday [16 Jan] to discuss peace 
proposals. The group, which includes several pro-Rabbani 
commanders, was reportedly also in touch with Rabbani and his 
former defence minister, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. 
  The moves came amidst reports of bombing of Kabul by General 
Dostam's jet-fighters. Qarcebar Rahman Saeed, a Supreme Council 
spokesman, said Rabbani positions at Dashit-e Chamiala and in 
the capital were bombed. Radio Kabul, monitored in Peshawar, 
however, reported that Dostam's aircraft bombed civilian areas 
with cluster bombs. Both sides reported that there were almost 
no ground battles on Sunday. 
  According to Saeed, the delegation brought a letter from 
Mas'ud expressing his readiness to accept the verdict of a 
15-member commission comprising three representatives each of 
Rabbani's Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], Hezb-e Eslami 
(Hekmatyar), Hezb-e Eslami (Khalis), Sayyaf's Ettehad-e Eslami-e 
[Islamic Union of Afghanistan] and Manlvi Mohammadi's Harekat-e 
Enqelab-e Eslami [Islamic Revolution Movement]. 
  Saeed said the Council made it clear to the commanders that 
they would not agree to a ceasefire, but were ready to discuss 
Rabbani's resignation. He said a four-member delegation, 
including one nominee each from Hezb-e Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat 
[Islamic Unity Party], Mojadeddi's ANLF [National Liberation 
Front of Afghanistan] and Dostam's Junbush-e Melli Eslami, was 
being formed. Jami'at-e Eslami sources in Peshawar said they 
were unaware of Mas'ud's letter or proposal. 
  Saeed added that the Supreme Council welcomed Pakistan's 
proposal for a regional conference, though it insisted on 
Rabbani's resignation as a pre-condition. 
  Radio Kabul quoted Dr Najibollah Lafra'i as saying that 
Rabbani would not accept a temporary ceasefire and would not 
talk to Dostam's militia. He said peace talks with Hezb-e 
Eslami were possible provided it gave up its heavy arms, 
guaranteed not to fight against the government and broke its 
ties with Dostam. 
  Amir Usman, Pakistan's ambassador in Afghanistan, Sunday 
travelled to Jalalabad to meet the Nangarhar Shura. A Shura 
spokesman informed The News that the delegation told the 
ambassador about the difficulties faced by Afghans following 
Pakistan's decision to seal its border with Afghanistan. 
  Meanwhile, another 32 UN trucks carrying relief supplies 
left 
Peshawar for Jalalabad Sunday. The trucks carried tents, flour 
and UNICEF-donated medicines for the two new camps near 
Jalalabad. 
  More than 100 Pakistani lawyers in Peshawar have signed a 
memorandum calling on the United Nations to provide a safe 
passage to former Afghan president, Dr Najibollah, from 
war-battered Kabul. It pointed out that Dr Najibollah had 
stepped down as part of a UN-brokered peace plan, but was still 
being held at UN premises in Kabul. The memorandum said Dr 
Najibollah should be freed, not only to fulfill a UN obligation 
but also because of security problems.

  [Text] The press department of the presidency told the 
Bakhtar Information Agency that the country's president, 
esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, received a 
decision-making council [da tasmim newalo shura] of Kabul's 
mosques, Takia Khanas [Shiite prayer places], ulemas, and elders 
this afternoon. 
  Opening the meeting, a few verses were read out by one of 
the 
ulema and then esteemed Mawlawi Ataurrahman introduced members 
of the decision-making council to the esteemed president of the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan. 
  Then, Hojjat ol-Eslam Walmoslemin Khodadad Erfani spoke 
about 
the coup attempt by a group of criminals and said: 
  Criminal communists once again, in collaboration with the 
hypocrite Golboddin, soiled their hands with the blood of the 
innocent and Muslim people of Afghanistan. Hekmatyar is a 
hypocrite element of our era who destroyed Kabul due to the 
existence of militia in the past. Distinction between the 
militia and Golboddin is now difficult to make. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Erfani also said that the Sunni and Shi'ia 
ulema of Afghanistan have expressed support for the declared 
jihad by the president of Afghanistan. He considered jihad 
against militia and communists as the duty of every Muslim. 
  Then esteemed Mawlawi Ruhani and Mawlawi Kefayatollah spoke 
in turn and considered jihad against the militia as a duty to 
God. 
  The esteemed president then praised the role of ulema during 
the era of jihad and said: It is without any doubt that, under 
the present conditions, the faithful ulema have taken their 
resolute stand. This means that the conscience of our nation is 
awake and your meeting is indicative of the national and 
religious unity of our country.

<F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kabul, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The first relief convoy 
of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in nearly 
three weeks arrived in Kabul on Monday, delivering 20 tonnes of 
medical supplies to the besieged city. 
  The supplies come at a crucial time as Kabul's hospitals and 
clinics reported at the weekend that nearly 6,000 people had 
been treated for wounds sustained in fighting between troops 
loyal to Afghan Government troops and mojahedin under 
ex-communist general Abdol Rashid Dostam. 
  The convoy, consisting of seven vehicles, made it to the 
Afghan capital under a light dusting of snow and the sporadic 
exchange of small arms fire and artillery bombardments around 
the city. [passage omitted] 
  The Red Cross vehicles were able to make the dangerous 
overland journey from the Pakistan border to the capital because 
of good relations with the warring factions, said Kabul's Red 
Cross chief Peter Stocker. 
  "Through our humanitarian work, carried out both inside and 
outside Kabul, we have reliable contacts enabling us to obtain 
security guarantees," Stocker said. 
  The Red Cross convoy brought with it badly needed 
antibiotics, dressings and general medicines. 
  Volunteer workers of the Afghan Red Crescent Society 
unloaded 
the medical supplies in Kabul, which will be distributed to the 
23 hospitals and clinics in and around the capital which are 
supported by the ICRC. 
  With the arrival of winter, the arrival of the convoy, which 
included four land cruisers, was welcomed as a valuable asset to 
the ICRC here, enabling the organization to expand its 
operations to cope with the fighting now in its 17th day. 
  The Red Cross also evacuated seven foreigners from Kabul by 
road Monday, including six Indonesians, among them three 
children aged 12 and under, and a German businessman who was 
said to represent a satellite-telephone company. 
  Meanwhile, in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, 
the powerful Hezb-e Eslami faction, which has been fighting the 
government alongside Dostam's forces, accused Saudi Arabian 
intelligence Monday of maligning its leader Golboddin Hekmatyar. 
  Hekmatyar, who is also prime minister, has long been at odds 
with President Borhanoddin Rabbani and his ally and former 
defense minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. 
  Hezb leader Nawab Salim in a statement advised Saudi 
Arabia's 
King Fahd to "bridle" his intelligence and "enslaved media" and 
stop "interferring" in Afghanistan's internal affairs. 
  The statement said the Saudi regime was propagating "fake 
fatwas," or religious rulings, against the Coordination Council 
of Islamic Revolution (CCIR), which includes Hezb, Dostam's 
Junbish movement and other mojahedin groups.

permanent peace. Dr. Najibollah Lefrai, state minister in 
foreign affairs, told a Bakhtar Information Agency that an 
Afghan special envoy, who has recently gone to Pakistan, has 
delivered a message from the Afghan president to Pakistan's 
president at a meeting. They talked about a permanent peace and 
explained our principled stand. 
  Dr. Lefrai said the position taken by Afghanistan has not 
changed. The conspirators should surrender their heavy weapons. 
The Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] lead by 
Golboddin Hekmatyar should give guarantees of no more war 
against the state.

<F P=106> [News conference by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. </F>
President Bill Clinton in Geneva with unidentified reporters; 
Clinton speaks in English -- live] 
  [Text] [al-Asad] At the conclusion of the important and 
constructive talks today between President Clinton and me, I 
would like to express my deep satisfaction with what these talks 
reflected in terms of the United States' determination to do its 
best in order to get the peace process to its aspired 
target--the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in 
the region by implementing Security Council Resolutions No. 242, 
338, and 425 and the land-for-peace principle. In this regard, 
I believe that despite the great importance that President 
Clinton attaches to domestic affairs in his country, he has 
given special attention as a full partner and honest broker in 
order to help the parties achieve a comprehensive peace that 
concerns not only the people of the region, but all world 
nations. 
  Today's meeting between me and President Clinton crowned a 
series of correspondences and telephone calls between us during 
the last year. I hope that our meeting today will contribute to 
achieving the aspirations of the region's peoples that this new 
year be a year for the establishment of a just and comprehensive 
peace that puts an end to the tragedies of violence and wars 
from which these peoples have been suffering for several decades. 
  During our meeting, I had the opportunity to emphasize to 
President Clinton Syria's firm commitment to the bases and 
principles of the peace process and our strong faith that peace 
cannot be real and lasting unless it its comprehensive and based 
on the principles of international legitimacy and justice. This 
means serious work for a just solution on all tracks. Current 
and historical evidence proves that separate peace deals and 
partial solutions cannot secure a real peace in the region. In 
this regard, I would like to express my satisfaction that 
President Clinton is personally committed to the objective of a 
comprehensive peace. Accordingly, we agreed to work together in 
order to render successful the efforts aimed at putting an end 
to the Arab-Israeli conflict and reach a comprehensive and real 
peace that enables the region's peoples to concentrate on their 
development, progress, and prosperity. 
  This meeting also gave us the opportunity to exchange views 
on a number of issues, including those related to bilateral 
relations, and we agreed that the noble objective we are working 
for together requires a qualitative step toward better 
relations. We also discussed issues related to the regional 
situation and all that would contribute to security and 
stability in the Middle East. 
  Syria seeks a just and comprehensive peace with Israel as a 
strategic option that guarantees Arab rights, terminates the 
Israeli occupation, and enables all the region's peoples to live 
in peace, safety, and dignity. We fought honorably, negotiate 
honorably, and make peace honorably. We want an honorable peace 
for our people and for hundreds of thousands of those who 
sacrificed their lives in defense of the homeland and its 
rights. There is almost no house in Syria that has not lost a 
martyr in defense of the homeland, nation, and Arab rights. For 
the sake of all those and for the sake of their sons and 
families, we want the peace of the brave, a real peace that 
thrives, continues, guarantees the interests of all, and gives 
rights to their owners. If the leaders of Israel have enough 
courage to respond to such a peace, a new era of security and 
stability and normal peaceful relations among all will emerge in 
the region. Thank you. [applause] 
  [Clinton] In pursuit of that priority I have always viewed 
Syria's involvement as critical. That is why from the outset of 
our administration, I have engaged President al-Asad in a 
regular correspondence by telephone and letter, and why I am now 
pleased to have had this opportunity to hear personally 
President al-Asad's views about how best to make this a year of 
[words indistinct] to produce real peace. The accord between 
Israel and the PLO marks a first step to lay the groundwork for 
a solution to the Palestinian problem. I have said that I 
believe Syria to be the key and that its role is critical for 
achieving a true and lasting peace between Israel and its 
neighbors. As you have heard, President al-Asad shares with me 
the goal of achieving a comprehensive peace with Israel and 
peaceful relations between the neighbors. Israel and Syria will 
have to make crucial decisions to achieve peace. Hence, 
al-Asad's call for a peace of the brave. You have heard him say 
that now, and I support this. Today we worked together to bring 
the peace talks that began in Madrid two years ago to a 
successful conclusion. There are important problems that need 
to be solved. There are problems related to withdrawal, peace, 
and security. We will try to solve the issues that are 
connected with peace, withdrawal, and security. But I am 
confident that we have laid the foundations for real progress. 
The heads of delegations will begin again talks in Washington 
next week. We also discussed the state of relations between the 
United States and Syria and agreed on the desirability of 
improving them. This requires honestly addressing the problems 
in our relationship. Accordingly, we have instructed the 
secretary of state and the Syrian foreign minister to establish 
a mechanism to address these issues in detail and openly. For 
too long, the Middle East has been denied the benefits of peace, 
and yet it is within our power to create the conditions that 
will enable Israeli and Arab -- Muslim, Christian, and Jew -- to 
live together in peace. Today's meeting was an important step 
for fulfilling that vision. We have a lot of work to do, but we 
are closer to our goal. Thank you. [applause] 
  [Reporter, in English] Mr. President: Do you feel that you 
have a firm commitment from President al-Asad to normalize 
relations with Israel, and by that I mean open borders, free 
trade, and diplomatic relations? 
  [Clinton] The short answer is yes. I believe that President 
al-Asad has made a clear, forthright and very important 
statement on normal, peaceful relations now. In order to 
achieve those relations, a peace agreement has to be negotiated 
in good faith and carried out. But this is an important 
statement, the first time that there has been a clear expression 
that there will be a possibility of that sort of relationship. 
  [Reporter, in Arabic] Mr. President: All the separate 
agreements have proved a failure, the most notable examples 
being the 17 May agreement in Lebanon and the Gaza-Jericho 
accord. UN resolutions on Iraq have been applied firmly. To 
date, Resolution 425 on Lebanon remains unenforced. When will 
we see a commitment to UN Resolutions, including 425? 
  [Clinton] First of all, as to the specifics of the 
implementation, that will be part of the process of negotiation. 
But let me answer the first, and more important question, I 
think. I think all the parties in this process recognize that it 
cannot succeed unless all the tracks are brought to a successful 
conclusion. That is, I think President al-Asad was very 
eloquent in our meeting today about the question of Lebanon, and 
Jordan, for that matter, in saying that even Syria may feel 
fully satisfied with its differences with Israel if they could 
be worked out, there would still have to be a comprehensive 
peace in which the issues affecting Lebanon, the issues 
affecting Jordan, and the issues relating to the PLO would, in 
addition to the Syrian issues, would all be resolved. We are all 
committed to that. 
  [Reporter, in English] Mr. al-Asad. President Clinton is 
the fifth, the fourth American President you're meeting now. Do 
you think you can afford to wait for a fifth one or have you 
decided to sign the peace now? 
  [Al-Asad] Yes. We are ready to sign peace now. 
  [Reporter, in English] President Clinton. Beyond the broad 
assurances that you and President al-Asad have spoken of here 
about the willingness to seek peace and to negotiate it. Do you 
have, Sir, as a result of these meetings, any of the kinds of 
specific detailed concessions or a sense of willingness to make 
concessions that might make a successful negotiation possible? 
And if so, can you tell us in what areas they are? 
  [Clinton] Well, as you know, I have a very strong conviction 
that the specifics of this agreement will have to be negotiated 
by the parties themselves. And even though I have in mind 
several things, I think that it is very important that those of 
us who are trying to facilitate these discussions not discuss 
the details of them. The parties are going to have to work that 
out. 
  Let me say that an indication has been given here by the 
very 
important statement that President al-Asad has already made, 
stating clearly that it is time to end the conflict with Israel, 
make peace with Israel, that peace can be, should lead to normal 
and peaceful relations. I would hope that this would provoke a 
positive response in Israel and that the parties would get 
together and work these details out. That is not for the United 
States to dictate. 
  [Reporter, in Arabic] President Clinton. Despite the peace 
talks since the Madrid conference, Israel continues to build 
settlements in the occupied Arab territories which, according to 
all international standards, are considered illegitimate and a 
violation of UN resolutions. Moreover, at a time when Syria 
signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has demanded 
over the years that the Middle East be a region free of weapons 
of mass destruction--nuclear, chemical, and biological 
weapons--Israel still refuses to sign the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty and continues to stockpile weapons. 
Mr. President, do you not think that these Israeli stands and 
practices contradict the concept of peace for which you are 
working? Thank you. 
  [Clinton] First, sir, I believe the question of settlements 
in disputed areas is one of the things that clearly will have to 
be resolved in connection with this peace process consistent 
with United Nations resolutions and the concept of territory for 
peace. I said that in my opening statement. I expect that to 
work, to be worked through. 
  Secondly, on the question of weapons, I believe the best 
chance we have to stop the spread of weapons of mass 
destruction, that includes not only nuclear but also biological 
and chemical weapons, and indeed to slow the sophisticated 
conventional arms race in the Middle East is to finish this 
peace process successfully. I think that is, as a practical 
matter, the only way to do it. And we're going to, the United 
States will work as hard as we can toward that objective. 
  [Reporter, in English] President al-Asad: Are you clearly 
stating unequivocally today that in exchange for a full Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, Syria would be prepared to 
establish normal diplomatic relations with Israel, including 
open borders, including tourism, the same kind of peace treaty 
that Israel established with Egypt? 
  [Al-Asad] All of us, foremost the United States and 
President Clinton, are trying to make peace comprehensive in 
order to make it lasting and just. Within this framework, we 
are trying to achieve a real peace that will secure rights for 
everyone and secure a stable life for everyone. In such a 
solution, all the region's peoples, as well as all the world's 
nations, have an interest. President Clinton and I were in 
agreement regarding our views. We will respond to peace 
requirements. This matter, as you know, is a subject to be 
tackled at the negotiating table, not during this conference. 
  [Reporter, in Arabic] This question is posed to President 
Clinton: The United States has proposed itself as a full 
partner and an honest broker. Syria welcomed this and 
cooperated with this for the sake of a peace process that is of 
concern to the entire world. Despite this, the United States 
still deals with Syria in a way which is different from the way 
it deals with Israel, particularly in the field of financial and 
military aid. What is your explanation of this? Thank you. 
  [Clinton] [words indistinct] ... with Syria over a number of 
issues, including our differences over questions relating to 
certain groups, PKK [Kurdish Workers Party], Hizballah, the 
Jibril group [Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command], others, other issues. We talked 
about these differences for about an hour today without any view 
toward trying to resolve them. We agreed on two things, and I 
think this is very important. One is that if we can maintain 
one another's confidence working toward a peaceful solution in 
the Middle East, that that would do a great deal for our 
bilateral relations and for a better future. And the second is 
that we needed to have a process that had integrity, established 
by the secretary of state and the Syrian foreign minister. That 
would go beyond public exchanges to a very specific delineation 
of the differences between us and an honest effort to resolve 
them or to make progress on them. So, sir, I think the best 
answer to your question is that we think that the progress 
perhaps can be made. We've set up a mechanism to deal honestly 
with the differences between us, and we believe maintaining each 
other's confidence by a good-faith effort in the Middle East 
peace process is the most important thing we can do at this 
moment in our history. 
  [Reporter, in English] Mr. President: If the subject is so 
close to your heart, but you evaded answering whether you 
thought that Israel could sign a Non-Proliferation Treaty, my 
real question is: Did you discuss and set a timetable for 
Israeli and Syrian troops to come out of Lebanon? 
  [Clinton] We did not have any discussions today about the 
details of any face of the Middle East peace process because the 
other parties are not here present, and it would not have been 
an appropriate thing to do. 
  [Reporter, in Arabic] [words indistinct] 
  [Clinton, interrupting] Excuse me, I got one of those 
helpful little hands from one of my staff members down here. I 
apologize to interrupt you. I want to be perfectly forthright 
because I don't want to leave a false impression that might be 
adversely interpreted against President al-Asad. We did discuss 
the importance of having the Lebanese peace process go on 
parallel to the Israeli-Syrian process. I reaffirm my support 
for the al-Ta'if accord, and President al-Asad agrees that there 
should be a successful conclusion of a peace process which left 
Lebanon free and independent as a nation. So, there was no 
difference between us on the objective. And I didn't want 
anything I said to be read unfairly against him on that score. 
We actually, I think, reached complete meeting of the mind. 
  [Reporter, in English] In my interview with you, on 13 
September at the White House, you called for a bigger Syrian 
role in the peace process, and you called personally on His 
Excellency President al-Asad to play a personal role in forging 
ahead a breakthrough in the peace process. Now that you've met 
President al-Asad face to face for the first time, what is your 
impression about President al-Asad? And how do you view his 
personal role in achieving that breakthrough? 
  [Clinton] Well, first of all, you know I had heard a lot 
about President al-Asad's legendary stamina in these meetings. 
[laughter] And when we called a break four hours and 20 minutes 
into our meeting, I can tell you that his reputation does not 
exceed the reality. He deserves every bit of it. Secondly, we 
had the opportunity, because we did talk for so long, we had the 
opportunity to exchange not only our views about the issues in 
play at present but also I had the opportunity to learn 
President al-Asad's perspective over a period exceeding 20 years 
now on some of these issues. And it reinforced my belief, as 
expressed in September, that there would be no comprehensive 
peace in the Middle East unless he were willing to take a 
leadership role, and that he has decided to take the risks that 
all these leaders, if they really want peace, are going to have 
to take. And so, I guess, I would have to say that that is the 
most important thing to me. The thing that was most impressive, 
I believe, that he is committed to trying to work through this 
as quickly as possible, and I think others will see that 
commitment and will respond in an appropriate way. 
  [Reporter, in Arabic] President Clinton, if peace is an 
international need, and the U.S. Administration is seriously 
seeking to achieve it, providing that it is also a U.S., 
Israeli, and Syrian need, then why does the peace process 
stumble every now and then? How will the U.S. Administration, 
taking into consideration that it is the most important 
cosponsor, tackle the obstacles that might emerge on the road in 
the future? Thank you. 
  [Clinton] Of course, it stumbles every now and then because 
it's difficult to do. If it were easy to do, it would have been 
done before. The parties have been at odds with each other for 
a long time, there was a lot of mistrust to overcome, there are 
a lot of details to be worked out. And, I think whenever there 
is any ambiguity at all, or uncertainty, then that is likely to 
lead to other problems down the road. So, there are lots of 
reasons why it happens. What the United States is trying to do 
is to take advantage of what I think is an appropriate moment in 
history, where you have leaders committed to getting this 
done--leaders who understand that the interests of their people 
will be served over the long run by comprehensive peace. And so 
what we can do, I think, is to try to keep the process going, 
keep the trust level up among the parties, try to be an honest 
broker and work through the problems, and when these 
difficulties do arise, as they have as you implied in the 
aftermath of the PLO-Israel accord, to try to help and work 
through them as quickly as possible and get things back on track. 
  [Reporter, in English] Thank you. 
  [Clinton] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Policy of Deceit and 
Procrastination Conflicts With the World Community's Will," 
AL-BA'TH writes: Everyone agrees that the Geneva summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton has produced very 
positive results that will give a strong boost to help the peace 
process move toward its objectives to achieve the just and 
comprehensive peace in the region. 
  The paper adds: Geneva summit confirmed that peace can be 
genuine only if it is comprehensive and based on the UN 
resolutions and the principles of international legitimacy and 
justice. 
  AL-BA'TH stresses that the U.S. Administration would not 
have 
convened the Geneva summit if it were not convinced of the 
importance of the Syria role in the peace process; a role which 
President Clinton said is crucial to achieve a genuine peace in 
the Middle East. 
  The paper adds: Political quarters and the media agree that 
the Geneva summit undoubtedly dotted the i's and crossed the t's 
to ensure a new launch for the peace process. This is 
particularly the case when leader al-Asad reaffirmed Syria's 
certain and firm determination to establish a just and 
comprehensive peace on all tracks. 
  The paper stresses that the lessons of ancient and 
contemporary history, as emphasized by President al-Asad, 
confirm that separate peace and partial solution cannot 
guarantee a genuine peace. Leader al-Asad very clearly 
expressed Syria's firm belief that the just and comprehensive 
peace is a necessity for everyone when he said: We seek a just 
and comprehensive peace as a strategic option that guarantees 
Arab rights, terminates the Israeli occupation, and enables all 
the region's peoples to live in peace, security, and dignity. 
  For his part, U.S. President Clinton was clear in his 
support 
of President Hafiz al-Asad's view on the peace process when the 
U.S. President publicly acknowledged three matters raised by 
President al-Asad: Syria's principal role, which Clinton 
considered a key to peace; that the peaceful settlement should 
be comprehensive and not partial; and his administration's 
desire to push forward the Syrian-U.S. relations to a new, more 
important level. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: The Geneva summit has provided 
a new and rare opportunity to find a just and comprehensive 
peace. Israel, as the media and political quarters feel, should 
make a clear and candid stand away from the methods of deceit 
and procrastination which it pursues to avoid the dues of the 
just and comprehensive peace. 
  Within the same context, AL-THAWRAH says in a commentary: 
The world was right when it considered Presidents 
al-Asad-Clinton Geneva summit a historic event that will produce 
an equally important results. From the statements made by 
President Hafiz a-Asad and Bill Clinton, the world has learned 
again that the Syria's position on peace and the peace process 
is unequivocal; it is a clear position, based on objective 
principles and absolute commitment to the foundations of the 
peace process and the Madrid formula, as well as the pertinent 
resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of 
land for peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: The emphasis laid by the Geneva summit on 
the importance of the comprehensive peace and the achievement of 
that peace banks on the implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace and 
returning to Lebanon its occupied southern part. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses that this emphasis will help put the 
peace process back on its normal course, provided that Israel 
abandons the policy of intransigence and provided that, as 
President al-Asad has said, the Israeli rulers show enough 
courage to respond favorably to a genuine peace based on justice 
and comprehensiveness. 
  The paper adds: With the Geneva summit, the Arab position 
has scored a historic triumph represented by this summit's 
results and contribution toward affirming the credibility of the 
Arab position, guaranteeing the rights of all Arabs, and 
exposing the evasive nature of the Israeli policy. This would 
not have been possible without President al-Asad's extraordinary 
negotiating skills, his ability to convince others of the 
justness of the Arab causes, and an unlimited ability to 
represent Arabs and protect their national rights. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Activating the peace 
process, which is the main objective of the Geneva summit, was a 
subject of clear and full agreement between the summiteers. The 
statements by Presidents al-Asad and Clinton confirmed the 
importance of the comprehensive peace and the U.S. President 
stressed the importance of Syria's crucial role in peace and the 
peace process. 
  On the same subject, and under the headline "Summit of 
Success," TISHRIN says in an editorial: President Hafiz al-Asad 
did not need more political fame or credit or more spotlights 
when he went to Geneva. With his persistent efforts and 
principled positions and wisdom, he managed to win such things 
before Geneva. Despite the distorted balance of powers in the 
world and despite the deteriorating Arab situation, al-Asad 
managed to make the world acknowledge Syria's pioneering role in 
the region and the peace process. 
  The paper adds: If it were not for al-Asad, the summit would 
not have been convened in the first place. Nor would the summit 
have been convened on the basis of a precise parity between the 
two parties. 
  The paper adds: Syria's standing was high before the Geneva 
summit. It grew even bigger after the summit. In his 
statement, President Clinton said more than once that Syria has 
a crucial role in the region and that it would not be possible 
to achieve peace in the region without Damascus or President 
Hafiz al-Asad, who insists on playing a leading role in the 
peace process. 
  The paper stresses that the Geneva summit has achieved a 
major success because it gave credibility to the thesis of the 
just and comprehensive peace and opened a new chapter in 
relations between Damascus and Washington. 
  The paper notes that the summit has strengthened the world's 
confidence in Syria's central and crucial role in the region and 
foiled all attempts to encroach on Syria's weight and positions. 
  The paper notes that the summit provided a valuable 
opportunity to build ties of mutual confidence and respect 
between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: President al-Asad went to 
Geneva carrying the burden of the entire Arab cause. He 
returned with his head high because he protected the nation's 
dignity, strengthened its self-confidence, and revived its hopes 
in the possibility of regaining its usurped rights.

  [Text] Damascus, 17 Jan (SANA) -- The newspaper TISHRIN has 
asserted that the summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and 
Bill Clinton has revived hopes for peace and shown the road to 
stability in the Middle East and the possibility of establishing 
genuine, firm, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region. 
  In its editorial today, the paper says that establishing a 
firm, durable peace in the Middle East does not depend on Syria 
alone. Israel must also show a response, after the United States 
has pledged to make tireless efforts to settle the Arab-Israeli 
conflict in line with the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. 
  The paper asks Israel to make the "difficult decisions" that 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has often spoken about. It 
also urges Israel to end aggression and occupation because they 
contradict all principles and values of civilized humanity and 
because peace and occupation can never coexist. 
  AL-BA'TH says that the Geneva summit has proven beyond doubt 
that President al-Asad cares for Arab rights and truly seeks a 
just and comprehensive peace in this region. 
  In its editorial today, the paper adds that this truly 
embodies the constants of an approach and way of thinking that 
has never considered relinquishing any rights. 
  The paper questions Israel's intransigent position at a time 
when the Geneva summit has emphasized the achievement of a just 
and comprehensive peace, which is now a pressing international 
demand for our region. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: Now that the Geneva summit is over, eyes 
will turn toward what the U.S. Administration will do to fulfill 
its commitments, namely, working to achieve genuine peace in the 
region based on international resolutions and the land-for-peace 
principle. 
  In its commentary today, AL-THAWRAH says that the Geneva 
summit has resuscitated the peace process on the foundations on 
which it was originally launched, supported by an 
across-the-board Arab and international acknowledgment of 
Syria's central, decisive role in the region and in the peace 
process. 
  The paper thinks that the positive, honorable results of the 
Geneva summit have revived hopes for achieving a just and 
comprehensive peace in line with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. 
  AL-THAWRAH asserts that Israel's response to a just and 
comprehensive peace and its requirements will herald a new era 
in the region. 
  The paper concludes: It is the moment of truth. Peace and 
occupation can not coexist. This is an important result of the 
Geneva summit that will turn into concrete reality if Israel 
responds to the voice of peace that has again rung out loud from 
Geneva.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] On the eve of the summit, 
Syrian Information Minister Muhammad Salman alluded to the 
pressures started by the Zionist to belittle the importance of 
this summit. Salman said that the sudden revelations about 
scandals to harm the person of President Clinton have suddenly 
surfaced in the defamation media on the eve of the summit and 
are merely open operations of blackmail aimed at intimidating 
the U.S. President and forcing him to remain committed to the 
Israeli logic during his talks with President al-Asad, as the 
Syrian minister put it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Khaddam: Syria Has No Ambitions. </F>
Stability Extricates Lebanon from Intensive Care"] 
  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Syrian Vice President 
'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam has said that "Lebanon can recover its 
economic role and prosperity within a short period if it has 
complete stability coupled with the existence of a state 
supported by everyone." He added: "Lebanon is still in 
intensive care and will not be able to be moved from it unless 
stability is achieved. And the Lebanese people's interests lie 
in the building of a strong and capable state." He stressed 
that "Syria has no ambitions in Lebanon." 
  Khaddam was speaking to a delegation from the [Lebanese] 
Chamber of Commerce and the Lebanese Banks Association headed by 
'Adnan al-Qassar, which visited Damascus the day before 
yesterday [12 January] at the invitation of the Syrian Chambers 
of Commerce and Industry Federation to discuss ways of 
reinforcing economic relations between the two countries in the 
implementation of brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination. 
  The Syrian vice president pointed out that "there are many 
things which prompt the Lebanese and the Syrians to cooperate. 
And if peace is established in the region, Israel's aim will be 
to control economic, tourist, and other resources; the Arabs 
will become a consumer market for it; and it will become an 
agent for the big economic establishments. In the West there 
are no friendships, but interests, and the quarter close to the 
West's interests is Israel." 
  Khaddam said that "the big loser from that will be those who 
have money and Lebanon, because Lebanon is the most competitive 
country, and if Israel hits this center, the scene will become 
vacant for it. This is why attempts to strain the situation in 
Lebanon cannot be excluded from this context." 
  He said: "But if peace is not established in the region, the 
world economic situation is moving toward forming blocs and 
economic groupings, while our problem in the Arab states is that 
we behave as though each state is a world superpower. If we had 
established a common Arab market when the idea first emerged, we 
would have attained unity by now. And if Lebanon and Syria can 
proceed together -- even through a modest experiment -- in this 
connection, this would serve the interests of the two countries 
and the other Arab states. We are open to anything that 
achieves this aim." 
  He added that "Syria has achieved major advances in 25 
years, 
even in the petroleum field, because we know what we are doing 
and what we are going to achieve. We have no ambitions in 
Lebanon. We must take the interests of the two countries into 
account and act on that basis. Our common interests are in our 
Arab affiliation. If we do not correct our relations -- 
political and economic -- there will be no Arab homeland." 
  He pointed out that "Lebanon can recover its status and 
prosperity quickly, because of the Lebanese people's flexibility 
and broad experience. But that cannot be achieved without the 
existence of a state. This state cannot be brought about unless 
everyone contributes to bolstering it. There are attempts to 
disrupt the situation in Lebanon. Recent security bombings are 
part of these attempts. In the end they all serve Israel's 
interests. Lebanon is still in intensive care, and today we see 
in it for the first time a serious attempt to build a state and 
enable the institutions to play their roles. The Lebanese 
people's interests lie in building a strong and capable state. 
If Lebanon does not have the stability, it will not be able to 
move out of intensive care." 
  He stressed "bolstering the Lebanese state and putting 
Syria's capabilities at its disposal to restore stability and 
begin the building stage in Lebanon." He said that "any 
cooperation between the private sectors in Lebanon and Syria is 
a national demand which we support with all our capabilities."

<F P=106> [Interview with Nasir Qaddur, minister of state for foreign </F>
affairs, by Murad Fathi in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] [Fathi] What do you make of the threats issued by 
Turkish officials to Syria over the water issue.? 
  [Qaddur] There are no threats, strictly speaking. Turkey is 
a neighbor, and Turkish officials understand we will not bow to 
threats. On a government-to-government level, the two sides are 
interested in developing friendly relations. Some Turkish 
journalists, however, sometimes level charges over one issue or 
another. In the meantime, the Turkish Government has pointed 
out that these charges are not necessarily representative of its 
policies. Turkey is as willing as we are to improve our 
bilateral ties. As for the Euphrates, which originates in 
Turkish territory and traverses Syrian territory before it ends 
in Iraq, it has been an international waterway for thousands of 
years, on the banks of which many civilizations have flourished. 
In accordance with international rules regulating the use of 
river waters, the three countries are all rightful claimants. 
Hence, the existence of three-way technical committees working 
on the water distribution. In 1987, we reached an agreement 
with the Turks under which Turkey committed itself to the 
allocation of 500 cubic meters per second for Syria before the 
Ataturk Dam is filled. A clause in a protocol signed during 
former Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's visit to Syria on 20 
January, 1993 provided for an even greater amount than that. 
  [Fathi] Will Syria give assurances to Israel of a share in 
the water once peace in the Middle East is established? 
  [Qaddur] The Golan is Syrian territory. Israel has been 
stealing water from the Golan and south Lebanon. The Israelis 
are estimated to be misappropriating an annual 300 million cubic 
meters from the Golan, which is Syrian territory. Syria needs 
the water. Future water projects will try to utilize technology 
for optimum use of the water. This is because the water 
reserves are not enough to meet Syria's requirements. We have 
irrigation and electricity projects in the east of the country, 
and any shortfall in the water will result in the depopulation 
of the area. Syria does not have enough water to spare for 
Israel. As for assurances to Israel, when peace comes and 
Israel vacates the occupied Arab territories, mechanisms will be 
created to handle cooperation among the countries of the region. 
It is premature to talk, at this point in time, about 
cooperation and guarantees to Israel. 
  [Fathi] After the Palestinian-Israeli agreement was 
signed, and after the PLO violated the Arab coordination, to 
what extent can Arab coordination, particularly among the 
parties concerned with the peace process, be achieved? 
  [Qaddur] No doubt, this agreement caused a huge rift in the 
coordination among the states participating in the negotiations. 
We believe that the unity of Arab ranks will serve the peace 
process, and that any breakthrough on a single track will 
complicate this process and will have negative repercussions on 
it. This is because we are trying to establish a comprehensive 
and just peace. Therefore, there should be a unified Arab 
position. A strong partner will make peace, but a weak one will 
make war. Syria always works to achieve at least the minimum 
requirements of the ongoing peace process. 
  [Fathi] Will you go to the 12th round of negotiations? 
  [Qaddur] We are committed to the peace process, to which we 
have been a party since the beginning, in accordance with the 
bases of the Madrid conference. These bases were agreed upon 
through elaborate discussions with the former U.S. 
Administration. Eleven rounds of talks were held, during which 
there was complete Arab coordination. Therefore, there has been 
a true orientation toward peace. Syria is still committed to 
coordination. However, it seems that Israel is so far 
unprepared for peace and is not sincere about it. Israel is 
behind the delay of the 12th session. It justifies this by the 
need for time to digest the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. In 
fact, Israel wants to usurp more Arab rights. We are ready to 
go to Washington on the condition that we receive confirmed 
guarantees about the achievement of progress during the next 
round. 
  [Fathi] How can progress be achieved during the next phase? 
  [Qaddur] If we return to the Madrid formula, we will find 
that the objective is to achieve a comprehensive peace on all 
fronts of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Madrid formula is not 
aimed at achieving bilateral solutions between Israeli and Arab 
parties. The goal is a comprehensive peace binding all parties 
to the conflict. This is what will end the conflict and return 
rights to their owners. The mechanism for attaining this goal 
is negotiations on all Arab tracks with Israel. The mission of 
the Syrian-Israeli track is to discuss the issue of the occupied 
Golan. Other tracks discuss other bilateral issues. The final 
outcome of these tracks will be a comprehensive peace. 
Isolating and ensnaring any Arab party into an agreement with 
Israel will disturb the Madrid formula and will weaken the Arab 
position, especially with regard to the issue of coordination. 
In the long run, this will not be in the service of peace. 
  [Fathi] What about reports of secret contacts between Syria 
and Israel? 
  [Qaddur] Peace is a noble goal, and it does not need any 
secret agreements. No one has to be ashamed of it. Yet, there 
was secrecy about the eleven rounds of the Washington talks. 
The problems that were discussed during the negotiations were 
not divulged. This was considered secrecy. Approximately 7,000 
pages were written in such secrecy. 
  [Fathi] How do you assess the progress on the Syrian-Israeli 
track so far? 
  [Qaddur] We can say that Israel is still far away from the 
requirements of peace. Whenever the two delegations reach the 
main point, namely, total withdrawal from the Golan, the 
Israelis start talking about the fruits of peace. The Israelis 
have not shown any signs that they will withdraw from the Golan. 
They have not said they are ready to carry out a total 
withdrawal from the Golan, although they know that Syria will 
not relinquish any inch of its land. Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338 are the basis for the peace process. 
Israel entered the negotiations aware of this. These two 
resolutions stipulate Israel's withdrawal from all the 
territories that were occupied in 1967. 
  [Fathi] There is much talk about Egypt's role in the peace 
negotiations. How do you view that role? 
  [Qaddur] The Egyptian minister of state for foreign affairs 
has said that Egypt is an Arab state and is not, as some Western 
papers are saying, playing the role of a mediator. Egypt is not 
playing the role of a mediator but is an Arab party, like Syria 
and other Arab parties, that is seeking peace in the region. It 
has more freedom than some Arab parties due to the state of its 
international relations. It is an Arab country and it is eager 
to preserve Arab rights. There is a wide-scale coordination 
between Syria and Egypt on the highest level, especially between 
President Hafiz al-Asad and President Husni Mubarak, to achieve 
a comprehensive and just peace. This is an aspect of the 
distinguished relations between the two countries.

  [Text] Damascus, Jan 14 (AFP) -- Only 225 Syrian Jews are 
still waiting to get exit visas from the authorities, the head 
of Syria's Jewish community said Friday [14 January]. 
  Rabbi Ibrahim Hamra told AFP the authorities began issuing 
visas to Jews about three weeks ago, at the rate of 30 a day. 
  "Only 225 Syrian Jews still have not received their exit 
visas," he said. "We hope they will get them in the next few 
days." 
  Some 1,250 of Syria's 4,000-strong Jewish community opted to 
stay in Syria after Damascus agreed in 1992 to allow applicants 
for exit visas to leave with their families. 
  About 1,000 remained in Damascus, and 250 in Aleppo and 
al-Qamishli in the north. 
  Hamra said none of those who emigrated went to Israel. 
Almost all of them went to New York. 
  On Monday, Hamra said that around 110 Jews had returned 
after 
spending more than a year in the United States. 
  For years the United States has urged Syria to allow its 
Jews 
to leave. 
  Damascus previously barred families from travelling together 
and required individuals who did leave to put up large sums as 
guarantees against their return. 
  However, in December Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad assured 
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher that Damascus would 
speed up the issuing of exit visas for Jews.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Children of our people in the wounded Syria, 
children of our glorious Arab nation: Was the Geneva summit 
between al-Asad and Clinton, which lasted for over five hours, a 
meeting [liqa'] or an encounter [iltiqa']? Is there a 
difference between a meeting and an encounter? Yes there is. 
Hafiz al-Asad did not go to meet with Clinton. He went to 
Geneva to have an encounter. Meeting is between two parties each 
of which has a specific position and opinion on the issues under 
discussion. An encounter is between two parties that agree on 
positions, opinions, and views under discussion or disputed 
issues. 
  From the first moment of that encounter, observers noted 
there was a full agreement in views and positions. If this 
conclusion is not new to our people in Syria and the Arab world 
in general, it does at least put an end to what was said in 
certain Arab and Western capitals to the effect that Hafiz 
al-Asad has something to say to Bill Clinton. Hired and yellow 
[signifying anti-Arab] media hinted, or even stated decidedly, 
that Hafiz al-Asad would propose to Clinton solutions to our 
problems and issues out of concern for our national and pan-Arab 
issues, the most important of which is the Arab's central cause, 
the Palestine question, and withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
and South Lebanon as stipulated by UN Security Council 
resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. 
  "The peace of the brave" is a term that was uttered 
repeatedly by Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad, but neither of 
them said what it means. The "just and comprehensive peace" was 
also uttered repeatedly by Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad, also 
without explaining what they mean by it. 
  Bilateral ties and removing anything obstructing their 
improvement and progress between al-Asad's regime and the U.S. 
Administration was Hafiz al-Asad's main concern for the past 
four years. He did not want to be bypassed by the new world 
order, the order of hegemony and control which the United States 
is trying to impose on the world under the current imbalance. 
Consequently, during that period Hafiz al-Asad did everything 
to please the U.S. Administration. He even went so far as to 
send Syrian Armed Forces to stand by the side of the 
U.S.-Atlantic forces in Hafar al-Batin trenches to launch a 
flagrant, treacherous aggression against fraternal Iraq. 
  In Geneva, and from the start, Hafiz al-Asad was nominated a 
representative and a faithful defender of the U.S. and Zionist 
interests. 
  Lockerbie, terrorism, narcotics, and Lebanon are cases with 
which the U.S. Administration used to threaten Hafiz al-Asad's 
regime. They will all be closed after Hafiz al-Asad confirmed 
his good conduct and intentions toward the U.S. and Zionist 
interests and his constant readiness to be the obedient executer 
of all that he is asked to do in the forthcoming phase, the 
phase of normalization and entry into the Zionist age, the age 
of submission and capitulation and the burning of all false, 
shining slogans on liberation, progress, development, and 
defending the pan-Arab interests. 
  Therefore, what happened in Geneva was not a meeting, but an 
encounter and a full agreement in views, directions, and 
conduct. The Geneva summit between Clinton and al-Asad marks a 
new phase that has its own characters and features. It will 
certainly be the phase of openness and publicity and the phase 
of full agreement and harmony between al-Asad's regime, the 
Zionist enemy, and the U.S. Administration to humiliate our 
nation, subjugate it, and plunder its wealth. However, Clinton 
and al-Asad have forgotten that the will of the free peoples 
cannot be tied to what the agents and the usurper enemies agree 
upon.

  [Text] Baghdad, 17 Jan (INA)--President Saddam Husayn has 
attended a mammoth mass rally in the Salah-al-Din Governorate, 
which was held on the third anniversary of the treacherous 
30-state aggression against our mujahid country. 
  The citizens, who were carrying their personal weapons, 
applauded the president, may God preserve him, expressed their 
readiness to defend the achievements of the great revolution, 
and renewed their support for the brave leadership of President 
Saddam Husayn. Thousands of citizens greeted his excellency and 
voiced their full loyalty to the beloved one and the people's 
brave leader. 
  The masses of the governorate expressed their anger over and 
denunciation of the cowardly aggressive action against our 
developing country and the building of a new Iraq. 
  Muhammad Yunus al-Ahmad, member of the Iraq Command of the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and official in charge of the party's 
organizations in the governorates of al-Anbar and Salah-al-Din, 
and Ghazi Ahmad Khattab, Salah-al-Din governor, attended the 
mass rally.

Arab League that the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers have continued to 
provide facilities to U.S., British, and French aircraft to 
violate the Iraqi airspace, noting that this seriously 
jeopardizes Iraq's security, sovereignty, and national unity. 
  In a letter addressed to the Arab League secretary general 
yesterday, the Iraqi permanent representative to the Arab League 
said that the aforementioned aircraft continued on 10-13 January 
to violate the Iraqi airspace, flying from bases in Saudi Arabia 
and Kuwait. They carried out 176 hostile air sorties on the 
aforementioned dates. 
  A list attached to the letter detailed these violations.

  [Text] New York, 16 Jan (INA)--Iraq has again lodged a 
protest with the United Nations over the U.S. aircraft's 
continued violation of the Iraqi airspace for purposes of 
surveillance, harassment, and flare-dropping. 
  In a letter addressed to the UN secretary general yesterday, 
the Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations said 
that the aforementioned aircraft continued on 1-9 January to 
violate the Iraqi airspace. They carried out 473 hostile air 
sorties on the aforementioned dates when they overflew several 
areas in Iraq. Besides, some squadrons of the U.S. aircraft 
dropped flares over several areas in the Ninawa Governorate. 
  The Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations 
requested that the letter be circulated among the UN Security 
Council members, and deemed a UN Security Council document.

  [Text] After observing and monitoring the movements of 
Saddam's security forces in al-Basrah Governorate, the Islamic 
resistance forces last week set up ambushes on the road between 
the district of (al-Mdaynah) and the area of (al-Nasri) which 
belong to the Governorate of al-Basrah. Our sources affirmed 
that the resistance ambushes opened fire when the tyrant's 
security forces passed the above-mentioned road. They said that 
a fierce battle ensued between the resistance groups and the 
regime's security forces. A number of soldiers and officers 
from the tyrant's security forces were killed and the rest 
withdrew, dragging their tails behind them. The Islamic 
resistance forces returned to their bases safely.

  [Text] Retaliating for the regime forces' criminal 
practices against the inhabitants of the marshlands in southern 
Iraq, the Islamic resistance forces last week carried out a 
heroic operation against regime forces and artillery at the IV 
Army Corps command near the city of al-'Amarah. Our sources 
said that in its courageous attack, the Islamic resistance used 
120mm mortars against the regime's artillery batteries, 
ammunition, and personnel positions, leaving the regime forces 
horrified and unable to move. Our sources said the regime 
suffered heavy human and material losses. Eyewitnesses said 
they saw columns of flames from far away and heard explosions of 
ammunition in the storehouses for 48 hours. 
  After the operation, our sources added, the regime placed 
all 
its forces in the south on maximum alert and closed main and 
secondary roads linking al-'Amarah with the other governorates 
in the south. The regime forces also launched extensive searches 
for the heroes of the Islamic resistance, who returned safely to 
base. 
  It should be mentioned that large areas of al-'Amarah 
marshlands were targeted by the regime's large-caliber artillery 
deployed at the IV Army Corps command near the city of 
al-'Amarah. The shelling destroyed hundreds of houses, caused 
heavy property damage, and forced thousands of people to leave 
their homes in the marshlands and seek refuge in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and in other regions inside Iraq.

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 16 (AFP)--French lawmakers on Sunday 
ended talks in Baghdad, promising to work on their return for 
lifting UN sanctions imposed on Iraq more than three years ago, 
the delegation said. 
  European Parliament member and former French army 
chief-of-staff Jeannou Lacaze told AFP the delegation would 
strive for a lifting of the embargo slapped on Iraq four days 
after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. 
  General Lacaze, who described his talks with Iraqi officials 
as "very positive," said the delegation would "present several 
proposals reflecting the Iraqi viewpoint," but gave no details 
on the issues to be raised. 
  He said his team supported an easing of restrictions, 
notably 
on medical products. The delegation had decided to donate five 
tonnes of powdered milk to Iraqi infants, he added. 
  The French delegation, which leaves Monday for Amman, met 
Sunday with Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khudayyir and 
parliamentary speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih. 
  A French official said Friday the visit was "a personal 
initiative and that it does not commit the French authorities" 
or represent a change in policy towards Iraq. 
  He added that France was still for Iraq's implementation of 
United Nations Security Council resolutions on disarmament. 
  Franco-Iraqi ties were severed at Baghdad's initiative 
during 
the Gulf crisis to protest France's participation in the 
international coalition that ousted Iraq from Kuwait after seven 
months of occupation. 
  Iraqi newspapers reported Friday that Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq 'Aziz had discussed the possibility of restoring 
diplomatic ties between Baghdad and Paris with the lawmakers. 
  The delegation, which arrived Thursday, was led by Senator 
Serge Mathieu, head of the Franco-Iraqi Friendship Association. 
  It also held talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id 
al-Sahhaf.

  [Text] India today reiterated its stand that there is need 
to alter the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as it is 
discriminatory in its present form. Reacting to the U.S.-Russia 
joint declaration issued in Moscow yesterday at the end of the 
summit talks, New Delhi perceives that the basic orientation of 
the declaration echoed the objectives emphasized by India at the 
United Nations. 
  A statement issued by the External Affairs Ministry 
spokesman 
said that while India wants objectives of comprehensive test ban 
pursued expeditiously within a specified timeframe, it should be 
applicable to all members of the international community. In 
view of this, New Delhi has pursued confidence building measures 
with its neighbors and participated in a series of bilateral 
discussions with different countries. However, as far as a 
suggestion of the Moscow declaration that the NPT should be 
extended indefinitely and unconditionally in the present form, 
New Delhi is of the view that it needs to be altered on 
nondiscriminatory lines. It should take into account 
international developments of the last three decades and the 
imperative necessity for complete disarmament to end all weapons 
of mass destruction. 
  The declaration issued after the talks between Mr. Bill 
Clinton and Mr. Boris Yeltsin said that the two countries will 
support efforts to set up a multilateral forum to deal with 
nonproliferation problems in South Asia. It also called upon 
India and Pakistan to join the treaty banning nuclear tests and 
the proposed convention on banning the production of materials 
for nuclear arms.

  [Text] The sixth Commonwealth parliamentary seminar opened 
in New Delhi today with a call for refining the system. 
Inaugurating the seminar, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha 
Rao, said no country can afford complacency about the drawbacks 
of the system though there is room for satisfaction. He said 
parliaments have to adapt themselves with the pace of the 
growing change in contemporary society. It is the will of the 
people and, therefore, it should articulate their aspirations. 
He said parliamentary democracy will succeed when it addresses 
the agenda of the nation. Listing the recent steps taken in 
India, Mr. Rao said several parliamentary committees have been 
formed to ensure accountability of the executive. Any Indian 
parliament member can now identify the urgent needs of the 
people of his constituency and suggest schemes up to one crore 
rupees. Mr. Rao also said that parliament and press should 
complement each other. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Mr. Rao called 
upon parliamentarians to recall the face of the poorest man they 
met ever and ask whether the steps they plan are going to 
benefit him. 
  Welcoming the delegates, the Lok Sabha speaker, Mr. Shivraj 
Patil, emphasized the need to discover devices to cope with 
numerous problems faced by the people. While the parliamentary 
system works on the basis of majority's views it will become 
less productive if the aspirations of the minority are 
neglected. Mr. Patil also called for striking a balance to make 
multiparty democracy meaningful. 
  The deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, Dr. Najma 
Heptulla, emphasized the need for stability of a parliamentary 
system domestically to ensure the stability of the world order. 
  The seminar will discuss among other things the need to 
reform parliamentary system and the roles of presiding officers 
and the opposition. The nine-day seminar is being attended by a 
number of delegates from home and abroad including the former 
speaker of the House of Commons of Britain, Lord (Wheteral). 
  Later, participating in a discussion on parliamentary system 
in India, the secretary general of the Commonwealth 
Parliamentary Association [CPA], Mr. Arthur (Donahue), commended 
India's democratic system. He said the CPA is taking steps to 
monitor the forthcoming elections in South Africa. Former union 
minister and Janata Dal leader, Mr. I.K. Gujral, in his speech 
said Indian parliament, by and large, has ensured accountability 
of the government to the people.

elsewhere. Various groups of the Republican Party also hailed 
the decision and described it as a progressive step. The CPM 
[Communist Party of India-Marxist], the CPI [Communist Party of 
India] and the Janata Dal have also welcomed the decision.

<F P=106> [By Madhu Nainan] </F>
  [Text] Bombay, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Police braced for more 
trouble Monday [17 Jan] in Maharashtra as a militant Hindu 
leader planned to tour areas of the state hit by rioting over 
the renaming of a university after a crusader of India's 
untouchables. 
  Sporadic violence continued for a third day in eight of the 
western state's 30 districts where arson and rioting snowballed 
after the Maharashtra administration renamed a unversity after 
the leader of low-caste Hindus. 
  High-caste Hindus outraged by the move on Monday set ablaze 
an engineering workshop, a dam site and several schools in 
Parbani district and torched a government veterinary hospital in 
Jalna district, witnesses said. 
  The attackers hurled rocks at state buses and private cars, 
forcing vehicles off the roads. Several Hindu and Buddhist 
temples also came under attack as tension rose in the eight 
districts torn by caste-strife, witnesses said. 
  Train and bus services remained disrupted because of attacks 
by upper-caste Hindus protesting the renaming of Marathwada 
university after Baba Sahib Ambedkar, leader of the 
socially-oppressed low-caste Hindus. 
  Police stepped up patrols to prevent violence from spilling 
into new areas. 
  Police also prepared to block a visit later Monday by Hindu 
fundamentalist leader Bal Thackeray to the city of Aurangabad, 
site of the rechristened university. 
  Thackeray is the leader of the Shiv Sena, whose members have 
been at the forefront of the violence which erupted Friday [14 
Jan] after Maharashtra chief minister Sharad Pawar renamed the 
university. 
  Police said they had blocked all entry points to Aurangabad 
to ensure that Thackeray does not reach the city. They have 
banned the visit by the firebrand Hindu leader, amid fears it 
would spark large-scale unrest. 
  "Nobody is above the law," senior police officer Mahesh 
Narayan Singh said when asked whether Thackeray would be 
arrested. He also asserted that there was no violence on Monday 
in Marathwada district. 
  On Sunday, Shiv Sena militants and upper-caste Hindus 
torched 
a veterinary hospital, a police station, two schools and a Dalit 
shanty town and attacked government buses and offices in 
Marathwada. 
  No casualties were reported in the attacks. 
  Shiv Sena sources said Thackeray plans to lead a rally 
Tuesday in Aurangabad to protest the renaming of Marathwada 
university after the author of the Indian constitution. 
  Ambedkar is lionised by lower-caste Hindus, who are called 
Dalits or "downtrodden" -- those at the lowest rung of the Hindu 
caste ladder. 
  If Thackeray is arrested, Shiv Sena activists would fan out 
into villages to carry out "disruptive activities," sources in 
his party said. 
  A journalist meanwhile swallowed poison and died in the town 
of Yawat Mal on Sunday [16 Jan], leaving behind a suicide note 
that said he was taking his life to protest at the renaming of 
the university. 
  Vinod Gudge was the first person to commit suicide to 
protest 
the renaming. 
  Another protestor set himself on fire in Beed district but 
survived with burns to 80 percent of his body, the MAHRASHTRA 
TIMES said. 
  Five "Dalits" had committed suicide to force the renaming of 
the university. 
  The outbreak of inter-caste violence is India's worst since 
1990, when the then premier, V.P. Singh, hiked job quotas for 
the lower castes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first deputy prime </F>
minister and foreign minister, by Buthaynah Abu-'Ubayd in Abu 
Dhabi; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Abu-'Ubayd] Kuwait has concluded defense 
treaties with the big powers, but it has failed on the Gulf and 
Arab axes. What do you have to say about this? 
  [Al-Ahmad] Who told you that it has failed. As an official, 
who is aware of the situation, I announce that it has succeeded 
on all fronts to protect its sovereignty and independence. 
Everyone knows that the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] member 
states all participated, even shed their blood, in the 
liberation of Kuwait. After liberation, we have continued to 
coordinate joint defense among the GCC states. This shows 
cooperation among these states. On the Arab front, there is no 
difference. There are Arab states that participated in the 
battle of liberation such as Egypt and Syria. After this, we 
cooperated within the framework of the Damascus Declaration. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] How true are reports about the collapse of the 
Damascus Declaration? 
  [Al-Ahmad] May God forgive us. Where did you get such an 
idea? If this is true, then we must say that all our meetings 
in the Arab world are unsuccessful. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] This year is expected to witness important 
developments in the Western stands toward Iraq. The recent 
visits by three senior Western personalities to Iraq indicate 
the possibility of ending Iraq's diplomatic isolation. Are you 
concerned about the exertion of pressure on Kuwait in this 
regard? 
  [Al-Ahmad] First of all, it saddens me to even have to deny 
any reports on the existence of pressure on Kuwait concerning 
its policy. Basically, this is something that should not be 
said. Second, these personalities' visits to Iraq took place for 
specific reasons pertaining to the release of Western hostages. 
However, we should not say that there are no interests in 
ending the isolation. However, these interests will begin when 
the problems end. From this premise, everyone now wants to 
stake claim, pending a solution of the current issues. 
  I would like to reaffirm that the diplomatic isolation 
imposed on the Iraqi regime should not be lifted for two simple 
reasons: First, If some say that Iraq has agreed to implement 
Resolution 715, which was issued as a result of the occupation 
of Kuwait, then this resolution is still linked to other 
resolutions. In this case, the implementation must be full and 
comprehensive, including all UN resolutions. As regards the 
Iraqi regime, I believe that no state should extend bridges to 
those who starve and displace their own people and carry out the 
ugliest forms of torture against them. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] Your statements in which you call for 
differentiating between the Iraqi regime and people appear 
contrary to the facts on the ground. 
  [Al-Ahmad] What you are saying is very strange. You might 
not know that Kuwait has sent relief aid to the Iraqi people, 
particularly those expelled by the Iraqi regime in the north and 
south. 
  We differentiate between the regime and the people. We hope 
we can help the people inside Iraq, because we are not pleased 
to hear that a fraternal people are being exposed to starvation 
and coercion. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] Your continuous denial of secret talks with 
"anti- Kuwait" states shows that Arab reconciliation is more 
unlikely than before, despite the continuous attempts by these 
countries and some Arabian Gulf states to bring you closer 
together with these countries. Will the coming days witness the 
success of these attempts? 
  [Al-Ahmad] I want you to answer this question: On what basis 
shall these attempts succeed and the reconciliation be achieved? 
What happened was caused by a problem. Therefore, if the 
problem ends the reconciliation will begin. If reconciliation 
takes place now it will be futile. I hope peace will prevail 
and all repercussions of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will end. 
I hope peace will be achieved. But, when? I do not know. As 
long as differences exist in the Arab world everything will 
remain unresolved. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] What is your opinion of the [Arab-Israeli 
peace] 
settlement? 
  [Al-Ahmad] Regarding the settlement, we welcomed the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement as a first step. We hope that 
agreements will be reached on all levels, otherwise, there will 
be no progress on the path to peace. 
  [Abu-'Ubayd] What will happen if this step fails? 
  [Al-Ahmad] I hope this will not happen. Even if this step 
fails, the road to peace will not be closed. This road has been 
opened and the first steps have begun. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Kuwait, 14 Jan (KUNA) -- Kuwaiti Trade and 
Industry Ministry Undersecretary Dr. Walid 'Abd-al-Muhsin 
al-Wuhayyib today left the country leading a Kuwaiti delegation 
to attend the preparatory meeting of the negotiating delegation 
consisting of the representatives of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council [GCC] member states in readiness to meet on 16 January 
with the U.S. team. Prior to his departure al-Wuhayyib stated 
that the GCC looks forward for the meeting with the U.S. side to 
lead to a document which defines the aims of these talks and a 
program of action to be realized. He pointed out that the Saudi 
minister of trade will be leading the GCC side while the U.S. 
secretary of trade will lead the American side. 
  Al-Wuhayyib added that the GCC secretariat general intends 
to 
submit the agreement on free trade exchange which was not 
accepted before by the U.S. side, but following the endorsement 
of the free trade agreement of North America, and reaching an 
agreement at the end of the Uruguay round within the GATT 
framework, "circumstances may be suitable for the submission of 
this proposal by the GCC." He also said that the unified Gulf 
delegation will discuss with the American side too the subject 
of investment and methods of encouraging it, industrial 
cooperation, science and technology and rights of individual 
ownership. He said that negotiating with a superpower such as 
the United States with a unified Gulf delegation reflects the 
cohesion of the GCC member states and reaffirms that progress is 
being made along the path of integration. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Lost Opportunity"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has wasted a valuable 
and unique opportunity to restore confidence in the role of the 
United States and to reaffirm that it is qualified to lead the 
world toward a new international order. He did this when he 
failed to wrench an approval from his partners in NATO on a 
proposal for concentrated air strikes on Bosnia that would end 
the continuous Serb attacks on Muslims. When we recall that the 
United States itself presented this proposal last August, we 
realize that the U.S. President's weakness, which was clearly 
manifested at the Brussels summit, is a result of a state of 
reluctance and confusion that prevails in the decisions and 
stands of the U.S. Administration. This U.S. Administration is 
wasting a great inheritance of military and political glory 
created by [former] President George Bush's administration when 
it stood against the Iraqi aggression on Kuwait with a sincere 
will, a brave stand, and a daring decision that put an end to 
treacherous belligerence and gave the United States the prestige 
and respect that qualifies it to lead the world after it became 
the last superpower on earth. 
  It seemed clear that during the Brussels summit, the U.S. 
President was unable to take hold of the necessary reins to make 
a strategic decision that would reinforce the credibility of the 
"president of the world" as is being touted in political 
terminology!! It is no surprise that the U.S. President has 
become a target of derision for Zhirinovskiy, the leader of 
Russian fascism, and disdain for Milosevic, the leader of the 
Serbs. The former proposed to extend a helping hand to the 
"weak" United States. The latter responded to the proposal to 
deal air strikes by intensifying the malicious fire on Sarajevo!? 
  This American retreat, which is due to tactical calculations 
and favoring regional interests at the expense of the global 
responsibilities of the last superpower, is considered 
submission to tyrants and encouragement for aggression. This 
will create new facts in the international arena. These facts 
will contribute to rekindling the fire from beneath the ashes of 
the cold war! 
  This disgraceful retreat from the decision to deter the 
aggressor, coupled with the unfair decision that equates the 
heavily armed Serb and the Muslim deprived of the right to own a 
means of self-defense, renders those who abstain from making a 
deterrent decision partners in an international conspiracy 
against Bosnia-Herzegovina and partakers in the aggression 
carried out by the criminals of the barbarian war launched by 
the Serbs in the name of old crusades and new fascism.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, Jan 17, SPA -- The Saudi newspapers 
commented today editorially on a number of topics. [passage 
omitted] 
  On Geneva talks held between the Syrian and U.S. Presidents 
yesterday, 'UKAZ, which is also published in Jeddah, said the 
meeting had earned a great importance in the view of the fact 
that Syrian and the U.S. could play a crucial role in 
realization of comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East. 
  The Arab stand is based on the international legitimacy and 
the resolutions issued by the organization of the United Nations 
as well as on the principle of land in return of peace, said the 
paper. 
  The daily criticized the endeavors of Israel to obtain Arab 
recognition and establishment of diplomatic and economic 
relations with the Arab countries before its withdrawal from the 
Arab territories. 
  The U.S. in its capacity as the sole big power in the world 
and the sponsor of the peace process in the Middle East is 
expected to put pressure on Israel until it withdraws from the 
Arab territories and recognizes the legitimate Arab rights. 
  On the same topic Jeddah-based AL-MADINAH said the summit 
conference of Geneva would enable Washington to activate its 
role as a mediator. 
  The daily underscored the importance of U.S. political 
pressure on Israel so as to pave the way for the settlement of 
the Arab- Israel dispute. 
  For its part Riyadh-based AL-JAZIRAH hoped that 
al-Asad-Clinton talks would pave the way for a real peace in the 
Middle East. 
  The Arabs believe that the U.S. is the most qualified 
country 
to play an effective and decisive role in the peace process, 
said the paper. 
  It is hoped that President al-Asad has successfully conveyed 
to Clinton the Arab demands for realization of peace, added the 
daily. 
  Ad Dammam-based AL-YA'UM deplored the Israeli maneuvers to 
escape the implementation of the international resolutions. 
  Through its maneuvers Israel is trying to obtain further 
Arab 
concessions, said the daily. It has become very clear that 
Israel will never positively respond to the peace efforts 
without effective pressure from a country like the U.S., it 
added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The following joint communique has been issued 
following the visit of Sardar Faruq Ahmad Leghari, president of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: 
  King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, the custodian of the 
two holy mosques, king of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and His 
Excellency Sardar Faruq Ahmad Khan Leghari, president of the 
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, have followed with profound 
anxiety and extreme regret the devleopment of the painful 
situation in Afghanistan resulting from the Afghan sides 
resorting to, irrespective of their orientations and 
affiliation, the factor of violence and brute force in settling 
the differences and problems between them, which has led to the 
spilling of innocent blood, killing, and destruction of 
properties. It is utterly sorrowful, regrettable, and 
disappointing to see all this taking place following the famous 
agreement which the Afghan leaders signed in the vicinity of the 
holy mosque [Mecca] and their undertaking at that time to adhere 
to what had been agreed upon at the holiest place on earth 
during the month of blessed Ramadan of last year. 
  King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the custodian of the two holy 
mosques, and His Excellency Sardar Faruq Ahmad Khan, while 
expressing their indignation at what matters in Afghanistan have 
led to -- and in a way that does not please God -- appeal to and 
demand from the Afghan leaders to fear God and arm themselves 
with wisdom and seek arbitration in the contents of the Holy 
Qur'an and the pure Sunnah of His Prophet -- may God's prayers 
and peace be upon him -- and would like at the same time to 
stress the necessity of an unconditional ceasefire and the 
halting of all attacks in all areas of Afghanistan according to 
the Agreement of Holy Mecca, which stipulates assigning an 
important role to the Islamic Conference Organization and its 
secretary general to supervise and follow-up; and to give the 
secretary general the opportunity to carry out this role and use 
his good offices to establish peace and security in Afghanistan 
and to ascertain that all sides genuinely abide by the Islamabad 
agreement signed by the Afghan leaders in the midst of Holy 
Mecca on 18th of Ramadan 1413, corresponding to 11 March 1993, 
and to abide by the stipulations of the recent Jalalabad 
agreement.

<F P=106> [By Habib Trabelsi] </F>
  [Text] Dubayy, Jan 15 (AFP) -- Yemen's rival ruling parties 
on Saturday traded charges that their respective military forces 
were massing troops on the borders of the former north and south 
Yemen, sources close to both sides said. 
  President Ali Aballah Saleh's General People's Congress 
(GPC) 
and his Vice President's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) are 
accusing each other of massing troops at the old border dividing 
the country, which was united in 1990. 
  GPC sources interviewed by telephone from Dubayy, told AFP 
that the YSP which ruled the former South Yemen had deployed its 
20th brigade at the border at dawn on Friday. The brigade, 
positioned across from the northern province of al-Baydha, had 
been based further inland in the south. 
  The GPC sources said the southern forces were bolstered 
opposite the border town of Ta'izz and that armoured vehicles 
were sent to the airport of the southern port of Aden. 
  On Thursday, the sources said that the YSP had redeployed 
four army units previously on the borders with Oman and Saudi 
Arabia to the oil region of Shabwa in the south. 
  Socialist South Yemen and the more prosperous conservative 
North united in May 1990 after three centuries of separation. 
But their armies have not yet been merged and the two leaders, 
Salih and Vice President Ali Salem al-Bid, have been locked in a 
dispute since August over how to rule the country. 
  Al-Bid, the president of the former south, left the capital 
to his home in Aden, demanding political and economic reforms. 
He refused to attend a reconciliation meeting with Salih last 
Sunday. 
  The sources contacted from Dubayy accused al-Bid's party of 
"recently using the country's oil revenues to conclude arms 
deals, notably with Bulgaria and Russia." A YSP official 
however denied the charge and held the rival party responsible 
for the military "escalation." 
  "The GPC deployed Friday several units on the old border, 
mainly the first armoured unit and the Amaliqa brigade, opposite 
the northern provinces of al-Baydha and Dhamar," the YSP source 
said. 
  In a statement Thursday, the GPC slammed the mobilisation 
and 
reinforcement of troops by the socialist party, saying it was 
against "the spirit of national unity and risked a breakout of a 
civil war." 
  The GPC sources accused the socialists of lacking interest 
in 
implementation of a plan, approved by a military committee 
headed by the deputy chief of staff, Colonel Ali Mohammad Salah, 
to withdraw both parties' forces from the old border line. 
  Jordan had accepted the committee's proposal to send an 
intervention force to Yemen to supervise the withdrawal, they 
said, but the YSP asked Amman to postpone the deployment. 
  Tension has been rising in the country since the failure of 
last Sunday's reconciliation attempt by religious mediators. 
  The Yemeni president said Wednesday he was prepared to step 
down and hand the job over to his southern rival to "safeguard 
Yemen's unity." 
  He urged his countrymen to avoid a conflict and organise a 
peaceful march from the northern town of Ta'izz to Aden, the 
capital of the former south.

  [Text] A responsible source within the General Committee of 
the General People's Congress [GPC] has stated the following: 
  We regret the statement issued by the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] Political Bureau in Aden on 15 January 1994. This 
statement contained false allegations and fabrications against 
the GPC. We will reply to these fabrications later in detail. 
However, the serious fabrications about some military moves by 
some northern governorates in the direction of previously 
divided regions is what should be explained today. 
  As usual, the YSP Political Bureau's recent statement 
reversed facts in a desperate attempt to cover up its 
mobilization of armed forces in previously divided outskirts. 
This is because it has nothing to say after the facts became 
clear to the public at home and abroad. 
  The YSP should have acted otherwise by withdrawing the 
troops 
it had massed at previously divided positions in the 
governorates of Shabwa, Abyan, and Lahd, instead of accusing 
others of doing the same thing, despite its certainty and 
knowledge that these accusations are not true. 
  The GPC, which is eager to maintain unity and safeguard the 
security of the people and the homeland, would not even think 
about moving troops or mobilizing fighters. This is because it 
feels it has responsibility toward all sons of Yemen throughout 
the country, and not only in certain governorates to the 
exclusion of others. It also feels itself responsible for the 
safety of the entire homeland, and not just certain parts. 
  The source asserted that the committee formed by the House 
of 
Representatives should embark on a fact-finding mission. Also, 
the military committee should take note of how things are 
proceeding and also do some fact-finding. Moreover, the 
expanded national dialogue committee should be aware of what is 
taking place on the ground.

  [Text] Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Jan 18 (AFP)--President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's party charged Tuesday that a southern 
Yemeni warplane bombed a northern army brigade, but the south 
denied the accusation. 
  The Russian-made MiG warplane bombed the brigade at 
al-'Amaliqah in the southern province of Abyan on Monday, 
causing enormous damage but no casualties, the spokesman for the 
General People's Congress (GPC) said. 
  He told AFP that the warplane returned to Badr air base, 
near 
the southern port city of Aden. 
  However, a spokesman at the Badr base denied the charge, 
insisting the plane was on a routine training mission.

  [Text] Political sources in Yemen think there are two main 
reasons for Yemeni Vice President al-Bid's boycott of a meeting 
last Sunday with Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in 
al-Janad Mosque in the Yemeni city of Ta'izz, which is 
surrounded by green hills. 
  The sources told AL-SHURUQ that al-Bid was not sure about 
the 
security measures. In fact, people close to him said openly 
that al-Bid had great fears that he would be a victim of a 
carefully concocted assassination attempt. The second reason is 
that if al-Bid went to Ta'izz, he would find himself in a 
hostile atmosphere. The reason for this is not President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih but the ulema, who are known for their support 
for President Salih. Despite all the recent developments, the 
ulema still regard al-Bid as a socialist and communist. 
  Whatever the reasons behind al-Bid's boycott of the meeting, 
the failure of the Ta'izz meeting has exacerbated the Yemeni 
crisis. President 'Ali Salih acknowledged this when he warned of 
"serious pitfalls facing Yemeni unity" which was realized on 22 
May 1990. 
  The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has made a meeting between 
the Yemeni president and the vice president conditional on the 
implementation of the YSP's 18 points, despite the fact that the 
General People's Congress had earlier approved those 18 points. 
This means the YSP does not plan to make any concessions and 
that al-Bid is deliberately seeking to "humiliate" 'Ali Salih to 
corner him and drive him to adopt positions and measures which 
al-Bid probably would like to see happen without himself taking 
the responsibility of declaring or adopting such measures. 
  Informed Yemeni sources told AL-SHURUQ that the telephone 
call between al-Bid and King Husayn of Jordan after canceling 
the Ta'izz meeting has left the door open to hold a meeting, but 
in a neutral venue outside Yemen and after complying with new 
conditions set by al-Bid.

  [Text] The House of Representatives held a meeting this 
morning under the chairmanship of House Speaker brother Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar and in the presence of First 
Deputy Prime Minister brother Dr. Hasan Muhammad Makki and the 
cabinet members. At the beginning of the meeting, the House of 
Representatives speaker welcomed the first deputy prime minister 
and the cabinet members and delivered a valuable speech in which 
he said: I would like to express my happiness and that of 
people's deputies to welcome you at the beginning of this 
meeting in the new year, which we hope will bring prosperity and 
stability for our people who have suffered much as a result of 
certain whims and desires and the placement of personal 
interests over public ones. 
  Brothers: We in this House hoped that we would be able to go 
ahead with our legislative and control duties within the 
framework of the Constitution and the law, backed by everybody's 
belief in the need to save the country from its difficulties and 
problems. The problems have accumulated since the hateful eras 
of division and the ensuing unnatural transitional period that 
our people decided to end on 27 April 1993. They did this by 
holding general elections that reflected the honesty of the 
people and registered a wonderful achievement of cohesion among 
the individuals of the society who took part in the elections. 
It also silenced many tongues and refuted many speculations. 
  House of Representatives speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar added: The general elections experience in 
our country produced a new political fact, which everybody had 
to respect because the results of these elections represented 
the will of the whole people for the first time in the history 
of unified Yemen. But regrettably, some people have changed 
their intentions, and their words now contradict their actions. 
This forced the House to face some difficulties in carrying out 
its constitutional duties. Yet, the House has played its 
national role in preserving the people's interests and gains, 
represented by unity, democracy, and political pluralism, and 
also exerted its utmost effort to support the coalition 
government to carry out its executive duties since it won the 
House of Representatives' confidence in accordance with the 
statement it submitted and in light of the House's comment on it. 
  It was natural for the coalition government to immediately 
carry out the contents of its statement. As part of its special 
duties, the House commented on the statement and drew up 
timetables for it to be carried out. If we want to review the 
government's commitments from the day it won confidence on 2 
August 1993 through the rest of the year, we will not be able to 
explain them all. However, we refer to the main duties: 
  1. Merging the Armed Forces and the Security Forces on 
national bases. 
  2. Unifying all legislation and submitting draft laws to 
the House. 
  3. Submitting a program for the financial, monetary, and 
supply policy, in addition to a report on the economic and 
financial situation of the state. 
  4. Presenting the draft general state budget for 1994 two 
months before the beginning of the financial year. 
  5. Providing the required foreign currency to import 
basic commodities. 
  All this was frozen and its execution delayed, whether with 
goodwill or not, until the political crisis emerged to double 
the tragedies and paralyze the various state departments. 
Instead of containing the negative repercussions of the crisis 
and limiting them by doubling its activity and encouraging more 
efforts by all the state departments, the government pushed 
matters in the opposite direction. This prompted the House of 
Representatives in its meeting on 10 January 1994 to obligate 
the government to return employees to their offices, including 
the prime minister and the ministers; to continue the dialogue 
within the coalition; and to take its time to carry out its 
duties. 
  Concluding, House speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn 
al-Ahmar said that the House of Representatives, the guiding 
authority of the government, deeply regrets the deteriorating 
situation and the negligence the political crisis has produced 
in various areas, especially the economic area in which prices 
went up and in which the national currency deteriorated 
seriously. This prompted the House to summon the government to 
quickly discuss its statement and the House's comment on it. We 
decided to hold discussions on the following areas: 
  1. The economic and financial area. 
  2. The security and military area. 
  3. The services area. 
  4. the administrative and legal area. 
  Afterward, brother Dr. Hasan Muhammad Makki, first deputy 
prime minister, delivered the following speech: 
  Brother House of Representatives speaker, brother deputies: 
May God's peace and blessings be upon you. It gives me and the 
brother ministers pleasure to be with you in response to an 
invitation which your esteemed House extended on 13 January 1994 
and which set Monday, 17 January 1994, as a date for the 
government's attendance to hold a general debate on the 
government's policy statement and the House's reply to it in 
order to learn about the extent and level of implementing this 
statement. 
  To begin with I would like to express my deep appreciation 
for your esteemed House for the effective and constructive role 
it has played since the crisis began, and also for its full 
eagerness to contain and stop the repercussions of the crisis in 
order to safeguard the country's unity and stability. This is 
so especially since your House is the first parliamentary 
council to be elected through direct, free, and honest 
elections, which were held in all Yemeni governorates on 27 
April 1993. This House also came as an additional gain for our 
people who achieved their unity on 22 May 1990 when the Republic 
of Yemen was declared on a democratic basis. This basis is 
established on political pluralism. Through this basis, our 
people and homeland realized this historic achievement. 
  Brother House Speaker, brother deputies, we, as a coalition 
government, highly appreciate the important role your esteemed 
House has played in various legislative, constitutional, and 
political aspects by devoting most of your recent sessions to 
discussing the strangling political crisis the country is 
passing through, and also by trying to heal the rift between the 
parties to the coalition. Your invitation to the government 
truly expresses the House's care, under these regrettable 
circumstances, for the homeland's causes and concerns. 
  We regret the fact that not all ministers attended this 
session, and that only two parties in the coalition attended it. 
We were eager to respond to your invitation to attend this 
session after the brother House speaker entrusted us with doing 
so on 16 [as heard] January 1994 despite the absence of a 
coalition party, including the brother prime minister, who is 
preoccupied with political action and who left behind a host of 
major tasks as head of government. This has completely crippled 
the work of the government and all its departments and 
facilities. Moreover, difficulties were created that prevented 
the government from carrying out its role and fulfilling its 
commitments regarding the implementation of its policy 
statement, which was submitted to your esteemed House, and your 
comment on this statement, according to which the government won 
confidence. In addition, these difficulties impeded the 
constitutional tasks assigned to the government. 
  The continued absence of a party to the coalition government 
has prevented the government from accomplishing its plans and 
programs. Perhaps the most important matter was the government's 
inability to submit the 1994 state's general budget draft law on 
the constitutional date. During the 1993 fiscal year, the 
government had to work according to the 1992 budget and decided 
not to work out (?any) development or services projects. 
Moreover, we could not submit annual reports on the 
government's achievements. 
  Brother Speaker, brother Deputies: We in the government 
wished to submit to your esteemed House the replies to the 
overall questions and queries that the deputies addressed to the 
government. However, the absence of the brother prime minister 
and several ministers has prevented this. Realizing this, some 
urgent measures and arrangements were taken to handle the 
economic situation in a way that would stop the continued 
deterioration in the exchange rate and provide the basic 
commodities, which would stabilize the homeland through an 
expanded meeting comprising officials of the finance and supply 
and trade ministries, the central bank, the commercial banks 
operating in the country, and the federation of the chambers of 
commerce and industry. 
  Concluding his speech, Makki said: We affirm our full 
readiness to reply to the queries submitted to us. We hope that 
we will be given another opportunity to prepare thorough reports 
on the government's various activities and replies to your 
queries. 
  Afterward, the deputies unanimously agreed to postpone the 
general debate on the government's policy statement and the 
House's comment on it to a coming session, which would be 
attended by Prime Minister brother Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas and all ministers. 
  After the brother first deputy prime minister and ministers 
left the House's hall, the deputies discussed the issue of 
voting on Presidential Decree No. 23 of 1992 on the salaries and 
retirement allowances for the Armed Forces and security forces. 
The House decided to make a final vote in the coming session. 
It also decided to hold a special session to discuss its 
internal affairs and situation. The House will resume work 
tomorrow, Tuesday, morning, God willing.

  [Text] Sanaa, Jan 18 (AFP)--Saudi and Yemeni experts have 
resumed talks to resolve a border dispute, their seventh round 
over the past year, officials said Tuesday. 
  The meeting opened in the Yemeni capital late Monday. 
Originally scheduled for December 20, it was delayed after 
Yemen said its delegation chief, Ja'far Ba Salih, had health 
problems. 
  The Saudi team was led by Mutlab al-Nafissah. 
  In the previous six rounds, the two sides have made no 
progress, sticking to issues of procedure. 
  The border dispute centres on the provinces of Najran, Jizan 
and Assir, which came under Saudi control under an agreement 
signed in 1934. 
  Yemen wants a return of the territories, saying the 
agreement 
expired in 1992. It has refused to renew the accord.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, 16 Jan (WAKH)--Lebanese Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz has expressed pessimism over the prospects of the 
Syrian-U.S. summit, due to convene in Geneva later today, for 
Lebanon. 
  The newspaper AL-ITTIHAD, published here today, quoted the 
Lebanese minister as saying that the security situation in 
southern Lebanon, which is linked to regional considerations, 
will be discussed during the summit. This could reflect 
positively on the situation in southern Lebanon, and could 
consequently push for a solution to that issue, he noted. 
  On the peace negotiations, the Lebanese minister said that 
no 
decision to resume the negotiations has thus far been made. As 
for Lebanon's position on participation in the next round of 
negotiations, it will be decided in light of the talks held in 
Washington by the head of the Lebanese negotiating delegation, 
and the outcome of the U.S.-Syrian summit, Buwayz maintained. 
  Buwayz affirmed that nothing has changed about the U.S. 
assurances provided to Lebanon. He added that the U.S. 
Administration has not marked any departure from these 
assurances. He affirmed that there can be no solution or 
progress on the Lebanese track of negotiations unless Israel 
subscribes to complete withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese 
territories. 
  The Lebanese foreign minister accused Israel of effecting a 
military and political escalation whenever a new chapter in the 
peace process is heralded.

<F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with </F>
unidentified correspondents' after his meeting with Prime 
Minister Rafiq al-Hariri in Beirut on 17 January--recorded] 
  [Text] [Buwayz] Doubtlessly, the U.S.-Syrian summit shows 
clear indications about the future of the peace negotiations. 
The first signs coming from this summit suggest that the 
principle of achieving progress on all the negotiating tracks 
has been accepted. Formerly, there were numerous attempts to 
isolate the Arab parties and deal with each of them separately. 
The U.S.-Syrian meeting also appears to have clarified other 
basic principles of the peace process. I have said that it is 
wrong to believe that a meeting of heads of state would deal 
with details. It is also wrong to believe that such a summit 
meeting is an uncalculated adventure. In other words, I believe 
that the summit has successfully laid down general principles 
and fundamental policies in connection with the peace operation. 
I am sure that this will have a favorable effect on the 
Lebanese negotiating track [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Has there been any contact between you and 
the Syrian foreign minister? 
  [Buwayz] I believe that a meeting will be held shortly to 
clarify certain points that have not been fully outlined. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you have noted that the summit 
will have a favorable effect on the Lebanese negotiating track. 
In what way do you think this will happen? 
  [Buwayz] You know that the Lebanese negotiating track and 
the 
issue of south Lebanon, though primarily dealing with private 
Lebanese affairs, are also linked to the general regional 
situation, both with regard to the peace process and a 
prospective peace agreement. Lebanon has repeatedly declared 
that it will not sign a peace agreement except in concert with 
the other Arab brothers and after all Arab rights have been 
secured. Additionally, there are actual conditions in the field 
that are connected to the regional situation. Doubtlessly, the 
broad outlines agreed upon yesterday will have a positive effect 
on these conditions and give fresh impetus to the negotiations. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what impressions did you get 
while following the U.S.-Syrian summit yesterday? 
  [Buwayz] Of course, it was a summit meeting between the 
President of the United States whose decisions, following the 
dissolution of the Eastern Bloc, are significant on the 
international level, and President al-Asad, who holds several 
cards enabling him to negotiate from a position of power. The 
dialogue, therefore, took place between two strong figures who 
were able to make decisions and commitments. This is a very 
important point. I also feel that the dialogue was between two 
people fully conversant with the complexity of the Middle East 
crisis and its secondary problems and able to handle them. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what do you think about the 
Israeli condition to halt resistance operations before a 
solution is reached? 
  [Buwayz] We have repeatedly said that the resistance in the 
south is a consequence of the occupation and can never end until 
the occupation is terminated.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has said that the 
Geneva summit has established the basis for an understanding 
that will become evident when the Arab and Israeli negotiators 
meet in Washington. Buwayz said that President al-Asad's use of 
the term "the peace of the brave" is a clear indication of the 
existence of an understanding, at least along broad lines. He 
added: Whoever thought that this summit would be an adventure 
was wrong. 
  Former Prime Minister Dr. Salim al-Huss maintained that the 
Syrian-U.S. summit has given an important push to the peace 
process in the area. He said: President al-Asad, as usual, 
stuck to his guns regarding the correlation of the Syrian, 
Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks, and he emphasized the need to 
abide by UN Resolution 425, which concerns Lebanon. In doing 
so, he was speaking as an Arab president who is aware of his 
pan-Arab responsibilities. He was great in clearly expressing 
commitment to a just and comprehensive peace to safeguard the 
Arabs' interests and rights.

  [Text] Beirut, 17 Jan (MENA)--Lebanese Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz has ruled out the possibility of holding a meeting 
of the cordon countries--Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and the 
PLO--ahead of the coming round of peace talks in Washington. 
Buwayz told MENA that no arrangements have been made for such a 
meeting because time is short. The Lebanese minister said that 
Arab delegations to the peace talks will begin heading for 
Washington in the coming few days to prepare for another round 
of talks. 
  Buwayz said that the Washington talks will be decisive and 
important in light of the al-Asad-Clinton summit, where the two 
presidents agreed to resume these talks immediately in order to 
draw up a declarations of principles, particularly on the Syrian 
and Lebanese tracks. Minister Buwayz predicted that the coming 
talks in Washington will lead to positive results in light of 
the positive atmosphere created by the al-Asad-Clinton summit. 
  Buwayz pointed out that the Arab negotiating delegations 
will 
meet in Washington for consultations and to coordinate their 
positions during the talks.

tonight: We have followed with great satisfaction the positions 
expressed by President Hafiz al-Asad after his talks with U.S.

peace for which we all hope.

formed 
a basic part of the talks, in which President al-Asad adopted 
serious and honorable positions that are certainly appreciated 
by the Lebanese people and Government. He added: In my name, 
and on behalf of the Lebanese Government, I salute President 
al-Asad, who made UN Resolution 425 a main topic on the agenda 
of the historic summit.

  [Text] Commenting on the results of the Geneva summit, 
Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has noted new trends that are 
becoming manifest in the Middle East. The first of these is a 
change in U.S. policy and its dealings with the Arabs, 
particularly with the Syrian president, who has proved his 
ability to negotiate and make great political gains through the 
imposition of a just and honorable settlement. 
  In a statement he made today, Minister Dallul paid tribute 
to 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for promoting the Arab position, 
noting that he did not treat the Golan issue as more important 
than the Lebanese, Jordanian, or Palestinian issues. He said 
that the lesson of the historic summit is summed up as the need 
for steadfastness in pursuing Arab rights and not to follow the 
method of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which is facing new 
obstacles every day. 
  Information Minister Michel Samahah said that the summit 
between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton has moved the Middle East into a new era and laid the 
basis for achieving a just and comprehensive peace. He said: 
What happened yesterday put an end to efforts to achieve a 
separate peace. It also put an end to Israel's efforts to deal 
with each Arab party separately. The summit emphasized the 
comprehensive nature of the solution, the justness of the Arab 
demands, and the need for a just and comprehensive peace based 
on the UN resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242, 323, and 
425, and on the principle of land for peace. 
  Minister Samahah saluted President al-Asad for supporting 
Arab rights, particularly Resolution 425. He said: We must 
give due credit to the one who represented Arab dignity and 
expressed the Arab desire to negotiate on the basis of a firm 
and principled position, thus winning international recognition 
for Arab rights. 
  He said: The Geneva summit is a new turning point. We must 
face the challenge through unity. Minister Samahah was speaking 
at a meeting with Milhim Karam, chairman of the Editors 
Association, and members of the association's council.

  [Text] The results of the historic Geneva summit between 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
are attracting attention on the local, Arab, and international 
levels. These results are the focus of great attention, amid 
positive expectations. Arab and international circles have 
described the results as a basic and important juncture in the 
Middle East peace process. These circles note that President 
al-Asad has gained support for the Arab position by insisting on 
the peace of the brave, implementation of the resolutions of 
international legitimacy, and achieving Israeli withdrawal from 
the south and western al-Biqa'. Positive reactions to the 
results of the Geneva summit are continuing. 
  Deputy Amin al-Hafiz [chairman of parliament's Foreign 
Affairs Committee] said that the results of this summit indicate 
that the time of separate agreements has ended. The attention 
given to the Lebanese situation at the summit talks is very 
important. President Clinton's statement that the United States 
supports the implementation of the al-Ta'if agreement, which 
gives priority to Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon through the 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425, is of 
particular importance. Al- Hafiz affirmed that President 
al-Asad had expressed the Arabs' good intentions, and the ball 
is now in the Israeli court. Al-Hafiz also drew attention to 
the role the Vatican can play in support of Lebanese rights. 
  Deputy Wajih al-Ba'rini maintained that the Syrian-U.S. 
summit represents the start of a new era of peace based on 
justice and equality, the restoration of the rights of oppressed 
peoples led by the Palestinian people, and the implementation of 
the UN resolutions pertaining to countries whose land is under 
occupation, including Lebanon and Syria. Al-Ba'rini added that 
the principled positions adopted by President al-Asad are a 
source of pride for our Arab nation. We hope that the results 
of this summit will benefit the peoples of the area and mark the 
end of conflicts in the Middle East.

  [Excerpts] Phalangist Party Leader Dr. George Sa'adah has 
again warned against allowing political calculations to 
overshadow the ongoing investigations to uncover the identity of 
those who bombed the Phalangist Party headquarters along with 
the masterminds and instigators. He said that we will be lying 
in wait to foil such attempts. At an expanded meeting of the 
Phalangist Party Political Bureau and Central Council members at 
the headquarters in al-Sayfi at 1700 today, he said: Frankly 
speaking, we can see no difficulty in uncovering the details of 
the crime. In fact, we are sure that we will uncover them. The 
possible perpetrators are limited because the parties who are 
capable of preparing such operations are few, and those with 
places where bombs are prepared and those who have interest in 
this crime are all well known. There is evidence. The security 
agencies are active and sincere and our judges are competent, 
and it is not difficult for them to solve such an easy case. 
  Sa'adah said: What we fear are decisions dictated by 
political calculations. There is justification for our fear 
because there are attempts to acquit certain parties through 
tacit political decisions. We will be lying in wait for such 
decisions because this case exceeds our personal safety and 
involves political freedoms and the homeland's security and 
destiny. [passage omitted] 
  On the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva yesterday, Dr. Sa'adah 
emphasized its importance at this stage in particular. He said 
that it was a successful and important summit, noting that the 
Lebanese issue was discussed during the summit. All we hope, he 
said, is that the Lebanese Government will follow up on the 
results with sound diplomatic and political moves and benefit 
from its positive aspects.

  [Text] 'Allamah Sayyid Husayn Fadlallah has said that 
President Hafiz al-Asad has a clear strategy and is not one of 
those who take their cue from the U.S. President. Fadlallah 
said Clinton is doing 90 percent of Israel's bidding in the 
region; the United States has no Middle East policy, but merely 
follows Israel's. So, we do not believe Clinton would do much 
for the oppressed Arabs and Palestinians.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] A PLO leader has described the results of 
al-Asad-Clinton summit as positive. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member 
of the PLO Executive Committee, said that the renewed U.S. 
commitment to achieving a comprehensive and just solution will 
help the entire peace process. In a statement to our radio, 
'Abd-Rabbuh expressed the PLO's leadership appreciation for the 
stand reiterated by President Hafiz al-Asad in his talks in 
Geneva yesterday with regard to linking normalization with 
Israel with a comprehensive solution on all fronts. 
  The Palestinian official expected the talks between Syria 
and 
Lebanon on one hand and Israeli on the other to enter a serious 
phase. He expressed hope that these talks will witness real 
progress. He said that, at the same time, he believes that the 
difficulties facing all parties call for reactivating the 
comprehensive coordination among all Arab countries or among the 
five cordon states. 
  Thus, in the absence of an official PLO stance, Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Information Department, who was 
optimistic on the eve of the Geneva summit today believes that 
the results of this summit were not disappointing.

<F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>
  [Text] Kabul, Jan 18 (AFP) -- Warring factions opposing and 
supporting President Borhanoddin Rabbani exchanged scores of 
long-range rockets and mortars in an artillery duel in eastern 
Kabul on Tuesday [18 Jan]. 
  Despite the promise of a lull in hostilities due to a 
blanket 
of snow that descended on Kabul in the night, the artillery 
firefight continued for 90 minutes, followed by the deadly 
rattle of small-arms fire. 
  Pro-Rabbani troops are now in their 18th consecutive day of 
fighting against the rival Uzbek forces of ex-communist General 
Abdol Rashid Dostam, and his military partner Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar. 
  Rabbani's spokesman told AFP that the president had rejected 
his rival's demand for his resignation as a precondition to the 
cessation of the fighting. 
  "The president has already triumphed," said spokesman Abdol 
Aziz Morad, as windows in his house rattled from the shock-waves 
of incoming artillery bursts. 
  He said the coup attempt by the "Dostam militia" had failed, 
and that except for the two eastern bases of Bala Hissar and 
Maranjan Hill, Dostam forces had lost most of their strongholds 
in Kabul. 
  Morad stressed there would be no ceasefire with the Dostam 
forces. 
  "The concept of a ceasefire has no reality. A sacred war, 
Jihad, has been declared," he stated. 
  Morad reiterated Radio Kabul's message that the April 1992 
general amnesty issued for Dostam's ex-communist forces had been 
suspended. 
  Morad said that captured Dostam forces would face trial in 
accordance with the Shariat, or Muslim religious law. 
  Dostam himself, Morad said, is a "killer and a criminal, who 
did nothing for the past 15 years except assassinate the Afghan 
people". 
  Although he blamed Dostam, former Afghan communist president 
Babrak Karmal, and Hekmatyar equally for the coup attempt, no 
Jihad has been formally declared against the prime minister's 
Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] faction. 
  "But if Hezb stand with the Dostam militia, they will be 
killed in the same way as the militia will be killed," Morad 
said. 
  He said there were many honest mojahedin among the Hezb-e 
Eslami ranks, and that the "state" was trying to woo them over 
to its side. 
  "We are trying to split the honest Hezb from their 
leadership," said Morad. "It would be better if all the Hezb 
split from Hekmatyar." 
  Rabbani's camp does not recognise Hekmatyar as the country's 
legal prime minister. "Hekmatyar has forfeited his honour, his 
prestige, and the achievments of his political past," Morad said. 
  In Pakistan, the Hezb-e Eslami said Rabbani had lost 
legitimacy. A Hezb statement urged all countries not to deal 
with his government, saying that it did not represent the will 
of the Afghan people.

  [Text] The head of the Syrian regime, Hafiz al-Asad, 
returned to Damascus last night following the talks he held in 
Geneva with U.S. President Bill Clinton on the settlement of the 
Palestine question and bilateral relations. 
  In another development, U.S. President Bill Clinton last 
night said that he discussed with the head of the Syrian regime 
the possibility of dispatching U.S. troops to the Golan Heights 
in a peace-keeping mission, as he claimed. 
  In statements to journalists on board the presidential plane 
that took him back to Washington following a meeting with Hafiz 
al-Asad in Geneva, Clinton said that al-Asad stressed the need 
for mutual assurances in the peace process, and that the Syrian 
president has clearly committed himself, during the talks, to 
establishing amity with the Zionist entity. 
  A Zionist source said that Dennis Ross, coordinator of the 
peace process, last night briefed Zionist Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin on the two presidents' talks in Geneva. The U.S. 
President also held a telephone conversation with the Zionist 
prime minister to brief him on the results of his meeting with 
the head of the Syrian regime. Clinton has also held a telephone 
conversation with the head of the Egyptian regime, Husni 
Mubarak, and agreed with him to continue consultations on the 
settlement process.

  [Text] A press statement has been released on the meeting 
held yesterday at the headquarters of the General Secretariat of 
the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] between the GCC and the 
United States. The GCC side was chaired by Sulayman al-Sulayyim, 
Saudi minister of commerce and current chairman of the GCC 
Committee for Trade Cooperation. The U.S. side was chaired by 
His Excellency Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown. According to 
the press statement, the meeting was attended by 'Abdullah 
al-Quwayz, the GCC assistant secretary general for economic 
affairs, Ambassador Ma'mun Kurdi, the general coordinator of 
economic negotiations in the GCC, a number of officials 
representing specialized sectors in the GCC member states, and 
U.S. officials. 
  The statement welcomed the continuation of the economic 
dialogue between the GCC member states and the United States, 
and stated that this dialogue helped strengthen economic 
cooperation between the two sides in line with the strategic 
political ties existing between them. The statement also 
stressed the need to expand and diversify economic relations and 
improve the movement of goods between markets on both sides. 
The statement pointed out that the two sides had agreed to 
cooperate in the field of specifications and standards and to 
remove trade barriers. 
  The statement referred to wider participation and a 
contribution in the development of investment opportunities, as 
reviewed by the conference of businessmen from GCC member states 
and the United States held in Washington 20-21 April 1992. The 
statement added that this conference was a good opportunity for 
both sides to exchange information on the perspectives of 
investment, particularly with regard to the new companies in the 
markets. The statement supported the idea of holding similar 
conferences once every two years and it welcomed Bahrain's offer 
to host the next conference in 1995. 
  The statement further said that the two sides had agreed to 
set up two working groups, one to look into the possibilities of 
practical and technical cooperation and the other to examine and 
discuss the opportunities and the obligations resulting from the 
GATT system and the Uruguay agreements, facilitate the entry of 
the GCC member states to the GATT agreement, and find the 
necessary means to expand the perspectives of trade between the 
GCC member states and the United States. 
  The two sides also agreed to start negotiations with a view 
to drafting a memorandum of understanding in the field of 
specifications. The statement added that the two sides agreed 
on the need and importance of setting up a free and open world 
trade system.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz in </F>
his office in Beirut by unidentified Lebanese Broadcasting 
Corporation correspondent in Geneva; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Buwayz] I believe that whoever expects this 
[U.S.-Syrian] summit to be preplanned is wrong. Whoever 
believes that this summit is an uncalculated adventure that was 
not prepared for is equally wrong. I think that this summit 
will involve basic principles and main courses that will be 
agreed upon. It will also involve certain limits to be 
negotiated. 
  [Correspondent] In your view, what are the main topics that 
will be discussed? 
  [Buwayz] I believe that this summit will discuss different 
topics, including the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and 
ways to guarantee Israel's withdrawal from this region, the 
peace process, Gaza-Jericho, and regional stability -- or rather 
the strategic vision of the future situation in the region. 
  [Correspondent] Do you believe that the U.S. side has 
shifted 
from its role as an impartial mediator to that of the full 
partner, as al-Asad wants, and that it is trying to convey a 
specific Israeli proposal to Syria to move negotiations ahead? 
  [Buwyaz] This summit undoubtedly comes after an obstruction 
to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as well as a stalemate on the 
Jordanian- Israeli and Syrian- and Lebanese-Israeli tracks. I 
believe that the United States is fully aware of the need to 
abandon the theory of seeking independent, unilateral agreements 
and to work toward a comprehensive peace involving all. 
  Judging by that principle, which governs the Geneva meeting, 
I think that the United States has a new dynamism and that a new 
daring approach might characterize the U.S. role in this summit, 
and maybe after it. This new approach is based on a U.S. belief 
that the stalemate that characterized negotiations for more than 
two years must be handled by a different approach. 
  [Correspondent] President Ilyas al-Hirawi yesterday said 
that 
President al-Asad is negotiating on behalf of all Arabs, 
particularly Lebanon, and that he will not relinquish Arab 
rights. However, U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Mark Hambley said a 
few days ago that Lebanon might not be a separate topic on the 
summit agenda. Can you comment? 
  [Buwayz] In fact, these two views do not conflict. I believe 
that President al-Asad this time and at this particular moment 
embodies a basic regional power that has influence at the 
Palestinian level and accordingly influences what happens in 
Gaza and Jericho, on a moral level in Jordan and in Lebanon, in 
addition to the Syrian level, of course. 
  Accordingly, President al-Asad is, of course, a regional 
negotiator in this summit, because what he will talk about will 
go beyond the occupied Syrian Golan. Moreover, President 
Clinton represents an international power. After the collapse 
of the Soviet Union and the eastern bloc, the United States has 
become the sole superpower, holding many political, economic, 
and technological cards. 
  Hence, I believe that the Lebanese issue--that is Lebanon's 
rights--might not be discussed in this summit. The issue is not 
under discussion. The issue is very clear: Either there is a 
real and comprehensive peace and Israel will accordingly 
undertake to withdraw fully from south Lebanon to the 
internationally-recognized borders [sentence as heard]. 
However, the Israeli occupation involves some points related to 
the regional situation. So long as there are regional 
solutions, solutions to these points could also be found.

lift the sweeping embargo imposed on Baghdad following its 
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait." The report adds that Tariq 
'Aziz arrived in Amman "to relay Baghdad's request."]

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] In Geneva, Clinton will seek to persuade President 
Hafiz al-Asad to enlarge Syria's participation in the Middle 
East peace process. Room for U.S. maneuver in this regard is 
limited in view of Washington's knowledge of the nature of 
previous Syrian stances. These called for total and 
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights before 
taking one step on the path of normalizing relations with the 
Zionist enemy. 
  There is not the least doubt that Syria holds winning 
political cards. Although Clinton is likely to give President 
al-Asad other privileges, setting forth numerous options, 
Damascus will not discard its winning cards in the hope of 
obtaining such privileges, because Syria knows that developments 
in the region cannot be predicted or relied upon. Discarding 
its winning cards under such circumstances is not in line with 
Syria's national interests. Hizballah in Lebanon is now stronger 
than before. Every plot hatched by the Zionists and agents to 
remove it from the political arena and from the battlefield have 
failed, because Hizballah is now part of political life; its 
representatives have won seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The 
Damascus-based 10 Palestinian factions opposed to the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement continue their activities. 
  Official Zionists circles themselves have stressed that the 
Zionist forces will not completely withdraw from the Golan 
Heights even if stability were to return to the region and even 
if ties were to be established between Damascus and Tel Aviv. 
Even when we consider all these factors, it cannot be ruled out 
that the Geneva summit may reach important and fateful results 
as did the Bush-al-Asad summit. Anyway, the final say regarding 
Jerusalem and Palestine will be determined by the Islamic 
peoples in the region, primarily the Palestinians.

  [Text] The prime minister's bureau says that at this point 
Israel sees no sense in reacting to the remarks made at the news 
conference by Presidents Clinton and al-Asad, because a U.S. 
team is due in Israel, perhaps tonight, to report on the 
meeting. The bureau notes that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
thanks President Clinton for his contribution to the promotion 
of the peace process. 
  Minister Shulamit Aloni says a summit meeting should be 
planned soon between the Syrian president and Prime Minister 
Rabin. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid is encouraged by the results of the 
meeting in Geneva, and says that Clinton's remarks about 
al-Asad's willingness to establish normal relations with Israel 
are very important and commit the Syrian president. 
  Tzomet says that Prime Minister Rabin has scored a failure 
in 
the management of the peace process, and has now given President 
Clinton the power to make decisions. 
  Demonstrations against the Geneva summit have begun in 
various locations in the north. Residents of kibbutzim in the 
Bet She'an Valley are holding a demonstration at the 'En Hanaziv 
junction under the slogan: Clinton and al-Asad Will Not 
Determine the Future of the Golan. Another demonstration was 
held at the Tzemah junction, and some 200 people are 
demonstrating in Qiryat Shemona. Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv 
reports that the Israel Police have reinforced their deployment 
in anticipation of the reaction of the inhabitants of the north.

<F P=106> [Report by radio correspondents "in the besieged and </F>
steadfast West Bank and Gaza"] 
  [Text] Our Palestinian people's confidence in Damascus has 
never shaken and they have never been affected by the 
psychological warfare launched by Zionists and their forces to 
propagate their dreams about the results of the Geneva meeting 
between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. 
  The stands were clear: Al-Asad, who called for the peace of 
the brave, was not and will never be like 'Arafat who distorted 
this slogan and turned it into a capitulatory slogan for the 
defeatists. Al-Asad, who was the first to raise this slogan, 
wants it to be clear and frank. He wants peace to be based on 
achieving justice and restoring rights. The U.S. officials, who 
dreamed of achieving something from this meeting in the interest 
of the Zionist entity, did not hide this fact when they conveyed 
Clinton's impressions about President al-Asad's steady and firm 
stand on issues considered by Damascus to be among its top 
priorities and commitments. At the top of these commitments is 
the fact that the Palestinian vanguards, which found shelter, 
sympathy, and care in Syria are militant and liberation 
vanguards that seek to achieve their Palestinian people's 
freedom and to see dawn on their usurped lands. 
  Thus, Arab Damascus refutes American and Zionist allegations 
that the Palestinian liberation factions are terrorist 
organizations that undermine peace. Clinton said at his news 
conference that differences with Syria lie in different fields, 
including the presence of certain groups, such as the Jibril 
group [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command], as he said in his statement. This reaffirms our 
Palestinian people's confidence in al-Asad's Syria, which forced 
Clinton to publicly annul the label of terrorists with which the 
vanguards of our people were described and to acknowledge the 
firmness of the Syrian stand. 
  Therefore, the expectations of some observers have been 
reiterated; namely, the clear and firm Syrian stand will not be 
changed by all that has been connoted by Zionism and all that it 
has planted in the mind of the U.S. Administration in order to 
keep the United States a tool in its hand. 
  The al-Asad-Clinton summit very ably disproved the picture 
drawn before the U.S. President by the stands of capitulation 
and shame adopted by some defeatists and surrenderers who, 
falsely, claim the representation of our heroic people. Those 
defeatists and surrenderers panted in Washington just to put 
their hands in the hand of terrorist Rabin and to sign the 
accord of treason with him at the expense of their people's 
objectives and aspirations. 
  Greetings of appreciation and pride from our Palestinian 
people to the stand of brotherhood, fraternity, struggle, and 
determination to achieve justice advocated by al-Asad's Syria 
from the beginning of our people's cause when 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam led our people's strugglers, until he was martyred in 
Ya'bad's jungles, and when Sa'id al-'As carried out his heroic 
acts, until the full liberation is achieved, God willing.

  [Text] In cooperation with Egypt and Jordan, the PLO has 
embarked on a process of counting Palestinian refugees who left 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip after the 1967 war as a result of 
Israel's occupation. The Palestinian news agency, WAFA, 
explains that this count constitutes the first step toward 
ensuring the return of those refugees. WAFA says that the PLO 
offices and the Egyptian embassies abroad have begun to count 
refugees from the occupied Gaza Strip. Newspapers will publish 
announcements in this regard. The agency adds that the PLO and 
Jordan will soon begin a similar process in Jordan to count the 
refugees from the occupied West Bank.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Jan (MENA)--The final touches are 
currently being put to the provisional Palestinian constitution 
that will be enacted during the transitional period as soon as 
power is transferred to the Palestinians in accordance with the 
Declaration of Principles signed in Washington in September. 
Jamal al-Surani, PLO Executive Committee member and supervisor 
of the Constitution Drafting Committee, stated that the most 
important features of the new constitution is that the system of 
government in the Palestinian state is republican and democratic 
and it emphasizes the freedoms of individuals and that the 
establishments, not individuals, rule. 
  In a statement to MENA, al-Surani said that the new 
constitution emphasizes the necessity for complete separation of 
powers and for granting individuals full freedoms, ruling out 
exceptional laws and nonroutine judiciary. He said that the 
Palestinian constitution also stresses the need to elect a real 
parliament to govern and to represent the people. It provides 
for the election of a head of state for a limited period and 
through free and direct elections. 
  Al-Surani pointed out that the committee enacting the 
provisional Palestinian constitution, which comprises seven 
senior Palestinian lawmakers, began its work four months ago, 
noting that the committee sought guidance from numerous 
constitutions around the world. He noted that the provisional 
constitution consists of 50 articles. He said that the 
permanent constitution of the Palestinian state will be enacted 
by the Palestinian people themselves on their land. He noted 
that the new constitution emphasizes individual ownership, a 
market economy, and the gradual provision of social and medical 
guarantees to the Palestinian people. He noted that it is not 
easy for a nascent entity to provide for all its people's needs. 
The constitution, he said, also emphasizes the principles of 
political plurality and the establishment of diverse political 
parties to compete in legislative elections. 
  Al-Surani said that the number of representatives in the 
Palestinian parliament, according to the constitution, will be 
in proportion to the population, noting that a system for the 
election of the legislative council is being prepared to 
determine the conditions that parliament members should meet. 
He noted that the formation of the Palestinian government will 
be the responsibility of the political party that wins the 
largest number of Parliamentary seats. If no party wins a 
majority of votes, a coalition will be set up from several 
political parties. He pointed out that the Palestinian council 
of ministers will be responsible to parliament and not to the 
president of the republic and that the council's responsibility 
will be collective and not individual.

  [Text] Brother Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], director of 
the PLO's Economic Department, has said that the PLO has decided 
to open a Palestinian development bank to channel foreign aid to 
the occupied territories. 
  In remarks to REUTERS, he said the bank will start off with 
$250 million, partly contributed by the Palestinian authority 
and Palestinian and foreign private sectors, including (?French) 
banks. 
  Brother Abu-al-'Ala' said the establishment of the bank 
marks 
a key step, which, besides facilitating the flow of assistance 
to the occupied land, will be the conduit for loans to the 
private sector. 
  International aid donors met in Paris last month and pledged 
$570 million in 1994 toward funding Palestinian projects in the 
areas due to come under the interim Palestinian self-rule 
authority. 
  The decision to set up a Palestinian development bank was 
made by the accountants of the Palestinian Economic Council for 
Development and Reconstruction when it convened last week. The 
PLO Executive Committee will meet in a few days to name a 
constituent body for the bank, which is expected to begin its 
operations within months.

  [Excerpt] The National Council of the Rally for Culture and 
Democracy [RCD] has been meeting since this morning at the Safir 
Hotel in Algiers to decide on the issue of participation in the 
national conference. Mourad Madaoui who is following the 
proceedings sent us this report: 
  [Madaoui] During his intervention, RCD Secretary General Dr. 
Said Saadi assessed the situation in the country and said that 
it has not changed for two years. Moreover, Saadi said: We 
have returned to the period of President Bendjedid's 
resignation. This is what Saadi says and infers from the 
stances of the sides steering the dialogue. He wondered about 
the way the RCD could participate and about the form of its 
abstention, if the council prefers not to take part. 
  As usual, Said Saadi was aggressive in his intervention and 
strongly criticized the National Dialogue Commission's [NDC] 
method of work, affirming that it did not take into account the 
proposals put forward by some parties despite the successive 
meetings. The RCD secretary general added that the NDC's role 
has changed as it is now only directing the dialogue, thus 
overlooking the political role entrusted to it. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The National Liberation Front [FLN]: Will it 
participate or not in the dialogue conference? This issue has 
been entrusted to the politburo. However the FLN has been 
reaffirming that it will not participate in approving a meeting 
that excludes any effective political force. The resolution 
endorsed by the FLN central committee called on the politburo 
which it authorized to take the initiatives it deems necessary 
for the national dialogue and to avoid solutions that do not 
lead to national unanimity. 
  [Begin FLN Secretary General Abdelhamid Mehri recording] The 
central committee, out of its desire to avoid useless solutions, 
asks the politburo not to endorse any authority, and not to 
employ the credit of the party in providing imaginary legitimacy 
to such an authority, but it remains prepared to cooperate with 
any authority which genuinely desires to take the country out of 
the crisis and restore it to legitimacy and its natural 
situation. The central committee, out of its concern for the 
position of the National People's Army and its desire to 
preserve its position on account of it being a constitutional 
establishment, expects from it in these serious circumstances to 
support any orientation for a comprehensive dialogue which 
responds to the people's expectation to take the country out of 
the crisis and restore it to a natural situation. The central 
committee is of the opinion that the proposed national 
conference is not the only formula for making the national 
dialogue successful. It reaffirms once again the FLN's 
attachment to the serious comprehensive and far-reaching 
dialogue to take the country out of the crisis. [end recording] 
  Immediately following the end of the session Mr. Abdelhamid 
Mehri met with the national and foreign press and answered some 
of the questions relating to issues of national dialogue. The 
participation in the national conference remains linked to the 
extent of the development of the stances of the sides involved 
in the national dialogue. 
  For its part, the Rally for Culture and Democracy [RCD] held 
a session of its national council to study the general situation 
in the country and its attitude toward the dialogue and the 
participation in the national conference. At the beginning of 
the session and following a comprehensive analysis of the 
situation in Algeria at the political, economic, and security 
levels, RCD leader Said Saadi dealt with the issue of the 
dialogue. Will the RCD participate in the national conference 
or not? To answer this question, Said Saadi said that it was 
inevitable that several points should be discussed, and in the 
light of this the executive council of the party will decide 
whether to participate in the dialogue. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali Sunday 
[16 January] met with Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz 
for talks on Jordanian-Iraqi relations, officials said. 
  Diplomatic sources said Mr. 'Aziz, who arrived here 
Saturday, 
was seeking Jordanian intervention with Washington to end the 
international sanctions imposed against his country following 
its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
  No official comment was available on the al-Majali-'Aziz 
talks, which were attended by other ministers. Officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said the meeting covered a broad 
review of Jordanian-Iraqi relations. 
  But according to the diplomatic sources, Mr. 'Aziz wanted to 
request Jordan to raise the issue of the sanctions during the 
Jan. 21 meeting at the White House between His Majesty King 
Husayn and President Bill Clinton. 
  "Iraq has met all the requirements of the U.N. resolutions" 
related to the Gulf war ceasefire in March and April 1991, and, 
"as such, Iraq believes that the sanctions should be removed as 
soon as possible," said a diplomatic sources. 
  "It is a straight-forward move and Mr. 'Aziz's talks in 
Amman 
come in the context of the international efforts exerted by Iraq 
to end the sanctions," added the source. There was no immediate 
word on how Jordan was responding to the Iraqi request. 
  Dr. al-Majali and Royal Court Chief Sharif Zayd Bin Shakir 
as 
well as several other members of the Cabinet are expected to 
leave for Washington Tuesday to join King Husayn in his meeting 
with President Clinton. 
  Jordan has repeatedly invited international attention to the 
suffering of the Iraqi people, particularly children and the 
elderly, who are net victims of the sanctions, which have 
deprived the country of external revenues to pay for its 
people's needs. 
  The U.N. Security Council is expected to hold a periodic 
review of the sanctions on Tuesday, but it is not expected to 
lift the embargo for at least another six months--a period that 
U.N. sanctions enforcement officials say is needed to ensure 
that long-term monitoring of Iraqi weapon development programme 
is in place. 
  Mr. 'Aziz was originally scheduled to be in New York for 
consultations with Security Council members this week, but the 
plans appeared to have been called off. 
  Instead, Iraq is focusing on facilitating the mission of 
U.N. 
weapon experts' mission in its soil with a view to securing a 
clean certificate in February or early March to be presented to 
the Security Council with a request that the sanctions be lifted 
at the next round of the review of the embargo. 
  Mr. 'Aziz's talks with Dr. al-Majali followed the renewal of 
an agreement under which Iraq supplies Jordan's oil needs. The 
Iraqi News Agency (INA) said Saturday that the agreement, signed 
by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Walid 'Asfur and 
Iraqi Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad, covered a broad range of 
cooperation in the oil industry. No Jordanian confirmation of 
the INA report was available. 
<H5>  Grid-link talks </H5>
  Dr. 'Asfur, who began a visit to Baghdad last week, is also 
attending a meeting with the energy ministers of Iraq, Egypt and 
Turkey on cooperation in electricity generation and supply. 
  The meeting, which began in the Iraqi capital on Saturday, 
is 
expected to produce technical agreements that will pave the way 
for linking the power grids of the four countries at a cost of 
$450 million. 
  The meeting is expected to produce technical agreements that 
will enable the four countries working in earnest on a $450 
million project. [sentence as published] 
  The five countries signed cooperation protocols in Amman 
last 
year to push ahead with the project, which will not violate U.N. 
sanctions as it is not expected to be implemented in Iraq until 
the end of the decade. 
  Zaki 'Awdah, Syria's electricity chief, said funding was not 
a problem as Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social 
Development and the Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank had 
pledged to finance the project. 
  Hasan Mahmud Sa'id, Egypt's electricity under-secretary, 
said 
energy ministers of the five countries planned to meet in Egypt 
in April to put the last touches to the mutual agreements. 
  He said Egypt and Jordan were already working on linking up 
their two countries' power networks. He said he hoped the 
agreements would be fully implemented by 1997. 
  The project's economic viability is based on an estimated $2 
to $3 billion savings in annual electricity generation costs 
after its expected inauguration in 1998.

<F P=106> [By unidentified JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Iraq has agreed to continue supplying oil to 
Jordan under an exemption granted by the U.N. Security Council 
during talks in Baghdad last week between Jordan's energy and 
natural resources minister and Iraqi officials, informed sources 
said. 
  They said Minister Walid 'Asfur held a series of talks 
starting with Iraqi Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad and other 
ministers as well as Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khuddayir. 
  Dr. 'Asfur also met with presidential adviser Ja'far Dhiya' 
Ja'far, reports from Baghdad said. 
  "During the talks, Iraq agreed to renew the annual agreement 
on oil supplies to Jordan and the accord could be formalised 
soon," said one source. No details of the agreement were 
immediately available; nor was it known whether it differed much 
from the 1993 accord. 
  Under a tacit exemption granted by the U.N. Security 
Council, 
which imposed a sweeping international embargo against Iraq 
following Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Iraq is 
allowed to export oil to Jordan. 
  Jordan gets an average of 50,000 barrels of crude oil and 
20,000 barrels of fuel oil from Iraq trucked overland daily to 
the Kingdom's refinery in al-Zarqa'. 
  No cash is changing hands in the deal since the oil is 
supplied partly free and partly in settlement of Iraqi debts to 
Jordan. 
  The sources said the main purpose of Mr. 'Asfur's visit to 
Baghdad, where he arrived Wednesday, was to renew the oil 
agreeent and that he also held general discussions on 
Jordanian-Iraqi ties and prospects of cooperation after the 
expected lifting of sanctions. 
  "The (Iraqi) government is highly hopeful that the sanctions 
could be lifted before April, although U.N. officials have said 
that it could not be done before June," said a diplomatic source. 
  According to the source, the Iraqi government, which 
accepted 
long-term monitoring of its weapons programme late last year 
after a protracted stand-off with the U.N., was focusing on the 
work of U.N. inspectors in Iraq with a view to getting a clean 
certificate from them before March. 
  "Iraqi officials have been holding extensive discussions 
with 
representatives of major international oil companies on 
post-sanctions cooperation," said a highly-informed diplomat. 
"These included American as well European, particularly French 
and Italian firms." 
  Also expected to be raised during Dr. 'Asfur's visit to 
Baghdad was Jordanian concern over the impact of the reopening 
of Iraq's Umm Qasr Port on the flow of Iraq-bound cargo through 
al-'Aqabah. 
  In talks in Amman in late November, Iraqi officials assured 
Jordan that the flow of Iraqi imports, which has dwindled to 20 
per cent of pre-crisis levels, would continue and that Umm Qasr, 
Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf, would be used to accommodate 
small freighters with cargo from the far east. 
  The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday to 
decide 
whether to maintain the international embargo against Iraq. 
  The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported late Saturday that 
Jordan and Iraq signed an agreement in which they agreed to 
cooperate in 'all key oil industries, including excavating and 
digging." 
  The agreement covers bilateral cooperation in all the 
sectors 
of the oil industry, including drilling and exploration, along 
with Iraqi technical assistance for the Jordanian oil industry 
and training for Jordanian oil workers, INA said.

<F P=106> [By unidentifed JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--His Majesty King Husayn is scheduled to meet 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Jan. 21 for talks on issues 
ranging from the Middle East peace process to American-Jordanian 
relations, officials here and in Washington said. 
  The King, who left for London last week for a short stay in 
Britain, is expected to head for Rochester, Minnesota, soon for 
medical checkups at the Mayo Clinic. Following the check-up, the 
King will spend a few days in the state of Colorado on a private 
visit before proceeding to Washington to meet Mr. Clinton. 
  Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and several members 
of 
his Cabinet are expected to head for Washington this week to 
join the King in his talks with Mr. Clinton. 
  It will be the second White House meeting between the King 
and Mr. Clinton. The two leaders met first in June. 
  Among the issues that are expected to be discussed between 
the King and President Clinton are the course of the peace 
process, U.S.-Jordan economic cooperation and military ties, 
officials said. 
  The king will brief the president on the progress of 
negotiations between Jordan and Israel, and reiterate that there 
cannot be any signing of a peace agreement separate from an 
overall accord addressing all the four tracks of the 
Arab-Israeli negotiations launched in Madrid in October 1991. 
  All indications are that Sunday's summit in Geneva between 
President Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad could 
produce a major breakthrough to lift the logjam in the 
Syrian-Israeli track of negotiations, and, by extension, advance 
the Lebanese-Israeli peace talks. 
  As such, analysts say, the King's meeting with President 
Clinton comes at a crucial stage in the quest for peace in the 
Middle East in that he would have known by then the result of 
the U.S.-Syrian summit by Jan. 21 and could formulate Jordan's 
next steps accordingly. 
  King Husayn was in touch with President al-Asad over the 
phone on Thursday. Reports from Damascus said the two leaders 
exchanged views on the current moves in the peace process and 
means to advance the Arab-Israeli negotiations. In the 
meantime, it was reported from Washington that the next round of 
Arab-Israeli peace talks would begin there on Jan. 24. 
  On the bilateral front, the King and President Clinton are 
expected to review the work of a joint 
Jordanian-American-Israeli economic working group and ideas and 
proposals discussed during the Middle East visit in December of 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  The conclusion of an agreement on reopening Jordanian 
commerical banks in the occupied territories is the only 
concrete result so far of the work of the group. Negotiations 
on the accord had started alsmost one year before the group was 
formed during a visit by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan 
to Washington in October. 
  Proposals for joint projects and American suggestions of 
"confidence-building measures" between Jordan and Israel are 
also expected to be reviewed by King Husayn and President 
Clinton. 
  Prime Minister al-Majali, who delayed his departure for 
Washington for a few days so that he could meet with visiting 
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown on Monday, told reporters 
last week that Jordan hoped "for continuous support of the 
Jordanian economy and defence forces as well as debt reduction." 
  President Clinton has pledged to help Jordan in addressing 
its foreign debts, and diplomats say that one of the measures 
under consideration could be a write-off of part of the 
Kingdom's debts to the U.S. 
  Amman owes Washington $946 million, including $380 million 
in 
military debts incurred during the 1980s, when Jordan depended 
solely on the U.S. to equip its armed forces. In 1987, Jordan 
turned to the then Soviet Union for its needs of a defensive 
missile system after the Reagan administration flatly turned 
down a $1.8 billion arms package for the Kingdom. 
  Jordanian-American military ties have been renewed since 
then. Armed forces of the two sides held at least three joint 
military exercises in the southern desert and the Red Sea after 
the end of the Gulf war over Kuwait in 1991. 
  General Joseph Hoar, head of the U.S. Central Command, was 
in 
Jordan last week on his third visit to the Kingdom after 
assuming office in 1991. 
  His Royal Highness Prince Muhammad, the Regent, and Dr. 
al-Majali, who is also defence minister, held talks with Gen. 
Hoar. Ideas discussed during the meeting are expected to be 
explored during the King's summit with President Clinton. 
  Official and informed sources say that despite President 
Clinton's pledge in October, even the release of up to $35 
million in aid to Jordan has been held up. 
  The administration issued a certification to release the aid 
on Sept. 15, one day after Jordan and Israel signed an agenda 
outlining the basis for negotiations and a peace agreement. 
  Also expected to be raised during the White House meeting 
are 
Jordan's concerns over the de facto blockade of al-'Aqabah as 
part of the enforcement of the international sanctions against 
Iraq and what officials here describe as stalling at the U.N. 
over Jordan's requests for permission for exports of 
sanction-exempt food and medicine to Iraq.

Kingdom bought more than $300 million in American products in 
1993, while exporting less than $5 million.

  [Text] The Jordanian side led by Dr. Rima Khalaf, the 
minister of industry and commerce, and the U.S. side led by Mr. 
Ronald Brown, the U.S. secretary of commerce, held a meeting at 
the Ministry of Industry and Commerce today in the presence of 
Dr. Ziyad Fariz, the minister of planning; Sami Qammuh, the 
minister of finance; and a number of officials in the public and 
private sectors from both countries. The two sides discussed 
bilateral trade relations and means to bolster and develop these 
relations. Details are in the following report: 
  Dr. Khalaf reviewed trade relations between Jordan and the 
United States and the great investment opportunities that the 
citizens are expecting as a result of the peace process in the 
region--a process that achieves a just, comprehensive, and 
durable peace and maintains Arab rights. She talked about 
Jordan's current economic reform program and the positive 
results of this program. She noted that the Gulf war had a 
negative impact on the program, which led to its interruption 
for a period of time. 
  The minister said that Jordan is an important partner to the 
United States, pointing out that Jordan's import of U.S. goods 
is 23 percent of its overall world imports at a time when 
Jordanian exports to the United States are very limited. In 
this regard, the minister expressed Jordan's desire to sign an 
agreement with the United States to take advantage of the 
preferential U.S. trade system, based on which exports to the 
United States, including Jordanian exports, are given privileges 
such as customs exemption. She noted that Jordanian exporters 
faced some difficulties as a result of being excluded from this 
system and its privileges. Dr. Khalaf said that Jordan is 
seeking to improve the investment climate in order to find 
appropriate trade relations with the world, including the United 
States. 
  Minister of Planning Dr. Ziyad Fariz said that Jordan began 
planning policies in the areas of investment and development of 
exports in 1989. He noted that the Ministry is seeking to 
privatize some of the public sector's properties, adding that 
this requires assistance as well as a solution to the social 
problems that could result from this. He said there are 
economic and social reforms in this field such as developing the 
health system. 
  Dr. Fariz also talked about Jordan's efforts to solve the 
problem of Jordan's debts to the International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank. Moreover, the minister of planning presented to 
the U.S. secretary of commerce a paper that summarizes the most 
important economic and social problems and challenges facing 
Jordan. 
  Minister of Finance Sami Qammuh talked about Jordan's debt 
of 
$7.5 million, which obstructs the process of serving commerce 
and investment. He noted that this debt needs to be written off. 
  For his part, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce talked about 
the 
importance of trade exchange between Jordan and the United 
States and the prospects of trade in the region as a result of 
the peace process. He noted the importance of Jordan's 
geographical location, which allows it to play a big role in 
reinforcing trade in the Middle East. He welcomed economic 
reforms in Jordan, which include encouraging the private sector 
and reinforcing its role in investment opportunities. He noted 
the possibility of cooperation between Jordanian and U.S. 
businessmen to encourage the private sectors of both countries 
to get involved in various forms of investment. He welcomed the 
idea of opening a number of branches for Jordanian banks in the 
occupied Arab territories, which will provide for broader 
cooperation between the banking sectors of Jordan and the United 
States. 
  The Jordanian and U.S. sides exchanged ideas on the 
possibilities for commercial cooperation and on encouraging the 
private sector's role in this field. Khaldun Abu-Hassan, head 
of Amman's Chamber of Industry, talked about the embargo imposed 
on Jordanian goods at the port of al-'Aqabah, stressing the need 
to provide the private sectors of both countries with 
opportunities for investment and commercial exchange.

  [Text] Within the framework of enhancing Jordanian-U.S. 
trade relations, His Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, 
received U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown at the Royal 
Hashemite Court today. At the beginning of the meeting, the 
U.S. secretary of commerce handed a message to His Highness 
Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, from U.S. President Bill Clinton 
to His Majesty King Husayn. 
  His highness explained to the American guest Jordan's 
concept 
of world trade and the need to base this trade on human 
requirements rather than on abstract dimensions on the levels of 
Jordanian-U.S. relations and the region as a whole. 
  His highness, the regent, called for defining just and human 
criteria in the world trade system to guarantee the rights of 
states and individuals, particularly in the Middle East. 
  [Begin recording in English] [Brown] Well, we had a very 
frank and cordial discussion. Some creative new ideas about not 
only how to enhance the bilateral relationship between the 
United States and Jordan, but how to engender some real regional 
cooperation, some focus on specific goals, some focus on 
mechanisms for achieving those goals and to really create a 
public-private partnership. So, it is not only bilateral 
relationships or regional relationships between governments, but 
getting the private sector involved as well. It is clear that 
there are many other economic challenges that the region faces 
and many that Jordan faces, and the United States wants to play 
a helpful role in trying to deal directly with those issues. I 
think the peace process moving forward gives us a very real 
opportunity. As we move towards peace, expectations that 
people's lives will change in a real and positive way are 
accelerated, and we have to find ways to meet those 
expectations. I was very pleased with the conversation that we 
had with his royal highness the crown prince, and I believe that 
we will pursue those discussions very actively in the future. 
  [Reporter] Did you discuss the U.S. inspection team in the 
Port of Aqabah? 
  [Brown] I discussed it with some of the ministers of the 
Jordanian Government earlier today. I now am increasingly 
sensitive about the impact that it is having on the Jordanian 
economy, and I intend to pursue those discussions when I get 
back to Washington. There certainly ought to be ways for us to 
be in compliance with the United Nations' resolutions, but in 
ways that do not debilitate the economy of Jordan. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency, Your Royal Highness: Would you 
like to give us a statement about the meeting? 
  [Hasan] Well, I just like to say that when we met with 
President Clinton and Foreign Minister Peres on the White House 
lawn, we said that there is much to be done on the ground, and I 
would like to say that the secretary of commerce's visit to 
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and Egypt is a clear indication of 
the desire to achieve results in terms of understanding trade 
patterns, in terms of encouraging investment, in terms of 
thinking regionally, and it is a very practical series of 
meetings I believe that it had been held here today. And given 
the optimism coming out of the meetings in Geneva and the 
forthcoming meeting between His Majesty King Husayn and 
President Clinton, I think that we are certainly putting a lot 
practical paint on the canvas in terms of our joint 
understanding of what it takes to make peace matter to people on 
the ground here in the region. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan received a 
U.S. economic delegation led by Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown. 
Mr. Brown conveyed to the regent a message from President Bill 
Clinton addressed to his majesty the king. The U.S. secretary 
met other officials for economic talks and the negative economic 
effects of the blockade on the port of al-'Aqabah. He said that 
the removal of trade barriers and the lifting of the Arab 
boycott of Israel would help speed the economic growth in the 
region. 
  At the Royal Court meeting His Royal Highness Crown Prince 
Hasan told the American Secretary of Commerce that international 
trade should not be limited to the sole purpose of trade but 
also take into consideration human needs. The regent said that 
a humanitarian criteria in trade should be introduced to 
guarantee the rights of states and the individual, particularly 
with regard to the Middle East. His royal highness said a lot 
has to be done towards regional economic cooperation. [passage 
omitted] 
  Commenting on calls for lifting the Arab boycott of Israel, 
the regent said: 
  [Begin Hasan recording] This is a question that has to be 
discussed within the context of peace making clearly. But, I 
was very happy during the MEED [Middle East Economic Digest] 
conference in London last week to emphasize the importance of 
the Middle East as free trade area. This is a goal to which we 
all have to work with (?conscience) and a great deal of 
understanding. And I think that this understanding is 
developing as a result of these personal contacts. [end 
recording] 
  Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali also discussed with 
the American official economic ties and the inspection of 
shipping into the port of al-'Aqabah and the need to lift the 
blockade. 
  [Begin Brown recording] I now am increasingly sensitive 
about the impact that it's having on the Jordanian economy and I 
intend to pursue those discussions when I get back to 
Washington. There certainly ought to be ways so as to be in 
compliance with United Nations resolutions but in ways that do 
not debilitate the economy of Jordan. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Trade, Peace, and al-'Aqabah Siege"] </F>
  [Text] During his meeting with the visiting U.S. commerce 
secretary, His Highness Prince Hasan the regent stressed that 
trade, whether on the bilateral level or on the level of the 
region as a whole, must be based on the human needs. This 
requires that the world trade system have fair and humanitarian 
criteria to guarantee the right of both states and individuals. 
  The tour by the U.S. commerce secretary to a number of 
states 
in the region provides evidence of the joint desire to achieve 
the expected results concerning the forms of regional trade, 
especially since this tour coincided with important meetings in 
Geneva and came on the eve of another very important meeting, 
expected to be held in Washington in the next few days between 
His Majesty King Husayn and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  The visit by the U.S. commerce secretary has raised many 
concerns, not only about the future of the regional trade links 
in the age of the desired peace, but also about the current 
situation in Jordan's only seaport. The partial siege imposed 
by the U.S. Navy on al-'Aqabah still stands, making our country 
suffer losses which it cannot put up with forever. 
  The U.S. secretary did well when he showed an understanding 
of the Jordanian viewpoint about the losses resulting from the 
continued sea siege of al-'Aqabah. It is, however, regrettable 
to say that the U.S. commerce secretary is not the first U.S. 
official to show such an understanding and to promise, like the 
visiting secretary has done, to discuss this issue with the 
competent U.S. authorities to ease these unjustified measures, 
which have remained unchanged. 
  In the light of all this, we hope the new promise made by 
the 
U.S. secretary will mark the end of a series of promises which 
do not have any real weight now that the siege on al-'Aqabah has 
been going on for more than three years. During this time the 
Jordanian national economy has suffered additional losses which 
have exacerbated the economic difficulties Jordan has been 
facing since the second Gulf war.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Position That Needs Implementation"] </F>
  [Text] We strongly welcome the U.S.-Russian statement 
emanating from the Clinton-Yeltsin summit in Moscow yesterday. 
The statement emphasized the eagerness of the cosponsors of the 
Middle East peace conference to realize just, comprehensive, and 
lasting peace in the region on the basis of international 
legitimacy resolutions led by Resolutions 242 and 338 and the 
principle of land for peace. 
  The importance of the statement lies in the fact that it was 
made on the eve of the summit between U.S. President Clinton and 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, which will be held in Geneva 
tomorrow. Political circles attach much importance to this 
meeting in paving the way for serious and substantial progress 
in the faltering peace process. Also, the meeting comes in the 
wake of the ongoing problems facing the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations on implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  The statement's emphasis on the principle of just and 
comprehensive peace based on Security Council Resolutions 242 
and 338 clarifies the course of the peace process on all its 
tracks. These tracks are facing Israeli rejection and maneuvers 
regarding a comprehensive solution to the Middle East issue. 
Israel evades commitment to Resolutions 242 and 338, which call 
for its full withdrawal from all occupied territories, including 
Jerusalem, and recognition of the Palestinian people's 
legitimate right to self-determination on their soil. 
  Israel's attempts to evade its commitment to this principle, 
and its positions that conflict with the Declaration of 
Principles it signed with the PLO which calls for full Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, and its attempt to deprive the 
self-rule areas and their crossing points of any vestiges of 
Palestinian sovereignty are the strongest evidence of Israel's 
intentions and rejection of a comprehensive solution and the 
international and legal terms of reference of such a solution, 
as well as its contempt for the cosponsors of the peace 
conference and the peace process as a whole. 
  If we take into consideration Israel's despicable rejection 
of even declaring commitment to withdraw fully from the occupied 
Syrian Golan, its placing of impossible conditions on the 
negotiations on the Syrian track, and its insistence that 
Damascus should define its concept of peace, we will conclude 
that Rabin's government is following a policy of maneuvering and 
deception regarding the achievement of serious progress on the 
Syrian-Israeli track. Israel is also placing similar conditions 
on Lebanon to obstruct implementation of Security Council 
Resolution 425, which calls for immediate withdrawal from 
occupied southern Lebanon. 
  Therefore, the U.S.-Russian statement is a positive prelude 
to the Clinton-al-Asad meeting in Geneva tomorrow, which will 
establish the bases for activating an effective and influential 
U.S. role in forcing Israel to heed the will of the 
international community, UN resolutions, and the principles on 
the basis of which the Madrid peace conference was held, and to 
which the cosponsors were committed, and which they emphasized 
in their latest statement. 
  The Arabs are not prepared to relinquish their land and 
rights after they have offered all they can to render the peace 
process successful. Washington and Moscow should not be 
satisfied with mere statements, and should play their role as 
cosponsors of this process, otherwise, the statement will be no 
more than worthless ink on paper.

  [Text] Their Highnesses Crown Prince Hasan and Princess 
Tharwat returned to Amman this evening after a several-day 
working visit his highness paid to the United Kingdom. During 
the visit, his highness held talks with British Prime Minister 
John Major on the political situation in the region, bilateral 
relations, and the situation in the Balkan states. His Highness 
Crown Prince Hasan also addressed a conference on the economics 
of peace in the Middle East. His highness also took part in a 
meeting held by the Board of Trustees of the Refugees Institute 
at Oxford University. 
  At hand to receive his highness were His Highness Prince 
'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn, His Highness Prince Ghazi Bin-Muhammad, 
a number of their highnesses the princes and princesses, the 
prime minister, the speakers of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives, and top civil and military officials. 
  His highness spoke about his meeting with the British prime 
minister. He said: 
  [Begin recording] [Hasan] We met after British Prime 
Minister 
Major's return from Brussels. He was preoccupied with a basic 
issue; that is, the issue of Yugoslavia. As you know, the U.S. 
initiative was seeking to achieve peace within the European 
framework. It seems there were strong feelings about what 
initiative should be taken in order to contain the ongoing 
tension, especially in Tusla and (Serbrenica), when it came to 
talk about replacing the Canadian and Dutch forces. 
Nevertheless, British Prime Minister Major was concerned about 
the need to clarify this issue to the world. I had the chance 
to stress the need to condemn those who carry out acts of 
violence, whoever they may be and wherever they are, in order to 
enable the UN forces to carry out their tasks and missions. 
  [Reporter] During the conference on the economics of peace 
in 
the Middle East, you stressed that it is necessary for peace to 
reflect on the man in the street. How did intellectuals and 
politicians in Europe react to this call? 
  [Hasan] Just as an investment framework for a regional 
meeting is being pursued, we are also pursuing a human framework 
for meetings that practically define the world community's stand 
toward the human being, the refugee, the evacuee, and the 
expellee. Unless this crystallizes into a world vision, it will 
be hard to talk about a systematic continuation of the peace 
course. Regarding UN institutions, as well as those 
institutions concerned with refugee affairs, I noticed there is 
an inclination to move toward a comprehensive vision. This 
vision applies equally to the World Bank. It is summed in the 
need to establish regional institutions, including a regional 
development bank, that deals, according to internationally 
accepted standards, with all those who seek help and assistance 
at this stage, in order to invest in the human being and make 
him part of the peace course. 
  [Reporter] Sir, you are now the head of the newly re-formed 
Royal Commission for Jerusalem Affairs as delegated by his 
majesty the king. In your opinion, what are the next steps 
toward Jerusalem in response to his majesty's call, in his 
letter to the prime minister, to activate this committee to 
protect Holy Jerusalem? 
  [Hasan] His majesty the king granted me and my colleagues 
this great honor. I hope that we will be able to fulfill the 
duties required of us at this stage within two phases of action. 
The first is a phase that will continue in the future; that is, 
maintaining Jordan's concern with Jerusalem through the Awqaf 
institutions that work on the ground in Jerusalem. When we talk 
about the Royal Commission, we are talking about a unique 
Hashemite Jordanian support for the Arab and Islamic identity. 
We must define this unique role and work toward reaching deep 
understanding of all our responsibilities at this stage. 
  The second role is to acquaint scholars from the Islamic 
world with ethical supremacy, including its dimensions and 
various literature. As for the Arab and Islamic right and duty, 
naturally, there is much room for action within the framework of 
Jerusalem and the holy places in Palestine. I should recall 
that there is dearth of discussion in this field within the 
Islamic and Arab framework. In fact, we need to sharpen the 
conscience and mind. I believe that seeking assistance from an 
elite of scholars in the Islamic world, for which the 
opportunity is open, is a very important and critical issue at 
this particular stage. [end recording] 
  His Highness Crown Prince Hasan this evening took the 
constitutional oath as regent, during his majesty the king's 
presence abroad, before the cabinet and in the presence of 
speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives.

  [Text] Amman (J.T.)--Jordan has been playing an active role 
towards bringing about reconciliation among Arab countries and 
is ready to embark on any step that would contribute to 
achieving that goal, Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali was 
quoted as saying Monday [17 January]. 
  "Jordan is doing all it can to achieve Arab reconciliation 
and is ready to do anything for the sake of the Arab Nation," 
Dr. al-Majali said in an interview published in the United Arab 
Emirate's (UAE) AL-ITTIHAD newspaper. 
  "A reconciliation should cover all types of cooperation, 
including political, economic, cultural and social." 
  His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States, the 
prime minisiter said, aims to give impetus to the peace process 
which is now facing some difficulties. The King is also seeking 
to bolster the Jordanian Armed Forces and will conduct a 
comprehensive review of Jordanian-U.S. relations, he said. 
  In reply to a question, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan 
appreciated 
and supported UAE President Shaykh Zayid Bin Sultan Al Nahayan's 
initiative to restore Arab solidarity. 
  The prime minister described Jordanian-UAR relations as 
brotherly ties and noted that Jordanians working in the UAE have 
always been treated on equal footing with the UAE people. 
  On Jordan's mediation to end the dispute among the leaders 
of 
Yemen, Dr. al-Majali said His Majesty King Husayn had delegated 
Royal Court chief Sharif Zayd Bin Shakir to act as mediator 
carrying royal messages to the Yemeni leaders. 
  "Jordan considers any sucess of any Arab unity as success 
for 
Jordan, which seeks a greater Arab unity," he said. "It is up 
to the Yemeni brothers to resolve their problems amicably and 
Jordan would spare no effort to help them do that." 
  Nothing that is was the Yemeni leaders who had requested the 
King's mediation, Dr. al-Majali said that the unity in Yemen 
concerns the whole Arab world and not Jordan and Yemen alone. 
  Commenting on coordination between Arab states involved in 
the peace process, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan is committed to 
that coordination, and it hopes that the Arab parties will 
succeed in exchanging land for peace in implementation of U.N. 
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. 
  "A just durable peace in Jordan's view entails the return of 
the usurped land and water rights and the end of suffering of 
the people in the region," he said. 
  Commenting on the Oslo accord between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), he said that the deal 
was meant as a declaration of principles and Jordan has no 
alternative but to support the Palestinians in their drive to 
regain their rights. 
  "Any gains achieved by the Palestinians would reflect 
positively on us because we are brothers and together form one 
nation," Dr. al-Majali said. 
  On the future Palestinian-Jordanian relationship, he said 
that the people on the two sides of the River Jordan would have 
to decide on it and determine the nature of union between them 
when the time is right. 
  Dr. al-Majali urged Arab states to join Western creditors in 
rescheduling its debts to revive the economy, rocked by foreign 
debt and a sharp decline in aid. 
  Dr. al-Majali said the domestic economy had started to 
improve since Jordan launched reforms. 
  "We have overcome the most difficult stages and Jordan hopes 
sisterly countries (Arabs) will show understanding as was done 
by friendly countries, which have rescheduled our debts," he 
said. 
  Dr. al-Majali did not name the Arab creditors nor give 
figures. 
  According to official Arab figures, Jordan received around 
$2.1 billion of $19.5 billion extended by Gulf states in loans, 
and grants in the five years before the 1990 Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait. 
  It has also received more than 10 per cent of the total Arab 
aid of nearly $100 billion provided between 1970 and 1992.

Group] 
  [Text] Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton are to meet in Geneva today to discuss the process 
of compromise and the so-called Middle East peace talks. This 
meeting was arranged during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher to Syria two months ago. After the U.S. 
guaranteed that the peace process would continue within the 
framework of the Madrid Conference principles, Syria agreed to 
the al-Asad-Clinton meeting in Geneva and to resume talks with 
the Zionist regime in Washington. 
  America's agreement with the principles of the Madrid 
conference means the acceptance of the joint U.S.-Syrian pattern 
and the rejection of the Israeli pattern. Actually, the joint 
U.S.-Syrian pattern is manifested in the Madrid conference, 
which stipulates two points: peace for land and the 
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The 
Israeli pattern, however, emphasizes bilateral and separate 
talks and secret diplomacy, a good example of which is the 
Gaza-Jericho accord. 
  The Syrians believe that with the non-implementation of the 
accord between 'Arafat and the Zionist regime, the Israeli 
pattern has been somewhat discredited; and the emergence of 
differences between representatives of the PLO and of the 
Zionist regime on the interpretation of each article in the pact 
has laid favorable groundwork for Syria to move the talks once 
again into the framework of the United Nations. 
  Syria has strengthened its position prior to the talks. By 
hosting the conference of the foreign ministers of the six plus 
two countries [six Persian Gulf countries, plus Syria and Egypt] 
in Damascus, Syria mustered their support for its stances; and 
with its important role in Lebanon and in mobilizing those 
Palestinians who oppose the Gaza-Jericho accord, it can claim 
that it is playing a significant regional role in solving the 
Middle East crisis. 
  Political observers believe that even though the United 
States agrees with the Syrian pattern and supports the 
implementation of the Security Council resolutions, nevertheless 
as long as Washington does not want to put pressure on Tel Aviv, 
the current talks in Geneva will yield no results. So far the 
Zionist regime has not agreed to implement Resolution 242 and to 
immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Syria's Golan 
Heights. Thus, political analysts are not optimistic about the 
outcome of the meeting of the Syrian and U.S. heads of state in 
Geneva. But of course, a change in the U.S. stances on Syria at 
the Geneva talks could yield a different result.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Although the meeting between the leaders of America 
and Syria in Geneva yesterday was portrayed as a positive event 
by the two countries, and although it might be considered a 
highlight in relations between Washington and Damascus, neither 
side has spoken of the meeting as an important and fundamental 
development in the efforts for the Middle East deal. 
  The lengthy talks between Clinton and al-Asad -- that were 
held in two sessions, first accompanied by senior political 
delegations of both countries, and then on private and personal 
basis -- were in fact preliminary discussions for bringing 
closer the views of the two countries on issues such as the 
crisis in the Middle East, the plans and efforts for a deal, and 
expansion of bilateral relations. 
  Many political observers believe that no great deal should 
be 
expected from yesterday's meeting between the leaders of 
Washington and Damascus, and without doubt, if they had reached 
unexpected results in the talks -- the prospects of which are 
not strong -- it would not be possible to announce the results 
in the short term, and this would need at least several months. 
  Basically, evaluation of talks held behind closed doors are 
made on the basis of official and open remarks of the 
participants usually made for the press, but these will 
definitely fail to present a full image of the secret 
discussions. 
  In a joint news conference at the end of their meeting, 
Clinton and al-Asad emphasized the need for a brave peace in the 
Middle East region, but also acknowledged the existence of 
differences of views and interpretations. 
  The Syrian president said: We want a true peace that would 
live, guarantee the interests of all sides, and re-acknowledge 
the rights of everyone. 
  Hafiz al-Asad also said the return of the Israeli-occupied 
Golan Heights to Syria was not sufficient for a comprehensive 
peace, and emphasized that according to historic facts, 
individual peace and minor solutions cannot establish true peace 
for the region. 
  In his turn, the American President referred to the key 
Syrian role in establishing a deal in the region. 
  The repeat of the Syrian stance by its president, and 
following his meeting with the American President, indicates 
that not only fundamental hurdles have not been removed on the 
path of a deal in the Middle East crisis, but also the meeting 
has not had an extraordinary achievement for American Middle 
East efforts. 
  The only practical achievement of the meeting-for-a-deal 
between Clinton and al-Asad was the resumption of talks in 
Washington, which itself resembles a thin thread that neither 
America nor Israel wish to break, and which Syria prefers to 
hold on to rather than hold individual talks with Israel. 
  In reality, the main hurdles in the Middle East region exist 
manifestly, and historic experience proves that until the real 
hurdles are not removed peace will not return to the region and 
signing of the so-called peace agreements cannot have a 
fundamental effect. 
  The signing of a peace accord between Egypt and Israel in 
Camp David 16 years ago and the signing of the Gaza-Eriha 
autonomy agreement in Washington four months ago have failed to 
bring the Middle East crisis to an end or to stop the regional 
wars that are related to this crisis. 
  The signing of these agreements have, in fact, led to the 
fall of elements such as Saddat and 'Arafat and their followers 
without allowing American and Israelis to achieve their aims. 
  The signatories of peace agreements with Israel not only 
failed to bring legitimacy for the usurping Zionist regime but 
lost their own popular, political, and practical legitimacy and 
intensified their own crisis. 
  In other words, although they held a superficial concern for 
confronting Israel until a deal was made, after signing [the 
peace agreements] they were confronted with a domestic crisis 
and had no opportunity to continue their rule. 
  It is not possible to solve the Middle East crisis on paper 
and this will not come about through a deal with the Zionist 
regime. 
  Those concerned about the historic Middle East and 
Palestinian struggle should concentrate on the destruction of 
the Zionist regime and the correction of the region's 
geo-politics. 
  In short, and finally, it is possible to say that the most 
important and practical achievements of the Geneva meeting were 
in the possible expansion of relations between Syria and 
America, rather than a fundamental change in the regional 
process. 
  This is so, despite the fact that America and Israel will 
try 
to exploit the meeting for their own particular ends.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Beirut correspondent Muhammad Bishkar] </F>
  [Text] The outcome of the Geneva summit yesterday between 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
has created the impression that what took place was a discussion 
of broad matters and that the summit never touched on the minute 
details which confuse the Middle East's problems. Such details 
were left for committees and subcommittees and for the two 
countries' foreign ministers. This means that the 
implementation of what has been agreed upon will take a long 
time, and this in itself dampens the hopes of Arabs and 
non-Arabs who are in a hurry to normalize ties with Israel and 
make peace with that country. 
  The United States said what it wanted through its president, 
and the Syrian president said what he wanted, but what the two 
sides desire do not concur in substance, although the U.S. media 
tried to show superficial agreement between the two presidents 
at the Geneva summit. 
  The problem with the United States is that it is not neutral 
in the conflict with the Zionist state but is supportive of this 
state in political, economical, and security areas. The United 
States' aim in the peace process, which was launched in Madrid 
over two years ago, is only to perpetuate Israel's strength on 
all levels at the expense of Arabs and Muslims. This obvious 
U.S. stance, which has been manifested numerous times in U.S. 
policy on the region, is alone capable of undermining the peace 
process if the opposite side is the Syrian stance that 
contradicts the aims of U.S. policy in the region. 
  As for Israel, where U.S. envoy Dennis Ross rushed to convey 
Clinton's assurances to its officials a few hours after the 
Syrian-U.S. summit, it is practically sure of the U.S. 
Administration's intentions toward it and of Washington's policy 
that gives it an important role in the Middle East's leadership. 
Israel does not object to agreeing with Syria and other Arab 
countries to normalize diplomatic, economic, and even social 
ties. But so far it is not ready to give the Arabs any 
(?concession), not in terms of land, security, or economics. 
  If anything, the Geneva summit shows the United States' 
extreme concern to make the region's settlement process a 
success in line with its own interests and domination of the 
region's resources and wealth.

<F P=106> [Hasan Fathi commentary: "Clinton, Hafiz al-Asad in Quest </F>
of Peace"] 
  [Text] A while ago it was announced that the U.S. 
Secretary of State is to travel to the Middle East. Contrary to 
some analysts, we wrote that this visit would exert a positive 
effect on the trend of Middle East talks, similar to the 
previous visits. 
  The previous visit by Christopher culminated in the signing 
of the accord between Rabin and 'Arafat on autonomy for Gaza and 
Jericho. The latest visit resulted in setting up a meeting 
between the presidents of the United States and Syria, Clinton 
and Hafiz al-Asad, in Geneva. 
  The two presidents are expected to meet in Geneva at the end 
of January to exchange views on the Middle East peace talks, 
which have been described as a turning point in the Middle East. 
  This meeting comes at a time of stalemate in the Middle East 
talks. 'Arafat's opponents -- who are being supported by Syria 
and by the Government of Lebanon and Hizballah who are involved 
in this conflict -- have not yet shown any inclination to 
compromise. In view of the current situation, if the meeting 
between the heads of the United States and Syria takes place and 
is successful, it could be considered a turning point in the 
Middle East, because we would then witness some changes in the 
region. 
  Syria and its President wish to be considered the leaders of 
the Arab world and to have the key to peace or opposition to 
Israel in their hands. One of the reasons for Damascus' 
opposition to the Rabin-'Arafat accord is the fact that Syria 
was forestalled by 'Arafat, who shook hands with Rabin before 
Syria could. 
  If the covert talks between Syria and Israel that have been 
going on bear fruit, Damascus will have taken the control of the 
key to peace and Lebanon may follow their lead. 
  If the United States now grants some privileges to Syria and 
remove it from its list of supporters of terrorism, it will be 
merely because Washington and Tel Aviv are seeking to attract 
Damascus into the coterie of the peace proponents along with 
other opponents of 'Arafat, including Lebanon. That is why the 
'Arafat-Rabin talks are taking place. 
  At present Syria is the most important supporter of the 
opponents of 'Arafat and the PLO-Israel accord. The convocation 
of the 10-member Palestinian group in Damascus marks the 
resumption of the opponents' activities. Similarly, the 
Lebanese Government, which has problems with Israel over its 
southern border, is following Syria's policy. In the event 
Syria joins the peace trend, the groups opposing 'Arafat as well 
as Lebanon will be forced to resolve their problems with the 
Zionists and to halt their opposition. 
  Syria wants the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, 
which have been occupied by the Zionists since the 1967 six-day 
Arab-Israel war, after which they were annexed by the Zionist 
regime with the endorsement of their parliament. Israel has 
given some guarantees to Syria in this regard, but Syria needs 
the United States to intervene and endorse these guarantees; 
that is why Hafiz al-Asad and Clinton are going to meet and 
exchange views. 
  If Hafiz al-Asad can obtain sufficient guarantees from 
Clinton in Geneva, he will certainly join the peace trend 
without doubt. In that case, the old Camp David scenario will 
be implemented in full, and the problem of the Middle East and 
Palestine will be completely resolved, in the opinion of the 
United States. Of course, suppression of the Hizballah and the 
Islamic movements will be the next stage; and at that juncture, 
the governments of Syria and Lebanon will have conflicting 
stances.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 18 -- An English daily Tuesday said 
that Tehran expected Damascus to send a special envoy to Iran to 
inform Iranian officials of the details of Sunday talks between 
the American and Syrian heads of states. 
  The morning daily `TEHRAN TIMES' commented in its editorial 
on the Geneva meeting between Syria's President Hafiz al-Asad 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  "Although the details of the negotiations have not yet been 
made available to the media, all evidences point to the 
conclusion that the American President could not get the Syrian 
leader to accept the American point of view as easily he could 
prevail upon (PLO Chairman Yasir) 'Arafat or his predecessor had 
been able to make (President) Anwar al-Sadat (of Egypt) yield to 
the American pressure." 
  In a press conference held after the talks, President 
al-Asad 
held firmly to his rightful stance, demanding Israeli withdrawal 
from all territories occupied in 1967 six-day war or 
comprehensive peace settlement with all Arab countries at once. 
  Turning to the strategem used by the Zionist regime during 
the past two decades on separate bilateral talks and settlements 
with individual Arab states, it said "the obvious objective and 
natural consequence of that strategem is of course to create 
discord among the Arab ranks." 
  Turning to President al-Asad's display of awareness of the 
fact that the American President's promises could not be relied 
on, the paper said "the gap between what is promised by the 
American President and what is actually done by Tel Aviv leaders 
is extremely wide." 
  "It would of course be quite unwise to pass a hasty 
judgement 
on the meeting between al-Asad and Clinton before details of 
their negotiations are known." 
  The daily said with regards to the cordial ties between Iran 
and Syria, "it is quite natural that Tehran should be expecting 
President al-Asad's special envoy in the coming days with 
details of the negotiations between the heads of America and 
Syria."

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 15, IRNA -- An English daily Saturday 
editorialized on the forthcoming Paris meeting of G7 and said 
the U.S. will make attempts to divert the attention of Europe 
from economic bottlenecks that Washington is faced with. 
  Pointing to the main topic of the meeting which will be 
Iran's foreign debts, the daily 'TEHRAN TIMES' said it can be 
foreseen that Clinton's representatives will be using irrelevant 
issues such as human rights violation, Iran's stance on 
'Arafat-Rabin accord and Iran's so-called arms purchases to 
distract the attention of the Europeans from America's real 
economic objective. 
  "The truth of the matter is that in the present economic 
conditions dominated by a general recession in the U.S. the most 
urgent objective for the U.S. companies and trusts is to capture 
the large Iranian market or to have access at least to certain 
sections of that market", the daily noted. 
  Therefore, noted the daily, the real objective of the 
American pressure on the European countries in the Paris meeting 
is to make them exert pressure in turn on Iran for the purpose 
of opening up opportunities for the American companies. 
  Referring to a recent telephon conversation of President 
Rafsanjani and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the daily said the 
chancellor had clearly promised that differences over the 
repayment of loans between the Iranian and German companies 
would soon be resolved. 
  "It is quite surprising to find out that the German central 
government is acting contrary to the promises of its chancellor 
and the interests of its companies", the paper concluded.

  [Text] Saudi Minister of Higher Education 'Abd-al-'Aziz al- 
Khuwaytir, who is carrying Saudi King Fahd's message for Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, called on the Iranian President Saturday 
evening. During the meeting, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani pointed to 
regional issues, as well as falling world oil prices, as among 
the most basic issues that warrant cooperation among all Muslim 
countries, especially Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Iranian 
president also stressed the need for greater unity and 
cooperation between Islamic countries. 
  The meeting between the Saudi minister and the Iranian 
president has attracted the attention of many political 
observers. Though Iran-Saudi Arabian ties have undergone 
several ups and downs during recent years, the trend of events 
of recent months reveal that the two countries' officials, in 
view of the significance of Iran-Saudi unity and the need for 
expanding bilateral cooperation, have opened a new phase of 
bilateral ties with the intention of reinforcing unity among 
Islamic countries and overcoming the problems of the Muslim 
world. 
  Iran-Saudi ties basically have wide dimensions, since they 
are the major oil-producing countries among OPEC members. In 
connection with oil production, analysts believe cooperation 
between Iran and Saudi Arabia, with the largest oil and gas 
reserves in the world, can play a significant role in 
stabilizing oil prices; so much so that economic experts say the 
two countries can have a great impact on checking the falling 
price of oil, stabilizing it on the world market. 
  Besides, the two countries' membership in the Organization 
of 
Islamic Conference, the OIC, further reveals the significance of 
bilateral relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. This is so 
because, if the two countries reach a ground for bilateral 
understanding, their key and effective role in improving the 
situation of the Muslim ummah [community] will become 
undeniable. Therefore, under the present conditions, when bloody 
fighting in some Islamic countries has created a difficult 
situation, the (?power) of Muslim ummah coordination among the 
OIC member states, especially Iran and Saudi Arabia, can be of 
special significance in following up the problems of Muslim 
nations. It is worth noting that during the meeting, President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani welcomed the deepening of ties in the areas 
of mutual interest, stressing the need for the exchange of 
economic and political delegations between the two countries to 
bring the viewpoints of Iran and Saudi Arabia closer. The 
president said he would send a special envoy to Saudi Arabia 
soon to hold talks on issues of mutual interest and to present a 
message to King Fahd in response to the one sent by the Saudi 
king.

  [Text] While mediation efforts are under way to bring an 
end to the recent fighting in Kabul, the sides involved in the 
clashes have offered their conditions for ending the fighting. 
  According to a spokesman for the Afghan prime minister's 
Hezb-e-Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], the president 
should step down, a transitional government set up, a national 
army formed, and elections held after six months. 
  Meanwhile the spokesman for Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic 
Society 
of Afghanistan] led by President Borhanoddin Rabbani, says Mr. 
Rabbani will remain as president, and stressed that the 
government will accept the ceasefire if the opponents remove 
their heavy weapons from around Kabul. 
  This is at a time when it does not seem the two sides can 
come to the negotiation table under the bases of conditions they 
have proposed. 
  What complicates the situation is the two sides' 
unwillingness to compromise under demands because of the 
sensitivity and significance they attach to their political 
positions. 
  It seems impossible to reach an agreement on the basis of 
good will as long as a climate of forgiveness is not allowed to 
prevail over the inter-Afghan parties' relations. 
  According to observers of Afghan affairs, a change in the 
political situation in Kabul cannot help create peace and push 
forward peace objectives either, because it is hard to conceive 
an end to the war as long as political objectives are being 
achieved through the use of arms and military force. 
  Experience, however, shows that under such difficult 
conditions faced by Afghanistan, friendly and neighboring 
countries -- not withstanding their divergent views of the sides 
involved in the fighting -- have been able to persuade them to 
hold negotiations. The ongoing war in Kabul will lead to the 
same conclusion. 
  According to the special envoy of the Iranian foreign 
minister to Kabul, all sides have welcomed the mediation efforts 
of friendly and neighboring countries. 
  Mr. [Mohammad Ibrahim] Taherian [Iran's special envoy for 
Afghan affairs] returned to Islamabad on 12 January after 
meeting the leaders of the warring sides in Kabul. In an 
interview, he said it is not ready to persuade the two sides to 
hold negotiations. 
  He reiterated that the Iranian Foreign Ministry is trying to 
create the ground for carrying out mediation between the Afghan 
groups through consultations with the officials of the Pakistani 
Foreign Ministry and other Islamic countries.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 15 (AFP) -- Iran has launched mediation 
efforts to end the conflict between the Islamic opposition and 
the government in Tajikistan, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas 
Maleki [spelling as received] said Saturday. 
  Iranian officials had already held talks with Tajik 
opposition representatives and were due to meet with Tajik 
government officials on January 24 or 25, he said. 
  The initiative followed a request from four Moslem Central 
Asian states -- Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and 
Kazakhstan -- for Iran to play a more active role in ending the 
conflict, during a visit to the region by Iranian President 'Ali 
Akbar Hashemi- Rafsanjani in October. 
  Maleki said Iran was concerned about the situation and was 
determined to use its influence to restore security to 
Tajikistan. 
  The results of the discussions would be conveyed to the four 
Central Asian states, Maleki said, and if necessary a summit 
meeting would be held. 
  Pro-communist forces seized power in Dushanbe in December 
1992, toppling the ruling coalition of democratic and Islamic 
forces. 
  Uzbek President Islam Karimov has called for direct talks 
between the communist-dominated Tajik government and the 
opposition, mediated by "influential Moslem states such as Iran, 
Pakistan and Afghanistan." 
  During Rafsanjani's regional tour Kyrgyz President Askar 
Akayev also asked Iran to help end the crisis in Tajikistan. 
  However, Iran has adopted a low profile toward the conflict 
to avoid antagonising the former Soviet Central Asian countries, 
with which it has been trying to boost economic and cultural 
ties. 
  A Russian special envoy, Yevgeniy Primakov, visited Iran in 
August for talks with Iranian officials on defusing tension on 
the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  A UN special envoy also visited Iran for talks on the 
conflict last August.

  [Text] The director general of the Interior Ministry's 
foreign nationals and emigrants department said today at a 
seminar attended by the heads of this organization's 
representative offices from all over the country: The Islamic 
Republic government is ready to repatriate more than 700,000 
Afghans and 50,000 Iraqi refugees to their countries next year 
[beginning 21 March 1994], if the refugees agree to return home. 
  According to our correspondent, at the time of the United 
States' military attack on Iraq, the number of immigrants and 
refugees seeking asylum in Iran reached 5.5 million. However, 
more than three million of them have gradually returned to their 
countries and at present there are about 2.5 million foreign 
nationals and refugees in Iran. Of this figure, 1,850,000 are 
Afghans, 645,000 are Iraqis, and 65,000 are from other countries. 
  At today's session of the seminar the interior minister said 
in his speech that refugees will continue coming to Iran until 
political and economic stability returns to our neighboring 
countries.

noted that the U.S. and the west were thinking in vain to obtain 
their goals through Caucasus. The Azeri official told IRNA that 
plots hatched by the U.S. and the west were threatening unity 
among Muslim populated republics in Central Asia. He said what 
is presently hindering the process of development in Central 
Asia is attempts made by Russia to seperate the Muslim republics 
from Iran.

'Ali Akbar Velayati sent a message to Armenian Foreign Minister 
Vahan Papazyan on 13 January. The message says: Being a 
supporter of the establishment of peace in the Caucasian region, 
last year Iran used its mediation efforts to attain this 
important objective. 
  Dr. Velayati also noted that war and bloodshed have had 
harmful affects on Armenia and Azerbaijan, and the continuation 
of the conflict could disrupt relations between all the regional 
countries, and could be used as pretext by those who want to 
(?escalate) the crisis. 
  Next, the message highly assessed the Armenian Republic's 
important and valuable role in the effort to establish peace and 
stability in the Karabakh conflict zone. In this connection, 
Dr. Velayati noted that his country is ready to take all 
possible steps [passage indistinct]. 
  At the end of his message, Dr. Velayati referred to Iran's 
(?efforts) to bring about the immediate termination of the 
military operations and bloodshed -- which is one of the 
principles of Iranian foreign policy -- and hoped that in the 
new Christian year [words indistinct].

  [Text] Algerian Defense Minister General Zerval [title and 
name as heard] announced yesterday that if the talks between the 
government and some opposing factions on the subject of an 
interim cabinet and its term of office achieve no results, the 
Armed Forces will not remain indifferent. This implies that in 
two weeks, when the period specified by the Algerian Ruling 
Council expires, the Armed Forces may directly assume power. 
  Political observers say that the Algerian defense minister's 
threatening remarks, even if they are put into practice, will 
not have a very significant effect on the country's political 
scene. Since the Boumedienne coup d'etat in the sixties, the 
Algerian Armed Forces have held the reins of power and even now 
are the power behind the Algerian Ruling Council. The threat 
that the Armed Forces may enter the fray directly will change 
little in the circumstances. 
  And the Algerian Armed Forces have a very (?defensive) 
position in the crisis in the country and cannot become a very 
active force in resolving the Algerian crisis. The Algerian 
Armed Forces are not a homogeneous body and are politically 
polarized between the government and the Islamists and are thus 
plagued by an overt dichotomy of loyalties. 
  This issue, which has spilled out of the country, and the 
imposition of conditions by international powers on the Algerian 
Ruling Council, undermining its position, could be the real 
reason behind the remarks by the Algerian defense minister. In 
other words, his allegations seem to be more propaganda, aimed 
at projecting the impression that the Algerian Armed Forces 
enjoy a unified capability that can enable them to assume power 
in the country. 
  Some political observers believe that the defense minister's 
recent remarks relate to the resumption of the negotiations 
between the government and the opposing factions on delegating 
power and on the length of the tenure of the interim government. 
These talks, which began months ago, have failed to achieve any 
outcome. The Algerian Government has not extended an invitation 
to the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and by providing privileges 
to other factions, it seeks to elicit support for the current 
illegal government and thus forge a united front and an 
extensive coalition of non-Islamic factions. Thus, it is 
striving to replace the Ruling Council with a strong non-Islamic 
coalition. 
  The threatening remarks of the Algerian defense minister a 
few days before negotiations between the government and the 
opposing factions resume may aim to motivate the opposition to 
accept the government's wishes. By not including the FIS, the 
key player in Algeria, which enjoys legitimacy and a popular 
base, these talks are doomed to fail even before they begin. 
The only development that has taken place with regard to these 
talks is that by exposing the government's weakness and a 
significant tilt in the balance between the government and the 
Islamists, the non-Islamic factions are not ready to gamble away 
their future. 
  The most important faction participating in the talks 
between 
the government and the opposition, the Socialist Front, recently 
announced its abstention from these talks and other factions are 
in the midst of deciding whether they should participate in the 
upcoming talks. This has placed the Algerian Ruling Council in 
a major political quandary, because it has invested much to 
achieve even half-baked legitimacy by seeking to elicit the 
support of the other secular factions. This hope is likely to 
become chagrin. 
  If the Ruling Council is defeated on this path, it's only 
choice will be to extend its tenure for a third time, without 
recourse to the will of the people, or to think more 
intelligently and delegate power to those who are popularly 
elected.

  [Editorial Report] Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran First Program Network in Persian at 1600 GMT on 17 January 
carries in its "World of Politics" program a recorded interview 
with Mohammad Mahdavi, Foreign Ministry director general for 
Africa, on relations with South Africa. 
  In reply to a question as to what led Iran to decide to 
establish ties with South Africa, Mahdavi says: "It should noted 
that diplomatic ties have not been established with South 
Africa. After the elections in April 1994, when the deprived 
and suffering people of South Africa have attained their rights 
and taken over the management of the country, we will, God 
willing, establish diplomatic ties with South Africa. But what 
was recently approved in the country and brought to the 
attention of the people was the lifting of the restrictions we 
had on our economic ties with South Africa." 
  Mahdavi then comments on the events leading to the 
forthcoming free elections and abrogation of apartheid in South 
Africa. 
  On the reason for Iran's decision, he says: "What led us to 
decide to establish economic ties with South Africa was, first, 
the recent events in South Africa and, second, the direct 
request of the combative groups in South Africa, who wrote to us 
and asked us to lift the restrictions on trade with South 
Africa. However, we have deferred the establishment of 
diplomatic ties, which will be the main basis of relations 
between our country and South Africa, until after the elections, 
when every black person has attained his rights there." 
  Asked about Western media propaganda about Iran's u-turn in 
its policy on Israel and South Africa, Mahdavi says: "They, 
themselves, know that they are not being truthful and that what 
they are saying is not correct. We have declared our stance on 
these two from the start. About South Africa, we said that when 
racism is abolished there and the oppressed and innocent people 
of South Africa take over power -- on the basis of one man one 
vote -- we would establish diplomatic and economic ties with 
that country. And we are moving in that direction now. 
However, our stance on the Zionist regime has been clear from 
the start. His holiness the imam said that the Zionist regime 
must be destroyed. Yes, when the Zionist regime is destroyed 
and the people of Palestine take over power, our relations with 
the people of Palestine -- which is now occupied, but will then 
be free -- will be established."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "North Korean Delegation Visits </F>
Tehran To Consolidate Military Cooperation"] 
  [Excerpt] London, Tehran, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Sources in 
Tehran confirmed yesterday that Iran and North Korea were 
preparing to hold high-level talks on the development of new 
weapon systems, including medium- and long-range missiles. 
  The talks are expected to begin tomorrow, Saturday, with the 
North Korean delegation visiting Tehran headed by Air Force 
Commander General Cho Myong-nok. The Iranian side in the talks 
will be headed by Revolutionary Guard Commander General Mohsen 
Reza'i. 
  Gen. Cho arrived in Tehran yesterday at the head of a 
delegation of 28 scientists, technicians, and officers. This is 
the first time in a decade that a North Korean high-level 
military delegation officially visits a noncommunist state. 
  The issue of additional cooperation in the field of 
ballistic 
weapons will top the agenda. Iran had originally purchased 
about 800 Soviet-type Scud missiles from North Korea but it is 
now investing in the development of a new version of the Scud-C 
missile known as Nodong-2 [number as published] with a range of 
600 miles, according to Western experts. The new missile can 
carry chemical and nuclear warheads and hit almost any Middle 
Eastern capital. 
  The first version of that missile was scheduled to be tested 
in Iran last September but the testing was postponed at the last 
moment, probably because the two parties were worried about the 
presence of U.S. spy satellites and AWACS planes in the region. 
  The strength of Iranian-North Korean relations could perhaps 
be gauged on the basis of the number of visits exchanged between 
the two countries. North Korea is the only country in the world 
to have visited Iran's leader 'Ali Khamene'i and all his 
important aides including President Hashemi-Rafsanjani.

  [Text] London, Jan. 14, IRNA -- The new memorandum of 
understanding, signed in Dublin this week, offers wide-ranging 
possibilities in numerous areas of expanding and diversifying 
economic cooperation between Ireland and the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. 
  According to the memorandum, mutual benefits have been 
identified in such fields as heavy and light industry, mining, 
agriculture, rural and urban planning, petroleum and oil 
products, pharmaceuticals, medicine, telecommunications and 
education. 
  Proposed are a whole set of possible initiatives through 
mutual investments, joint ventures, development projects, 
utilizing the capabilities of expertise, management skills, 
professional training and courses, holding seminars, conferences 
and exhibitions. 
  During the holding of the second joint commission Wednesday 
and Thursday, Iranian and Irish officials expressed their 
satisfation with the ever-growing and deepending trend of 
relations that was attributed to the atmosphere of understanding 
developed between the two countries. 
  To take advantage of the opportunities, both sides agreed to 
increase the exchange of information and contacts to acquaint 
themselves with each other's markets and expert industries and 
to maximize the potential offered. 
  Proposals went as far as encouraging economic and trade 
enterprises to embark on joint activities for exports to third 
markets, such as to the newly-independent republics of Europe 
and Central Asia. 
  Ireland itself has a population of only 3.5 million, but it 
has a projected GDP growth of 3 percent this year, higher than 
most countries in the European Union, of which it is a member. 
  The major development in economic relations last year was in 
the reopening of Iran's beef market to Irish exporters, which 
has the potential of being the second largest after Britain. 
  The move has the potential of creating a trade imbalance in 
Dublin's favor, but both sides recognized the need to correct 
this to expand the volume of business between the two countries. 
  To this end, Irish officials welcomed the desire for Iranian 
enterprises to have an active presence in the Irish market and 
committed to help arrange `Iran weeks' and exclusive trade fairs 
to promote exports to Ireland. 
  Dublin further agreed to consider favorably oil imports from 
Iran to meet its considerable needs, while the Iranian side 
expressed its readiness for cooperation in refining and jont 
investment for the construction of refineries.

<F P=106> [Address by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic </F>
revolution, on the occasion of Islamic Revolution Guard Corps 
Day amd the birth anniversary of Husayn, the third Shiite imam, 
to members of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps and the law 
enforcement forces at the Imam Khomeyni mosque in Tehran on 16 
January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [crowd chants: "We are all your soldiers, 
Khamene'i. We are ready to receive your orders, Khamene'i," and 
other slogans] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. On this great and auspicious day I sincerely 
congratulate all freedom-loving and justice-seeking people of 
the world, and particularly the great Iranian nation, the brave 
youth of this land, and the offspring of the Koran; that is, the 
dear guards of the revolution and you, dear participants. 
[passage omitted] 
  Today Islam is flourishing in the world. Today Islam is 
attracting nations to itself as the most brilliant and clear 
source of hope. Is this a joke, after the passage of 1,400 
years? It is due to the blessings of the uprising of Husayn 
Bin-'Ali. It is Almighty God's wish that, for the first time 
since the era of Husayn Bin-'Ali, the Koran should rule in the 
Islamic Republic. Everything that has been done since Imam 
Husayn's uprising has been an introduction to today for you. 
All those scholars, thinkers, philosophers, and speakers; all 
those efforts and all the Crusader wars -- throughout it all, 
Islam was protected and conditions were prepared for today, so 
that a government be created that is based on divine and Koranic 
values. You, the Iranian nation, were fortunate to have the 
opportunity to be trusted, for the first time, with that 
responsibility. [passage omitted] This is not something that 
will end. Do not think that the Islamic Republic is going to be 
destroyed by the utterances of a few simple-minded wishful 
thinkers who say it is going to end today or tomorrow. No, sir. 
These foundations are not going be annihilated. [Crowd chants: 
"God is great;" "Khamene'i is the leader;" "Death to America;" 
"Death to Israel," and other slogans] 
  You and I will of course come to an end. Individuals do not 
go on for ever. The best are those who guard themselves until 
death. And some even fail to do that. There are all types. 
Individuals are vulnerable to damage and destruction. However, 
the basics continue. This Islamic revolution, this Islamic 
revival has its roots in history, in 10 centuries of effort and 
struggle. It relies on Islam, and for this very reason today -- 
at a time when, more than ever, Zionist and arrogant propaganda 
has tried to portray an ugly image of the Islamic Republic, 
Iran, Iranian people, us, and everyone -- popular attraction 
toward Islam, in all parts of the Islamic world, is growing at a 
greater rate than five or 10 years ago. Look at Islamic 
countries. Look at Muslim minorities in non-Islamic countries. 
Look at the harsh measures taken by the arrogant powers against 
Muslims. There is a reason for such severity. If the Muslims 
were like a body at the hands of the mortician, there would be 
no severity. 
  I wish to state that the element of loneliness in the 
contemporary movement has created a degree of similarity between 
us and the movement of Husayn Bin-'Ali. Do not fear the 
loneliness. Do not be scared, for Husayn Bin-'Ali and his 
companions -- for whom we mourn and weep, and whom we love more 
than our own children -- reached the heights of loneliness. The 
result was that Islam is alive today. The events of Karbala' 
[where Husayn died in battle] were not limited to a small region 
but concern a large part of contemporary humanity. Karbala' is 
now everywhere. Look at literature, culture, traditions, and 
beliefs, and at people's hearts. Even the man who does not bow 
down to God respects the greatness of Husayn Bin-'Ali. That was 
the result of loneliness. He was the height of loneliness. And 
today you are lonely and today the Iranian nation is lonely and 
wronged. But its loneliness and meekness does not mean 
weakness. We are very powerful today. No other Muslim nation 
-- and dare to believe this -- is as powerful as the Muslim 
nation of Iran. No other nation, be it small, large, or with a 
population of 100 million. 
  Iran is alone in the world today. The power of the people 
of Iran today is at its zenith; the same applies to the Iranian 
Government. The government is very powerful, very dear; those 
in positions of power in the world pay attention to the 
Government of Iran. The people and the government are strong 
and capable; they know what they are doing. At the same time, 
they are lonely and oppressed. We are alone in the world today. 
No power in the world supports us today. This does not mean 
that all the powers in the world are lined up against us; no, do 
not let our enemies get happy, thinking: Thank God, all the 
powers are against Iran. Even if this was the case, it would 
not matter. We have experienced such a situation. No, today 
all the governments and powers of the world are not lined up 
against us. There are many governments who feel that, 
considering the material criteria that they have, it is not in 
their interest to line themselves up against the Iranian people. 
  But no one helps or supports our people. The most powerful, 
arrogant powers of the world confront our people, are enemies of 
our people. They oppress the Iranian people, they do not take 
their rights into account, they make accusations against our 
people. They do not consider our people's good points, and they 
make a mountain out of a molehill of our bad points. This is 
the oppression and loneliness of the Iranian people. This 
oppression and loneliness should make you stronger. I say that 
this is a blessing from God. Some corruption exists, but the 
structure of society is healthy. If we were like one of those 
so-called revolutionary countries of the previous era -- today 
they do not exist...[pauses] There used to be certain 
countries and governments that were so-called revolutionary, 
they were supported by one of the bullying powers of that era, 
the Soviet Union, which supported them. If we were like them, 
our people and government would have been corrupted. You see 
today that the people and government have, thank God, remained 
healthy. This does not mean that there is no corruption among 
the people or officials; there is to a certain extent, but the 
structure is healthy, the composition is healthy, the main 
elementsare healthy; members of the society who occupy sensitive 
positions are healthy. This is a great blessing. This blessing 
comes from being alone, from relying on no one but God. 
  There are two trends. One is the trend of Islam, the Koran, 
divine values, and spirituality, with the Islamic Republic at 
its zenith. Officials of this system are standing up under this 
enormous pressure, strongly and without fear or hesitation. 
They are happy and do not bow down. This is one trend. The 
other trend consists of all the satans of the world, all the 
evil ones of the world. All the mischievous ones of the world 
belong to the other trend. 
  There exists a division here. If anyone has any energy, 
where should he expend that energy? If anyone has anything to 
say, if anyone can take the initiative, where should he be? If 
someone inside this faction of righteousness, or outside this 
faction of righteousness, starts to wage a war on this faction 
-- which is fighting mischief and evil to such an extent -- 
based on the premise that this faction of righteousness has not 
paid attention to a particular point, or committed a small 
mistake, error, or even sin, can this be right? Is this not 
weakening divine power in the line of blaspheming against the 
blessings of God? 
  Those who have nothing to say apart from utterances that 
weaken the front of righteousness, weaken the officials, weaken 
the government, the president, the judiciary, the Majles, using 
any excuse ... [pauses] For example, they say: The judiciary 
issued the wrong sentence in such and such a case; such and such 
a judge said this; such and such a government official acted in 
such and such a way. Rather than expending their energy to 
confront the faction of evil, they use these excuses and use the 
same energy to fight against the faction of righteousness. Are 
they not blaspheming against the blessings of God? Don't they 
deserve divine punishment?

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "In the Margin of the Interior </F>
Minister's Remarks in Majles"] 
  [Text] The esteemed Interior Minister Mr. Besharati's 
answer to a question by Rasht Deputy Elyas Hazrati about why 
students of the Unity Consolidation Bureau [UCB] were not 
allowed to stage a rally against the United States on 2 November 
[on the anniversary of the occupation of the American Embassy in 
Tehran], is worthy of discussion since, as he himself stated, 
our Islamic revolution is a revolution against world blasphemy 
and oppression and its symbol-- the United States--in the world 
today. The need for a multifaceted struggle in all its 
dimensions against the United States was repeatedly pointed out 
by the founder of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeyni--may his 
soul be sanctified--and by Ayatollah Khamene'i, leader of the 
Islamic revolution. But neither of them said that this struggle 
should be carried out at a specific time and specific place. 
  Basically speaking, our revolution is a popular revolution; 
and when the Muslim people of Iran and the revolutionary strata, 
especially the combatant students--despite their tastes and 
political platforms--want to work toward this objective [a 
popular revolution] within the framework of the recognized laws 
and regulations of the country, no obstacles should be raised 
for them. In his remarks, Mr. Besharati listed several reasons 
why the student rally was banned. But none of these reasons are 
justifiable, either from the legal or revolutionary aspects. 
  1. He said: "We disagreed with the rally that the UCB 
students had proposed because we are in favor of a show of unity 
by our nation, which can become a powerful phenomenon that can 
prevent and thwart any aggression or overt or covert 
intervention in this society and this unity. This was the main 
reason for our disagreement." 
  First of all, the rally that was proposed by the students 
was not to take place parallel with the official march that had 
been planned, but two days before the official march. But where 
does it say that permission should be granted for an expression 
of aversion to the United States on a specific day, at a 
specific time, and in a specific way? 
  Also, the UCB is a student organization that is allowed to 
operate on the basis of our Islamic country's laws; and rallies 
can be held under any circumstance, on any day, and in any form 
by requesting permission from the interior minister provided 
that the rally will not impair public order and security in the 
country. And if the Interior Ministry--as the executor of law 
and order--feels that such a request would disrupt national 
order and security, it should clearly state why it believes so. 
  There is no doubt that coordination, unity of methods, unity 
of tastes, and so on are positive and ideal points. But the 
responsibility that the Interior Ministry has is a legal 
responsibility. On what points did the students' request for 
permission conflict with the recognized laws of the Interior 
Ministry? Should a march against the United States be held only 
on a specific day and under the supervision of one specific 
institution? Then what is the meaning of the freedom to express 
one's views, to protest, and the freedom to hold legal 
demonstrations? Is the Interior Ministry a legislative or 
policy- making body or is it an executor of law? If such issues 
were to be dealt with through such channels, then the Majles 
should have approved a law saying that demonstrations against 
oppressive and despotic America should be carried out only in an 
official manner and through the channels of official 
institutions. 
  2. The second reason which the esteemed interior minister 
gave referred to a circular issued by the representative of the 
religious leader and the Islamic Publicity Coordination 
Council's secretary that states that "on the basis of the 
attached copy of Circular No. ... [ellipsis as published] of the 
esteemed president, the Islamic Propaganda Coordination Council 
is in charge of organizing and directing all public and official 
ceremonies and rallies." 
  The rally which the students wanted to hold was not of this 
nature. A number of students, an association, and a legal 
student formation wanted to march and to demonstrate. This 
could not be categorized as an official and public march that 
falls under the jurisdiction of the country's official 
institutions. Therefore, it was not correct to refer to this 
circular. If the UCB students had applied for permission to 
organize an official ceremony on the national level, then 
naturally this circular would have applied, and whether it is 
correct or not, the Interior Ministry could have opposed it. 
But in the students' application to the Interior Ministry there 
was no sign of the students' intention to hold an official rally 
at the national level. 
  3. Another reason given by the esteemed interior minister 
was that "it is not our duty to safeguard each person under any 
circumstances and to grant permission and extend facilities for 
rallies." 
  First of all, if the request is legal and within the 
framework of state regulations, then on the basis of law, the 
Interior Ministry should grant permission and extend the 
necessary facilities, whether the interior minister likes it or 
not. Secondly, in this country with its Muslim, revolutionary, 
and anti-American people, anti- American demonstrations--and by 
Muslim and committed students at that--are not dangerous; danger 
emanates only from pro-U.S. elements. Those who struggle 
against America do not fear the mentors of arrogance. This 
remark by the interior minister means that had the Interior 
Ministry not ensured security, the demonstrators might have been 
attacked and would not have been safe. But it is clear that the 
devoted Iranian people have nothing to fear, that if there is 
insecurity it is created by the supporters of America, and that 
it is the duty of the Interior Ministry to make the supporters 
of America feel insecure. Our people, our students, and our 
officials are so broadminded that they are unaffected when they 
hear what those who explicitly do not consider America to be an 
enemy and who want relations with it -- contrary to the thought 
of Imam Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified, and what the 
leader of the revolution has so explicitly stated. But not only 
do those who utter such words not feel any insecurity, they even 
resort to various means to express so-called expert views on the 
topic. Now, how can one accept a situation where certain people 
who without doubt are Muslim, revolutionary, and committed 
persons and followers of the leader cannot express their 
opposition to America as they wish, or accept for this wish of 
theirs to be considered as an act that spreads discord in the 
national ranks and that their legal rights be ignored while 
people like the esteemed Majles deputy Raja'i-Khorasani are 
allowed to speak without considering their own remarks as being 
discordant? Just as we believe that any person-- whether a 
Majles deputy or anyone else--can say what he wants within the 
framework of his beliefs, ethics, and the law and order of this 
Islamic country as long as he does not insult or act against the 
interests of Islam and of the country and that he should not 
feel insecure, in the same way others too should be able to 
enjoy these rights. 
  Of course, there are also other points in Mr. Besharati's 
remarks, which we will discuss at another time. But the main 
point is that we should act within the framework of the system 
and of its laws to preserve the rights of the members of this 
society; and this is only possible when we do not mix personal 
tastes and assessments with executive decisions.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 15, IRNA -- Chief of staff of the 
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Brigardier General 
Mohammad Badqer Zolqadr said here Saturday that the infiltration 
of anti-revolutionaries through the country's western borders 
has greatly been checked since the deployment of IRGC 
contingents in the area. The casualties suffered by terrorist 
elements as a result of IRGC vigilance has increased ten times, 
and included top ringleaders, he said. 
  Zolqadr was outlining the corps' activities on the eve of 
IRGC Day marking the birth anniversary of Imam Hoseyn (peace be 
upon him) whose selfless struggle has continued to inspire 
revolutionaries in every age and era. 
  The prophet's (pbuh) younger grandson who tasted the cup of 
martyrdom in Karbala in 61 A.H. (680 A.D.) in order to resurrect 
Islam was born in al-Madinah on the 3rd of Sha'ban (falling this 
year on Jan. 16) in the fourth year of the Hijra. 
  Zolqadr said that in the fight against drug trafficking, 
IRGC 
personnel have destroyed 50 convoys of international traffickers 
and seized 14.5 tons of illicit drugs this year. 
  He added that the IRGC killed in shoot-outs or arrested 940 
smugglers in the eastern part of the country in the said period.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 15, IRNA -- Law enforcement forces have 
arrested 17 suspects in connection with a bombing at Ferdowsi 
Square in central Tehran Thursday [13 January] night as well as 
shooting at the British Embassy in Tehran on January 9, an 
official said today. 
  Four of the arrested were released after preliminary 
interrogations, Colonel Reza Mohammadi, a law enforcement 
officer based in central Tehran told IRNA. 
  Some ofthe detainees have confessed to having links with the 
Iraq-based terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), the 
colonel said. 
  Shortly after the bomb blast at Ferdowsi Square an 
unidentified caller who introduced herself as MKO spokesman in 
Paris claimed responsibility for the bombing which injured three 
passers-by, one critically. 
  The officer disclosed that some arms and ammunition have 
also 
been seized from those arrested. 
  He said because of the ongoing interrogation it was not 
possible for him to identify the arrested people by name. But 
he said they had acknowledged to have received instructions from 
Baghdad and Paris to carry out sabotage activities throughout 
Tehran. 
  MKO members, better known in Iran as monafeqin (hypocrites) 
have launched a string of terrorist attacks since the fleeing to 
Paris of Maryam Qajar Azadanlou, the third wife of MKO 
ringleader Masoud Rajavi. 
  Among the terrorist attacks launched by MKO members were 
hijacking of a passenger plane to Iraq, attacks on the French 
Embassy and Air France office in Tehran, shooting at the British 
Embassy and two bomb explosions in Tehran. 
  Commenting on the connection between the bomb blast at 
Ferdowsi Square and the MKO, Mahmud Javadi, a political expert, 
said: 
  "At present, MKO terrorists cannot leave Iraq without 
getting 
permission from the Baghdad regime and that Western countries 
are reluctant to admit members of this criminal grouplet. So 
the MKO seems to have decided to perpetrate such actions out of 
helplessness." 
  Javadi said that the aim of the MKO in committing such 
crimes was to convince the Baghdad regime that it was still able 
to involve in sabotage actions inside Iran.

Hashemi, head of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Voice and Vision 
[radio and television], announced this morning in a gathering of 
personnel from the Voice and Vision's public relations office. 
He added: Radio News will begin work on the occasion of the 
blessed 10 Days of Dawn [anniversary of the revolution during 
the first ten days of February]. 
  Mr. Hashemi said with regards to the need for the creation 
of 
Radio News: Because news tends to be generated constantly and 
because current bulletins are broadcast at specific times, Radio 
News was felt to be needed, and work on the planning and 
implementation was set into motion. As a result, this radio 
will begin work soon. 
  According to this report, Radio News will broadcast three to 
five minutes of political, economic, sports, scientific, and 
cultural news every 15 minutes. Radio News will broadcast 
between 0630 in the morning and 2100. 
  The Voice and Vision chief added: At the beginning, Radio 
News will be received within the boundaries of greater Tehran; 
efforts will be made to increase its range in the future. Our 
aim is that much of the news we cannot use in current bulletins 
because of time limitations will be broadcast on this radio 
station for the information of our compatriots.

  [Text] Lahore -- Pakistan Army is destroying the left-overs 
of the American ammunition supplied for the war in Afghanistan 
under strict supervision of the US which has flatly refused to 
hand it over to Pakistan. 
  In utter disregard for the 11 years' services rendered to 
the 
US in Afghanistan, the Clinton administration turned down all 
offers made by the Pakistan Government to get or even buy the 
ammunition worth millions of dollars. 
  US experts are now strictly monitoring the destruction of 
ammunition which includes mortars, rockets and artillery gun 
fire. 
  It is better to destroy them here than to give it to the 
country which has no strategic value for us now, seems to be the 
US message. The US, on the face of it, has refused Pakistan's 
offers in the name of the Pressler Amendment which bars all 
kinds of military aid to Pakistan. 
  The Afghans, on the other hand, have refused to return what 
they think is rightfully theirs now. This ammunition dumped in 
various areas of Afghanistan has been confiscated by local 
commanders in Afghanistan. 
  Sources in the Foreign Office were farious that the 11 years 
in which Pakistan watched US interests in the region, even at 
the cost of risking its security, has not won the ammunition 
which should be peanuts for a superpower like America. 
  This ammunition was the last of what remained in the 
pipeline 
after the stoppage of US supply somewhere in 1990. The supply 
was stopped when the US felt that the mission had been 
accomplished after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops. The 
agencies involved in the exercise were asked to freeze the 
supply immediately. The ammunition in the pipeline was dumped 
in various areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Americans, 
realising that the cost of its transportation back to the US 
would be too much decided to destroy the material here. But 
when the time came the local commanders in Afghanistan refused 
to oblige despite various pressures exerted by the Americans. 
Pakistan being an ever obliging country has allowed it without 
any resistance. 
  Interestingly, the US is not very keen about getting back 
ammunition from Afghanistan because it fits in the US scheme of 
things in this region. The US knows that this ammunition will 
be used in Afghan infighting which serves a better purpose for 
the Americans, says the source. 
  But what worries it the most are the lost Stingers which, 
the 
Americans fear, might land into loan and other Muslim countries. 
  A massive witch-hunt is on to trace these Stingers in 
Afghanistan. Price ranging from Rs [Rupees] 4 million to Rs 12 
million is being offered through various agencies to get back 
these missiles. But this missile retrieval exercise is not so 
easy a job. An American was severely injured recently when one 
of Bara-made missiles exploded. In the presence of these fakes, 
in which ordinary explosives are packed in original body, the 
Americans are now more careful when they buy them.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Responsible sources say that 
representatives of the world's leading weapons manufacturing 
companies have become active in Pakistan after the cabinet 
defense committee decided not to depend on only one country for 
defense needs. Various arms producers, through their 
representatives in Pakistan, are trying to influence public 
opinion in a bid to thwart the negotiations for the purchase of 
the Mirage-2000 from France and SU-27 and MiG-29 planes from 
Russia. Important institutions in Pakistan have received 
reports of mysterious activities by representatives of arms 
companies from various countries of the world. Instructed by 
company offices in New Delhi, the representatives are carrying 
out a propaganda campaign in a bid to scuttle the 1989 agreement 
with the United States for the purchase of 60 F-16 planes and to 
thwart the negotiations for the purchase of Mirage-2000 planes 
from France, and SU-27 and MiG-29 aircraft from Russia. 
  Important sources in Rawalpindi said that political-level 
talks with France for the purchase of Mirage-2000 planes have 
ended. Experts of the Pakistan Air Force have approved 
Mirage-2000 planes as technically suitable for induction into 
the Pakistani Air Force. Financial details, however, are yet to 
be worked out and the Government of France and the concerned 
company have been given a financial package proposal. The 
sources said that no political-level talks have been held yet 
with Russia on the purchase of SU-27 and MiG-29 planes. A 
Russian delegation will visit Pakistan soon during which 
Pakistani officials will hold talks on the purchase of these 
planes as well as other matters. 
  The sources said that the test and trial stage for the SU-27 
and MiG-29 planes have not yet begun. It will be after the 
political-level talks between Pakistan and Russia. Therefore, 
it is premature to say anything about the suitability of the 
SU-27 and Mig-29 planes for Pakistan before their test and 
trial. A senior officer in Rawalpindi expressed the hope that 
the people responsible for mobilizing public opinion either for 
or against any issue will act with a greater sense of 
responsibility when dealing with defense-related matters and 
will not turn themselves into the tools of elements attempting 
to exploit the situation after the suspension of the U.S. aid.

<F P=106> [By Aroosa Alam] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad, Jan 13: the wheeler dealers and official 
teams of European countries are in Islamabad to strike lucrative 
defence deals with the Government of Pakistan. 
  This is in the backdrop of the decision of the Defence 
Committee of the Cabinet to diversify defence acquisition and at 
the same time allocating a huge amount for defences purchases. 
  While the Swedish Assistant Secretary of Foreign Affairs is 
already in Islamabad, French Defence Minister Leotard Francois 
is due in the Capital on Saturday to discuss the sale of heavy 
defence equipment to Islamabad. Both are equipped with the 
assurance that their respective governments would ensure the 
uninterrupted supply of weapons even during the times of 
hostilities. 
  French Defence Minister Leotard Francois will discuss the 
sale of Mirage 2000-5 and the French Submarine Agosta-90. He is 
reportedly carrying a confidential letter from his Prime 
Minister to Ms Benazir Bhutto. 
  Described as a hurriedly arranged tour this is the first 
high 
level visit from Paris to Islamabad after the induction of the 
new government is Pakistan. During his two-day stay in the 
Capital, the visiting French Minister, a close confidante of the 
French Prime Minister Baladour, will hold talks with Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto and Foreign and Defence Ministers. 
  Though the visit of the French Defence Minister, handled by 
the Ministry of Defence, is being kept in a low key, it is 
believed the French are desperately trying to conclude deals on 
Mirage -- 2000-5 for PAF [Pakistan Air Force] and submarine for 
the Navy. 
  France is also believed to be offering AMX -- its main 
battle 
tank to the Pakistan Army. 
  Meanwhile, Sweden's Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign 
Affairs is currently visiting Pakistan to offer Pakistan the 
best State of Art defence equipment for its armed forces. 
  The Assistant Secretary of State will be meeting Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto to reaffirm Sweden's irrevocable 
assurances already provided to the Ministry of Defence and the 
navy a few months ago that the Swedish government will honour 
the commitment of any defence contract with Pakistan even during 
a war. He also brought a confidential letter from the Swedish 
Prime Minister for Premier Bhutto, assuring that the Swedish 
decision is fully guaranteed through a political consensus of 
the ruling party as well as the opposition. The Swedes are 
offering A-19 Gotlond submarine with transfer of technology 
besides other sophisticated defence equipment. 
  After carrying out an extensive and objective technical 
evaluation of the Chinese, French and Swedish submarines, 
Pakistan navy has reportedly shown its inclination to go for the 
Swedish submarine, which is considered to be the best. 
  The defence sources in the capital maintain that due to 
political pressures, the Pakistan navy may not be able to 
acquire the Swedish submarine. The sources said that all is set 
to purchase new type of submarine. Agosta-90 which will be 
tailor-made for Pakistan since France itself is shifting to 
nuclear submarine from the conventional submarine. 
  The second item on French Defence Minister's agenda is 
shoving down the expensive Mirage-2000-5 on Pakistan. 
Notwithstanding the apprehensions expressed by the experts time 
and again, PAF leadership is reported to be all set for 
Mirage-2000-5. 
  According to today's BBC broadcast, a contract between 
Taiwan 
and France for the sale of Mirage-2000-5 has been cancelled due 
to some political expediency. Earlier PAF bosses have been 
arguing that Pakistan would not be the sole buyer of 
Mirage-2000-5 and Taiwan was also acquiring the same aircraft. 
  Apparently the French Defence Minister is arriving in 
Pakistan alone. However, there are reports that the agents and 
representatives of M/s DCNI of Agosta-90 submarine, Marcel 
Dassauk of Mirages and OGA have already landed in Islamabad for 
pulling strings with political and defence heavy-weights. 
  During the meeting of the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, 
the Prime Minister informed that the army, navy and air force 
have been given a go ahead to build a viable deterrence by 
restructuring and diversifying their defence capabilities. 
  She instructed the Ministry that the selection of the 
weapons 
should be strictly made on merit of operational performance with 
a clear qualitative edge over enemy's fighting platforms. 
  The Prime Minister directed that in the selection of the 
equipment, maximum weightage must be given to the fact that 
selection must be current and of recent induction in the country 
of origin's armed forces from where the equipment is ordered. 
  She directed that the equipment ordered from abroad must 
have 
life cycle comparable to its country of origin so that the armed 
forces of the selected manufacturer's country must guarantee 
that the equipment selected by the Pakistan's armed forces will 
remain operational for 20 years in their own armed forces as 
primary fighting platforms. 
  The Prime Minister further instructed that the transfer of 
technology must not be a mere lip service but the country 
offering their equipment must have experience and proof of such 
transfer of technology to another country. 
  She emphasised that because of our bad experience during 
conflicts and wars, the seller must have evidence in irrevocable 
terms of their government's written approval assuring that they 
will continue the supply, support and in-country production 
commitment during the time of hostilities. 
  Prime Minister further directed that the selection of 
equipment must be left to the professionals.

  [Text] French Defense Minister Francois Leotard has said 
his country fully supports the resolution of the Kashmir 
conflict in accordance with the UN resolutions. The support was 
conveyed by the French defense minister during a meeting with 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Islamabad yesterday. He 
expressed concern over the situation in occupied Kashmir. He 
was also concerned at the situation in Afghanistan and expressed 
his country's support for Pakistan efforts to bring about peace 
there. The prime minister briefed Leotard on the situation in 
occupied Kashmir, especially grave human rights violations by 
Indian forces there. Benazir Bhutto also apprised him about the 
Pakistan-India secretary-level talks and said that despite 
Pakistan's best efforts, India did not play its part for the 
normalization of the situation. The prime minister invited the 
French industrialists and entrepreneurs to visit Pakistan to 
explore the possibility of investment and joint ventures. 
Leotard told the prime minister that France wishes to establish 
close ties with Pakistan in all fields, including defense. 
  Leotard also called on Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali. The 
foreign minister expressed his satisfaction at the cooperation 
between France and Pakistan on defense issues. He apprised 
Leotard about the situation in Afghanistan and his recent visit 
to the Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and 
Kazakhstan. Noting the similarity of views between the two 
countries on various international issues, including Kashmir and 
Afghanistan, Leotard said he appreciated Pakistan's role in 
peacekeeping operations around the world.

  [Text] Pakistan and Saudi Arabia emphasized the need for an 
unconditional cease-fire and cessation of all hostilities in 
Afghanistan. In a joint communique issued in Riyadh and 
Islamabad simultaneously, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and Sardar 
Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari urged the Afghan leaders to sincerely 
implement the accord reached in Islamabad, which was 
authenticated at holy Mecca, as well as the Jalalabad agreement. 
They urged all the Afghan leaders to cooperate with the Islamic 
Conference Organization and its secretary general for ensuring 
and monitoring a permanent cease-fire as envisaged in the Mecca 
Accord. Expressing grave concern at the happenings in 
Afghanistan, King Fahd and President Leghari said the situation 
has become all the more tragic and a cause of concern as the 
Afghan leaders had expressed their firm determination to work 
for peace.

  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Leghari has said that 
Pakistan has no intention of interfering in Afghanistan's 
internal affairs, but it is ready to play a role for peace there 
with the consent of the Afghan leaders. He was talking to the 
Afghan president's special emissary, Engineer Ahmad Shah 
Ahmedzai, who apprised the president about the latest situation 
in Afghanistan. 
  Expressing deep concern at the present crisis in 
Afghanistan, 
Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that the entire Islamic 
world, including Pakistan, is anguished at the outbreak of 
fighting in Afghanistan. He said that is why he and Prime 
Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto have appealed to all the Afghan 
groups to observe a cease-fire to provide an opportunity to 
friendly countries to forge an agreement between the rival 
groups. The president urged the Afghan leaders to adopt the 
path of dialogue to end their differences peacefully for the 
sake of preserving Afghanistan's territorial integrity. 
  Reports say fighting resumed in the Afghan capital Kabul 
this 
morning after an overnight lull. A spokesman of Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar has reported further aerial attacks and 
artillery shelling.

  [Text] Islamabad (PPI) -- A Foreign Office spokesman said 
here on Monday that the Pakistan-Afghanistan border has not been 
closed and it is open for those Afghan nationals, who are 
traveling on valid visas. Those people who want to come without 
any visa, however, will not be allowed to enter Pakistan. The 
spokesman added that seriously wounded persons have been allowed 
to enter Pakistan even without visas or other relevant documents. 
  The spokesman said Pakistan is cooperating with UN relief 
agencies to supply food and other relief materials to Afghan 
refugees in Jalalabad, and a big convoy carrying food and other 
materials will leave for Jalalabad on Tuesday. He disclosed 
that Pakistan will set up a hospital camp at Jalalabad to 
provide medical aid to those wounded in the battle. He added 
that Pakistan is providing every possible assistance to the 
Afghan refugees in Jalalabad. 
  The spokesman said that fighting is taking place only in 
Kabul; other areas are peaceful and, hence, the people wounded 
in Kabul can be moved to other areas for medical treatment. 
There is, therefore, no justification for opening the Pakistani 
border for Afghan nationals trying to enter the country without 
any visa. He said Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan has met 
the UN representative on Afghanistan and assured him of 
Pakistan's help in providing aid to Afghanistan. The foreign 
secretary has also met the high commissioner for Afghan refugees 
in this regard.

  [Sukenik] But President Clinton himself said that President 
al-Asad spoke about normalization with Israel. 
  [Rabin] But it was Clinton who said that, I have to hear it 
also from al-Asad. 
  [Sukenik] The new factor is that normalization was mentioned 
for the first time in the Syrian context. 
  [Rabin] Normalization has been referred to by the Syrians in 
the past. The problem is how it fits into the concept of peace, 
what the timetable to achieve peace is, and what price Israel 
has to pay.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at the </F>
Jerusalem Ramada Hotel by Shlomo Raz on 16 January -- recorded 
"a short time ago"] 
  [Text] [Peres] What we can learn from the Geneva news 
conference is that we still have a lot to learn. In other 
words, we still do not have all the details, which we will 
receive from the U.S. peace team. The overall terminology was 
okay, the detailed terminology has still not been uttered. It 
is still too early to draw conclusions. It is clear that 
President Clinton made a supreme effort to advance the peace 
process, for which we admire him. We are ready to resume the 
peace talks between the heads of delegations at the end of the 
month as planned, but to what extent the general terminology is 
translated into practice, we will know -- at the earliest -- 
tomorrow, and even that is not definite. 
  [Raz] But can we refer to satisfaction, temperate 
satisfaction, or disappointment that President al-Asad did not 
go into more detail on normalization? 
  [Peres] The tone was too positive to be disappointing, it 
was too general to arouse satisfaction. At this stage, we know 
some of the things -- we know the overall tone -- we do not know 
the details, and there is no point in guessing. 
  [Raz] In your meeting tomorrow with the two U.S. emissaries 
-- Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk -- will you have to provide the 
Americans with answers concerning the news conference? 
  [Peres] Our answers are ready today. We say that in return 
for full peace, including diplomatic relations, open borders -- 
not only normalization because that is a general word, we have 
to know what lies behind normal relations -- discussions on 
security arrangements, an understanding on Lebanon, and the 
proper conduct of the negotiations, our answer is affirmative.

<F P=106> [Report by Jack Katzenell -- recorded] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Katzenell] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said 
Israel would have to analyze very carefully all the information 
which he had just received from the head of the U.S. peace team, 
Dennis Ross, about the Clinton-al-Asad summit. Peres made it 
clear that not all his doubts about al-Asad's intentions had 
been dispelled, and Israel would have to investigate the 
significance of al-Asad's public statements in direct 
negotiations with Syria. Nevertheless, Peres agreed with Ross 
and with President Clinton that there are grounds for 
encouragement in al-Asad's statement. 
  [Peres] Basically, we are very glad that the negotiations 
with the Syrians will be renewed on the level of the head of the 
missions by the end of the month, and that there is a feeling of 
a more promising air that was created in the meeting between the 
President of the United States and the president of Syria.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F>
Beilin by Mikha'el Tuchfeld -- live] 
  [Text] [Tuchfeld] Mr. Beilin, do the pronouncements heard 
at the joint news conference by Presidents Clinton and al-Asad, 
in which the latter spoke about normal relations, meet Israel's 
expectations? 
  [Beilin] I think we must wait for a detailed report about 
the lengthy meeting held by the two men which we are due to get 
either tonight or tomorrow morning. The pronouncements made at 
the news conference were important, but they are not what we 
would like to hear from President al-Asad himself. Had the 
latter said what President Clinton said we would definitely feel 
more comfortable. It is important to ascertain whether President 
al-Asad's is fully committed. The commitment in principle to 
arrive at a comprehensive peace and to work toward normalization 
are important, and I would not want to play them down in any 
way. The feeling would seem to be that we have taken a step 
forward, although we are still far from clarity. 
  [Tuchfeld] Does the fact that the two presidents issued 
separate statements rather than a joint one strengthen what you 
say; namely, that we heard the pronouncements from Clinton 
rather than from al-Asad? 
  [Beilin] Maybe. I do not know whether they had planned to 
come out with a joint statement, but the fact remains that they 
issued separate statements. Of course, both statements 
contained positive elements. Some things, which cannot be 
dismissed out of hand, were left unsaid. However, as I said 
before, we should wait for a full report and regard this news 
conference as an element of progress in a long process which may 
now be shortened. 
  [Tuchfeld] Is the opening of a U.S.-Syrian channel of 
communications good or detrimental for Israel? 
  [Beilin] It is not detrimental for Israel. I think it is 
part of an overall structure containing a three-way and a 
two-way dialogue between us and the Syrians and between the 
Syrians and the Americans. I see it as part of overall 
progress, and not as something having an adverse effect on us. 
  [Tuchfeld] But we did not hear even one word on the question 
of terror. Syria is considered a terror-supporting country, but 
we heard no mention of the subject in the news conference. 
  [Beilin] I suppose many things were said behind closed doors 
and were not repeated at the news conference. We must wait a 
few more hours to better understand what happened in the closed 
rooms. 
  [Tuchfeld] Finally, I cannot help asking you about Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's criticism today. He said your remarks 
last week about the future of the Golan and that settlements 
should not have been established there were thoughtless. 
  [Beilin] Perhaps you cannot help asking me, but I am 
entitled not to answer you. 
  [Tuchfeld] Mr. Beilin, thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by </F>
Ya'el Dan, Itay Engel, and Udi Segal -- live] 
  [Text] [Dan] We have the first reaction by a cabinet 
minister to Syrian President al-Asad's remarks. You heard what 
President al-Asad had to say at the Geneva news conference. Are 
you satisfied or disappointed? 
  [Sarid] First, I think we have to wait to hear more about 
what took place at the Clinton-al-Asad summit meeting. What we 
know so far is what is public knowledge. We all know that 
President Clinton's emissaries -- Dennis Ross and his colleagues 
-- will arrive in Jerusalem tonight. We will receive details 
from them, and sometimes the details are more important than 
what we hear at a news conference. On the other hand, the 
initial reports or signals we received from the news conference 
are encouraging. I think we heard things we have never heard 
before: First, we heard a Syrian readiness for full peace with 
Israel, and even more important -- according to the U.S. 
President's testimony -- al-Asad has made a commitment to 
normalize relations with Israel. I think that is something we 
very much wanted to hear, and now we have heard it. 
  [Dan] Did we hear al-Asad's definition of the substance of 
peace, as we have been waiting to hear? 
  [Sarid] Full peace is a good term. Of course, when full 
peace is mentioned we still have to see what it means. I assume 
that in a meeting between two presidents lasting three or four 
hours they did not make do with such a general term. I believe 
that underlines even more what I said previously, that we have 
to hear the details of the meeting and then analyze them. I 
believe that based on what we heard from the Syrian president, 
and even more so from the U.S. President, it is obvious that it 
was not a disappointing meeting. Quite the contrary. I have 
already mentioned full peace and a commitment to normalization 
of relations with Israel. There is one sentence, which to me 
appears very important: Syria regards full peace a strategic 
option. From that we learn that it is not merely a Syrian 
tactical move. We must compare that to the situation which 
existed only two or three years ago. At that time, when Syria 
referred to strategic considerations, it referred to strategic 
parity with Israel, which meant another confrontation with 
Israel. Now the strategic aim is peace. I believe that when we 
study the two concepts we are witness to the huge distance we 
have covered in the last two to three years in the geopolitical 
and geostrategic situation in the Middle East. 
  [Engel] You therefore sound optimistic after hearing what 
was said in Geneva. 
  [Sarid] I am definitely optimistic. 
  [Segal] Minister Sarid, what does that mean for Israel? The 
ball is now in your court, you will have to make the difficult 
decisions. 
  [Sarid] The ball has still not crossed into anybody's court. 
It is in both the Syrian and Israeli courts. I definitely agree 
with President Clinton's term that both sides will have to make 
tough decisions. I called those decisions the most important 
and difficult decisions any Israeli Government has made since 
the establishment of the state. I believe that the decisions 
facing the Syrian regime are no less tough. If we want peace, 
then both sides will have to make those decisions soon. 
  [Dan] Let us put it all in a very concrete context. When 
the Israeli and Syrian delegations meet in Washington next week 
will they begin from a better starting point? 
  [Sarid] I believe so. Since we heard the remarks from the 
horse's mouth, then I assume that the envoys will act 
accordingly.

<F P=106> [Interview with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu by Hayim </F>
Yavin -- live in the studio] 
  [Excerpts] [Yavin] What is your reaction to the summit 
meeting between Clinton and al-Asad? 
  [Netanyahu] We all want to attain real peace with Syria, a 
peace that contains security, and we started this process in 
Madrid. However, beyond the words that were said by al-Asad 
today, I must point to those that were not said. Assuming that 
those words are squeezed out of him in the next meeting, just as 
the words normalization and peace were squeezed out of 'Arafat, 
the question is what kind of peace it will be. What I know is 
that the prime minister visited the Golan Heights 12 hours 
before the elections, and said there must be no withdrawal from 
the Golan. He said that anybody withdrawing from the Golan 
would be abandoning security. I know, and I believe most 
Israelis know, that the intention of this government is to give 
the entire Golan Heights to al-Asad, to step down from the Golan 
Heights. That will not bring peace. 
  All that remains to be seen now is not what Israel will 
give, 
since that as already been said: The depth of withdrawal will 
be tantamount to the depth of peace. If peace is interpreted as 
a mere piece of paper that Hafiz al-Asad has to give us, a peace 
agreement with two embassies and temporarily open borders -- the 
next day he may close them again and tear the paper to pieces, 
as has happened so many times among Arabs. Therefore, it is as 
simple as this: There can be peace only if we stay on the Golan. 
Peace without the Golan will not be peace. I am telling you: 
We will oppose it most vigorously and, I believe, with the full 
support of most Israelis. [passage omitted] 
  [Yavin] Sir, what do you propose to tell the U.S. envoys, 
President Clinton, and Secretary Christopher when they tell us: 
Al- Asad has taken a step forward. What would be your 
contribution? 
  [Netanyahu] I would tell them plain and simple: Syria 
attacked Israel from the Golan Heights, and the aggressor has no 
right whatsoever to demand back the area from which it attacked 
us. I would tell Hafiz al-Asad: You demand the entire Golan? 
I, too, demand the entire Golan. 
  I would tell the Americans: Al-Asad wants other things. 
First of all, he wants peace with you, not with us, and he 
definitely wants the Golan back. He needs this peace to 
modernize his army, which has Soviet weapons and no spare parts; 
he wants money and technology; he wants to solve his water 
problems because of the dam the Turks have built on the 
Euphrates. 
  If he wants all these things, I would make our position 
regarding the Golan more rigid. However, this government is 
apparently incapable of doing that and does not know how to 
negotiate. 
  A peace whereby we withdraw from the Golan in exchange for a 
piece of paper and embassies is no peace. During the seven-year 
war in which 1 million people were killed, Iran and Iraq held 
embassies in each other's country. 
  Therefore, our demand is simple: If the government and the 
prime minister who declared that he would not withdraw from the 
Golan wants to renege on his promise to the voter, I demand that 
he go back to the voter now and call new elections, before he 
concocts the details with Clinton and al-Asad. 
  [Yavin] Mr. Netanyahu, thank you very much.

  [Editorial Report] On 17 January, several Israeli Hebrew 
dailies carry additional reactions to the Geneva summit by 
members of the coalition, the opposition, and the Golan settlers. 
  A pool report on page 2 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT cites 
several members of the coalition. Construction and Housing 
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer says: "Al-Asad spoke about peace 
of the brave, but did not speak of security, settlements, or 
withdrawal. He bypassed all the road mines. I am very pleased, 
though I am missing a few answers." Knesset Member [MK] Avraham 
Poraz (Meretz) says: "We must not accept full withdrawal from 
the Golan, not even for full peace with Syria. Sovereignty may 
be handed over to Syria, but Israel has the right to protect its 
settlements." Minister Shim'on Shetrit is cited as saying: "The 
many expectations we had pinned on the Clinton-al-Asad meeting 
were not met, but the process made progress." 
  A report by Pe'erli Shahar on pages 1 and 8 of Tel Aviv 'AL 
HAMISHMAR says that "Minister Ya'ir Tzaban yesterday said in 
response that his impression of the Geneva summit is that a real 
chance has been opened for a breakthrough that could change the 
entire Middle East. `It is reasonable to assume that the prime 
minister's formula, according to which the depth of withdrawal 
will equal the depth of peace, will soon stand the real test. 
Israel has a single supreme interest: That in the future, the 
Golan Heights never serve as a springboard for acts of 
aggression against Israel in general and the Galilee in 
particular. There is room for far reaching compromises on all 
the other issues.'" 
  A Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ page A4 report by Gid'on Alon and Yerah 
Tal carries reactions by opposition members. Likud MK David 
Levi, former foreign minister, stated "Israel has maneuvered 
itself into a position in which the United States now 
coordinates its moves with Syria." According to him, this is a 
renewed recognition of Syria without it stopping its support for 
terrorists. Levi further says that "the coordination between 
the United States and Syria is not healthy for Israel." He 
adds: "Now, it will be almost impossible to prevent a 
U.S.-Syrian understanding about Israel's withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights." 
  MK Moshe Qatzav, Likud Knesset faction chairman, says that 
President Clinton has turned al-Asad into "a key figure for 
making a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. According to 
him, from now on, Syria will have a right to veto peace 
arrangements with other Arab countries, without a single Syrian 
concession toward peace." 
  The HA'ARETZ report also carries a reaction by the National 
Religious Party which says that "the government has created a 
situation in which foreign presidents determine the future of 
the state." Moledet Movement Chairman Rehav'am Ze'evi is cited 
as saying that "we do not need the ruler from across the ocean 
to manage our peace process." He adds that all al-Asad wants is 
to receive the Golan Heights back, and hopes that the government 
would sober up before we encounter hardships. 
  A report by Shim'on Weiss and ITIM on page 2 of Tel Aviv 
DAVAR says that "Golan settlers reacted with satisfaction to 
what they termed `al-Asad's tough statements in Geneva.'" A 
statement they issued after the summit says: "Al-Asad's 
uncompromising statements shattered the illusion that an Israeli 
willingness to make concessions on the Golan will cause a 
moderation of the Syrian stands." The Golan settlers call on 
the government to adopt a policy which represents the "broad 
consensus among the Israeli public -- a policy of peace with the 
Golan."

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz from the Prime </F>
Minister's Office -- live] 
  [Excerpts] The prime minister, the chief of staff, his 
deputy, the coordinator of government activities in the 
territories, and other senior defense officials, are meeting 
with the U.S. team led by Dennis Ross. The details of 
withdrawal will be addressed in Washington next week, when the 
parties start discussing the fine print. [passage omitted] 
  According to his meeting with al-Asad, President Clinton 
attributes much importance to holding the peace process in 
public -- because Israel's political structure is democratic. 
Clinton and the Americans believe it is important that the 
process is not held in back rooms, except of course for tactical 
issues and fine print matters. They want a public Syrian 
commitment to the peace process. They believe that yesterday, 
al-Asad made a giant step forward in this respect. 
  Bilateral U.S.-Syrian issues were also broached by the two 
ministers yesterday. The most difficult of those issues is 
terror. President Clinton brought up the issue, and noted the 
fact that the rejectionist front organizations are located in 
Damascus. He heard al-Asad saying something like: What can I 
do about George Habash? I cannot dispel him. 
  Israeli officials discerned a degree of urgency by the 
Syrian 
president, conveyed by the U.S. team. Al-Asad feels there is 
not much time and that peace should be completed before the end 
of 1994. These are the main points the Americans brought from 
the meeting President Clinton held with President al-Asad in 
Geneva. [passage omitted] 
  This morning, Shim'on Peres, Yosi Beilin, Uri Savir, and 
other senior Foreign Ministry officials met with the U.S. peace 
team, headed by Dennis Ross. Their message was not startling: 
The delegation heads will meet next week. Let us hear Foreign 
Minister Peres: 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] Concerning the negotiations, we 
have concrete results: The heads of the two delegations will 
meet on 24 January. Negotiations with Syria will resume. 
  [Raz] After what you heard this morning, are you satisfied 
with al-Asad remarks? 
  [Peres] I still believe that the details and the meanings 
will have to be clarified in the negotiations. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The meeting with the U.S. peace team ended at noon 
at the prime minister's bureau, and was followed by a 
tete-a-tete session between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Dennis Ross, head of the U.S. team. The earlier meeting was 
attended by the chief of staff, his deputy, and the Army chief 
of intelligence, as well as Elyaqim Rubinstein, Ambassador 
Itamar Rabinovich, and Uri Lubrani, the heads of the delegation 
to the negotiations in Washington. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the 
Israeli participants posed numerous questions to the U.S. team 
about the Americans' interpretation of President al-Asad's 
remarks in his talks with President Clinton. The Americans are 
convinced that Syria is indeed prepared to reach full peace and 
normalization with Israel. The Israelis also asked for 
clarifications of the substance and price of peace and about the 
security arrangements with Syria.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read introduction followed by correspondent </F>
reports] 
  [Excerpts] We now move on to the reports U.S. envoy Dennis 
Ross brought to Jerusalem after the Clinton-al-Asad summit 
meeting. Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq met with Ross this evening 
and discussed the possibility of an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, including the possibility of 
a withdrawal in stages and the leasing of land. In the 
meantime, it has been learned that President al-Asad hinted to 
the U.S. President that he would not insist on mutual 
demilitarization. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen 
updates us: 
  The Americans know how to do things dramatically. The U.S. 
peace team arrived last night from Geneva and went straight to 
the prime minister's residence. The briefings continued this 
morning, first at the Foreign Ministry, and then again at the 
prime minister's bureau. Dennis Ross is reporting to Israel 
about a different al- Asad, one who promises personal assistance 
in gathering information on the MIA's and Ron Arad, and who says 
openly: I do not believe the Israelis, but I also understand 
when they do not believe me. 
  Four main points surfaced in Ross' report: Al-Asad is ready 
to enter into serious negotiations even before a Rabin 
declaration on a withdrawal from the Golan Heights. It has 
always been said that al-Asad is in no hurry, but he now 
believes that time is not in his favor and wants peace. Al-Asad 
is ready for full peace and normalization, but he will not say 
so publicly until Rabin says he will withdraw. Security issues 
were deliberately not discussed in Geneva, they are being left 
for the negotiations in Washington. Jerusalem says that Rabin is 
under pressure, since the American are expecting quick answers. 
The immediate solution is to keep low, something Shim'on Peres 
supports, but Yosi Beilin does not. 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] I still think that the details 
and the significance must be verified in negotiations. 
  [Beilin] I think that we are now in a different situation 
than we were in yesterday or the day before. It is some sort of 
new era in relations between Syria and us. There is no doubt 
that based on the U.S. reports, there is now a Syrian commitment 
on a level that did not exist in the past to make peace with 
Israel. [end recording] 
  Whichever way we look at it, the Golan Heights are on the 
negotiating table. [passage omitted] 
  Is the government serious about holding a referendum on the 
Golan Heights? Minister Hayim Ramon announced that the cabinet 
will vote against the National Religious Party's Knesset motion 
on Wednesday to make it mandatory to hold a referendum on the 
area's future. 
  Despite Deputy Minister Mordekhay Gur's remarks about a 
referendum, ministers believe that the prime minister will 
prefer early elections prior to an accord with Syria. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 17 January 
reports: "Cabinet ministers made it clear that Deputy Defense 
Minister Mordekhay Gur read out the announcement on a referendum 
from the Knesset podium using the exact words decided on at the 
prime minister's bureau this morning. The ministers told our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht that the announcement on a referendum 
was presented to the Knesset after consultations were held at 
the prime minister's bureau and the final wording had been 
approved by the prime minister. Minister Yosi Sarid earlier 
said that the Knesset announcement on a referendum did not have 
cabinet approval."] 
  Our party affairs correspondent Yaron Deqel reports on the 
political map prior to a possible agreement with Syria: 
  Yitzhaq Rabin did not come to the Knesset tonight to talk 
about the Golan Heights. Cabinet ministers say that the 
government can only lose by holding a referendum. Even if the 
government wins the referendum, the cabinet will continue to be 
based on the same tiny majority in the Knesset. [passage 
omitted] 
  How will the political parties respond to an agreement which 
includes a withdrawal? The right wing will definitely be 
opposed, but the Likud was taken by surprise when three of its 
Knesset members abstained in the vote recognizing the PLO. The 
position of United Torah Jewry, which voted for the Camp David 
accords and against the PLO agreement, is unknown. Most of the 
SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] faction is opposed to 
withdrawal, but as usual it will decide at the last minute.

position enjoys the approval of the prime minister and the

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was today asked for 
clarifications about Deputy Defense Minister Gur's announcement, 
made on behalf of Rabin, regarding a referendum on the Golan 
Heights issue. Our correspondent Arye Schorr reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Schorr] The prime minister was asked 
today for his opinion regarding reservations expressed by Labor 
figures regarding a referendum and their preference for 
elections after an agreement with Syria is finalized. Mr. Rabin 
explained at length his decision -- taken following 
consultations with several of the ministers -- namely that if a 
peace agreement with Syria calls for a significant withdrawal, 
he will opt for a referendum. Mr. Rabin said that a significant 
withdrawal could involve the removal of settlements, and on this 
issue he would like to hear what the public has to say: 
  [Rabin] I am convinced that if and when we reach a draft 
peace agreement between Syria and Israel -- and this will demand 
a painful price from us, perhaps even more painful than the 
Israeli public expects -- if and when this happens, and if we 
want to be completely honest.... 
  [Schorr, interrupting] Rabin went on to say that we must ask 
the public whether it is willing to pay the price. The prime 
minister, answering a question, said that at this point -- and 
the emphasis was on this point -- there is no need for a proper 
government decision on the issue of referendum. He emphasized 
that there is no need to adopt new decisions. It is too early 
to draft a law in this issue in the Knesset: 
  [Rabin] I believe that there will be a government majority 
for this. In any case we will need to draft a law in the 
Knesset, but there is no point in doing so now, because at this 
stage we have nothing concrete to submit to the public. We will 
do so when and if there is something to present to the public. 
  On the Palestinian track we are not dealing with a 
territorial concession; there is no danger for uprooting 
settlements there. The government has received a clear and 
unequivocal mandate in this sphere. We expressed a willingness 
for territorial compromise on the Golan Heights, but nothing 
beyond this. 
  [Schorr] Today Rabin gave his first public reaction to the 
position adopted by al-Asad in the Geneva summit. He said this 
is not the time to hand out compliments: 
  [Rabin] I am not going to hand out grades to anybody. 
Although I expected more, for the purposes of continuing the 
negotiations I am willing to settle for what was publicly said 
and with what we were briefed on, although not publicly said. 
  [Schorr] Mr. Rabin hinted that there are elements in 
al-Asad's position which were not expressed in his speech, but 
about which the Americans briefed Israel. This is the next 
issue on the public and media agenda: What was really said in 
the private meeting between Clinton and al-Asad. [end recording] 
  To sum up: At this stage there is nothing to submit to the 
public for a referendum, because we have still not reached the 
stage of territorial concessions and uprooting settlements. 
This was what the prime minister said today at Jerusalem's King 
David Hotel.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
decided to announce his proposal to hold a referendum on a 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights following consultations he 
held in his office yesterday at the end of his session with the 
U.S. peace team. Prior to issuing the announcement, Rabin 
conferred separately with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur 
and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  Peres believes the government should retain both options: 
holding a referendum or calling an election once an agreement 
has been reached. In his opinion, no decision is called for at 
this point, but the appropriate option should be chosen at the 
right time. 
  The prime minister does not plan to submit the proposal to 
the cabinet for approval any time soon, and will only do so when 
the time comes to make a decision. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Minister Yosi Sarid said in response to remarks by 
Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur that there is no 
government position that asserts that a referendum has to be 
held prior to an actual withdrawal on the Golan Heights. Our 
correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that according to Minister 
Sarid's announcement, the issue has never come up in the cabinet 
and no decision has ever been made. Minister Sarid said it would 
be appropriate for elections to be held after an accord with 
Syria is initialed. He believes that the government can win a 
solid majority in these elections since the peace and security 
package which will be presented to the public will be most 
convincing. 
  Deputy Minister Gur said that the government would call for 
a 
referendum if called to make important concessions on the Golan 
Heights. In a Knesset debate on the future of the plateau, 
Deputy Minister Gur said that his remarks have the approval of 
the prime minister and the entire cabinet. He also said that 
Israel learned after the Clinton-al-Asad summit meeting that 
Syria insists on receiving the entire Golan Heights in return 
for peace. He noted that in the negotiations with Syria, we 
will insist on all the security components based on our concepts. 
  The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs 
opposes the motion by Likud Knesset Member Zakhi Hanegbi to hold 
elections prior to the signing of a peace accord which includes 
giving up any territory or which mentions the setting up of a 
Palestinian self- government in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza 
Strip. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the 
ministerial committee opposes the motion on the grounds that it 
refers to a clear-cut political issue.

  [Text] Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili opposes a 
referendum on the Golan Heights. Mr. Zvili told our party 
affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal that it makes no sense for the 
Labor Party to stop the political process in order to hold a 
referendum. According to Zvili no discussion on this issue has 
been held in Labor, and no decision on this issue was adopted by 
the party or government. The only basis for holding such a 
referendum is the coalition agreement with SHAS [Torah Observing 
Sephardim]. 
  Ministers Hayim Ramon and Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer also 
expressed reservations about the idea. Minister Ramon said that 
elections are preferable. Minister Ben-Eli'ezer says a 
referendum opens the door for a new system which could undermine 
democracy. According to Ben- Eli'ezer the government was 
elected for a period of four years after declaring its 
intentions. There is no need for a referendum, because the 
public might react emotionally rather than logically. 
  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Likud, 
Meretz, 
Tzomet, and Darawshah's Arab Democratic Party announced they 
oppose a referendum on the Golan Heights. Our correspondent 
notes that a Knesset decision is required for holding a 
referendum, and so far it looks as though such a decision is not 
assured of a majority.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Moti Bassok: "A Shot Aimed at Three </F>
Directions"] 
  [Text] Just when the U.S. peace delegation in Israel was 
trying to convince the top security echelon and the general 
public that the new al-Asad is interested in real peace, the 
prime minister yesterday surprised the political establishment 
with his suggestion to hold a referendum. 
  Rabin's initiative is directed at three targets: Hafiz 
al-Asad, the United States, and Israeli public opinion. The 
message to al-Asad is simple: We heard from the Americans that 
you are under pressure and would like to achieve peace this 
year. If this is so, you had better moderate your demands, 
otherwise we will have to appeal to Israeli public opinion, 
which would lengthen the process. The Americans told us you are 
familiar with the Israeli political scene. You are certainly 
aware of the massive opposition among the Israeli public to any 
concession on the Golan Heights, and certainly to the total 
concession you are demanding. 
  The message to the U.S. president and secretary of state is 
unequivocal: The Sinai withdrawal precedent, UN Resolutions 242 
and 338, and mainly the tough Syrian position, could force 
Israel to concede the entire Golan Heights contrary to vital 
security interests. This is a difficult, exceptional, 
sensitive, and complicated issue. Such an issue obliges every 
prime minister in any democracy to seek the public's opinion. 
The public could give Syria a negative answer. If you -- like 
us -- fear such an answer, you can make good use of your direct 
channel to al-Asad. 
  Rabin's message to the Israeli public is this: I understand 
you and will try to get the best deal for you. Let me work 
quietly; stop demonstrating. I got your message. We will try 
to get the best possible peace agreement, but eventually we will 
leave the decision in your hands.

  [Excerpts] Protest vigils are being held this evening at 
dozens of junctions throughout the country under the slogan: 
The people are united on the Golan. Our correspondent Nitzan 
Hen reports that several dozen settlers demonstrated this 
afternoon opposite the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, calling on the 
U.S. Administration to stop pressuring Israel. The 
demonstrators drove in a slow motorcade on Hayarqon Street, and 
chanted slogans denouncing Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin's 
remarks that the settlers may live under Syrian rule in the 
framework of a peace agreement. We will never agree to live 
under foreign sovereignty, the settlers said, calling on Rabin 
to fire Beilin at once. 
  Another protest was held outside Rabin's residence in 
Jerusalem. Students demonstrated against a withdrawal from the 
Golan, demanding that the government call an election before 
making any territorial concession on the Golan. 
  There is nothing new in al-Asad's remarks -- this was the 
reaction of the Golan settlers to the announcements by Clinton 
and al-Asad in Geneva. The settlers staged demonstrations today 
and blocked the main road to the Golan Heights. [passage 
omitted] 
  Dozens of kibbutz members in the Jordan Valley held a 
demonstration at the Tzemah junction, one of 60 demonstrations 
taking place tonight at junctions throughout the country in 
support of the Golan settlers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A lot of impressive work has been invested in the 
campaign to show that the national consensus supports the Golan 
Heights as an inseparable part of Israel. However, beyond the 
car stickers saying: "The people are united on the Golan," what 
do the residents of the plateau think about their future? The 
poll we held among the settlers was conducted by Haifa 
University's Statistics Department under the scientific 
supervision of Dr. Avner Halevi, an internationally renowned 
expert. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling sums up the 
poll's results: 
  Question: Do you think we can reach with the Syrians an 
agreement which contains less than a full withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights? Fifty-one percent of Golan residents do not 
believe we can. 
  Question: Do you think that within five years there will be 
a peace accord which includes a withdrawal? Fifty-five percent 
believe that within five years there will be such an agreement 
which includes some withdrawal. Twenty-four percent do not 
believe there will be such an agreement. 
  Question: Would you be prepared to live on the Golan Heights 
under Syrian sovereignty? Seven-and-a-half percent are ready to 
live on the Golan Heights under Syrian sovereignty, 85.5 percent 
are not prepared to do so, although even among them there are 
those who believe that there will be a withdrawal in the long 
run. 
  Question: Did you discuss the option of leaving the Golan 
within your family circle? Fifty-two percent did discuss the 
option with their family and that includes religious 
inhabitants, kibbutz members, and people living in the town of 
Qatzrin. Among these people, 11 percent have already made a 
move in that direction, such as looking for other jobs and 
alternative housing, and the possibility of receiving financial 
compensation. 
  Question: Would you be prepared to leave the Golan Heights 
now in return for adequate compensation? Some 12 percent are 
prepared to leave now in return for appropriate compensation. 
An interesting point is that all those who responded positively 
on that came from kibbutzim or live in Qatzrin. Not a single 
resident of the moshavim are ready to leave in return for 
compensation. 
  Question: What compensation do you think appropriate? Among 
those ready to evacuate, some 35 percent mentioned between 
$100,000 and $300,000. Some 60 percent are not prepared to 
quote the amount they would accept. 
  The next question is general: Do you support the peace 
process with the PLO on an autonomy for Judaea, Samaria, and the 
Gaza Strip? Golan residents are equally divided between 
supporters and opponents of the agreement with the PLO: 46.3 
percent both for and against. Compared to previous polls, it 
appears that for the majority there is no obvious link between 
their views on the Golan Heights and their positions on the 
Palestinian autonomy. They support the autonomy in other areas, 
but oppose leaving the Golan Heights. 
  The last question: How did you vote in the last elections 
and would you vote the same way today? Fifty percent of Labor 
voters would vote the same way again, 27 percent would not vote 
Labor, and the others are undecided. Among those who voted for 
right-wing parties -- Likud, Tzomet, the National Religious 
Party -- 60 to 70 percent would vote for them again. Among 
Meretz voters, 30 percent said openly that they would not vote 
for it again, 40 percent would recast their vote for it, and 30 
percent are undecided. 
  The telephone poll was conducted among 250 households on the 
Golan Heights based on a representative sample.

<F P=106> [Report by Nehama Doweq] </F>
  [Text] A majority of the Israeli public supports the 
establishment of a Palestinian state with clear and agreed-upon 
borders. Among Labor voters, there is a majority for abandoning 
settlements in Judaea and Samaria in return for a peace 
agreement. These two facts emerge from a public opinion poll by 
the research institute of Hanokh and Rafi Smith conducted for 
Labor. 
  The poll results show that 47 percent of the Israeli public 
support the establishment of a Palestinian state, while 40 
percent oppose this and 13 percent abstain. Among Likud 
supporters, 38 percent favor of the idea, and 54 percent oppose 
it. 
  Distribution of stands among Labor supporters is as follows: 
67 percent are for the establishment of a Palestinian state; and 
23 percent are against. After studying the data, the 
researchers conclude that Likud supporters will agree to the 
establishment of a Palestinian state, provided it has 
agreed-upon and clear borders. 
  The poll reveals a surprising fact regarding the readiness 
to 
leave settlements under foreign sovereignty in Judaea and 
Samaria -- there is only a 6-percent gap between the stands: 40 
percent accept this, while 46 percent oppose. 
  In this case too, there is a different distribution of 
stands 
between Labor and Likud supporters: 65 percent of the Likud 
supporters oppose the idea, while 70 percent of the Labor voters 
are willing to accept it. 
  The poll, conducted at the end of December among a 
representative sample of the Jewish population in Israel, also 
shows that only 30 percent want to end the talks with the PLO at 
once, while 51 percent want to see the process proceed, though 
cautiously. 
  Some 33 percent have a positive view of and no reservations 
about the Oslo agreement, while 21 percent believe that although 
the agreement is good, it will not bring peace. 
  Most of those polled, both Labor and Likud supporters, 
believe that the key is quiet borders. An autonomy agreement 
that would secure quiet borders is supported by 60 percent of 
the Likud voters and by 99 percent of Labor voters. At the same 
time, if terrorists continue murdering Jews after an agreement 
is signed, 70 percent will regard this a failure. There was no 
difference between Labor and Likud voters' stands on this issue. 
The agreement will also be perceived as a failure if, after the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] pull out of the Gaza Strip, the PLO 
fails to seize control. 
  The authors of the poll state in conclusion: Some 60 percent 
of the public support a cautious promotion of the peace process; 
the public is very sensitive to murderous terror attacks, and 
will not regard a peace agreement while terror continues a 
success; the public is split in its stands regarding the 
establishment of a Palestinian state and the evacuation of 
settlements. 
  The Labor public relations department closely examined the 
poll results, and plans the party's updated public relations 
campaign strategy in accordance with the findings. It is clear 
to Labor officials that the guideline should be the claim that 
peace will bring security. The Labor campaigners are also clear 
that the fact that military men are in charge of the 
negotiations should be stressed to the public, hence -- the IDF 
will be able to defend the peace agreement and the borders it 
entails.

  [Excerpts] The Cabinet met this morning under Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa briefed 
the Cabinet on the peace process and the contacts made on the 
matter. Musa described the summit between U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad as a new sign in the 
peace process, noting that the summit was successful by any 
standard. Musa referred to the telephone call between 
Presidents Clinton and Mubarak on the issue. He reviewed the 
impact of the summit on relations between Syria and the United 
States and on the Lebanese-Israeli peace talks, adding that this 
could lead to a just peace on the basis of land for peace. The 
foreign minister's report referred to the Palestinian-Israeli 
track and the results reached by the two sides during their 
ongoing meetings regarding the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. The report also referred to the 
agreement between Jordan and the PLO. 
  Musa noted that there is an Egyptian-Palestinian draft 
agreement to set up joint projects and open branches of Egyptian 
banks in Gaza and Jericho. He pointed out that the draft 
agreement is expected to be signed in Cairo soon. 
  Turning to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the foreign 
minister referred to the partition plan and the position of the 
parties to the conflict on this plan. He noted that NATO is 
ready to use force to implement the partition agreement under 
the supervision of the Security Council. [passage omitted] 
  The Cabinet then reviewed a report by Interior Minister 
Hasan 
al- Alfi in which he discussed the internal security situation 
and the Interior Ministry's efforts on this matter. Al-Alfi 
pointed out that the ministry is following a plan based on a 
clear-cut security strategy. Noting that confronting extremism 
remains a key security element, the interior minister pointed 
out that improved methods have been recently introduced. More 
extensive security operations against dens of extremism have 
been mounted, particularly in shantytowns, Upper Egypt, and some 
other governorates. Coordination between state security and 
public security agencies has been stepped up to pursue and 
swiftly arrest fugitives. 
  The minister noted that the list of suspects at airports, 
ports, and other points of entry and exit has been widened and 
extra measures have been taken to confront leading extremists 
with a view to isolating them and cutting off their contacts 
with their cadres. In addition, any signs of agitation or 
escalation by extremists are being dealt with firmly and their 
schemes among the masses are being frustrated. The minister 
pointed out that plans by the military wing of the terrorist 
organizations have been aborted, their influential leaders have 
been arrested, and their dens stormed. He noted that his 
ministry is confronting some signs of corruption and deviation 
as part of the government's policy and in a bid to demonstrate 
the integrity of the regime. 
  The interior minister pointed out that security cooperation 
with some Arab countries in the areas of coordination and 
handing over fugitives is being upgraded. He reviewed his 
contacts during the Arab interior ministers' meeting in Tunis, 
adding that they have led to the arrest of some fugitives. He 
referred to the decline in the rate of seizure of unlicensed 
weapons, cases of drug trafficking, embezzlement, squandering of 
public wealth, and bribery. 
  During the meeting, the Cabinet approved a number of draft 
laws, including one regulating the use of foreign currency. The 
new bill lifts the current restrictions and procedures that are 
no longer compatible with the free exchange regulations in Egypt 
and allows travelers to take out foreign currency without any 
restrictions or documents. The Cabinet also approved a draft 
law organizing the cotton trade in the country. The bill seeks 
to liberalize the sale and purchase of cotton in accordance with 
the market economy and the principle of free trade. 
  The Cabinet also approved a draft law setting up a Cotton 
Exchange for spot transactions to be called the Mina al-Basal 
Exchange. Cotton will be sold and purchased through this 
exchange, which will be based in Alexandria. The Cabinet also 
approved a draft civil code that will remedy the loopholes that 
exist in the current law. Under the new law, automation will be 
introduced to prevent the forgery of identity cards and all 
relevant information for each citizen will be stored and given a 
computerized number. The Cabinet also approved a number of 
international agreements.

  [Text] Cairo, 18 Jan (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has 
said that the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva worries Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin: He has not responded to what the 
U.S. President himself declared after he was convinced by the 
Syrian president's stance. Rabin, as usual, tried to equivocate 
and sidestep statements by inventing arguments and excuses. 
This is especially evident in his statement that the Syrian 
pledge to normalize relations with Israel is not specific and 
that it needs to be explained and clarified. 
  The newspaper noted in a commentary that will be published 
tomorrow, Wednesday, the opinion of political observers that the 
Syrian-U.S. meeting affirmed to President Clinton the honesty of 
his Syrian counterpart's intentions and his true desire to 
participate in restoring real peace to the region. 
  The newspaper believes that Rabin's former stances throw 
some 
doubt on U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross' expectations that the 
Geneva summit has provided a new opportunity for peace efforts 
and that the talks will soon resume in a more flexible 
atmosphere.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Jan (MENA)--The areas of al-Ma'sarah, 
al-Huda, and Wadi Hawf in south Cairo were the scene of 
intensive security sweeps early this morning involving units 
from the State Intelligence Department, the Traffic Department, 
the Central Security Forces, and regular officers. The forces 
imposed a security cordon around the three areas while other 
forces carried out sweeps to arrest fugitive terrorist and 
criminal elements. 
  A police unit manning a highway roadblock arrested one 
terrorist and wounded another. Two more escaped. The four 
terrorists were riding in a pickup truck. Police fired on the 
truck after the four refused to stop at the roadblock. 
  The sweeps resulted in the arrest of 60 fugitive criminals. 
Two criminals were caught redhanded with a load of stolen iron 
in their car.

  [Text] Cairo, Jan 18--(MENA)--Terrorism is imperiling the 
security and stability not only of Egypt but of all the Arab 
countries as well, Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi said this 
evening. 
  Al-Alfi, at a meeting of the Shura (advisory) Council's 
Committee for Arab and Foreign Affairs and National Security, 
underlined that terrorists are a negligible minority and do not 
represent the Egyptian people and that the matter requires 
concerted efforts to confront such a danger. 
  Thousands of cassette tapes propagating destructive ideas 
were seized and hotbeds in which they recorded stormed, he said. 
  On exaggeration by some foreign news agencies of violent 
acts 
in Egypt, al-Alfi said he is keen on having everything made 
clear to the public without concealing facts. 
  These media organs are releasing mendacious reports to 
hasten 
a coverage without paying due attention to real conditions, he 
said. 
  During recent months, some 12,500 unlicenced arms were 
seized 
he specified. He said he is vehemently against random 
detention of citizens, specially women, without clear charges. 
  Authorities are conducting daily and surprise inspections of 
prisons which have full discipline, he added.

opposition newspaper AL-ITTIHAD AL-DUWALIYAH with a newscast 
free of charge after being instructed by the Egyptian Government 
to do so. 
  MENA says that this claim is not true. The news agency 
challenges anyone to prove that it is distributing its casts 
free of charge upon instruction from any side. Such a move goes 
against its policies and traditions as an independent media 
institution with a commercial base. Therefore, it does not 
provide any media services free whether to a Sudanese or 
non-Sudanese newspaper, or even to an Egyptian newspaper. 
  The news agency affirms to the Sudanese newspaper that 
published the report that the Sudanese opposition newspaper has 
no agreements with MENA to provide it with news reports. 
Therefore, the Sudanese newspaper's report is part of attempts 
to discredit Egyptian media. 
  MENA hopes that the Sudanese newspaper will confirm its 
reports before publishing them so that it will not lose its 
credibility.

<F P=106> [Report by Cairo correspondent Tula Mansour: "Juppe in the </F>
Fundamentalists' Stronghold" -- first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] Cairo -- Foreign Minister Alain Juppe started his 
official visit to Cairo with a private visit to Upper Egypt, for 
the sake of a bit of tourism. Indeed, this was a highly symbolic 
gesture because that region is the stronghold of the Islamic 
activists. 
  Since his arrival at the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Affairs 
Ministry], Alain Juppe had not had the opportunity to see the 
splendors of Egyptian archaeology... Would he visit Upper 
Egypt? Yes, he dared to do so to set a good example, reassure 
the tourists, but primarily to reassure the Egyptian population. 
Juppe had set aside two days in his timetable for a private 
visit: Luxor, Aswan, Sinai. It was a direct response to the 
Muslim fundamentalists. 
  Alain Juppe described Franco-Egyptian relations as 
"excellent." "The fundamentalist violence is not capable of 
affecting our bilateral relations. In 1993, the total value of 
commercial transactions between the two countries was more than 
6 billion French francs [Fr]. Every year, Fr460 million is 
granted in annual aid. France's financial contribution will not 
be suspended," the minister stated. 
  The attack on the Semiramis hotel, which took place on the 
eve of President Mubarak's visit to Paris last November, and the 
machine-gun attack on Austrian tourists at Christmas in downtown 
Cairo during Francois Mitterrand's semiprivate visit did not 
discourage Alain Juppe from visiting Egypt. The avowed 
objective of this visit was: "To plan a meeting of several 
foreign ministers from countries bordering on the Mediterranean 
to strengthen cooperation in the framework of the five-plus-five 
dialogue." This agreement was signed in 1990 among the southern 
European countries: France, Italy, Spain, Malta, and Portugal, 
and those of the Arab Maghreb. The work was suspended because of 
the conflict with Libya and is therefore now being revived with 
the choice of a new partner: Egypt. 
  According to Alain Juppe's spokesman, a summit will be held 
in June. It will be preceded by meetings of experts and 
intellectuals from the Mediterranean countries. Eyes will be 
turned toward Algeria, which must not be allowed to topple. All 
the neighboring countries would then be contaminated. The 
mistakes made in Algeria must be avoided with Egypt. There will 
therefore be no statements about indivisible democracy, but no 
anti-Islamic propaganda either... The language of moderation is 
being spoken. This is also the aim of Alain Juppe's visit. 
  Two ambitious projects are on the agenda: The increase in 
French-speaking courses in Egyptian universities and the 
creation of bilingual classes in high schools. The "Juppe plan" 
is to penetrate the middle classes, promote dual cultures, and 
create new youth movements capable of overcoming those who are 
preaching a closed society and a policy of isolation by the 
indigenous cultures.

<F P=106> [Report by Wa'il al-Ibrashi] </F>
  [Text] Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, official spokesman of the banned 
Muslim Brotherhood, has returned on the same flight that took 
him to Jordan after he was prevented by the Jordanian 
authorities at the airport from entering the country last 
Thursday in the first case of its kind experienced by 
al-Hudaybi, who has regularly visited Jordan for the past 20 
years. 
  Al-Hudaybi, who appeared moved by the sudden Jordanian 
decision, told ROSE AL-YUSUF: I was going to visit my physician 
daughter, who is married to a physician, lives in Jordan, and 
has Jordanian citizenship. I spoke to her on the telephone and 
told her: I am coming to visit you. I have been visiting her 
for the past 20 years. What happened! 
  [Al-Ibrashi] Was there a political, party, Muslim 
Brotherhood, or other conference or meeting? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Not at all. This was a family visit unrelated 
to any other activity. 
  [Al-Ibrashi] Did the Jordanian authorities give you any 
explanation for preventing you from entering the country? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] I asked them and they told me that you are 
banned from entering the country. I asked them why. They said: 
We are security people and carry out instructions. I tried to 
see the security director. I tried to talk to anyone. But they 
prevented me and did not want to listen. My daughter was 
waiting for me at the airport. I tried to see her, but they 
also prevented me. 
  Al-Hudaybi added: I have not recently said anything at all 
against Jordan. On the contrary. I have praised the democratic 
experiment in Jordan in the wake of the recent elections. The 
Muslim Brotherhood there is recognized and licensed. The party 
won 18 seats in the recent elections. I was only going to see 
my daughter. 
  Meanwhile, Jordanian diplomatic sources have told ROSE 
AL-YUSUF that the Jordanian authorities have adopted new 
measures regarding the entry of the leaders and members of 
fundamentalist groups. They said that they have no knowledge or 
explanation why al-Hudaybi was banned from entering Jordan and 
whether this ban is part of these measures or there are other 
reasons. 
  Jordan has recently arrested on arrival 15 Jordanians and 
Palestinians returning from Afghanistan. Before that, it 
arrested others and released some of them following the 
intervention of the Muslim Brotherhood there. Some are still 
being detained.

<F P=106> [Speech by National Defense Minister Lamine Zeroual to the </F>
nation; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Male and female citizens, I have the honor to address you today 
while the country is about to encounter a decisive stage in its 
history. The roots of the political crisis that is storming our 
country go back to the last few years. The crisis grew under 
the overall weakness of the state and its institutions, and it 
started to grow further and expand with the passing of time 
until it reached its peak in October 1988 when an explosion 
occurred. This exposed other sides of the crisis in the 
economic, social, and security spheres, and every opportunity 
became available to internal and external destructive elements 
to achieve dubious objectives based on the distortion of facts 
as a means of consolidating a feeling of failure and waste among 
deprived citizens. 
  The spread of selfishness, egocentricity, and the dominance 
of narrow partisan perceptions over wider national interests 
contributed to the further complication of the crisis. 
  After this brief review of the nature of the crisis, it may 
be useful to recall its major causes: 
  Political causes: 
  1. The weakness of the political system that provided the 
opportunity for parasitic [tufayli] political tendencies and 
groups with vested interests to reach many positions of 
responsibility in the economy, administration, and other 
sensitive state bodies; 
  2. Blatant contradictions between the programs and ideas of 
some parties, and their noncompliance with the terms of the 
Constitution, which clearly define the nation's ideals and its 
firmly-established values; 
  3. The prevalence of party over national affiliation in many 
parties and their narrow understanding of pluralism and 
democratic practice in their effort to attain power; 
  4. The wavering of public opinion and its lack of concern 
due 
to loss of confidence in the authorities as a result of the 
contradiction between the authorities' public declarations and 
actual practices, and as a result of dissatisfaction with the 
programs of many parties. 
  Economic causes: 
  1. The mismanagement of the economy; 
  2. The disruption in the manufacturing sectors in general as 
a result of the repeated restructuring that has become the main 
characteristic of management for many years; 
  3. The destructive squandering of the country's hard 
currency 
reserves and other financial resources through the use of 
demagogic slogans; 
  4. The use of short-term loans to cover the state's deficit 
caused by spending and consumption, a matter that has led to an 
increase in the servicing of foreign debts that were eating into 
three-quarters of the country's financial resources at the end 
of 1993; 
  5. The encouragement of the smuggling phenomenon through the 
opening of borders without providing the necessary measures for 
the protection of the national economy. 
  Social causes: 
  1. The rise in unemployment as a result of putting a brake 
on 
investment, development, and as a result of the continual 
shedding of manpower in organizations; 
  2. The state's abandonment of its social role, particularly 
in the field of housing and jobs to which attention had been 
paid in the last few years; 
  3. Infractions by some of the institutions of the 
administration in the form of widespread bureaucratic abuses: 
Graft, nepotism, and breaking the law in many cases; 
  4. The unequal sharing of national income. 
  All these causes have led to the aggravation and 
deterioration of the crisis and although matters have become 
more complex, it is quite possible to contain them and find 
suitable and gradual solutions to tackling them. 
  This requires, first of all, goodwill from all the sides and 
the concerted efforts of all the sincere patriots and upright 
citizens in all social strata, parties, societies, vocational 
groupings, factories, farms, schools, and universities in order 
to arrive at a political solution that responds to the 
aspirations of our people and that would match the greatness of 
Algeria and its historical revolution and its contemporary 
values. At the same time, they should show wisdom and a spirit 
of true patriotism and place the interest of the country above 
all considerations and adhere to the unchanging historic and 
spiritual values of the Algerian people, and discard for good 
all aspects of violence in political action. 
  Within this framework, the National People's Army has 
repeatedly given proof of its good intentions. Thus, its' full 
readiness to contribute in an effective manner to the search for 
a solution that might take the country out of the current 
political crisis and its' withdrawal from the political scene 
for the past five years are clear proof of its respect for the 
people's will following the adoption of the 1989 Constitution. 
The National People's Army's withdrawal from political life 
does not, however, mean that it will remain with its' hands tied 
when there are mistakes and serious abuses that have threatened 
and are still threatening the people's fate and the future of 
the nation as a whole. 
  I would also like to point out here that the Army's 
withdrawal from the political scene means, furthermore, that the 
military will not henceforth accept being an instrument of 
political struggle or anyone's ambitions. 
  This is a principled stance by the Army; there will be no 
moving away from it and nor should it be subjected to any 
trickery or manipulation. 
  On the other hand, the agreement of the Army to the request 
of the political class to be present at the National Dialogue 
Commission does not in any way mean going back on this 
principle, rather the opposite. The National People's Army, as 
a patriotic melting pot, should always be alongside the patriots 
who want to get the country out of the crisis that it has been 
enduring as a result of the methods of previous management. 
  The matter here concerns patriotic action, which should be 
an 
example followed by all the political and social partners as it 
would lead them to shoulder their responsibilities before 
history and carry out their tasks before the nation. The 
National People's Army adheres to its well-known principles that 
derive from the ideals of the patriotic movement and the 
declaration of the glorious November revolution, in which Islam 
remains a reference point for civilized development and the 
natural framework for social enlightenment as practiced by our 
nation throughout the ages. 
  In these difficult circumstances, the Army considers 
participation in overcoming the crisis as a patriotic matter 
that is binding on all. Anyone who retreats, or acts according 
to their own whims or personal or partisan ambitions will, in 
actual fact, be expressing their own failure and not the failure 
of society or of the political formations as a whole. This is 
because the country is approaching the national concord 
conference and also an interim period that will open up a new 
era for the Algerian people through which it can regain 
confidence in it's ability, and choose it's leaders and it's 
political institutions quite freely and away from any pressures 
or misrepresentations. 
  We would like to assert very strongly here that any solution 
to the crisis lies in the ability of the political classes to 
surmount narrow-mindlessness and partisan interests and to be up 
to the real tasks. 
  Fortunately, our political class does include many men and 
women who are very patriotic and sincere and who are determined 
to face up to the challenges, surmount short-term interests and 
give momentum to the real changes for which our people have been 
calling. 
  We see this change in the form of a clean break with past 
practices and the methods of management at all political, 
economic, and social levels. 
  The break, in which we believe and for which we are calling, 
should make a radical change in state institutions and functions 
by creating new criteria for them. 
  Given the colossal nature of the crisis and its 
complications, and given the radical nature of the changes that 
must be brought about, the National People's Army believes that 
such a break, to which our people aspire, will be achieved 
through the creation of a new national political system. 
  This new national system will consolidate true democracy, 
guarantee all individual and collective liberties, put a final 
end to political, economic, cultural and ideological monopolies, 
and help with the emergence of new men capable of bringing about 
these changes, the reification of the nation's aspirations for 
peace, fraternity, advancement, and the restoration of Algeria's 
standing and its position among nations. 
  In order to achieve all that, the National People's Army 
addresses a call to all male and female Algerians who are loyal 
to their homeland, and assures them that it will do its utmost 
to prepare the right circumstances to enable them to offer their 
contributions in order to save the country and return it to safe 
grounds. 
  May God help us all to succeed in doing what is good for the 
country. Glory and eternal life to our honorable martyrs. 
Peace and God's blessings be upon you.

  [Text] A French woman was shot with two bullets in the head 
this afternoon in Algiers. The woman, aged 45, was married to 
an Algerian and the mother of three children. She worked with 
the French Consulate in Algiers. She was the fourth French 
citizen to be killed in Algeria since last September, and the 
25th foreigner killed in the country. 
  The Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] has condemned what it 
has 
called an odious crime. The French ambassador was received this 
evening by Algerian Prime Minister Redha Malek. He told him 
about the concern of the French Government. As a sign of 
mourning, all French services in Algeria will be closed 
tomorrow, 16 January.

  [Text] Yesterday evening, a number of Palestinian political 
figures held a two-hour meeting with the U.S. peace team headed 
by Mr. Dennis Ross in Bayt al-Sharq in occupied East Jerusalem. 
  During the meeting the American side briefed the Palestinian 
side on the results of the meeting of U.S. President Bill 
Clinton with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad the day before 
yesterday in Geneva. 
  After the meeting Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi said that the 
Palestinian side stressed to the American side that any progress 
along the Syrian or other tracks tends to create progress in the 
remaining tracks. She added that the Palestinian leadership is 
committed to a comprehensive solution, and there must be Arab 
coordination and a complementary stance on this process along 
all the tracks. 
  The Palestinian side told the U.S. peace team that the 
United 
States should play a more effective role in the negotiations. 
  Dr. Sa'ib Urayqat who was present at the meeting said that 
long discussions took place about the negotiations in Taba and 
the problems which stand in their way as a result of the 
intransigent Israeli attitude on its method of explaining its 
concepts and its understanding of the American role in the peace 
process. 
  Dr. Urayqat said: We have explained the suffering of the 
people of the occupied territories as a result of Israeli 
practices, also the absorption operations and the seizure of 
land. We stressed to the American envoy that the continuation 
of Israeli practices over the land has made the peace process 
lose its credibility. 
  On the Palestinian side, the meeting was attended by Dr. 
Hanan Ashrawi, Dr. Sa'ib Urayqat, Dr. Nabil Qassis, Dr. Kamil 
al-'Isawi, the lawyer Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, and sister Ahlam 'Abbasi.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "New Syrian Role"] </F>
  [Text] The agreements and understandings reached at the 
Geneva summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton will lay the foundation for a new and 
different role for Damascus in the Arab region as a whole. They 
will also lay the foundations for a new U.S.-Syrian relationship 
as important as Egyptian-U.S. relations, if not more important. 
  President al-Asad has never opposed a settlement, otherwise 
he would not have gone to Madrid under a formula much smaller 
than the international conference formula proposed by the late 
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev. But he wanted something much 
more than a settlement. He wanted a stronger relationship with 
Washington, which is now the sole superpower in the world. He 
aspires to a new regional role through this relationship -- 
which explains his agreement to participate in the bilateral 
negotiations arising from the Madrid formula, and his refusal to 
participate in multilateral regional negotiations. 
  What is certain is that President al-Asad must have 
encountered satisfactory answers from the U.S. President to many 
of his demands in this connection for him to agree to full 
normalization with Israel, which means open borders and a 
diplomatic and trade exchange in return for an Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the presence of U.S. 
observation forces there. 
  The Geneva meeting -- which lasted five hours, of which 90 
minutes were devoted to a closed meeting between the two leaders 
without the accompanying delegations -- was the culmination of 
the previous agreements reached during U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's tours of the region, the most recent of 
which was last month. It is unreasonable to accept the theory 
that the understanding was reached in Geneva. Because there was 
insufficient time to discuss details of complex regional and 
local issues. The time was sufficient to bless the new 
agreements and scenarios reached and to tackle what could have 
been points of disagreements in previous talks. 
  It is wrong to rush to make definite judgments based on a 
quick reading of some press statements made after the historic 
meeting, or to interpret some phrases in different ways. 
Patience helps here to determine the truth. The coming days 
will reveal many details, whether during the bilateral 
negotiations and through the positions of the parties 
participating in them, or through the Syrian Government's 
positions on numerous matters, especially the opposition to the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement and ways of dealing with the PLO and the 
factions opposed to it. 
  Theoretically, after the Geneva meeting all disagreements 
between the PLO leadership and the Syrian Government should 
disappear. This is because everyone is now rallying under the 
banner of the U.S. settlement and has agreed to normalize with 
Israel and to deal with its government as an original party in 
the region, and no opposition to this new Palestinian-Syrian 
orientation has any place in Damascus, at least in the 
foreseeable future. 
  If this theoretical assumption is correct, the "veto" 
expressed by the Syrian Government against coordination with the 
PLO should be lifted after the Geneva meeting, and contacts 
should resume between the two sides at the highest levels in 
order to benefit from the new agreements so as to reactivate the 
peace process on all fronts, especially on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track, which experienced obstacles and 
deliberate delays in the run-up to the Geneva summit. 
  Damascus -- which led the Arabs to the war, disagreed with 
those whom it thought were for a settlement, and allied itself 
with anyone who opposed it -- finds itself today in a new 
position at the head of the camp of peace and normalization with 
Israel -- which will give rise to numerous questions about its 
old alliances, especially with Iran, and its old hostilities 
toward Iraq. Will we see Iraqi-Iranian rapprochement against 
the new Syrian role, or Iraqi-Syrian rapprochement against the 
clear Iranian hostility toward peace and normalization with 
Israel?! 
  The coming days will be full of surprises, and perhaps full 
of the political contradictions for which the region is known.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Movement on All Tracks Is Required"] </F>
  [Text] Some time will pass before practical reaction to 
the Syrian-U.S. summit can materialize into reality. This is 
because a great deal of that reaction and the outcome depend on 
the Israeli positions regarding withdrawal from the Golan and 
achievement of results on the other Arab negotiating tracks, 
particularly the Palestinian and Lebanese tracks. 
  The Geneva summit put the ball in the Israeli court after 
Syria proved to the U.S. sponsor its complete readiness to bear 
the consequences of total peace, including the establishment of 
normal relations with Israel. Israeli officials, however, still 
prefer to ignore this reality and to insist on the Syrian side's 
pronouncement of the word "normalization," as if there is a 
difference between normalizing relations and establishment of 
normal relations. 
  Certainly, Syria is still committed -- just as the other 
Arab 
negotiating parties -- to the comprehensiveness and justness of 
a peaceful solution and, consequently, to the Arab link in 
general, especially the Syrian, with the Palestinian cause. 
Realization of the Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations 
will remain a constant factor despite the momentary differences 
in viewpoints between the Arab brothers. The supreme Arab 
interest is above any other consideration, especially as all the 
Arab parties have chosen the strategy of peace and a negotiated 
settlement. Hence, amid the political ambiguity prevailing in 
the region now, one fact seems certain: None of the Arab 
parties will sign a final and separate peace agreement with 
Israel, rather all of them are striving for a comprehensive 
peace in the interest of the region's peoples and their future 
generations. 
  In this context, any agreement or settlement with any Arab 
party will not be complete unless it coincides with integrated 
settlements with the other parties. Hence, the Palestinian 
side's approach and conviction is that any concrete negotiating 
achievement realized on any negotiating track is, in the larger 
sense, in the Arab interest. If the Syrian-U.S. summit has 
managed to put the foundation for Israeli withdrawal and 
evacuation from the Golan Heights -- this if we assume that 
Israel will respond to this just Arab demand, refrains from 
placing obstacles to it, and does not pursue the known method of 
procrastination -- the signing of a comprehensive peace 
agreement will still depend on the realization of withdrawal 
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, south Lebanon, and the 'Arava 
Valley within framework of an integrated Arab solution 
comprising the Arab parties interested in peace, without 
exception. 
  We are now awaiting the practical Israeli reaction to the 
Geneva summit after Syria announced its readiness to bear the 
burden of peace as of this moment. That response must not be 
confined to the Syrian track alone but, in conformity with the 
comprehensive concept of peace, should extend to include the 
other negotiating tracks, foremost of all the stalled 
negotiations for more than two months with the Palestinian side. 
Those negotiations were supposed to end positively several 
weeks ago.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Werner A. </F>
Beninger in Tunis on 16 January: "I Wish Kreisky Were Still 
Alive"] 
  [Text] [Beninger] What is the present state of the 
negotiations with Israel, above all on the following main topics: 
  -- The dimension of the Jericho area, which Israel only 
defines as the town of Jericho covering 27 square kilometers, 
whereas the PLO defines it as the old Jordanian administrative 
district covering more than 350 square kilometers; 
  -- The issue of control of the borders between Gaza and 
Egypt, and Jericho and Jordan; 
  -- The problem of the Jewish settlers and their security? 
  ['Arafat] Regrettably, I must say that the Israelis are 
still not negotiating honestly and are not really ready to keep 
to the accords of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The crucial date 
is 13 April (according to the agreement of 13 September 1993, 
the Israeli soldiers must have left the autonomy areas by that 
date -- editorial board). This is where it all starts, the 
points of the agreement are not being observed. Israel 
continues to insist on having control of the border crossings. 
This means that the Israelis do not withdraw, but want to 
maintain the present status. They insist on making Gaza a 
Palestinian ghetto. 
  The same holds true for Jericho. Who could accept their 
intention to stay? Who would be ready to invest money in an 
Israeli annex or a ghetto? Who would be ready to do so? These 
are the maneuvers that the Israelis are now trying to carry out. 
  [Beninger] What specifically does this mean for the 
continuation of the negotiations, for the peace process in the 
Middle East? 
  ['Arafat] Take the Jericho area as an example, against the 
background of what we discussed. The province of Jericho is 712 
square kilometers large -- according to a definition of the 
Israeli administration. Then they offered us 27 square 
kilometers, which they increased to 50 square kilometers in 
their latest proposal. What is this supposed to be? A ghetto, a 
new enclave? The Israelis speak about so very small areas, even 
though under the agreement signed, they must pull out of all 
these areas within four months. What does it mean? It means 
that it is their intention not to pull out. 
  [Beninger] In view of these facts, is it realistic at all to 
believe that the time schedule under which the Israeli 
withdrawal is to be completed by 13 April can be met at all? 
One is already in default now. 
  ['Arafat] Rabin has said repeatedly that not even 13 April 
is a fixed date. What does that mean? 
  [Beninger] But if the time schedule cannot be fulfilled, do 
you see any possibility at all of keeping under control the 
disappointment and bitterness of the people who live in the 
occupied territories? 
  ['Arafat] That depends on those who signed the agreement 
together with us. We will then also have to see how the 
international community will react. After all, this agreement 
was not only signed by the Israelis. In the final analysis, it 
is an international agreement. Then it will depend on how the 
Europeans, how Clinton and the Americans react. 
  [Beninger] Does the PLO have specific options to stop 
violence in the occupied territories? 
  ['Arafat] This is not the only issue. There is also 
continuing oppression and the provocation of violence. Why are 
they continuing to confiscate new land and to build new 
settlements, specifically near Jerusalem? The isolation of 
Jerusalem is being increased. Then there is the additional 
scandal that happened only last Christmas when they granted 
Christians special status in the holy places. 
  [Beninger] Accordingly, the Gaza-Jericho agreement so far 
has changed nothing at all for the people in the occupied 
territories. It is true that the refugees who left Palestine 
after 1967 have been guaranteed the right to return, but in 
fact, they are not admitted into the country. No more than 650 
of more than 10,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons have been 
released, and the oppressive measures of the occupation 
authorities has not declined, as you said. 
  ['Arafat] What we agreed upon must finally be respected. 
This means that the most important points now are the 
withdrawal and independence. At the beginning of the third year 
-- not in the course of, but at the beginning! -- we must 
discuss the other problems. 
  [Beninger] But is it not true that fewer Palestinians have 
been released than expected? 
  ['Arafat] Not only that. The oppressive measures against 
our women and our people are continuing to escalate. The 
continuation of these activities certainly shows what game the 
Israelis are continuing to play. 
  [Beninger] But there are also efforts to split the 
Palestinian people. For instance, following secret talks with 
the radical Hamas people, to which Rabin had sent him, General 
Doran reported recently that Hamas would prefer Israeli 
occupation to autonomy -- for fear of a regime by 'Arafat and 
his people. 
  ['Arafat] That is a wrong story that the Israelis keep 
repeating. They are trying to play us off against one another. 
We are sure, however, that our unity is strong, much too strong 
to be jeopardized by such efforts. 
  [Beninger] Nonetheless, how about your relations with 
Hamas? Do you believe their assertions that they want to 
prevent civil war? 
  ['Arafat] Why civil war? Who is talking about civil war? 
This is something the Israelis talk about. Their military 
officers sell weapons, guns, because they hope the Palestinians 
could then start waging war against one another, they hope they 
will be split. The Israelis must withdraw. Please tell every 
Israeli, every Israeli official, that I am sure that such 
actions will not influence our free men, our free people in any 
way. They will have no influence on a democracy and a society 
in which human rights are respected. 
  You should remember, for instance, that many Palestinian 
organizations were represented in Beirut that had all types of 
weapons -- guns, rifles, and even tanks. Nothing happened among 
them. Rather there was unity and stability among the 
Palestinians. We are certain that the Palestinians will 
demonstrate responsibility. Granted, there will be opposition, 
but this is part of our democracy. 
  [Beninger] Against this background, how about your relations 
with Syria? Will you meet with President al-Asad in the next 
few weeks? 
  ['Arafat] If there is an opportunity, why not? But we 
should not forget that there was a meeting in Damascus recently 
between Syria, Egypt, and other states, and these states 
expressly support the declaration that we signed with Israel. 
  [Beninger] You will need huge sums to reconstruct Gaza and 
Jericho.... 
  ['Arafat] ... and the West Bank. 
  [Beninger] How about the financial situation of the PLO? 
  ['Arafat] You know that several countries promised us help. 
We have pledges from the World Bank and the EC. We have a 
number of bilateral pledges, and U.S. President Clinton promised 
us $2.2 billion at short notice. 
  [Beninger] There has been vehement criticism from your own 
ranks in recent weeks about yourself and your leadership style. 
  ['Arafat] Are you against democracy? Isn't this so in 
Austria, too? Why do you speak about democracy in your country, 
whereas in the case of the Palestinians, you do not consider 
criticism a sign of democracy? If there is no opposition, 
something is wrong. 
  [Beninger] Do you have concrete plans to bind the people who 
are opposed to you into the work? 
  ['Arafat] Of course, they will also help reconstruct their 
country. 
  [Beninger] Some Palestinian experts and even the World Bank 
and the European Community have criticized the fact that you 
brought PEDRA (Palestine Economic Development and Reconstruction 
Authority, which is to take over management of the entire aid 
funds -- editorial board) under your personal control, and the 
two vice presidents of PEDRA (Faruq Qaddumi and Mohammed Zahdi 
-- editorial board), who are politicians and no economic experts 
.... 
  ['Arafat] Who says that? These are rumors. 
  [Beninger] So there was criticism? 
  ['Arafat] Some, but no official criticism, just one of those 
obstructive maneuvers and rumors. We are talking about facts. 
A counter example is the way the World Bank is dealing with our 
economic facilities. The same holds true for Europe, the 
European Community. 
  [Beninger] How do you assess Austria's role in the Middle 
East process? During the Bruno Kreisky era, Austria played a 
decisive role in the region. This is not nearly the case any 
more to the former extent. 
  ['Arafat] We should not forget what they are doing now. 
What the Austrians are doing is very important. They are doing 
their best. 
  [Beninger] Does this also include their material aid, which, 
compared with comparable countries, appears to be a bit small, 
doesn't it? 
  ['Arafat] We are satisfied with what the kindly people in 
Austria are doing for us. But we should never forget what a 
significant role my friend, Bruno Kreisky, played for us. I 
wish he could be here. I wish he were still alive.

  [Text] Manama, 18 Jan (WAKH) -- Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, 
head of the Palestinian negotiating team, has said that the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement is an accomplished fact because the 
Palestinian leadership [words indistinct] signed it and because 
the world adopted it as a basis for the achievement of peace in 
the region. 
  However, in a statement to the Bahraini paper AL-AYYAM 
today, 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi noted that this agreement places the 
Palestinian side [words indistinct] in a difficult position 
because it does not address the issue of the continued Israeli 
settlement activity in the occupied territories. Rather, he 
said, the agreement gives Israel more reasons to justify its 
denial of the Palestinian rights to self-determination, 
independent statehood, and repatriation. 
  He said that he believes that this agreement can be dealt 
with while maintaining inalienable Palestinian rights. He noted 
that this can be achieved through effecting a national unity 
among the various political factions on a democratic basis. 
  Talking about the situation inside the Palestinian home, the 
Palestinian negotiator expressed satisfaction with what is going 
on between Palestinian officials and the Palestinian opposition. 
  He said that the next phase requires the PLO apparatus, 
which 
was established on the basis of an armed struggle, to make 
unusual preparations. Now it must adapt itself for the next 
phase.

  [Text] The talks between the PLO and Israel on Palestinian 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho will be resumed today. The talks 
are progressing sluggishly and Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former 
chairman of the Palestinian delegation to the talks, now warns, 
during a visit to Stockholm, of the continued expansion of 
Jewish settlements in occupied territories. It is the biggest 
threat to the peace process in the Middle East, he thinks. Aake 
Wiklund of The Echo program met him: 
  [Wiklund] Israel does not admit that any new Jewish 
settlements are being built in occupied territories, but Dr. 
Haydar says that he has reliable information, and this is 
totally in breach of the meaning of the peace work and how you 
view the final step toward Palestinian self-rule. In comparison 
with the Israeli settlement policy, all other issues are 
irrelevant, Dr. Haydar says. 
  [Begin Haydar recording, in English] In my opinion, it is 
the 
settlement process. I think it is much more important than all 
the other issues. I don't think, I think the -- what they have 
been arguing about, the question of control of the crossings, 
the size of Jericho, all this -- in my opinion it is irrelevant. 
[end recording] 
  [Wiklund] Dr Haydar was one of the Palestinians whom Yasir 
'Arafat picked from obscurity in Gaza and the West Bank to 
negotiate with Israel on behalf of the PLO. However, after 
Israel elected to speak directly to 'Arafat, the Palestinian 
voices have disappeared from the negotiation scene. The PLO 
headquarters in Tunis has been in the limelight. 
  A couple of weeks ago, heading a Palestinian delegation, Dr. 
Haydar travelled to Tunis and demanded a larger measure of 
democracy within the PLO. They received no promise of change. 
But we in the occupied areas will continue to demand a 
democratic order and we refuse to sacrifice competence to 
political and personal considerations, he said. That is a 
diplomatic way of expressing one's dissatisfaction with Arafat's 
autocratic leadership and the group around him in Tunis. 
  Many representatives of the PLO now view with mixed feelings 
the recent summit in Geneva between President Clinton and Syrian 
President al-Asad, where a settlement between Syria and Israel 
seems to have moved closer. They fear that the negotiations 
about Palestinian rule will now be pushed into the background. 
But Dr. Haydar trusts the Syrian president. 
  [Begin Haydar recording] [words indistinct] President 
al-Asad 
did not neglect the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and talking 
about the comprehensiveness of the issue of peace. [end 
recording] 
  [Wiklund] I do not think that al-Asad will neglect our 
negotiations with Israel, he says, noting that the Syrian 
president stressed the importance of a comprehensive peace in 
the Middle East and emphasized that the peace process is 
indivisible. That satisfies us, says this old hand in 
negotiations.

<F P=106> [Michael Smith report: "British to Train PLO Police] </F>
  [Text] A British Chief Constable is to help train the 
Palestinian police force in the proposed Gaza-Jericho autonomous 
zone to be set up under a peace agreement between Israel and the 
PLO. 
  Mr. Dan Crompton, Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire said 
yesterday the PLO had asked the Foreign Office to help set up a 
British-style community police force. 
  The agreement envisages the withdrawal of Israeli forces, 
leaving a Palestinian police force in its place. 
  Mr. Crompton, with three or four other officers, will train 
senior officers within that force. He will visit the occupied 
territories next month with another officer from his force, 
Acting Chief Supt [superintendent] John Tunney, to meet 
potential candidates and assess training needs. 
  It is also possible he will visit PLO headquarters in Tunis 
for further consultations before setting up a course in March. 
  "The Palestinians have asked us for advice on structuring 
and 
training," Mr. Crompton said. 
  "They don't want a paramilitary style force. What they want 
is a move to the community style policing you see in the UK. 
  "They are anxious to show a quantum leap if you like between 
the sort of occupying force we have seen there up to now and a 
British-style force. But it is likely to be a rocky road. 
  "There is no common law in existence in the occupied 
territories." 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain would also be 
providing equipment for the Palestinian police force as well as 
helping to train nurses, build schools and give advice in the 
management of water resources. 
  The Palestinians had also asked for help in setting up a 
radio station, particularly in the training of journalists, a 
role expected to be undertaken by the BBC and the Thompson 
Foundation.

  [Excerpt] A ranking Palestinian official has warned against 
the flow of weapons into the West Bank and Gaza Strip, adding 
that the sources of these weapons are known. In a statement to 
AL-DUSTUR, 'Abbas Zaki, member of the Fatah Central Committee, 
said that Palestinian citizens purchase weapons under the slogan 
of self-defense, not under militant slogans. He said that the 
purchases are not carried out at central instructions, adding 
that this situation would create uncontrollable chaos. 
  'Abbas Zaki added: We discovered an Israeli plan to sow 
sedition among citizens in the occupied territory. He warned 
the fighters, particularly the Fatah Hawks, against carrying 
their weapons and shooting in the streets. He said: The 
Israeli enemy is encouraging such manifestations within the 
framework of its preparation for a civil war. 
  Zaki disclosed that the Israelis are propagating a 
particular 
type of weapon which is also a detector. This weapon, he added, 
transmits signals which will help the Israeli soldiers, who 
carry electronic devices, locate this weapon and arrest its 
carrier. He added that one of the Fatah cadres was arrested by 
this method although he was in a safe place. Meanwhile, he 
said, the Israeli Army was unable to arrest this cadre's 
colleague who lost his weapon in a fedayeen operation. 'Abbas 
Zaki said: The Israeli Army can collect these weapons if they 
are used against it anytime it wants. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bethlehem--QUDS PRESS--Authorized Palestinian 
sources have informed QUDS PRESS that the Palestine National 
Liberation Movement, Fatah, and the Palestinian People's Party 
[PPP] (formerly the Palestinian Communist Party) are about to 
agree on a political program that will identify the bases of 
future Palestinian action, thus ending bilateral differences. 
  Hanna 'Amirah, a prominent PPP official in the occupied 
territories, said that intensive talks are currently under way 
between both sides under President Yasir 'Arafat and PPP 
Secretary General Bashir al-Barghuthi, who is currently in Tunis 
at the head of a large PPP delegation. 
  'Amirah described the talks as "positive and constructive," 
adding that they are being held in a "cordial and fraternal 
atmosphere." However, he has not set a date for signing this 
program. 
  In a statement to a QUDS PRESS correspondent, 'Amirah said 
that the bilateral talks are focusing on the delineation of a 
higher Palestinian authority, a comprehensive negotiating 
strategy, and the criteria to be heeded when the future 
Palestinian National Authority is formed. This authority, 
'Amirah noted, must represent all colors of the Palestinian 
spectrum. The citizens of the occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip, women, and clergymen must be involved in this authority. 
The composition of this authority must also heed the factor of 
territorial representation, as he put it. 
  'Amirah said that a detailed discussion of the formation of 
this authority has been postponed pending the signing of the 
program of action by both sides. He added: "Both sides must 
now reach such an agreement to settle all contentious political 
issues." 
  The Palestinian official ruled out the PPP's possible 
participation in the Palestinian committees negotiating with 
Israel at present, saying: "This is contingent upon the 
Palestinian leadership's compliance with the recent PLO 
Executive Committee decisions, which spelled out the bases of 
negotiations." 
  The PPP is considered Fatah's major partner in the 
negotiations with Israel. However, it has suspended its 
participation in the negotiations since the ninth round of the 
Washington talks due to substantive differences on the bases of 
the negotiating process. 
  The PPP, along with other Palestinian factions, is demanding 
democratic reforms in the Palestinian decisionmaking process. 
It is also demanding changes in the way the negotiations with 
Israel are being conducted. Palestinian reformists fear that 
these secret negotiations could be a mere attempt to fragment 
their ranks, particularly in the aftermath of their launching a 
follow-up committee to press ahead with their demands with the 
Palestinian leadership.

<F P=106> [Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi report: "Two Fatah and People's </F>
Party Officials Confirm Rapprochement Between Their Two 
Organizations"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- A senior official of the Palestinian 
People's Party [PPP] (formerly the Communist Party) has revealed 
that there are serious indications that the two-month-old crisis 
between the PPP and the PLO leadership is being resolved. In an 
interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, PPP Secretary General Bashir 
al-Barghuthi said that the numerous meetings held in Tunis last 
week with Fatah officials produced positive results, 
particularly including an agreement on formulating clear and 
common ground between his party and Fatah regarding developments 
related to the current negotiations with Israel for the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles as well as 
current Palestinian conditions. 
  This development comes after months of estrangement and cool 
relations between the PPP and the Palestinian leadership 
resulting in the PPP's suspension of its participation in the 
last rounds of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations in 
Washington and boycott of the work of the joint 
Palestinian-Israeli committees for the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles in Egypt. 
  Al-Barghuthi said that the impasse reached in the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations for the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles was new evidence of the need for the 
Palestinian leadership to understand and respond to the demands 
made by the PPP. He emphasized that these were national, not 
partisan or factional demands, aimed mainly at strengthening 
Palestinian national unity through the introduction of clear and 
realistic concepts of what should be done in the current and 
next phases to ensure fulfillment of the Palestinian people's 
aspirations. 
  On the PPP's position on the current negotiations between 
the 
PLO and Israel on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, al-Barghuthi said: There can be no doubt that the 
situation is difficult. It is clear that, under the pressure of 
internal opposition, the Israeli Government has retreated from 
previous positions. That makes it necessary for the Palestinian 
side to consolidate its unity and explain its position to Arab 
and international public opinion. It is also necessary for the 
Palestinian parties which support the Declaration of Principles 
to assess the situation. 
  The Palestinians, al-Barghuthi said, have no alternative now 
but to insist on their positions, strengthen their internal 
front, close their ranks, and continue their struggle. 
  Al-Barghuthi said that his party categorically rejected the 
recent Israeli proposals on the crossing points and the area of 
Jericho. He added that "these proposals are totally rejected 
and should not be accepted because they run contrary to the 
Declaration of Principles." He pointed out that the Jericho 
area under Ottoman, British, and Jordanian rules always reached 
the River Jordan. 
  On Fatah's side, Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), its official 
in charge of mobilization and organization, emphasized that the 
PPP, as a part of the existing PLO coalition, had expressed 
interest in bilateral relations with Fatah that would cover 
organization and coordination in the various fields of common 
interest. Fatah, he said, welcomes such a formula which should 
be open to all the Palestinian forces which support the 
political grounds on which the Declaration of Principles was 
based. 
  He added that that formula would be tantamount to an agreed 
framework for political and field cooperation in the occupied 
territory among all the organizations which share similar views 
on a political settlement based on the same foundation, namely 
the Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September. 
  Abu-Mahir emphasized that the purpose of that bilateral 
formula is to scrutinize daily activities and draw the necessary 
plans for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles on 
the ground to pave the way for a Palestinian state.

  [Excerpt] Ghassan al-Biyari has again won the elections 
for the post of chairman of the Gaza Strip Palestine Trade Union 
Federation, established in 1965. 
  Al-Biyari told DAVAR yesterday he was unanimously elected by 
more than the 50 union heads, and will serve in the post for 
another term of two years. 
  Three lists competed in the elections: Fatah, the People's 
Party (the former Communist Party), and the Democratic Front. 
The results of the elections indicate that control over the 
trade unions remain in the hands of Fatah, considering the fact 
that al-Biyari is affiliated with this organization. The 
radical Muslim groups have absolutely no foothold in Gaza Strip 
trade unions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary </F>
general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement, by Ibrahim 
Humaydi in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the 
Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement, has stressed that the 
failure of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) or any other 
faction to boycott the self-rule elections would torpedo the 
"Alliance of Palestinian Forces" formed recently by the 10 
factions opposed to the peace process. However, he pointed to 
the assertion by representatives of Hamas that it will not 
participate in these elections. 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, al-Shaqaqi said he expects 
Fatah--the Revolutionary Council, led by Sabri al-Banna 
(Abu-Nidal), to join the alliance. He said: "I am not alarmed" 
at that. He said that Iran's "aid to us is much less than many 
people imagine." And that the money is transferred to the 
leaderships inside [the occupied territories] through trade 
operations between the inside and the outside. 
  Dr. al-Shaqaqi said that he "strongly supports the idea of 
expanding the alliance so as to include the largest number of 
opposition forces possible," including Fatah--the Revolutionary 
Council (led by Abu-Nidal). He expects this movement to request 
to join the opposition alliance. "Or we may invite it to join 
us" in the future. "I personally am not alarmed at the 
existence of this color in the coalition." However, he stressed 
that the question "has not yet been raised at the 10 factions' 
meetings." 
  The secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement said 
that 
he "played a special role" to avert the failure of the central 
meeting held recently by the 10 factions. "I managed to bring 
views closer among these organizations, due to our awareness of 
the seriousness of this stage. No one wants to be held 
responsible for obstructing the plan" opposed to the self-rule 
[agreement] signed between Israel and the PLO. He stressed: 
"None of the participants made any real concession, because all 
were winners. We deferred the influence question and left it up 
to reality, because it is reality which determines the influence 
of every faction" -- a reference to the deferment of the 
question of every faction's share in the "leadership committee." 
Hamas wants a 40-percent share of representation. 
  Asked for his opinion of the alliance's ability to form an 
alternative organization to the PLO or to rebuild the PLO, 
al-Shaqaqi said: "I have no problem. What is important is the 
political program. And even when the PLO was formed on the 
basis of influence, it did not reflect the reality precisely." 
  He added that his decision does not focus on a certain 
tendency's leadership of the alliance of factions, and its 
demand for a larger representation ratio "reflects our 
self-confidence, because the organization is not an idol we 
worship. What we are interested in is public welfare, hence our 
stress on the political program." He pointed out that the real 
role of any Palestinian organization should be played on the 
ground. 
  He confirmed that Hamas representatives had stressed their 
refusal to participate in the upcoming self-rule elections. "If 
anyone deviates from this, we will pull out (of the alliance), 
and any deviation from the political program would cause us to 
abandon it." He said that the agreed political program "is a 
common denominator" among the views of all organizations, while 
there are some differences over certain questions. 
  On the ability of these factions to topple the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, al-Shaqaqi said: "We are aware of the difficulty of 
the matter in view of the absence of international support. 
However, the weakness of the agreement, the continuation of the 
intifadah, the people's rejection of the agreement, and the 
continuation of the jihad indicate that it may collapse." 
  He pointed to the existence of "Arab and Iranian support" 
for 
those opposed to the agreement. He said that "there is an 
atmosphere of opposition in the region, and we must exploit it. 
This can be done by asserting our influence on the ground, thus 
prompting our friends to provide further aid. Our weakness 
would cause them to lose confidence in us." 
  Al-Shaqaqi added that "the forces supporting us will be 
willing to offer more political support when we are united." On 
his relationship with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, 
al-Shaqaqi said: "There is no personal problem between us, and 
there has never been any direct contact in our history. The 
national criterion is the basis of the relationship, and the 
position is political." He pointed to "a war of circumvention 
and blackmail" which 'Arafat exercised against the Islamic 
Jihad. He said that the Palestinian president "traded in our 
movement's name by using some of the distorted names and models 
which he tried to manufacture for himself on the Palestinian 
scene." And that he "ordered one of his supporters to announce 
the Islamic Jihad's support for the agreement." 
  With regard to the movement's relationship with Syria, the 
Islamic Jihad Movement secretary general said that Damascus "is 
open to all Arabs. It is in a state of war with the Zionist 
entity. It has no objection to the presence of Palestinian 
forces working from Syria to liberate their land, as this is in 
line with the general political orientation in Syria." He 
pointed out that one of the movement's deportees whom Israel 
allowed to return from south Lebanon refused to return to the 
occupied territories and is present now in Damascus. 
  Al-Shaqaqi said that Iranian financial to the movement "is 
limited; we admire the Iranian revolution's ideas opposed to 
international arrogance and calling for the liberation of all 
Palestine." 
  He said that aid is transferred to the inside through "trade 
operations between the inside and Europe and Egypt. It is an 
easy process. The aid is received by neutral parties inside." 
He added that the Jihad leadership focuses "primarily on the 
inside. So all our resources are sent there. We do not want to 
conduct any organizational development outside." 
  He noted that coordination between the inside and the 
leadership outside is conducted through the normal communication 
means, namely telephone, fax, and personal representatives. 
"Our cadres total a few thousands while our supporters exceed 
this number by far." 
  He pointed out that the movement is currently considering 
the 
idea of unifying the military wing in order to adopt one of two 
known names: the "Struggling Islamic Forces" [al-quwwat 
al-islamiyah al-mujahidah] or "Battalions of the Sword of Islam" 
[kata'ib sayf al-'Islam]. He also said that the movement had 
carried out several military operations inside; "we acquire our 
weapons through arms dealers inside, through smuggling from 
neighboring states, or through purchase from traders acting as 
brokers with Israeli soldiers." 
  On his movement's relationship with Hamas, al-Shaqaqi 
pointed 
out that "there is coordination between us, and we will contest 
the engineer union elections in Gaza on one list in the next few 
days. We do not deny Hamas' distinguished role" in the occupied 
territories. He stressed that the idea of "unity with Hamas is 
not far off." And that time "has reduced differences between 
us, and political positions are similar now. We are aware that 
organizational accounts do not disappear easily, and we are 
currently working to end these sensitivities in order to achieve 
the cooperation and unity plans." He pointed to the existence 
of "security" difficulties obstructing the formation of the 
"National and Islamic Command of the Intifadah," which the 
opposition factions have agreed to set up, and "we will work to 
iron out the difficulties."

  [Text] A PLO delegation that visited the Vatican during the 
last three days, has reached an agreement on the setting up of a 
joint committee to define the existing bilateral relations 
between the organization [PLO] and the Vatican, in an official 
document. 
  The Vatican spokesman considered what has been achieved 
during the bilateral meetings between the organization and the 
Vatican as an important starting point that constitutes an 
initial step toward officially promoting the relations. 
  The organization's delegation, led by brother Muhammad Zuhdi 
al-Nashashibi, member of the PLO Executive Committee, Nimr 
Hammad, Ibrahim al-Daqqaq, and Zuhdi al-Tarazi, had held talks 
over two days at the Vatican with a high-ranking Vatican 
delegation led by the Vatican's foreign minister [title as 
received], Jean-Louis Tauran, and with the participation of the 
deputy [foreign] minister and the head of the Middle East 
Department. 
  The Vatican's official delegation said during the talks that 
the Vatican's policy was firm and has not changed regarding the 
Palestinian people's inalienable rights, the issue of Jerusalem, 
and the Palestinian people's right to regain it, and the 
Vatican's commitment to legal legitimacy on the basis of UN 
Resolution 181, stipulating the partition [of Palestine] and the 
establishment of two states [Palestine and Israel]. 
  In another development, WAFA's [Palestinian news agency] 
correspondent in Rome has learnt that the Palestinian-Vatican 
joint committee will continue its meeting at a later time to 
draw up all the details in connection with bilateral relations.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 17, IRNA -- Iran's President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani here today underlined the significance of the 
development of human resources in the Third World countries and 
said no economic development could be achieved in the absence of 
human development. 
  The president's remark was part of his message read at the 
inaugural session of the international seminar on development in 
Central Asia and the Caucasus. Foreign ministers and academy 
heads of the Central Asian and Caucasian countries as well as 
academicians from 17 countries are attending the seminar. 
  Unfortunately, the message read, the unsuitable economic 
situation in the world and financial and economic bottlenecks 
among the majority of the developing nations have hindered 
process of the development of human resources. President 
Rafsanjani deplored that the outbreak of civil wars between some 
of the newly-independent Central Asian republics, in addition to 
imposing heavy arms expenses, had created obstacles for the 
economy of certain regional counties. 
  "In the contemporary era when the so-called new world order 
is taking shape, there are still drastic and growing economic 
imbalance between the developed and the developing nations," the 
message said. Such a deep gap would not only have its adverse 
impacts on eonomic relations, it would also threaten 
international peace and tranquility, the president noted in his 
message. He expressed hope that the seminar could take 
effective steps in consolidation of diplomatic, economic and 
cultural ties among Central Asian and Caucasian countries and in 
further upgrading living standards of their nations. 
  Experts and statesmen from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Tajikistan, 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Britain, U.S., 
Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, India, China, Lebanon, Cyprus, 
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and U.N. Development 
Program (UNDP) are attending the 3-day seminar.
