  [Text] Nakhichevan Culture Minister Geydarov has described 
the Islamic Republic of Iran as Azerbaijan's most influential 
protector. In talks with officials in Tabriz on 16 January, 
Geydarov said he regretted the Islamic countries' indifference 
to the effort by Islamic peoples to solve their problems and 
said that all Islamic peoples must make a concerted effort to 
solve the existing problems. He asserted: Some 20 percent of 
Azerbaijan's territory is occupied by Armenia. Some 1 million 
people in Azerbaijan, which has a population of 7 million, have 
lost their homes and property. They are living as refugees 
right now. 
  Geydarov thanked the Islamic Republic of Iran for its 
humanitarian aid to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic [NAR]. 
  NAR University President Gasanov has said his university is 
prepared to establish a new college for religious studies and 
teaching Persian language and literature with the help of 
Iranian lecturers. Gasanov arrived in Iran together with 
Geydarov to participate in the seminary conference on 
development in the Caucasus and Central Asia. In a statement to 
our correspondent in Tabriz on Sunday [16 January], Gasanov 
stressed the need to improve scientific and cultural cooperation 
between the NAR and the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  During his 24-hour visit to Tabriz, Gasanov held talks with 
the officials of the State University on the exchange of 
students and lecturers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Iran's New Effort To End the </F>
Clashes Between Azerbaijan and Armenia"] 
  [Text] Morteza Banki, director of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran Foreign Ministry CIS Affairs Department, has visited Baku 
and Yerevan. His visit marked the beginning of a new stage in 
Iran's diplomatic mediation effort to establish peace between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the Armenian foreign 
minister received Banki in Yerevan. He conveyed President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's 
messages to the Armenian officials. They explained the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's position on regional issues, particularly on 
the clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and reemphasized 
Iran's hope that a political solution will be found to the 
problem. 
  Banki later left Yerevan for Baku to hold talks with 
Azerbaijani officials. He met President Aliyev and the 
Azerbaijani foreign minister and briefed them on his talks in 
Yerevan and the latest visit of Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, 
President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy on Karabakh, to Tehran. 
Banki's talks in Yerevan and Baku indicate Iran's wish to 
contribute to the effort to find a political solution to the war 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia. [10-second break in transmission] 
  The war has resulted in the occupation of a large part of 
Azerbaijan's territory. The fighting has harmed the 
humanitarian forces and resources in other fields on the two 
sides. And it has put economic, political, and social pressures 
on Azerbaijan and Armenia. These fields should have helped 
Azerbaijan and Armenia to strengthen their independence and 
complete their restructuring. Under the existing conditions, the 
war must immediately end before it assumes an international 
nature. The two countries' military forces must withdraw to 
their recognized borders in accordance with agreements, 
including that which was signed in Tehran in 1993. Azerbaijan 
and Armenia must hold talks to resolve their disputes. That was 
the objective behind Banki's visit to Baku and Yerevan. 
  Iran will maintain its mediation effort to realize that 
objective.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 25, IRNA -- President 'Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani on Tuesday [24 January] voiced the Islamic 
Republic's readiness for closer cooperation with the Economic 
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). 
  Speaking to the visiting ESCAP executive secretary Raffi 
Ad-Din Ahmad, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said the organization was 
pursuing human and holy goals and therefore it was necessary for 
all regional countries to strengthen their cooperation with 
ESCAP in a bid to attain those goals. 
  Many of the goals the ESCAP is trying to attain are among 
the 
priorities in the economic development plan of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, he said. 
  The president said that connection of Iranian railway to 
those of the Central Asian countries would prove effective in 
boosting mutual economic and trade relations and in transiting 
commodities from Central Asia to other countries via Iran. 
  The ESCAP chief briefed the president on some of the major 
programs of the organization including upgrading economic 
relations of developing countries, controlling the growth of 
population and expanding communications via Iran and Pakistan 
with west and west Asian countries [as received], ECO [Economic 
Cooperation Organization] and ASEAN member states. 
  Holding a conference on women, expanding manpower and 
tackling the issue of disability and treating the disabled are 
among other goals of the economic and social commission for Asia 
and the Pacific, he said.

  [Text] The third stage of the massive Fath-3 exercise, 
which started two days ago in the waters of the northern Persian 
Gulf, continued today. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Ground, naval, and air units of 
the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic 
Revolution Guard Corps [IRGC] took part in this stage of the 
exercise under the joint Fath command. In the third stage of 
the Fath-3 exercise, battleships and frigates of the Navy and 
naval units of the IRGC -- including the Marine Brigade, Kowsar 
Naval Brigade, and the Qader Logistics Brigade -- attacked to 
recapture the areas in the southern coastline of Khuzestan, 
which had been occupied by the imaginary enemy, with support 
from fighter-bombers of the Air Force of the Armed Forces and 
heavy artillery fire from the Ground Forces of the IRGC. 
  Also, the sea-air high-flying helicopters of the Navy and 
gunboats of the IRGC attacked the vessels of the imaginary 
enemy. In order to achieve predetermined objectives, 
paratroopers of the airborne committee [as heard] of the IRGC, 
in coordination with the Air Force, conducted airborne 
operations behind the lines of the imaginary enemy and prepared 
the ground for landing paratroopers and commandos. 
  An informed military expert in the Fath command headquarters 
said: The Fath-3 exercise is one of the biggest -- and the most 
unprecedented -- joint exercises involving the three branches of 
the forces of the IRGC and the Armed Forces of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran that has taken place in the waters of the 
northern Persian Gulf.

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Dr. </F>
Hasan Rowhani, first deputy speaker and head of the Majles 
Foreign Policy Commission, by unidentified MAJLES VA PAZHUHESH 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [MAJLES VA PAZHUHESH] We thank Your Excellency 
for granting us the opportunity to talk with you. The topics 
that we would like to discuss cover an extensive range because 
of Your Excellency's various responsibilities and records. 
However, we will have to limit these topics. With your 
permission, we will start with the Majles. 
  You are among the deputies who have been in the various 
terms 
of the Majles since its formation, and you are now the deputy 
speaker and head of the Majles Foreign Policy Commission. We 
would like you to compare the fourth term of the Majles with the 
first, second, and third terms. One of the things that is done 
at the [Majles] research center is to study the activities of 
the Majles and to see what steps can be taken to improve it. 
What is your assessment of the two years of activities by the 
fourth term, and what is your view on what should be done in the 
two years that remain of the term and that are extremely 
significant years, too? 
  [Rowhani] [passage omitted] There are many new faces in the 
fourth term of the Majles, compared with previous terms. This 
is one of the special characteristics of this term. This was 
not the case during the second term. 
  The majority of the fourth term deputies came to the Majles 
with a specific slogan: to obey the leader and to support the 
president and the government. Another slogan was the formation 
of a calm Majles within the framework of Islamic ethics and 
supervision. Actually, these are the slogans with which the 
fourth term started its work. [passage omitted] 
  In the one year and seven months since the fourth term 
began, 
about 140 bills have been approved. I think that this is a good 
figure. Some laws were important for the country. I think that 
the fourth term of the Majles has been successful in this. I am 
optimistic about what the Majles research center does. I believe 
that the fourth term will work more expertly and more precisely 
in the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan and other 
laws. [passage omitted] 
  [MAJLES VA PAZHUHESH] Now, if you agree, we will continue 
our 
discussion on foreign policy. 
  As the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council 
and 
head of the Majles Foreign Policy Commission and because of your 
close contact with foreign political developments, please speak 
to us about the developments in the region and the world 
vis-a-vis Iran and Iran's position. Also, please state your 
views on the future and the direction things are moving, as well 
as what is being referred to as the new world order. What is 
the outlook at the close of the 20th century, and to what extent 
can economy and technology affect this situation? 
  [Rowhani] If we want to compare our current position in the 
region and in the world with our past position, I should say 
that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the manifestation of a 
well-established and strong country and that it can be counted 
on since it is a country that remains steadfast on its holy, 
revolutionary, Islamic, and national aspirations at a time when 
some countries change their face each day, each hour, and each 
month. But the Islamic Republic of Iran has shown that 
throughout the past 14 to 15 years, it has been able to 
withstand all vicissitudes. The world has realized that we are 
steadfast in our holy principles and aspirations. Also, we are 
faithful to our promises and our friendships with countries 
toward which we have extended our hand. Probably some countries 
are unable to act with the same sincerity when they are a target 
of onslaught. But the Islamic Republic of Iran has shown that 
it does not fear such tempests. 
  In their extensive propaganda, the enemies of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran portrayed Iran as a country seeking an 
opportunity to commit aggressions against other countries and a 
country seeking to interfere in the domestic affairs of others. 
But incidents during the past few years have fully proven how 
baseless this propaganda is. The Islamic Republic of Iran is 
neither an aggressor and opportunist, nor is it seeking 
expansionist objectives and it is steadfast in the principles 
that it has declared. 
  Iran's patient and friendly attitude toward the developments 
in Afghanistan, which has recently achieved its independence, 
may have been probably surprising for the world. However, 
despite its extensive borders with Afghanistan, Iran did not 
intervene in any way. Only the envoys of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran ran from one street to another amid fire and blood 
trying to establish a ceasefire and not to allow the flames of 
war to engulf the parties and groups in that country. Some of 
our diplomats were wounded in this process and some even faced 
the danger of being martyred. Even in the difficult days when 
many people left Kabul, the political envoys of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran stayed on. 
  The same situation is true in our neighbor countries to the 
north. In the Azerbaijani-Armenian incidents and in Tajikistan, 
the Islamic Republic of Iran showed that it does what it says. 
In the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has always tried to be a good mediator and to 
extinguish the flames of the war. It has never tried to exploit 
the situation, in the sense that it has never pursued its own 
interests. 
  The Iraqi case is a clearer example. This was a case of a 
country that had fought against us for eight years, a country 
that had perpetrated a series of crimes against our nation, and 
a country that confronted Kuwait, which had committed so much 
treason against our people during the [Iran-Iraq] war. But Iran 
accepted refugees from both countries with open arms. We 
accepted about 1.2 or 1.3 million Iraqis and tens of thousands 
of Kuwaitis when all border delineations had been upset, there 
were no borders, and we had a free hand to do what we wanted. 
But we did not enter Iraq. I think that the incidents and 
developments that took place around us make all those in the 
world who are clever and calculating--despite the propaganda 
that they disseminate against us--realize the truth. 
  I think that in recent years, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has fully proven its Islamic and humanitarian nature to the 
world. I consider the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
in the world to be extremely good. All the hue and cry started 
by the Americans cannot convince their friends to sever their 
relations with Iran or to stop helping Iran. This is important, 
and more important still, we see how--under such conditions when 
all this commotion is going on against the Islamic Republic of 
Iran--Europe, Japan, and others have healthy political and 
economic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is 
only natural for them not to want to leave a country that wants 
to live independently under the current world conditions--and a 
Third World country in such a sensitive area of the world at 
that--to be in peace. But fortunately, during the past 14 to 15 
years we have shown that we are completely resistant and that we 
are very used to plots and to thwarting and confronting such 
plots. 
  Others, too, have come to know us very well. Of course, I 
think that this is the first time in history that the world is 
seeing Iran as it is today. Before this, Iran was always known 
as a country that was outwardly independent, but inwardly under 
the domination of others and it was either the British, the 
Russians, or the Americans who dominated it. But the fully 
independent face of the Islamic Republic of Iran is a face that 
was seen after the victory of the Islamic revolution and it was 
the face of unity in the religious and political management of 
the country. Until the victory of the Islamic revolution, and 
especially during the Pahlavi dynasty, these two managements 
were always in confrontation. During the Qajar and Safavid 
dynasties, the situation was different. In other words, at some 
junctures in history, there has been a closeness between these 
two managements. But during the Pahlavi dynasty, the political 
management was in total confrontation with the religious 
management. The revolution was the first time that the country 
had witnessed the unity of these two and this is extremely 
important, since we see that the same person who is the 
political head of the country is also the religious head. In 
other words, the issue of the supreme leader is an extremely 
significant issue that has been stabilized in our country and 
that our people have wholeheartedly and sincerely accepted. 
  The West thinks that Iranians accepted Imam Khomeyni but 
that 
they do not accept the supreme leader. However, things were 
later clarified and the world saw that the Iranians accepted 
both Imam Khomeyni and the supreme leader today. Therefore, a 
supreme leader will always exist. Imam Khomeyni, may his soul 
be sanctified, stood out at one time in history and we benefited 
from the light that he shed. Of course, we will always make use 
of the moral light that the late leader shed on us. But his 
physical presence was only for a while. However, a supreme 
leader will always exist. Therefore, the united management in 
the Islamic country has given the Islamic world the opportunity 
for the ruler to stand next to the people. [passage omitted] 
  Whether the world wants it or not, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran rules the hearts of the people throughout the world. This 
is not like the alleged world leadership of America, which 
accepts only itself! The Americans allege leadership. But they 
are the only ones who accept this! 
  It has been proved that they are not the leaders of the 
world 
but that the Islamic Republic of Iran is undoubtedly the leader 
of millions throughout the world. And it does not make any 
difference if these countries are near us or not. Our influence 
in countries far from us is bigger than our influence on our 
neighbor countries. The influence that we have in Algeria, over 
the hearts of the people in Egypt--despite their distance from 
us--and the influence that we have on Muslims in the Far East, 
in Africa, and in the American continent may be greater than the 
influence that we have on Muslims in our neighbor countries. 
Therefore, this is a moral and genuine influence. 
  This is in answer to the first part of your question on how 
we should view the Islamic Republic of Iran at this juncture in 
history. I think that Iran should be regarded as a power, as an 
independent country, as a country where religion and politics 
and people and officials are in full coordination, as a country 
that does not intend to commit aggression, as a peace-seeking 
country, as a country that does not intend to occupy another 
country, as a country that is fully faithful to its aspirations 
and slogans, and as a country whose word can be trusted. Today 
there is no other country but Iran in the world that portrays 
such a picture. 
  In answer to the second part of your question on how we see 
the world and the new world order, I think that we should expect 
many developments in the coming years. It may seem that 
differences stemming from the existence of two superpowers in 
the world may have ended and that it is the era of a new order 
where there will no longer be a threat of war and where peace 
and justice will reign. But this is not so. In other words, we 
have not only not seen a reduction in regional wars and clashes, 
but we have also seen the occupation of one country by another 
during this era of the new order. In other words, it was during 
the era of the new order that Iraq attacked, devoured, and 
annexed another country. 
  If this new order did not exist, such things might never 
have happened. We may not have had the wars that we see in 
Europe today, a clear example of which is Bosnia-Herzegovina, as 
well as the ethnic wars that we have witnessed. It is not as 
though we can say that what we see today is a world of peace, of 
tranquility, and of a unipolar system. None of these have been 
fulfilled, and I think that they will never be fulfilled. 
  The incidents in the Soviet Union [as published] showed the 
Westerners that they cannot make a clear judgment of what will 
happen in that country. In the recent elections there we saw 
how those who put forth extremely ultranationalist slogans and 
spoke about the people's national pride got a higher number of 
votes. Even though their slogans are dangerous, the majority of 
the people voted in favor of them. 
  The elections in the Soviet Union [as published] were not a 
simple issue. It was something that may have completely shaken 
the West and made them realize that they cannot be very 
confident that the issue of a Soviet superpower has ended once 
and for all. 
  I think that new poles are being formed in the world. We see 
that the thought that in the new world order there would be only 
one pole, where the Americans would be able to act as the world 
leader and do as they please, has not materialized. I think 
that in the coming years, and especially in the beginning of the 
new century that you referred to, we will witness many rapid and 
important developments. As to what elements will play a role in 
these developments, I can list technology as one of the most 
important elements. Of course, reference can also be made to 
economy. But economic developments may also be the result of 
modern technology. 
  The issue of technology is extremely important. In other 
words, technological developments may make countries superior to 
the current powers and may lead to a complete change in the 
world situation. The world's military situation may also change 
because of technological developments. Of course, there are 
other important elements in the world. I think that the most 
important element that can influence the future of the world is 
economy in its general sense--which also includes technology and 
science--and culture, which includes ideology and religion. 
Other developments such as military, political, and social 
aspects will all be offshoots of these. 
  In today's world, technological and scientific developments 
are extremely rapid and awe-inspiring. The same applies to 
cultural developments. This very issue of the revival of 
religious thought throughout the world is an extremely important 
issue. The forecast in the world was that by the end of the 
current century there would be no such thing as religion. But 
today we see how, at the end of this century, religious thought 
has been revived and how the situation now cannot be compared 
even with the situation at the beginning of the current century. 
We will definitely witness the further expansion of such 
developments in the next century. 
  I think that the basis of the world's future developments 
will be economy and culture, and the Americans will not have the 
first say in either of these two fields! Possibly, as far as 
Japan, Germany, and so on are concerned, we can say that they 
will play the number-one role in the future economy. But as far 
as culture is concerned, we think that Islam will be considered 
an extremely important and great cultural power because we are 
now witnessing the dawn of Islam. The rays of Islam will 
undoubtedly spread in the next few years, and at the beginning 
of the new century we will witness new cultural developments 
under the aegis of these rays. 
  [MAJLES VA PAZHUHESH] Your Excellency's reference to 
technological and economic developments calls for discussing the 
fact that energy has been gradually playing a stronger role in 
geopolitical developments for the past decade. How do you 
assess this element, and how long do you think this development 
will last? 
  [Rowhani] Energy will play an extremely important role. Of 
course, a special period started in the world after 1973. This 
period concentrated on ways to replace [oil] with other 
energies. Much work has been done on this. And now, 20 years 
later, with the advanced technology that man has at his 
disposal, we should have witnessed many rapid and profound 
developments, but we have not. 
  Moreover, oil is now considered the commodity that is the 
source of many extensive developments in the various fields. 
Now we even see that aircraft manufactured with "composites" 
[preceding word in English] are stronger than aircraft 
manufactured with special steel. Therefore, in the future of 
industry and economy, oil will maintain its special place. 
  I think that the situation that the West, headed by America, 
has created for oil today is not only treason against the 
oil-exporting countries, but treason against all mankind. In 
other words, we are offering the world's most valuable 
commodity, which is also very limited, at extremely low prices. 
We are burning and destroying this commodity, and this is 
treason against the future of mankind. It is the Americans and 
the rest of the big Western powers who should be answerable to 
history for this treason. 
  It is within the context of the significance of energy or of 
black gold that Iran and, basically speaking, the Persian Gulf 
finds its special role. It is because of this role that in the 
coming century many of the countries that are not oil exporters 
will not only not be exporters, they will also have to become 
importers. 
  In the coming decades, it is possible that there will not be 
a commodity known as North Sea oil. Of course, some opinions 
are that the North Sea oil reserves will end much sooner. 
Possibly, in the first years of the next century, we will reach 
a situation in which not only will the Persian Gulf be the sole 
exporter of oil in the world, but Saudi Arabia too will be an 
oil superpower, followed by other countries such as Iran, Iraq, 
Kuwait, and so on and will be able to export oil and gas. The 
largest gas resources are in this area. Perhaps the increased 
presence of foreign powers and their arms in this region is 
because of the energy issue. 
  But we should also be wise in preserving this valuable 
energy 
resource. The Majles and the government should make plans and 
not allow this major asset to be wasted. We should have correct 
programming at home. The [Majles] research center should study 
ways that we can economize in energy consumption. As far as the 
world is concerned, the energy problem and especially the 
problem of oil will undoubtedly not lose its importance for 
years to come. 
  [MAJLES VA PAZHUHESH] The esteemed leader's emphasis on 
relations with America shows that the system strongly rejects 
political relations with America. From the point of view of 
slogans, what political and ideological logic do you have to 
offer in justification of this policy? 
  [Rowhani] Because of its historical, ideological, and 
religious roots, the issue of America is of special importance 
to our country. First of all, when we look at history we see 
that from its outset the Islamic revolution was a struggle 
against foreign, and specifically American, colonialism in 
tandem with a struggle against domestic colonialism. [passage 
omitted] 
  Therefore, we see that the struggle against America from the 
very first years of this movement was the pivotal and major 
slogan. On the other hand, the Americans too played a major 
role in crushing the revolution. We see how at the peak of the 
revolution, the American General Huyser personally came to Iran 
in a bid to crush and to destroy the revolution. Of course, we 
knew all these things at that time, and the fact that the shah 
had plans engineered by the Americans and especially aimed at 
confronting the revolution and Islam has become clearer now. 
  In his famous speech at the Feyziyeh School, which sparked 
off the 1342 [1963] movement and the 5 June 1963 incidents, his 
eminence the imam, may his soul be sanctified, told the shah: 
"Don't do whatever the Americans dictate to you. At least, 
think and see what they are dictating to you." Therefore, we 
see that this movement, which was a struggle against America 
from the very start, led to the victory of the revolution, after 
which the American Embassy's plots started. This was followed 
by the occupation of the nest of espionage and the revelation of 
documents for the world to see how from the very outset the 
Americans were working toward defeating the revolution and 
overthrowing the system. 
  Now, too, wherever there is a plot against Iran, against 
the system of the Islamic Republic, against the revolution, and 
against the Islamic movement in the world--be it in Algeria, 
Egypt, or anywhere else where an Islamic movement is seen--we 
see how the Americans play the main role in suppressing it. 
Thus, the issue of the people's enmity with America is both a 
matter of history and revolution, and of slogans and religion. 
  The Americans have always opposed Islamic thought and 
Islamic 
movement. This opposition and confrontation continues today, 
too. The imam, may his soul be sanctified, very clearly 
specified the pivotal slogan of struggling against America. Of 
course, it is true that we did not sever our political relations 
with America and that it was the Americans who severed their 
relations with us. But the imam stated his satisfaction at 
this. What did we need these relations for? In other words, 
even though the Americans started everything, both the imam and 
the people welcomed it. 
  Throughout this period, the Americans have not decreased 
their enmity even for one day. They have frozen our assets, but 
what we owed them, compared with our frozen assets, was minimal. 
Therefore, the Americans have resorted to various means to 
express their overt hostility toward us. And when they have 
entered a war against us with such hostile feelings, what reason 
is there for us to propound the issue of relations with America 
in such an atmosphere? Basically, it is not correct to propound 
this issue at all at this juncture in history. 
  I think that the esteemed leader's remarks on 4 November 
this 
year [the anniversary of the occupation of the U.S. Embassy] 
were extremely sagacious. He clearly stated all the reasons and 
logic behind his views. Reasons why we should not establish 
relations with America have always been listed, but it was 
necessary to clarify them and to give the reasoning why. 
  Our activities should be based on our national and Islamic 
interests. What benefits will our approaching the United States 
or our establishing relations with it have? It is extremely 
simpleminded to think that our problems exist because we have no 
relations with America and that if we established relations 
these problems would be solved. Undoubtedly, in our relations 
with America, we would suffer much harm and it cannot be proven 
that such relations would reap even one of the benefits that it 
is said they would yield, especially with America's current 
foreign policy in the Clinton era. 
  Basically speaking, America's foreign policy is very sick. 
Because of their many blatant mistakes and extremely childish 
behavior, the secretary of state and the National Security 
Council of America are in a shaky position. The Americans do 
many ridiculous and childish things and say that they want to 
behave with Iran in the same way that they behaved with the 
Iraqis, and that just as they exerted pressure on Iraq they will 
put pressure on Iran! Saying such things is extremely childish 
and thoughtless and shows that basically speaking American 
foreign policy is sick and unable to analyze world issues. 
  Therefore, at a time when America is our enemy and does not 
hide its enmity and at a time when our people have always been 
harmed and harassed by America, rapprochement with America will 
definitely be to our detriment. The Americans' violent 
treatment of a couple of our Navy officers on board "Iran Ajr," 
the downing of the Iranair Airbus, the destruction of the Salman 
oil platform, the Tabas incident, and so on all speak of 
America's violent and pitiless actions. For us, the Americans' 
enmity has been obvious from the Tabas incident to the downing 
of our plane and to its actions today. I think that the 
Americans are pitiless and illogical enemies and that 
rapprochement with them will definitely be to our detriment. 
  Moreover, basically, it is up to the esteemed leader to 
delineate and to determine the major and principled policies of 
the country and the system; and he has very explicitly stated 
that we have nothing to gain from relations with America and 
that such relations are harmful to us. 
  I should also add that some people think that the entire 
world is friends with America and that the only country in the 
world that is America's enemy is the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
or that all countries in the world are in love with America and 
that it is only the Islamic Republic of Iran that detests it. 
And with this type of assessment they ask: How can America, 
which is loved by everyone, be detested by you? But I think 
that this is not so. America has extremely strong military, 
economic, ideological, and cultural enemies in the world and of 
course at the top of the list of America's military enemies -- 
despite everything that is being said and despite the 
expressions of friendship -- is Russia. There are also China 
and France. From the economic aspect, America confronts Japan 
and Germany. And from the ideological and cultural aspects, it 
is confronting the Islamic Republic of Iran and revolutionary 
Islam. 
  Therefore, we can say that the Americans have many enemies. 
All the nations in the world are the enemies of America. The 
Third World is America's enemy. Actually, there are several 
superpowers that are confronting America. The military 
superpower in the form of Russia, China, and France; the 
economic superpower in the form of Japan and Germany and so on; 
and the cultural superpower in the form of the Islamic Republic. 
Therefore, it is not as though everyone else except us is 
America's friend. The tone that the others use may be different 
from ours. They may speak in a diplomatic manner or hide some 
of their intentions. But our position is clear and explicit. 
  [MAJLES VA PAZHUHESH] The truth is that the Islamic 
Republic's foreign policy has not fluctuated so much after the 
formation of the Supreme National Security Council [SNSC]. 
Please tell us about the process that led to the creation and 
to the continued existence of this council, what role it plays 
in various developments, and what it has been able to achieve. 
  [Rowhani] I think that an institution known as the SNSC is 
among the blessings that were bestowed on us with the latest 
directives that were issued by his eminence the imam, may his 
soul be sanctified, and which was created with the revision of 
the Constitution. Actually, many countries feel the need for a 
national security council after a period of war or military 
conflict. During the war, we had a Supreme National Defense 
Council. But we had to rapidly form another council known as 
the Supreme War Support Council so that it could fill the vacuum 
that existed with the absence of a national security council. 
After the war, the need for a centralized institution in which 
"politicians" and "military officials" could sit next to each 
other and adopt or coordinate military and political decisions 
was tangibly felt. On the other hand, it was necessary for the 
heads of the three powers to sit down together and to coordinate 
decisions. 
  In the Constitution before its revision, the president was 
the coordinator of these three powers. However, no mechanism on 
how to coordinate the three had been envisaged in the 
Constitution. But in the current Constitution, this 
coordination has been created with the emergence of a new 
institution in the form of the SNSC. In short, we can say that 
in the SNSC, defensive or political decisions or, in other 
words, military and state decisions on the one hand, and the 
decisions by the three powers on the other are coordinated and 
important issues that are connected with our national 
security--be they political, military, law-enforcement, 
intelligence, economic, cultural or other issues--are discussed 
and decided upon. 
  In the SNSC, the heads of the three powers; two 
representatives of the esteemed leader; and three 
political-security ministers, such as the interior, foreign 
affairs, and information ministers, are present. Also, the 
commander-in-chief, who is the highest ranking military 
official, as well as the head of the Plan and Budget 
Organization who is actually the coordinator of the country's 
economy, are also present. Occasionally other ministers are 
invited to participate when the topics to be discussed require 
their presence. 
  This council was effective in ending the differences between 
Iran and Iraq at that juncture and in freeing the prisoners of 
war as well as in settling the issue of the part of our borders 
still under Iraqi occupation. The famous letters that were 
exchanged between the Iranian president and Saddam Husayn were 
letters that had been discussed by the SNSC. These letters were 
extremely effective and important. The decision that the SNSC 
adopted during Iraq's war against Kuwait were extremely 
important. Also, the decisions that the SNSC adopted vis-a-vis 
the disintegration of the Soviet Union were also very important. 
  I should point out that the SNSC had foreseen the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union at least two years before it 
took place and had actually concluded how many countries the 
Soviet Union would be split into and what stance we should adopt 
toward it. It had even foreseen the plots that the Westerners 
and especially the Americans wanted to hatch in this region as 
many as three years before and had foreseen that world arrogance 
would one day provoke some in the area to confront Iran's 
territorial integrity. 
  Of course, it is necessary to explain that the SNSC's 
discussions and deliberations become valuable when they are also 
endorsed by the esteemed leader, in which case they are 
implemented as a compulsory decision. I think that this 
institution has been very favorable for the Islamic Republic of 
Iran.

  [Text] Majles deputies and members of the cabinet met in a 
joint session last night and discussed the country's major 
problems. During this session, both the president and the Majles 
speaker spoke about the views and stances of the cabinet and the 
Majles on the most important political, economic, and social 
problems. 
  The remarks by the heads of the executive and legislative 
branches focused on efforts to ensure the public welfare by 
compiling and executing laws, in accordance with the line of the 
founder of the Islamic Republic and the esteemed leader. 
  These two points, which were jointly stressed by the 
president and the Majles speaker, speak of the common objectives 
of the executive and legislative branches in the Islamic 
Republic. In view of these common objectives, which pave the 
way for understanding between the Majles deputies and the 
cabinet members, contacts between the members of the two 
branches can help bring their views on the implementation of 
plans closer. With these contacts, which allow the exchange of 
expert views between the Majles deputies and the cabinet 
members, and more careful help in listing priorities in the 
compilation and implementation of programs, the approval and 
implementation of laws are further accelerated. 
  Under the present conditions when discussions on the Second 
Five-Year Plan are under way and when the cabinet and the Majles 
have the approval of the 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994] 
state budget in front of them, the joint session of the 
executive and legislative branches is of significance. With the 
exchange of views between the Majles and the cabinet, modes of 
implementing the Second Plan as well as the 1373 budget bill 
will be further clarified, and the two branches can--in view of 
existing potential--compile a more applicable program that can 
overcome existing problems and fulfill the objectives of public 
welfare.

  [Text] Islamabad Jan 25 -- A section of the national press 
has reported that the Foreign Minister to have stated [as 
published] that short of the resignations of President Rabbani 
and Prime Minister Hekmatyar there can be no solution to the 
Afghan problem. It has also been reported that Pakistan agreed 
with the demand of Afghan military Commanders that both the 
leaders should resign to bring peace to their country, says a 
government handout. 
  A spokesman of the Foreign Office has clarified that the 
above reports are based on a misperception of the Foreign 
Minister's Press conference given Monday [24 Jan] before his 
departure for Tehran. The demands for resignation and otherwise 
are conditionalities attached by rival Afghan factions for 
ceasefire. The government of Pakistan has cordial relations 
with all Afghan factions and groups. It has neither supported 
nor opposed these conditionalities. 
  The spokesman added that Pakistan has pursued a policy of 
non-interference since the establishment of the Mojahedin 
government in April 1992 and feels that the use of force is not 
a viable option for resolving the Afghan problem. In the larger 
national interest, the Afghan leaders should agree to a casefire 
and initiate a political dialogue for a peacefully negotiated 
settlement. The spokesman reiterated, the Government of 
Pakistan's resolve to strengthen bilateral relations with 
Afghanistan on the basis of internationally recognised 
principles of sovereignty and non-inteference.

  [Text] Islamabad, Jan 25 -- A Foreign Office spokesman 
said here Tuesday [25 Jan] that the preliminary study of the six 
non-papers delivered by the Indian High Commissioner Mr. Lamba 
to Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan Tuesday morning indicates 
that there is not much room for high expectations in these 
non-papers. 
  The spokesman however, said that in view of the importance 
of 
the issues between India and Pakistan and as a courtesy to 
India, it was studying the papers carefully. 
  The spokesman was giving official reaction to New Delhi's 
proposals to Islamabad over the outstanding Issues between two 
countries and prospect of further dialogues. He said Pakistan 
hoped that non-papers sent to India early last week would have 
evoked similar serious response as Pakistan was now giving to 
six non-papers delivered by India. 
  The proposals sent by India include Indian suggestion to 
resolve Siachen problem, demarcation of the boundaries in Sir 
Creek area and Tulbul Navigation project controversies. 
  Much to the disappointment of Pakistan and other friendly 
countries India has not mentioned any proposals, core issue of 
Kashmir and modalities of holding plebiscite in held Kashmir 
under the UN resolutions.

  [Text] Pakistan has expressed its disappointment on the 
contents of six nonpapers [as heard] it received from India, as 
they missed the core and fundamental issues of Jammu and 
Kashmir. In his preliminary reaction to the nonpapers, the 
foreign secretary, Shaharyar M. Khan, told newsmen in Islamabad 
today we feel Indian policy is to talk on relatively less 
important issues to show the world that it is engaged in 
negotiations so that pressure of the public opinion and the 
governments is deflected from the core issue. He said none of 
these nonpapers really goes to the depth of the core issue. 
However, he said, we will consider these nonpapers very 
carefully and with the seriousness they deserved. 
  About the contents of these nonpapers, he said the first one 
related to Line of Control, suggesting to make it line of peace 
and tranquility. This proposal, he said, virtually asked 
Pakistan to accept status quo at the Line of Control. We have 
already indicated that it is not acceptable to Pakistan. The 
foreign secretary said the Indians did not refer to the question 
of repression which, in our opinion, is the real reason for 
tension in occupied Kashmir. He said in the fifth nonpaper on 
confidence-building measures, India has referred to peripheral 
issues, whereas we want to engage with India on important issues 
like nuclear proliferation -- regional or global, control of 
mass destruction weapons, control of ballistic missiles which 
India has been indigenously manufacturing, and our proposal for 
a regional nuclear nonproliferation regime in South Asia.

  [Text] Islamabad, Jan 23 -- The government will expel all 
illegal immigrants from Pakistan and will not accept any 
pressure in this regard. 
  Minister for Interior Maj-Gen (rtd) Nasirullah Khan Babar 
told the National Assembly on Sunday [23 Jan] that the 
government has decided to remove all illegal immigrants who were 
allegedly engaged in terrorist activities. 
  "We will not allow anyone to use our soil for carrying out 
terrorist activities against any country", he maintained. 
  Mr Mehmood Khan Achakzai had raised the issue in the House 
and demanded of the government to remove all illegal immigrants. 
  He was of the view that their (immigrants) activities were 
creating tremendous problems for Pakistan. 
  Maulana Fazlur Rahman, Secretary-General of JUI(F) 
[Jamiat-i- 
Ulema-i-Islam] however defended them and said today those who 
were being branded as terrorists were once declared freedom 
fighters. 
  He said that the government was taking action against Arab 
dissidents on the pressure of the US and demanded not to take 
any action against them. 
  But the Minister for Interior said there was no question of 
being lenient on the question. In this regard, he particularly 
mentioned Egypt and said Cairo was Pakistan's very good friend 
and it has raised the issue of Egyptian dissidents who were 
operating from Pakistan against Husni Mubarak government. 
  "Our government believes that these illegal immigrants are 
undesirable elements who could not be allowed to live on our 
soil", the Minister said. 
  He said Afghan Jihad was over and nobody would now be 
allowed 
to live in Pakistan without having legal documents. "These 
people should go to Afghanistan as we will not be offering them 
any refuge." 
  He further said hundreds of illegal outsiders have already 
been removed from the country and others would soon be expelled.

  [Excerpts] Speaking at a dinner with leaders of European 
Jewish communities in Strasbourg last night, Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin said that Syria has informed Israel of its 
willingness to sign a separate peace agreement, unlinked to 
agreements with other parties. Today Rabin will address a 
plenum of the Council of Europe. Gid'on Kouts reports from 
Strasbourg: 
  [Begin Kouts recording] The Syrians gave an affirmative 
reply to a question posed by an Israeli representative in the 
Washington talks as to whether an agreement with Syria will 
stand on its own two feet -- namely, be unlinked to arrangements 
with other countries or parties. The Syrians said that for 
them, such an agreement is part of a comprehensive arrangement. 
This was announced by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at a dinner 
with European Jewish leaders in Strasbourg. 
  Israeli sources said that the Syrian statement, made 
yesterday, means the Syrians are prepared to sign a separate 
agreement with Israel, a departure from the Syrian stand in 
President al-Asad's Geneva talks with Bill Clinton. After that 
meeting, the U.S. peace team reported that al-Asad made any 
agreement and normal relations with Israel contingent on the 
settlement of issues such as the right of return and Jerusalem. 
In Rabin's opinion, this is an encouraging reply reflecting a 
Syrian readiness to achieve a peace agreement with Israel. 
[passage omitted] [end recording] 
  Our correspondent adds that Yitzhaq Rabin further noted 
there 
is no room for saying that an agreement with the PLO is 
imminent. A source in his entourage was pessimistic about 
prospects for attaining such an agreement by the end of this 
week. 
  Rabin also said he did not think Jordan would be the first 
or 
second country to sign a peace agreement with Israel.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told Jewish leaders in 
a meeting in Strasbourg that Syria is now ready for a peace 
agreement with Israel that would be independent of arrangements 
with other Arab states. Israeli sources told Qol Yisra'el 
correspondent Gid'on Kouts that the news indicated that Damascus 
is ready to negotiate a separate peace treaty with Israel. 
However, a senior aide to the prime minister denied reports 
quoting Rabin as saying Syria was ready for a separate deal with 
Israel. The aide said Syria stated that a peace treaty with 
Israel would be valid no matter what happened in Israel's 
relations with other Arab countries. The aide also said that 
Rabin had received answers from Syria to longstanding questions 
about a future peace treaty.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay] </F>
  [Text] The joint government and Jerusalem Municipality 
committee of experts is recommending to the political echelon to 
try to reach a situation where by 2010 there will be 1.8 million 
inhabitants in what the government in 1987 defined as the 
greater Jerusalem area -- Bet El in the north, Hebron in the 
south, Mitzpe Yeriho in the east, and Bet Shemesh in the west. 
  The committee of experts was appointed three years ago at 
the 
government's request to plan greater Jerusalem. When two of its 
members were asked what the viability of the plan was in the 
wake of the signing of the Declaration of Principles for 
self-government, they replied that the issue is not their 
concern and that they had studied the metropolitan problems from 
an expert's point of view. Arnon Yequti'eli, head of the Meretz 
faction in Jerusalem Municipality, believes that the plan is 
part of the municipality's almost racist pettiness by constantly 
taking into account the numerical relationship between the 
Palestinian and Israeli populations. 
  There are currently some 1.2 million inhabitants in the 
area. 
The committee of experts recommends a series of moves to change 
the current demographic relationship from 55 percent 
Palestinians and 45 percent Jews, to 52 percent Palestinians and 
48 percent Jews by 2010. Jerusalem Municipality tends in 
principle to be for adopting the recommendations, with minor 
additions and changes, and hopes to convince the government to 
embrace them. 
  Two of the committee leaders, who presented the findings to 
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert this week, believe that if a series 
of moves to build in and expand greater Jerusalem -- especially 
in the areas annexed after 1967 -- are not taken quickly, 
Jerusalem is likely to become "a dead-end city" with Palestinian 
building closing in on the city from the south, north, and east, 
and blocking its ability to expand. The two, Shemaryahu Kohen, 
formerly head of the Jerusalem District in the Construction and 
Housing Ministry, and Professor Adam Mazur, maintain that 
Jerusalem will wither both in the urban and economic fields if 
large areas within the metropolitan area are not designated 
territorial reserves set aside for the town's expansion. 
  In order to achieve that aim, the two said, the committee 
recommends expanding Ma'ale Adumim in the direction of 
Jerusalem, linking it up territorially with Pisgat Ze'ev, 
linking Giv'at Ze'ev to the Ramot neighborhood, and expanding 
the 'Etzyon Bloc in the direction of the town of Betar and the 
'Adulam region. 
  The coordinator of the steering committee is Yisra'el 
Kimche, 
of the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Research, and its members 
include Jerusalem Municipal Engineer Elino'ar Brocci, Yohanatan 
Golani of the Interior Ministry, Sofia Lidor of the Construction 
and Housing Ministry, and Mikha'el Tirkin of the Israel Lands 
Authority. 
  The team proposes creating "joint Jewish-Arab zones" along 
Highway 45, between Modi'in and 'Atarot, where economic projects 
will be set up. 
  One of the team's guidelines is that political or other 
boundaries should not block the setting up of "a single voting 
area" for the population of greater Jerusalem. 
  In a letter of response sent to Olmert, Meretz faction 
leader 
Yequti'eli said that since 1967 "successive Israeli Governments 
and Jerusalem Municipality have been conducting a clear policy 
of expelling Palestinians from Jerusalem, either through mass 
confiscations of land or the destruction of hundreds of houses. 
The only approved project, the al-Nusaybah housing project, was 
also implemented because of the need to house people expelled 
from the Old City after the 1967 war and the evacuation of the 
square in front of the Western Wall. 
  "At first `we fought' over the relationship between Jews and 
Arabs in the city of Jerusalem, and when that was decided, we 
began to take stock of the numbers of Jews and Arabs in East 
Jerusalem and the territories annexed to it. We have now 
reached a clear Jewish majority there too. In fact, so much so 
that the Palestinians from Jerusalem -- tens of thousands of 
them -- have been pushed out of town and have gone to live in 
al-Ram, al-'Ayzariyah, and other places. The latest stock 
taking is over the numerical relationship in the greater 
Jerusalem area. There is no significance -- and should be none 
-- to a numerical relationship between Jerusalem and the 
Palestinian towns and villages, such as Bethlehem and Ramallah, 
which are due to come under Palestinian autonomy and the future 
Palestinian state anyway," Yequti'eli wrote.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Excerpt] Northern Command commander Yitzhaq Mordekhay has 
ordered a wide-ranging inquiry of the command and the IDF's 
[Israel Defense Forces] liaison unit in South Lebanon into how 
an IDF 155-mm shell was fired at an SLA [South Lebanese Army] 
outpost in the central sector causing the death of an SLA 
soldier and the wounding of two others. 
  Major General Mordekhay was surprised Monday [24 January] 
night when he was informed by Brigadier General G., commander of 
the liaison unit, that IDF guns were responsible for shelling 
the SLA post and the death of the soldier. The mistaken 
shelling was carried out when terrorists tried to attack the SLA 
outpost in the 'Alman-al-Shumariyah area. The terrorists lobbed 
mortars rounds and launched Sagger antitank missiles. In 
response, the IDF and SLA returned artillery fire, foiling an 
attempt to overrun the outpost. 
  The investigation has so far shown that the IDF fired many 
shells at the outpost, and one of them apparently fell inside 
the post causing the death of the soldier and the wounding of 
two others. [passage omitted]

  [Text] An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldier was slightly 
injured by gunshots fired by a terrorist in downtown Gaza. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that the terrorist, who wielded 
a Galil rifle and a copy of the Koran, called out God Is Great 
and fired at the troops. They fired back, critically wounding 
the assailant. Army and Border Police troops summoned to the 
site cordoned it off and launched an investigation. 
  Three armed fugitives, members of the Fatah Hawks, were 
captured in an undercover unit operation in Gaza's al-Shaykh 
Radwan neighborhood last night. When captured, the fugitives 
had a Carl Gustav submachine gun and two handguns in their 
possession. Their detention was followed by riots in the 
neighborhood. IDF troops detained eight local residents who 
tried to prevent the arrests.

  [Text] Israel has invested $10 million over the last few 
years to develop a nuclear power station, but the plan was 
eventually shelved due to pressures exerted by European 
environmentalists on the company intended to build the reactor. 
This was divulged by Energy and Infrastructure Minister Moshe 
Shahal, who added that the reactor slated for Israel was one of 
several power stations developed by a Swiss company and the 
German Government and $10 billion had already been invested in 
the project. The environmentalists claim these power stations 
are not safe. According to Shahal Israel will wait for a clean 
and safe nuclear technology to be developed before it 
establishes a nuclear power station. Mr. Shahal made these 
remarks in the International Conference for Nuclear Sciences in 
Tel Aviv.

  [Text] United Torah Jewry [UTJ] has submitted a motion of 
no-confidence in the government due to the desecration and 
neglect of the Jewish graves in the cemetery on the Mount of 
Olives in Jerusalem. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that 
the Knesset will discuss the motion next Monday [31 January]. 
UTJ says the desecration of Jewish graves in the Mount of 
Olives has been going on for a long time despite recurrent 
complaints to the police and Police Minister Moshe Shahal's 
promise from the Knesset podium to increase security there. UTJ 
notes that the grave of Rabbi Yitzhaq Me'ir Levin, a former 
minister of social welfare in an Israeli Government, was 
vandalized last Saturday.

  [Text] Athens, Jan. 25, IRNA -- Zionist authorities have 
imposed a news blackout on the conversion of a Jewish rabbi to 
Islam who fled to Morocco recently, Arab weekly paper 
'AL-MUSLIMUN' reported in its latest issue. The former rabbi is 
now preaching Islam in a mosque in Morocco after he abandoned 
his Jewish faith. The newspaper, published in Jeddah, did not 
mention the name of the rabbi nor when he fled to Morocco. 
  Jewish religious circles around the world are greatly 
concerned about the issue and some Zionist groups have called on 
the Zionist regime in occupied Palestine to demand the 
extradition of the former rabbi and to put him on trial for 
deserting his faith.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
first part of the Majles inquiry and investigation report on the 
activities of the Voice and Vision was read as follows in the 
Majles session yesterday, to which we call your attention. 
<H5>  Examination of the Programs of the First and Second Network </H5>
<H5>  Preface </H5>
  The Imam, may God's paradise be his, called the Voice and 
Vision the "great Islamic university" and in this way outlined 
its general direction and main mission. The Voice and Vision 
must be judged from this perspective and with emphasis on this 
principle. 
  The audience of the Voice and Vision, according to the 
explicit statement of the Imam, consists of the masses of the 
people. Hence, the Voice and Vision must in the general course 
of its cultural and Islamic movement always keep its audience in 
mind. 
  The Voice and Vision organization, especially the Vision, 
must use artistic and effective methods, such as films, serials, 
and recreational and attractive programs, in the best possible 
manner to convey its message and not be satisfied with the 
simple, primitive, low-budget conveyance of messages, such as 
speeches and direct statement of the message. One of the bases 
for judgment is to see to what extent this important medium has 
made use of effective and attractive methods to transmit its 
message. 
  The programs of the Vision can be produced in three 
ways--negative, neutral, and indifferent programming--in 
addition to programs in support of Islam and the revolution. For 
example, if the intention is to emphasize health care, this 
message can be conveyed by showing a European family and clean 
and beautiful churches or the message can be conveyed by showing 
a Muslim family with clean and beautiful Islamic mosques and in 
this way examine the constructive directions of the program. 
  The issues that will be discussed in this report shall 
consist of: 
  1) Examination of films and serials broadcast from 1353 [21 
March 1974-20 March 1975] to 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993]. 
  2) Examination of the Network 1 programs of the Vision in 
1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985] and 1370 [21 March 1991-20 
March 1992] and a comparison between them. 
  3) Examination of the Network 2 programs in 1363 and 1370 
and 
a comparison between them. 
  4) Comparison of all the programs of Networks 1 and 2 during 
these two time periods. 
<H5>  A. Examination of Films and Serials </H5>
  From 1363 to 1371, films and serials were broadcast about 
900 
times from Networks 1 and 2, of which about 700 were foreign 
films and serials produced with high-technical expertise, which 
are consequently very attractive and influential. In other 
words, a Muslim Iranian youth in the past eight years, during 
the most sensitive period of the formation of his personality, 
has been influenced by such serials, which, although they 
propagate some humane and material values, in a very subtle 
manner bring divine spiritual values under question. For 
example, in the movie "Billy Bud," the protagonist is a 
beautiful and innocent young man with certain good attributes 
portrayed, but the film explicitly states that he is a bastard, 
and while overlooking the ugliness of an illegitimate act it 
shows that the result of this heinous act is that he is a hero 
with high human qualities. There are also films that show 
educational environments, which are less harmful than other 
foreign films, but by showing coeducational schools and very 
normal emotional relationships between boys and girls in these 
schools, Iranian precollegiate male and female students who have 
been prohibited from having relations with the opposite sex 
begin to contemplate. By showing such films frequently and 
constantly, the pleasure of relationships with the opposite sex 
in a very good and progressive environment is shown to the 
student, who becomes intrigued and subsequently takes a position 
against Islam, which prohibits him from such a relationship, and 
becomes inclined towards the Western culture. He or she becomes 
disinterested in veiling; the Islamic regime becomes condemned 
in his or her mind; and his or her personality is formed in a 
manner that prepares the grounds for rejecting divine Islamic 
values and accepting decadent Western values. It was expected 
that the Voice and Vision in the course of these eight years 
would gradually increase domestic production and reduce foreign 
films and serials and even export its products abroad. But, on 
the contrary, we have been witnessing an increase in such films 
and serials in recent years. For example, from 50 foreign films 
and serials in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] we have 
reached 120 in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993]. In 1368, 41 
percent of the films and serials broadcast were Iranian, but in 
the first six months of 1371, the number was reduced to 25 
percent, and foreign serials and films have reached from 59 
percent to 75 percent. In other words, while the Voice and 
Vision is more than 14 years old, our young people benefit 75 
percent from foreign culture and 25 percent from our own 
culture. And this is provided the 25-percent domestic production 
is not under the blade of quality control. For example, the 
serial "Busy District" ridicules the revolution and the regime, 
or a serial called "Crocodile Tears" is produced at incredible 
cost, and because of certain problems of deviation, many parts 
of it are cut out, but even the parts that are shown are the 
target of widespread protest by the people because of problems 
of deviations. 
  The serials are made at high cost but have such internal 
problems that after production they are announced as unfit for 
broadcast. An example is "Ziba Beauty Salon." Some films are 
broadcast once, but because they insult Islam they are objected 
to and are deemed unfit for broadcast, such as "Haji Washington" 
and "The Death of Yazdgerd." Other examples exist which show 
that even the 25-percent domestic production that should 
eliminate the effect of the 75-percentage of foreign products 
are in some way in line with the 75-percent foreign productions. 
Of course, of the 25-percent domestic production, only 8 percent 
is produced by the Voice and Vision; the remainder is purchased 
from outside the organization. 
  A typical Iranian girl in the course of eight years has been 
affected by hundreds of models of unveiling and improper 
veiling, which have settled in her mind as positive values. 
(Foreign serials propagate unveiling and domestic serials 
improper veiling.) But, unfortunately, the high standard of 
veiled women has not been observed in films and serials in order 
for them to become interested in veiling. 
  In the serial "Hezardastan," which is considered a 
television 
masterpiece and was made at high cost, during the sensitive 
period in late Qajar rule, the deviation of the constitutional 
revolution and the government of Reza Khan to the end of the 
World War is shown. In it not only is there no sign of the 
spiritual leaders of the Muslim nation, such as Modarres and 
Sheykh Fazlollah Nuri, but also the assassin of martyr Sheykh 
Fazlollah Nuri is presented as a brave, free, sensitive, 
innocent, justice seeking, antiforeign, mystic, and patriotic 
person through cinematic tricks, whereas Khoshrevis should have 
been presented as a person hated by Islamic society. In the 
program, "The Seventh Art," where there is a discussion about 
the cinema of the former Soviet Union, the host of the program 
who is a well-known Westernized individual and has attacked 
Islam in the university environment and fought the religious 
forces, mentions the reason for the disintegration of the Soviet 
government to be regulating the activities of the artists and 
restricting their freedom, thereby implying that the artist must 
be free to create whatever he wishes and in this way tries to 
make the artists turn away from serving Islam and the revolution. 
  The same perspective has resulted in showing a naked woman 
in 
his film in a classroom. He has been teaching our students for 
years and now has been discovered by television. He has been 
invited to transmit his ideas to the whole society. 
<H5>  B. Examination of the Programs of the First Network </H5>
  An examination of television Network 1 programs during the 
one week of 25/12/1363 to 02/01/1364 [16-22 March 1985] show 
that 45 percent of all the programs were related to Islam and 
the revolution and 55 percent were indifferent to Islam and the 
revolution or were deviant. Among the programs related to Islam 
and the revolution, 55 percent were indifferent to Islam and the 
revolution or were deviant. Among the programs related to Islam 
and the revolution, 95 percent were in the form of direct 
messages, that is, speeches, news, call for prayers, and 
recitation of the Koran and 5 percent in the form of 
documentaries and reports, and no programming in the form of 
films and serials. Among the indifferent or deviant programs in 
relation to the revolution, 1 percent were in the form of direct 
messages, 28 percent in studio and report forms, and 68 percent 
in the form of films and serials. In other words, 99 percent of 
the neutral and negative messages were presented in very 
artistic, cinematic, and studio methods, while not even one case 
of Islamic revolutionary messages was presented through 
cinematic methods. Among the serials and films unrelated to 
Islam and the revolution, 64 percent were foreign and 36 percent 
domestic. Unfortunately, even in the 36 percent domestic 
production, no supervision was implemented to see that they be 
in defense of Islam and the revolution. 
  An examination of the seven years after the initial study, 
that is, during the week of 26/01/1370 to 01/02/1370 [15-21 Apr 
1991], shows that 42 percent [of the programming] was related to 
Islam and the revolution and 58 percent was indifferent to or a 
deviation from Islam and the revolution. In other words, in 
quantity, a decrease of 3 percent in programs related to Islam 
and the revolution was revealed. 
  Of course, among the programs related to Islam and the 
revolution, 20 percent were studio productions and reports and 
13 percent films and serials, which indicates a relative 
improvement compared to the previous seven years. After seven 
years, neutral programs and those that deviate from Islam and 
the revolution have progressed in quantity and quality, which is 
very worrisome. 
  On the one hand, in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985], 
Iranian films and serials comprised 14 percent of the total 
programs, whereas in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992], they 
decreased to 11.5 percent. On the other hand, foreign films and 
serials, which in 1363 comprised 24 percent of all the programs, 
increased to 38 percent in 1370. Apparently the Voice and Vision 
is gradually losing Islamic and revolutionary incentives and has 
become indifferent and neutral. 
<H5>  C. Examination of Network 2 Programming </H5>
  An examination of Network 2 programming for the week of 
25/12/1363 to 02/01/1364 [16-22 March 1985] shows that this 
network has similar percentages to those of Network 1. The 
programs related to Islam and the revolution are produced 98 
percent as direct messages, that is, at low-cost and 
ineffectively, whereas programs indifferent, neutral, and even 
deviant to Islam are higher in quantity, attractiveness, and 
effectiveness. In an examination of one week seven years later, 
that is, the week of 07/09/1371 to 14/09/1371 [28 Nov-5 Dec 
1992], we witness a decrease in programs related to Islam and 
the revolution, that is, we reach from 46 percent to 29 percent, 
while neutral and deviant programs increase from 54 percent to 
71 percent. In other words, after seven years, the share of 
Islam and the revolution in Network 2 decreases by 17 percent. 
Of the total serials unrelated to Islam, 79 percent were foreign 
and 21 percent domestic. In other words, the budget and 
resources of the televisions were spent on neutral programs and 
despite the storming cultural invasion of the enemy, television 
does not have the power to produce films and serials in defense 
of Islam. 
  Network 2 translated into Persian produced and broadcast in 
the form of television serials four plays in 1371, although the 
actors and the atmosphere of the plays were 100 percent similar 
to the foreign products; in fact, one would think they had been 
imported. At the same time, 79 percent of films and serials are 
foreign, and Network 2, instead of making films and serials in 
defense of Islam and the revolution, has acted to increase the 
number of foreign programs. 
  If we compare all the programs of Networks 1 and 2 on the 
basis of the samples in the early 1360's [1980's] and the early 
1370's [1990's], Network 1 had an increase from 45 hours of 
weekly programs to 48 hours, and Network 2 also increased from 
41 hours to 44 hours. In other words, both networks added three 
hours to their weekly programs. The share of Islamic and 
revolutionary programs decreased from 39.5 hours in 1363 to 33.5 
hours in 1370. On the other hand, indifferent or deviant weekly 
programs increased from 50 hours in 1363 to 58 hours in 1370. 
<H5>  D. Children's Programs of Television Network 1 </H5>
  Undoubtedly, among television programs, those designed for 
children are especially important, because [television] is a 
very attractive school in front of which our children sit from 
the age of five to their youth for several hours a day, even on 
Fridays. Since children's programs are all in the form of films, 
serials, cartoons, songs, and happy programs accompanied by 
music, they have a large number of viewers and are very 
attractive. In other words, the children of the revolution who 
have now reached the age of 14 have been under the influence of 
children's television programs more than any other educational 
factor. Therefore, its examination is very vital and important, 
because television can train young, faithful, determined people 
with moral virtues who are eager to learn and serve Islam and 
the people or on the contrary immoral young people who support 
the West, do not believe in Islam, and are alien to the 
revolution. 
  With this brief preface, we shall now examine the children's 
programs of Network 1. 
  Network 1, during the week of 25/12/1363 to 02/01/1364, 
broadcast a total of 15 hours of programs for children. In other 
words, on the average, two hours per day, of which 5 percent was 
direct messages, 23 percent studio productions and reports, and 
72 percent in the form of films, serials, and cartoons, which 
are the most effective and attractive kinds of television 
programs. 
  Of the total number of films and serials, 90 percent were 
foreign and 10 percent domestic productions. In other words, one 
hour of foreign cartoons were shown per day. Experts agree that 
cartoons and animations are the most attractive of programs and 
form the personality of children. Western companies transmit 
Western culture through these cartoons, which, because of the 
emotional relationship between the heroes and the children, have 
a profound educational effect. A child who was born in 1357 [21 
March 1978-20 March 1979] and was not affected by the negative 
influences of the society prior to the revolution, up to 1372 
[21 March 1993-20 March 1994], that is, in 15 years, has watched 
about 5,000 hours of foreign films and cartoons. In other words, 
he has been under the control of the Western and Eastern 
cultures, which he has watched and accepted eagerly. If we do 
not believe in the intentions of the West and the oppressors 
regarding propaganda and conspiracies in this way, we must admit 
that at least in all of these programs the culture and customs 
of the producer have been propagated and there has been no sign 
of Islam and divine values. Wine drinking, unveiling, and 
relations between boys and girls exist and are propagated in 
these cartoons to the extent that children accept them as normal. 
  Marco Polo, the European spy to the Mongol court, has been 
shown frequently as the best and most beautiful model and 
manifestation of all human virtues and emotions in the form of 
films and cartoons on television. In them, the Orient and the 
Islamic countries are shown to be barbarian and full of 
injustice, bloodshed, and backwardness, thereby presenting the 
West as the place of higher human beings and the superior race, 
which inculcates in the minds of children that the savior must 
come from the West. 
  In the attractive animation "Around the World in 80 Days," 
the main hero, who is a valuable, powerful, brave, alert, and 
ever-victorious character, enchants the children with his human 
characteristics and attributes and is explicitly introduced as 
an Englishman whose journey ends in London. If we see that our 
youths who were born after the victory of the revolution are 
inclined towards Western culture, it is because in the course of 
their lives, one hour per day, they have been shown the very 
attractive material and spiritual qualities in connection with 
the Western world in a most effective manner. And now, if the 
Islamic Republic wants to take away from them all that beauty, 
which has penetrated the depths of their being, through speeches 
and threats of judicial power, they will not only resist it and 
refuse to give up what they love, but a grudge will be created 
in their hearts towards the Islamic Republic, and subsequently 
they will not be made to understand with a few analytical 
discussions that the West threatens humanity and we must resist 
its cultural invasion. 
  The children's programs of Network 1 in the course of a week 
were 65 percent films, cartoons, and serials, but 8 percent are 
domestic puppet shows and 23 percent of studio programs, most of 
which, unfortunately, are indifferent towards Islam and the 
revolution and are in some sense international. Seven years 
after this date, from 26/01/1370 to 01/02/1370 [15-21 Apr 1991], 
80 percent of all programs were foreign films, serials, and 
cartoons. In other words, during this period, foreign programs 
were more than four times the number of domestic programs. In 
the course of this week, 98 percent of the foreign or domestic 
programs were indifferent to Islam and the revolution and only 2 
percent were in support of Islam and the revolution. 
<H5>  Examination of Children's Programs of Network 2 </H5>
  From 01/03/1362 to 31/03/1362 [22 May-21 June], 55 percent 
were domestic productions and 45 percent foreign productions. Of 
the total, 80 percent were indifferent to Islam and the 
revolution and 20 percent related to Islam and the revolution. 
Among the indifferent programs, 40 percent were effective and 
influential programs, but none of the Islamic programs were 
films, serials, and cartoons. In an examination eight years 
later, that is, 06/09/1371 to 03/10/1371 [27 November-24 
December 1992], a total of 66 percent were domestic productions 
and 34 percent foreign productions. The 11-percent increase in 
domestic production is cause for happiness. But, unfortunately, 
the increase in domestic production has not been at the service 
of Islam and the revolution, and of the 66-percent domestic 
productions, only 16 percent had Islamic and revolutionary 
messages and 84 percent were indifferent or deviant. In other 
words, compared to 10 years ago, the volume of programs related 
to Islam and the revolution decreased from 20 percent to 16 
percent; and this is due to the lack of faithful and committed 
forces in this very important medium. In fact, the main reason 
for the retrogression of the Voice and Vision and the main 
problem is the abandonment of committed forces. This trend has 
continued unceasingly in the past 10 years. 
<H5>  Report on Manpower </H5>
  In a summary of the report on manpower, the following will 
be 
examined: 
  A) The quantitative and qualitative presence of the cadre 
prior to the revolution and lack of essential change in the body 
of the Voice and Vision. The Voice and Vision is a center that 
has about 14,000 personnel, most of whom are left from the 
previous regime. Despite the fact that it has been purged, like 
other organizations, the composition of a large section of the 
organization has not essentially changed. Even the absorption of 
Hezbollah elements, due to the governing climate, has not been 
able to create fundamental change and the Hezbollah elements 
have either become dependent on the climate and transformed or 
remained silent. 
  Of course, the issue of manpower must be examined on two 
arenas, the managers and the body of the organization, 
especially in regards to artists and those engaged in audio and 
visual production. 
  In the management group, appropriate changes have been made, 
but sometimes we see inappropriate operations by some of these 
managers who have been affected by the existing climate in the 
organization. 
  Among the artists and those involved in producing audio and 
visual programs essential changes have not taken place and the 
old elements, due to intellectual opposition to the Islamic 
regime and revolution, protect the interests of their fellow 
guild members. To understand this point, several examples are 
necessary. 
  One of the known figures in the past was the host of the 
"Radio Darya" program, who had relations with SAVAK and was once 
was dismissed from Friday morning on the radio because of his 
bad temper, but was called back to work again. 
  Two of the hosts of the Voice and Vision, despite their 
justified figures on the surface, misused their situation to 
receive resources from organizations and after revelation in a 
film in which their immoral problems were shown, they were 
dismissed, but unfortunately, they were rehired by the Vision. 
  There are numerous examples of the involvement of 
questionable and anticulture programming in the Vision and 
serials. In the serial "Azarestan," an actor that was in 
offensive films of the Tyrant's time is used. He is the actor in 
the film "Mohallel," which was made with the goal of ridiculing 
Islamic values. At the present time, he is the expert and judge 
for the Center for the Performing Arts of the Ministry of 
Islamic Culture and Guidance. Other figures who are prohibited 
from acting in films by the Ministry of Islamic Culture and 
Guidance but are hired by the Voice and Vision and used in many 
serials are included in "Gol-e Pamchal," which, unfortunately, 
is produced by the Shahed group. One of them, while acting in 
this serial, was arrested by the Antinarcotics Prosecutor's 
Office for possession of opium and later released. 
  Another example is honoring the experienced actor of the 
Tyrant's time and a deputy to the monarchical Parliament, which 
occurred on 21/04/1370 [12 July 1991] in the "Journal of Art" 
programs of "Vision Week," despite the fact that he has had no 
positive artistic activity during the revolution. It can be 
argued that to honor him is to honor the art and programs of the 
Tyrant's time. 
  Another example is the official invitation to the showman of 
the Tyrant's time by Mr. Va'ezi, the director of the Voice. The 
invitation stated: "Your place is empty among the artists." Of 
course, later the action of Mr. Va'ezi was protested by the head 
of the organization, and the above-mentioned actor was dismissed. 
  The mischievous acts in the Voice and Vision that we witness 
now and then are directly related to the presence and power of 
the antirevolutionary elements and the remnants of the Tyrant's 
time. These mischievous acts are sometimes overtly against the 
revolution and Islam and sometimes subtly follow objectives that 
are hidden from the eyes of many people, some of which are as 
follows: 
  1) On 12 Farvardin [1 April], Islamic Republic Day of 1365 
[21 March 1986], a film was shown with a scene in which was the 
following dialogue: "Anyone who says yes has betrayed himself 
and his family." After investigations, it was discovered that 
the dubber had done it on purpose and it was not in the original 
text. The wife and two of the children of the dubber were among 
the organizational hypocrites, and one of his sons was 
eliminated. 
  2) Reading of a poem with an antirevolutionary content by 
the 
woman host for residents abroad. 
  3) The antireligious film "Like the Wind," for which the 
producer had received 700,000 tomans for its broadcast and was 
supposed to be shown on 29/05/1370 [20 August 1991], which was 
prevented from being shown. 
  4) Suppression and mocking of the Muslim and Hezbollah 
forces 
in the weekly "Journal of Art" program, for example, in the 
program in Mordad 1370 [23 July-22 August 1991], involving two 
good, positive films, "Fifty-Three Persons" and "Chasing 
Shadows," produced by Messrs. Yusef Seyyed-Mahdavi and 'Ali 
Shah-Hatami, efforts were made to suggest that both films were 
weak and the directors incapable and in which the martyr in the 
films was referred to as the one killed. This program was trying 
to describe and praise artistic antirevolutionary figures. 
  5) The television program "In Love With the Sun," which was 
broadcast on 07/02/1370 [27 April 1991] before the national 
news, featured the speech of a Sunni cleric who was in prison 
for having relations with foreign countries, conspiracy of 
membership in the World Sunni organization for Armed Struggle, 
and having a hand in the riots in Bandar Langeh, which resulted 
in the killing of 58 people. The broadcast of his speech 
coincided with his release and presence in the region. 
  After being informed of the incident, the grand leader, 
addressing the head of the Voice and Vision organization, said: 
"This is a grave damage. The reasons for such incidents, which 
occur every once in a while, must be carefully examined. 
Undoubtedly, the Ministry of Information must be present 
somewhere on the line of production and broadcast. Make an 
investigation of this issue." 
  Of course, despite the explicit statement of the grand 
leader, no steps were taken by the Voice and Vision to ensure 
the presence of the Ministry of Information. 
  6) The refusal of the newscaster of the day to read the news 
of the passing of the Imam and the issued announcements. Mr. 
Hayati, another newscaster, read the news appropriately, and due 
to his obvious emotional state while reading the text, he was 
ridiculed by his colleagues. 
  7) Last year in one of the children's programs the host of 
the program read a so-called educational text and mentioned two 
persons called Mas'ud and Maryam and their resistance to 
hardship, praising them and saying that, ultimately, they were 
victorious. Given the central slogan of the hypocrites, "Mas'ud 
and Maryam," the content is suspicious. 
  8) Showing of movies during inappropriate days, which was 
apparently intended to provoke society, such as simultaneous 
with the workers' strike in the Kangan Natural Gas Complex; the 
rerun of the film "Mine Workers' Strike," or from 10-25 Mehr 
[2-17 October] last year, simultaneous with the annoying 
propaganda and operations of the hypocrites, on Tuesday night, 
14/07/1371 [6 October 1992], a film about the struggles of 
revolutionary elements against the government was shown, which 
was advertised the previous nights. 
  9) Insulting the revered position of the Prophet in the 
program "Friday Morning With You," in Mehr 1371 [23 Sepember-22 
October 1992], which was broadcast as a joke from the 
loudspeaker of the Islamic regime. The first person says, I have 
heard you have claimed to be a prophet. The second one says, 
Yes. The first one says, Where is your book? The second one 
says, I do not have a book, I will have them take notes. 
  10) In one of the radio programs, an interview was conducted 
with Dr. Hesabi, the well-known Iranian physicist. Without any 
connection with the subject matter, the interviewer asked a 
question about the origin of life from the late professor, which 
cleverly negates the origin of life and the existence of God. He 
tells the late professor that he might not wish to answer that 
question, at the same time creating doubt in regards to God and 
playing with the beliefs of the listeners. Of course, the late 
Dr. Hesabi gave a biting answer based on reasoning in proving 
the existence of God and the system of the creation and 
neutralized the mischievous question of the host. 
  [11] Use of one of the actors in the serial "A Lesson to 
Learn," who was one of the actors with a bad record during the 
time of the Tyrant. The use of an actress in the same serial who 
worked in a third-rate cabaret during the time of the Tyrant, 
which unfortunately has even played the role of a companion to 
some of the infallible ones in some serials. 
  12) In 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], in a program of 
several parts on "Examining Contemporary History," which was 
broadcast from Network 2, an individual is used as a writer and 
host whose name appears in the titles and who is one of the 
active cultural elements of the Tyrant and a leader of the 
cultural opposition, who cooperates with enemy publications and 
foreign information networks, such as the BBC, and recently in a 
video interview has accused the regime of the Islamic Republic 
and the Imam of killing a number of writers of the press in the 
Islamic Republic. 
<H5>  B. Programs Outside the Cultural Policies </H5>
  The mass media plays a major role in strengthening national 
unity in every country. Especially in our country, in which 
various ethnic groups exist, the Voice and Vision is expected to 
help strengthen national unity under the present sensitive 
conditions. But, unfortunately, in the programs of the Voice and 
Vision, we see programs that are contrary to the overall 
cultural policies of the country, which by ridiculing the 
accents of various ethnic groups create problems. In most 
"Friday Morning With You" programs, the accent of Turkish 
speakers is frequently ridiculed. If attention is paid to the 
sensitivity of the Azari accent in this juncture, especially in 
the Republic of Azerbaijan, where people are sensitive, the 
negative aspect of the issue becomes apparent, or ridiculing the 
Esfahan, Rasht, and Lori accents. The latter, considering the 
report by the Central Office of Information of Lorestan, has 
caused sensitivity. This program is put together mostly by 
people who have problems. 
  There are also many programs in the foreign serials that can 
be eliminated with changes in the dialogues. For example, in the 
serial "The Secret Army," which was an attractive serial, in the 
last section, the character of the antidomination and 
antiforeign strugglers was questioned somehow and, on the other 
hand, the character of a criminal element in Nazi Germany was 
embellished. The leader of the rescue line trades all of his 
self-sacrifice for money and ownership of a restaurant... 
[sentence as published] 
  Or in the serial "The Mountain Fighters," which is the story 
of a group who have suffered injustice at the hands of the cruel 
government and was appropriate to the antioppression policy of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, the main subject of the film is 
trivialized as a result of the violence, killings, and murder 
and the excitement of the fighting, which had negative 
educational effects. Incidentally, the negative educational 
effects caused problems for the Islamic Republic, and in the 
riots of Arak in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] a large 
number of unmotivated young people who had destroyed many 
government buildings and their equipment said in interrogations 
that they were influenced by the serial "The Mountain Fighters" 
and had enjoyed doing what they did. 
  A basic criticism of the pictorial programs of the Voice and 
Vision is lack of attention to full veiling of women, lack of 
attention to the chador, and spreading the culture of the 
"manteau" and scarves of the immoral kind. If statistics of the 
serials of the Voice and Vision are prepared, it can be said 
practically no programs are devoted to veiled women with 
chadors. And if there are women with chadors, they lack 
authentic identity and positive, intelligent character. The 
women with chadors in the films and serials are portrayed 
negatively as nosey snitches, impolite and illiterate. In any 
case, such examples, whether intentional or unintentional, 
oppose the philosophy of the chador and promote improper 
veiling, the effects of which we see in the society. On the 
whole, it can be said that despite the cultural policies devised 
by the policy making institutions, in the Voice and Vision, in 
terms of reforming the society, in practice programs are 
injected into the society by the antennas of that organization 
that can be said to be serving cultural invasion in some way. In 
addition to the issue of veiling, the broadcast of popular music 
from the Voice and Vision also has caused protests by religious 
individuals and Friday imams in the Friday prayer sermons and 
has caused the elimination of the ugliness of songs by the 
Tyrant's singers [sentence as published]. 
  Films and serials that deal with the war or revolution 
usually have problems and regarding the forming of the Islamic 
revolution, the effective and main elements are either ignored 
or trivialized. On the other hand, efforts are made to show the 
influence of the intellectual elements as important and strong. 
For example, the serial "Ra'na" can be mentioned, in which the 
perspective of the filmmaker is contrary to the reasons, roots, 
determining elements, leadership, and other authentic authors of 
the Islamic revolution and in which attention is paid to the 
intellectual relations in the creation and victory of the 
revolution. Even in the titles of the films special emphasis is 
placed on the hammer and sickle of a worker, which emphasizes 
the serial appearing to be leftist. Or in regards to the imposed 
war, the viewpoint of the filmmaker generally concerns the 
examination of the social effects and second, the problems of 
the war in the society and mostly dwells on the ugliness and 
violence and in some way questions the self-sacrifice of the 
combatants, instead of showing the war from the perspective of 
the conspiracy of the oppressors against the revolution and 
engaging in the philosophy of the sacred defense and showing the 
lofty spirituality of the combatants, showing their problems. An 
example is the serial "Gol-e Pamchal" or the film "Bashu, the 
Little Stranger." Some of these films, because by nature of 
their being contrary to the philosophy and goals of the war, 
were not even allowed to be shown during the war but were shown 
after the war. 
<H5>  Management in the Voice and Vision </H5>
  Despite the fact that the managers and cultural officials of 
the Voice and Vision are among the well-known cultural figures 
in the country and on the lower levels as well the committed and 
concerned managers, especially in the various groups of Networks 
1 and 2, are the majority, the question arises as to why the 
criticisms and protests regarding the programs of the Voice and 
Vision are increasing. 
  This question can be answered in two ways. First, the 
vastness and variety in the Voice and Vision and the variety of 
audiences require a variety of programs. The phenomenon of the 
video and the necessity to fight it with programs acceptable to 
the people, the border areas, and foreign television and 
satisfying different tastes automatically causes errors. Also, 
different viewpoints and opinions concerning the programs cause 
criticism, which is sometimes proper and correct and sometimes 
illogical. Even during the time of the Imam, such different 
opinions were expressed. The example was the endorsement of 
"Autumn in the Meadow" by the Imam. 
  Second, some of the negative problems in the Voice and 
Vision 
have their roots in the influence of the culture of the Tyrant 
and the alienation of some of the managers who think 
differently. The arena of the Voice and Vision, with its 
artistic composition, has artists that are artistic and cultural 
dependents of the Tyrant, and these individuals in addition to a 
small number of managers who think differently, have prepared 
the grounds for the growth of infiltrating elements affecting 
the decisions of the Voice and Vision. By getting close to the 
directors of cultural groups and justifying their efforts, they 
influence the decisions of the Voice and Vision. These 
individuals, even in order to prevent the spread of the Islamic 
culture, under various pretexts try to sway the Hezbollah 
managers. For example, some time ago, they had convinced 
everyone that Islamic cover, that is, the chador, causes 
technical problems in front of the camera. 
  At the same time, we witness interviews with and the showing 
of faces of problematic figures who are among the most 
influential elements of the cultural opposition, or the 
participation of the editor in chief of the RASTAKHIZ newspaper 
in the seventh "Art Program." 
  The infiltrating elements can divert the produced programs 
from their main identity and direct them towards their own goals 
or cause the reappearance of actors from the time of the Tyrant 
on television. 
  In the outside-the-border unit of the Voice and Vision, 
weakness in management has caused individuals, even from the 
embassies, to operate the outside-the-border unit, some of whom 
have been spies. The manager of one of the centers last year 
made a case against four Hezbollah elements and sent them to the 
Administrative Violation Court. Their crime was the legal 
relationship between several employees with one employee 
[sentence as published]. 
  A person, who as a result of relations with deviant 
individuals, resigned from this institution and then was 
arrested, who had always had conflicts with the Hezbollah 
people, is at present the director of the Voice and Vision of 
one of the provinces. 
  The former director of the center in that province, who had 
had a record of conflict with Hezbollah elements, is now in 
charge of the office of the Voice and Vision in a foreign 
country and according to reports promotes (deviant) ideas and 
criticizes the ideas of Martyr Motahhari. 
  In making serials, much financial misuse takes place, so 
that 
with additional unnecessary scenes the cost of production 
increases greatly. 
  In 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], property of the Voice 
and Vision was stolen, and after an investigation it became 
clear that even the manager had had a hand in it. The decree 
issued concerning the manager, who was supported by the 
director, was not carried out, but subordinate individuals were 
dismissed, and after a long time, the manager was politely 
dismissed for moral corruption. Assigned to Germany but still in 
Tehran, he received his salary in foreign currency. 
<H5>  Security Situation of the Voice and Vision </H5>
  The Voice and Vision is one of the vital centers of the 
Islamic Republic, which may always be a target in various ways 
of the enemies. Its physical protection is easy, but protection 
of the personnel who are the target of influence by foreigners 
and concerning whom the organization does not have the necessary 
coordination with the Ministry of Information has caused 
numerous problems, such as visits by the leaders of the cultural 
opposition and heads of cultural invasion, employment of 
foreigners, lack of possibility for the Ministry of Information 
to control its subjects due to lack of cooperation by the 
organization while 500 of the employees have security experience 
in that ministry. Some of the individuals in the organization 
have been arrested for spying for foreigners. In short, the 
security of the organization cannot or does not want to 
cooperate with the Ministry of Information, whereas in this 
connection it will itself suffer the detriments and cause 
problems as well. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The instances that were mentioned can to some extent show 
the 
role and in a sense the power of the cadres prior to the 
revolution in the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic and 
in the same connection, the inability of the system to change 
the composition or correct and purge the ideas and thoughts of 
the program producers of the Voice and Vision is tangible. What 
has occurred in the Voice and Vision after the victory of the 
revolution are changes in high-level management, but the 
specialized affairs in the Voice and Vision and lack of elements 
who can replace the program producers all at once or gradually 
have caused the previous composition to remain as before in the 
organization and after the revolution no change being made in 
the cadre. It is interesting that the affairs and techniques 
that exist in the Voice and Vision, particularly in the artistic 
dimensions, did not attract the attention of the Muslim strata 
prior to the revolution and naturally after the victory of the 
revolution work had to be continued with the existing 
individuals. But the cadre building system of the regime suffers 
from a chronic ailment in this regard so that it has been unable 
to train an artistic, executive, and competent cadre to be able 
to gradually take charge of and monopolize the vital cultural 
and artistic arteries, especially in the Voice and Vision, and 
create a sound climate to govern the society. In the meantime, 
the official cadre building center of the Voice and Vision, the 
College of the Voice and Vision, has unfortunately been unable 
to play its essential role in absorbing and training faithful 
and sincere artistic forces to replace the old forces. Moreover, 
as it was said, due to the specialization of the profession in 
the Voice and Vision and the necessity of expertise and 
technique in audiovisual production, technical weakness can be a 
suitable excuse for preventing the growth of positive elements, 
even though the main problem is not only in this area and must 
also be sought in other areas of the Voice and Vision. In other 
words, technical weakness alone is not the cause of the absence 
of faithful forces, but the small number of faithful people, the 
change of ideas of some of our own people, and also the 
necessity of producing programs for all levels, strata, and 
tastes in the society require the Voice and Vision to accept the 
participation of and cooperation of other elements who are not 
ours. Of course, the above-mentioned indicators should not be an 
excuse to evade the grave duties and responsibilities that the 
revolution has placed on the shoulders of the officials of this 
extraordinarily sensitive organization. The element of 
management, training, and valuing faithful elements, the change 
of some existing policies and actions, the strengthening of the 
authentic beliefs and ideas of the revolution and Islam, and 
research and study of the new harmless methods of employing 
artists and experts who are not ours will have an effect in the 
change of the structure of the Voice and Vision organization, 
and in this way, the Ministry of Information in turn, and on the 
basis of the mission of guarding the values and ideals of the 
revolution, will not hesitate in rendering any sort of 
assistance. It is hoped that this brief report will be the 
source of good reform and constructive change in the cultural 
arena of the society and will not be regarded as a means to 
weaken the serving Voice and Vision organization. 
<H5>  Conforming to the Laws and the Statements of the Grand Leader </H5>
  The grand leader on occasions has given opinions and 
directives to the Voice and Vision organization or its director. 
Unfortunately, the instructions and directives of his honor were 
not implemented. For example: 
  On 02/06/1368 [24 August 1989], when, in accordance with a 
decree, Mr. Hashemi was appointed as the director of the 
organization, he was asked to rapidly prepare a bill concerning 
the administration of the Voice and Vision to present to the 
government and the Majles for ratification, which has not been 
done yet. 
  From 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] to 1370 [21 March 
1990-20 March 1991], he made reminders to the Voice and Vision 
on 14 occasions, the most important of which concern: 
  A) Misinformation. 
  B) The low level of quality of the beyond-the-border 
programs 
and failure to propagate and spread Islamic ideas and views in 
them. 
  C) The broadcast of blasphemous sentences concerning the 
Sire 
of the Pious, such as Our Sire 'Ali, which his honor wrote, and 
the broadcast by the Voice and Vision of exaggerated poems that 
are sometimes almost blasphemous must be prohibited. 
  D) The use of non-Islamic terminology, such as, May your 
days 
be for Ahura. 
  E) Showing actual persons in the role of the infallible 
imams. 
  F) The broadcast of repetitive sad and noneducational films, 
in which case it is not clear to what extent the directives of 
the grand leader are noted. 
  The Voice and Vision organization is responsible for 
carrying 
out the ratifications of the Policymaking Council. According to 
the chairman of the council, most of the ratifications have not 
been announced by the director of the organization to the 
related units and subsequently they were not being implemented. 
For example, one of the ratifications of the Policymaking 
Council was the presentation of the picture of ideal Islamic 
women. Unfortunately, in the production and broadcast of 
programs, no hopeful action or effort towards the implementation 
of the Islamic and legal policies, programs, and goals is 
observed. 
  In examining the activities of the management of the 
organization and conformity or lack of conformity of them with 
the law, we see problems indicating lack of attention to legal 
issues which are stated in Articles 1, 2, 21, 22, 23, 27, 30, 
33, 45, 46, and 62. Also, by reviewing the law of the Charter of 
the Voice and Vision organization, in comparison with the 
activities of the organization important instances of violations 
or lack of conformity to the law can be seen. According to 
Paragraph 8, Article 17 of this law, the director-general of the 
organization is responsible to report in writing the operations 
of the organization bimonthly to the Supervisory Council, and 
the Supervisory Council must report in writing the operations of 
the organization to the three branches in accordance with 
Paragraph 14, Article 16. But they have not carried out this 
duty. Also, based on Article 26, the deputy offices of the 
organization are limited to six. But without a legal permit, the 
director of the organization has added other offices. 
  In examining the two transmitters of the organization in 
Sirjan, we see lack of expertise, repetitive work, and slowdowns 
in work by the supervisory companies, the contractor, and the 
organization itself in building the short- and to some extent 
the medium-wave transmitters. Also, millions of dollars of 
equipment in boxes are abandoned in the open without protection, 
which results in significant losses to the Treasury. 
  In the collapse of the satellite [building], which crumbled 
two days after it was inaugurated by the high-ranking officials 
of the country, the events are documented in the National 
Inspection File, in which the summary of the letter of the 
National Inspection organization to the director of the 
organization and the summary of the letter of the director or of 
the organization to the director of national inspectors are 
mentioned. The summary of the letter of the National Inspection 
[organization]: The National Inspection organization, 
considering 11 reasons, has determined the issue of the 
crumbling of the satellite building an issue to be discussed and 
examined by proper judicial authorities and sent it to the 
Tehran Public Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. The most 
important reasons are as follows: 
  1) Inexperience of the implementor of the project in 
carrying 
out the project. 
  2) Failure to choose and ensure the presence of a 
supervisory 
engineer. 
  3) Weakness and failure to observe technical principles. 
  4) About 80 percent of cracks and rust in the places that 
were welded. 
  5) Nonconformity of the concrete pouring with the 
calculations of engineers. 
  6) Lack of preparing a building plan to carry out the 
project. 
  7) Existence of cracks and breakage in some of the parts of 
the building prior to the occurrence of the earthquake. 
  8) Announcement of the breakage of the windows of the 
building prior to the gradual settlement of the building and 
other reasons that are included in the file. 
  The summary of the letter of Mr. Hashemi to the director of 
the National Inspection organization: 
  He has not accepted the possibility of error in calculations 
and the possibility of failure to carefully implement the 
project in accordance with the opinion of the calculating 
engineer, regarded the crumbling of the building as the result 
of the earthquake with a vertical strike and, although he has 
accepted some errors in action by the implementor, he has not 
considered it due to ill intentions. Compared to other work done 
by the implementor, which has all been good, he has considered 
the damages resulting from the crumbling of the satellite 
building as minor and does not consider anyone guilty and 
prosecutable. The director of the organization resorts to the 
report of a group of engineers affiliated with the organization. 
He regards the report of the engineers who investigated the 
violations, the security official, and the Construction College 
of Amir Kabir University a bunch of statements heard from a 
worker's foreman. 
<H5>  Security of the Voice and Vision </H5>
  Since the existence of security in the Voice and Vision is 
very important, because this organization has always been a 
target for foreign and domestic enemies, and regardless of the 
physical security which is necessary, the existence of a 
powerful security that can oversee the actions and behavior of 
the managers and personnel of this organization is not unclear 
to anyone. Concerning the reports that reached the Investigation 
Committee regarding the managers, directors, and producers 
mainly of the Vision, about 40 of them were in sensitive and key 
positions. The committee prepared a report on their activities 
and in meetings that were held early on with the Committee on 
Administrative Violations of the organization, the 
above-mentioned committee stated that the issues that are 
mentioned in regard to the violations and incompetence of the 
individuals are verified. In numerous sessions that we had with 
the acting director of security of the organization, first he 
verified the instances in the reports concerning the 
above-mentioned 40 individuals and promised that a completed and 
approved report would be prepared from the files of the 
above-mentioned individuals for the committee. But, 
unfortunately, after nearly five sessions, ultimately no 
cooperation with the committee was provided by the security of 
the above-mentioned organization, and a number of empty folders 
that only included the birth certificate information of those 
individuals were offered to the committee, which were declined 
by the members of the committee because they were useless. 
Later, it became clear that about 150 files on violators were 
removed from the organization by the former head of security. 
  According to the investigations of the committee, the 
Security Office of the organization from 1360 [21 March 1981-20 
March 1982] on has been completely obedient to the instructions 
of the general manager, and the appointment of security 
officials did not receive the necessary approval from the 
Ministry of Information (contrary to the law), and unfortunately 
no meaningful and regular action was taken to collect 
information on the violations of individuals, or if it was done 
to some extent, so far they have avoided presenting such 
information to the Ministry of Information or other legal 
authorities. At the same time, a number of managers and 
employees of the Voice and Vision have files in the 
Administrative Violations Court or have even been dismissed from 
the organization or have violation files in the prosecutor's 
offices and there is no sign of their files in Security. 
Security is carried out upon the wish and agreement of the 
general manager. 
  The files of a number of individuals were requested from the 
general administrative director, who at first only provided the 
committee with one file. Due to the shortage of time, the 
reading of that file and other files was postponed to the 
following day. On the following day, when in accordance with a 
previous appointment coordinated with the deputy director for 
parliamentary affairs, they went to the Central Administrative 
Office, unfortunately the above-mentioned general director was 
not in his office, and later when he was asked over the 
telephone for his cooperation, he refused to do so, and even the 
files of the personnel were not placed at the disposal of the 
committee. 
  Hence, the committee through unofficial channels and use of 
tangible and intangible methods continued its investigation 
about the managers of the organization and those in sensitive 
positions. Below, mention is made of the files of a few people. 
Before engaging in the discussion, it is necessary to clarify 
the climate of the Vision of the Islamic Republic to some extent 
for the honorable audience. 
<H5>  Atmosphere of the Vision </H5>
  In numerous visits of the members of the committee to the 
various buildings of the Vision of the Islamic Republic, in the 
buildings, the outside space, the hallways, and workshops were 
unfortunately empty of any Islamic and revolutionary signs. 
Except in the rooms of a number of managers, there were no signs 
of pictures of the Imam and the grand leader and in the 
administrative offices of the warehouses, which were like those 
above, on the wall of the administrative hall, the committee saw 
the picture of a foreign female tennis player who was, 
unfortunately, playing tennis in seminaked dress. 
  All the secretaries of the organization, from the highest 
level on down, were women employees, who considering the 
relationship and contacts that these secretaries have with one 
another have an effect on the decisions of the managers of the 
organization. 
  The official veiling in the Vision is a scarf and a manteau 
and a very small number who are not seen in the organizations 
use chadors. Unfortunately, most of the sisters who had first 
gone to the organization with chadors, as a result of the 
atmosphere of the organization, have been forced to use scarves 
or manteaus. A clear example is that in the past 10 years, while 
the women newscasters of the vision all appeared on television 
screen with scarves and manteaus, when as a result of various 
pressures imposed on the organization they allowed a sister to 
report the news in full Islamic cover and chador, after the 
first session, she was attacked in the hallways of the 
organization by a number of women employees as to why she had 
reported the news in a chador. 
  1) In Esfand 1368 [20 February-20 March 1990], some of the 
equipment of the Vision organization of the Islamic Republic was 
sold on the market and by contacting the Tehran public 
prosecutor, the general manager asked that the matter be pursued 
and those who caused the theft of the property be arrested. In a 
few days, the support and technical official of the Voice and 
Vision and two other employees of the Voice and Vision were 
arrested and all confessed to embezzlement of five items 
belonging to the Voice and Vision and to drinking wine. The 
related interrogator issued the order for the arrest and they 
were forced to return the stolen property. After the arrest, 
unfortunately, the pressure and imposition by the high- ranking 
officials of the Voice and Vision to acquit the support and 
technical official of the Voice and Vision began. 
  In a letter, No. 37/189/M, dated 30/02/1369 [20 May 1990], 
the honorable general manager of the Voice and Vision thanks the 
prosecutor of Tehran and all those involved for recovering the 
property of the Voice and Vision, but, unfortunately, despite 
the fact that according to the confession of the accused, the 
logistics official was in charge and had the key to the 
warehouse, he was returned to the Voice and Vision, and the 
other accused, who have committed lesser crimes, were dismissed 
from the organization. Ultimately, the logistics official, as 
one of the managers of the organization, while retaining his 
position, was sent to Mecca for two years consecutively as the 
head of the Voice and Vision group, and on 13/06/1371 [5 October 
1992] through the office of the general manager of the 
organization, the general deputy director of the Justice 
Department of Tehran Province is informed that the Voice and 
Vision organization has changed its mind in regards to its 
complaint against the logistics official, and, unfortunately, in 
the midst of the astonishment of the employees of the Vision of 
the Islamic Republic, he is installed in an important position 
and begins to work. He has taken numerous trips to Europe, some 
of which lasted from one to three months. Due to lack of 
cooperation of the central administrative office, the details of 
the trips are not available. The file of the above-mentioned 
person has been acquired from the prosecutor's office and is 
available. In Paragraph 10, the report of the official 
authorities considers him a smoker of opium and as having 
illegitimate relations with women. 
  2) The deputy director for training of the organization 
proposed to the general manager of the organization that 
selections be made from the entering students of the college of 
the organization, which was agreed to by the general manager and 
protested by the Supreme Selection Committee and the Islamic 
Students Association. 
  The above-mentioned, who was also in charge of the ski 
federation in the winter games in Japan that were held a few 
years ago, despite the fact that the national athletic 
organization had asked the official holding the game for a man 
to carry the flag for the Iranian athletes and they had agreed 
to it, when he arrived in Japan, he insisted that like other 
countries, the Iranian flag should be carried by a woman, which 
was not agreed to by the officials of the game since they said 
that they did not have the time to train a new person. From 
Japan, a picture that he had taken with a Japanese woman was 
sent to the organization, which others saw as well. 
<H5>  Mobilization in the Voice and Vision Organization </H5>
  The following report was prepared by one of the brothers who 
served for several years in the mobilization of the organization. 
  The mobilization in the Voice and Vision organization began 
in 1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981] before the start of the 
imposed war, on the order of Imam Khomeyni concerning the 
establishment of the 20-million large army with the efforts of 
the faithful and Hezbollah forces, and no steps or support was 
made by the officials of the organization. This institution, 
with efforts and initiative and use of policy and ingenuity in 
all cultural, military, administrative and financial areas, has 
been able to gain a suitable position in the organization and 
become trusted by the employees of the organization. From the 
beginning of his arrival at the organization, the director of 
the organization has not had any favorable view of the 
organizational work of the mobilization in the organization and 
has not made any contacts. In the few contacts with him, 
whenever there has been talk of the organization and financial 
needs and resources, he has somehow passed by the issue and 
relied on superficial slogans and matters. In connection with 
making an appointment with him to discuss problems, it would 
sometimes take a year, and after a lengthy pursuit, he would set 
a limited amount of time. At the end of a session, there would 
be no moral and normal support for this institution, but 
weakness and regret. In regards to the resources of the 
mobilization, by making use of appropriate situations and 
establishing relations with low-level managers, we have been 
able to acquire rooms and other resources. On several occasions, 
the head of the organization has issued written instructions to 
take away all the resources from the mobilization. Considering 
the waste and excessive expenditures of the organization, so 
far, after 13 years not 1 rial has been paid to brothers working 
in the mobilization as salary, bonus, or benefits, and 
essentially he does not consider the mobilization as a permanent 
and favorable organization within the organization, but as a 
secondary and even troublesome one, but he does not have the 
courage to say it openly. 
<H5>  Report on the Voice and Vision College </H5>
  The Voice and Vision College operates in a rented building, 
which resembles a residential place, and in the course of 15 
years since the revolution, no steps have been taken to build a 
suitable college. 
  Also, due to the shortage of funds the educational equipment 
is so old and worn out that it is not suitable for teaching and 
does not have a good return. In Zibakenar, a place has been 
projected for teaching that is mostly like a recreational 
coastal complex and is not appropriate for an educational 
environment. The library of the college in terms of location, 
books, and allocated funds is not appropriate with the goals of 
the organization and training of students. It can be said that 
research in the college is nonexistent. 
  Management: In the organization of the college, a board of 
directors has not been projected, and the president of the 
college is selected by the educational deputy of the Voice and 
Vision. Except for the technical manager, who has a doctorate, 
the rest of the managers have masters degrees. Even though in 
terms of the current operation of the affairs there are no 
problems, due to the great mission of the Voice and Vision 
organization, and in terms of scientific planning and technical 
knowledge, higher educational degrees are required to run the 
scientific affairs of the college. 
  Since the college is under the direct supervision and 
specific policies of the educational deputy director of the 
organization, it is necessary to see who is the highest 
authority of decision making and direction for the training of 
the most important cultural and artistic strategies of the 
country. 
  The educational deputy director of the organization was 
first 
in charge of the facilities in the technical division of the 
organization. His specialization is electricity. Then he was put 
in charge of developmental projects, including the building of 
the Satellite Building, which crumbled two weeks ago and could 
have been one of the bloodiest accidents of the revolution, 
because two days prior to the crumbling, all the foreign 
ambassadors, attaches, and high-ranking representatives along 
with the high-ranking officials and, most important, the 
president and general managers of the Voice and Vision gathered 
in that building. He implemented the project of the Zibakenar 
Villas, which in order to avoid disgrace called it an 
educational center, but in practice remained recreational and 
became a shelter for the rich employees of the organization, so 
that while the country was being threatened, they could swim and 
have fun there. Many problems occurred there, including the 
drinking of wine, not observing veiling, lack of control over 
mixing men and women during swimming. 
  He regularly travels abroad under various pretexts and is 
especially interested in Japan. His harsh and offensive dealings 
with the Hezbollah brothers and sisters are known throughout the 
organization. His de-Islamization in his area of activities is 
evident in the statistics on the dismissal of religious and 
committed individuals and the compulsory transfer of some of 
them, putting environmental pressure on institutions such as the 
Guard Corps, 15 Khordad, etc., giving orders to remove the 
pictures of martyr Dr. Beheshti from the walls, and other cases. 
  The educational officials mostly have a reactionary 
bureaucratic attitude in regards to the educational deputy, lack 
of control of uncensored films for students, the existence of 
connections instead of regulations, harsh and offensive behavior 
towards students, inattention to the training of students, 
discrimination in giving service to students, disregard for 
distinguished professors, etc. 
  Mr. H., the educational deputy of the organization, believes 
that the college is attended to, that a long-term human model is 
being prepared and published, and admitting students will be on 
that basis. [sentence as published]. 
  The Voice and Vision College is one of the most costly and 
in 
terms of resources one of the best colleges in Iran. Mr. 
Hashemi, the general manager of the organization, says: We give 
the necessary value to the college, to the best of our ability. 
In terms of the student-teacher ratio, it is better than at 
other colleges. Educational resources and equipment are at a 
desirable level, but the limitations due to the problems of the 
country naturally affect the situation of the college. The 
center of all the problems of the Voice and Vision, including 
the college, is shortage of funds. 
  Considering the great role of the organization, which is 
itself a university as large as Iran, overall planning for the 
next 20 years and preparing suitable manpower is extremely 
important, because we know that without providing the suitable 
and competent work force, any practical planning will be 
neutralized in the future. 
  The professors have not been hired through the 
administration 
for the selection of professors and therefore are not subject to 
the existing definitions in higher education with regard to the 
members of the faculty. This has caused them to despair and in 
this connection to be deprived of study leaves. 
  Among the professors, we see Easternized and Westernized 
individuals who, considering their intellectual and 
psychological characteristics, ridicule the Hezbollah forces and 
drag them into isolation and boycott in various ways. For 
example, Ms. S.A. has spoken so much in the class about marriage 
and the problems of married life that she has attracted the 
attention of the boys; or Mr. B. in one of the sessions has 
tried to prove the necessity of suicide in some junctures in 
life and said that Takhti committed suicide. Some professors 
have come from places where their competence has not been 
approved. 
  Students generally complain about the shortage of student 
aid, the climate of the village, the library, courses, cleaning 
the cafeteria and dormitory, lack of attention to prayers, lack 
of a place for washing for prayer for the sisters, etc. 
  The next session of the report on the inquiry and 
investigation will be in tomorrow's issue.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs 
Division.med&gt; 
  The Majles held an open session yesterday. The open session 
started later than usual and for this reason the pre-agenda 
speakers did not speak. Then the speaker of the Majles honored 
the anniversary of 13 Aban [4 November], the anniversary of 
fighting the United States, the details of which were published 
yesterday. Then the Majles went into session and the 
continuation of the inquiry and investigation concerning the 
activities of the Voice and Vision was read from the Majles 
podium. We call to your attention the details of the discussion. 
<H3>  Second Part of the Inquiry and Investigation Report of the 
Majles Concerning the Activities of the Voice and Vision </H3>
<H3>  Report on the Financial Situation of the Voice and Vision of 
the Islamic Republic of the Islamic Republic </H3>
  Despite the lack of cooperation of the auditor of the Voice 
and Vision with the committee, the Inquiry and Investigation 
Committee succeeded in reporting the financial situation of the 
organization by collecting correct information and making use of 
the efforts of the accounting office. 
  According to the law of the charter of the Voice and Vision 
organization, which was ratified on 27/07/1362 [19 October 1983] 
by the honorable Majles, some of the duties and authority of the 
Supervisory Council are determined as follows: 
  1) Examination and approval of the annual budget of the 
Voice 
and Vision, which is proposed by the general manager. 
  2) Examination and approval of the annual report on the 
activities, the balance sheet, and the profit and loss account 
of the organization and affiliated companies. 
  The general manager of the organization is responsible and 
must respond to the Supervisory Council and must carry out all 
the ratifications of that council. 
  The general manager of the organization must present the 
list 
of the activities of every fiscal year of the organization and 
the related balance sheet concerning the affiliated 
organizations before the end of Khordad [21 June] of the 
following year to the Supervisory Council, and the council is 
responsible for giving its opinion by the end of Tir [22 July] 
every year in regards to the financial operations of the 
previous year with attention to the inspection (auditing) report. 
  On the other hand, according to Article 138 of the general 
accounting law of the country, the Voice and Vision is 
considered a government company none of whose financial lists 
and those of its affiliated companies have been approved and 
ratified by the Supervisory Council since 1361 [21 March 1982-20 
March 1983]. 
  The reforms and changes were merely done based on the 
opinion 
and approval of the management and even without consulting the 
Supervisory Council, the position of "internal auditing," which 
operated under its supervision and as a control and supervisory 
unit, was eliminated in 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] and 
instead the evaluation and financial operation unit under the 
supervision of the General Financial and Auditing Affairs Office 
has been created. In fact, it has acted as a government 
institution (and not a company). 
  Essentially, the management of the Voice and Vision since 
the 
beginning has not regarded itself as a company in practice. An 
example of it is preparation of an accounting list of revenues 
and expenditures instead of a profit and loss account. Hence, 
even though the organization until the end of 1367 [21 March 
1988-20 March 1989] has had 16,500,891,339 rials[Rls] annual 
profit (more than the capital), it has never included the taxes 
of the company, even though the financial operations of the 
organization are carried out as a company. It has always wanted 
to have full authority of a government establishment, as a 
director. This kind of thinking is current in the whole body of 
the management of the organizations. 
  After the revolution, the operations of the organization 
have 
not been inspected, audited, and examined by any authority and 
merely have been signed by the general management of the 
organization by preparing financial lists by the auditing office. 
  The budget of the organization is in a centralized form and 
the current budget proposed by the organization (expenditures) 
for 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] has been estimated to be 
Rls41,565,609 thousand [as published] (without including 
Rls10,771,768 thousand [as published] of the proposed 
expenditures that will not be put at the disposal of the 
organization). Also, the foreign currency budget needed by the 
organization is projected to be $60,675, for which (resources) 
Rls800,000 are from special revenue sources and the rest from 
government help. Whereas the special revenues of the 
organization in 1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989] were more 
than Rls2 billion and in the years 1368 and 1369 [21 March 
1990-20 March 1991], nearly Rls3 and Rls4 billion, respectively, 
it has always been reflected less in the budget projections in 
order to increase aid received by the government. 
  Because of the special system governing the Voice and 
Vision, 
the accounting body has only examined the General Accounting 
Unit that has the current account and there is no information 
concerning the activities and nature of the accounts of the 25 
radio and television centers and other Tehran units. 
  It can be seen that the ratified budget of the main line of 
the organization in 1368 was exactly the same as 1367, but in 
1369 and 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992], compared to 1368, 
has had a growth of 60.5 and 84.55 percent, respectively. Also, 
the ratified developmental budget of the organization in 1368 
had a growth of nearly 25 percent compared to 1367 but more than 
95 percent and 200 percent compared to 1369 and 1370. In any 
case, in 1368, the total revenues of the organization were 
Rls29,444,646,071 and the total expenditures Rls20,874,859,703, 
and consequently has had a loss of Rls1,430,213,632. 
  In 1367, even though the level of government help compared 
to 
1368 has increased by more than 60 percent, the difference 
between the revenues and expenditures was only Rls1,823,100,378. 
  The losses in 1367 also were Rls463,167,783. It needs to be 
explained that the accumulated profit of the organization at the 
end of 1366 [21 March 1987-20 March 1988] was Rls17,197,705,389. 
By including the losses of 1367 and 1368 and the profit of 1369, 
the difference between revenues and expenditures (in fact 
accumulated profit of the organization) at the end of 1369 was 
Rls16,500,819,339. 
  The remainder of the account of miscellaneous debtors to the 
organization at the end of 1368 was Rls13,090,910,232 and the 
balance of the accounts of debtors of advertisements to the 
organization at the end of 1368 was Rls562,360,017. Hence, the 
balance of the account of the debtors to the organization at the 
end of 1368 was Rls13,653,270,349, which is precisely 5 percent 
of it, that is, Rls682,663,512 in reserves for questionable 
accounts receivable. 
  In examining the activities of the Tehran unit, it can be 
seen that the balance of the account of miscellaneous debtors is 
Rls3,033,254,198, and the balance of the accounts of 
advertisement debts in the Tehran unit was totally 
Rls3,459,475,420, which is about one-fourth of the total 
remainder of the debit account of the organization. 
  In examining the auxiliary accounts it can be seen that 
there 
were many false and fabricated figures. Especially in pursuing 
the matter it becomes clear that the nature of many of the 
figures in the accounts are unspecific and concern the years 
prior to 1361, which cannot be verified. These kinds of figures 
are transferred into the books without any action, as before. 
Hence, even though the audit of the committee concerned 1368, 
because the above- mentioned organization has not been audited 
and examined after the revolution and because of not 
understanding the nature of the financial activities of the 
organization in the past years, in most cases the extent of the 
investigations by the committee had to be mostly 1361 [21 March 
1982-20 March 1983] to 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] and in 
some cases also include the years prior to the revolution. 
Naturally, access to the documents and books of the past years 
was not without problems. 
  In any case, in the auxiliary accounts of miscellaneous 
debts 
to the Tehran accounting unit it can be seen that for the 
Central Bank, Rls1,789,491; five different branches of the Melli 
Bank, a total of Rls40,967,058; and the Commerce Bank, Bazaar 
Branch, Rls5,114,500 were owed the organization due to the 
differences in the account and the financial officials of the 
Vision confess that because the accounts of the banking system 
of the country are correct and are prepared daily, naturally 
such differences are to our benefit. Nevertheless, no 
appropriate steps have been taken to eliminate them. 
  The Physical Fitness organization owes Rls60 million for the 
sale of an athletic field, whereas no such transaction has taken 
place at all and the check is at the disposal of the legal 
office of the Voice and Vision. 
  Since 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] the Pars Auditing 
Institute has owed Rls4,500,000. If the above-mentioned 
institute has not carried out the duties conferred on it, why 
has the organization not taken any steps to receive the auditing 
report or the amount owed it? And if the above-mentioned 
establishment has done the duties conferred on it, why have no 
steps been taken so far to correct the account (changing it to 
expenditures)? And there are many cases that indicate debts by 
government organizations and establishments, which were 
transferred in the books precisely, and it is not clear to what 
extent and at what amounts these accounts are falsified. 
  At the end of 1368 (and also 1369), the Telefilm Company 
owed 
Rls265,292,225 to the organization. 
  With a brief examination it becomes clear that according to 
document No. 600, dated 31/06/1360 [22 September 1981] 
(concerning the transfer of the remainder of 1359 accounts), the 
258,407,086-rial balance of the prepayment account of the 
above-mentioned company has been transferred from 1359 [21 March 
1980-20 March 1981] and ultimately according to document No. 
8095, dated 27/12/1364 [18 March 1986], the balance of the 
prepayment account of the above-mentioned company has been 
corrected by Rls265,292,225 in the debit account (which has been 
shown 30,000 less in the auxiliary account) and since that time 
have been transferred in the books exactly. The explanation is 
that in none of the documents of the years examined is the issue 
of prepayments clear. 
  It should be added that at the end of 1364 [20 March 1986], 
some of the prepayment accounts of establishments and 
individuals have been corrected in the miscellaneous debit 
account. Because of various reasons (including that he was not 
the official at the time and knows nothing about it) the 
financial affairs officials presented no explanation in this 
regard, and the opinion of the committee is that those debts 
were not determined to be collectible. 
  The list of actual debtor individuals is very long and 
heavy. 
Among those who owe over Rls1 million to the organization, 58 
cases have been identified, including: 
  The general manager of the organization at the time of the 
Tyrant owes Rls3,097,669, as well as other individuals 
affiliated with the previous regime who have had no relationship 
with the organization after the revolution and the legal office 
of the organization has taken no steps to collect the debts. 
Only the auditing office transfers these debts in the books year 
after year. 
  Another person owes the organization Rls100 million. After 
investigations, it became clear that he had sold two pieces of 
land to the Voice and Vision in 1357, and the ownership of the 
lands was transferred to the Voice and Vision officially and 
buildings were also constructed on them. Nevertheless, during 
these 15 years, the Voice and Vision has yet taken no steps to 
correct the account and eliminate the debt of the 
above-mentioned person. 
  In examining the nature of the debt of individuals, various 
cases can be cited. For example, one man owes Rls10,373,502, 
including a loan for Rls400,000 received in 1358 [21 March 
1979-20 March 1980] from the special fund and budget. In 1360 
[21 March 1981-20 March 1982], for returning an illegal secret 
bonus, Rls192,000 has been removed from his debt, the balance of 
the debt being from before the revolution, the nature of which 
is not clear, and from 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] no 
action has been taken to collect it and only the balance of his 
debt has been transferred in the books. 
  The debt of a person from 1361 for Rls59,066,644 (apparently 
his debt is in connection with the release of goods), which has 
not yet been settled, and so forth. 
  Another owes Rls9,353,774 since 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 
1984]. A cursory examination clearly reveals that the balance of 
his prepayment in 1356 [21 March 1977-20 March 1978] was 
Rls7,740,776 and in 1357, Rls750,000 as a car loan and also in 
1358 other amounts for his travels and telephone bills abroad 
have been included in his prepayment account. In 1360, upon the 
request of the Purging Council, the amount of Rls1,093,000 was 
included as a return of an illegal bonus to his account and 
ultimately the balance of his prepayment in 1362 was transferred 
to the debtors' account, and from then on, the organization has 
taken no steps to collect the debt. 
  An employee of the organization owes Rls7,438,251 from 1361. 
If this amount of debt is real, why is it not deducted from his 
salary and benefits or fees for producing programs? And there 
are many other cases. 
  An examination of the account reveals that debts of the 
organization to some individuals concern prior to 1353 [21 March 
1974-20 March 1975] or some individuals in the accounts are owed 
several million rials by the organization. If this is true, why 
has no step been taken to collect it? For example, two women and 
one male employee working in the organization are apparently 
owed Rls4 million, Rls2 million, and Rls1.5 million, 
respectively. The nature of these debts (of the organization) is 
unclear. In this connection, the financial officials say that 
because the organization is comprised of units, an individual 
may owe one unit and then transfer to another unit where he 
deposits his debt, but since the reason for the deposit was 
unclear, it went into his credit account in the new unit. 
Unfortunately, we heard a great deal of this kind of 
explanation, and no decisive steps have been taken. 
  The balance of the revolving funds account of the 
organization (with the main code 115) at the end of 1368 [20 
March 1990] was Rls290,563,476. Whereas the funds for the 
emergency expenditures of the units and also to the purchasing 
agents in accordance with the bylaws and at a maximum amount of 
Rls500,000 can be paid (according to the bylaws, the funds of 
the organization can be increased up to this amount with the 
written permission of the auditor), and the accounts payable 
must be settled at the end of the year, about 22 persons owe 
more than the amount of Rls500,000 in funds received. Of course, 
in some of the units, including the Tehran accounting unit, 
transfer the deposited and unsettled funds at the end of the 
year in the miscellaneous debit account to deep up appearances. 
  Some cases are also seen in which the amount of the accounts 
payable exceed the allowable level, including one man who 
received 1,500,000 in funds. According to the bylaws of the 
funds of the organization, if the amount of the funds exceeds 
Rls300,000, it is necessary to acquire a promissory note in the 
amount of the funds signed by the receiver as a guarantee made 
out to the organization, whereas the promissory note from that 
person is Rls500,000. Considering the remainder of the revolving 
funds of the person from the previous years, the balance of his 
account at the end of 1369 [20 March 1991] reached 
Rls17,377,457, which is absolutely contrary to the nature of the 
revolving fund account, or to another person, Rls2 million in 
funds was paid, and there are other cases. 
  The balance of the fund account of Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, the 
general manager of the organization (the present director), from 
1364 [21 March 1985-20 March 1986] to 1370 [21 March 1991-20 
March 1992] has been calculated and is mostly in foreign 
currency, but no steps have generally been taken to deposit or 
settle them. For example, one item in the amount of Rls4,500,000 
for procuring 400 Spring of Freedom coins for New Year gifts and 
bonuses for employees were recorded in early 1369 (he received 
the coins in late 1368), but after that year, it is still not 
clear to whom these coins were given. The balance of his 
account, with the code 125, at the end of 1369 was Rls7,521,337. 
  The balance of the funds account of the organization (with 
the main code of 111) at the end of 1368 was Rls26,449,598 and 
the balance of the above-mentioned account in the Tehran 
accounting unit was Rls11,595,749, which is the balance of the 
accounts of three cashiers, and also 20 Spring of Freedom coins 
(10 of them are in the form of invoices), which were transferred 
from 1364 [21 March 1985-20 March 1986] and so far no steps have 
been taken to settle it. 
  During the change of cashiers, usually there are 
discrepancies in the accounts. For example, one cashier in the 
first half of 1369 handed his cash box to another, and according 
to the auxiliary book, he owes Rls2,773,904, but he claims that 
he owes Rls94,665. Because of such discrepancies (which are 
evident in other accounts of the Voice and Vision in many 
instances) no essential steps have been taken to eliminate the 
discrepancies in the accounts and settle the debts. 
  Payments from this fund are made, including the 
reimbursement 
of 80 percent of health care for the employees, which according 
to the existing bylaws is the responsibility of the 
organization. But in some cases, the organization accepts all 
the treatment costs of the employee. Among them are the 
documents in 1368, Nos. 254, 200, 867, etc., for which no 
justification has been offered. 
  At the end of 1367, the balance of the accounts receivable 
was Rls1,223,195, which was closed with the account of creditors 
and next year was reopened exactly the same way. The reason was 
the failure to record some of the payments to the cashiers in 
the books. So far, there has never been any control over the 
collections and payments of the cashiers by the Auditing Office 
and the list of the number of funds has not been prepared. 
  The remainder of the prepayment of the organization in 1368 
was Rls3,159,855, which includes three main accounts. 
  Prepayment to (official) employees with the main code 123, 
at 
Rls509,256,414. 
  Miscellaneous prepayments (to nonofficial and 
nonorganizational persons) with the main code 124, at 
Rls1,224,855,591. 
  Prepayment of programs with the main code of 125 (concerning 
the Unit for Program Affairs), at Rls1,425,743,811. 
  The remainder of the first two accounts in the Tehran 
accounting unit are Rls187,239,742 and Rls362,464,551, 
respectively. In the above-mentioned accounts, the assignment 
fees, treatment fees, partial payment on salaries, some loans, 
and other debts of the individuals are recorded. 
  In a brief examination of the prepayments to employees, we 
see that in 1368, there were about 5,000 people who had 
prepayment accounts, of which about 4,000 cases at the end of 
the year had a debt balance and about 705 remaining credit and 
the rest had been settled. In order to understand the nature of 
the accounts, some examples of the balances above Rls1 million 
were chosen and examined. 
  The remainder of the prepayment of Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, 
with 
the code 12300153, at the end of 1368 was Rls5,546,263, and at 
the end of 1369, Rls9,471,963, which were mainly put at his 
disposal as extra payments in rials in the equivalent of foreign 
currency for assignments abroad in the form of funds for his 
expenditures, and so far no steps have been taken in regards to 
reports on the assignment or presenting documents of 
expenditures to settle the foreign currency funds, which have 
been requested frequently by the Central Bank. In addition, some 
of the prepayment accounts of Mr. Hashemi related to the 
calculation of the price of 500 Spring of Freedom half coins 
were given to him in accordance with document No. 6761 in 1361 
[21 March 1982-20 March 1983] and also 300 Spring [of Freedom] 
coins were given to him in 1369 in accordance with document No. 
7849, and so far he has taken no steps even to settle the 
account of the assignments that took place several years ago. He 
has not even yet requested the list of those who received the 
coins and has not calculated the cost even from 1366 [21 March 
1987-20 March 1988] All these problems and weaknesses are due to 
the fact that the auditor of the organization has always been an 
obedient employee of the organization rather than being assigned 
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance. 
  The balance of the prepayment of one of the gentlemen with 
Code 12325063 at the end of 1368 was Rls2,689,414. Most of these 
payments were for extra pay for assignments abroad at $130 per 
diem and foreign currency payments to him in funds. Since the 
assignments, the management of the organization in regards to 
the verification of the assignments or the auditor has not taken 
any step to receive the documents of expenditures to settle the 
foreign currency funds. He has had numerous long-term 
assignments to visit radio and television centers in foreign 
countries, visit exhibitions, and inspect the Voice and Vision 
offices abroad and of course mostly for treatment of his 
illness, including eight documents regarding 1364 to 1369 at a 
total of $27,600 for traveling to China, Japan, England, 
Germany, Istanbul, Damascus, Beirut, and Larnaca. On some of 
these travels, which were for medical treatment, he was 
accompanied by his wife and child for treatment. 
  The balance of the payments of a woman at the end of 1368 
was 
Rls356,454. In following up the nature of this payment and 
examining document No. 6565 of 1368, it can be seen that 
physicians under contract with the organization requested the 
management of the organization to participate in the annual 
conference in San Francisco in connection with infertility 
research and also requested that that woman, due to a long 
history of infertility and the opposition of the Medical 
Council, be sent to the United States. She was sent abroad, 
along with her husband, and they each received $3,500 for 
treatment. 
  In examining the documents of expenditures deposited in Nos. 
4820 and 4833 in 1369, it can be seen that the Ministry of 
Health has opposed sending the above to the United States and 
agreed to send them to Australia, provided they receive no 
government foreign currency and go there with personal funds, 
whereas the organization took steps to send them on official 
assignment for 50 days, with a per diem of $100. Because the 
Central Bank has paid only $70 of the per diem due to foreign 
currency restrictions (a total of $7,000) in accordance with its 
internal regulations, the organization has paid the difference 
between $70 and $100. 
  In later investigations we found documents that indicate the 
sending of medical teams abroad, including to the United States, 
to participate in research seminars and courses. For example, 
Mr. J., the head of the Voice and Vision, along with nine other 
physicians, including Ms. F.K. (naturally not all of them 
specialize in female problems) and one engineer (considering 
that this was an engineer and not a physician, most likely he, 
is a relative of one of the doctors, because he went abroad 
several times) went to Australia for 57 days to take part in 
medical research in connection with infertility and an inability 
to get pregnant, whereas the head of the medical delegation and 
another person were in the United States during this time. These 
individuals have had no employment relationship with the Voice 
and Vision and are merely physicians under contract with the 
organization and are not involved in the organization for the 
development and progress of medical science to go on such 
assignments abroad. 
  As a rule, in the Voice and Vision, there are many 
assignments abroad for particular individuals, which are not 
very much related to the duties and the mission of the 
organization and take place under various pretexts. Apparently, 
even as New Year bonuses and rewards, individuals are sent on 
assignment abroad. For example, let us consider the case of Mr. 
M D., the administrative and financial director. According to 
four documents from 1366 to 1368, he has traveled to England, 
Germany, and so on, receiving $4,355. 
  And at the end of the audit, that is, at the new year 1371 
[21 March 1992], also he was on assignment abroad. There are 
only a small number of his assignments abroad that were seen in 
a brief examination of the records. Usually he goes on 
assignment abroad several times a year to inspect the offices of 
the organization. 
  A contract employee had requested from the management of the 
organization that due to a problem with his hand that he be 
assigned for 25 days to Sweden and England and while being 
treated, carry out the necessary studies to purchase 
premanufactured parts in those countries (document No. 4910, 
dated 16/05/1363 [7 August 1984]. Also, according to document 
No. 7676, dated 21/07/1363 [13 October 1984], he also had an 
assignment in Germany for about 20 days. From examining the 
documents, it is clear that on these assignments the main issue 
was medical examination and treatment and spending several 
thousand dollars for treatment, with the work of the 
organization being secondary. 
  In 1368, an eight-member group was given an assignment 
abroad 
for 53 days to purchase films (document No. 3455). The cost of 
their tickets was Rls3,157,600 and extra pay for their 
assignment $38,720. Some of the members of the group were not 
officials of films and related affairs, including the director 
of general affairs and programs affairs (who worked earlier in 
the auditing unit) and due to his position sometimes received 
large funds as bonuses in connection with serials. 
  In some cases, the routes of going and returning were quite 
different and the reason has been mainly to visit relatives in 
foreign countries. 
  In any case, in the continuation of the auxiliary prepayment 
account of the employees, it must be said: 
  The organization signed a contract with an individual to 
design and carry out the mechanized informational system from 
15/05/1365 [6 August 1986] for three months for Rls2,800,000, 
which was paid to him in three installments. Considering that 
his work was approved by the representative of the organization, 
nevertheless, the amount of the agreement remains in his debit 
account. Also, he had no employment relationship with the 
organization. Nevertheless, according to documents Nos. 1755, 
2648, and 2868 of 1365; Nos. 6768 and 4033 of 1366; No. 8163 of 
1367; and No. 2189 of 1368, he had gone on assignment abroad. 
Also, according to document No. 4654 of 1368, he went to Geneva 
to receive a British visa and returned after 15 days with no 
results. 
  The remainder of the prepayments of another person at the 
end 
of 1367, the amount of Rls3,061,400, was determined in the 
examinations of the committee that in 1367 he received Rls3 
million as partial payment for treatment, which he has not yet 
deposited. Nevertheless, document No. 5493 was requested from 
the document files, which was not found, according to the file 
clerk, while the committee was there. 
  The remainder of the prepayment of another at the end of 
1369 
is Rls2,064,555. In the examination of the books of the past 
years it becomes clear that this balance has been recorded in 
the books from 1362 (and certainly before it, since it was not 
possible to pursue it further). 
  Two other persons, a man and a woman, have a 
prepayment-balance total of Rls3,226,000, which was transferred 
to the books from 1361. 
  The balance of the prepayment of a man, Rls1,020,426, was 
transferred in books from 1361 and it was not possible to 
investigate it any further. But, apparently, in 1356 he caused 
the unintentional murder of a person and to pay compensation, he 
was given a loan of Rls1,000,000 by the organization, which has 
not been deducted from his salary in installments so far and no 
steps have been taken to settle and deposit it. 
  The balance of the prepayment of six others is 
Rls11,886,000. 
<H5>  Miscellaneous Prepayments Under the Main Code of 124 </H5>
  The above-mentioned auxiliary account includes 1,490 items, 
of which 220 are credit balances and 1,225 debit balances. As 
was pointed out earlier, in the above credit account, 
Rls8,998,232 are the result of errors in accounting operations 
and weaknesses in the financial and supervisory system of the 
organization and such accounts must at least be corrected, 
because credit in property items cannot be justified, including: 
  Four persons with a credit balance of a total of Rls797,000. 
  And other cases [exist], of which 19 cases were in excess of 
Rls100,000 and are included in the detailed report. Fifty-six 
cases of the above-mentioned debit account balance are over 
Rls500,000, which have been chosen and examined as samples. The 
general conclusion was that most of these debts were transferred 
from earlier years and no steps were taken to settle and deposit 
them. An explanation must be made that in order to pursue this 
matter, we were obliged to check the books of the previous years 
(usually until 1361), which was not free of problems because of 
the accounts being computerized and codified and sometimes the 
change of the password or the change of the people's names in 
the books, such as one year the person was registered as 'Ali 
Fazel and the next year as Fazel 'Ali, or the name Hasan was 
written Hoseyn or Mohsen and being certain of the correctness of 
the account and the person in question. 
  The summary of the results are as follows: 
  Eight employees owe a total of Rls14,913,000. 
<H3>  Balance of the Organization's Deposit Account With Others 
(With the Main Code of 126) </H3>
  At the end of 1368, it is Rls156,822,133 and the balance of 
the above-mentioned account in the Tehran Accounting Unit is 
49,780,278. In this case, it must be said that some of the items 
were not deposits by nature and necessary steps must be taken to 
correct the account, including: 
  The amount of Rls820,000 in 1360 for release of purchased 
tapes to the West Tehran Customs was paid, which was transferred 
in books until the end of 1370. Have the tapes not been released 
yet? 
  The amount of Rls500,000 in 1363 for the life insurance of 
wage earners sent to the war was paid to the Iranian insurance 
company, which every year is transferred to the next year's 
books. Has the war not yet ended? 
  In 1366, for permission to broadcast the World Cup Soccer 
[Touranment], Rls13,222,391 was paid to "I.B.U.," some of which 
was returned in 1368. Hence, the amount that appears to be a 
deposit in that establishment was 4,501,315, which was 
transferred to 1370. After several years had passed since the 
broadcast of these soccer games, the auditor has had no time to 
correct that account and include it in the expenditures. And 
there are other similar cases. 
<H3>  Balance of the Account of Deposits of the Persons in the 
Organization (With the Main Code 213) </H3>
  At the end of 1368, the amount of Rls33,501,671 and the 
remainder of the above-mentioned account in the Tehran 
accounting unit was Rls12,884,941. In this case, it must be said 
that from companies that give service to the Voice and Vision, 
such as Behpurkam Company and Atiyeh Company, instead of 10 
percent usually 5 percent is deducted to do their work well. Or 
in 1364, for participation in the bidding for release of goods, 
Rls1,600,000 were collected from various companies, which has 
remained in the accounts in that form and no necessary steps 
were taken. 
  In an examination of the discrepancy current account 90024 
of 
Melli, Afriqa Branch, in the name of the Tehran accounting unit, 
it can be seen: 
  Check No. 038906 in the amount of Rls60 million in 1366, 
according to document No. 6172, made to the Physical Education 
organization for purchasing a piece of land for athletics has 
been recorded in the books, which reappears as an item at the 
end of 1368. After following up the matter, it became clear that 
because no transaction has taken place, the Physical Education 
organization has not received the check at all, and it is at the 
disposal of the legal office of the Voice and Vision. Hence, to 
eliminate the above-mentioned discrepancy and return from the 
debtor account of the Physical Education organization, rapid 
steps must be taken. 
  Checks have been issued to various individuals as wages, 
etc., in the previous years, which as open items show 
discrepancies in the list and most probably were not given to 
the individuals, because the auditing office mistakenly records 
the documents before the checks are given out. In any case, 
considering that the checks are only valid for a maximum of six 
months from the date of issue, the usual steps must be taken to 
eliminate the open items of 1365 to 1366. 
  Some individuals who have had no official and employment 
relationship with the organization have received loans and after 
leaving service, the guarantors were asked for the installments, 
but the guarantors have in some cases said that they should not 
pay compensation for the person they have guaranteed for 
humanitarian and other reasons, and hence the management of the 
organization has excused such loans and included them in 
gratuitous aid (as an example, document No. 5416 in 1368). 
  In some cases, the deficit of the funds of individuals has 
been included in the expenditures account of the organization. 
Considering that these individuals are paid guarantees and also 
extra funds every month, any sort of deficit must be included in 
the accounts of the individuals and not the organization. 
(Examples are documents Nos. 2044 and 2902 in 1368.) 
<H5>  Program Affairs Unite (Code 21) </H5>
  The balance of the prepayment program account of the 
organization at the end of 1368 was Rls1,425,743,811, which is 
related to the Tehran Program Affairs Unit (including 391 
auxiliary accounts). 
  This sort of prepayment is deposited mostly in the personal 
account of the financial supervisor (or producer) for payment of 
some of the costs of production of the programs, and because the 
financial supervisor is an employee of the Voice and Vision, no 
guarantee is taken for it. Sometimes at the end of the year, 
they are not settled and are transferred to the prepayment 
accounts of the employees. If the contract is for making and 
delivery, all or some of the expenditures are accepted by the 
producer, and in this case, based on the contract, the 
installments are paid in proportion to the volume of work done. 
  The main problems of the above-mentioned account is not 
settling the payments after the serial of a program is 
completed. By examining 82 above-mentioned auxiliary accounts, 
which compose nearly 94 percent of the total balances, it can be 
seen that despite the production and broadcast of programs and 
serials from the Voice and Vision, still various individuals are 
in debt due to those serials and programs, and no settlement of 
the account has taken place. For example, one of the producers 
of the serial, "Hezardastan," which was produced several years 
ago and broadcast on television, still owes Rls358,875,891 and 
Rls271,974,014. Another, for building the township for "The 
Silk Road" (preparing sets for Old Tehran to be used in the 
"Hezardastan" serial and other serials), owes Rls105,505,352, 
which has been transferred to 1369 without any steps being taken. 
  A person may owe for several programs. For example, a 
producer for producing "Haji Washington" movie (which was 
determined unsuitable for broadcast, and this is itself a 
problem) owes Rls15,571,414. 
  For the serials of "Mirza Kuchek Khan," "The Wolves," etc., 
which have been broadcast over television, still some 
individuals owe millions about the settlement of which no action 
has taken place by the auditor and the management of the 
organization. 
  Mr. A.N. (producer of the serial "War and Life") and Mr. 
A.S. 
(his financial supervisor) owe Rls104,500,000 and Rls1,000,000 
for prepayment of a program. The above-mentioned serial 
according to the estimates should have been completed by the end 
of 1367 [20 March 1989], but apparently, due to the financial 
inability of the producer, the above-mentioned serial was left 
incomplete. 
  The deposit received from a person for a serial called 
"'Aqiq" was Rls2,700,000, and the collected guarantee documents, 
Rls3,000,000, whereas his debt for this amounts to 
Rls43,100,000. 
  The remainder of the account of miscellaneous debts of the 
programs affairs at the end of 1368 was 45,007,955, which is 
related to 20 actual and legal persons. For example, according 
to a contract in 1367, the amount of Rls4,076,700 was paid to 
the Iranian Statistical Center to prepare and devise the map of 
the city of Tehran. The contract should have been completed in 
the second half of the same year, concerning the settlement of 
which no step has been taken. 
  The remainder of the temporary accounts of creditors in the 
programs affairs at the end of 1368 was 277,557,453. Some of the 
auxiliaries of the above-mentioned accounts have been 
transferred from previous years until 1370 without any steps 
being taken to settle the account. For example, Rls266,000 owed 
to Mr. M.Y. has been transferred from prior to 1363 to 1370 in 
the books. The documents and books prior to 1363 are not 
available in the filing office of the above-mentioned unit. 
Hence, it seems that some of the cases in the above-mentioned 
account are fraudulent. For example, individuals and 
distinguished persons have had scholarly and religious speech 
programs in the Voice and Vision without asking for fees. The 
organization has included some amounts in their credit account 
and hence such accounts have had to be transferred to the 
subsequent years. Some of the credits, too, are for including 
bonuses, fees, etc., in the accounts of individuals in which 
cases, too, many of the accounts have been transferred to the 
following years and the reasons are not clarified. Some cases 
are also due to correcting the accounts. For example, the 
remainder of the creditor of the prepayment account of the 
employees has been transferred to the above-mentioned account 
and corrected or the deposit of the debt of individuals, instead 
of being included in their prepayment credit, have been 
mistakenly recorded in the credit of the above-mentioned 
account, and hence the remainder of the prepayment, debit and 
credit accounts must be compared and adjusted in order to 
determine the cases and eliminate them and in this way reduce 
the futile volume of the above-mentioned accounts. 
  Actual debts of the organization (or credit of others) are 
only in cases when the organization has received funds for the 
making of films or offering other services, and it is not clear 
whether or not it has acted on its obligations or the 
above-mentioned accounts have not been corrected. For example, 
credit to the Oil Company, the Forestry and Pastures 
Organization, the University Jihad, etc., for the amounts of 
Rls4,770,000, Rls3,500,000, and Rls3,125,568, etc., for making 
films, printing, and copying of slides. 
<H5>  Program Expenditures Account </H5>
  In the Voice and Vision organization, the expenditures 
accounts are [numbered] from 501 to 599, which are closed as a 
temporary account at the end of the year in terms of profit and 
loss. The above-mentioned expenditures at the end of 1368 were: 
  Cost of materials, Rls329,234,803. 
  Cost of salaries, benefits, and wages, Rls18,791,325,023. 
  Other expenditures, Rls11,757,299,877. 
  The total is 30,874,859,703 [as published]. 
  But a series of expenditures have the special codes 601 to 
699, of programs which are being made that are regarded as 
permanent accounts and included in the balance sheet. In other 
words, the expenditures for the making of every program are 
transferred from year to year and in the year that the 
production of the program is completed, the total expenditures 
of the program are transferred to the expenditures account with 
code 600 and closed with the idea that the expenditures of the 
programs that in the course of production are considered a sort 
of property and in the year of completion and broadcast of the 
program are turned from being property to expenditures. This 
method of accounting is not desirable, because expenditures are 
in any case expenditures and the production of a part of a 
program is not considered property because it cannot compensate 
for the expenditures that have been done. With this method, the 
fiscal period of accounting from one year is changed into 
various years of production of every program, which is contrary 
to the accepted accounting principles and standards. Hence, the 
profit and loss of every year is not calculated realistically. 
Therefore, if in one year there are several costly serials under 
production but have not been completed and accounts are not 
settled, these expenditures are not reflected in the profit and 
loss list. If the goal of determining and calculating is the 
cost of the making of every program, the special file of every 
program can be recorded as the expenditures made for every year. 
  The above-mentioned expenditures at the end of 1368 are: 
  Cost of materials for the programs under production, 
Rls228,720,924. 
  The cost of salaries, benefits, and wages during the 
production, Rls143,495,762. 
  Other costs in the course of production, Rls3,111,688,466. 
  A total of Rls3,483,905,192. [as published]. 
  In examining the expenditure accounts of code 600, it can be 
seen that the production cost of serials that were produced and 
broadcast prior to 1368 have not yet been transferred to the 
final expenditure account, code 500, including: 
  Expenditures of code 600 for the "Hezardastan" serial, 
Rls2,648,590. 
  Expenditures of code 600 for the serial "Mirza Kuchek Khan," 
Rls672,459,000. Expenditures of code 600 of the serial "The 
Wolves," Rls132,374,735. 
  Expenditures of code 600 of the serial "The Neighbor's 
Shadow," Rls65,861,026. 
  The important issue in this case is that the programs were 
not produced during the projected periods. Because of these 
delays, the organization has been burdened with great costs for 
maintenance of the resources during the halt in production and 
also due to inflation. For example, in examining the file of the 
serial, "Mirza Kuchek Khan," it can be seen that the initial 
estimate in 1363 was Rls436,202,600 and due to lack of proper 
planning, the estimates are regularly corrected and the 
financial burden of the organization increases. For example, the 
expenditures for the period of shut down and halt in the filming 
of the serial from 29/01/64 [18 April 1985] for four months was 
Rls48,500,000 and in Amendment 5, the total estimate was 
ratified for Rls709,442,940, that is, it has had more than 
92-percent cost increase compared to the initial estimate. 
  Essentially, amending estimates has been done after the 
expenditures were made and the date of most heavy projects both 
because of financial expenditures or the method and time of 
production is always coupled with dissatisfaction and disorder. 
The director, producer, and manager of the project (the 
implementor of the project) are usually changed in large 
projects. The initial director of the serial "Mirza Kuchek Khan" 
was Naser Taqva'i. In the second phase of filming Behruz Afkhami 
was introduced as the director. Or the manager of the project 
was changed during the production of this serial, and such 
actions increase the cost of production. 
  Initial estimates of the serial of "Ra'na" on 18/10/1367 [8 
January 1989] within the framework of eight 60-minute segments 
at Rls80,641,968 and the amended estimate on 04/12/1369 [23 
February 1991] within the framework of seven 46-minute segments 
has been Rls119,066,724. In other words, despite a 33-percent 
decrease in the time of the serial, the cost has increased by 
nearly 50 percent compared to the initial estimate. 
  The important issue is that many of the serial segments 
after 
production were not considered suitable for broadcast. For 
example, the "Hezardastan" serial was produced in 23 segments, 
and although every segment was approved by the related 
management and has a receipt from the archives, after completion 
and due to changes in management, personal tastes, and lack of a 
clear policy, only 10 segments of it were considered suitable 
for broadcast. And the "Haji Washington" serial was not 
considered suitable for broadcast at all. 
  In examining the expenditure documents of the 
above-mentioned 
serials, it can be seen that: 
  Purchases are mostly without receipts and only are included 
in the account with the approval of the financial supervisor and 
the project management. 
  Invoices of the expenditures are mostly without the seal, 
signature, and an address. 
  Entertainment expenditures are large. The total 
entertainment 
expenditures for "Mirza Kuchek Khan" were about Rls73 million. 
  Despite the very good transportation equipment of the Voice 
and Vision, mostly private agencies are used to transport actors. 
  For every serial, large bonuses, even to individuals who 
were 
not connected with the serial, are given. The total bonuses paid 
for the "Mirza Kuchek Khan" serial were more than Rls10 million. 
<H5>  Central Accounting Unit (Code 11) </H5>
  The above-mentioned unit combines the financial operations 
of 
the Tehran units and centers and in fact is the financial 
representative of the organization with the government and the 
Treasury. Preparing the budget, receiving funds from the 
Treasury, and distributing them among the units and centers and 
ultimately organizing the financial lists of the organization 
are the duties of this unit. 
  The miscellaneous debit account, which is one of the main 
accounts of this unit, which at the end of 1368 had a balance of 
Rls6,961,103,521, was paid to them after the guarantee funds, 
but the deposit procedures were not made clear to this 
committee. It needs to be explained that in the Voice and 
Vision, an employee can receive loans from various sources and 
for various reasons: From the future security and retirement 
fund of the organization, based on 8 percent of the base salary 
of the employee share and 16 percent of the organization share, 
the housing savings fund (5 percent of the monthly salary of the 
employees share and 10 percent organization share), cooperative 
savings fund (2 percent of the base salary of employees share, 
and 16 percent of the organization share), and other aid by the 
organization to the above-mentioned funds from a percentage of 
the revenues from advertisement, etc., and ultimately from the 
current budget of the organization. 
<H5>  Salary and Wages Accounting Unit (Code 13) </H5>
  To briefly examine the above-mentioned unit, the committee 
tried to examine the banking accounts, but usually faced the 
absence of the director of the unit (Mr. H., who because he has 
a private company and other work and also due to lack of control 
of the entry and exit of employees in the building on the Africa 
Expressway for which reason the employees often delayed the 
transfer of this division to the main building on Jam-e Jam 
Street, most of their time, especially that of the managers, is 
spent outside the work environment) and lack of cooperation of 
his deputy (Mr. F.P.), a retired person who has been called back 
to work. In any case, as an example, Document No. 344, dated 
30/03/1368 [20 June 1989] in connection with the fees for the 
services of managers was requested, which later only with the 
permission of the head of the unit was placed at the disposal of 
the committee. The amount of Rls4,421,257 in accordance with 
Document No. 1633, dated 21/04/1368 [12 July 1989], of the 
Tehran accounting unit (which is the expenditure unit) has been 
included in the annual profit and loss account. The 
above-mentioned document is one of the fees for service payments 
of 38 persons (mostly managers of the organization) who have 
worked on a project called the Committee for Designing the Work 
Force Model in Esfand 1367 [20 February-20 March 1989] to 
Farvardin 1368 [21 March-20 April 1989]. 
  First, only the share of fees for services in Esfand 1367 
can 
be included in the annual profit-and-loss account and the share 
of Farvardin must be included in the current expenditures of the 
organization. 
  With a brief examination of the checkbook for 1370 of 
Banking 
Account 90042 of the unit and the wages, large figures are seen 
as overtime pay and bonuses to some individuals at about 30,000 
to 80,000 tomans. In connection with 1368, document No. 7012 
indicates this situation. Because the financial operations of 
the organization is unit by unit, some individuals apparently 
receive overtime pay or bonuses in every unit. For example, at 
the end of 1370, a man had received bonuses of 10,000 to 12,000 
tomans in five units. 
  Second, the basis of calculation of the work hours of 
individuals in the above-mentioned project is after 14 [2 pm ?] 
on, that is, two hours prior to the end of official time. 
  Third, the fees for services per hour are calculated on the 
basis of 10 percent of the monthly salary, for which there is no 
legal justification. 
  Fourth, the taxes are calculated at 5 percent, whereas they 
must be calculated on the basis of taxes on salaries and 
benefits. It is noteworthy that the above-mentioned project 
ultimately was presented as the master's degree thesis of one of 
the officials of the College of Administrative Sciences and 
Business Management. At present, he is living abroad. 
  As a rule, in the various units of the organization, 
particular persons carry out the delayed work of that 
organization under the heading of projects and in this way 
receive fees for services. For example, in the auditing office, 
the project for the mechanization of the financial system was 
headed by a retired person from the organization who every month 
received large amounts for his services as the head of the 
project (other people are also involved in this project). This 
project started three years ago. Or the project for delayed 
accounts of the Salaries and Wages Unit and certainly other 
projects, which have not been examined can be found (which is a 
part of the Salary and Wages Accounting Unit). It can be seen 
that so far a discrepancy banking list has not been prepared for 
the above-mentioned account to the point that according to the 
balance on 30/09/1370 [21 December 1991] of this accounting 
office, the above-mentioned bank shows a credit balance of 
Rls735,674,634, whereas the bank balance must always be a debit. 
In a brief examination of the above-mentioned banking account, 
it can be seen that in 1368, according to document No. 2760, 
dated 30/10/1368 [20 January 1990], three 500-million-rial items 
(a total of Rls150 million [as published]) has been deposited to 
this account from the retirement fund, and according to document 
No. 2278, dated 30/09/1368 [21 December 1989], on the 
instruction of the auditor, three 500-million-rial savings 
accounts have been transferred to the Melli Bank's, Africa 
Branch. Considering that the deposit document has been recorded 
in the books a month after the payment document, this situation 
itself shows the weakness and inability of the above-mentioned 
accounting office. Deposit and payment of the above-mentioned 
funds are evident in the card [as published] of the related 
bank. According to document No. 2790, dated 30/10/1368, one of 
the deposits has been withdrawn, of which Rls200 million has 
been deposited in the retirement fund and Rls300 million in 
account No. 90032. The withdrawal from the above-mentioned 
savings account was with the signature of the head of the 
retirement fund and the head of the Salaries and Wages Unit. But 
in this case, according to the statements of the head of the 
retirement fund, the director of the bank, due to his 
acquaintance with the head of the Salaries and Wages Unit and 
without informing him, has withdrawn the above-mentioned 
deposits. (Due to lack of precise accounting in the accounting 
office of the retirement fund, the documented record of the 
withdrawal and the other two deposits were not found.) 
Ultimately, another Rls200 million was deposited in the 
retirement fund account and Rls1,200 million to the auditing 
account, while the fate of the other Rls100 million is unclear. 
According to information, the above-mentioned amount is at the 
disposal of the manager of the companies under the control of 
the organization, but it is not recorded anywhere. The head of 
the employees retirement fund expressed lack of knowledge in 
this connection and said that he was against it from the 
beginning. The head of the retirement fund was asked, for what 
reason were these funds used to open the savings account and for 
that matter not directly but through the savings funds bank. He 
says that it was the order of the auditor. 
  On the other hand, it was decided that the head of the 
retirement fund should present the latest balance and documents 
that show the above-mentioned operations. Later, when members of 
the committee went to see him, they could not because he was in 
meetings or absent. The head of the accounting office of the 
Fund also due to the emphatic instruction of the head of the 
funds not to present any information to the committee has 
excused himself and has only said that no books are kept in this 
connection, and meanwhile by transferring this division to the 
glass building on Jam-e Jam and moving the documents, the work 
was left incomplete. 
<H5>  Result of the Report and Opinion of the Auditing Committee </H5>
  Lack of an organized accounting system suitable to the goals 
and activities of the organization, imposing various tastes in 
regards to the units and centers and lack of an experienced and 
expert cadre has caused the methods used not to respond to the 
needs of the organization and also not to guarantee offering the 
necessary information in regards to the activities of the 
organization. 
  By combining the trial balance sheets of the units and 
centers, in fact, all the activities of the Voice and Vision 
will be unified and the financial operations will be centralized 
in one accounting system. Nevertheless, this combination will be 
only in the financial lists and not in the details of activities 
and operations (auxiliary accounts). 
  The design system of the structure of the Voice and Vision 
is 
the so-called divisionalized form [preceding text in English], 
which due to complexity and extreme decentralization causes 
problems for auditing. Hence, in such structural systems, 
outside control can hardly work and the operations of the 
organization must be supervised by strengthening internal 
controls as much as possible. This is very weak in the Voice and 
Vision. 
  In connection with the production of programs, no control 
system exists to be relied upon in auditing. Moreover, no 
satisfactory method exists for the auditors to be able to prove 
the completeness of the financial records of the program. For 
this reason, the auditors have not been able to obtain all the 
information and explanations that they considered necessary and 
subsequently being sure of the accounting and financial history 
and its accuracy in regards to most accounts as well as being 
certain concerning whether or not the views of the legislature 
have been observed in the activities of the Voice and Vision was 
not possible. 
<H3>  Brief Statements of the Speaker of the Majles After the 
Reading of the Inquiry and Investigation </H3>
  We hope in future inquiries and investigations that the 
gentlemen take into consideration the situation of the Majles, 
those who will listen to it, and the agenda of the Majles and be 
able to prepare the report in a more concise and summarized form 
in order for us to be able to attend to our other work and for 
the program of supervision or inquiry and investigation to 
preserve its credibility. 
  Regarding the fact that the gentlemen (deputies) will decide 
what will happen to the results of the inquiry and 
investigation, I must say, we will act in accordance with the 
bylaws. Inquiry and investigation is based on the bylaws. The 
inquiry and investigation is read and announced from the podium 
of the Majles. Up to this point, it is the duty of the Majles. 
  The second item on the agenda of the open session of the 
Majles yesterday was a report by the Planning and Budget 
Committee concerning the urgent bill to amend Note 3 of the 1372 
national budget law, of which the single article was ratified.

  [8 Nov pp 14, 15] 
  [Text] News Service. Following the publication of the 
critical report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group of the 
Majles on the activities of the Voice and Vision, the public 
relations office of this organization sent a 31-page response in 
answer to the first part of the criticism of the Majles Inquiry 
and Investigation Group, the full text of which is as follows. 
<H5>  Response [Part I] </H5>
  Because there are many nonfactual points and ambiguities in 
the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, which was 
read on 11 and 12 Aban [2, 3 November] in the Majles, in order 
to clarify matters for the public, especially the honorable 
deputies of the Majles, we declare the errors and accusations as 
follows. Before entering the discussion, it is necessary to make 
a few points by way of a preface. 
  A) The issue of inquiry and investigation: 
  1) The procedures for the absorption and employment of the 
revolutionary, Hezbollah forces in the organization. 
  2) The activities of the honorable director of the Voice and 
Vision organization, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, and the procedure for 
the selection of subsequent directors and their activities in 
spreading Islamic culture, in accordance with the ratified 
policies of the organization. 
3) Procedures to conform the programs of the Vision with the 
standards of the sacred religious law. 
  4) Reason for broadcasting scenes from the Vision of the 
Islamic Republic that show Western culture and result in the 
creation of an unsuitable model among various strata, 
particularly the young. 
  The members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group were Mr. 
Movahhedi-Savoji, Dr. Hasan Kamran, Mr. Seyyed 'Ali Akbar 
Parvaresh, Mr. Mohammad Reza Mavalizadeh, Mr. Mohsen Kuhkan, Mr. 
'Ali Yusefpur, and Mr. Lotfollah Zare'i-Qanavati. Holding more 
than 50 official meetings, this group spent more than 150 hours 
and ultimately in the session on 19/05/1372 [10 August 1993] 
approved the report with a majority vote. 
  The points of the Voice and Vision organization concerning 
this part of the report are: 
  The management of the organization finds it necessary to 
thank all the self-sacrificers of the organization who in the 
course of eight years of the imposed war and the bombing of 
cities, with their active and unassuming presence on the front 
lines of the battle front and offering dozens of martyrs and the 
broadcast of thousands of hours of war programs, immortalized 
the epic resistance of our brave and courageous people. In the 
inquiry and investigation report, not only is no mention made of 
this, but also with hurtful sentences it interprets all that 
effort and self-sacrifice as lack of solidarity with the war. 
  1) During the first days of the formation of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group, even before the decrees had been issued 
officially by the honorable speaker of the Majles, or at least 
the copy of the decrees had not been sent to this organization, 
Mr. Movahhedi-Savoji in a written invitation invited the 
director of the Voice and Vision organization to take part in a 
meeting of the group. 
  The director of the organization went to the Majles at the 
appointed time to take part in the meeting. Upon his arrival, it 
became clear that the members had not expected the presence of 
the director of the Voice and Vision. The understanding was that 
the invitation had been extended for the presentation of a 
written document, but no cooperation ensued, and from the 
members of the group only five persons were present at the 
meeting. Mr. Movahhedi-Savoji expressed his thanks and 
announced: Since we did not know whether you would attend or 
not, some members, such as Mr. Parvaresh, went on a trip and 
some were not informed. 
  In any case, after the usual pleasantries, Mr. 
Movahhedi-Savoji, as the chairman of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group, asked Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, the director of 
the Voice and Vision, to make a statement. 
  In this meeting, thanking the Inquiry and Investigation 
Group, Mr. Hashemi made the following points: 
  1) You know that during his life the Imam paid special 
attention to the Voice and Vision, and, according to the 
supplement to the Constitution, it is operated under the 
supervision of the grand leader. Therefore, it has always been 
the organization closet to the religious guardian and leader. 
  2) The Voice and Vision, as the mouthpiece of the Islamic 
revolution, has numerous supporters and opponents. 
  At the head of the supporters of this medium are the Imam, 
God rest his soul; the grand leader; the honorable officials of 
the regime; the Hezbollah nation; and the Muslims of the world, 
and at the head of the opponents of this medium are the 
counterrevolutionary groups and those damaged by the revolution, 
such as the hypocrites, the leftist minigroups, the Hojjatiyeh 
Society, the supporters of the United States and Israel, the 
monarchists, etc., who have frequently tried to destroy this 
organization under various pretexts. 
  3) Even though inquiry and investigation is one of the 
duties 
of the Majles, it is an issue that is judiciary by nature, and 
in the Islamic judiciary system, the most important 
qualifications of the judge are that he be just and impartial. 
Unfortunately, with the presence of Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh in 
the Inquiry and Investigation Group, given his past history in 
the Hojjatiyeh Society and the opposition he expressed from 1361 
[21 March 1982-20 March 1983] with regard to the management of 
Mr. Hashemi, and especially in the course of the events of 1362 
[21 March 1983-20 March 1984] in the Voice and Vision, which 
resulted in the dismissal of the general manager by the 
Supervisory Council at the time and the reappointment of Mr. 
Hashemi by the late Imam to his position, Mr. Parvaresh and some 
like-minded persons said many things against the interference of 
the Imam and his family, which so upset the Imam that in his 
letter of 4 Tir 1362 [25 June 1983], he wrote: "It should be 
mentioned that it has been heard that some in my household do 
things contrary to my knowledge. Because this is not true, the 
person who has said such things must repent before God..." 
  Mr. Hashemi added: The presence of Mr. Parvaresh, with such 
a 
history, in the Inquiry and Investigation Group has compromised 
the "impartiality" of the group. At this point, the present 
members, expressing that they had no knowledge of Mr. 
Parvaresh's past history and the events in 1362 in the Voice and 
Vision, referring to their own past, promised to observe 
impartiality and not to allow anyone to influence their vote. 
  4) The Voice and Vision broadcasts annually about 82,000 
hours of radio and 12,500 hours of television programs 
throughout the country in more than 19 languages. During the 
period under consideration by the group, from 1360 [21 March 
1981-20 March 1982], when Mr. Hashemi took over the 
responsibility, it broadcast more than 1 million hours of 
programs. To examine 1 million hours of programming and express 
opinions about them, for that matter responsible opinions, would 
be very difficult, and considering the opponents and supporters 
of the Voice and Vision, the iNquiry and Investigation Group 
cannot base its judgment on what it hears. Rather, in every case 
that it intends to express its opinion, it must examine it 
directly and look at the documented evidence. 
  5) In regards to religious issues, the announcement was made 
that since the late Imam, in addition to being the owner of the 
revolution and the founder of the sacred regime of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, was a qualified religious jurist and a proven 
source of emulation, we have acted in accordance with the 
jurisprudential opinions of the Imam in the religious issues of 
the Voice and Vision, such as the way women appear on television 
or in music, and in such cases the committee cannot make a 
judgement based on its own views. Rather, it must announce its 
opinion on the basis of religious decrees and the opinions of 
the late Imam concerning the above-mentioned issues. In 
conclusion, he announced that in order to avoid any sort of 
doubt about lack of cooperation by the organization that can be 
misused by individuals with ill will or those who want to create 
doubt, all the information and documents needed by the committee 
should be requested in writing, and the Voice and Vision 
organization will send the information to you in writing. 
  6) From the date of 14/07/1371 [6 October 1992], Mr. 
Movahhedi-Savoji, the head of the Inquiry and Investigation 
Group, in several correspondences requested information from the 
Voice and Vision on 88 cases. All the requested information, 
which consisted of about 8,000 pages, was forwarded to the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group. 
  In the report that the Inquiry and Investigation Group 
broadcast on 11 and 12 Aban [2, 3 November] of this year from 
the Majles podium, except for one or two cases (which will be 
referred to later), not only is no mention made of the documents 
sent, but also the reporters of the group most unfairly have 
stated in several places in the report "despite lack of 
cooperation by the organization" or "given the lack of 
cooperation by the organization..." 
  7) When reading the report, Mr. Parvaresh announced that 
despite the lack of cooperation of the organization, the Inquiry 
and Investigation Group obtained its information through 
tangible and intangible ways. 
  8) In the course of the year that the inquiry and 
investigation activities were under way, a great deal of 
information about the members of the Inquiry and Investigation 
Group were given to the Voice and Vision organization, which, 
due to compliance with the directives of the late Imam and the 
grand leader and in consideration for our belief and faith, we 
have avoided revealing. But we will implicitly refer to one or 
two points that are very effective in the analysis of the report 
of the group, because lack of attention to these points may 
seriously compromise the facts. 
  A) In addition to Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh, who was active 
in 
the Hojjatiyeh Society, and we have referred to his ideological 
foundations, some of the other members of the organization also 
have had a history of cooperation with and activities in the 
Hojjatiyeh Society. 
  B) One of the members of the group married the wife of an 
executed Hypocrite as his second wife and presents her as the 
wife of a "martyr." But later it became clear that first she was 
the wife of an executed Hypocrite, and Second it was the same 
wife who had drawn her previous husband into the Hypocrite group. 
  Hence, the ideological foundations of some of the intangible 
elements of the Inquiry and Investigation Group become clear: 
the "Hojjatiyeh" and the "hypocrites." Also, the views of the 
"Hojjatiyeh" and the "hypocrites" concerning the late Imam and 
the grand leader and the supporters of the Imam are quite clear 
and requires no further explanation. 
  With attention to the above-mentioned points, we will now 
deal with the report of the Inquiry and Investigation Group that 
was read from the podium of the Majles on 11 and 12 Aban this 
year. 
  In concluding this preface, the management of the 
organization finds it necessary to thank all the 
self-sacrificers who in the course of the eight years of imposed 
war and bombing of cities, with their active and unassuming 
presence on the front lines of the battle, offering dozens of 
martyrs, and the broadcast of thousands of hours of war programs 
immortalized the resistance of our brave and courageous people 
and to which in the inquiry and investigation report not only is 
no reference made, but with hurtful sentences all that effort 
and self-sacrifice interpret it as lack of solidarity for the 
war. The management also expresses its appreciation to all the 
committed managers and employees of the organization who, 
despite the shortages and minimal resources, in the most 
critical conditions operated the Voice and Vision organization 
in the best possible manner and were praised frequently by Imam 
Khomeyni and the grand leader, Ayatollah Khamene'i, and who are 
presented in the inquiry and investigation report as frightened 
and alienated people, for certainly the munificent, just God 
will never let their efforts go unrewarded. 
  In the preface, the Inquiry and Investigation Group states: 
"The Voice and Vision programs can be produced in three ways, 
negative programs, neutral or indifferent programs, and programs 
in support of the revolution and Islam." 
  Voice and Vision's response: This kind of categorization is 
a 
creation of the Inquiry and Investigation Group. In the general 
categorization, in terms of goals, the Voice and Vision programs 
have the following objectives: 
  1) Guiding-instructional 
  2) Information-educational 
  3) Entertainment-recreational 
  Unfortunately, the nation that follows the Imam, on 13 Aban 
[4 November], the day of death to America and the day of the 
exile of the Imam, must hear from the mouth of one of the Majles 
deputies the theory of the "deviancy" of the "Crocodile Tears" 
serial. If this is not an actual example of cultural invasion 
for the enemy to speak against the opinions of the Imam through 
the mouths of the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group 
at the start of 13 Aban, then what is it? 
  In regards to the "Crocodile Tears" serial, the content of 
the "Crocodile Tears" serial was against the liberals and the 
agents of the United States and was approved by the late Imam. 
  The program has a guiding-instructional goal, that is, 
presenting the message with the intention of educating the 
society in the long term, and is based on a single point and the 
value foundation is in Islamic principles and beliefs. Programs 
with this goal, through instruction to do good and prevent doing 
evil, reminders and warnings, result in discussing the 
preservation and strengthening of the virtues and negating evil 
and prohibited acts both in internal and in social and general 
forms. In the programs with information-educational goals, 
information is presented in news and general forms. General 
information results in an increase in the general knowledge of 
the audience and is necessarily not tied to time. News 
information is the kind of information that is particularly 
important and is tied to time. 
  Educational programs in classic and nonclassic forms. 
Classical education is education that is somehow related to the 
official education of the country or assists it, such as lessons 
in philosophy, ethics, decrees, mathematics, physics, etc. 
  Nonclassical educational programs are those which result in 
the competence of various people in the society in connection 
with various issues, such as: Programs related to the Fire 
Department, driving and traffic, health, planting trees, 
repairing household appliances, security, work environment, 
children's health, etc. 
  Programs with entertainment-recreational goals: Presenting 
messages with the purpose of creating happiness, joy, peace of 
mind, and creating a possitive attitude in the audience, and 
also creating readiness to accept individual and social 
responsibilities and preventing the waste of people's leisure 
time. 
  Hence, the categorizations or definitions given by the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group have no basis in the Voice and 
Vision organization and have the goal of merely showing the 
programs in a negative light. 
  After this rather erratic preface, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group examines the films and serials and writes, 
in other words, from 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985] to 1371 
[21 March 1992-20 March 1993], about 900 films and serials have 
been broadcast from Networks 1 and 2, of which number about 700 
were foreign films and serials, which were produced highly 
technically and artistically and subsequently are very 
attractive and effective...and of these 700 cases, it only 
refers to one motion picture, "Billy Bud," and concludes that 
all these films were corrupt and spread Western culture. 
<H5>  Voice and Vision Response </H5>
  First, according to Paragraph 2 ratified by the Majles, the 
subject of inquiry and investigation was the activities of the 
general manager of the Voice and Vision, Mr. Hashemi, who was 
appointed on 15 Mordad 1360 [6 August 1981] as the general 
manager of the Voice and Vision. 
  It is not clear why the Voice and Vision in this examination 
started from 1363, whereas the general manager of the 
organization started his work from 15 Mordad 1360. 
  Second, according to the lists that were sent to the Inquiry 
and Investigation Group, from 1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982] 
to 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], in Vision Network 1 alone 
1,552 domestic shows were produced and the names of all the 
serials were sent to them. With the method of the Voice and 
Vision in rerunning programs, that is, broadcasting a serial 
once every three years, on the average, each of these segments 
has been shown twice in 10 years. Moreover, serials and shows 
that are produced in the provincial centers must be added to 
these numbers. During the period under examination, about 3,500 
cases alone were domestic serials and shows broadcast from the 
two television networks. It is unclear to the officials of the 
Voice and Vision why the Inquiry and Investigation Group, 
despite having the names of all the programs and the production 
statistics, has reduced this number to one-seventeenth of what 
it should be. Clearly, what they meant to do was to show the 
number and percentage of foreign programs as large and accuse 
the television of propagating Western culture. 
  In this area, the second very important point is that in the 
years after the victory of the Islamic revolution, the sources 
for the procurement of foreign programs of the Voice and Vision 
have been mostly Eastern and Islamic countries, such as Japan, 
China, India, Egypt, Algeria, Syria, and Indonesia, and Western 
sources have been used less often. Japanese programs have had 
the largest share in foreign programs. 
  Among the foreign serials, those such as "Ezzoddin Qasam," 
"Tariq ol-Qods," "Seyyed Jamaleddin Asadabadi," or films such as 
"Mohammad (Prophet of God)," "Fire Under the Ashes," etc., 
  [Paragraphing as published] exist, the subject matter of 
which is 100-percent Islamic and epic, or serials such as "Away 
From Home (Ushin)" and "The Teacher of the Island," which were 
not only not educationally misleading but also, with dubbing and 
modifications, have been very instructional. 
  Now, why the Investigation Group in mentioning foreign 
programs only chooses to analyze one or two examples or why it 
considers all the programs "Western" is unclear to us. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group, after quoting several 
errors and lies, concludes that "therefore, in the 14 years that 
have passed since the Voice and Vision was established, our 
young people have benefitted from foreign culture 75 percent and 
our own culture 25 percent!" 
  In other words, an average of 14.12 percent is the share of 
the foreign programs in Networks 1 and 2. With the above 
description, although many of these programs have been produced 
in other countries, they have values acceptable and respected by 
our society. 
  It must be noted that this situation of 14.12 percent 
concerns Networks 1 and 2, which broadcast about 6,000 hours 
annually. Also taking into consideration about 6,500 hours of 
television programs in the provincial centers, the foreign share 
of which is nearly zero, the share of foreign programs in the 
programs of the Vision is reduced to about 7 percent. And if we 
add to them the radio programs of Tehran and the provincial 
centers that have no foreign programs, the broadcast of about 
54,000 hours of programs annually, the share of foreign programs 
in the Voice and Vision programs is about 1.3 percent. 
  Let us review the sentence by the Inquiry and Investigation 
Group on this matter: 
  "In other words, after 14 years since the Voice and Vision 
was established, our young people have benefitted 75 percent 
from foreign culture and 25 percent from our own culture." 
  However, as was stated, in the total of programs of the 
Voice 
and Vision broadcast domestically, the share of foreign programs 
is only 1.3 percent, and the share of our own programs is 98.7 
percent. 
  If the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group were 
not the deputies of the people in the Majles who have promised 
on the Koran to sign this oath: 
  "I take an oath on the Koran before Almighty God to guard 
the 
sanctity of Islam and preserve the fruits of the Islamic 
revolution of the Iranian people and the foundations of the 
Islamic Republic; to guard what the nation has entrusted us with 
as a just trustee; to observe trustworthiness and piety in 
carrying out my duties as a deputy;, and always to be steadfast 
in the independence and victory of the country and preservation 
of the rights of the people; to serve the people; to defend the 
Constitution; and in my speeches, writings, and opinions, to 
keep the independence of the country and the freedom of the 
people and their interests in mind." 
  We would not say to them: 
  Gentlemen, you who are sitting in a position of judgment and 
have spent a year, how and with what conscience and piety did 
you allow yourselves to increase 1.3 percent to 75 percent and 
reduce 98.7 percent to 25 percent? 
  Is this an example of your piety and your commitment before 
the Koran and Almighty God? 
  In the continuation of the same discussion, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group states: "And this is provided the 25-percent 
programs of our own are not cut by the quality control blade. 
For example, the serial `The Active Neighborhood' ridicules the 
revolution and the regime or the serial, `Crocodile Tears,' 
which was made at unbelievable cost but many parts of which were 
omitted due to deviant problems and the segments which were 
broadcast were the target of widespread protest by the people 
due to deviant problems...!" 
  Voice and Vision response: In the preface, we said 
that among the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group 
are those who were active in the Hojjatiyyeh Society and have 
Hojjatiyeh ideologies and also those who have married 
hypocrites, the wife of an executed Hypocrite. Also, Mr. 
Parvaresh in the events of 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] of 
the Voice and Vision was among the opponents of the general 
manager, Mr. Hashemi, and was one of those who had accused the 
Imam's family unjustly concerning the reappointment of Mr. 
Hashemi by the late Imam. One of the issues that in those days 
was the source of conflict was the serial, "Crocodile Tears." 
The content of "Crocodile Tears" was against the liberals and in 
a most appropriate manner exposed the liberals and those 
affiliated with the West, especially the criminal United States. 
  Some elements of a mind like that of Mr. Parvaresh, who in 
those days had sensitive positions in the Voice and Vision, 
opposed the serial "Crocodile Tears" vehemently and wanted to 
prevent its broadcast in any way possible. 
  When the fourth segment of the serial was being broadcast, 
they had a petition signed to request that the serial be stopped: 
  Mr. Mohammad Hashemi (the general manager of the 
organization 
at the time) visited the Imam and asked his honor for 
instructions in regards to the issue of the petition and the 
stopping of the serial. The Imam said: "In my opinion, the 
liberals have deceived those who have signed the petition. The 
broadcast of the serial should continue." 
  The Imam's opinion was reported in the organization and it 
was decided that the serial be continued. But a group of a like 
mind to Mr. Parvaresh, who were influential in those days in 
broadcasting in Network 1, could not tolerate more than six 
segments, and after the broadcast of the 9th segment, the 10th, 
11th, 12th, and 13th segments of the serial, which in fact 
contained the harshest attacks on the liberals and the 
supporters of the United States, were summed up in one segment 
under the pretext of antireligious scenes and the announcement 
was made that the serial was ended. 
  The Imam, God rest his soul, summoned the general manager at 
the time (Mr. Mohammad Hashemi) and announced that the 
production and broadcast of the other segments of this serial 
were to continue and in response to those who have raised 
questions in regards to the religious aspects of the serial 
said: "Experts were consulted, they said that there may have 
been religious violations in the production of this serial, but 
its broadcast was not in violation of religious law." This 
announcement was broadcast at that time, after the broadcast of 
the last segment of the serial from Network 1 and the Vision. 
  Unfortunately, now the Inquiry and Investigation Group has 
placed its finger on a few instances out of 1,552 domestic 
production programs, one of which is "Crocodile Tears." 
  Mr. Parvaresh and those like-minded people know well that 
the 
Imam approved this serial despite the opposition at the time, 
asked that it be continued, and neutralized the conspiracy that 
was instigated by him and those like-minded people in declaring 
the serial in violation of religious law! 
  Unfortunately, the people who follow the Imam, at the start 
of 13 Aban [4 November], the day of death of American and the 
day of the Imam's exile, must hear from one of the deputies of 
the Majles the opinion that the "Crocodile Tears" serial is 
"deviant." If this is not an actual example of the cultural 
invasion of the enemy expressed from the mouth of the members of 
Inquiry and Investigation Group on 13 Aban against the opinions 
of the Imam, then what is it? 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group writes in the 
continuation of this discussion: "Serials are produced at high 
cost but with such internal problems that after production they 
are declared unsuitable for broadcast, for example, the serial 
"Ziba Beauty Salon" or some of the films that are protested to 
and declared unsuitable for broadcast, such as "Haji Washington" 
and "The Death of Yazdgerd." 
  Voice and Vision response: First, the broadcast 
time of the serial "Ziba Beauty Salon," when it was produced, 
was projected to be Fall 1372 [1993]; several segments have been 
broadcast so far and no changes have been made to it. Hence, the 
tangible and intangible sources of the Inquiry and Investigation 
Group here, too, have acted cleverly and mischievously and 
forced them to present an untruthful report. Second, as it was 
said, the period of inquiry and investigation is the time of 
management of Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, that is, from Mordad 1360 
[23 July-22 August 1981]. 
  However, the production of the films "Haji Washington" and 
"The Death of Yazdgerd" began in late 1357 [21 March 1978-20 
March 1979] in Italy and reached Iran about 1358 [21 March 
1979-20 March 1980] and they were never broadcast on television. 
And if they had been broadcast, it would have no relation to the 
period of management of Mr. Mohammad Hashemi. And if the claim 
of the Inquiry and Investigation Group is true, that it was 
broadcast once and then considered unsuitable for broadcast, it 
must be counted as a positive measure in the management of Mr. 
Hashemi. 
  But the question that is raised here is, when the Inquiry 
and 
Investigation Group reports on the domestic productions of the 
Voice and Vision, why does it start from 1363 [21 March 1984-20 
March 1985]? In other words, it ignores three years of the 
activities of the management to show the statistics as low, but 
when it wants to express a negative point, it returns to the 
activities of three years earlier, that is, 1357 [21 March 
1978-20 March 1979] and 1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980]. Is 
this another indication of piety and fairness? God is the best 
judge. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group in continuation writes: 
"Of course, of the 25-percent domestic production, only 8 
percent is made by the Voice and Vision and the rest is 
purchased from outside the organization." 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group shows extreme 
sensitivity 
toward the program, "The Sinister Conspiracy," and even unjustly 
accuses one of the main elements. "The Sinister Conspiracy" was 
a show concerning the appearance of Zionism and is against 
Israel. This show, due to its valuable content, has been 
broadcast three times so far. 
  Voice and Vision response: As was stated, first, 
domestic production is not 25 percent but 98.7 percent. 
  Second, of this amount, less than half a percent is 
purchased 
from outside the organization and the rest, that is, 98.3 
percent, is produced within the organization. Besides, of the 
amount that is purchased from outside, except for motion 
pictures, the rest is produced under the supervision of the 
Voice and Vision and then purchased. 
  In this case, in truth, we could not understand what 
objective the Inquiry and Investigation Committee is pursuing in 
this false report in order to respond to it. 
  Continuing this discussion, the Inquiry and Investigation 
Group deals with the "Hezardastan" serial and criticizes this 
serial for not dealing with such clerical heroes as Modarres and 
Sheykh Fazlollah Nuri and in continuation writes: In this 
serial, the assassin of martyr Sheykh Fazlollah Nuri, in a 
cinematic trick, is presented as a brave, free, emotional, 
oppressed, justice-seeking, antiforeign, mystical, patriotic 
person. 
  Voice and Vision response: First, the 
"Hezardastan" serial began in 1354 [21 March 1975-20 March 1976] 
with the name "The Silk Road," and until 1360 [21 March 1981-20 
March 1982], when Mr. Hashemi assumed this responsibilities, it 
continued under the same name. More than 18 hours were filmed 
and a great deal was spent on it (the subject of the serial was 
a presentation of Reza Khan, the bully, as the Iranian silk 
road). In 1360, the serial was ordered stopped. The Supervisory 
Council at the time pursued the issue of the serial and 
appointed a committee to review the parts that had already been 
produced, study the script, and take the necessary steps to 
revise the serial in a way that would make it suitable for 
broadcast. 
  The group selected by the Supervisory Council began its work 
under the supervision of the council and after months succeeded 
in changing the subject of the serial totally and preparing it 
for broadcast in the best possible form and content. Of course, 
given the characteristics, the serial was not without minor 
problems, but on the whole, with the efforts of the committee 
selected by the Supervisory Council of the time, it became 
suitable for broadcast. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group continues: "In the 
program `The Seventh Art,' where there is a discussion of the 
former Soviet cinema (the host of the program is a well-known 
Westernized person who has inflicted blows on Islam for years in 
the university environment and has been in conflict with 
religious forces), the reason for the disintegration of the 
Soviet government is mentioned as the setting of rules for 
artists and restriction of their freedom, thereby indicating 
that the artist must be free to create what he wants, and in 
this way tries to misguide the artists to deviate from serving 
Islam and the revolution." 
  Voice and Vision response: Apparently the purpose 
of the Inquiry and Investigation Group from this segment is to 
unjustly accuse a Voice and Vision host, a retired person from 
the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance--as he has 
claimed--who teaches in universities. 
  Of the accusations they have made against him, nothing has 
been recorded. His activities in the Voice and Vision have been 
positive and if in an artistic program he has mentioned one of 
the faults of the dictatorial communist government, that is, 
depriving artists of their freedom, how can this be criticized? 
  Does the Inquiry and Investigation Group believe that in the 
Islamic society artists are not free and are forced to make 
programs under the pressure of the government? Is this not the 
same opinion and analysis that frequently the Hypocrite 
minigroup and other counterrevolutionary minigroups made of the 
government of the Islamic Republic of Iran? 
  Have such claims of the counterrevolutionary groups been 
able 
to affect the committed artists and prevent them from serving 
the Islamic society? 
  Today, one of our best propaganda tools is to make use of 
committed artists. The same artists have created thousands of 
art works, including beautiful, epic poems to dignified shows 
after the revolution. 
  It is not clear to the officials of the Voice and Vision why 
the Inquiry and Investigation Group, despite having the names of 
all the programs and production and broadcast statistics, has 
reduced this number by one-seventeenth. Certainly they intended 
to make the number and percentage of foreign programs large and 
accuse the television of propagating Western culture. 
  Gentlemen, you who are sitting in positions of judgment and 
have spent one year, how and with what conscience and piety did 
you allow yourselves to increase 1.3 percent foreign programs to 
75 percent and decrease 98.7 percent domestic programs to 25 
percent? 
  The program "The Seventh Art" is an instructive program 
full of content and attractive for experts. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group has not expressed any 
opinion concerning the content of this program. Under the 
pretext of this very sensitive program they have tried to show 
that "artists in the Islamic society do not have freedom," 
precisely the same accusations that the Hypocrite minigroup and 
other counterrevolutionary minigroups have made against the 
regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
<H5>  Examination of the Programs of Vision Network 1 </H5>
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group refers to the programs 
of 
two weeks of the Vision Network 1 during the seven years, one 
the week of 25/12/1363 to 02/01/1364 [16-22 March 1985], that 
is, the New Year programs, and another the programs of the week 
of 26/01/1370 to 01/02/1370 [15-21 April 1991], that is, the 
week coinciding with the four days of holidays (Fetr celebration 
holidays), and concludes that 45 percent of the programs of 
Network 1 were in connection with Islam and the revolution and 
55 percent of the programs were indifferent to Islam and the 
revolution. It also adds that in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 
1985], foreign films and serials made up 24 percent of all the 
programs and in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] this ratio 
increased to 38 percent of all the programs and writes: 
"Apparently, the Voice and Vision is gradually losing its 
Islamic and revolutionary motivation and is becoming indifferent 
and neutral." The Inquiry and Investigation group then examines 
the programs of the Vision Network 2. In examining the programs 
of the two weeks out of seven years, it points out: 
  One is the program of the week of 25/12/1363 to 02/01/1364, 
that is the 1364 [21 March 1985-20 March 1986] New Year, and 
another the programs of 07/09/1371 to 14/09/1371 [28 November-5 
December 1992]. And it concludes that in this network, too, 36 
percent of the programs have the Islamic messages of the 
revolution and 64 percent of the messages are neutral and 
unrelated to the revolution and Islam. In the conclusion of this 
section, it adds: If we consider the total programs of Networks 
1 and 2, of the 85 weekly programs of the two networks in 1363, 
39.5 hours concerned Islam and the revolution and in 1370 [21 
March 1991-20 March 1992], out of 92 hours of weekly programs of 
the two networks, 33.5 hours concerned the revolution and Islam 
and 58 hours were neutral and indifferent. 
  Voice and Vision response: First, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group has examined the programs of one week of one 
network during the New Year holidays and generalized them to all 
the programs of the Voice and Vision organization over a 
seven-year period. 
  Second, in a few lines on the previous page, they had 
claimed 
that only 25 percent of the Voice and Vision programs are our 
own and 75 percent of all programs are Western and anti-Islamic 
culture. If we compare these figures of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group, we realize the contradictions of the group, 
because if 39.5 hours out of 85 hours, that is about 45 percent 
of the programs even during the New Year holidays, concern Islam 
and the revolution, naturally, they were domestic programs. 
  Third, which fair, impartial, and just group would find it 
logical to examine only the programs of one week and one part of 
an organization and generalize its findings to cover seven 
years, whereas they were supposed to examine the activities of 
12 years, and apparently they have expressed their opinion 
concerning 12 years. If we convert this ratio to mathematical 
figures, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has examined 85 
hours out of more than a million hours of programs, and 
incidentally, for a specific week, and then makes a judgment 
about a million hours of programming. 
  Is this the meaning of impartiality and precision by the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group? And is this the meaning of the 
piety that is cited in the oath of the Majles? 
  Fourth, in categorizing the programs, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group mentions the programs to be unrelated to 
Islam and the revolution or neutral, indifferent and deviant. 
  If we were to make the same categorization about other 
organizations, what percentage of their activities would conform 
to Islam and the revolution? For example, what percentage of the 
ratifications of the Majles are directly related to the 
revolution? Or what percentage of the school textbooks are 
directly related to the revolution and Islam? Why should the 
group engage in such categorization that it would itself find 
contradictory and not be able to use in any other case? 
  Fifth, as was mentioned, the goals of the programs of the 
Voice and Vision are guidance related, educational, 
informational, instructional, recreational, and for 
entertainment. This program has not broadcast one moment of 
neutral programs and will not do so. All the programs have a 
goal and are instructive, and this is not a claim by the Voice 
and Vision, but the opinion that the Imam expressed in Fall 1366 
[1987]. 
  In those days, some individuals in newspapers and some from 
podiums began to create a climate against the programs of the 
Voice and Vision and considered the programs indifferent, 
neutral, and educationally misleading, in violation of religious 
law. 
  One of the deputies of the Majles from the Supervisory 
Council asked the opinion of the late Imam in writing concerning 
the programs of the Voice and Vision. Here, we call to the 
attention of the honorable audience the question and answer: 
  Honorable Grand Ayatollah, Imam Khomeyni, 
  The Grand Leader of the Revolution and Founder of the 
Islamic 
Republic of Iran, may his blessings perpetuate. 
  Respectfully, in connection with the broadcast of some 
foreign films or domestic productions and serials, such as "Fall 
in the Meadows," "Mirror," and "Influence," as well as the 
broadcast of music from the Voice and Vision, some complaints 
are sent from the martyr-nurturing nation, especially the 
honorable families of the martyrs, self-sacrificers, 
missing-in-action, and prisoners of war, to the Supervisory 
Council stating that the broadcast of such films, serials, and 
music is contrary to the sacred laws of Islam, contrary to the 
lofty goals of the revolution, inappropriate for the regime of 
the Islamic Republic, and cause the spread of unveiling and 
improper veiling and are misleading, not to mention that to 
spend the budget on their production is considered waste, 
although they may also be instructional, recreational, and 
entertaining. 
  In comparing such instances with the existing decrees in the 
scholarly dissertations and writings of Your Excellency and 
determining what is allowed and not allowed, there are 
differences of opinion and explicit and correct answers cannot 
be given to those who raise the questions. Differences in taste 
also exist and one does not know what must be done. What must be 
done under these sensitive war conditions, which is the most 
important of affairs? 
  Another point is that when the complaints, which are 
generally from the nation in whom the revered Imam is interested 
and those who have given martyrs and the Hezbollah, are given to 
the managers and executive officials they say: "The Imam sees 
all these programs and listens to the music; if there are 
problems, he will mention them." 
  Since "investigating the complaints and responding to them 
and taking rapid steps to eliminate the deficiencies" is one of 
the legal duties of the Supervisory Council, please write your 
blessed opinion concerning the above-mentioned issues in order 
for us to be able to carry out our grave religious and legal 
duties properly and not be responsible before that revered imam 
and the divine nation of Iran. 
  Greetings to you and may the blessings of God be yours 
  Esma'il Ferdowsipur 
  Member of the Voice and Vision Supervisory Council 
&lt;graphic&gt; 

  &lt;titl&gt; The opinion of the Imam and the 
letter is as follows:&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In the name of the Almighty: 
  Viewing such films and plays is not inappropriate from a 
religious standpoint and many of them are instructive and their 
broadcast also is proper. Also, films on sports and music are 
also mostly appropriate. Sometimes, rarely, the opposite 
happens, and more care must be taken. However, two points must 
be observed. First, those who apply makeup must be an intimate 
[one with whom marriage is prohibited]. A stranger is 
prohibited [religiously] from doing this. Second, the viewers 
must not perceive these works as lustful. Ruhollah Khomeyni. 
  Once again, note the question and answer: 
  The person posing the question writes: "The broadcast of 
such 
films, serials, and music is contrary to the sacred laws of 
Islam, contrary to the lofty goals of the revolution, 
inappropriate for the regime of the Islamic Republic, and causes 
the spread of unveiling and improper veiling and are misleading, 
not to mention that to spend the budget on their production is 
considered waste, although they may also be instructional, 
recreational, and entertaining." 
  The Imam responds: "Watching such films and plays is not a 
problem from a religious standpoint and many of them are 
instructional and their broadcast also is no problem. Also, 
sports films or music are also mostly no problem. Sometimes, 
violations are seen, rarely, and more care must be taken." 
  Gentlemen of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, this 
opinion of the Imam is from 29 Azar 1366 [20 December 1987], 
that is about seven years of the period during which you 
examined the Voice and Vision programs. 
  Honorable gentlemen, in the first meeting of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group, the director of the Voice and Vision 
organization announced the opinion of the Imam to you and you 
expressed your lack of knowledge. Then he sent you a copy of the 
questions and answers with the text of the Imam's statements and 
the text of his reverence's decree in letter No. 
M/2300/569/5160, dated 21/07/1371 [13 October 1992]. 
  Gentlemen of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, in the 
joint meeting with the director of the Voice and Vision 
organization, you announced that you are all emulators and 
followers of the Imam. What is the meaning of such conflict 
between your views and those of the Imam? 
  The Imam said many of the programs are instructive. You say 
they mostly have neutral, indifferent, or deviant messages. 
  The Imam said there is for the most part no problem. You say 
it is mostly problematic. The Imam said violations are rarely 
seen. You say, except for a small percentage, the rest are in 
violation. Still you claim to be emulators, obedient, and 
followers of the Imam? 
  Honorable gentlemen, the day that Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, the 
director of the Voice and Vision, reminded you that with the 
presence of Mr. Parvaresh, with his history and his opposition 
to the views of the Imam concerning the Voice and Vision, the 
group has lost its "impartiality," you claimed that the members 
of the group are all obedient emulators and followers of the 
Imam and do not allow anyone to influence their opinion and 
votes. Was this your impartiality and being followers of the 
Imam? In continuing its examination, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group writes about the Vision Network 2: "Network 
2 has translated four plays into Persian at high cost and 
produced them as television serials, for which 100-percent 
similar foreign ones existed, such that one might well imagine 
they were imported from abroad. And this is while 79 percent of 
films and serials are foreign and Network 2, instead of 
producing films and serials in defense of Islam and the 
revolution, still has added to foreign problems. 
  Voice and Vision response: Certainly the dear 
audience does not know which plays and films the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group is referring to. In order to clarify the 
matter, we will mention the name of one film and one play. One 
of these films is "Conspiracy," which in a beautiful way shows 
the criminality of the Americans, even in hospitals and in 
regards to patients. 
  This film was broadcast about a year ago from Baku 
Television, "Azerbaijan," and was strongly protested by the 
Americans. The government of Baku at the time was strongly 
questioned by the U.S. Ambassador for broadcasting the film. One 
of the plays that was referred to is "The Inspector Enters." 
  This play very beautifully questions and exposes the 
judicial 
system and Government of England. Indeed, it is not clear to us 
why the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, out of 
1,552 domestically produced shows whose names were given to 
them, place their fingers on a few specific cases which have 
upset the Americans and British as well as, as will be described 
later, the Israelis. 
  Indeed, why? 
  In order for you to see these programs that are contrary to 
the revolution and are deviant, soon we will broadcast the film, 
"Conspiracy" for you from television. You can judge whether the 
film is against the United States and contrary to the 
revolution. We believe exposing the criminal United States is 
the duty of every revolutionary Muslim today. 
  In the conclusion of this section, we provide the combined 
chart of the goals of the Vision programs and also the combined 
chart of the domestic and foreign programs of the two networks. 
  As you can see: 
  In terms of the goals, the programs are produced and 
broadcast with the three goals of guidance-education, 
information-instruction, and entertainment-recreation. Hence, no 
program has a neutral, indifferent, or deviant message. In the 
charts of the composition of the domestic and foreign programs 
of the two networks, as can be seen, 14.12 percent is the share 
of foreign programs of the two networks and 85.82 percent the 
share of domestic programs. These statistics include all the 
programs of the two networks, including children's programming, 
shows, films, and serials. 
  Hence, it can be seen to what extent the claim of the 
Inquiry 
and Investigation Group and the statistics that they have 
presented are untrue and contrary to the facts. 
  We emphasize, these percentages merely concern the programs 
of the two television networks. If the programs of the Voice and 
Vision of the provincial centers and Tehran radio are included, 
the ratio of foreign programs to domestic ones is about 1.3 
percent. In other words, 98.7 percent of the programs of the 
Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic are domestically 
produced by ourselves, and 1.3 percent of all the Voice and 
Vision programs are imported from abroad, whereas the Inquiry 
and Investigation Group, as was mentioned, states this ratio as 
75-percent foreign and 25-percent domestic. 
  God willing, God will grant us the ability and fairness to 
see the facts and judge accordingly. 
  As it was said, the Voice and Vision organization during the 
period under examination by the Inquiry and Investigation Group 
produced 1,552 shows domestically, almost every segment of the 
program was broadcast twice, and the names of all the programs 
were sent to the Inquiry and Investigation Group. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown sensitivity to 
the following programs: 
  1) Concerning the serial "Crocodile Tears," the content of 
the serial "Crocodile Tears" was against the liberals and the 
supporters of the United States and approved by the late Imam. 
  2) In regards to the motion picture "Conspiracy," produced 
by 
Vision Network 2, the content of the motion picture "Conspiracy" 
is against U.S. crimes, even in hospitals and in regards to 
patients. When this film was broadcast from Baku Television, the 
U.S Ambassador in Azerbaijan strongly protested the broadcast of 
this film. 
  3) The Inquiry and Investigation Group showed sensitivity to 
the show"The Interrogator [as published; previously `Inspector'] 
Enters." This progra questions the British judicial system 
beautifully and shows the criminality of the British. 
  4) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has shown extreme 
sensitivity to the program "Sinister Conspiracy" and even 
unjustly accuses one of the main people involved. 
  The series "Sinister Conspiracy" concerns the appearance of 
Zionism and is against Israel. Because of its valuable content, 
this series has been shown three times so far. 
  5) The Inquiry and Investigation Group shows sensitivity 
towards the serial "Primrose." The producers of the serial 
"Primrose" had the honor to meet with the grand leader, who 
expressed his praise for them. Also, the honorable head of the 
Judicial Branch, Ayatollah Yazdi, in a letter to the Voice and 
Vision organization, expressed his praise for this group. The 
honorable speaker of the Majles at the time also met with this 
group and praised them. 
  6) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has shown 
sensitivity to the programs that the organization has produced 
and broadcast in connection with the war. 
  The reporters and narrators of war programs were frequently 
commended by the high ranking officials of the sacred regime of 
the Islamic Republic, and last year these dear ones received a 
Koran and other prizes from the grand leader for their beautiful 
programs. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown sensitivity to 
the show "The Interrogator Enters." This series very beautifully 
questions the British judicial system and shows the criminality 
of the British. 
  7) The Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown sensitivity 
to the serial "The Lesson in the Mirror." Those mainly involved 
in this serial were commended by the grand leader and other high 
ranking officials of the country. For the officials of the Voice 
and Vision this question exists: Why out of 1,552 show segments 
has the Inquiry and Investigation Group shown sensitivity to 
programs that were approved by the Imam, the grand leader, and 
other high-ranking officials of the regime, and for which they 
have been commended, or those that have been against the United 
States, Israel, England, and the liberals. They have shown 
sensitivity as best they could. Of course, it can be accepted 
that the Inquiry and Investigation Group has not been aware of 
some of those instances, but in some instances, certainly the 
group, or some of its members, were aware. 
  Here we find it necessary to make one point, which is that 
the officials of the Voice and Vision have never claimed that no 
criticism of the programs of the Voice and Vision is warranted, 
but have always asked experts to announce to us their opinions 
in order to improve the quality and content of the programs. It 
has been due to such care and solidarity that the programs of 
this organization have always been growing and continue to grow, 
and for this reason the organization has been able to gain the 
trust of the Islamic nation such that people devote 88 percent 
of their leisure time to its programs. 
  We ask God Almighty not to abandon us, even for a moment. 
  Amen, Oh Lord of Two Worlds.

<H3>  Response of the Basij of the Voice and Vision to the Report 
of the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group </H3>
  Following the report of the honorable Inquiry and 
Investigation Committee of the Majles, the Basij of the Voice 
and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
considers it its duty to inform the martyr-nurturing people of 
Iran of the following. 
  The Voice and Vision organization has always protected and 
supported the Basij institution located in that organization. 
Any organization that itself, as a storming army on the front 
line of the battle of right against wrong, has always propagated 
Islamic values and reported the bravery and courage of the 
self-sacrificing combatants in the best possible manner could 
not have been successful in this grand mission without the 
sufficient support of the organization. 
  In the course of the imposed war, the Basij of the 
organization have been able to have the following activities by 
making use of the sufficient resources of the Voice and Vision. 
  1) Attracting and organizing forces to train and dispatch to 
the front in individual and collective from in most general and 
personnel dispatches. 
  2) Ideological instructions, culture, the Koran, emergency 
and other instructions for the Basij forces. 
  3) Holding of great ceremonies on the occasions of the 
blessed 10 days of Fajr, Basij Week, Sacred Defense Week, Unity 
Week, the passing away of the Imam, holidays, mournings, etc. 
  4) Dispatch of propaganda and cultural teams and showing of 
films in the course of the eight years of sacred defense to the 
fronts in the west and the south. 
  5) Dispatch of 50-member teams of employees of the 
organization to visit the front frequently. 
  6) Sending cash and material help and collections from 
employees and the organization in people's aid convoys to the 
front, for example, six tractors. 
  7) Holding of 12 military training courses for 5 percent of 
the employees of the organization in accordance with the 
circular letter of the government in the Balal Mosque and the 
barracks for 1,700 people. 
  8) Implementation of ideological, cultural, and political 
competitions for all the employees of the organization. 
  9) Establishment of a Basij unit for the sisters throughout 
the organization. 
  10) Holding exhibitions of pictures, posters, films, and 
books on various occasions. 
  11) Close relationship and constant active presence in all 
the programs and ceremonies announced by the Center for the 
Basij of offices and factories of the Guard Corps and 
coordination with that institution are among the activities of 
this headquarters. 
  Active presence in the Basij ceremonies and moral and 
psychological support of the honorable deputy director of the 
organization is not unknown to any of the Basij members of the 
organization, and this issue is encouraging for the members of 
the Basij. 
  The sufficient support of the organization for the Basij has 
always continued without any problem through the honorable 
administrative and financial deputy director and the honorable 
director general for the expenditures of the activities. 
  The honorable deputy director for provincial affairs and 
Majles affairs of the organization has always strived to create 
close relations between the Basij stationed in Tehran and the 
Basij bases in provincial centers and to create resources to 
establish new bases in provincial cities. 
  At the present, about 18 Basij bases are active in the Voice 
and Vision of provincial cities and seven bases of resistance in 
Tehran. 
  Membership in the logistics headquarters of the war in the 
organization was achieved on the recommendation and emphasis of 
the director of the organization personally, and the 
responsibility for secretary of this headquarters was conferred 
on a member of the Basij Council of the organization by him. 
  At the present time, a number of managers are members of the 
Basij of the organization. On the whole, all the managers of the 
organization, including the most senior to the middle-management 
level, have always helped the Basij in advancing its actions 
toward the sacred goals of the regime and participated and still 
participate in the seminars held by the Basij. 
  The latest example is a seminar that will be held in Aban 
[23 
October-21 November] in the holy city of Mashhad in which 
managers from various levels will participate. 
  Also, the members of the Basij are all employees of the 
organization and in addition to usual salary and benefits for 
this work enjoy all the legal benefits for combatants and 
self-sacrificers. 
  [9 Nov p 14, Part II] 
  [Text] Following the presentation of the honorable Inquiry 
and Investigation Committee in the financial divisions of the 
Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
which was read in the open session of the honorable Majles, it 
is necessary to announce certain issues in order to inform the 
public concerning the issues raised. 
  Unfortunately, due to lack of sufficient experience and work 
in evaluation and determining the efficiency of the systems, 
methods, and activities of the government institutions and lack 
of a tradition and history of scientific inquiry and 
investigation in Iran, the result is the presentation of the 
existing report and the judgment of those who prepared the 
report. The report indicates that not only have the persons who 
were chosen to conduct inquiry and investigation of the 
organization not had sufficient experience in auditing and 
evaluation of financial issues, but they also have not even been 
aware that the expression of opinion concerning the activities 
and evaluation of an organization such as the Voice and Vision 
organization with all its complexities require efficient, 
effective, and economic cost auditing. If the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group had the slightest familiarity with auditing 
procedures, they would know that the result of evaluation is 
effective and successful when all three aspects mentioned above 
are simultaneously examined, evaluated, and judged. They would 
then not engage in presenting only a select few items in the 
accounts in a most "public deceiving" manner and would not 
misguide the path to auditing, evaluation, and control that is 
going through the initial steps. 
  What is important in regard to the report of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group is that despite the fact that the committee 
had access to the detailed information of the organization, they 
never asked for an explanation from the related officials of the 
organization concerning their interpretations and criticism. 
Perhaps the explanations of the officials of the organization 
could eliminate some of the ambiguities and questions of the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group. 
  Considering the preface, the main points in the report are 
referred to. 
<H5>  1. Lack of Cooperation by the Auditor </H5>
  At the start of the report by the committee, reference is 
made to lack of cooperation by the auditor with the committee. 
This claim and the statements were based on predetermined 
specific goals. The text of the presented report, which involves 
the most minor financial issues and instances and accounting 
documents and gives opinions about them, indicates the fact that 
the committee was given full cooperation in presenting the 
information requested, and never has any direct contact with the 
auditor received a negative response. 
<H3>  2. Verification of the Balance Sheet of the Organization of 
the Supervisory Council </H3>
  The duty of the financial affairs unit is to prepare and 
regulate the balance sheet and the list of annual revenues and 
expenditures. In recent years, based on the existing documents 
and records, the financial records every year, prior to the 
appointed time in a form and content better than the previous 
year, and as usual approved by the honorable director of the 
organization, have been sent for the approval of the Supervisory 
Council of the organization. If the balance sheet is not 
approved by the Supervisory Council, it would have nothing to do 
with the duties of the financial and executive affairs of the 
organization. 
  Should the organization activities, the financial 
operations, 
and recording and transfer of account balances from one year to 
another stop because the balance sheet of the organization was 
not approved by the Supervisory Council? 
<H5>  3. The Structure of the Organization </H5>
  The structure of the organization, including the financial 
affairs organization, was approved by the Supervisory Council of 
the organization at the time and the creation of the "financial 
activities evaluation unit" in the financial affairs complex of 
the organization was done with the approval of the Supervisory 
Council. Later, in order to carry out the above-mentioned 
duties, the internal auditing unit was projected and approved 
within the authority of the director of the organization. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has not carefully 
studied and examined the laws and regulations governing the 
Voice and Vision organization and its ratified organizations. 
Hence, it has presented incorrect and untrue information in its 
report. 
<H5>  4. Income Tax of the Organization </H5>
  According to Article 1 of the law of administration of the 
Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran ratified in 
1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981], the Voice and Vision 
organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran is an independent 
"organization" and... As you can see, contrary to what the 
Inquiry and Investigation Committee has understood and 
interpreted, the goal of the legislature was not to create a 
government company. 
  In Article 138 of the general national accounting law, the 
Voice and Vision organization has merely regarded a "government 
company" in terms of the implementation of this law. Hence, in 
terms of the implementation of direct tax laws and other laws, 
the organization cannot be considered a "government company." 
Ultimately, as is clear by the name of the "Voice and Vision 
organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran," this is a 
government organization that is subject to any law, provided it 
is mentioned by name. 
  According to Paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the direct tax laws 
ratified by the Majles, government ministries and establishments 
and organizations whose budget is provided by the government as 
well as city halls and establishments affiliated with the 
government and city halls which have been established in a form 
other than a company in accordance with the laws are exempt from 
taxes. The Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
receives more than 95 percent of its financial resources from 
the general budget of the government and in the form of aid and, 
based on its legal form, which was referred to above, is not 
subject to payment of taxes. 
<H3>  5. Inspection and Auditing of the Activities of the 
Organization </H3>
  The report of the Inquiry and Investigation Committee states 
that after the revolution, the activities of the organization 
have not been injected and examined by any authority. The 
honorable committee has not even paid the slightest attention to 
the matters presented in its own report either, because at the 
beginning of the committee report reference is made to the 
efforts of the Accounting Office concerning auditing and 
examination of the accounts of the organization. Also, the 
National Inspection Organization has established a special 
office in the organization and carries out the necessary 
inspections of the various activities of the organization in 
Tehran and the provincial centers of which the reports are 
available. Also, the "Auditing organization" has been in charge 
of auditing the financial activities of companies affiliated 
with the organization in the past few years and has presented 
the necessary reports. 
  Based on the existing laws and regulations, various reports 
have been presented to the related authorities, including the 
"auditing and distribution of budget management" of the National 
Accounting office, Article 49 of the Constitution, "Central 
office and Centralization and Combination of Accounts and 
Accounting Methods" of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and 
Finance, the Plan and Budget organization, and the "Economic 
Accounting Office" of the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran. 
<H3>  6. Noncentralized System of the Financial Affairs of the 
Organization </H3>
  The noncentralized financial system of the organization has 
been devised with attention to the administration system and the 
organizational plan of units and centers of the organizations 
approved by the Supervisory Council. 
  This system that is operated in a noncentralized form is an 
accepted scientific system in financial issues and accounting 
that has been used to expedite the implementation of activities 
and prevent bureaucracy and waste of a great deal of time in 
carrying out the various financial affairs of the organization 
throughout the country and it is unlikely that this system will 
be replaced with another financial system, considering the 
scattered nature of the Voice and Vision centers and also the 
variety of the activities of the units of the organization. 
  The fact that the report of the committee states that 
because 
of this system, no information can be obtained concerning the 
activities and accounts of 25 Voice and Vision centers and 
Tehran units is astonishing and questionable, because the 
honorable committee, the National Accounting office, or any 
other authorized organization can refer to the financial books 
of the units and centers to examine the accounts of that unit or 
the radio and television centers independently. Reference to a 
number of accounts of "the financial affairs of the program 
affairs" [as published] and "Tehran Accounting office" [as 
published] in the report of the committee verifies this matter. 
It is unfortunate for this organization that the committee, by 
referring to a small number of financial units of the existing 
45 financial units and by relying on oral information by certain 
persons, has engaged in commenting on the financial situation of 
the whole organization. 
<H5>  The Budget of the Organization </H5>
  The existing records and numerous correspondences that the 
Voice and Vision had with the Plan and Budget organization in 
the course of the imposed war years and later indicate the 
problems stemming from the severe shortage of budget and 
financial resources of the organization. The following figures 
show the trend of the change in the ratified cash budget of the 
organization in the years after the victory of the magnificent 
Islamic revolution and the year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 
1979]: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                                      |Amounts in Millions of Rials          | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Year                                  |Ratified Budget                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979]    |34,303                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980]    |18,681                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981]    |18,756                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982]    |17,246                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983]    |20,010                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984]    |24,110                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985]    |24,550                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1364 [21 March 1985-20 March 1986]    |25,399                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987]    |26,850                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1366 [21 March 1987-20 March 1988]    |21,317                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989]    |26,850                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990]    |28,562                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991]    |42,000                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The above chart shows that the ratified budget of the 
organization in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] is less than 
in 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] and if only the inflation 
factor (based on the annual statistical book of the country) is 
used as the standard in the years after the victory of the 
revolution, in the same year a budget of more than 110 billion 
rials should have been ratified. In other words, in 1368 [21 
March 1989-20 March 1990], without calculating the very high 
increase in the activities of the organization compared to 1357, 
the budget of the organization was ratified at about one-fourth 
of the needed budget, based on the official inflation rates. 
  On the other hand, the current ratified cash budget of the 
organization in the years after the victory of the Islamic 
revolution up to 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] was almost 
equivalent to the paid salaries and benefits of the organization 
in these years. 
  The budget shortage in the years referred to created 
numerous 
problems for the organization. Among them we can point out the 
lack of resources for production of serious programs, the 
creation of obligations and large financial debts, the lack of 
maximal use of studios and transmitters, deterioration of 
buildings and equipment, etc. 
  In 1369, for the first time after the victory of the 
revolution, the budget of the organization was more carefully 
examined under the supervision of the expert committee of the 
Plan and Budget organization, and finally a 42-billion- rial 
budget was ratified. But even this amount has not been 
sufficient for the program production activities planned by the 
organization and technical expansion and operations of the 
organization. Various correspondences in this regard with the 
Plan and Budget organization and the Islamic Guidance and Arts 
and Media Committee of the Majles verify this fact. 
  It should be recalled that about 75 percent of the budget of 
the organization in the years referred to has been spent on 
paying the salaries and benefits for personnel and only 25 
percent of this budget has been unusable in the program 
production division, maintenance of radio and television 
transmitters, and other activities of the organization. 
  The increase in the budget of developmental projects during 
1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] and 1370 [21 March 1991-20 
March 1992] compared to the previous years was merely due to the 
increase in the number of developmental projects and the 
increased coverage of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran throughout Iran and outside the borders. This 
matter has always been emphasized by the grand leader and the 
Majles. 
  In 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], due to the budgetary 
problems of the cultural and media organizations in countering 
cultural invasion and elimination of deprivation, the Majles 
ratified the deduction of 1 percent of the total general 
national budget in 1372 and its allocation to the 
above-mentioned organizations. 
  It would have been logical for the Inquiry and Investigation 
Group to pay attention to the proposal of the Islamic Culture 
and Arts and Media Committee (some of whose members are members 
of the Inquiry and Investigation Group) and the ratification of 
the Majles in this regard before protesting the amount of the 
budget of the organization. 
<H3>  8. Advertisement Debtors and Other Debtors to the 
Organization </H3>
  A) Concerning the debt of persons and prepayments from about 
a few years ago in accordance with a plan, these accounts were 
examined by several groups and every month reports are made and 
prepared and the necessary calculations are made to settle these 
accounts, for which all the records are available and can be 
presented. The debt of persons who have several relations with 
the organization, especially those involved in the past regime, 
have all been announced to the legal office of the organization 
and necessary steps have been taken. Mainly due to lack of 
access to these individuals or their property, in practice the 
collection of the rights of the organization has not been 
possible, and because considering them uncollectible and 
eliminating them from the accounts is contrary to the protection 
of the rights of the Treasury, so far they have remained in the 
accounts as collectible debts to the organization. But 
sufficient reserve has been taken into consideration for these 
accounts. 
  Most of the cases that have been considered by the committee 
under the heading of futile actions include such cases. 
  B) In regards to the advertising debts, prior to the 
revolution, receiving advertisement in credit form was common in 
the organization, and most of these debts are from before the 
revolution. After the revolution, the broadcast of commercials 
from television and radio stopped for some time, and later too 
according to the instructions of the organization advertisements 
were handled in cash in order to protect the rights of the 
organization. In regards to the settlement of previous debts, 
steps have been taken in coordination with the legal office of 
the organization to collect the debts to the organization. A 
number of advertising agencies have been bankrupt and their 
owners of the companies have left the country. In regards to 
debtors who have not been accessible, legal prosecution has been 
made to collect their debts to the organization and results have 
been achieved, the documents for which are available in the 
financial affairs unit of the organization. 
  C) There are also instances that if the organization wants 
to 
bring a suit against them in the country or abroad, it would 
have to spend more than what would be gained. Hence, if the 
collection of the debts of these individuals is verified, the 
appropriate foreign currency and rial budget must be placed at 
the disposal of the organization. 
  D) In regards to the debt of the factories producing 
television in the country, for fees on the rights of expansion, 
the following are important. 
  In the law concerning the collection of fees from producers 
of television reception sets, no special methods have been 
projected to collect the debts of the companies as well as 
late-payment penalties. Hence, at various Junectures in the 
payment of the debt of these companies, considering the economic 
situation and also financial shortages of these companies, which 
are mostly under government control, a halt has been created. 
  In regards to the repayment of late and current debts of 
these companies, the organization has been able to take steps to 
retrieve its rights through special planning with the consent of 
the management of these companies. The records of this matter 
are in the financial offices of the organization. 
  Of course, if a company is unable to meet its obligations, 
the issue is referred to legal authorities for legal claim, 
examples of which are available in the legal office of the 
organization. The last case of a suit was against Pars Electric 
Company. 
  It should be explained that this organization could sue all 
these companies, and in the event that the organization would 
win the case, due to financial problems these companies had to 
shut down and their factories, which would be sold in order for 
the organization to be able to gain its rights. The organization 
accepted the hardship of shortage of resources and the 
statements in the report of the Inquiry and Investigation 
Committee, but did not accept ignoring the rights of thousands 
of the workers of the television manufacturing factories with 
their closure for the sake of getting its own rights immediately. 
  Ultimately, the organization has made all its effort to 
collect these debts in a manner that the numerous financial 
pressures are not imposed on government companies and 
subsequently their hard-working personnel. 
  E) The Inquiry and Investigation Group has criticized the 
organization as to why the funds paid to the Central Bank are 
included in the debit account of the Central Bank, whereas 
according to accepted accounting principles, as long as the 
Central Bank has not acted on its obligation in connection with 
the request of the organization, it must be acted on in this way. 
  At the time the request of the organization is sent, the 
equivalent of the issued check is included in the debit account 
of the Central Bank. When the documents concerning the opening 
of documented credit are delivered to the organization, the 
equivalent of the amount is taken out of the current account of 
the organization and transferred to the credit account of the 
Central Bank. 
  F) The Telfilm Company is one example of debtors to the 
organization. This company was established prior to the 
revolution to produce films and has received a great deal of 
property from the organization. Most of those involved in the 
establishment of this company have escaped abroad since the 
victory of the revolution, and the above-mentioned company has 
practically gone bankrupt. The balances mentioned in 1368 [21 
March 1989-20 March 1990] and 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] 
in the debit account of this company are the debts of those 
involved in its establishment. In regards to retrieving the 
rights of the organization, legal action has been taken. 
  G) The figure concerning the "release of work" of the 
organization all stems from prior to the revolution. A major 
part of the debt to the organization from this person was 
collected after the revolution in cash, but he suddenly became a 
fugitive and left the country. From the early years of the 
revolution, a claim has been made in the Islamic Revolution 
prosecutor's office of Iran. 
  It is noteworthy that the location of one of the warehouses 
of the organizations that belong to him is under the control of 
the organization. With the ruling of the court, the property 
will become the organization's property toward the payment of 
his debts to the organization, and it appears that thereby the 
debt of the person will be collected. 
  H) The foreign currency and real debts of the honorable 
director of the organization are due to the prepayment of extra 
pay for assessment and foreign currency revolving funds, and 
their rial equivalent concern the purchase of coins to be given 
as gifts to the personnel of the organization. Even though the 
nature of these payments must not be regarded as his debt, it 
has been done in this way for accounting purposes. Most of the 
debts referred to in the inquiry and investigation report have 
been included in the expenditures account upon the receipt of 
the assignment report as well as positive documentation in this 
connection, and the remainder of the documents also have been 
presented to the Financial Affairs Office and are in the process 
of being recorded in the books. 
  Of course, other colleagues also have similar debts to the 
organization. But it seems that the Inquiry and Investigation 
Committee, with ill intent, has tried to blow this issue out of 
proportion. 
  I) In regards to the check issued to the Physical Education 
organization, it must be announced that this check was issued 
upon the order of authorized officials of the organization for 
the purchase of land from the Physical Education organization 
and placed at the disposal of the Legal office of the 
organization to sign the contract. But because the Physical 
Education organization refused to accept the contract, the check 
was returned to the Financial Affairs office of the 
organization, and according to document No. 2858, dated 07/06/71 
[29 August 1993], it has been returned from the related accounts. 
  It can be seen that the date of the investigation by the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group is after the above-mentioned 
date. 
  Hence the question in this regard was improper and because 
of 
lack of familiarity by the Inquiry and Investigation Committee 
with financial issues, they were obliged to merely use the 
report of the organization, which was prepared earlier, and have 
therefore made an error. 
  J) In regards to the collection of debts from some former 
manager and officials of radio and television, legal action has 
been taken and the ruling of the court in this regard has also 
been issued. But in the court it has been said that the 
organization must investigate to see if they have land or 
property in Iran in order to issue the ruling based on its 
confiscation. In this connection, too, the organization has 
employed all its efforts. 
<H5>  9. Purchase of Cars From the West of the Country </H5>
  When the opportunity to purchase cars from the west of the 
country arose and the officials and the related organizations 
gave permission to do so, the Voice and Vision organization 
also, like many government organizations, made an effort to 
purchase heavy and light vehicles needed for itself and 
affiliated companies. In this regard, after coordination with 
the center of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran in Sanandaj, the permission for purchase was obtained 
through the office of the governor-general of Kurdistan. 
Considering the unusual procedures for their purchase, the 
auditor of the organization was assigned by the administrative 
and financial affairs deputy director to receive the revolving 
funds and, along with two purchasing officials and experts, to 
be sent there. This was done and after two or three days and 
going to the Marivan border the task was coordinated, and after 
giving the revolving funds to the purchasing officials, he 
returned. 
  Concerning the purchased vehicles, which include light and 
heavy vehicles, no personal use has taken place and the Inquiry 
and Investigation Committee, by presenting a false report and 
without a meeting with the director of the general accounting of 
this organization and quoting him, has announced that two of the 
vehicles were for the personal use of the auditor and the 
administrative and financial deputy director. The reason for the 
revolving funds account not being settled was merely due to the 
existing problems in licensing the vehicles. 
  The reason for the deposit of the funds in the account of 
the 
purchasing official was because the Voice and Vision 
organization did not have a bank account in Marivan. Because of 
the danger in carrying out cash from Sanandaj to Marivan, the 
organization decided to open an account in the name of the 
purchasing official in Marivan. Considering the above 
statements, the falsity of the information by the Inquiry and 
Investigation Committee in the following areas can be proven. 
  1) The administrative and financial affairs deputy director 
of the organization was never sent on assignment in this regard. 
  2) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee never met with 
the 
director of general accounting of the organization and falsified 
information from him. 
  3) None of the cars were employed for personal use. They 
were 
not placed at the disposal of the auditor and the administrative 
and financial affairs deputy director of the organization. 
<H3>  10. Payment of Loans to Employees in the Voice and Vision 
Organization </H3>
  At the present time in the Voice and Vision organization of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran loans are granted from two sources. 
  10.1.) The Savings Fund for Employees, which is provided 
with 
2 percent of the employees' share and 6 percent of the 
organization share and is administered under the supervision of 
a board of trustees. Maximum loan paid from this fund is 120,000 
tomans. 
  10.2) The Retirement Fund, which is funded by 8-percent 
share 
of employees and 16-percent share of the organization and is 
administered under the supervision of the board of trustees of 
the retirement fund. This fund only grants loans for the 
procurement and repair of housing and the marriage of employees. 
The maximum loan from it is 500,000 tomans. 
  The inquiry and investigation reporter has pointed out that 
in the Voice and Vision loans are paid from several sources, but 
no reference is made to its legal obstacles. Not only has the 
organization in no law or regulations been prevented from this 
action, but it has paid loans on the basis of the ratification 
of the Supervisory Council. 
  Loans paid in the Voice and Vision are paid in accordance 
with the laws and regulations to official and contract employees 
and if the borrower is unable to pay the installments of his 
loan on time, the installments will be collected from the 
guarantor. Apparently, this matter was criticized by the Inquiry 
and Investigation Committee as to why no steps are taken to 
collect the rights of the related fund from the guarantor, and 
the group has offered no solution in this area. 
<H5>  11. Withdrawal From Retirement Fund Deposits </H5>
  In regards to the payment of loan from Retirement Fund 
deposits, the issue was examined. The official of the retirement 
fund said that he was not officially contacted and the 
information referred to in the report has been placed at the 
disposal of the committee by individuals who were not 
responsible. 
  In any case, the payment of loans from the Retirement Fund 
to 
the organization has been done on the basis of the regulations 
of the fund through the board of trustees and their approval, 
and there is no legal prohibition. 
  Also, the organization has taken steps to repay the loan in 
question on time. 
  Other instances stated in the Inquiry and Investigation 
Committee report concerning the Retirement Fund lack any basis 
or documented evidence. 
<H5>  12. Assignments Abroad </H5>
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group claims that Voice and 
Vision assignments abroad were not related to its duties and 
mission, whereas the existing information and figures in the 
organization indicate that almost all the assignments abroad by 
the organization have been in connection with news coverage of 
political events, news coverage of the visits of national 
officials, participation in technical and international 
conferences, testing and delivery of purchase transmitters and 
equipment from abroad, production of programs abroad, and 
carrying out training assignments for the personnel, and so on. 
  Elsewhere, the sending of the head of the general affairs of 
programs with a group sent abroad to purchase programs has been 
criticized by the Inquiry and Investigation Committee. Usually, 
in the purchasing group, a representative of the legal office 
and a representative of the financial division for examining the 
contents of the contracts and ensuring the conformity to the 
laws and regulations must be sent. The [director of] general 
affairs for programs on this trip was sent on an assignment as 
the financial affairs representative of the organization. Due to 
severe financial shortages and cutbacks in expenditures, the 
Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran has sometimes 
been forced not to send these two representatives, although 
legally in sending a group for purchases the legal and financial 
representatives of the organization must be present. 
<H5>  13. The List of Banking Discrepancies </H5>
  The existence of banking discrepancies between the accounts 
of every organization and bank statements is inevitable. For 
this reason, one of the accounting statements that is prepared 
at the end of every month by the financial affairs unit of the 
organizations is called the "list of banking discrepancies." In 
other words, after comparing the accounts of the organization 
and the bank statement, the discrepancies are identified and 
steps are taken to correct them. 
  This tactic is done every month by each of the independent 
accounting offices and for each current account, and steps are 
taken to eliminate the discrepancies as much as possible. 
  In regards to the claims concerning failure to give issued 
checks to concerned individuals, it must be announced that this 
claim is a pure lie, because one of the positive evidences of 
this kind of documents is the receiver of the check. If in a 
list the signature of the receiver of the fund or check does not 
exist, the accounting document of payment is not issued, but the 
total amount is put in the credit account of the individual. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Committee has not even 
presented one example in its report to prove this claim. 
<H5>  14. The Account of the General Treasury </H5>
  In regards to the balance of the account of the General 
Treasury at the end of 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] in the 
amount of 21,009,790 rials, it must be said that the balance of 
this account on one date can only indicate the balance remainder 
of the account on that day, and this balance does not show 
failure to deposit the revenues of the organization. 
Unfortunately, the reporter has lacked financial expertise and, 
resorting to this balance, has announced that the revenues of 
the organization have not been deposited in the accounts of the 
Treasury, whereas the revenues of the organization have been 
deposited in the related accounts of the Treasury, then, 
presenting the request for funds from the General Treasury for 
some of the needed financial resources of the organization, a 
withdrawal has been made from these accounts. 
  Considering what is stated, the balance figure in the 
above-mentioned account by no means shows failure to deposit the 
revenues of the organization. 
<H3>  15. Carrying Out Postponed Affairs and Payment for 
Additional Work </H3>
  In various parts of the report of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Committee, certain criticism is made of postponed 
and unsettled accounts. 
  As was announced earlier, about five years earlier, despite 
the shortage of personnel and problems in not absorbing forces 
due to the failure to pay adequate salaries to the expert 
financial forces, by making use of the existing personnel, the 
work on examining the postponed accounts began. All the records 
and related reports in this connection are available in the 
financial affairs office of the organization. Hence, it seems 
that carrying out this task, that is, investigation of the 
postponed accounts, considering the criticism of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Committee concerning failure to do so in numerous 
cases in the report requires commendation, not questioning. 
  Undoubtedly, this case, too, has been cited by individuals 
who have themselves had job and behavior-related problems in the 
Financial Affairs office of the organization, which, 
unfortunately, has been reflected in the report of the committee 
precisely. 
  In connection with the payment of overtime, it must be 
mentioned that overtime in the Voice and Vision organization is 
essentially calculated and paid on the basis of a time card. 
Even in cases in 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] to 1368, due 
to the shortage of funds there was no possibility of paying 
overtime, which the organization employees deserved. (The 
records are available.) 
  Payments of overtime in the organization have been carried 
out in accordance with the laws, regulations, and internal 
bylaws of the organization. 
<H5>  16. Revolving Funds </H5>
  The revolving funds of the organization are mainly related 
to 
the representative offices abroad. Due to the continuation of 
their activities, the balance of these offices will never be 
zero at the end of the year. Funds that are transferred to the 
representative offices of the organization abroad are all 
recorded in the revolving fund account of the manager of the 
office and the equivalent in foreign currency for the documents 
delivered is sent to the representative office by the manager of 
the office. Hence, the revolving fund of the managers of the 
offices will never reach zero, unless a new person is appointed 
in his place. In this case, after examination and auditing the 
inventory and giving it over to the new official, the balance is 
transferred into the account of the new manager. 
  As it has been announced in the report of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Committee, in some cases, with the written 
permission of the auditor of the organization, payment of 
revolving funds over 500,000 rials is also permitted. Hence, all 
the revolving funds are paid with the permission of the auditor 
of the organization or agents of the auditor in Tehran and the 
provincial centers, and there is no legal prohibition in this 
regard. 
<H5>  17. The Fund and Its Evaluation </H5>
  The nature of the work of the cashier and numerous accounts 
receivable and accounts payable in the course of a day, week, or 
month makes the existence of account discrepancies inevitable, 
and for this reason the cashiers are [extended] extra pay to 
make up for the shortage of cash. 
  In the Voice and Vision organization, only in a small number 
of units (considering the nature of their work) is permission 
given to have a fund, and most payments are made with bank 
drafts. 
  The accounts of each of the cashiers at various Junectures 
are examined and counted by the evaluation and financial affairs 
activities group of the organization, and the shortages of funds 
are included in the debit account of the cashier and deducted 
from his salary. Hence, the expression of opinion in this 
regard, stating that the accounts of the cashiers are never 
evaluated and audited, is a pure fabrication. (The periodic 
evaluations and audits of cashiers are available in the [office 
of] Financial Affairs of the organization.) 
  In very rare cases, considering the volume of the activities 
of the cashier, the accuracy of his actions and reports of the 
financial affairs activities evaluation of the organization, 
within the possible resources, approved funds may be provided as 
aid for the cashier's deficit, upon the approval of the proper 
authorities of the organization. 
<H5>  18. Other Cases </H5>
  Health payments of the organization are handled on the basis 
of the health regulations of the organization. In some cases, 
because the patient does not have the ability to pay his share, 
with a social aid report and the approval of a three-member 
committee on this matter and ultimately the approval of the 
proper authorities of the organization, his share can be 
provided from the aid budget of the organization, instances of 
which do not even exceed 1 percent of patients. 
  Advances for employees in an organization with more than 
14,000 permanent and temporary personnel are inevitable, and 
such prepayments and their procedures are as follows. 
  Salary advances. Considering the issue of advances, they are 
either deposited all at once after the establishment of the 
salary of the new personnel from what is owed him or in 
installments (usually within a maximum period of one year) and 
deducted from the employee's salary. 
  Assignment advances. Such advances are deposited all at once 
from the debit account of the official after the assignment 
report is presented. 
  Payment of loans to employees who have no employment 
(official or contractual) relations is impossible and contrary 
to the regulations and internal bylaws of the organization. 
Hence, the mere claim that it has happened does not prove it to 
be true. Obviously, for every (qualified) individual to whom the 
organization grants a loan, in accordance with the regulations, 
he must present a person as his guarantor. Naturally, the 
responsibilities of the guarantor are clear in terms of the laws 
and regulations. 
  The organization is asked why others to whom the 
organization 
has debt have not come to collect. 
  As to why a person to whom money is owed has not come to the 
organization to collect it, it is not the problem of the Voice 
and Vision organization and its financial affairs to respond. 
  [11 Nov pp 10, 14] 
  [Text] Following the publication of two parts of the Voice 
and Vision response to the critical report of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group of the Majles, now we publish the third and 
final part of this report for our dear readers. 
<H5>  Labor Force Report </H5>
  In connection with the labor force, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group writes: 
  "The quantitative and qualitative presence of the 
prerevolutionary cadre and lack of basic change in the body of 
the Voice and Vision" [sentence as published]. 
  The group continues: "The Voice and Vision is a center with 
about 14,000 personnel, most of whom have remained in place from 
the past regime. Despite the fact that, like other 
organizations, it has been purged, the composition of the major 
part of the organization has not essentially changed. Even the 
absorption of Hezbollah elements, due to the governing climate, 
has not been able to create fundamental change, and they have 
either become dependent on the governing climate, have changed, 
or have chosen to be silent." 
  Voice and Vision response: First, the Voice and Vision in 
letter No. M/2300/633/5160, dated 13/08/1371 [4 November 1992], 
had sent the personnel information (list of individuals who left 
the organization from 1358 [21 March 1979-20 March 1980] and a 
list of those who have been hired from 1360 [21 March 1981-20 
March 1982] to that date) to the Inquiry and Investigation Group. 
  Second, after the victory of the Islamic revolution: 
  About 2,328 people, due to ideological affiliations or lack 
of the necessary moral and political qualifications for service 
in the Voice and Vision, have been dismissed from the 
organization and about 1,844 have been honored by retirement or 
left the system due to disability or other problems. In other 
words, about 4,200 persons have left the organization, and 
during the same period the Voice and Vision organization has 
hired about 7,500 full-time official and contractual and about 
2,000 part-time employees. 
  In other words, of the total of about 14,500 present 
employees, about 9,500 have been newly employed and about 5,000 
are the former employees of the organization, and naturally the 
new forces are all graduates of the schools, colleges, and 
universities of the country after the victory of the revolution 
or from the students of religious seminaries. Also, the 
remainder of the forces from before the victory of the Islamic 
revolution are all sincere, committed, Muslim forces, those 
interested in the revolution and Islam, and those loyal to the 
sacred regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who have served 
and are serving Islam and the revolution. 
  Third, nearly all the officials of the regime unanimously 
believe that those who have been ideologically and politically 
affiliated with the previous regime have been purged in the 
first few years after the victory of the Islamic revolution from 
offices or have left the country and crawled into some corner. 
  In the 15th year of the victory of the Islamic revolution, 
at 
a sensitive Junecture when the country is undergoing a period of 
construction and reconstruction, raising issues such as the 
forces from before or after the revolution or the new and old 
will have no results but to create disunity and conflicts in the 
offices. 
  While so far every employee has been purged for whatever 
reason for which he should have been purged and those who have 
remained or those who have been absorbed after the victory of 
the Islamic revolution by the offices are no different, they 
have been and are all servants of the people and loyal to the 
revolution, Islam, and the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group states in its report: 
"The organization has 14,000 personnel, most of whom are left 
over from the past regime." 
  Voice and Vision response: As was stated, about two-thirds 
of 
the employees of the organization are individuals who have 
started working with the organization after the victory of the 
revolution, and the claim of this group is contrary to the facts. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group in continuation, while 
insulting the Hezbollah elements, writes: "The Hezbollah 
elements have either become dependent on the climate, have 
changed, or have chosen to remain silent!" It then continues: 
"Among the managers, proper changes have been made, but 
sometimes we witness the inappropriate activities of some of 
these managers who have been influenced by the existing climate 
in the organization." 
  Voice and Vision response: Considering what was said, about 
two-thirds of the forces in the organization are forces from 
after the victory of the Islamic revolution, and according to 
the Inquiry and Investigation Group among the managers proper 
changes have taken place. 
  Then, how can this contradiction be accepted, that a 
minority 
influences the majority in this way and has changed their ideas? 
  Indeed, why has the Inquiry and Investigation Group tried in 
its report to weaken the, as it says itself, committed, 
concerned Muslim managers and committed Muslim employees? Can it 
not be believed that in this case, too, as in other cases, the 
group has deviated from the position of impartiality and ignored 
the facts? 
  But why have they not taken an oath on the Koran before God 
to observe trust by relying on their honor? 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group continues: "Old 
elements, 
due to their intellectual opposition to the Islamic regime and 
the revolution, protect the interests of those in the same line, 
too. In understanding this point, several examples are referred 
to and in continuation they have reported a few examples that 
are either untrue or, as they have said themselves, whose 
occurrence was prevented by the management of the organization, 
which, contrary to the claim of the group that says Hezbollah 
elements or some of the managers were changed, proves the 
sensitivity, decisiveness, and alertness of the committed 
managers and employees of the organization. 
  For example, they have said: "Two of the hosts of the Voice 
and Vision, despite their apparent justifiable appearance, have 
misused their position to receive resources from the 
organizations and after the exposure of a film from which their 
immorality is revealed were dismissed and unfortunately rehired 
in the Vision." 
  Voice and Vision response: These individuals have never 
misused any organization and have devoted a significant 
percentage of their lives on the fronts of the battle of truth 
against falsehood. The film that is referred to was 
participation in a wedding in which Islamic standards were not 
observed. As was explained in the newspapers earlier, they have 
never been dismissed from the organization because they had not 
committed any crime that would deserve their being fired. 
  Or it has been said that in the program "Friday Morning," a 
host of the program has been invited who has had relations with 
SAVAK agents, or they have invited a showman from the tyrant's 
time and the director of the organization has prevented his 
entry. The first is untrue and the second shows the sensitivity 
and alertness of the management. 
  They have shown sensitivity towards one of the actors in the 
serial, "Primrose," which was explained earlier. 
  They have said: They have purchased a film and because it 
was 
antireligious have stopped its broadcast. We do not know if the 
criticism is due to the preventing of the broadcast and the 
alertness of the officials of this medium or something else. 
  They have said: An interview was broadcast with a Sunni 
cleric who, it was later revealed, has had problems. Not knowing 
about everyone or the future of others is something obvious, and 
when it was investigated by the proper authorities, it became 
clear that there had been an error, not ill intentions. They 
have said: One of the news anchormen did not read the news of 
the death of the Imam and another read it emotionally, but what 
they have not said is that the first person was so upset because 
of this great loss that no matter how he tried, because of his 
great love for the Imam, he could not read it, rather than "not 
wanting to read it." And they have said that Mr. Hayati, who 
read it, was ridiculed and scolded by his colleagues. This is a 
pure lie. 
  They have said: In the program "Friday Morning," the Prophet 
was insulted." They have mentioned an example that has never 
been broadcast from the radio. The broadcast from the radio was, 
"A person claimed to be God. He was told someone has claimed to 
be a Prophet. He said, I did not send him." (A similar story is 
mentioned in martyr Motahhari's book.) 
  And similar to such issues, which are either rare or the 
reverse or show the sensitivity of the managers, we must say 
that in regard to some of these cases that have actually 
occurred, when they have been investigated it has been decided 
that there has never been ill intent, but the result of an 
error, and that, moreover, the management of the organization 
has dealt with the error appropriately at the time. This is an 
issue that is mentioned in the Inquiry and Investigation Group's 
report explicitly and in some cases not explicitly. 
  In another part of the report, the group indicates 
sensitivity to the serial "Ra'na." 
  The audience of the Voice and Vision remember well that the 
serial "Ra'na" is one of the serials that beautifully shows 
certain parts of the Islamic revolution, in particular the 
constructive effect of the Islamic revolution and the Hezbollah 
on a stratum which paid no attention to the issues of the 
revolution or in families in which there were people who were 
afraid of the buried regime of the shah. 
  So, at the end of the serial "Ra'na," the young educated 
girls of this family choose the "chador" as their veil and also 
some of the women of this family and men who have given up their 
previous way of life return to the bosom of Islam and the 
revolution. In the opinion of the officials of the Voice and 
Vision, this serial was an actual example of what the late Imam 
said concerning the mission of the Voice and Vision: "The Voice 
and Vision is a nationwide public university." 
  Which university can, while filling the leisure hours of the 
people, show the history of the revolution and create internal 
change in its students or audience? 
  It is not clear to us why the Inquiry and Investigation 
Group, despite what the Imam said concerning the responsibility 
of the Voice and Vision, repeating frequently that the Voice and 
Vision must work for the revolution and Islam, has divided the 
programs in its fabricated categorization, "in connection with 
Islam and the revolution as indifferent, neutral and deviant," 
when they have given examples and showed their negative 
sensitivity mainly to programs that were endorsed by the late 
Imam, the grand leader, the high-ranking officials, and the 
Muslim and Hezbollah nation or programs that have exposed the 
crimes of the criminal Americans, the usurping Zionists or 
deceptive and disgraced British. 
  Here it is necessary to point out that, as the officials of 
the Voice and Vision have announced frequently from the mass 
media, including the Voice and Vision, we have never believed 
and do not believe that no mistakes were made in the programs of 
the Voice and Vision or that nothing has occurred contrary to 
other people's tastes, because in an organization that annually 
produces and broadcasts more than 90,000 hours of radio and 
television programs to the farthest areas of the country, there 
are not only errors, but it is also impossible for all the 
programs to be accepted and not criticized by people with 
various tastes. 
  Various and numerous statistics and polls show that most of 
the criticism of the programs of the Voice and Vision is due to 
different tastes, because the audience of the Voice and Vision 
ranges from two-year-old children to the oldest members of the 
society and from the illiterate to the most learned, in short, 
all the strata and people in the society, as well as beyond the 
borders, audiences who have different intellectual, political, 
and social backgrounds. 
  Hence, differences of opinion and taste concerning the 
programs of the Voice and Vision are obvious, natural, and 
normal. What is important is that during the 12 years of service 
of the present managers of the organization, the general 
direction of the programs not only has been in line with Islam, 
the revolution, and the Islamic values of the society, but has 
had a consistent movement towards improvement and reform. With 
the special attention and continuous and sincere supervision of 
the late Imam during his blessed and history-making life and now 
the grand leader, the pious successor of the late Imam, the 
officials of the Voice and Vision have always been able to 
correct any error that may have occurred, though rarely, on time 
and to deal with it. 
  Concerning the leaning of the Satellite Building, which 
resulted in its destruction and that of much of the satellite 
equipment, it must be said: Based on the report of qualified 
technical experts, damage to this building was the result of an 
earthquake with a vertical strike... With this logic, the 
Gilan and Zanjan earthquake is also probably blamed on the 
managers of the Voice and Vision in those provinces. 
  And for this reason they have always been endorsed by the 
late Imam and the grand leader of the Islamic revolution, some 
of which are pointed out here: 
  1) The late Imam, on 17/12/1370 [8 March 1992] in an 
audience 
granted to the general manager and the technical and expansion 
employees of the radio and television network of the Voice and 
Vision organization, said: "You young people succeeded in 
shattering the false beliefs." 
  2) On 15 Mordad 1361 [7 August 1982], when one year had 
passed in the service of the present managers of the Voice and 
Vision, in a meeting with the general manager and officials of 
various divisions of the Voice and Vision, while emphasizing the 
necessity and importance of reforming the Voice and Vision, he 
said: "I kept repeating this matter to the individuals who were 
in charge of these affairs and are at the top of this issue, but 
later it became clear that they were improper people. They kept 
making excuses that they are busy with it and are correcting it 
and it cannot be done and so on. But now, thank God, we see that 
it is being done, and we hope that with the efforts of this 
honorable gentleman, `Mr. Rafsanjani,' and the brother of `Mr. 
Rafsanjani,' God willing, the problems will be corrected and 
these two brothers, God willing, will serve Islam and its 
friends. This one in propaganda and the other in everything." In 
conclusion, addressing all those present, he said, "I ask God 
Almighty for your health and prosperity and thank you for your 
hard work and hope you work even harder, work for Islam. We who 
are from God must use our time for God..." 
  In the events of 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] of the 
Voice and Vision organization, the Imam, God rest his soul, once 
again declared his trust in the management of the Voice and 
Vision. 
  His honor, in his blessed letter dated 4 Tir 1364 [25 June 
1985], wrote: 
  In the name of God, the compassionate and the merciful. 
  Contrary to expectations, in the Voice and Vision of the 
Islamic Republic conflicts occurred that caused concern. 
Consequently, I appoint Mr. Mohammad Hashemi as my 
representative to take charge of the responsibilities as the 
general manager of the Voice and Vision, so that this large 
organization will not be without a director; and because the 
honorable Supervisory Council has some concerns and some of them 
have written to me, and also Mr. Hashemi has some concerns, it 
is necessary for the honorable president, the honorable head of 
the Supreme Court, the honorable speaker of the Majles, and the 
honorable prime minister to examine the issues of both sides 
without the slightest connivance, and make the final decision. 
It is necessary to mention that it has been heard that some in 
my household have done some things contrary to my wishes or 
without informing me. Because this matter is untrue, the person 
saying such things must repent before God. 4 Tir 1362 [25 June 
1983], Ruhollah Khomeyni 
  Also, at every juncture and opportunity, the late Imam, 
while 
expressing contentment with the programs of the Voice and Vision 
and emphasizing more effort by the managers and officials, 
offered destiny-making directives. Finally, on 29 Azar 1366 [20 
December 1987], when a number of people were trying to show the 
programs of the organization as without content, contrary to 
religious law, unsuitable, etc., this wise sage who always 
profoundly supervised the programs of this organization said: 
"Watching such films and plays has no religious problems and 
many of them are instructive and their broadcast is also no 
problem and in the same way the music is for the most part no 
problem. Sometimes, on occasion, violations are seen, so more 
care must be taken." 
  And here to be offered is an implemental directive: "Those 
who put on makeup must be among those who are not legally 
allowed to marry the person; a foreigner is prohibited from 
doing this." 
  "Makeup" is an implemental issue, but when the Imam was 
asked 
how he noticed this problem, he responded: I watched the credits 
of the program (the word credits is ours, he said a sentence 
that referred to credits), and sometimes there are men or women 
actors but there is no mention of the makeup person of the same 
sex. Of course, most often it is given. Nevertheless, I made a 
remainder that if "a person is potentially legally allowed to 
marry the other, it is prohibited." 
  This point shows that the late Imam carefully paid attention 
to the activities of the officials of the Voice and Vision and 
when he would see a violation, he would mention and announce it. 
Hence, in Azar 1366 [22 November-21 December 1987] he announced: 
"The showing of none of the programs is problematic in terms of 
religious law and also sports films as well as songs are mostly 
no problem. Sometimes violations are seen, though rarely, so 
more care must be taken." 
  This letter by the Imam is a strong endorsement of the 
activities of the officials of the Voice and Vision for seven 
years and shows the constant and profound supervision of that 
late wise sage, the maker of history and founder of the sacred 
regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran, during his blessed life. 
  As has been stated in the report of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group, the grand leader of the Islamic revolution, 
too, from 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] to now, "has made 
14 reminders to the officials of the Voice and Vision in 
connection with the programs of the Voice and Vision." 
  The reminders of his reverence are also another indication 
of 
the constant and wise supervision of the grand leader of the 
Islamic revolution, the pious successor to the late Imam. The 
officials of the Voice and Vision, as they did during the Imam's 
life, who made every effort to eliminate the problems that were 
pointed out by his honor and in this way were able to receive 
the full endorsement of this wise sage for almost all of their 
programs. 
  [Paragraphing as published] now too use their best efforts 
to 
eliminate the problems that are mentioned in the reminders and 
wise directives of the grand leader and have taken steps in 
every instance which thank God have been accepted by him. We ask 
God Almighty for help to be able to sincerely and fully 
implement his profound directives and in our actions gain the 
contentment of God Almighty, God willing. 
<H5>  Management of the Organization </H5>
  Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group in continuing the 
report deals with the management of the organization and first 
says: "Although the managers and cultural directors of the Voice 
and Vision are well-known cultural figures in the country and at 
the lower levels too committed and concerned managers are the 
majority especially in various groups of Networks 1 and 2, the 
question arises as to why the criticism and protest in regards 
to the programs of the Voice and Vision are increasing?" 
  Voice and Vision response: First, the managers of the Voice 
and Vision, on all levels and in all units, including the Voice 
and Vision, all the deputy directors' offices, headquarter 
units, provincial centers, offices abroad, and service and 
logistics units, have been and are without exception religious, 
committed, concerned, active Muslims, loyal to the sacred regime 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  It is necessary here to make a delicate point. When the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group came to the General Security 
office to investigate the managers of the organization and asked 
for the files of the managers, the director general of security 
placed 150 volumes of files of the managers at their disposal. 
They began to leaf through them and examine them. When the 
brilliant history, high education, and especially the volunteer 
work and active and unassuming presence of 136 senior managers 
of the organization at the fronts of the battle of truth against 
falsehood during the imposed war was seen, one of the members of 
the Inquiry and Investigation Group became extremely despondent 
and kicked the files and said: What sort of records are these 
that you are showing me? Are you ridiculing us? He then left the 
room angrily. 
  In connection with financial misuse and moral corruption, 
the 
director of security has said: I cannot make up documents as you 
demand. So the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group 
became very angry and then the security file placed at their 
disposal was thrown in some corner. 
  The director general of security became very astonished at 
this reaction of a member of the group. Why should a deputy of 
the Majles be so upset by the active presence of the senior 
managers of a sensitive organization of the country on the war 
fronts? 
  Have these managers, who on the one hand have worked day and 
night on the most important propaganda front of the country at 
the same time used every opportunity to build themselves and 
repledge with the combatants of the military front against 
falsehood, have hurried towards them, and have even been proud 
of doing manual work and any sort of support, caused such 
reactions in a deputy of the people, even though they have 
hurried to the front as unknown soldiers to pay their debt on 
the basis of religious duty and to build themselves in the 
spiritual circles of the combatants on the front line and their 
reward is with their beloved [God] and nothing else? What is the 
meaning of this reaction of a member of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group? 
  We remember precisely that when the late Imam instructed 
going to the front, as the committed managers and employees of 
this organization declared their readiness and registered 
hastily for the path of their beloved, there was fear of 
stoppage and closure of many of the units of this organization. 
Hence, we had to ask the Imam for instructions, and his honor 
said to the officials of this medium, especially those who serve 
in sensitive positions, that they should remain at their jobs 
and carry out their duties, for this is also a very great duty. 
  Continuing the discussion about the present management, the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group has regretted the fact in the 
introduction of which it has praised the managers and in the 
following pages tries to destroy the managers, and for that 
matter, with accusations for almost all of which they present no 
evidence, except probably what they have heard through "tangible 
and intangible ways." Below we refer to some and briefly respond 
to them. 
  1) They write: "Tyrannical artists, in order to prevent the 
spread of Islamic culture, have revealed themselves to the 
managers and, until some time ago they had convinced everyone 
that Islamic cover, that is, the chador, causes technical 
problems in front of the camera." 
  First, this is a pure lie, because since the early days of 
the revolution hundreds, even thousands, of programs, 
interviews, and reports in which women with chadors have been 
present have been produced and broadcast, which have been 
witnessed by everyone from the Vision. 
  Second, Islamic cover is not only the chador. Islam has 
restrictions and limits regarding women's covering, which 
clearly all the religious jurists by interpreting the Koran have 
explained in the scholarly dissertations and other religious 
jurisprudent and Islamic sources. For the informed people it is 
clear that Islamic covering is not only the "chador"; any form 
of cover that provides religious covering for women on the basis 
of the standards of the sacred religious law is Islamic covering. 
  2) They say: "In the foreign unit of the Voice and Vision, 
weak management has caused individuals even from the embassies 
to operate the foreign unit, some of whom have even been spies." 
  Here, too, as in many other instances, they have also lied 
about the foreign unit and the committed Muslim forces of other 
countries who serve the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic in 
this unit without any document or evidence. Unfortunately, due 
to considerations of the interests of the country and this group 
of colleagues, we cannot give any more explanation about them, 
and these dear ones are even "oppressed" in our response. God 
willing, under more suitable conditions we will be able to 
introduce them. 
  3) They have said that the manager of one of the units has 
made a case against four Hezbollah elements last year and 
presented it to the Violations Court. The crime of the Hezbollah 
elements was protesting the illegitimate relationship between 
several employees and one employee. 
  Voice and Vision response: This issue too, like other cases, 
is a pure lie. No such record exists in the Violations Committee 
[as published], and we do not know how, if the Inquiry and 
Investigation Committee believes in Islamic morality, it can 
accuse several people of having "illegitimate relations" with 
one person without investigation and proof. Is the publication 
of such untrue instances not spreading of debauchery? Is it not 
a crime punishable from a judicial perspective? Should not the 
honorable officials of the Judicial Branch investigate such 
crimes immediately and punish the spreaders of debauchery? God 
willing, it will be so. 
  4) They write: "A person who, because of relations with 
deviant individuals, has been dismissed from the institution (it 
has not been stated which institution) and then arrested and has 
had conflicts with Hezbollah individuals is now the manager of 
the Voice and Vision of one of the provinces. 
  To back this claim, the group has not given the slightest 
information from any authority to this organization, and hence 
it is a pure lie. 
  5) They have written: The manager of one of the offices 
abroad, apparently propagates deviant ideas and criticizes the 
ideas of martyr Motahhari... 
  We neither know anything about him nor the sources of 
information that they have given (the same intangible source 
which was mentioned), and again it is a pure lie. 
  6) Without presenting any evidence, they have claimed that 
financial misuse occurs in the serials. If only they could send 
us even one document or one example. 
  7) They have said: In 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], 
the 
property of the Voice and Vision was stolen and after 
investigation it was found that the related manager had a hand 
in it. The issued ruling about the related manager who was 
supported by the director of the organization was not carried 
out but the secondary elements were dismissed and the related 
manager was dismissed respectfully after a long time for moral 
corruption. 
  Voice and Vision response: In this case, we need to explain 
more than the previous cases: 
  A) The manager who is mentioned is among the employees who 
has been known for his commitment and being a Muslim from before 
the victory of the revolution, and in Bahman 1357 [21 January-19 
February 1979] during the arrival of the Imam in the country, 
despite the opposition of the radio and television organization 
at the time, by using a mobile television unit, directly 
broadcast the ceremonies of the arrival and the welcoming of the 
Imam of the people. As the Islamic nation knows, the broadcast 
of these ceremonies was cut off from the Voice and Vision 
center, but he provided the pictures for one of the most 
important events of the Islamic world in motion. 
  B) In the Refah School, the residence of the Imam, he was 
given an important assignment to create the revolution 
television channel and directly broadcast the meetings of the 
Imam with another dear engineer, who in the organization was a 
student friend of martyr Raja'i and most favored by him, and 
during the first term of his premiership and presidency was one 
of the trustees of martyr Raja'i and cooperated with him. He is 
now the deputy director of the organization. In the inquiry and 
investigation report he has been the target of much exaggerated 
unkindness! And every unfair slander for which they have not 
found a source is ascribed to him. 
  C) Among the other activities of this manager, when the 
missile attacks on Tehran began and it was decided to keep the 
schools closed and for the television to produce and broadcast 
school programs, he accepted this grave responsibility and 
during the above-mentioned time produced and broadcast 
educational programs for schools without leaving the 
organization, which was one of the vital centers and a target of 
Saddam's supporters for a while. 
  [D)] During the years of the imposed war, he went to the 
front line frequently and organized numerous reports. 
  E) At the time the late Imam passed away and during the 
anniversary of these ceremonies, he made every possible effort 
to carry on these ceremonies in a most appropriate manner. 
  F) In the Hajj ceremonies this year, he broadcast via 
international satellite from inside Saudi Arabia the ceremonies 
of the exemption of the infidels most skillfully, intelligently, 
and cleverly, which is beautifully characteristic of a committed 
Muslim. 
  First, the Government of Saudi Arabia denied the exemption 
of 
infidels, but when its pictures were broadcast on most of the 
world televisions, including the Islamic Republic, they were 
forced to confess. 
  The broadcast of these ceremonies from world television 
angered the rulers of Saudi Arabia and caused the joy of 
hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world, including the 
Muslim people of our country. 
  As the group has pointed out, in 1369 [21 March 1990-20 
March 
1991] the organization learned that one of the cameras of the 
organization was put on sale in a store on one of the streets in 
Tehran. 
  The director of the organization requested that the public 
prosecutor of Tehran help find the perpetrators and return the 
property of the organization. 
  With the help of the Tehran public prosecutor, the elements 
were identified and the stolen property was all returned. 
  Because the above-mentioned manager was also a suspect, he 
was introduced to the prosecutor's office and his case was 
examined in the prosecutor's office. But the cases of the rest 
of the individuals who were official or part-time employees of 
the organization were examined by the administrative violations 
unit of the organization and, appropriate to their crimes, the 
rulings were issued and carried out. But the above-mentioned 
manager was acquitted in the court and was obliged to pay 50,000 
tomans. At this time, some of the mediating elements who were 
affiliated with some political currents or some particular 
persons in the organization as well, protested the issued 
ruling. The Supreme Court revoked the ruling and the case was 
sent to another branch for reexamination. In the second court, 
also, the innocence of this manager was proven, and with a 
reduction in payment to 10,000 tomans, the case was closed. It 
is interesting that the camera of the organization was also 
returned earlier by the prosecutor's office. 
  The officials of the related court observed in the file that 
the director of the organization has complained about him and 
requested the organization to declare its opinion considering 
the present situation of the case. The director of the 
organization in a letter announced that the organization has no 
complaint due to fully retrieving the rights of the 
organization, the case was closed, and the bail documents have 
been released. 
  Other instances of which he is accused in the report are 
merely accusations and have not been proven by any authority. He 
has not even been dismissed for one moment from the organization 
or his responsibility and continues to serve the organization 
most sincerely and with continuous effort. Even because of his 
skills and sincerity, he has been requested for assistance 
during his leisure time by one of the very sensitive 
organizations of the country, and this organization, because of 
its respect for that organization, has agreed to the 
above-mentioned request. At the present time, in addition to 
carrying out his previous responsibilities in the organization 
he spends his leisure time, unofficial time, and even holidays 
working in the other organization. 
  In the Hajj ceremonies this year, due to the significant 
efforts in the intolerable heat of Saudi Arabia and because of 
service to the world of Islam in sending the pictures of the 
ceremonies of exemption of infidels via international satellite, 
he was commended by the representative of the grand leader and 
the supervisor of Iranian Hajj pilgrims. 
  Now, why the Inquiry and Investigation Group has shown such 
sensitivity towards him and another engineer in the organization 
(educational deputy director, with a brief description of his 
services, which was mentioned) and reported untruth is unclear 
to us. 
  After the publication of the report of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group, those who stir up trouble have called from 
here and there saying, "You deserve what you get, go ahead and 
work as hard as you can for this regime!" 
  In the continuation of the report, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group discusses the security situation of the 
Voice and Vision and raises issues that again, like most of the 
other instances, are accusations and even pure lies or 
concerning what, for reasons of consideration for the interests 
of the country and security, we cannot give any explanation. We 
only refer to one point, which indicates the proper and strong 
activities of the security unit of the organization, which is, 
despite the hostility of the enemies towards this sensitive 
center and despite the fact that in every conspiracy against the 
regime that has been discovered, the destruction and occupation 
of the Voice and Vision as one of the vital centers of the 
country has been among the primary targets of the conspirators, 
under the auspices of the alertness and active and 
self-sacrificing presence of the security forces of the 
organization, thank God, so far none of the conspiracies of the 
enemies have succeeded in regards to this organization and have 
all beem stifled and neutralized in their embryonic stages. 
  In this connection, we find it necessary to thank and praise 
the unknown soldiers of the Imam of the Age. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group in the continuation of 
the report examines and compares the laws of the organization 
with the statements of the grand leader and says: 
"Unfortunately, the instructions and directives of his honor 
have not been implemented." And then it refers to the following 
few instances. 
  A) In a decree appointing Mr. Mohammad Hashemi as the 
director of the organization, he was asked to rapidly prepare a 
bill concerning the administration of the Voice and Vision and 
present it to the government and the Majles for ratification. So 
far, it has not been done. 
  Voice and Vision response: The above-mentioned bill was 
prepared and presented to the government at the first 
opportunity and the government also in its committee on bills 
examined and prepared it to be sent to the honorable Majles. At 
that time, some of the Majles deputies who had learned about the 
content of the bill hurriedly prepared and offered a proposal 
with a few signatures to the Majles and told us that in 
accordance with the internal bylaws of the Majles, the proposal 
that has been registered first is given priority and until six 
months after the ratification, no other proposal can be 
discussed. 
  Because the above-mentioned proposal was prepared hastily, 
even after correction in the second round of discussions it was 
ratified with some problems in the honorable Majles, but the 
honorable Council of Guardians found some problems in it and 
returned it to the Majles. The Majles refused to accept all the 
problems and ultimately the proposal was sent to the Council for 
the Discernment of Expediency. In the Council for the 
Discernment of Expediency, the proposal was commended and to 
some extent the problems were eliminated and it was announced 
for implementation, and it is now being implemented in the 
organization. 
  We do not know on the basis of which standards indeed they 
have allowed themselves to make unjust and untrue accusations 
against individuals. Are there no judicial punishments for these? 
  2) The Inquiry and Investigation Group has said that from 
1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] to 1370 [21 March 1991-20 
March 1992], in 14 instances the grand leader has made reminders 
to the Voice and Vision concerning the programs, the most 
important of which are: 
  A) Misleading and low quality of programs to be broadcast 
abroad. 
  Voice and Vision response: Careful attention has been paid 
to 
the directives of his honor and the necessary steps have been 
taken in order to avoid the particular instances that were 
mentioned in regards to misleading. Also, vast efforts have been 
made to increase the quality of the foreign Islamic intellectual 
programs. In this connection, it should be mentioned that vast 
cooperation with about 160 young, active, and virtuous seminary 
students in Qom has begun and the grand leader is aware of this 
action. 
  H) [Numbering as published] In regards to the broadcast of 
blasphemous sentences concerning the Sire of the Pious, such as 
"Allah, Our Sire, 'Ali," as you know, the poem is by Mowlavi and 
the organization for the second broadcast of the song has 
changed the praise to "Our Sir, Our Sire, 'Ali," and then issued 
permission for its broadcast. 
  5) [as published] Showing actual persons in the role of the 
infallible imams. 
  Voice and Vision response: In this case, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group has reported falsely, because such an 
instance has not occurred on television. But the situation was 
that in a play that was broadcast about his holiness, Imam 
Mohammad Baqer, the face of the narrator, who was a companion of 
the Imam, was designed very beautifully and brilliantly, which 
created doubt for some people that the narrator was in the role 
of an infallible one and hence they had written to the grand 
leader. His honor mentioned the matter to the organization and 
naturally, because in this case actual persons had not appeared 
in the role of the infallible ones, there was no problem. 
  F) [as published] Not broadcasting repeated sad films in 
special cases, and the decree of his honor is implemented fully. 
  It can be seen that his honor, too, like his pious 
predecessor, that is, the late Imam, continuously makes 
reminders about any problem, even if it is "one sentence," to 
the Voice and Vision, the total of which, as witnessed by the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group from 1368 [21 March 1989-20 
March 1990] to 1370 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] were 14 
instances, the most important of which were quoted. 
  It is noteworthy that the Voice and Vision has made its 
utmost effort to carry out the reminders and directives of his 
honor in a most expedient manner. The fact that during this 
period, the grand leader, with his precision and cultural, 
religious, political, and social competence--and, as it was 
said, he has not even ignored one sentence that was in 
violation--shows that of course in personal meetings of the 
officials, while giving them directives, he has also expressed 
his contentment. 
  G) [as published] The Inquiry and Investigation Group in the 
continuation of this section refers to the violation of the laws 
and regulations of the organization by the director of the 
organization and says: "According to the head of the Policy 
Making Council, most of these ratifications are not announced to 
the concerned units by the honorable director of the 
organization." We doubt this to be the statement of the 
honorable head of the Policy Making Council, because immediately 
and regularly the copies of the announcements are sent to him. 
  Continuing the report, the group says, "In examining the 
activities of the organization and their conformity with the 
laws, as well, we come across problems that indicate 
noncompliance with legal matters, and they are stated in 
instances 2, 2 [sentence as published], 21, 23, 27, 30, 33, 45, 
46, and 62." Because we do not know about these instances, we 
cannot respond. But in considering the rest of the instances in 
the report, it is certain that these numbers are only meant to 
fill paper and serve as a sort of psychological war. The group 
has referred to some instances of not observing some of the 
articles of the charter of the Voice and Vision organization, 
  [Paragraphing in the original] which are contrary to facts, 
because first, the general manager, when the Supervisory Council 
existed presented the report of activities in accordance with 
the regulations to the Supervisory Council. Whether the 
Supervisory Council reported it to the Council of the heads of 
the three branches or not does not concern the organization. The 
number of the deputy director areas of the organization is six, 
but the number of units that are under the authority of the 
director decrease are combined as need be. 
  In regards to the Sirjan transmitters, it should be said 
that 
a detailed report was presented by the officials of the 
organization during the visit of the deputies, to which the 
deputies expressed their satisfaction in the location of the 
transmitter station. However, in the report, the contrary is 
stated. 
  In regards to the leaning of the Satellite Building which 
resulted in its destruction and the moving of the satellite 
equipment, it must be said: 
  Based on the report of qualified technical experts, the 
damage to this building was due to an earthquake with a vertical 
strike and if at any time this or similar earthquakes occur 
anywhere, it will have similar financial and human casualties. 
Hence, it is not clear why the group blames the officials of the 
Voice and Vision even in natural disasters. Of course, under 
this pretext, the Inquiry and Investigation Group has made 
unjust accusations against the educational deputy director of 
the organization, who at that time was the deputy carrying out 
the developmental projects of the Voice and Vision organization. 
With this logic, no doubt the managers of the Voice and Vision 
in Gilan and Zarjan are blamed for the earthquake in those 
provinces. 
  Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group makes false 
statements under the heading of the security of the 
organization, to which due to the importance of some of the 
instances, we shall respond. The Inquiry and Investigation Group 
claims that the existence of a strong security that can control 
the actions and behavior of the managers and personnel of this 
organization is obvious. Among the reports that from various 
sources reached the Investigation Committee concerning the 
managers, directors, and producers of mainly the Vision, about 
40 of them involved people who are serving in sensitive key 
positions. The committee prepared a report on their activities 
and in meetings that were held initially with the Administrative 
Violations Committee of the organization, the above-mentioned 
committee stated that they verify the statements that concern 
the violations and incompetence of the individuals on the 
above-mentioned list. 
  We know of no case of a sister having first entered the 
organization and later, as a result to the pressure and the 
climate of the organization, changed to another kind of veil. It 
is appropriate, if there is such an instance, that it be 
reported it to this organization. 
  Voice and Vision response: The statements of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group are untrue, because first the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group has had an unofficial meeting with two 
members of the Violations Committee. Second, initially, they had 
mentioned the names of two persons who were dismissed but by the 
order of the director of the organization were returned to work. 
When the files of these two people were placed at their 
disposal, it became known that one case was not returned and the 
second case was dismissed by the purging committee and returned 
to the organization in 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983]. It 
was on the order of one of the elements of interest to the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group and hence, fortunately, all the 
discussions in that meeting were recorded. The secretary of the 
group has the tape and can place it at the disposal of the Voice 
and Vision for broadcast. The Inquiry and Investigation Group 
has paid no attention and passed it by. In continuation, the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group says that in a meeting that they 
had with the general director of security of the organization, 
he has verified the reports concerning 40 people and later he 
has not cooperated. This is also untrue. First, the question of 
the Inquiry and Investigation Group in this connection was with 
financial misuse and moral corruption. But since there had been 
no cases, the director of security had said: I cannot make up 
evidence based on your wishes. The members of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Committee became very angry, threw the security 
file which was at their disposal into some corner and left the 
room. 
  In the continuation of this discussion, the group states 
other matters about which, because they are pure lies or due to 
the consideration for the interests of the country, we cannot 
comment. 
  Then the group, under the heading of the climate of the 
Voice 
and Vision, makes statements that are all untrue. Fortunately, 
almost all the officials of the regime have seen the work space 
environment of the Voice and Vision, and there is no need to 
explain the untruth in the report of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group. 
  In one case the group points out that the picture of a 
semi-naked foreign female tennis player was hanging on the wall 
of the office hall. Interestingly, the picture was a 25x20 color 
picture of a male tennis player, and it was not on the wall of 
the office hall but in the corridor of the technical warehouse. 
It was not a female tennis player, but a male tennis player. The 
Inquiry and Investigation Group says: "Because the secretaries 
of the organization from the high-ranking to the lower managers 
are all women employees, given the relations that these 
secretaries have with each other, they influence the decisions 
of the managers of the organization." 
  Voice and Vision response: First, because the members of the 
group apparently have "eyes for women," they have not seen the 
male secretaries, or, as it was stated, they saw a male tennis 
player as a female tennis player. 
  Second, if the decisions of the managers of an organization 
are to be influenced by the relationship of many of the 
secretaries of that organization, would this have happened if 
all the secretaries of the organization were men? 
  Such judgments that on the one hand, "stem from the 
male-dominated viewpoint of the members of the group" and on the 
other hand are very inexpert and superficial cannot be accepted 
by anyone who knows the first thing about the management of a 
sensitive organization such as the Voice and Vision. 
  Why they have looked at the issues so superficially is 
unclear to us. Or if it is, we will avoid explaining it further. 
  The group says: The official veiling in the Voice and Vision 
is a scarf and manteau and there are a very small number who 
cannot be seen in the organization who use the chador, and 
unfortunately most of the sisters who had initially gone to the 
organization with chadors have been forced to use a manteau and 
scarf as a result of the environment of the organization. 
  Voice and Vision response: First, those who have come to the 
organization when employees leave or arrive have seen a 
significant number of women in chadors, which itself is a strong 
proof of the falsity of the group's claim. 
  Second, in a number of jobs in this organization, the use of 
a chador is not possible, and hence in the work environment such 
sisters use very concealing manteaus and facial veils. 
  Third, we know of no instance of a sister having entered the 
organization with a chador and later changing to another veil 
due to the environmental pressure of the organization. It is 
appropriate, if this is the case, for it to be reported to the 
organization. 
  Fourth, as has been mentioned earlier, in Islam, what is 
obligatory for women is full covering and not the form of the 
covering. 
  The Inquiry and Investigation Group in the continuation of 
the same report says: "As a result of various pressures, which 
have been imposed on the organization, they allowed a sister to 
read the news in full Islamic veil (chador). After the second 
session, she was attacked in the corridors of the organization 
by a number of female employees. This claim of a group is a pure 
lie, both in regards to outside pressure and also the attack by 
the employees on the above-mentioned sister. 
  In regards to the organization, the group has made incorrect 
statements to which the Basij resistance headquarters has 
responded and apparently published in the newspaper. So no 
further explanation is necessary here. 
  Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group engaged in 
reporting 
its examination of the college. In the first part of the report, 
they have spoken of the shortages and inappropriateness of the 
educational environment of the college and the equipment and 
accused the officials of the organization over the past 15 years 
of having taken no steps to create the college. 
  Voice and Vision response: At least in the last 10 years, 
every year the estimated budget request for the building of the 
college has been made by the officials of the Voice and Vision. 
This request has either been omitted by the government or the 
Majles, and it is apparent that without a budget, it is not 
possible to build and equip a college. 
  Then the Inquiry and Investigation Group continues: "Since 
the college is under the direct supervision and policymaking of 
the educational deputy director, it is necessary to see who is 
the highest decisionmaking authority and who determines the 
directives for the training of the most important cultural and 
artistic strategies of the country. 
  Voice and Vision response: First, not only is the 
educational 
deputy director not a policymaker but no deputy director, 
neither in the Voice and Vision nor any other organization, is. 
He is the implementor of the policies. 
  Second, in the higher education units, including the Voice 
and Vision College, all the courses are approved and endorsed by 
the Supreme Educational Council of the Ministry of Culture and 
Higher Education and is not related to any other authority. 
  Third, in the Voice and Vision College, the head of the 
college is the implementor and supervisor of the implementation 
of the educational and training policies, not the educational 
deputy director. Under this pretext, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group has engaged in making empty accusations 
against him. For example, it has said that he was in charge of 
construction of the Satellite Building, which could have been 
one of the bloodiest accidents. 
  We have already explained about the satellite unit, that 
first he was not in charge of the construction of the building, 
but at the time he was executive deputy of the developmental 
projects of the organization, and one of the projects of the 
organization was the satellite project. 
  Second, the damage to the Satellite Building was due to the 
earthquake, and if there is anyone who is guilty, it was not he. 
  The group then continues that he was in charge of the 
construction of the Zibakenar villas where women and men swam 
together and drank alcohol. Again, first, the accusations that 
they say have occurred in the educational complex while serving 
in Zibakenar are lies, and even if an instance were to have 
happened, what does it have to do with the implementor of the 
project? And Second, he was not the implementor of the project, 
someone else was. 
  Then they say, this complex is not educational but 
recreational, and they have just called it educational. 
  The number of people who have been trained in this complex 
since it was opened, not only from the Voice and Vision 
employees but employees of other executive organizations, is 
very large. In the past few days a number of organizations which 
have had their training courses in this complex have asked us 
why the Inquiry and Investigation Group makes such false 
statements. They ask: Are they not deputies of the people in the 
Majles and have they not taken oaths to be their trustees? We 
have had and have no answer to the question of these people. 
  The group then continues: "His harsh and offensive reaction 
towards Hezbollah sisters and brothers of the organization is 
known to everyone. His de-Islamization exceeds his domain of 
authority and we witness the dismissal of religious persons..." 
  Unfortunately, there are no reasons or evidence of instances 
of accusations and the group has not presented any documents. We 
do not know on the basis of which standards have they allowed 
themselves to make such unjust and untrue accusations against 
the people. Are these not judicial crimes? If they do not prove 
it in the court, as they cannot, what is the punishment for such 
accusations which they have widely published? Will they be 
punished? 
  In any case, what will they answer to God? 
  The group then continues that he goes under various pretexts 
on trips and is especially interested in Japan. 
  First, the travel of all the managers, including him, is 
done 
when it is necessary. 
  Second, what kind of accusation is this to say that he is 
interested in Japan? And how have they discovered such an 
interest? 
  The group then says that in the ski competitions several 
years ago in Japan, the physical education officials had asked 
the hosts to have the flag of the Islamic Republic be carried by 
a man and upon his arrival he insisted that like other countries 
a woman must carry it, but the host officials did not accept it 
because there was not enough time for training. 
  Voice and Vision response: First, the flags of the countries 
are carried by the athletes of the same country and the flag of 
the Islamic Republic was also carried by an athlete member of 
the revolutionary institutions. 
  What was told to the group was probably about carrying the 
placard with the name of the countries, which is carried by a 
host, and what occurred was precisely the opposite. 
  Continuing this report, the Inquiry and Investigation Group, 
while insulting a number of professors and claiming not to 
choose them, states "the educational deputy in a letter asks the 
director of the organization to eliminate selection from 
entering students which is agreed to by the director of the 
organization and protested by the Supreme Council for Selection." 
  Voice and Vision response: These instances are also untrue, 
because in his correspondence he requested selection to respond 
within a certain period (three months), whether the applicants 
are admitted or not, and it was agreed to by the director of the 
organization. And the reason was that the situation of those 
admitted must be clarified for registration. 
  The group in the continuation makes unjust accusations 
against one of the most modest professors who wears a chador, 
which we are embarrassed to repeat here. 
  The statements of the group in this case, too, are pure 
lies, 
and we do not know why this group that in one place defends 
women with chadors makes unjust accusations here against one of 
the most modest of women in the organization. We do not know how 
they want to answer before justice for such contradictions and 
accusations. 
  God willing, God will protect us from the cursed Satan, 
Amen, 
oh Lord of Two Worlds. 
  In the conclusion of the report, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group quotes the students of the college 
concerning the low amount of student and welfare resources. 
  Voice and Vision response: We admit that there are 
insufficient resources for the students, but the students of the 
Voice and Vision College are no worse off in terms of welfare 
and educational aid than those in other universities and higher 
education centers. 
  We hope that with the increase in resources we will be able 
to provide the students with more resources, God willing. 
<H5>  A Few Points </H5>
  By expressing its disappointment in the content of the 
inquiry and investigation report, which is full of accusations 
and slander, the Voice and Vision organization did not have any 
choice but to respond, because in this connection it may cause 
anxiety for the public and lack of trust and confidence in the 
regime and this public university that is the powerful protector 
of the revolution and Islam. 
  Unfortunately, the inquiry and investigation report was 
broadcast from the Voice of the Islamic Republic on the 
threshold of the national and epic day of 13 Aban [4 November], 
the day of the struggle against the oppressors headed by the 
United States and was followed by many reactions from the 
people, officials, and experts. The above-mentioned reaction was 
the main reason for the organization's response. 
  Today, it has become certain for the self-sacrificing 
managers and the concerned employees of the organization that 
the inquiry and investigation report was prepared and devised on 
the basis of a particular premeditated political agenda and by a 
small number of the honorable deputies and does not represent 
the opinion and intention of all the honorable deputies of the 
Majles. And in spite of our previous wishes we have been obliged 
to refer to the past history of some of those who elected the 
valuable deputies to be aware of this difference. Hence, the 
response of the organization to the accusations was merely and 
directly to the claims of that small number of deputies, and 
legally, too, it had to be broadcast from the Voice of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Also, in this connection, the rights of the concerned and 
sincere employees and self-sacrificing and religious managers of 
the organization had to be defended, the Basij employees and 
managers who in these years of destiny, under the shower of 
missiles and in the middle of fields of problems, due to the 
enmity of the oppressors and other critical crises, have worked 
hard and fought day and night in various units of the 
organization to protect the values and foundations of the 
Islamic regime and for the people to be able to live with 
confidence in the regime and trust in the officials peacefully. 
  The other reason was that in order to enlighten the public 
mind and eliminate the doubts resulting from the untrue content 
of the inquiry and investigation report that had caused anger 
and anxiety for the people, the publication of the explanations 
and responses of the organization and announcing the related 
truth and facts seemed necessary, because one of the main 
principles of the work of the organization has always been based 
on creating a psychological balance and peace of mind in the 
society, and it is religiously and legally responsible to 
prevent the broadcast of matters that cause conflict in the 
society and disrupt public unity and respond appropriately to 
untrue statements and domestic and foreign problems and various 
ambiguities that disrupt national unity and the psychological 
and spiritual peace of the people in order to attain the last 
will and testament of the Imam and the emphatic recommendation 
of the grand leader in preserving unity in the society. Hence, 
the response of the organization to the accusations of the 
Inquiry and Investigation Committee was for the purpose of 
enlightening the public and preventing rumors and conflicts, 
which are the side effects for the people. 
  The response of the organization was also necessary from a 
different dimension. The accusations were so cowardly and 
climate creating that they discouraged the self-sacrificing and 
committed artists and writers and the religious and competent 
forces of the culture and caused instability and lack of job 
security for those who have worked hard, truthfully, and 
sincerely for years and this seemed very unpleasant and hard. If 
they were not supported and defended on time, it would pose 
questions to their future service to the revolution and Islamic 
art and culture, which would have been irreparable. 
  One of the most important reasons for the response of the 
organization is the heartfelt and religious duty and commitment 
that we felt in defending the ideas of the founder of the 
Islamic revolution and the grand leader. The late Imam 
identified the Voice and Vision as the public university and 
Ayatollah Khamene'i the protector of the revolution and Islam. 
Silence with regard to the content of the untrue inquiry and 
investigation report would be considered treason against the 
revolution and its leaders, because the cultural policies and 
the basic goals, principles, priorities and the fundamental 
policies of the organization have been completed by the grand 
leader and always implemented. Concerning the cultural 
principles and the culture-creating events and also cultural 
pestilence, the Imam said: 
  "Culture is the source of all fortunes and misfortunes of a 
nation. Leaving the misleading Western culture and replacing it 
with the instructive Islamic and national culture and cultural 
revolution in all areas throughout the country requires such 
work and effort that years must be spent to achieve it. `And the 
danger of those with stone-age mentality and stupid 
pseudo-religious individuals...is not small.' In the Islamic 
Republic, except in cases when Islam and the dignity of the 
regime is threatened and as determined by a wise expert, no one 
can impose his opinion on another.... If we are able to 
present a regime based on the true following of the slogan, 
"Neither Eastern nor Western" and an Islam devoid of hypocrisy 
and deception, then the revolution would be victorious." 
  "The way to reform a country is through the culture of that 
country. Reform must start with the culture. We hope mankind 
will reach such growth that will change the machine guns into 
pens. As much as the pen and expression have served mankind, 
machine guns have not.... The basis is to defend the truth and 
replace the machine gun with truth and science. Propaganda, 
which is the same as identifying the good and encouraging people 
to do them and show evil and the way to escape and prohibit it, 
is a very important principle of dear Islam. Show the framework 
of pure Mohammadan Islam, which is in drawing sacred and 
revolutionary anger, wrath, and hostility against Western 
capitalism and the aggressive communism of the East and also the 
path to fight hypocrisy and deception to the people, especially 
the brave young people. This issue, that the regime is serious 
in its goals and if the Islamic values are threatened it will 
deal decisively with anyone in any situation, must be propagated 
as an unchanging principle for all officials and the people." 
  The above directives that are the fundamental principles and 
cultural policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran acquaint 
sincere, God seeking, and concerned individuals with many truths 
and warns them of the dangers and the intellectual and cultural 
ideas contrary to the pure and happiness-creating Islamic 
culture. 
  The warnings of his honor concerning those with stone-age 
mentality and pseudo-religious individuals must always be kept 
in mind, and we must take seriously the danger of stone-age 
mentality, superficiality, hypocrisy, and deception. 
  But, unfortunately, clear and perfect traces of stone-age 
mentality and superficiality can be seen in the inquiry and 
investigation report, which seems, when it is placed alongside 
other recent events, to assume a particularly dangerous meaning 
and will have improper and inappropriate consequences. This 
sense of threat can be strongly seen in the reactions of the 
people--the people who are always present on the scene--to the 
inquiry and investigation report. 
<H5>  A Few Words With the People </H5>
  We thank you for your telephone calls and support. Let us 
discuss a few points with you. 
  First, you know well that every once in a while attacks are 
launched by those with a stone-age mentality, superficial 
thinkers, or those from particular political leanings against 
the programs and cultural activities of the Voice and Vision 
organization. If we evaluate them optimistically, we realize 
that these attacks have been formed due to the lack of awareness 
on the part of their operators of the ratified principles, 
policies, and goals of the organization and unfamiliarity with 
the kind and expansion of the work of this powerful medium and 
for this reason will soon lose their color. Hence, you can be 
certain, and there is no room for worry, that the programs of 
the organization will be as strong as before and will be 
designed, produced, and broadcast as the most healthy, most 
moral, and most instructive means to fill your hours of leisure, 
for strengthening your spiritual and psychological peace of mind 
and on the basis of Islamic values and your various needs. 
  Second, the organization has always tried to avoid 
responding 
to accusations and to not be a slave to the common traps, chaos 
and psychological attacks that intend to engage the managers and 
officials and subsequently decrease the production and technical 
activities, and still, as in the past, it does not intend to 
respond to any minor accusation or lie published by incompetent 
people or personal tastes in the press. In the future, too, it 
will try not to respond to such cases and follow the directive 
of the Koran, which states: And the servants of (God), most 
gracious, are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when 
the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace...." 
  Those who witness no falsehood, and if they pass by 
futility, 
they pass by it with honorable avoidance. 
  But since the report of the Inquiry and Investigation 
Committee has been issued by an official authority and widely 
spread, with cowardly accusations against the self-sacrificing 
managers and Hezbollah, committed, and active employees, it was 
obvious and caused anger, anxiety, and doubt in the society, we 
were obliged to respond, although we did not wish to do so. 
  Third, in exchange for your encouragement and for your peace 
of mind, we have some good news for the noble and good people of 
Iran, especially the majority, who have no video players: The 
efforts of the active colleagues in the Voice and Vision in 
planning and operation of the technical system of Network 3 has 
reached fruition, and in the near future good and appropriate 
programs will be broadcast for your leisure time. 
<H5>  A Few Words With the Press </H5>
  The independent press underwent the test of freedom and 
adherence to the law of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Islamic 
morality, and duty well, may God grant them more success. But a 
dependent newspaper failed the test and was humiliated. This 
group published the inquiry and investigation report, which 
contained many accusations, such as drinking alcohol, illicit 
relations, theft, spying for foreigners, de-Islamization, etc., 
concerning the serving people in the organization and not only 
refused to publish the legitimate defense and the response of 
the Voice and Vision organization, but wrote in defense and 
praise of the main elements who prepared the inquiry and 
investigation report and the fabrications of the accusations. 
Whereas Islamic duty and the legal framework of the press and 
religious ethics dictated that they publish the response to the 
accusations to prevent damage to the dignity of the servants and 
to eliminate doubt. Indeed, "why did they not do so" is an 
important question. Perhaps the officials of this newspaper did 
not consider the above-mentioned accusations of drinking wine, 
illicit relations, theft, de-Islamization, etc., to be 
violations and regard them as good deeds and hence they did not 
consider them accusations and refused to publish them. 
  Or perhaps they did not consider it in the financial 
interest 
of their newspaper and violated political ethics, the honor of 
journalism, and the law of the press. If only this group of the 
dependent newspaper would for once publish for the people their 
ideological line, group goals, and work ethic in order for the 
people to become more familiar with their implemental goals. 
Even in the heathen ideology of Marxism you cannot find such a 
justification for publishing a letter of insult against a number 
of active, hard-working, committed people not to respond and 
defend those who have been unjustly accused. 
  In any case, we say to the grand families of the martyrs, 
self-sacrificers, and missing-in-action, especially the revered 
families of the martyrs, self-sacrificers and missing-in-action 
of the Voice and Vision organization, while praising their 
self-sacrifice, that we have pledged to God to continue your 
path on the culture front and not be afraid of any harm. 
  If your dear ones and children fought on the battle fronts 
against oppression and generously gave their blood and life to 
help and strengthen the sapling of the Islamic revolution and 
preserve the values, we too have made a pledge to fight bravely 
in the cultural front and put up resistance. We have been 
completely sincere and are ready to sacrifice our life and 
reputation to strengthen the fruitful tree of the Islamic 
revolution. 
  Oh God, grant us success in achieving the goals of the 
Islamic revolution and the directives of Imam Khomeyni and the 
grand leader. 
  Oh God, grant us success in serving more and step more 
steadfastly in the path of Your guidance. 
  Oh God, increase our revolutionary resistance and patience 
in 
acting on the lofty instructions and carrying out our religious 
duties. Amen.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Following the publication of the statement by the 
Majles public relations office which was about the radio 
broadcast of the response by the Voice and Vision organization, 
protesting the report by the Majles Inquiry and Investigation 
Group, the Voice and Vision organization's public relations 
office sent a reply, which appears below: 
  The Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran thanks the Majles public relations office for opening the 
discussion on the rights and prerogatives of government bodies 
and organizations. This made some important points known to the 
respected law and policy makers in the three powers, as well as 
to the ever-present-on-the-scene and martyr-nurturing people of 
Islamic Iran. 
  1. While the Voice and Vision organization believes in 
Article 76 of the Constitution, which has given the 
responsibility for research and investigation to the respected 
Majles, it believes that this article guarantees the 
continuation of the government and the perpetuation of Islamic 
values. However, the aforementioned organization feels obligated 
to answer the affronts to honor, which were in a report from the 
Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group in the form of very ugly 
and inappropriate accusations against the organization's 
hard-working and hezbollah management and its concerned, active, 
and committed workers. 
  2. Article 171 of the Constitution gives people who have 
been 
subjected to accusations the right to defend themselves and it 
makes it obligatory to restore their spiritual and material 
honor and dignity. 
  In this regard it is necessary to look at Article 39 of the 
Constitution. 
  Article 39: "Affronts to the honor and dignity of someone 
who 
has been arrested, detained, imprisoned, or exiled by legal 
order in any form are forbidden and subject to punishment." 
  The aforementioned law forbids affronts to the honor of 
criminals and exiles and considers this subject to punishment. 
It is clear that affronting the collective and individual honor 
of those running a government body in any form or pretext is a 
violation of the Constitution and the criteria of religious law. 
  3. The Voice and Vision organization, according to Article 6 
of the Law on General Policies and Principles of the Voice and 
Vision organization's Programming enacted on Thursday 17 Tir 
1361 [8 July 1982] by the respected Majles, is required to 
prevent and avoid affronting the honor of individuals. We quote 
the text of Article 6: 
  Article 6: "Respect the human dignity of individuals and 
refrain from affronting their honor, in accordance with Islamic 
regulations." 
  Shouldn't the Voice and Vision organization do its lawful 
duty in respecting the human dignity of individuals? Moreover, 
to preserve Islamic, social and security values, the 
organization is required to act in accordance with Article 19 of 
the policies law. Article 19 clearly specifies the items whose 
publication the organization must prevent, and while mentioning 
their study, we will quote the two relevant paragraphs: 
  Paragraph B, Article 19: "Accusing the nation's official 
bodies and organizations and groups, societies and parties whose 
activities are lawful according to the Political Parties Law." 
  The aforementioned law includes the Voice and Vision 
organization, which is one of the government's most sensitive 
organizations and has the confidence and trust of the leader and 
the people. Therefore, the Voice and Vision organization is 
legally required to prevent the broadcast of accusations and 
incorrect material from the Inquiry and Investigation Commission 
during the direct broadcast over the Voice and Vision of the 
Islamic Republic. 
  Likewise, in view of Paragraph H, Article 19, due to the 
fact 
that the names of the leaders of a counterrevolutionary 
minigroup were given in the commission's report and caused the 
false idea to be created for some people that the aforementioned 
opponents of the government might acquire power, the 
organization is required by law to stop the direct broadcast and 
to broadcast the report at an appropriate time for public 
information after deleting the accusations, affronts to honor, 
and propaganda for minigroups. 
  Unfortunately, however, since the inquiry and investigation 
report was broadcast directly, the possibility was taken away 
from us for monitoring it, observing the law and carrying out 
our responsibilities. 
  4. Now that the report from the Inquiry and Investigation 
Group has been broadcast verbatim with all the inappropriate 
accusations and affronts to the honor of individuals, outside 
the lawful responsibility of the Voice and Vision organization, 
it appears that one must turn to the Constitution and read all 
of Article 69, which is the result of long discussions by 
theologians and legal specialists, was approved by the Assembly 
of Experts and was given final approval by His Holiness the 
Imam, and apply it. Here it is necessary to study the provisions 
of the Constitution to clarify the responsibilities of the Voice 
and Vision organization, and we must study the limits and 
boundaries in broadcasting the proceedings of the respected 
Majles. 
  In Article 69 of the Constitution, we read: "Majles 
proceedings must be public and a complete report of them must be 
published via official radio and newspapers for public 
information...." 
  First: In Article 69 of the Constitution mention is made 
only 
of the proceedings of the respected Majles deputies and there is 
no mention of the pre-agenda speeches and the special reports 
such as the inquiry and investigation report. These kinds of 
events are beyond the absolute and lawful meaning of the term 
"proceedings," and the radio is not legally required to 
broadcast these items. 
  Second: There is no kind of direct or indirect mention of 
the 
live and direct broadcast of sessions or even the proceedings of 
the respected Majles. 
  Third: The law clearly states that a "report" of the 
proceedings must be broadcast by radio for public information, 
not the proceedings themselves. If the law had intended the 
broadcast of the actual proceedings and sessions it would not 
have used the term "report" and it would have written instead, 
for example: The "verbatim proceedings" must be broadcast 
without alteration for public information. 
  The term "report" applies in its meaning and lawful intent 
to 
the presence of a third person between the originator of the 
message and the intended receiver of the message. 
  Fourth: The spirit and intent of the Constitution will be 
better understood when we read Article 69 along with Articles 40 
and 22 as well as with paragraphs B, D, and H of Article 19 of 
the Law on the General Policies and Principles of the Voice and 
Vision organization's Programming approved by the Majles, and 
when we study all the laws as a whole. In this way it is 
understood that the Constitution makes no kind of reference or 
even allusion to the direct broadcast of the sessions of the 
respected Majles, and that its emphasis and explanations are 
about reporting on them. 
  Therefore, while we thank again the Majles public relations 
office for opening the discussion on limitations and boundaries, 
the Voice and Vision organization intends to submit a request 
for a conceptual study of Article 69 to the competent 
authorities so that the Constitution can be implemented in this 
regard and anything resembling heresy will be eliminated. 
Because of its belief and complete faith in the Constitution and 
its experience in these 12 years witnessing events, problems and 
critical dangers in direct broadcasts, and in view of the 
message from His Holiness the Imam (may his grave be 
sanctified), as the second [as published] term of the Majles 
begins, the management of the Voice and Vision organization 
intends to pursue seriously the important matter of a conceptual 
study of Article 69 in order to observe Islamic ethics, avoid 
insults and also to follow recent guidance in this regard from 
the exalted leader. Again, it expresses its thanks to the 
respected Majles public relations office. 
  5. In its statement the Majles public relations office has 
accused the Voice and Vision organization of heresy. This new 
point must also be studied carefully. 
  First: Based on Article 69 of the Constitution and the legal 
explanations, which have been presented concerning it, it is 
this Inquiry and Investigation Group, which has committed heresy 
and has made the illegal matter of directly broadcasting its 
report lawful and assumed it to be within the domain of its 
prerogatives, thereby making an illicit innovation. 
  Second: Reporting on research and investigation is itself 
another heresy that could be dangerous for the nation's future 
and could disrupt national unity and harmony. 
  In the Constitution the matter of research and investigation 
is considered lawful, and affronting honor, making accusations 
and publishing lies is prohibited and subject to penalties. 
Therefore, employing illegal material such as accusations, 
slander, and insults in the name of lawful research and 
investigation is itself a new heresy that the aforementioned 
group has committed, and not the Voice and Vision organization. 
  Third: Under the law of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
other regulations approved by the respected Majles, any person 
has the right to defend himself against accusations in the same 
media. How is it that the Voice and Vision organization must 
broadcast the answers submitted by all the offices to the 
criticism and protests broadcast by the people, but it does not 
have the right to answer the incorrect statements and unworthy 
accusations concerning its own performance and its workers? If 
it answers, is this heresy and making personal use of public 
facilities? Based on this, it appears that the accusations in 
the inquiry and investigation report, in view of Articles 39 and 
40 of the Constitution, are heresy. The answer from the Voice 
and Vision organization on the one hand is the lawful right of 
every person and legal entity as an answer to insults and 
accusations against itself, and on the other hand the 
organization has acted on its lawful duty to fight heresy and 
the groundwork for heresy. 
  6. The Law on General Policies and Principles of the Voice 
and Vision organization's programming requires the organization 
to fight heresy. Article 26 of the policy law reads as follows: 
  Article 26: Informing public opinion concerning ideological 
heresy and deviation as mentioned in the Tradition "if deviation 
arises..." [unattributed Arabic quote] 
  After the reading of the inquiry and investigation report, 
the Voice and Vision organization was faced with two important 
heresies. 
  The first heresy was the heresy of making accusations and 
insults in the sacred name of the lawful duty of inquiry and 
investigation. The second heresy, which is the largest and most 
painful heresy possible, is the Inquiry and Investigation Group 
open and direct opposition to the written views, emphatic 
statements and guidance from His Holiness the Imam (may his 
grave be sanctified), and this is intolerable for the managers 
of the organization. Silence was seen to be the equivalent of 
treason. 
  The respected members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group 
were aware of all the Imam's theological guidance and views, and 
today after the instances of their opposition to His Holiness 
the Imam's views are made clear, they cannot exonerate 
themselves on the pretext that they were not aware of them. At 
the first meeting between the respected members of the group and 
the chief of the organization, the chief of the Voice and Vision 
organization explained His Holiness the Imam's theological views 
and opinions to them. Moreover, at that same meeting the chief 
of the organization explained: "According to Article 107 of the 
Constitution, in addition to the fact that His Holiness the Imam 
is the owner of the revolution and the founder of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, he is recognized and accepted as source of 
emulation and leader by a decisive majority of the population. 
Therefore in all matters of religious law such as the veil, 
music, makeup, and the matter at hand, the Voice and Vision 
organization has acted in accordance with his theological views. 
If the Inquiry and Investigation Group wants to study the 
performance of the organization, it must study and evaluate 
based on His Holiness the Imam's criteria and standards and not 
those of some other authority. Likewise, even if there is a 
member of the Inquiry and Investigation Group who has written a 
treatise or a fatwa, he cannot use his own view and fatwa." 
  In order to be sure that the group would be able to evaluate 
based on the views and fatwas of the Imam, the organization sent 
the theological views and guidance from his excellency in a 
letter to the chief of the Inquiry and Investigation Group. 
Therefore if the members of the group declare today that they 
were not aware of His Holiness the Imam's theological views, 
criteria, and standards, it is not acceptable or forgivable. 
  7. Unfortunately under these conditions the Voice and Vision 
organization cannot defend His Holiness the Imam's (may his 
grave be sanctified) theological views and criteria any more 
than this, because it is possible that the Voice and Vision 
organization will be accused of defending its own performance 
and then the aforementioned views and criteria may be 
questioned. However, it does not appear that the deputies and 
officials who follow the Imam will remain silent in the fact of 
such rudeness. Therefore the Voice and Vision organization is 
lawfully and religiously required to inform the public about the 
aforementioned heresy, which is definitely considered a 
deviation from theological fundamentals, and it was not the 
first nor will it be the last instance. 
  8. In addition to the aforementioned legal proofs, the 
broadcast of the answer from the Voice and Vision organization 
to the inquiry and investigation report was based on a measure 
enacted 8/3/1363 [25 October 1984] by the Voice and Vision 
organization Supervisory Council, and this measure, because of 
the presence of representatives of the three branches of law, 
has the validity of law. It is appropriate to ask the Majles 
public relations office, is applying the law heresy? Or is the 
law for the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Commission 
different than the law for the Voice and Vision organization? It 
would also have been appropriate if the statement from the 
Majles public relations office had been written with more study, 
care, and examination of the record, because the Voice and 
Vision organization has implemented the measure enacted on 
8/3/1363 by the Supervisory Council during the second, third, 
and fourth terms of the Majles. 
  Moreover, supposing a law is not implemented for 20 years. 
Does it cease to be a law in the eyes of the respected Majles 
public relations office, and is it illegal to implement it? 
  In this connection we note that according to Paragraph B, 
Article 8 of the Voice and Vision organization administration 
law, which is devoted to the duties of the executive director, 
the executive director is required to observe the measures 
enacted by the Supervisory Council. 
  9. Since the undocumented and unproven accusations from the 
Inquiry and Investigation Commission were directed at 
individuals and lawful entities in the organization and in 
several cases at all the organization's workers, many complaints 
have been sent to the offices of the organization's managers and 
its legal unit, and the organization's management cannot prevent 
them from being sent to the legal authorities. 
  In conclusion, we ask the respected judiciary, which has 
properly announced that it will investigate the complaints from 
the respected deputies, will it also investigate the complaints 
from the workers and managers of the Voice and Vision 
organization who were insulted, accused, and had their honor 
affronted, or not? Will it investigate the violation of the 
prerogatives of Article 39 of the Constitution, which caused all 
this heresy and these unworthy accusations, insults and slander 
without proof or documentation, or not?

  [Text] News Service: The Islamic Culture, Guidance 
and Art Committee of the Majles issued a communique in response 
to the hasty response of the Voice and Vision. The text of the 
communique is as follows: 
  Brave and alert people of Iran; 
  The Islamic Culture, Guidance and Art Committee, with 
consideration for the hasty, irrational, and unfair response of 
the Voice and Vision to the inquiry and investigation report of 
the Majles concerning the Voice and Vision, considers mention of 
the following as necessary. 
  1) After the sacred institution of the leadership of the 
regime of the Islamic Republic, the Majles holds the highest 
position. The specific interpretations of the late Imam and the 
grand leader in expressing the high position of the Majles is 
not unknown to anyone. To insult the sacred Majles is to insult 
the revered people of Iran and is an unforgivable sin. 
  2) The Majles is the most important supervisory organization 
of the country, and this supervision takes the form of 
reminders, questions and inquiry and investigation. Article 76 
of the Constitution gives explicit right of inquiry and 
investigation in all affairs of the country to the Majles, and 
to ignore or discredit it is a clear contradiction of the 
explicit text of the Constitution. 
  3) The Inquiry and Investigation Committee was formed of 
committed, concerned, active, and scrutinizing brothers who in 
carrying out the duty conferred on them spent a great deal of 
time in regular meetings and numerous visits and carried out 
this task with utmost care and impartiality, for which the 
Islamic Culture, Art and Guidance Committee must express its 
appreciation. 
  4) The statements presented in the report of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Committee are based on documents and evidence 
obtained from the official sources in the country, including the 
Accounting Office and the Voice and Vision itself. 
  5) Since the Voice and Vision Organization is under the 
supervision of the grand leader, as soon as the issue of inquiry 
and investigation was raised in the Majles, it was presented to 
his honor and this task was carried out with his permission. 
  6) The original inquiry and investigation report is 500 
pages, and in order to be brief and considerate of the Majles' 
time, it was summarized in 63 pages. If necessary, the entire 
investigation report will be presented. 
  7) The response of the Voice and Vision contained nonfactual 
statements and many problems, with which, if necessary, we will 
deal. 
  8) Unfortunately, the Voice and Vision in its response 
questions the honorable members of the Inquiry and Investigation 
Committee, especially the revered professor, Mr. Parvaresh, 
whose commitment, history of struggle, and distinguished 
personality are as bright as the sun. This improper action has 
strongly disturbed the scholars, clerics, and various strata of 
the Hezbollah nation, especially the martyr-nurturing people of 
Esfahan. 
  9) As the honorable speaker of the Majles stated in his 
speech on 23/08/1372 [14 November 1993] in the Majles, it is 
necessary to express appreciation for the round-the-clock 
activities of the concerned, competent Hezbollah people in the 
Voice and Vision and explicitly announce that these dear ones 
are by no means addressed by the Inquiry and Investigation 
Committee, but the purpose was to show the faces that 
essentially are in deep and open conflict with the regime, the 
leadership, and the Islamic revolution and who must be 
eliminated from the Voice and Vision in order to create the 
possibility for the growth and thriving of the committed, 
sincere, and concerned forces who believe in the path of the 
Imam and the grand leader of the revolution. 
  10) The broadcast of the next segments of the response of 
the 
Voice and Vision through this medium was stopped upon the 
instruction of the grand leader and this indicates very well his 
opinion with regard to the behavior of the Voice and Vision. 
  11) In conclusion, we sincerely thank the various strata of 
the Hezbollah nation who in various forms have expressed their 
support for this action by the Majles and have been kind to us 
and assure our dear nation that your servants in the sacred 
stronghold of the Majles will continue inquiry and investigation 
in all cases decisively and with precision and are certain that 
preserving and strengthening the supervisory dimension of the 
Majles will have a significant effect on reforming and improving 
the situation of the executive organizations of the country.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] News Service. The deputies of the people condemned 
the willful action taken by the Director of the Voice and Vision 
organization in answering the Majles Inquiry and Investigation 
Group on the Voice of the Islamic Republic and also his insults 
to the Majles. 
  Our correspondent reports that at yesterday's open Majles 
session Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the 
Majles, emphasized the special position of the Majles in the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He said: As a 
servant of the Majles, I consider it necessary to defend the 
status and position of the Majles, because if this position is 
not defended, in reality it will hurt the clear rights of the 
Majles, which, by order of His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon 
him), is the head of all affairs and is the central 
manifestation of the will of the nation. 
  He added: The Majles is the nation's law-making center. The 
constitutional experts created this honor, and Iran's Majles is 
the most powerful in the world in terms of its prerogatives. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri discussed the duty 
of 
the Majles. He said: One dimension of the Majles mission is 
making laws. Another dimension is supervision of the 
implementation of the laws it enacts. 
  He said: The Constitution has 40 articles on the importance, 
position, duties, and rank of the Majles. Based on one of these 
duties, which is inquiry and investigation, we are studying the 
performance of the Voice and Vision organization. 
  He added: Based on Article 79 of the Constitution, the 
Majles 
has the right to inquire and investigate all the nation's 
affairs, and based on Article 149 of its executive guidelines, 
whenever a deputy thinks it necessary, he can submit his request 
for inquiry and investigation in writing to the Majles Speaker's 
Council and the relevant commission, and the commission will 
make the necessary information available to that deputy or 
deputies, and it will invite the deputy or deputies to give the 
reasons at the earliest opportunity why it is necessary to do 
the inquiries and investigation. After study, the commission 
will report to the Majles on its approval or rejection of the 
deputy's request. This report will be given priority on the 
Majles agenda, and if approved in the Majles the inquiries and 
investigation will be done. 
  He added: The organization or unit, which is investigated, 
is 
required to provide all the necessary information to the Inquiry 
and Investigation Group. 
  Mr. Nateq-Nuri noted: Based on its lawful mission, the 
Majles 
has about 17 research and investigation projects of various 
organizations and bodies on its agenda, and after studies are 
completed a report on these will be made public. 
  He discussed the inquiry and investigation report on the 
performance of the Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. He said: This report was about 500 pages. We 
asked the gentlemen doing the research to reduce its size. It 
was reduced finally to 150 pages, and then to 100 pages. In 
places where the honor of individuals was concerned and where 
the honor of individuals was affronted, a pronoun was 
substituted except in cases where the names of individuals were 
used in a positive way. Of course the name of the chief of the 
organization was also used in one or two cases. 
  He said: When several of the deputies asked for an inquiry 
and investigation, the letter with this request came to me. 
Because the Voice and Vision organization is managed under the 
direct supervision of the vice-regent, I kept the letter until I 
could learn what to do from the vice-regent. When I presented 
the request for research and investigation to him, he said not 
only should the Voice and Vision organization be studied, but 
also that any other place that is necessary should also be 
carefully studied. He said you should even study individuals. 
Based on the exalted leader's instructions, the commission began 
its work with Majles approval. 
  The speaker of the Majles noted: Today the vice-regent of 
the 
Muslims is the exalted leader, and his vice-regency is that of 
the Prophet of God and God's vice-regent. We must make what we 
do conform to his wishes, and we must obey his excellency. The 
members of the Majles Guidance Commission are prominent people 
whose record of combat is concealed from no one. If we were to 
talk about who incited the people of Esfahan against the shah's 
regime, Mr. Parvaresh was one of the first ones to incite the 
people of Esfahan against the regime of the idolaters. After the 
triumph of the Islamic revolution he was also minister of 
education and training, and during the period of the sacred 
defense he was one of the decision makers on the Supreme Defense 
Council during the First Majles. 
  He said: Mr. Parvaresh has the confidence of the exalted 
leader and had the confidence of His Holiness the Imam (peace be 
upon him). What the Voice and Vision organization said about him 
was an insult to the Majles, an insult to the people of Esfahan 
and an affront to His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him). 
Dealing in this way with the Imam's name is an insult to what 
the Imam called holy, which in my view is a great affront. 
  The Majles speaker noted: As a servant of the Majles I 
consider it my duty to defend the Majles. The exalted leader 
said: It is incumbent upon everyone to preserve the honor of the 
Majles. Is this preserving the honor of the Majles? Is this 
following the exalted leader? 
  He said: When the first part of the answer from the Voice 
and 
Vision organization to the Majles inquiry and investigation 
report was broadcast, the exalted leader stopped its further 
broadcast. Wasn't stopping the broadcast of this answer a signal 
that this action did not please his excellency? 
  It is necessary for me to say to our dear nation that the 
exalted leader prevented the broadcast of the answer from the 
Voice and Vision organization. Despite this, isn't answering and 
insisting on one's position ignoring the response from the 
exalted leader? This is definitely a violation. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri noted: Appointing 
and 
dismissing the official in charge of the Voice and Vision 
organization is the prerogative of the leader of the revolution, 
and we will obey any decision he makes. I thank the pious and 
toiling personnel of the Voice and Vision organization. Everyone 
appreciates the efforts of the pious personnel in this 
organization. 
  With all its educational programming, the Voice of the 
Islamic Republic is not to be ignored. Its artists were even 
active before the Islamic revolution and after the triumph of 
the Islamic revolution they continued to make their art 
available to the government. I thank these people and everyone 
appreciates them. 
  He said: The Majles research and investigation of the 
performance of the Voice and Vision organization was done 
precisely to preserve the rights of the pious and toiling 
personnel in this organization. 
  The speaker of the Majles also discussed the exalted 
leader's 
remarks on 13 Aban [4 November] (National Antiworld Imperialism 
Day) and the position his excellency took against America. He 
said: Unfortunately the episode of the Voice and Vision 
organization's answer to the Majles inquiry and investigation 
report overshadowed the peerless remarks by the exalted leader 
on 13 Aban, which were the heart's desire of the Iranian nation, 
and little has been said about it. 
  He said: When the exalted leader takes a position against 
America and cries out, one feels that it is His Holiness the 
Imam (peace be upon him) roaring against America. 
  He added: Some people thought that the occupation of 
America's spy den was done blindly. The exalted leader mentions 
what happened before the revolution and says that the occupation 
of America's spy den was a reaction to America's crimes! 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri noted: Our 
contemporary generation remembers America's crimes. After the 
triumph of the Islamic revolution some of them remained in the 
American Embassy and continued with their plots. They made 
contact with the opponents of the revolution and encouraged 
agents from the former regime to sabotage the revolution and the 
nation. These actions by America caused the spy nest to be 
occupied. 
  He added: In his remarks the exalted leader says that some 
people look at the situation superficially, and that weak people 
with a superficial view should not be allowed to discuss the 
occupation of the spy den. Elsewhere he says: Revolutions have 
usually eliminated these weak ones. Powerful countries and 
nations have also usually eliminated these weak ones who have 
gained power illegitimately. 
  The Majles speaker noted: The exalted leader said that 
preserving relations with America is damaging to nations and 
countries. In nations where there have been revolutions and they 
did not cut their ties with America completely, the Americans 
deprived them of heart and even of their revolutionary leaders. 
First they frightened the nations and their revolutionary 
leaders, and then they removed them from public life. 
  In conclusion he said: I say to the exalted leader that it 
is 
an honor for the Majles to obey and follow you, and we never 
forget for a moment to follow your excellency and your 
positions. We vow to follow you on the path of battle with world 
imperialism, and death to America will always be our slogan. 
  The same report states that Hasan Aminlu, deputy from 
Shabestar and Dari Najafabadi and Mohammad Reza Bahonar, 
deputies from Tehran, gave pre-agenda speeches at today's Majles 
session in which they discussed the broadcast over the national 
Voice of the Islamic Republic of the answer from the Voice and 
Vision organization to the Majles inquiry and investigation 
report, and they condemned this. 
  In his pre-agenda speech, Mr. Hasan Aminlu, deputy from 
Shabestar, said: Unfortunately the management of the Voice and 
Vision organization, instead of giving its answer to the Majles, 
violated the law by creating public controversy and raising 
questions about the nation's trustees. I condemn this illegal 
act, which is an unworthy act of heresy, and I consider it the 
right of the Majles to do research and investigation for the 
health of the government and to preserve the values of the 
revolution. 
  In his pre-agenda speech, Najafabadi discussed the same 
issue. He said: Although the honor and position of the Majles is 
concealed from no one, instead of resolving to correct its 
weaknesses, the management of the Voice and Vision organization 
insulted and slandered the Majles, and it made accusations 
against committed and valuable people such as Mr. Parvaresh and 
Mr. Yahyavi and the Inquiry and Investigation Group. 
  He added: Insulting the Majles is an insult to whom? 
Wouldn't 
it have been better if he had come to his senses a little and 
dropped the blackmail, the threats and the controversial 
statements? 
  The same report states that Mr. Mohammad Reza Bahonar, 
deputy 
from Tehran, emphasized the fact that this action was a 
violation of the law. He praised and thanked the Friday imams 
throughout the country, especially the Friday imam of Qom, His 
Holiness Ayatollah Meshkini and the temporary Friday imam of 
Tehran, for their support of the Majles. 
  Mr. Bahonar said: The chief of the Voice and Vision 
organization does not have the right to use this organization's 
resources as his own resources. 
  He added: The Majles will use all its ability and power, 
which arises from the will of the nation and the wishes of the 
vice-regent, to do research and investigation in every area it 
deems advisable, and it will make the results available to the 
martyr-nurturing people. 
  In conclusion Mr. Bahonar said: Yesterday the supervisor of 
the Voice and Vision organization expressed doubt about the 
continued direct broadcast of the Majles proceedings over the 
Voice of the Islamic Republic. If the manager of the Voice and 
Vision organization is speaking as the policymaker of the Voice 
and Vision organization, this conflicts with the exalted 
leader's view. May God help everyone to know his power in 
whatever position he may occupy, and help him not to step out of 
his own domain. 
  He said: God willing, the government officials will deal 
carefully with this matter and conclude it so the issue will be 
eliminated.

  [Text] News Department. Following the reading of the Majles 
Inquiry and Investigation report on the performance of the Voice 
and Vision organization at the open Majles sessions Tuesday and 
Wednesday of last week, in an unprecedented move, the Voice and 
Vision organization broadcast the first part of an answer from 
the chief of this organization to the Majles at 1600 on Saturday 
8/15/1372 [6 November 1993] over the national network of the 
Voice of the Islamic Republic. 
  At the end the announcer said that the continuation of the 
answer would be read in subsequent programs on the Voice of the 
Islamic Republic, but as of the time of this report this has not 
been done. It is said that other parts of the answer were 
prepared by the chief of the Voice and Vision organization, but 
for unknown reasons they have not yet been broadcast. 
  In the text that was read on the Voice of the Islamic 
Republic, many insults were directed at the members of the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group and the Majles deputies. RESALAT 
did not publish it because of the insults and slander, and 
because of the press law.

  [Text] News Service. After the report from the Majles 
Inquiry and Investigation Group was read in the Majles on 11 and 
12 Aban [2 and 3 November] an answer was presented by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran Voice and Vision organization, which 
was broadcast fully, yesterday by the national radio network. 
Printed below is a summary of the answer from the Voice and 
Vision organization: 
  During the lifetime of the Imam (may Almighty God be pleased 
with him), his excellency gave special attention and favor to 
the Voice and Vision organization. Under the revised version of 
the Constitution it came under the supervision of the exalted 
leader. It has therefore always been the closest organization to 
the vice-regent and the leader. 
  This report adds: As the voice of the Islamic revolution, 
the 
Voice and Vision organization has numerous supporters and 
opponents. 
  Foremost among this media's supporters is His Holiness the 
Imam, may Almighty God be pleased with him, the exalted leader, 
the respected officials in the government, the hezbollah nation 
and the Muslims of the world. Foremost among the opponents of 
this media are the counterrevolutionary groups and groups who 
were damaged by the revolution such as the hypocrites, the 
leftist minigroups, the Hojjatieh Society, the supporters of 
America and Israel, and others who have tried repeatedly in 
various ways to destroy this organization. 
  Likewise, part of this answer said: Although inquiry and 
investigation is among the duties of the Majles, this is a 
matter that is judicial in nature. In an Islamic atmosphere, the 
most important qualifications for a judge are justice and 
impartiality. Unfortunately, Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh, a member 
of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, has a previous record in 
the Hojjatieh Society. He has expressed opposition since the 
year 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] to Mr. Hashemi's 
management, and especially during the incidents at the Voice and 
Vision organization in the year 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 
1984], which led to the dismissal of the executive director at 
that time by the Supervisory Council and the reappointment of 
Mr. Hashemi by the late Imam, Mr. Parvaresh and like-minded 
others said many things against the Imam's involvement and 
against his house, which displeased the Imam. In a written 
statement dated 4 Tir 1362 [25 June 1983], the Imam said: "It is 
necessary to mention that it has been heard that some people in 
my house are doing things against my wishes or without my 
knowledge. If this is not true, then the person who said this 
will be punished by God...." 
  Mr. Hashemi added that the presence of Mr. Parvaresh with 
his 
record on the Inquiry and Investigation Group undermines the 
groups "neutrality." Here the members present at this meeting 
said they did not know about Mr. Parvaresh's past and the events 
of the year 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] in the Voice and 
Vision organization. With reference to the record, they promised 
to observe neutrality and not to allow anyone to influence their 
vote and their views. 
  This answer also emphasized: Studying 1 million hours of 
programming and giving an opinion about it, and an official 
opinion at that, is something that is quite difficult. 
Considering the opponents and supporters of the Voice and Vision 
organization, the Inquiry and Investigation Group cannot base 
its judgement on hearsay. Rather it must conduct its own study 
and see the documented evidence for each instance where it wants 
to express an opinion. 
  Another part of the report says: On matters of religious 
jurisprudence, it was announced that since the late Imam, apart 
from the fact that he was the owner of the revolution and the 
founder of the sacred government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, was the most knowledgeable theologian and the clear source 
of emulation, on matters of religious jurisprudence in the Voice 
and Vision organization such as the way women should appear on 
television or on the issue of music, we have acted in accordance 
with the Imam's theological views. In cases like this a council 
cannot judge according to its own views. Rather it must declare 
its view in accordance with the fatwas and the views of the late 
Imam concerning the aforementioned issues. 
  In conclusion he announced that to avoid any kind of rumor 
about the organization not cooperating, which might be 
circulated by persons of ill will, or to allay any doubt, all 
the information and documents needed by the council should be 
requested in writing and the Voice and Vision organization will 
send you all the information in writing. 
  The answer from the Voice and Vision organization says: In 
the report that the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group 
broadcast from the Majles on 11 and 12 Aban [2 and 3 November], 
they did not mention any of the documents sent except in one or 
two cases. Rather, those making the report were completely 
unfair and in several parts of the report they made the 
declaration "despite the organization's failure to cooperate" or 
"despite the organization's failure to cooperate...." 
  The answer also adds: While reading the report Mr. Parvaresh 
announced that despite the organization's failure to cooperate, 
the Inquiry and Investigation Group obtained its information 
through sensitive and nonsensitive means! 
  Another part of this answer states: During the year while 
the 
research and investigation was under way, a lot of information 
about the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group was 
given to the Voice and Vision organization. In obedience to 
guidance from the late Imam (may Almighty God be pleased with 
him) and the exalted leader, may his life be long, and in view 
of the belief and faith that we have, we will not disclose it. 
We will mention in general one or two points, which are very 
significant in analyzing the group's report, because failure to 
observe these points might do serious damage to the realities: 
Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh has a record of activity in the 
Hojjatieh Society, and brief reference has been made to his way 
of thinking. Some of the group's other members also have a 
record of cooperation and activity in the Hojjatieh Society. 
  Likewise, another member of the group is married to the 
former spouse of an executed hypocrite as a second spouse, and 
he introduces her as the wife of a "martyr." Later it became 
clear, however, first of all that this person was the spouse of 
an executed hypocrite, and second that it was this very woman 
who drew her former spouse into the hypocrite group. 
  The way of thinking of some of the nonsensitive members of 
the Inquiry and Investigation Group is thus clear, with the 
"Hojjatiyehs," "hypocrites" and the views of "Hojjatiyehs" and 
"hypocrites" concerning the late Imam and the exalted leader and 
their friends. However, it is completely clear and there is no 
need here for further explanation. The complete text of the 
answer will be published in a subsequent issue.

<H5>  Mohammad Hashemi Rebels </H5>
  Even though 'Ali Khamene'i, the leader of the Islamic 
Republic, has the right of direct supervision over the radio and 
television of the Islamic Republic, in this organization the 
person who plays the first fiddle is still Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
Alongside 'Ali Khamene'i, Rafsanjani is the only official of the 
Islamic Republic who is mentioned by the Voice and Vision with 
the titles of "His Honor" and "His Reverence" and using 
third-person plural verbs instead of third-person singular. 
  With the publication of the harsh report of the Majles 
against the Voice and Vision, there is no longer the slightest 
doubt that Khamene'i wants to remove this important stronghold 
from Rafsanjani and also impose the rights that the laws have 
provided for the leader. 
  But, informed observers say, after placing $5 billion of his 
budget at the disposal of the Majles and after giving in to the 
pressures of the Majles and giving up the idea of having Mohsen 
Nurbakhsh as his minister of economic affairs and finance, if 
Rafsanjani loses this stronghold as well, he will no longer have 
any job to the end of the second (and last) term of his 
presidency except to go on a trip once in a while or entertain a 
foreign guest. 
  Informed sources say Rafsanjani wants to keep this 
stronghold 
at any price and for this reason has told his brother, Mohammad 
Hashemi, the general manager of the Voice and Vision, not to 
listen to anyone, even the leader of the Islamic Republic. And 
Mohammad Hashemi, by refusing the order of the leader, showed 
that he respects his older brother more than the successor to 
the "Imam." 
  The situation was that the leader of the Islamic Republic 
instructed the head of the Voice and Vision not to publish its 
response to the report of the Investigation Committee, but the 
Voice and Vision not only published its response but, as the 
saying goes, added other insults to what they had heard from the 
Majles and hurled them back. 
  Informed sources, which carefully monitor the events of the 
Islamic Republic, believe that the power struggle between the 
leader and the president has reached a point of no return for 
both sides.

  [Text] Yesterday the radio interrupted its normal 
programming, and in an unprecedented move, on the pretext of 
answering the report from the Majles Inquiry and Investigation 
Group concerning the performance of the Voice and Visage 
oganization, it insulted and accused the members of the Inquiry 
and Investigation Group and the deputies elected by the people. 
  1. In his answer, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi announced that "the 
Voice and Vision organization is managed under the supervision 
of the exalted leader. It has therefore always been the closest 
body to the exalted leader and the leadership."[.sup]1[/] Yet 
His Holiness Ayatollah Khamene'i, the exalted leader of the 
Islamic revolution, recently said clearly in answer to a letter 
from the speaker of the Majles that the Voice and Vision 
organization was not to answer the Majles, and said that doing 
this was not justifiable. 
  The Majles is the only power that has the right to inquire, 
investigate, and evaluate the performance of all the nation's 
organizations. The deputies can even interpellate the ministers 
and the government. Can those who have been investigated use the 
Voice and Vision organization to defend themselves again? 
  Mr. Mohammad Hashemi first laid the groundwork for heresy 
during the Majles vote of confidence for the minister of 
petroleum, and yesterday he continued in this. During the Majles 
vote of confidence for the minister of petroleum, an opponent 
discussed the bad performance of an organization affiliated with 
this ministry. An opportunity to respond was afforded both to 
the minister and to supporters, and this matter was concluded. 
However, a long time after the vote of confidence for the 
ministers, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi broadcast that organization's 
answer over the Majles radio. During Engineer Yahyavi's response 
to this act, in an insulting response, with disrespect and 
sarcasm concerning Engineer Yahyavi's 10 years of imprisonment 
in the Iraqi Government's black pits, he defended what he did. 
  This time Mr. Mohammad Hashemi used the national radio 
network. He repeatedly interrupted regular programming to insult 
the Majles deputies. 
  Can Mr. Hashemi, without the approval of the exalted leader, 
turn the Voice and Vision into a personal forum, when it should 
be broadcasting the views of the vice-regency of the chief 
jurisconsult, and use it to revile and abuse people who came to 
the Majles by a direct vote of the people? 
  2. In his answer Mr. Mohammad Hashemi says that before the 
inquiry and investigation he went to the Majles commission and 
divided the people of society into two groups, those who support 
and those who oppose the Voice and Vision organization. He said 
that the hypocrites, the leftist groups, the Hojjatieh Society 
and those who support America, Israel, and the monarchists are 
the main opponents. Then, clearly interfering in the work of the 
commission, he protested the fact that Mr. Parvaresh is a member 
of this commission. What must be done with someone who was in 
America during the heat of the revolution and is now saying that 
deputies elected by the people have the intellectual qualities 
of the hypocrites and the Hojjatieh Society? Do such heavy 
accusations against the deputies of the people conform to 
Islamic culture or American culture, especially when he attacks 
Mr. Parvaresh, who went to prison, was abused by the accursed 
shah, is reviled by the hypocrites and the Hojjatieh, and served 
as minister and deputy Majles speaker for several terms after 
the revolution? 
  Before the Inquiry and Investigation Commission began its 
work, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi told them that those who oppose him 
will be considered supporters of Israel, the hypocrites, and the 
Hojjatieh. We have seen that he made those very accusations 
against the commission's members after the inquiry and 
investigation report was read. Notice: "The intellectual 
qualities of some of the insensitive members of the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group is clear: Hojjatieh and 
hypocrites!"[.sup]2[/] 
  Things similar to this have been reflected repeatedly in the 
answers from the Voice and Vision organization. 
  3. One of the reasons some officials feel immunity and 
easily 
step out of their domain is the judiciary's failure to 
investigate their crimes promptly. We remember how, during the 
election for president of the republic, Mr. Mohammad Hashemi 
took it upon himself, in violation of the law, to publish a 
statement against one of the candidates for president of the 
republic, or to edit his speech, a measure that met with the 
exalted leader's opposition. If the judiciary had promptly 
investigated the complaints of these candidates, the supervisor 
of the Voice and Vision organization would not have dared this 
time to deal in this ugly and damaging way with the sacred body 
of the Majles. 
  God forbid, if the judiciary does not deal with such crimes, 
it will lead to insecurity and increased insults and accusations 
against government bodies and the elected deputies to the Majles.

  [Text] Unfortunately, in an unprecedented move on the 
pretext of answering the report from the Inquiry Group, the 
Voice and Vision organization made political accusations against 
the Majles deputies, comparing them to the hypocrite and 
Hojjatieh minigroups. 
  Of course these accusations will be studied and pursued in 
due course by the appropriate authorities. The rights of the 
Majles deputies must be defended, and they have the same right 
as any citizen of the Islamic Republic to express their views on 
current national affairs, so that, God forbid, conditions will 
not develop where anyone will dare to say that any kind of 
opposition to him is equivalent to opposition to the Imam (peace 
be upon him) and that his opponents are aligned with America and 
Israel. 
  Of course in the recent past certain people also tried, 
under 
cover of Imam Khomeyni's (peace be upon him) oppression, to 
divert his path and to oppose the vice-regency of the chief 
jurisconsult, and they were unable to do so! 
  Apart from the insults, so far the Voice and Vision 
organization has not answered concerning the measures it plans 
to take to prevent the repeat of at least four instances which 
led to memos from the exalted leader. 
  So far the management of the Voice and Vision organization 
has given no answer concerning what it has done, more than four 
years later, to implement the exalted leader's clear order to 
prepare a Voice and Vision organization administration bill. His 
Holiness gave this order in writing when he appointed Mr. 
Mohammad Hashemi chief of the Voice and Vision organization on 
6/2/1368 [24 August 1989]. 
  "It is required that a bill on the Voice and Vision 
organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran Administration Law 
be prepared and submitted to the government and the Majles 
quickly for passage through the approval process." According to 
the research and investigation report, so far that has not been 
done. 
  In the research and investigation report numerous instances 
are cited of the Voice and Vision organization management's 
inattention to the organization's charter, and at least eleven 
instances of violations of the law are given. 
  A quick review of the contents of the research and 
investigation report reinforces the belief in the reader that 
the management of the Voice and Vision organization seems to 
think that the organization's independence means their personal 
control of the organization, that they think themselves above 
all the competent bodies in the government, and that they see no 
reason to honor the rights of the other bodies in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. It is perhaps this kind of thinking that 
justifies his manner of dealing with the Majles. 
  Perhaps it was the result of this kind of thinking that made 
the National Investigation organization wonder about the Voice 
and Vision organization management's failure to follow up with 
judicial authorities on the case of the collapse of the 
satellite building. 
  Perhaps it was the result of this kind of thinking that 
prompted the Policy Council appointed by the exalted leader to 
protest because the measures approved by the council were not 
announced to the pertinent units, and consequently were not 
enforced. Why doesn't the executive director give reports to the 
council every two months, as required by law? 
  Perhaps it is the result of this kind of thinking that 
caused 
the organization's security chief to be appointed without the 
cooperation and approval of the Ministry of Intelligence. 
Perhaps it is because of this kind of thinking that personnel 
violations are not collected and a report on them is not given 
to the Ministry of Intelligence. 
  The natural result of such dealings is the suffering, 
expulsion, and isolation of Hezbollah forces, the clearest 
manifestation of which is the basijis in the Victory Tradition 
Group. 
  Under such circumstances naturally the remnants of the 
former 
regime in the organization are present and powerful enough that 
they are able to keep files on the Hezbollah forces for the 
crime of protesting their performance. An individual who 
resigned and was arrested because of relations with deviators 
was even appointed manager of the Voice and Vision organization 
in one of the provinces! 
  With things like this going on in the Voice and Vision 
organization, it is natural that there is little room there for 
the growth and authority of 100-percent committed forces in the 
critical Voice and Vision organization. 
  It is certain that a careful follow-up on the report from 
the 
Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group by the competent 
authorities, without any kind of public controversy, will 
prevent some people from being deluded by the idea that dealing 
with individuals is to be done according to their official 
connections and not according to what they have done!

<F P=106> [Editorial by Political Section] </F>
  [Text] The broadcast of the answer from the Voice and 
Vision organization to the Majles Inquiry and Investigation 
Group continues to be a serious issue in domestic political 
circles. In this regard the following points are worthy of 
notice and further discussion: 
  1. There is no doubt that the broadcast of the Voice and 
Vision organization's answer over the national radio network was 
irresponsible, because Article 76 of the Constitution states 
that the Majles has the clear right to research and investigate 
all the nation's affairs. 
  Apart from its insults to the sacred Majles and its 
respected 
deputies, the answer from the Voice and Vision organization did 
not have sufficient evidence. 
  Even assuming that there was material in the report from the 
Inquiry and Investigation Group that does not conform to 
reality, the authority to determine that is not the body that is 
being investigated! That body can defend itself in a judicial 
trial and if any right has been violated, it can take steps to 
vindicate its rights. Otherwise, all the bodies and 
organizations investigated would want to investigate and even 
judge and issue an opinion about the work of the Majles, 
including any report it issues about their own organization, and 
such a right is not given in the Constitution to any body, 
organization or government unit in any of the ordinary laws or 
the Constitution. 
  2. From the failure to broadcast the subsequent portions of 
the answer from the Voice and Vision organization, it appears 
that this decision was precipitous and hasty, and a violation. 
The question arises, why does the supervisor of the Voice and 
Vision organization act on his own in matters of such 
importance? What is the penalty for doing this? 
  3. The question of the competence of a deputy or deputies is 
the concern of the executive councils, the Guardian Council and 
also the Majles. This matter is pursued by the deputies 
themselves at the beginning of each term. In any case, a deputy 
who has taken a seat in the Majles is competent in the eyes of 
the people who voted for him and also in the eyes of the 
deputies themselves. How is it possible that his competence can 
be questioned by a body that has been investigated for improper 
performance? 
  The insults to the sacred Majles and its deputies, which are 
in the first part of the answer from the Voice and Vision 
organization, are unprecedented, and the Voice and Vision 
organization certainly must make amends. 
  Public opinion expects the honor of the deputies who have 
been slandered to be restored. 
  4. Among the insults, which have been improperly propagated, 
is the claim that is in the first of the answer from the Voice 
and Vision organization in the sacred presence of Imam Khomeyni 
(peace be upon him). Although the criticism in the answer is 
useless and it contains completely incorrect material, it is not 
without benefit to mention the following in order to reveal for 
readers the logic of those who prepared the answer. 
  The answer from the Voice and Vision organization states: 
"The goals of the Voice and Vision organization are guidance, 
training, information, education, recreation, amusement. This 
organization has never once broadcast a neutral program and it 
does not do so. All the programs have goals and are educational. 
This is not a claim that the Voice and Vision organization is 
making, this is the opinion of His Holiness the Imam, may God be 
pleased with him, in the fall of 1366 [1987]." 
  Although in a message in the year 1366 [21 March 1987-20 
March 1988] His Holiness the Imam said "violations are sometimes 
rarely seen, and one must be more vigilant." The officials of 
the Voice and Vision organization believe that they have not 
broadcast a neutral program even once, and they have also 
connected that to the Imam's testimony. 
  First of all, the Imam's blessed manuscript pertains to what 
had been broadcast, not to what would be broadcast in the 
future. Second, His Holiness the Imam said "violations are 
sometimes rarely seen." Thus it is not as the gentlemen claim, 
not even once. 
  Third, has the supervisor of the Voice and Vision 
organization forgotten that on 8/10/1367 [1 November 1988] the 
Imam wrote a harsh letter protesting what was being broadcast by 
the Voice of the Islamic Republic? 
  For Mr. Hashemi's information, we present His Holiness the 
Imam's opinion: 
  In the name of the Almighty 
  Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, executive director of the Voice and 
Vision organization of the Islamic Republic: 
  It is absolutely regrettable and sad that yesterday 
(Saturday, 8 Bahman [28 January]) material was broadcast over 
the Voice of the Islamic Republic on the model for women, which 
one is ashamed to repeat. The person that broadcast these things 
is to be punished and fired and those involved in this will be 
punished. If it is proved that there was an intentional insult, 
without a doubt the person making the insult will be condemned 
to death. If this sort of thing is repeated, it will mean severe 
and serious punishment and penalties for the high-level 
officials of the Voice and Vision organization. Of course the 
judiciary will take steps in all areas. 
  11/9/1367 [29 January 1988] Ruhollah al-Musavi al-Khomeyni 
  Do you still claim that all the programs are educational? 
Now 
answer, which of the Voice and Vision organization's goals were 
being pursued by insulting the sacred things of Islam, in such a 
way as to draw a protest from His Holiness the Imam (peace be 
upon him)? Was it guidance, education, information, information, 
training, recreation or entertainment? 
  Apart from any kind of penalties that the law may set for 
him, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization 
certainly must remember the holy presence of His Holiness the 
Imam in relation to the violation he has committed and he must 
also apologize to the deputies of the Majles

  [Text] 1. In the last few months the Voice and Vision 
organization has done things that are clear and prominent 
examples of what can be called despotism and law breaking. 
  Apparently the management of the Voice and Vision 
organization does not realize that one of the genuine and 
emphatic demands of the people of Iran in the years before and 
after the triumph of the sacred Islamic revolution was and is 
preservation of the sanctity and greatness of human beings. One 
of the great benefits that the revolution brought for the 
patient and heroic people of Iran is the Islamic Majles, which 
has taken shape with their votes, their views and their demands. 
A responsible Majles is based on the nation's Constitution and 
guarding the nation's rights, and no official has the right to 
violate the lawfulness prevailing over the words and deeds of 
the deputies and the Majles. 
  In reality, the experts who wrote and approved the 
Constitution wrote articles and paragraphs about the rights of 
the nation's deputies, which would bring national maturity, and 
under which the ones chosen by society would be able to exercise 
careful and comprehensive supervision over all society's affairs 
in the light of a mass movement. With the cooperation and 
assistance of the judiciary, they would be able to prevent any 
kind of abuse of social or government position and 
responsibility, and to lead the nation's law-making process 
towards vindicating the rights of the people. 
  The recent acts by the Voice and Vision organization are a 
serious warning, and ignoring this warning will lead to more 
frightening and fearsome consequences. In reality, what has 
happened during this period is a warning about the danger of 
destroying the human sanctity and greatness and the nation's 
social rights. Some people, in doing these things, have shown 
their astonishing talent for continuing their obstinate and 
dictatorial activities. 
  The truth is that what is more worrying and frightening than 
anything else is the social developments, and especially the 
effects of the acts on the social spirit, maturity, and thought. 
Truly, if the people see that the nation's most extensive media 
deals in this way with their deputies, and if the judicial 
authorities do not deal with their lawbreaking seriously and 
quickly, won't the people be right in thinking that their 
freedom and social security are in danger of being assaulted by 
lawbreakers? 
  Aren't the newspaper writers concerned, and aren't they 
asking themselves, if the attitude and behavior of the 
supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization spreads to the 
nation's other sectors, what will happen to the right to think 
and the sacred freedom that the revolution, the Imam and the 
martyrs have given them? 
  2. After the heroic nation of Iran shook off years of 
domination by despotic and selfish shahs, its back wounded by 
the lashes of the shah's oppressive henchmen, it found a new 
awakening under the influence of the religious and peaceful 
thought and ideas of Seyyed Jamal al-Din Asadabadi. After this, 
led by great people such as Sheykh Shahid 'Alameh Fazlollah 
Nuri, it established the "house of justice" movement, but 
unfortunately that seed did not bear fruit. It was beset by such 
a plague that in a short time it was barren and dry. 
  The Islamic revolution gave the people a house of justice, 
and the blood of great ones such as Sheykh Fazlollah and 
Sattarkhan bore fruit after several decades and brought forth a 
Majles that forms every four years with a vote of the people. 
  Therefore, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision 
organization must realize that this nation has never lost its 
historical memory, and it will never allow its own house (the 
Majles) to be attacked through acts that are not worthy of a 
manager in the Islamic government. Our path has been rocky from 
the house of justice to the Majles, and we will never go back. 
  3. There is now no doubt that the acts of the supervisor of 
the Voice and Vision organization were noting more than an 
effort to deter the nation's deputies from the performance of 
their duties as deputies and especially to deter them from 
keeping the vow they have taken. Apart from the fact that the 
brave deputies of the people are the heirs of the freedom, 
bravery and steadfastness of the great martyr Modarres and Imam 
Khomeyni (peace be upon him), public controversy and assaults on 
honor such as these cannot deter them from their critical 
mission as deputies.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Mohammad Sarafraz] </F>
  [Text] It is clear from the outward manifestations that the 
supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization's heresy in his 
special way of answering the report from the Majles Inquiry and 
Investigation Group was a beginning for greater heresy! Why was 
the answer from the Voice and Vision organization heresy? There 
are two main reasons: 1) The repeated interruption of national 
radio network programming to answer the Majles; 2) Clear insults 
and accusations against the Majles deputies and the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group, and consequently the Majles, as the 
nation's most important body. 
  Of course, the precedent for this was the insult against Mr. 
Yahyavi, deputy from Tehran. Mr. Yahyavi spent 10 years of his 
life in the black pits of the Iraqi Ba'thist regime, and the 
people of Tehran appreciated him greatly. However, the 
supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization dealt with him 
in this way, and used the tools of the Voice and Vision 
organization as a personal tool. 
  The preliminary step for all votes taken in the Majles is 
the 
expression of views by supporters and opponents, and the Voice 
and Vision organization does not have the right to broadcast a 
statement supporting one against the other. The things the Voice 
and Vision organization did during the vote of confidence for 
the government were done in the interest of one government 
minister, and after a long time it broadcast an answer. 
  But what is the greater heresy? 
  In its last answer to the Majles public relations office the 
Voice and Vision organization laid the groundwork for these 
instances: 1) Preventing the direct broadcast of Majles 
proceedings; 2) Preventing the publication of pre-agenda 
speeches, research and investigation reports and anything that 
has to do with Majles supervisory responsibilities. 
  In his answer, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision 
organization mentioned Article 69 of the 
Constitution[.sup]1[/], and he emphasized the broadcast of 
Majles proceedings. "If the Constitution had intended the 
broadcast of proceedings and sessions, it would not have used 
the term `report,' and instead of that, for example, it would 
have been written that `proceedings should be broadcast by radio 
without alteration for public information.'" 
  Now there is the supposition that the broadcast of a 
"report" 
on Majles proceedings by a radio announcer during the "direct 
broadcast" of Majles proceedings could prepare the way for not 
broadcasting the proceedings directly. Are such masterpieces 
really the work of one person, or is something afoot to bring 
despotism back by putting pressure on the Majles and limiting 
its legal prerogatives? 
  Of course, one person or even a movement are too small to 
destroy the fruits of 15 years of freedom for the aware nation 
of Iran. All the nation's forces are under the supervision of 
the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult and the way to 
dictatorship and despotism is closed. The firm principles of the 
Constitution bespeak this important truth. However, with regard 
to the latest answer from the supervisor of the Voice and Vision 
organization, one must note the following points: 
  A. In this answer the supervisor of the Voice and Vision 
organization sees himself as being much larger than his true 
size. Playing the role of the Guardian Council, he has set out 
to interpret Article 69 of the Constitution, he does not 
consider the full publication of Majles proceedings to include 
the pre-agenda speeches and other things, and he wants to stop 
the direct broadcast of the proceedings. 
  In his answer to the Majles, the supervisor of the Voice and 
Vision organization also plays the role of the judiciary, 
saying: "The Voice and Vision organization is legally required 
to stop the broadcast of accusations and incorrect statements by 
the Inquiry and Investigation Commission during the direct 
broadcast by the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic." 
  Then he adds, "since the research and investigation report 
was broadcast directly on the radio, the possibility for us to 
monitor it, obey the law and do our job was taken away from us." 
  That is, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization 
must determine where there is a problem in the research and 
investigation report and prevent its broadcast! 
  In his prior answer, he also interfered in the work of the 
Majles. He asked the Inquiry and Investigation Group to dismiss 
some of its members. He implied that those who oppose him would 
be accused of being members of minigroups and being opposed to 
the Imam! 
  B. Instead of apologizing to the Majles, the Inquiry and 
Investigation Group and the deputies, against whom he made heavy 
accusations, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization 
continued with his illegal and religiously unlawful activities 
by trying to make justifications and interpretations. 
  It would be better if he would explain which of the above 
authorities prevented the radio broadcast of the answers from 
the Voice and Vision organization in order to make these kinds 
of obstinate activities clear to everyone. It must be noted that 
Iran's Islamic government rests firmly on the basis of the 
vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult and the firm principles 
of the Constitution. The vice-regent has the last word in all 
affairs. No person or organization can interfere in the work of 
the government organizations and create confusion. 
  C. In the Constitution the Majles has such a high position 
that anyone who has a complaint about the work of the Majles, 
the executive power or the judiciary can submit his complaint in 
writing to the Majles and the Majles is required to investigate 
these complaints and to announce the result. 
  Therefore,the Voice and Vision organization does not have 
the 
responsibility to investigate the oppression of individuals and 
it cannot act in accordance with a measure enacted by the 
Supervisory Council of the Voice and Vision organization, which 
has been eliminated in the revised version of the Constitution.

  [Text] When the Voice and Vision organization willfully 
broadcast the petrochemical company's answer to the Engineer 
Yahyavi's extemporaneous remarks (during deliberations on his 
vote of confidence as a minister), the belief was that this move 
by the management of the Voice and Vision organization was done 
merely out of an incorrect interpretation of regulations, but 
the broadcast of a new statement from the Voice and Vision 
organization concerning further remarks by Engineer Yahyavi on 
the Voice of the Majles undermined the earlier analysis of the 
Voice and Vision organization's behavior. 
  No one believed, however, that in a short time those running 
the Voice and Vision organization would put the secrets of their 
hearts on paper, and to show everyone the dreams they had for 
the future of the government and the nation. Apparently the 
supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization was issuing a 
warning about the violation of Paragraph 6, Article 3 of the 
Constitution. Paragraph 6, Article 3 of the Constitution is "the 
elimination of all forms of tyranny and autocracy and all 
attempts to monopolize power." 
  A review of all the comments of the nation's experts in 
studying and approving the Constitution shows that they were 
under a heavy cloud of worry and apprehension. The experience of 
the decades before the Islamic revolution and the base qualities 
of individuals has shown that this apprehension goes beyond the 
ordinary. 
  Here and there in the deliberations of the experts during 
the 
writing of the Constitution, much effort was made so that the 
government system in this nation beset by despotism would be 
arranged in such a way that the powerful governing bodies would 
be controlled by each other, that ultimately all would come 
together under the leadership of a single just theologian, and 
that no person or body would have absolute power except the 
absolute vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult. 
  The division of responsibilities among the three powers, the 
recommendation of the ministers by the president of the republic 
to the Majles and the final decision making by the Majles in 
this matter, the election of the president of the republic by 
the nation, the study of his lack of political qualifications, 
and even questioning and interpellating him in the Majles (after 
the revision of the Constitution), the possibility of 
complaining about the work methods of the three powers, the 
study of the complaints in this regard by the Majles Article 90 
Commission, Majles research and investigation of all the 
nation's affairs and other things, all make it possible for the 
deputies of the people to monitor and supervise all individuals 
and organizations. 
  In this statement by the supervisor of the Voice and Vision 
organization concerning the violation of the principles in the 
Constitution, there are many claims and excesses, which are 
questionable, although their falseness is clear and obvious: 
  The executive director of the Voice and Vision organization 
claims first of all that the research and investigation report 
contains accusations, slander and assaults on the reputations of 
individuals. Second, he claims that according to Article 39 of 
the Constitution, even assaulting the reputation and dignity of 
convicts and prisoners is forbidden and subject to punishment, 
as well as the individual and collective reputations of those 
running the government. Third, Article 171 of the Constitution 
gives people who have been subjected to accusations the right to 
defend themselves and it makes it obligatory to restore their 
spiritual and material reputations and dignity. Fourth, he 
claims that Articles 6 and 19 of the Law on General Policies and 
Principles of the Voice and Vision organization's programming 
and the measure enacted by the Supervisory Council in 1363 [21 
March 1984-20 March 1985], required him to broadcast the 
statement against the Majles. 
  A. Article 39 of the Constitution states that "affronts to 
the honor and dignity of criminals are forbidden and subject to 
punishment." Article 37 also says that "no one is to be regarded 
as guilty unless his guilt has been established by the competent 
court." 
  Article 159 says clearly "the Ministry of Justice is the 
official body to which all grievances and complaints are to be 
referred." 
  If a crime has been committed (affront to honor, etc.), the 
authority to determine the crime and set and implement the 
punishments is the judiciary, not the supervisor of the Voice 
and Vision organization. 
  He has apparently cut himself out and stitched himself 
together out of whole cloth. Does the supervisor of the Voice 
and Vision organization think he does not need to go through the 
legal procedures? 
  B. Apparently the executive director of the Voice and Vision 
organization has read Article 171 of the Constitution from 
beginning to end. Consider Article 171 carefully: "If an 
individual suffers moral or material harm as the result of a 
failure or error of the judge with respect to the subject matter 
of a case, the verdict delivered, or the implementation of the 
verdict, the judge must stand surety for the reparation of that 
harm in accordance with Islamic criteria, if it be a case of 
failure. Otherwise, losses will be compensated for by the 
government. In all cases, the repute and good standing of the 
individual will be restored." 
  The executive director has made this article one of his 
justifications. He declares: Article 171 of the Constitution 
gives people who have been subjected to accusations the right to 
defend themselves and it makes it obligatory to restore their 
spiritual and material reputations and dignity. 
  The difference is like the difference between night and day. 
Article 171 pertains to the duties of the judiciary, and it 
requires the judge and the government to compensate for losses 
caused and to restore the honor of the accused person. However 
the Voice and Vision organization, clearly distorting this 
article, heaps heresy upon heresy and says that the accused must 
defend himself. Perhaps he also fancies himself in the role of 
the government, and is eager to enforce this article of the 
Constitution! 
  Does the fact that he attends meetings of the Council of 
Ministers make him think he can speak for the government? 
  C. Under Article 6 of the law on the General Policies and 
Principles of the Voice and Vision organization, this 
organization is required to respect the human dignity of 
individuals and to refrain from affronting their honor, in 
accordance with Islamic regulations. Article 19 says: "In all 
programming, especially the news, items may not be broadcast 
that contain the following: insults to the nation's official 
bodies and organizations and..." 
  1. The name of this law is "Law on the General Policies and 
Principles of the Voice and Vision Organization." This means 
that the programs produced by the Voice and Vision organization 
must be produced and broadcast in observance of the provisions 
given in this law. This is not to be extended to what is outside 
the lawful responsibility of the Voice and Vision organization 
and to what the Voice and Vision organization merely implements. 
  With regard to the broadcast of open Majles session 
proceedings, under the Constitution (which governs all laws, 
including the law cited above), the Voice and Vision 
organization is required to do these broadcasts. If a crime is 
committed, other bodies are the authorities to determine that 
and deal with it, not the Voice and Vision organization. 
  If the claims of the executive director of the Voice and 
Vision organization were to be implemented, before making any 
kind of speech in the Majles or at a Friday prayer service the 
deputies and the speaker of the Majles, the Friday imams at the 
provincial centers, the president of the republic, the chief of 
the judiciary and others would have to submit their speeches in 
writing to the management of the Voice and Vision organization 
so he could correct them and authorize their delivery if they 
achieved a minimum score, so that there would be no violations 
in the broadcast!

<F P=106> [Editorial by 'Alireza Shemirani] </F>
  [Text] Why have the acts of the supervisor of the Voice and 
Vision organization during the last two weeks been followed by 
numerous reactions, from the speaker and deputies of the Majles 
to the chief of the judiciary, the Friday imams and the clergy, 
various classes and guilds and the media? 
  So far the Majles has researched and investigated at various 
levels in numerous instances having to do with the performance 
of organizations, bodies and management, in implementation of 
Article 67 of the Constitution. However, none have received 
reactions on the scale of the latest incident. Perhaps this is 
for the following reasons: 
  A. The performance of the Voice and Vision organization, as 
the most important pillar of the fourth power, with its 
effective and fateful role and society, has never been 
officially examined and supervised in the period since the 
triumph of the Islamic revolution. Since the revision of the 
Constitution, the Voice and Vision organization has been under 
the direct supervision of the vice-regent, and some have thought 
that a body under the leader's supervision should not be studied 
and subjected to research and investigation. At the time the 
research and investigation of the performance of the Voice and 
Vision organization was proposed, his excellency clearly stated: 
  "Study it carefully, do the research and investigation, and 
study individuals, too." 
  B. After the research and investigation report was read in 
the Majles, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization, 
continuing his illegal measures, took an official position 
against research and investigation on the Voice of the Majles. 
He drew boundaries and directions for the Majles, and by 
creating public controversy and intimidating the deputies, he 
tried to keep the Majles from performing its lawful 
responsibilities. He threatened that if things were said in the 
open Majles sessions that he judged to be incorrect, they would 
be answered in Voice and Vision programming. 
  C. The continuation of the illegal measures involving the 
personal use of the Voice and Vision and the failure to heed 
notices given caused the exalted leader to intervene and prevent 
the radio broadcast of further installments of the answer to the 
Majles from the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization. 
The unworthy acts of the supervisor of the Voice and Vision 
organization were that in subsequent portions of the answer to 
the Majles and also on his answer to the statement given to the 
press from the Majles public relations office, he made 
inappropriate and distorted use of the Constitution and ordinary 
laws to try to justify broadcasting his answer over the radio. 
Instead of apologizing to the leader and the Majles and 
realizing the illegality of his willful use of the resources of 
the Voice and Vision organization, he continued to insist on his 
position. 
  Did any of the Majles deputies, the Friday imams, clergymen 
or writers who took a position on this matter prevent the 
supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization from pursuing 
the issues in the research and investigation through legal 
channels? No, everyone said and wrote that if he believed his 
honor had been attacked or if his rights had been violated, he 
should pursue the matter through lawful authorities, but he 
cannot violate the Constitution and ordinary laws, including 
Article 49 of the Law on the General Policies and Principles of 
the Programs of the Voice and Vision organization, which 
emphatically prohibit any kind of illegal activity in the 
country, by laying the groundwork for heresy that distorts to 
high heaven. 
  Article 6 of the Law on the General Policies and Principles 
of the Programs of the Voice and Vision Organization, which 
happens also to have been cited by the manager of the Voice and 
Vision organization, states: respect the human dignity of 
individuals and refrain from affronting their honor, in 
accordance with Islamic regulations." In the answer from the 
Voice and Vision organization, which was broadcast over the 
radio, this provision was clearly violated, and the honor of the 
Majles deputies was affronted. 
  If it is to be established in an Islamic system, which 
negates selfishness, that individuals can promote their ideas by 
intimidating the nation's lawful bodies, the edifice will not 
stand. This is the issue that took the issue of the research and 
investigation of the performance of the Voice and Vision 
organization beyond the ordinary course of events, and the 
controversy will continue as long as there is continued refusal 
to submit to the law. 
  The philosophy of research and investigation depends on the 
proper conduct of affairs, the discovery of incorrectness and 
distortions, and dealing with violators. Its purpose will be 
defeated if the body or individuals being investigated and 
researched heedlessly continue with what they were doing. 
  The roots of many problems and violations in some bodies and 
organizations are to be found in selfishness and the failure to 
submit to laws. If these roots are not cut off, they will grow 
again and their branches and leaves will be everywhere.

that a high-ranking Kuwaiti military delegation has arrived in 
Moscow from London to hold preliminary talks with the Russian 
military command. The talks, the sources added, will deal with 
some Russian military systems which Kuwait is interested in. 
  The Kuwaiti delegation comprises officers from the Ground 
Forces and the Navy. The sources noted that Kuwait is mainly 
interested in the Russian-made BMB2 armored personnel carrier 
[APC]. Kuwait, which has 40 of this type of carrier, wants to 
purchase 20 more in addition to 60 of the new generation BMB3 
carrier. 
  The cost of the 20 carriers of the first type is estimated 
at 
between $25 and $30 million. Kuwait will also purchase trucks 
to be used in support missions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Kuwaiti Defense Minister Confirms </F>
Intention To Conclude Military Agreement with China"] 
  [Text] Kuwait, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Kuwaiti Defense 
Minister Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah has confirmed that Kuwait intends 
to conclude a defense agreement with the Chinese Republic but 
denied any inclination to hold a similar agreement with Italy. 
  He said that the dialogue between the Kuwaiti and Chinese 
sides is continuing, in order to agree on a formula for a 
defense agreement, and expressed hope that the agreement will be 
concluded in the near future. 
  In a statement to reporters yesterday, Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah 
said that Kuwait's policy on security agreements confines them 
to the UN Security Council permanent member states to the 
exclusion of others. He added that Kuwait has no intention of 
concluding security agreements with any Arab state. He said: 
There are previous agreements in this connection such as the 
"Damascus Declaration" and the "Arab Joint Defense Pact" within 
the framework of the Arab League. 
  In reply to a question from AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the Kuwaiti 
defense minister denied that joint Kuwaiti-Italian naval 
exercises were held with a view to concluding a security 
agreement with Italy. 
  Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah stressed that the Kuwaiti force in 
Somalia operating within the UN's UNOSOM-2 will continue to 
perform its humanitarian duties until the United Nations 
terminates its UNOSOM-2 operation in Somalia. 
  On the defense budget supplement for the Kuwaiti Army, left 
pending at the National Assembly since last year, Shaykh 'Ali 
al-Sabah said that he "considers it to have been approved, 
having been passed by the National Assembly's Interior and 
Defense Affairs Committee." 
  In reply to a question about the body found in the 
Palestinian embassy building in Kuwait, the minister said that 
it has not been identified yet and that the investigations are 
continuing.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Normalization"] </F>
  [Text] Ever since countries in the region began to talk 
about normalizing relations with the Arab countries classified 
as Kuwait's opposers due to their known stand toward the wicked 
Iraqi aggression, Kuwait's stand began to fluctuate between a 
categorical rejection and an ambiguous acceptance of such 
normalization. It was finally decided to make normalization 
conditional on a commitment to the UN Security Council 
resolutions on the war for the liberation of Kuwait. This was 
considered an alternative to a public appology that necessarily 
meant an admission of being a real participant in the Iraqi 
crime of occupation. This was not the exact truth because these 
countries only adopted passive roles which the Iraqi regime 
utilized in order to serve its claims. 
  Some may say these countries' roles went beyond being just 
passive to taking the form of politcial and media support for 
the occupation crime. However, this was only the result of 
their being surprised and deceived when they all made a legend 
of Saddam Husayn. We all participated in portraying him as such, 
and perhaps we were the first to glorify the guardian of the 
Arab homeland's Eastern Gate who, in reality, was a monster in 
our midst. 
  Now that talk about normalization has stopped, the 
government 
has failed to take a tangible step toward those countries that 
responded to the Kuwaiti condition and unequivocally announced 
they support international resolutions, Kuwait's right to 
sovereignty, the return of prisoners, and the payment of 
compensations. Here, we mean Yemen and Tunisia, who have 
repeatedly recited the prayer of repentance after they started 
to see clearly and became aware of the Iraqi monster and the 
tragic effects the crime of occupation has had on the Arab 
world. What else is needed to overcome estrangement and restore 
normal relations? 
  We believe Kuwait is dutybound to extend its hand toward 
Tunisia and Yemen and for us to clear our hearts of feelings of 
blame in order to build, on the ruins of the past, a firm 
foundation for strong ties that end estrangement and provide an 
opportunity for interaction among Arab efforts to tighten the 
siege on the rabid monster who is gritting his teeth in hatred. 
We ought to admit that we were the first to be decieved and the 
first to acclaim the "Arabs' knight". It is now time for us to 
wake up from our daze and seek the right way to rebuild what the 
wicked invasion had destroyed of the wall of our Arab relations. 
The thicker the wall the less the danger of the monster lurking 
behind the borders will be.

<F P=106> [Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq report: "Abu-Dhabi: Our Dispute </F>
Is Over Sovereignty, Not Borders"] 
  [Text] Abu-Dhabi -- A high-ranking United Arab Emirates 
[UAE] diplomatic source has stated that "pending issues" is no 
longer an acceptable title for the dialogue with Iran on the 
three occupied UAE islands of Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and 
Abu-Musa. 
  The UAE source said that the UAE had agreed to discuss its 
dispute with Iran over the three islands under the heading 
"pending issues" in order to "persuade Iran to discuss the 
question of its occupation of the three islands, but it then 
became evident that Iran was trying to use that label to keep 
the issue in flux and to dither." 
  The source said that Iranian Interior Minister Mohammad 'Ali 
Besharati's recent statements in Doha were unacceptable and part 
of the contradictory statements made by Iranian officials from 
time to time. The UAE source added that "the UAE's dispute with 
Iran over the three islands is not a dispute over borders but a 
dispute over sovereignty." He said the UAE had reservations 
about the conclusions reached at the Paris seminar on the 
islands held last summer. 
  The diplomatic source said that Iran's nonacceptance of 
direct dialogue on the three islands reflected the weakness of 
Iran's legal position on the issue of sovereignty over the 
islands. He said that "had Iran had any legal or historical 
documents, it would not have hesitated to agree to discuss the 
dispute directly or submit it to international legal bodies." 
  He emphasized that the weakness of the Iranian arguments was 
clear in the contacts and talks held on the dispute since the 
failed round of negotiations between the two countries in 
September 1992 in Abu-Dhabi. 
  The UAE source said that there are currently no contacts 
with 
Iran on the islands but added that the UAE has not lost all hope 
for the resumption of the negotiations. He noted in this 
connection that "the conflicting statements made by Iranian 
officials leave the door open for the resumption of the 
negotiations." He stressed that the UAE's options for raising 
the issue at international circles are still open and that its 
determination to fulfill its rights peacefully remains unchanged. 
  On the possibility of mediation on the dispute, he said that 
the UAE does not accept mediations and insists on frank and 
direct dialogue on the issue but he emphasized that it would not 
object to a delegation going to Tehran if there was a sincere 
intention to discuss the dispute over the three islands.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Jan 26 (AFP)--The strong economic 
relationship between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran has 
remained intact despite worsening political ties due to a 
dispute over three strategic Gulf islands. 
  Official Iranian figures released at a regional exhibition 
in 
al-Shariqah showed the UAE has remained the top Gulf commercial 
partner of Iran, while Tehran's exports to the Emirates have 
even increased. 
  UAE exports and re-exports to Iran stood at around three 
billion dirhams (817 million dollars) in 1993 and imports at 800 
million dirhams (218 million dollars), creating a surplus for 
the UAE of 599 million dollars. The figures were slightly 
higher than in 1992, when exports stood at around 800 million 
dollars and imports at 163 million dollars. 
  Most of Iran's imports from the UAE come from Dubai, the 
main 
commercial centre in the region. Hundreds of traders in Dubai 
are of Iranian origin, who assist businessmen from their country. 
  Most of the trade between the two countries is hauled by 
traditional Arabian wooden boats, dhows, hundreds of which ply 
the Gulf waters daily. 
  Iran's exports to the Emirates include mainly carpets, nuts 
and other foodstuffs while its imports include sugar, rice, cars 
and electronics. 
  Iranian businessmen said actual trade with the UAE was much 
higher as those figures do not include Iranian exports through 
the five free ports set up in the Emirates over the past few 
years. 
  Hundreds of Iranian boats converge on such ports loaded with 
home made products such as furniture, foodstuffs, clothes, home 
appliances, handicrafts and other light items. Trade through 
those ports, where the Iranians pay only token tariffs, is 
estimated at millions of dollars a month. 
  "Iran is an important commercial partner of our country as 
it 
takes nearly one third of our re-exports," a Dubai trade 
official said. "Its exports to us are also increasing and most 
of them are being re-exported to other countries. Iran relies 
mainly on Dubai to reach other markets." 
  Iran and the UAE have been locked in a dispute over the 
islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb, which control 
the vital Hormuz Strait through which nearly one fifth of the 
world's crude exports pass. 
  But the dispute has not affected their ties in other 
sectors. 
More than 150,000 Iranians stil live in the UAE and Iran has 
even boosted its participating in trade fairs in Dubai, 
al-Shariqah and other UAE emirates. 
  Such participation is part of Iran's attempts to boost 
non-oil exports to offset a decline in crude prices and revive 
its economy, wrecked by accumulating debts and the 1980-1988 war 
with neighbouring Iraq. 
  The latest participation was in an Arab-Asian exhibition 
being held in al-Shariqah and Iranian officials have already 
reported deals worth more than 1.5 million dollars in addition 
to negotiations for more sales. 
  "Some of the 28 participating Iranian companies are also 
conducting contacts to find trade agents in the emirates," said 
Ibrahim Khodai, spokesman for the Iranian pavilion at the fair. 
  He said the items displayed at the Iranian pavilion were 
worth more than 140 million dollars and included handicrafts, 
home appliances, furniture, chemicals, carpets, farming 
equipment and electronics. 
  "Iran is considering expanding its presence at such 
exhibitions given the large demand for our products," he said.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Jan 26 (AFP)--Libya has decided to reopen 
its embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after a closure of 
nearly 10 years, diplomats said here Wednesday. 
  The embassy will open in the next few months but Libya has 
already named Muhammad al-Fayturi as its charge d'affaires in 
the Emirates. 
  The foreign ministry acting undersecretary, Sayf Sa'id, met 
al- Fayturi on Tuesday "after Libya decided to reopen its 
diplomatic mission here," the official UAE news agency WAM said. 
  Libya closed its embassy in the UAE and several other 
countries in the mid-1980s apparently because it wanted to cut 
overspending due to a decline in oil prices, an Arab diplomat 
said. 
  It was not clear what prompted the latest move since oil 
prices have stayed weak. But the decision coincides with 
Libya's dispute with the West over the 1988 Lockerbie plane 
bombing. 
  The Gulf states -- oil producers like Libya -- have good 
ties 
with Washington and London, which demand the hand-over of two 
Libyan suspects in the bombing over the Scottish village of 
Lockerbie that cost 270 lives.

  [Excerpt] The time factor has been settled and it is all 
but definite that the reconciliation meeting between Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid will be held in Amman in the first week of next month, 
February. AL-DUSTUR has learned that the follow-up committee in 
charge of preparing for this meeting has asked the leaders of 
parties and national forces that will take part in this 
celebration to get ready for departure to Amman next Sunday. 
  In the meantime, Yemeni Parliament Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar is still dissatisfied with the way the 
document of understanding was issued. He insists that this 
document, which was initialed on 18 January, should be ratified 
by the House of Representatives, which is the constitutional 
body in the country. 
  The Yemeni parties are engaged in controversy over the point 
advanced by al-Ahmar. A bloc comprising the Yemeni Socialist 
Party, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the Right [al-Haqq] 
Party, and the Nasirite Popular Unionist Organization has 
emerged. It says that, based on past experience, what the House 
speaker is demanding is unnecessary. These parties, supported 
by many independents, do not believe the new document should 
pass through parliament. They say that none of the previous 
unity accords was ratified by the House of Representatives and 
that the new document is a covenant of honor and not a legal 
pact. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The rebel movement -- Garang's group -- has refused 
to open new safe land corridors from Kenya and Uganda and 
internal land corridors in the south of the country to transfer 
relief supplies to the affected areas, though the government of 
Sudan had agreed to open land corridors and offered all 
concessions for transporting relief supplies to citizens. 
  A report by the SUDAN NEWS AGENCY from Nairobi said the 
Sudanese Embassy there issued a statement in which it held the 
rebel movement was responsible for the failure of the talks that 
were concluded in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, yesterday, and in 
which a government delegation, led by Dr. Ibrahim Abu Awf, 
minister of state at the ministry of social planning, and the 
special envoy of the UN secretary general for humanitarian 
affairs in Khartoum took part. 
  The statement pointed out that the relief talks failed 
because of the insistence of the rebel movement -- Garang's 
group -- on not opening the (Nadus)-Kapoeta-Torit road which 
feeds Kapoeta and Torit areas via the border area of (Nadus) 
from the Kenyan Lokichoggio where there are operation lifeline 
relief depots. The statement added that the Government of Sudan

  [Text] The fourth session of foreign ministers of the 10 
member countries of the Economic Cooperation Organization 
concluded this morning after two days of discussions and 
exchanges of views. 
  According to our correspondent, the deliberations at the 
concluding session lasted 10 hours at the end of which documents 
of cooperation among ECO members in the technical, economic, 
transport, and long-distance communications fields were approved. 
  At the concluding session, the foreign ministers of the 
member countries stressed the need to strengthen the ECO 
Secretariat and to reduce trade tariffs so that member countries 
will pay a tariff of 10 percent rather than 20 percent. The 
participants at the fourth session of the ECO foreign ministers' 
conference named Turkmenistan as the venue for the next ECO 
session. 
  In its final statement, the Tehran session stressed 
expanding 
cooperation in the economic and industrial fields as well as in

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 27, IRNA -- Foreign ministers of the 
10-member Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) in a joint 
communique here Thursday [27 January] reiterated the 
significance of ECO as a regional economic organization which 
can play a major role in the development of the region and in 
raising the standard of living for people in this part of the 
world. 
  The communique was issued at the end of the fourth meeting 
of 
the ECO foreign ministers here Thursday morning. 
  Iran's Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati who currently 
chairs the ECO Council of Ministers, noted that today ECO 
encompasses over 300 million people, more than seven million 
square kilometers and enormous resources. 
  ECO was originally founded by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan. 
Since two years ago it has been joined by Afghanistan, 
Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and 
Uzbekistan. 
  In its communique, the council appreciated 
secretary-general's efforts in establishing relations with 
international organizations and expressed satisfaction over the 
conclusion of agreements for cooperation with those agencies. 
  The ministers urged ECO secretary-general to continue his 
efforts to further develop cooperation with international 
organizations with a view to benefiting from their sources of 
information, experience as well as for projecting ECO as a 
prestigious, forward looking and dynamic international 
organization. 
  The council further welcomed closer cooperation between ECO 
and international organizations and the agreements concluded 
with Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP) and 
the Islamic Development Bank (IDB). 
  The participants also welcomed the signing of memorandums of 
understanding between ECO and the United Nations Children's Fund 
(UNICEF) and United Nations Industrial Development Organization 
(UNIDO) in Tehran during the session. 
  The ECO Council of Ministers also welcomed the results 
reached in the first joint meeting of the ECO health ministers 
with UNICEF and World Health Organization (WHO) and recognized 
the significance of mobilizing the necessary expertise and 
financial resources for the projects in the health sector with 
due attention to the ECO plan of action for safeguarding 
children toward the year 2000. 
  It also reaffirmed the proposal for the reduction of tariffs 
and recommended that joint measures should be made by the member 
states in their fight against the catastrophic consequences of 
natural disasters together with necessary measures for the 
prevention of contagious diseases and their concomitant 
detrimental socio-economic consequences. 
  The council, referring to the availability of the vast 
energy 
resources in the region, emphasized that immediate steps should 
be taken for comprehensive utilization of the resources to the 
benefit of the people of the region. 
  The communique in conclusion reiterated the importance of 
narcotics abuse control and underlined that a comprehensive plan 
for combating the growing menace of drugs should be prepared by 
the year 1995. 
  Senior representatives from UNICEF, UNIDO, ESCAP, IDB, WHO, 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also took part in the meeting 
which was opened by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani last 
Tuesday. 
  On Wednesday, the U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
sent a message to the ministerial session in which he said that 
ECO testified to the strength of the regional organizations of 
the post-Cold War era.

  [Text] The ECO session was concluded in Tehran this morning 
after two days of dicussions. The session's final communique 
shows that the member countries have reached comprehensive 
agreements on various issues. Our correspondent, who attended 
the very lengthy closing session, reports: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] According to the official 
agenda, originally the session was to issue its final communique 
at 1900 yesterday. However, due to existence of different 
points of view expressed by the members, the communique was not 
ratified until 0600 this morning, thus the session was in effect 
extended by 12 hours. 
  We can explain this delay in the light of the speeches made 
earlier by the participants. Later on, each of the speakers 
were seeking to incorporate in the final communique their points 
of view vis-a-vis the overriding national issues in their 
respective countries. A great deal of the session's time was 
thereby taken by this process. Nonetheless, the participants 
seemed satisfied with the debates since they had been able to 
put forward their problems and issues. [passage omitted] 
  In general, however, one's impression of the two-day session 
was that the participants as a whole were satisfied with the 
session's decisions. In my conversations with the participants, 
including Shemshad Ahmad, the ECO secretary general, I learned 
that they were happy with the session's outcome. 
  At the end of the session, I asked Mr. Velayati to remark on 
the outcome of the session, even though he was very tired. 
  [Begin Velayati recording] One of the most important 
decisions adopted in the session was to call the next 10 years 
the decade of communication and transport. In view of the need 
to carry out infrastructural works in order to facilitate 
economic development and pave the way for all-embracing 
cooperation, activities in the areas of communications and 
transport are fundamentally important. The transport ministers 
of ECO member countries recently met in Almaty, and as far as we 
know, ECO members pay special attention to this sphere. It was, 
nonetheless, decided that national projects should be formulated 
and implemented in harmony with ECO's general communications 
plans and projects. This is particularly significant in view of 
the fact that the majority of ECO member countries do not have 
any maritime borders, hence the importance of developing 
communication and transport networks. [passage omitted] [end

President Yasir 'Arafat met a Norwegian delegation led by Torje 
Rod Larsen, director of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry's Middle 
East Department, at his residence in the al-Andalus Palace in

  Palestinian sources said 'Arafat briefed the delegation 
members on efforts to surmount the obstacles hindering the 
implementation of the Jericho-Gaza agreement, including the 
talks in Cairo between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators to 
formulate a plan to implement the accord. 
  Norwegian diplomatic sources said the Norwegian delegation 
that arrived in Cairo last night will stay in the country to 
follow the Palestinian-Israeli talks and will be ready to offer 
any necessary assistance to reach an agreement on how to 
implement the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  Norway played a major role in the secret Palestinian-Israeli 
talks in Oslo, which lasted nine months and led to the signing 
of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on 13 
September.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to the Palestinian president and the head of Palestine's 
delegation to the negotiations with the Israeli team, has said 
he believes progress between the two sides is possible. We will 
resume the negotiations tomorrow, he said. 
  After a seven-hour meeting with the Israeli delegation, he 
added: We hope to achieve results and we will continue the 
negotiations on withdrawal. 
  Sha'th left the hotel at the end of the third round of 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations today to meet Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat at his residence in the al-Andalus 
Palace. 
  In his statement, Sha'th said that throughout the day, the 
two delegations exchanged working papers and are still doing so. 
  It was noted during the seven-hour meeting that a 
Palestinian 
delegation member was in constant touch with 'Arafat. MENA has 
learned that if agreement is reached on the paper of 
understanding on the crossings and Jericho, the Security 
Committee will draft the agreement in its meetings in Taba next 
week. 
  Responsible Palestinian sources told MENA that the Israeli 
delegation still refuses to grant the Palestinian side 
administrative supervision over the religious sites in Jabal 
al-Qarantal and al-Maghtis. The sources added that some 
progress was made on the crossings issue. 
  The Israeli delegation is made up of Uri Savir, director 
general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry; Yo'el Singer, legal 
adviser at the Israeli Foreign Ministry; and Uzi Dayan, 
political planning director at the ministry. 
  The Palestinian delegation consists of Nabil Sha'th, 
Palestine's Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id Kamal, and the head of the 
PLO Economic Department, Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala'. 
  Two Egyptian Foreign Ministry officials and two Norwegian 
Foreign Ministry officials are taking part in the meetings as 
observers outside the conference hall.

<F P=106> [Report by Caroline Faraj] </F>
  [Excerpt] Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordanian ambassador in 
Washington and head of the Jordanian delegation to the bilateral 
peace talks, has described his second-day three-hour talks with 
chief Israeli delegate Elyaqim Rubenstein as good and said they 
constitute a good start. 
  Reached by telephone in Washington, Dr. al-Tarawinah told 
AL-RA'Y: We began to discuss topics on the Jordanian-Israeli 
agenda, delving into some details. The aim is to make sure that 
the Israeli position on them has not changed since 14 September 
1993, the date the agenda was signed. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah added: We also reviewed the points at which 
we stopped in the previous round. The purpose is to prepare for 
the next round of bilateral talks and for the work of the two 
sides' working teams and experts. This, of course, will take 
place only after all the Arab delegations decide to collectively 
participate in the next round. It is natural that the heads of 
delegations are not experts or technicians in all 
specializations. Therefore, we began in this second 
coordination and consultation meeting at the State Department to 
prepare for sub-agendas for the three working groups-- 
environment, water, and energy; refugees and economy; and 
security and borders. He added that these agendas are still 
under discussion and no final agreement regarding them has yet 
been reached. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khudayyir has received 
Jordan's Transport Minister Adib Halasah. Khudayyir observed to 
him that Iraq and Jordan are bound by deep ties of brotherhood. 
Their cooperation in the transportation industry has come a long 
way and will grow deeper still, the prime minister said. 
Khudayyir stated his satisfaction with the status of 
cooperation in transportation between the two brotherly 
countries and Iraq's preparedness to assist Jordan in this and 
other areas. Transportation, he noted, is a significant element 
that must be factored into national development plans. The 
Jordanian minister said he will do all he can to advance 
bilateral cooperation in transportation and to prepare for the 
post-sanctions era, which he predicted will see relations gain 
strength. 
  The meeting was attended by Iraq's Transport and 
Communications Minister Ahmad Murtada Ahmad; Hamid Salih 
al-Rawi, head of the Cabinet secretariat; and the Jordanian 
ambassador in Baghdad.

  [Text] The 27th meetings of the General Assembly and the 
Board of Directors of the Iraqi-Jordanian Overland 
Transportation Company began at the Ministry of Transport and 
Communications today. The session was chaired by Ahmad Murtada 
Ahmad, Iraq's minister of transport and communications. 
Jordan's Transport Minister Adib Halasah attended the meeting. 
  Ahmad Murtada Ahmad underlined the importance of cooperation 
between the two brotherly countries, particularly in the 
transporation area. He commended the Jordanian government and 
people for supporting Iraq as it puts up heroic resistance to 
imperialist and Zionist schemes and for the way it is coping 
with the wicked blockade. 
  The Jordanian minister said the Iraqi government and people 
were conducting themselves heroically in the face of a wicked 
blockade. Iraq, he added, has foiled all imperialist schemes 
designed to hurt the Iraqi people. Keeping the iniquitous 
sanctions in place is legally invalid and [words indistinct], 
the Jordanian minister said.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Jan (INA) -- The Foreign Ministry 
tonight categorically dismissed western and American news media 
allegations of chemicals used in the manufacture of fuels for 
missiles being found aboard a German ship docking in Saudi 
Arabia. Following is the text of the statement: 
  Western and American news media have attributed a statement 
to Dieter Vogel, a German government official, in which he said 
that German intelligence services have had access to information 
from Saudi Arabia to the effect that a search of a German 
freighter, docked at the Port of Jeddah, by Saudi and German 
inspectors on 28 December 1993 turned up two containers 
including hundreds of tonnes of a chemical stuff, used in the 
manufacture of fuels for missiles. 
  The statement added that this ship had transported chemicals 
from China and then unloaded part of its freight in Hong Kong. 
The vessel's travel plan called for it to dock in Cyprus before 
proceeding to Beirut, its final destination. The German official 
then claimed that the chemicals consignment was to have been 
transported from Beirut to Iraq. 
  The Foreign Ministry hereby categorically denies these 
allegations. The fabrication of lies has become a hackneyed 
tactic resorted to by certain quarters known for their hostility 
toward Iraq and the Iraqi people, among them the Saudi regime. 
The idea is to level baseless accusations against Iraq, spread 
lies, and cast doubt with the object of keeping the wicked 
blockade in place. This is because more and more circles and 
nations within and outside the UN Security Council are demanding 
the removal of the blockade. 
  The Foreign Ministry hereby condemns these groundless 
allegations and the role of the guileful Saudi regime in making 
up such lies.

  [Text] Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, chairman of the 
Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI], has 
reaffirmed the need to deploy UN observers in southern Iraq to 
prevent the regime from using heavy weapons against the 
civilians and to supervise the aid programs there. 
  In an interview with the Austrian Broadcasting Company, 
al-Hakim also affirmed the need to send observers and inspection 
teams to investigate conditions inside prisons and detention 
centers, and issues connected with human rights in Iraq. 
  Referring to the deteriorating conditions in the southern 
marshlands that the regime is draining, al-Hakim said returning 
life to normal in these areas has become an urgent need, 
stressing that the United Nations must open gaps in the huge 
earthen dams that the regime has built to cut off water to the 
region. All indications are that these dams are meant to kill 
the people and destroy their livelihood. 
  Al-Hakim stressed that these areas are witnessing tragic 
conditions. The regime has imposed an economic blockade on 
them, preventing food and medical supplies from reaching the 
inhabitants. The regime is also draining the marshlands, forcing 
the inhabitants to emigrate en masse to Iran and to other areas 
in Iraq. 
  Al-Hakim said the regime has not been content with these 
measures. It is also carrying out widespread searches in rural 
towns and villages, and is arresting citizens and torturing them 
to extract confessions on the activists opposed to the tyrant 
Saddam. 
  Answering a question on the goals of the Islamic Resistance 
in southern Iraq, al-Hakim said the Resistance's target is not 
the Iraqi Army because many of the army's personnel do not 
sympathize with the regime. The Resistance is chasing and 
killing the wicked elements who are trying to involve the army 
in the fight. It is also destroying the heavy weapons used by 
the regime to kill civilians.

  [Text] Early this month, Islamic Resistance fighters 
carried out a daring operation against a Ba'th Party official in 
al-Hashimiyah Province in al-Hillah. The heroic mujahidin 
killed the official and seized the car he was driving. 
  The heroic mujahidin also distributed leaflets denouncing 
the 
regime and calling on the Iraqi masses to assist the mujahidin 
in their heroic operations against the regime's mercenaries and 
henchmen. The mujahidin also distributed pictures of martyr 
al-Sadr, the man who triggered the Islamic revolution in Iraq. 
  According to our sources, there is a remarkable decline in 
the Army's morale. Desertions have become frequent in the past 
few days. Army officers have told our sources that they are on 
the side of the masses and only waiting for the appropriate 
moment to prove this. The regime has taken repressive measures 
against Army deserters but the measures have proved futile. 
  Elsewhere, the so-called emergency forces [quwwat 
al-tawari'] 
have been deployed in every governorate. These forces, under 
the pretext of training, have carried out successive sweeps in 
residential areas in various governorates according to a weekly 
timetable. Our sources in the south say that random arrests 
accompany the sweeps and that hundreds of innocent youths have 
been detained. In one incident, the emergency forces demolished 
a house after coming under fire and failing to determine the 
source. The incident occurred in the Nadir al-Thalith district 
of al-Hillah. 
  A kangaroo court of the tyrant's regime has handed down 
sentences of 10-20 years to the remaining detainees who were 
still on trial in connection with the Sha'ban [March 1991] 
uprising. The detainees have been transferred to the notorious 
Abu-Ghurayb Prison. The overwhelming majority of those involved 
in the Sha'ban revolution have been liquidated through mass 
executions or brutal torture.

  [Text] Nicosia, Jan 26 (AFP)--The Iraqi opposition said 
Wednesday it had circulated 50,000 copies of a phony edition of 
the daily newspaper BABIL, owned by President Saddam Husayn's 
son 'Udayy, in Baghdad and other major Iraqi cities. 
  An official of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), which 
groups all the opposition organisations, told AFP that the phony 
papers had been distributed since January 6 and that another 
edition was being prepared. 
  "We imitated the dummy and the lay-out with photos of Saddam 
Husayn and filled the columns with criticism, calls for 
overthrowing the regime and revelations which Iraqis living 
under Saddam's rule are not used to," the opposition official 
said by telephone from Irbil in northern Iraq's autonomous 
Kurdish region. 
  Other INC leaders contacted by telephone in Irbil and London 
said the distribution of the fake BABIL edition was continuing 
despite a campaign by the Iraqi authorities to confiscate all 
the copies. 
  They said another edition was being prepared in Irbil, which 
has been under the control of Iraqi Kurds since 1991, and where 
the INC have a computerized printing-house. 
  "The state television had to issue warnings on January 16, 
calling on the Iraqis to denounce the offenders," a INC official 
said. 
  "We receive all the Iraqi newspapers in the north. The 
citizens living under the control of Baghdad need to be able to 
hear other views than the official literature," he added. 
  He said it would not be difficult for the opposition to 
infiltrate other publications into the country. 
  Iraq's Kurds declared autonomy after expelling Iraqi troops 
from their mountainous region in an uprising which followed 
Baghdad's defeat in the Gulf war early in 1991.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today received the 
Islamic Conference Organisation [ICO] Secretary General Mr. 
Hamid al-Ghabid, who is in Tehran. 
  At the meeting, the president placed emphasis on the role 
and 
significance of the ICO in helping to resolve Islamic countries' 
problems. He said: The world of Islam, with 1.2 billion people 
and various political and economic levers, has a huge power, the 
appropriate and timely utilization of which requires decisions, 
planning, avoidance of side-issues, and attention to the main 
problems among Islamic countries. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed regret at current problems 
which have been imposed on the world of Islam due to 
inappropriate utilization of capabilities and resources in 
Islamic countries and added: Such problems can be solved 
through correct understanding of the world of Islam's sensitive 
current conditions and through coordination and exchange of 
views among planning officials of Islamic countries, as well as 
the targeted and coherent utilization of power levers. 
  The president expressed concern over the continuation of war 
and fratricide in the Islamic country of Afghanistan and pointed 
out: The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly warned leaders 
of the warring sides in Afghanistan about the dire and worrying 
consequences of recent clashes and has called on them to think 
of the interests of the Muslim people, and the reconstruction 
and renovation of Afghanistan before anything else. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani described the continuing genocide in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the heart of so-called civilized Europe as 
a bitter incident which has hurt the feelings of over 1 billion 
Muslims and shamed the indifferent governments which have merely 
watched events. He said: The brave resistance and 
steadfastness of the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina have 
aroused fear and concern among the aggressive Serb forces and 
their western supporters. They are trying to break this 
resistance and force the Muslims to surrender. Therefore, one 
must strengthen the resistance of the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and make the enemies lose hope of achieving 
such a surrender. He continued: The ICO and the free countries 
of the world are also expected to stop the further trampling of 
the rights of the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Pointing out that Islamic countries expect more from the ICO 
in solving the problems of the Islamic world, including the 
problem of Palestine, the president announced the readiness of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran for more cooperation with that 
organization in order to play a more active role in the world of 
Islam. 
  The ICO secretary general briefed the president on the 
current activities and programs of the organization. Speaking 
of the problems of the world of Islam -- Palestine, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Afghanistan, and a number of other Islamic 
countries -- he said: The stances of the ICO are based on the 
establishment of peace and tranquillity and preventing the 
spread of differences, as well as ending them. 
  Pointing to the efforts of the organization in putting an 
end 
to the clashes in Afghanistan, he said: Afghan leaders must be 
convinced to resolve their problems and differences peacefully 
through negotiations. 
  The ICO secretary general expressed regret over the fact 
that 
apart from a limited number of countries among Islamic 
countries, other countries have not given much active support to 
the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He expressed the hope that 
with the active and all-encompassing cooperation of Islamic 
countries, the ICO could play a more active role in resolving 
the problems of the world of Islam.

  [Text] In his speech at the fourth ministerial session of

for the NATO forces to attack the positions of the aggressor 
Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, self-determination for the Kashmiri 
people, a halt to the war in Afghanistan, and the withdrawal of 
Armenian forces from Azerbaijani territory. 
  Hamid al-Ghabid stated that the new world order shapes us 
economically and politically and creates the minimum conditions 
required for a free and amicable existence. He stressed the 
need to broaden economic cooperation among Islamic countries and 
said: Permanent committees have been set up in the fields of 
economics, trade, science, and technology to foster solidarity 
among the member countries.

memorandum of understanding between the ICO and the ECO to 
promote more cooperation among the Islamic peoples. 
  On the sidelines of the ECO ministerial session, Hamid 
al-Ghabid also met Foreign Minister Dr. Velayati and discussed 
the problems of the Islamic world, ways and means to expand and 
boost cooperation among Islamic countries, and cooperation 
between the ECO and ICO as well as other topics of mutual 
interest. 
  At the session, the ICO secretary general said he was 
pleased 
with his talks meeting President Hashemi-Rafsanjani yesterday 
and described his suggestions to strengthen the bases of the ICO 
as extremely valuable and constructive. 
  Dr. Velayati said he hoped the extent of cooperation between 
the ICO and ECO would expand further. Various regional issues

<F P=106> [Editorial: A Step Toward Clearing the Arab Climate"] </F>
  [Text] The visit by Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat to 
Saudi Arabia and his talks with King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz 
represent a positive step toward rebuilding the bridges between 
the PLO and the Gulf states. This, after the deterioration in 
Palestinian-Gulf relations in the aftermath of the second Gulf 
war and the subsequent inter-Arab rifts as a whole. 
  Undoubtedly, any effort toward clearing the Arab climate and 
restoring its harmony and serenity is now more necessary than 
ever. If the Gulf war was a black cloud in the Arab nation's 
history and a negative development in relations between 
brothers, insistence on maintaining that dark and painful 
chapter and keeping the wound of fraternal Arab relations 
bleeding will benefit no one but the adversaries of this nation 
and those who try to exploit differences and crises to achieve 
gains and goals at the expense of all the Arabs. 
  The hope is that Palestinian-Saudi relations in particular, 
and Palestinian-Gulf relations in general, will be elevated to 
their well-known level, even if in stages. Those states were -- 
and it is hoped they will remain in the future -- supporters of 
the Palestinian cause. It is a cause which the Arabs believed 
was above Arab differences and disputes and a reason for unity 
not discord, convergence not divergence. 
  The Palestinian people have proceeded on the road to peace 
and are now passing through a difficult stage in the 
negotiations for implementing the interim agreement. Many 
foreign parties have declared their support for the Palestinian 
people's efforts in building their entity, institutions, and 
infrastructure. The Arab brothers everywhere are called upon to 
play an active role in this sphere. Not only the Palestinians 
but the entire world expects them to do so. 
  Certainly, the supreme Arab interest requires one to forget 
the rancors, sensitivities, and pains and to develop a positive 
pattern of relations between the various Arab states based on 
cooperation and mutual respect. This is what the Palestinian 
cause requires at these delicate circumstances through which it 
is passing. Moreover, this will represent a great achievement 
on the pan-Arab level following the collapse and decline 
witnessed by the Arabs during the past years.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Skulls at Palestinian Embassy in Kuwait"] </F>
  [Text] Arab reconciliation efforts are making tangible 
progress at more than one level. The most distinguished proof 
is Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to the Saudi 
capital and the reception accorded to him at the highest level. 
But it seems that Kuwait -- through its officials -- continues 
to insist on swimming against the tide and working to obstruct 
any Arab rapprochement directly or indirectly in order to 
perpetuate the disputes and splits if possible. 
  Two days ago the Interior Ministry revealed that it had 
found 
weapons and skulls inside the Palestinian embassy in Kuwait 
after fabricating illogical reasons for storming it, violating 
all known diplomatic conventions. 
  We do not know how the Palestinian embassy has turned into 
an 
arsenal of weapons and a warehouse of skulls. Even if these 
skulls do really exist, what is strange about it, given that 
almost every house in Kuwait is armed to the teeth with machine 
guns, rockets, and heavy artillery, as announced by the Interior 
Ministry itself during its combing campaigns designed to seize 
arms after its continued appeal to urge citizens to hand them 
over failed. 
  The presence of a firearm in an Arab embassy is not a 
strange 
or odd thing. It is a rule pursued in most countries, and no 
diplomatic bag lacks arms. The Kuwaiti Government knows there 
is a personal weapon with the ambassador of the state of 
Palestine in Kuwait and elsewhere. It also knows that other 
embassies have weapons, whether before or after the invasion. 
  The question is about the use and purpose of these weapons, 
not about their presence. If these weapons had really been used 
against Kuwait's security and stability, thousands of 
Palestinians would not have been expelled in a humiliating way 
from Kuwait. Nor would Palestinian women have been raped by 
Kuwaitis in broad daylight and in front of their families. 
  One of the main criticisms aimed against the PLO and its 
leaders in a recent Palestine National Council session was its 
failure to distribute arms to the Palestinians living in Kuwait 
to enable them to defend themselves against the storming 
operations conducted by government militias. Its reply was that 
if it had done so, Kuwait would have turned into a blood bath -- 
which it does not want to happen to anyone, neither to Kuwait 
nor to the Palestinians. 
  It is regrettable for Kuwaiti Government officials to speak 
about the existence of skulls in Palestine's embassy and 
announce this serious discovery on the day the Palestinian 
president's visit to Riyadh was due to take place. We do not 
know how these skulls reached the embassy building. If these 
skulls really exist, they are definitely the skulls of innocent 
Palestinians who sought refuge in their country's embassy but 
were later killed by the bullets of the Kuwaitis who had pursued 
them at the height of their spite against anything Palestinian 
-- the spite which dominated Kuwait after the Iraqi forces were 
moved out of it. 
  What is clear is that the Palestinians did not kill a single 
Kuwaiti. Actually they were often the victims. Amnesty 
International reports and television pictures taken by Western 
reporters are full of images of mass graves for the victims 
killed by Kuwaiti government militias. 
  Some Kuwaiti officials are mistaken if they think that by 
these lies they can obstruct Arab reconciliation. They know 
that this reconciliation is not in their interests. They cannot 
obstruct history's movement, nor can they freeze it at a certain 
point. Second, such an approach -- if it continues -- will lead 
to further isolation for Kuwait at the Arab level, and perhaps 
at the Gulf level as well. Proof of this is that some Kuwaiti 
writers have urged that reconciliation should be achieved with 
some of the states which supported Iraq, naming Yemen and 
Tunisia, for example. 
  Kuwait needs a voice of reason to ease the tension with the 
brothers and lead to new pages, which do not all have to be 
positive; it is sufficient for them not to be negative. This is 
because the continuation of hostility is not in the interests of 
Kuwait or its people, whether this hostility is toward the 
Palestinians or anyone else.

  5. Entrenching a multiparty system as a means of 
political organization and expression, and as a framework within 
which power changes hands. 
  6. Respecting public liberties, both individual and 
collective, and promoting and entrenching them in accordance 
with the constitution. 
  7. Respecting the Thamazighth language and promoting it 
as an indivisible part of the national identity alongside Islam 
and pan-Arabism. 
  8. Shunning violence as a means of political expression 
or as a means of arriving at or staying in power. 
  9. Refraining from the use of religion for partisan 
propaganda. 
  10. Refraining from the use of state equipment, official 
establishments, and places of worship for partisan propaganda. 
  The national conference hails the efforts of the National 
Dialogue Commission aimed at bringing the Algerian people 
together in order to overcome the crisis from which the country 
is suffering. All of these efforts have been crowned with the 
timely convening of the national conference on consensus. 
  The national conference calls on the authorities in charge 
of 
administering the transitional period to continue the dialogue 
and to establish it among all the political, economic, and 
social sides in order to achieve civil peace and for the 
recovery of stability, security, and reassurance, to achieve 
economic revival and consolidate the state institutions so as to 
prepare a suitable climate for a return to the electoral process. 
  Thanks to you all and may God bless you. [applause].

  [Text] [Announcer] The national conference of consensus 
concludes this evening at the Palais des Nations after two days 
of proceedings. The final session is under way. More details 
from our correspondents at the Palais des Nations: 
  [Correspondent] Dear listeners everywhere, God's peace and 
mercy be upon you. As you heard, we are now following the final 
session of the national conference of consensus. The main event 
of this session is the report being presented by the rapporteur 
of the committee in charge of drafting the platform of national 
dialogue. One of the most important points of this report thus 
far is that the committee has reached a number of decisions. 
First of all, with regard to the article pertaining to the 
appointment of the presidential body [Article Six], the 
committee kept the version of the original text which stipulates 
that it is the Higher Security Council which appoints the head 
of the presidential body. The latter can appoint one or two 
deputies. The two deputies will assist the head of state in the 
tasks which he entrusts them with. So as I have said, the head 
of state will be appointed by the Higher Security Council. 
  As regards Article 27 pertaining to the Transitional 
National 
Assembly [al-majlis al-watani al-intiqali], the committee in 
charge of drafting the platform proposes to increase the number 
of seats from 180 to 200. These seats will be divided according 
to the following percentages: 15 percent of the seats will be 
reserved for representatives of state bodies, and the remaining 
75 percent will be equally divided among the political parties, 
associations, economic organizations, and other organizations. 
  The installation of the Transitional National Assembly will 
take place three months after the latter has been formed. It 
has also been decided to abolish the board of censorship since 
nothing justifies its existence, the document says. 
  Another article in the document stipulates that the head of 
state can rule by decrees in the period between his appointment 
and the appointment of the transitional national assembly. In 
other words, the period between the two appointments has not 
been fixed. 
  The political resolution says that actions and measures have 
to be taken in order of priority with a view to ending the 
political crisis. This resolution adds that the end of the 
political crisis will inevitably have to go through the 
electoral process, but there are other actions which must be 
undertaken and other conditions which must be met in the 
economic, social, and security fields. The resolution further 
says that the constitution remains in all circumstances the 
legal framework of the transitional period. But, the resolution 
adds, the constitution cannot be implemented in full since, for 
example, it will be impossible to hold elections soon. However, 
emphasis was put on the need to return to the electoral process 
as soon as possible and also on the need to amend some laws 
during the transitional period, such as the electoral code, the 
law on political parties, and the information code. This point 
was in fact included in the original text of the draft platform. 
  [Announcer] Rachid Benhmimid, we give you back the line to 
follow the rest of the statement read out by the rapporteur of 
the committee in charge of drafting the document and also the 
proposals made by the committee to the national conference which 
is meeting at this very moment. These proposals will be put to 
the vote very shortly.

<F P=106> [Report on national conference by unidentified correspondent] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] One of the main points of the 
document endorsed by the national conference is that the head of 
state will be appointed by the Higher Security Council. Let us 
now talk about other important articles in the document that 
still concern the presidential body. 
  Article 8 says that the head of state will be sworn in 
before 
the higher institutions of the nation, in accordance with the 
provisions of Articles 72 and 73 of the Constitution. The head 
of state will have to declare his commitment to devoting himself 
to the implementation of the contents of this document. 
  Article 9 says that the duty of the head of state is 
incompatible with the exercise of any public or private 
functions, even if they were electoral. [sentence as heard] 
This duty is also incompatible with any responsibility within a 
political party or association. 
  The other important article concerns the powers and 
prerogatives of the head of state. These remain almost as they 
appear in the Constitution: He is the supreme commander of all 
the Armed Forces of the republic; he is in charge of national 
defense; he decides and steers the country's foreign policy; he 
chairs the Council of Ministers [the prime minister chairs the 
council of government]; he appoints and dismisses the head of 
government -- this is also a very important point -- he signs 
presidential decrees and appoints people to civilian and 
military posts in the state apparatus, and so on. 
  The other article that has been heavily amended concerns the 
transitional National Assembly. The participants have 
unanimously endorsed these amendments, particularly with regard 
to the membership and number of seats. Thus, the number of 
seats in the transitional National Assembly has been increased 
from 180 to 200. These seats will be divided among the groups 
that had been invited to the national conference of consensus 
according to the following proportions: 15 percent will be 
reserved for representatives of state institutions and the 
remaining 75 percent [as heard] will be equally divided among 
the political parties and the other social forces, including 
associations and economic organizations. The installation of 
the transitional National Assembly will take place within three 
months. I apologize for my mistake: I meant the remaining 85 
percent. 
  [Announcer] There is also the issue of the commitments, 
which 
had appeared in the preliminary documents and which now seem to 
have been changed into "the general policy resolution." 
  [Correspondent] Yes, these commitments, as they had appeared 
in the text of the document, have been incorporated into a 
general policy resolution. Among these commitments, which have 
now appeared in a general policy resolution, the participants 
pledge and call for the preservation and consolidation of 
national unity, by respecting the republican and democratic 
character of the state; respecting the principles of Islam, 
which is the religion of the Algerian state, the pillar of 
society, and the basis of the personality of the Algerian 
people; respecting the Arabic language and promoting it since it 
is the national and official language of the Algerian nation; 
entrenching multiparty politics as a method of organization and 
political expression and a framework for alternating power; 
respecting individual and collective liberties and promoting and 
consecrating these liberties; respecting the Amazighi [Berber 
language and culture] and promoting it since it is an integral 
part of the national identity, alongside Islam and Arabism; 
rejecting violence as a means of political expression or a means 
to come to power or stay in power; refraining from using 
religion for party propaganda purposes; and refraining from 
using state resources, official institutions, and places of 
worship for party purposes. 
  These commitments have remained almost as they were. The 
only change is that they have been removed from the text of the 
document, i.e. the document on national consensus, to be 
incorporated into a general policy resolution. 
  I would like to remind the listeners that the parties that 
boycotted the conference have boycotted it because they have 
declared their readiness to contribute and take part in the 
dialogue which, they are saying, will be starting soon. This 
dialogue is supposed to really start at the beginning of the 
transition period, according to the resolution issued by this 
conference. 
  As regards the parties that initially took part and later 
pulled out, they have said that they will participate in the 
dialogue when it starts. However, in the light of the changes 
introduced to the presidential body, public opinion would like 
to know who the next head of state is going to be. The 
amendment introduced to the presidential body is somewhat an 
indication. But the question remains very important and public 
opinion is waiting for a reply because time is running out and 
the end of the month is near [when the term of office of the 
Higher State Council ends]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Closing speech by Youcef Khatib, chairman of the National </F>
Dialogue Commission, at National Conference in Club des Pins, 
Algiers, on 26 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate: 
Brothers and sisters, here we are now after two days' work 
reaching the end of this national conference. First of all I 
thank all the brothers and sisters for the patriotic spirit they 
have shown and I thank you for enabling this conference to 
approve the platform for national consensus which we consider to 
be in fact a program of action which can be adopted during the 
transitional period. 
  We consider that this platform which has been approved today 
is in reality the result of a collective endeavor in which all 
the quarters which have worked with the National Dialogue 
Commission have participated, regardless of whether they 
participated in the conference, boycotted it, or withdrew from 
it. 
  Since it was set up, the Commission has tried with all its 
force to secure the participation of all parties in the dialogue 
and not to exclude anybody apart from the party which excludes 
itself. Also from the outset, it has endeavored and made all 
efforts to bring views closer, to get everybody to work with all 
sincerity toward implementing the contents of the platform for 
national consensus, and for all to try to give priority to the 
supreme interest of the nation so that Algeria can get out of 
the crisis from which it is suffering as soon as possible. 
  Brothers and sisters, we call on all members of Algerian 
society to show a patriotic spirit and wisdom and place 
Algeria's interest above any other consideration. I will not 
miss the opportunity also to thank all the brothers and sisters 
who have worked assiduously in preparing this conference. 
  May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. 
[applause] 
  I officially announce the end of the conference. [National 
anthem played]

<F P=106> [Interview with Higher State Council Chairman Ali Kafi by </F>
Hasan Zaytuni in Algiers; date not given; from the 
"Face-to-Face" program] 
  [Text] [Zaytuni] Mr. Chairman Ali Kafi, welcome to the MBC 
television center. We thank you for agreeing to give this 
interview which, as you know, coincides with Algeria's and the 
Algerians' preparations for the national conference on dialogue 
to find a way out of Algeria's crisis. Mr. Chairman, can you 
talk about the hopes that the Algerian leadership is pinning on 
this conference? 
  [Kafi] Thank you. First, I in my turn thank the MBC for this 
interest in Algeria and its problems. Thank you. Regarding 
your question, I and everyone who follows up on the developments 
in Algeria believe that a qualitative change could have happened 
had this crisis not taken place. Viewers and all those who 
watch your programs should be given the full picture of Algeria 
before the present stage, that is, from 1962 until 1988 when a 
popular uprising took place that filled the streets all over 
Algeria. The leadership at the time came to the conclusion that 
it was necessary to review the Constitution. Political 
pluralism was approved because it was one party rule. From that 
time on, Algeria began to deal with this new concept of 
organizing the political and social life of the country. 
Parties began to be established very quickly and 62 or 63 
parties were set up. Between 1989 and December 1991, 
legislative elections were organized. I believe that this was 
not enough time. That's one point. Second, the parties did not 
organize themselves. The administration was still fragile and 
could not act as it should in organizing the elections and we 
saw what happened following the 26 December elections. 
  When the results of the elections were announced, they were 
contested and were met with strong rejection. So there was a 
need for change. The Parliament had ended its term and the 
president of the Republic resigned. There was a vacuum. 
Naturally, we decided that the state should continue. So we 
formed the Higher State Council under the late brother Mohamed 
Boudiaf, may God have mercy on his soul. We drew up a plan to 
extricate the country from its crisis as quickly as possible. 
The task entrusted to the Higher State Council was to carry out 
the duties for the remaining two years of the five-year term of 
the president. The Higher State Council was formed under 
Boudiaf, who, after six months in power, was assassinated, as 
you know. I was chosen to replace him. I assumed power and we 
began our work to address the situation because we found out 
that the three pillars on which the state was built were in a 
state of collapse. We found that the state was in a shambles, 
the economy was collapsing, and that Algerian society was in 
total disarray from lack of confidence resulting from the 
accumulation of previous mistakes. 
  [Zaytuni] Mr. President, regarding the idea of dialogue, 
certain parties, particularly the National Liberation Front 
[FLN] and the Socialist Forces Front, have boycotted the 
National Conference. Will this boycott affect the results of 
the conference or will it continue, even if these parties and 
others fail to participate? 
  [Kafi] Before answering this question directly, I would like 
to say that in September 1992 we endorsed the policy of dialogue 
with all political parties, economic and social partners, and 
other confederal committees concerned with these tasks, such as 
the Mojahedin Organization, the Martyrs' Sons Organization, and 
the Farmers Union, etc. These are large, important pillars in 
the country. 
  We adopted the policy of dialogue and embarked on a first 
round, a second, and a third round from which we emerged with 
the document in June 1993, a document called the basis for 
national dialogue. All the parties responded. We prepared a 
complete file on what took place at these stages of dialogue and 
based on these replies and this basis. Then we heard and sensed 
from some statements by various parties that we should negotiate 
or have a dialogue with the army, and so on. We decided in the 
end that we should give another stimulus to the dialogue. Thus, 
we formed a national committee to be in charge of completing the 
dialogue in light of what took place in the previous rounds, and 
of the parties' replies. This began in September 1993 and has 
continued to this day, until after tomorrow, that is, Tuesday 25 
January and 26 January, when the conference is slated to be held. 
  Regarding the second part of the question about the fronts, 
or the so-called three fronts, that is, the FIS [Islamic 
Salvation Front], the FLN, and the Socialist Front of Ayet 
Ahmed. Before going into this, we have to mention that on 23 
November 1993, the Higher Council decided that there must be a 
dialogue with Islamic figures [al-hasasiyat al-islamiyah] and 
the dialogue committee did in fact began contacts with the 
Islamic figures, both those outside and inside the detention 
camps. That is premature now [sentence as heard]. But with 
regard to the FLN and the Socialist Front, it appears that these 
fronts had concluded a power-sharing agreement before the 
December elections. Therefore, we see now that they do not want 
to participate in the dialogue, in the national conference, 
because they appear to already have an agreement and want to put 
the authority in a tight situation. 
  As chairman of the Higher State Council, I personally wish 
and hope that they return to reason because the issue is not one 
of maneuvers at present. It is the issue of crisis. We did not 
hide this fact and said that it is a political crisis that has 
to be dealt with politically, that political solutions must be 
found for it, and that it is our hope to save the country from 
this crisis once and for all so that it will not recur after 
two, five, or 10 years. Therefore, when we opted for dialogue 
with all the partners, it was not a [word indistinct] but a 
strategic one. The objective is: first, to end the crisis in 
the country; second, to get the parties used to discussing with 
each other the country's affairs through dialogue and not 
through violence. Somebody might say that if these fronts do 
not attend the conference, then the dialogue would not have the 
desired importance. I reply that public opinion will be the 
judge. Are these fronts present in the field and do they 
control it or not? I say that Algerian society comprises a 
large number of parties and organizations and it is watching 
these parties' conduct and these parties' losses will be great 
because public opinion and history will judge them. That is why 
I hope that they will not place themselves before the court of 
history. 
  [Zaytuni] Let us turn to the expression political families, 
which you mentioned in your speech yesterday. I very much liked 
the phrase because it reflects the nature of Algerian society, 
whose ethics reject violence and unethical practices, whether 
those carried out by some quarters in the Algerian streets such 
as political assassinations or by the authority's official stand 
vis-a-vis these quarters, such as the arrests at the detention 
camps in the desert. All these acts, be they torture or 
assassinations, do not conform to the ethics of Algerian 
society. The phrase political families reflects your position 
regarding party plurality in Algeria. You welcome pluralism, 
provided it serves the country. 
  [Kafi] This is a many-sided question. I mentioned the phrase 
political families at a meeting with strugglers yesterday. We 
said let us meet with all parties that have similar views so 
that we can seek real solutions for getting the country out of 
the crisis. Thus, we extended....[sentence incomplete as 
heard]. I talked about this yesterday. Before we started the 
dialogue, the parties themselves were alienated from each other 
and were not in the habit of sitting down together to discuss 
national issues in a rational, calm, and methodical manner. So 
we got them used to sitting down together, and this is what I 
referred to yesterday as a major gain, because such alienation 
does not allow us to reach the desired solutions. So, when the 
parties got together, talked together, and exchanged opinions 
and counter opinions, this is the essence of democracy. We must 
sit down together and exchange views. Before, people used to 
hear about each other's views and each party refused the other's 
views. But when we meet, we may find something in common, 
particularly if your goal and mine regarding the national cause 
is sincere. This is what is talked about. As for the 
phenomenon of violence, it is true that it is alien to us. It 
does not belong to the Algerian society, nor does it belong to 
the Arab Maghreb community, as you know. This phenomenon is 
alien to our society, as I have previously mentioned in several 
speeches and even in my dialogue with the partners. This in 
fact is what is described as the Afghan phenomenon. In brief, 
in the 1948 war the Algerians went on foot to Palestine, where 
they saw the war there. When they heard about the Afghan people 
and watched the Jamal al-Din al-Afghani [19 Century political 
struggler in Egypt of Afghan origin] series on television -- as 
you know Algerians follow the news of great men in the Arab and 
Islamic worlds -- they went and volunteered. They [not further 
specified] picked them up from several areas -- some went to 
London and several other areas. After that, they all met in 
Peshawar, where they received advanced military training and 
joined the battle alongside the Afghan mojahedin against 
communism, at that time. When the communist bloc and the Soviet 
Union collapsed and the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan, 
the people who were supervising these groups let them go. Each 
one went his own way and started wreaking havoc in the world. 
Some of these groups are present here in Algeria. [Words 
indistinct] in Afghanistan and took part in the war in 
Afghanistan. Now, it is wreaking havoc here in Algeria, 
something which is truly alien to our society, our traditions, 
our upbringing, and the makeup of Algerian society. Thus, we 
believe that is an alien phenomenon. 
  [Zaytuni] There is one point, Mr. Chairman. The people who 
have practiced and have chosen violence justify this by 
referring to the suspension of what is termed the election 
process and say that they had won the elections but the 
authorities prevented them from taking over. They have an 
argument with which to justify their actions. How do you view 
this argument? 
  [Kafi] I do not talk about arguments. A person involved in 
politics has to behave politically. Violence must be rejected. 
They can attain power but not through violence. It is wrong 
for anyone to use violence because the election process was 
halted. It is wrong because, as I said before, one can contest 
the results. The elections were neither honest nor clean and 
the administration was weak and could not manage the elections 
and their process. But this cannot be used as an excuse to 
carry weapons against the society to which one belongs. 
Therefore, those who want to attain power -- and every party 
has this ambition to attain power.... [changes thought] But 
does one attain power with a program or with a gun? If with a 
program, then all the people and public opinion will be the 
judge. But with a gun, the people and public opinion could go 
along with you out of fear and not out of conviction. This 
argument is wrong. The dialogue within Algerian society, within 
the political family, must be political and calm. 
  [Zaytuni] Mr. Chairman, let us leave the Algerian crisis 
after this superb analysis and touch on Algeria's foreign 
relations. Algeria will take over the chairmanship of the Arab 
Maghreb Union [AMU] at the beginning of next month. What issues 
or aspects will Algeria focus on achieving as chairman of this 
union, which appears to be suffering from some sort of 
stagnation? 
  [Kafi] To say that the AMU is suffering from stagnation is 
correct. We wanted to deal with this situation and activate the 
member countries' dealings, both collectively and bilaterally, 
at the summit held in Nouakchott, Mauritania. But the number of 
those who attended it was insufficient. Morocco was represented 
by the prime minister and Libya by an ambassador. That was a 
summit. If we want to give substance to this union, then 
attendance must be at the required level. There are also some 
problems that could at present be an obstacle to progress and to 
what our peoples want from this union. 
  The AMU must be moved to the position it deserves because 
all 
the other partners are waiting for this. When we draw a clearly 
defined strategy, then we would most certainly find a response 
and a desire for cooperation from others on an equal footing. 
But if each one continues to act unilaterally and uses the AMU 
just as a cover or an excuse but refrains from moving forward 
with it, then we would most certainly not attain the desired 
objective. Algeria is convinced of the collective action of the 
Arab Maghreb. The Algerian people, government, and 
establishments are convinced of this. We believe that the AMU 
is needed to strengthen the domestic situation in each country 
and to strengthen this union with these immense human, 
scientific, cultural, and economic strengths. There must be 
serious planning for this process. We cannot tolerate such a 
situation because of transient conditions that shake it and 
render it stagnant. 
  Algeria believes in this union and we hope that when it 
takes 
over the chairmanship it will work seriously with all the 
comrades to ensure the success of the union. 
  [Zaytuni] As a result of the rift in inter-Arab relations 
following the Gulf war, there are attempts to achieve inter-Arab 
reconciliation. What is Algeria's position on this issue? 
  [Kafi] Although my meetings with Arab officials are few, 
because of the circumstances in Algeria and the fact that I do 
not leave the country much, I did meet with many Arab brothers 
at various levels, such as the Tunisian president and Egyptian 
President Brother Husni Mubarak in June and we touched on this 
issue. I even discussed this matter very frankly with Egyptian 
intellectuals during a seminar. We believe that the Gulf war 
happened and we should not say now who was wrong and who was 
right. It is something that happened in the past and caused a 
deep and wide rift among the Arab peoples and countries. We 
should go beyond this. Inter-Arab reconciliation is necessary 
if we are to place supreme Arab interests before other 
considerations. This is because the purpose of reconciliation 
is to close ranks, strengthen the negotiating power with the 
others, and bolster and deepen respect for the Arab world by 
others, particularly since we are going through a qualitative 
and unipolar world transitional period. All these factors make 
it incumbent upon us to get together and reconcile, because our 
interest lies in getting together. For us in Algeria, the Arab 
and Islamic world provides depth for us, and Algeria provides 
depth for the Arab and Islamic world. The same is true for us 
and Africa. All this should make us draft a well-defined 
strategy for reconciliation. Each of the parties concerned 
could make a concession so long as the ultimate objective is to 
serve the supreme interests of the Arab nation. 
  [Zaytuni] Another issue in which Algeria has always played a 
pioneering role concerns Arab-Israeli peace as well as the 
Arab-Israeli conflict, which still exists. There are 
initiatives toward achieving some kind of peace between Israel 
and the Arab countries. How does Algeria view these current 
initiatives as well as the peace process in general? 
  [Kafi] Algeria has a clear-cut policy regarding this issue. 
This issue has two dimensions. The first concerns the land 
occupied by Israel during the 1967 war which is claimed by its 
owners. Egypt regained its land. Syria is now negotiating to 
regain its land. Our position on this is that we always side 
with our brothers. We took part in the 1967 and 1973 wars 
alongside our brothers in Egypt. The second dimension concerns 
the Palestinians. Algeria has made its opinion clear to the PLO 
and to Palestinian President Brother Yasir 'Arafat when he 
talked to us before going to Washington to sign the agreement. 
He came here (?25) days before the agreement and told us. We 
do not want to be more Palestinian than the Palestinians. We 
support the Palestinians in whatever they chooses for 
themselves. However, we gave them our opinion, which is the 
essence of our experience from the liberation war. Thus, 
Algeria is involved in current Arab issues, whether through the 
Arab League or bilateral contacts, and is also concerned with 
regard to the Palestinians. However, it cannot help but back 
the opinion of the Palestinian officials as far as these issues 
are concerned. 
  [Zaytuni] The last question, Mr. President, concerns you as 
president of the Republic. You assumed power under difficult 
security circumstances following the assassination of late 
President Mohamed Boudiaf, may God have mercy on his soul. 
Would you tell us about the most important decision you have 
made or position you have adopted during your term in office in 
the past two years? 
  [Kafi] In fact, There are a number of actions and, 
occasionally, decisions that I made. I believe that settling 
the border issue between Algeria and Tunisia once and for all is 
one of the most important achievements. This is an example for 
any country that has border disputes. In addition, as you know, 
the Algerian economy was in a shambles. We made decisions to 
address it. We decided to adopt a market economy. We replaced 
a guided economy with a free economy. However, this system is 
being implemented step by step because we had grown accustomed 
to a certain course of action and now we have moved to another. 
We expected reactions or shakeups and were prepared to address 
them, particularly social upheavals that concern us very much. 
Dialogue was not part of our behavior and so we decided to 
pursue a policy of continuing dialogue in Algerian society. 
This is a civilized landmark which, if we continue and meet 
with success, God willing, it will be a pioneering experiment. 
  [Zaytuni] Thank you very much, Mr. President. We wish you 
and Algeria success.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rabeh Kebir, official spokesman of the </F>
Algerian Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], by Qusayy Salih 
al-Darwish in Cologne on 24 January] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Darwish] How do you assess the current 
situation in Algeria? 
  [Kebir] The situation in Algeria today is really tragic 
because, as everyone knows, the Algerian people had elected 
their representatives and chosen their political program with 
complete freedom, the people agreed on their chosen 
representatives and moved toward forming a government to their 
liking after three years of paralysis, but regrettably a group 
of army commanders, generals, took an unsound course and 
repressed the people. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] What about the contacts made by the government 
with the FIS leaders? 
  [Kebir] The contacts made with the FIS leaders here and 
there, such as the contact we heard was made with Shaykh Abbasi 
Madani and other shaykhs, were, we have been informed, 
conditional. As if one would say I choose the people I want to 
talk to and on my own terms, and if they accept my terms and 
agree to do a number of things then I would hold a dialogue, 
etcetera. This attitude, of course, shows the regime's lack of 
seriousness. It also shows that the aim of bringing the parties 
together is to gain some credibility, strike at the people's 
resistance, and portray the newborn body that will succeed the 
Higher State Council as an acceptable one born out of 
reconciliation, and so on. The result of these unserious 
contacts is certainly rejection because the FIS leadership, 
whether at home or abroad, cannot accept such a thing and would 
not lend credibility to those people just because they held 
contacts and made attempts which clearly have the objective of 
maintaining the same domineering power. 
  [Al-Darwish] It has recently been reported that the FIS 
leaders have selected four of them to meet with the Dialogue 
Committee, hear its offers, and convey the FIS' views. Can you 
confirm or deny these reports? 
  [Kebir] As far as we are concerned these reports are not 
true and have not been confirmed. I believe that you have read 
Shaykh Ali Balhadj's message to the Dialogue Committee. 
  [Al-Darwish] But that was an old message which he wrote last 
November when he was in Tizi Ouzou prison. 
  [Kebir] That is true but it covered matters of principle. 
One cannot play games with such issues as the national dialogue 
or change his mind so easily. At any rate, so long as we hear 
nothing on that from our own sources, the report is untrue until 
the opposite is proven. What I can confirm is that the FIS 
leaders would never forfeit the Algerian people's rights. 
  [Al-Darwish] Is there any possibility of the FIS 
participating in the national conference directly or indirectly 
when it convenes tomorrow (Tuesday 25 Jan)? 
  [Kebir] I believe the FIS is not concerned with the 
conference in any way. I believe that such a dialogue on the 
regime's terms is a waste of time. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] Even if the dialogue is not as serious as you 
would like it to be, it has actually materialized on the ground 
and in the minds of the politicians. Most parties demand it as 
the only way out of the crisis, not to mention that many within 
the regime have adopted the idea. But you, and you personally 
in particular, have set extremely difficult conditions for 
dialogue with the regime. Do you believe that such 
intransigence will help end the Algerian crisis? 
  [Kebir] As far as I am concerned, the conditions were 
logical and were required legally and reasonably. It is not just 
a question of of the extraordinary courts set up illegally and 
unconstitionally nor a question of the creation of 
unconstitutional bodies. It has gone beyond that to mass murder 
without trial. For instance, over the past weeks in eastern 
Algeria, prisoners were taken handcuffed out of prison in trucks 
to a jungle near the town of el-Kelaa and, with people looking 
on, they were killed. This incident is known even to the 
national press. Such actions and their timing reflect the real 
views and ideas of the authorities. I cannot sit around the 
same table with those who kill the people. I say it frankly, 
they must be brought to justice with all the guarantees of 
justice. 
  [Al-Darwish] But that means that you are not setting 
coniditions but rejecting dialogue altogether. With whom is the 
dialogue to be held? With those currently in authority, 
naturally. If you are requesting dismissal and trial as a 
precondition, it means that you completely reject the principle 
of dialogue with the authorities? 
  [Kebir] No, that is not the case. We are not saying that 
everyone in authority has committed such criminal acts. Those 
who did commit and order these acts are known. They are a group 
of generals not exceeding a handful. They are the ones who 
should be brought to justice. 
  [Al-Darwish] You are talking as if you assume that there is 
an authority in Algeria other than the military authority and 
that it can bring the military command to trial. You know that 
everyone sees the current conflict in Algeria as a conflict 
between two powers: the Army and the FIS. When we talk about a 
dialogue to resolve Algeria's current crisis resulting from that 
conflict, we are in fact talking about a dialogue between the 
FIS and Army leaders. 
  [Kebir] I say that the Army should get rid of some criminal 
commanders and choose for itself some good men. 
  [Al-Darwish] Permit me to say once more that what you are 
saying means that you actually reject dialogue with the current 
authorities. 
  [Kebir] We reject dialogue with those who committed crimes 
against the people. 
  [Al-Darwish] So, according to you, the resolution of 
Algeria's current dangerous situation depends on the outcome of 
the armed confrontation? 
  [Kebir] The armed confrontation is not an end in itself. It 
has come to rid the country of the injustice that has occurred. 
  [Al-Darwish] But do you believe that the armed clash with 
the regime launched by the Islamic armed movement or other 
Islamic organizations can really bring the regime down? 
  [Kebir] I do not believe that military action can quickly 
and decisively settle the issue in favor of one side or the 
other, but resistance against injustice will unltimately lead to 
change within the existing ruling authority itself. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] There are clear differences in the tones, 
arguments, and positions of the members of the Executive 
Committee abroad. I remind you, for instance, of the difference 
between your statement and Sahraoui's statement on the 
assassination of foreigners in Algeria. 
  [Kebir] When I talk I do so as FIS official spokesman and as 
the official in charge of the Executive Committee abroad. When 
others speak they give their own views and analysis. There is 
nothing wrong with having differences of opinion in one way or 
another within the context of general FIS policy. 
  [Al-Darwish] Did you form the Executive Committee abroad on 
your own initiative, the five of you, or on the basis of a 
decision by the FIS leadership at home? 
  [Kebir] It was a decision by the FIS, all of it. 
  [Al-Darwish] Are you really in contact with a legitimate 
organized leadership at home, one that meets and decides 
everything? 
  [Kebir] Certainly, there is coordination between the FIS 
leaderships at home and abroad. That coordination may increase 
or decrease according to circumstances but it is always there. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] At various stages since its foundation, the FIS 
has assumed that the Algerian Army would not contribute to the 
confrontation with it and that it would be divided within itself 
if it did join in that confrontation, but the Algerian Army is 
still noticeably the regime's only cohesive institution. 
  [Kebir] I believe that the forces used by the regime now 
do not really represent the Algerian Army in its popular 
dimension as we know it. They use specially brainwashed forces. 
I believe that some time is required before we can see the real 
results. If the Army continues to be used widely and 
extensively, we will see the results later on. There have been 
some results already. How many Army personnel have deserted and 
joined the mujahidin? 
  [Al-Darwish] Do you have a numerical estimate of the Army 
deserters? 
  [Kebir] It is difficult to give estimates but it is now 
widespread in all sectors of the country. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] Many observers do not understand your silent 
appeasement of the "Armed Islamic Groups" which have been 
fiercely attacking you and the FIS in their statements. 
  [Kebir] Regarding the statements issued by some criticizing 
the FIS, its program, or its men, it is impossible to verify or 
authenticate them because they are not signed by a known person. 
Who issues these statements? Who is he and what does he 
represent? So the possibility remains that the security 
authorities might be behind them. What we know is that the 
official leaderships of these groups inside Algeria do not adopt 
such positions. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] The Western media insists that the FIS has 
links with some Islamic states or receives various aid from 
them. The names of Iran, Sudan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan were 
mentioned. What aid and facilities does the FIS get from these 
states? 
  [Kebir] That claim is unfounded. We have said so 
frequently. It is as if those making such claims want to cast 
doubt on the Algerian people's support for the FIS. By God, I 
believe that a cause upheld by the people does not need aid from 
other states. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Darwish] If the FIS' historical leaders, who are in 
prison, agreed on a dialogue with the regime, do you believe 
that they would be able to impose the idea of a dialogue and its 
possible consequences on the armed movements and on the FIS' 
current secret leadership structures? 
  [Kebir] What is certain is that the historical leadership of 
the FIS consisting of Shaykh Abbasi Madani and Shaykh Ali 
Balhadj is the real leadership of the FIS and is considered so 
by all of the FIS's groups and frameworks. The positions they 
take, therefore, are respected but that leadership knows that 
the sacrifices it made were made in rejection of injustice. I 
therefore believe that its position would be in line with the 
aspirations of the Algerian people. 
  [Al-Darwish] In other words, it would not accept the 
dialogue idea? 
  [Kebir] It cannot possibly accept a dialogue that would mean 
forfeiting the Algerian people's rights and overlooking the 
blood that has been spilled 
  [Al-Darwish] What do you think of the appointment of 
Abdelaziz Boutaflika as head of state? 
  [Kebir] Has he been appointed? 
  [Al-Darwish] It has been reported that he is on his way to 
being appointed. 
  [Kebir] As I have already said, the country's crisis was 
caused in particular by a group of generals. When the necessary 
conditions securing the Algerian people and their rights 
prevail, then we will be able to express an opinion. 
  [Al-Darwish] What is your personal opinion of and position 
regarding Boutaflika? 
  [Kebir] The problem in Algeria is now more than just a 
problem of individuals. Furthermore, what would the appointment 
of one individual mean if based on unsound foundations?

  [Text] Athens, Jan. 27, IRNA -- The Islamic Salvation Front 
(FIS) has firmly denied reports saying that some FIS leaders 
were ready to participate in Algeria's national conference. 
  "FIS firmly denies what has been reported that some shuyukh 
(Islamic leaders) may perhaps represent the front in what is 
called the national conference and reaffirms that this 
conference is doomed to failure," said a FIS press release faxed 
to IRNA Wednesday [26 Jan] night. 
  The 2-day national conference ended Wednesday without 
reaching any decision on the political future of Algeria. The 
military-backed regime said the conference will convene to try 
to resolve the crisis. 
  The statement in Arabic, signed by FIS' exiled spokesman in 
Europe, Rabah Kebir, said the contacts between the regime and 
the jailed shuyukh were merely "discussions" and not a 
"dialogue", and he accused the military-backed regime of 
falsifying the facts. 
  Kebir, who lives in Germany, reiterated that FIS will not 
participate in any conference before all political prisoners are 
set free and their political freedom re-established. Most 
opposition parties boycotted the conference. 
  The statement said FIS leader Shaykh Ali Belhadj, who began 
a 
hunger strike on December 4, was admitted to a military hospital 
in an unconscious state after 22 days. 
  After undergoing medical treatment for five days Belhadj was 
transferred to the military jail in Balida. 
  The FIS won a sweeping victory in the first-round in 
Algeria's first multi-party elections at the end of 1991, but 
the military-backed authorites scrapped the poll, banned the FIS 
and arrested thousands of Islamists. 
  The regime last week released hundreds of Islamists, but FIS 
said amnesty was not enough to justify opening a dialogue with 
the regime.

  [Text] Rabat, Jan. 26 (MAP) -- "We will give 
decentralization a new meaning and the authority will no longer 
be concentrated in a given place but will be fairly divided 
throughout the Kingdom", King Hassan II said here Tuesday [25 
Jan]. 
  In an address he made after appointing new walis and 
governors in various wilayas, prefectures and provinces of 
Morocco and new governors at the central administration of the 
Ministry of State to the Interior, the sovereign underlined that 
the ministries will be accountable before the municipal and 
rural councils, as well as before the parliament in case of a 
delay in implementing projects. 
  "We have set up a committee gathering representatives of all 
central services, including engineers, physicians, teachers, 
farming engineers, magistrates and all the representatives of 
the administrative apparatus of the state", the sovereign added. 
  This committee will meet once a week to examine with the 
walis and governors all the topics submitted and to monitor the 
projects underway with a view to implementing them in the best 
conditions.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by King Husayn to the Council on Foreign </F>
Relations in Washington on 25 January -- recorded; in English] 
  [Text] Mr. (Frye), I would like to thank you most warmly 
and sincerely for the kind invitation for me to address the 
Council on Foreign Relations. Mrs. Graham, your warm welcome is 
deeply felt by myself, Nur, and all members of my Jordanian 
delegation, here with us this evening. 
  It is indeed a privilege and a pleasure for me to stand here 
before you at this most interesting of times, a time of hope, a 
time of challenge, and, obviously, a time of danger. And as I 
look around in this hall -- the years have forced me to wear 
glasses -- but nonetheless I can easily recognize and see many 
dear friends I have got the privilege of knowing over the years. 
I have equally shared with many of you the hopes that we would 
see progress in our region. It was a very dear objective, the 
establishment of a just, durable, and lasting peace. 
  Years have passed and we have had the privilege and the joy 
of preaching peace, the kind of peace that future generations 
can live with, can accept, can enjoy. I hope that we will leave 
them this legacy, a legacy to the children of Abraham for all 
times to come to live in a region and, hopefully, contribute 
toward a better future for mankind, a region that has been a 
beacon, that has contributed much to the progress of mankind 
throughout its history and on many levels. 
  I feel that much has happened, and much ground has been 
covered, and there is, obviously, much more that needs to be 
done. Briefly, since our participation in formulating Security 
Council Resolution 242 in 1967, we sought a comprehensive peace, 
and since the adoption of that resolution, we assumed our 
responsibilities toward our people and others in the region. 
With courage and commitment to the cause of their future, we 
tried over many years to see the implementation of the said 
resolution. In 1974, at an Arab summit in Rabat in Morocco and 
in response to a Palestinian demand and an Arab demand we 
recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the 
people of Palestine, and we have adhered to our word and our 
commitment throughout the years and until now. The Cold War 
affected our region. Shortsighted policies afflicted the region 
and caused many tragedies. The unresolved Arab-Israeli problem 
has been the root cause of instability in that region that has 
been the ladder that has paved the way for many to seek power, 
not always wisely, and not always in total dedication to the 
cause of people and their future. 
  The solution of this problem will bring to all in the 
region the chance and opportunity to live a life that that has 
been denied them for far too long -- a life that is their right. 
In the years since '74 we tried every way possible to achieve 
progress towards peace. Finally we disengaged legally and 
administratively with the occupied West Bank and this paved the 
way for the PLO's acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 
and 338. 
  We all lived through the tremendous changes that have 
occurred in our world in recent times, and with them the growing 
feeling in our region by those who look beyond today to tomorrow 
and to years from now, long after we are no more. In the 
interest of people, an interest has grown and manifested itself 
in responsible action hopefully aimed at the establishment of 
peace. We went to Madrid and we did so after holding a national 
conference in Jordan and looking at all the options. We went to 
Madrid supported by the Jordanian people in terms of those 
commitments to the establishment of peace. We went to Madrid 
creating the opportunity for our Palestinian brothers to go 
under an umbrella that has since been pulled down and relegated 
to a closet of history to provide also the opportunity for the 
Palestinians to speak for themselves regarding their cause on 
their land and regarding their future, and beyond Madrid, 
Moscow, the multilaterals and Washington, and the 13th of 
September of last year was a day that will be remembered for 
many many years to come. For, at last, in this capital of the 
United States of America, Palestinians and Israelis recognized 
each other and began the process towards resolving their 
differences based on 242 and 338 that called for negotiations 
amongst the parties. 
  The handshakes that were witnessed by the world were indeed 
of tremendous significance and importance, and I believe they 
tore down many walls and many obstacles in the case of progress 
towards the attainment of peace. That was September the 13th. 
September the 14th, Jordan ratified the agenda that it had 
worked out with the Government of Israel relating to the 
subjects that have to be covered and dealt with and resolved, 
culminating in the establishment of peace. We did so shortly 
after the event that took place the day before because we were 
consistent since 1974 recognizing the Palestinians' right and 
the PLO's right to represent them regarding their fate and their 
future and their cause on their national soil. 
  Although it took us by surprise, we could not but be true 
to ourselves, and therefore, we also recognized the fact that 
what took place on that date was an act of great wisdom and 
great courage on both sides. And in support of it, we could 
have moved before, but we did not because we wanted to see 
progress on the Palestinian track with Israel. 
  What is the future? We are just about starting another round 
of talks here in Washington, and I hope that it will produce 
tangible results. We started from the same point in Madrid. We 
in Jordan have always supported Palestinians regarding their 
rights on their soil. Finally, they acted on their own. They 
will continue to have our full support in any way that we can 
provide for the needs of the times ahead. We and the 
Palestinians, the Syrians, the Lebanese all started at the same 
point. And I believe in the very recent past a very important 
development was the meeting that took place a short while ago in 
Switzerland between President Clinton and President Hafiz 
al-Asad of Syria. I have known President al-Asad over many many 
years, and I firmly believe that there is a conviction amongst 
very many that he is a man of his word. 
  My feeling in the recent past and now is one of hope, not 
only hope, but hope substantiated by reasons of contact and 
coordination to the best of our abilities with all the other 
parties involved in this conflict, and in particular Syria. I 
believe that what we will see in the immediate future is rapid 
progress, hopefully in addressing all the problems on all the 
tracks. 
  A question is asked by some: What of Jordan? Jordan 
believes and strives for a comprehensive peace in the region. 
But in terms of the facts, Jordan is now engaged in addressing 
all the items, all the subjects, that will be the core of the 
efforts, hopefully, of Jordan and Israel to try to resolve, and 
that formulated or formed the joint agenda. Some have suggested 
that I should on this visit, at a meeting with a top Israeli 
official, ratify a peace treaty. My feeling is that a peace 
treaty is the crowning achievement, and must be, of resolving 
all the different problems that are there. And I hope that 
rapid progress will be made to enable us to reach that point 
before long. I hope that we will see progress on all the other 
tracks as well. But we are, hopefully, the masters of our own 
destiny, and let me be very clear and unequivocal in stating 
before you, before the skeptics, that our final goal is a peace 
treaty with Israel, if we can resolve, and when we can resolve, 
all the problems that we are now addressing in the negotiations 
that are beginning, and hopefully, will be ongoing. 
  We have said also that we would be more than happy to see 
implementation of whatever we agree upon, not to wait till the 
end. We have a feeling that we have to sensitize people on both 
sides to what peace means, to the change that is occurring. 
Jordanian territories must return to Jordanian sovereignty. But 
once that happens and in a context of peace, we can look at the 
entire rift valley as an economic unit and one of promise for 
all in terms of the potential to develop the resources and 
benefit from them to the largest possible extent by all 
concerned. Another area is water. That is important to us all. 
And we must work out a way satisfactory to all in terms of the 
fairness of the distribution of what is available, and I believe 
that what is available is not enough for all the needs of people 
before too long in our region. But in the context of peace other 
sources can be harnessed and the needs of people can be 
addressed. 
  And obviously an area which is very, very important is that 
of the human dimension of the problem. We feel that it is of 
utmost importance that people in the occupied territories should 
receive the greatest possible attention and that the times 
ahead, with progress in implementing agreements between Israel 
and the Palestinian people, should immediately see the 
beginnings of a change in the quality of life, we hope. Beyond 
that, others elsewhere will need to also feel the change. As 
you know Jordan has borne the brunt of the results of every 
disaster that occurred in the entire region. Jordan has been 
the home of Jordanians, whether they be of Palestinian origin or 
from whichever part of the Arab world they may be. And our 
position is still the same. All the members of the Jordanian 
family will continue to enjoy equal rights in our country, and 
hopefully equal opportunities to develop in the times ahead, and 
to live in the kind of environment that has not been possible so 
far. 
  I know many of you have looked at the region and worried 
about us all over many years. But it is a terrible situation 
when people don't know what each day would bring -- the strain, 
the effort, the uncertainty, the hope that this will change. So 
all in Jordan will remain members of the one family, proud of 
our reborn democracy, of the National Charter that was put 
together by all schools of political thought in our country, of 
the growing pride of the people of Jordan in their achievements, 
of their determination to partake in shaping their future, of 
respect for human rights, respect for human rights in Jordan and 
hopefully within the region, of the model, of the example, that 
this small country in a very critical area hopefully can be to 
others, until such time when others may have the opportunity to 
return or be compensated or whatever their choice may be. There 
have been many promises regarding the region in the context of 
peace so far. I believe the opportunities that will be 
presenting themselves once we reach that point are tremendous 
for a partnership between us all in creating a new Middle East, 
in creating something entirely different to anything that has 
been there for so many years, in creating peace and harmony and 
mutual respect between the followers of the three great 
monotheistic religions -- the three Abrahamic religions, in 
creating opportunities for cooperation, in creating an example 
for others the world over. 
  I would like to thank you very, very much indeed for your 
patience and your time and the opportunity to be with you.

  [Excerpt] Washington (Agencies)--His Majesty King Husayn 
said Wednesday [26 January] that Israel should focus more on 
negotiating the issues of conflict and arrive at just and 
comprehensive solutions rather than seeking to sign a peace 
accord with Jordan first and then negotiate the issues. 
  The King, addressing a press briefing here on the final day 
of a visit to Washington, said while Jordan was indeed involved 
in sorting out the issues on the table with Israel, it was not 
losing sight of its objective of a comprehensive settlement to 
the overall Middle East conflict. 
  The King's comments effectively quashed media suggestions 
that Jordan and Israel were close to finalising a peace 
agreement. 
  The King said: "We are working in regard to our own sphere, 
we are trying to see at the same that we encourage movement on 
all other tracks and I believe problems elsewhere are probably 
less than they are as they affect us because Jordan has borne 
the brunt of every disaster that has occurred over the years and 
the heaviest of weights. So we have a long way to go, but I 
hope that with goodwill on either side--Israeli and 
Jordanian--we will see rapid progress. I hope it will come 
together some time." 
  King Husayn called for an "interfaith dialogue" to determine 
sovereignty over the Christian, Jewish and Islamic holy places 
in Jerusalem. 
  King Husayn suggested it was time to move the issue "outside 
the political equation." 
  The King repeated the Arab position that Israel must return 
the Arab portion of Jerusalem to their control. 
  He said there was a "need to consider maybe for the first 
time in our history in the region, the possibility... of an 
interfaith dialogue... on possibly the sovereignty over these 
holy places." 
  "Maybe the followers of the three great religions can come 
to 
realise what the signififcance of Jerusalem is to all of them 
and move it outside the political equation," he said. 
  Asked for his concept of the fruits of a Middle East peace, 
King Husayn said it holds "the promise of an entirely different 
future." 
  "The talents that are available, the resources that are 
available, the opportunities that are available, I believe will 
transform the entire region," he said. 
  He also said that peace could bring about the removal of 
many 
barriers particularly to trade saying it could produce what he 
called "Middle East NAFTA." 
  The King said he has "no hangup" about meeting with Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  "I hope that an opportunity will arise," he said, but added 
that he did not expect such a meeting to take place "in the 
immediate future." 
  "Our people are meeting, we are negotiating. It is only 
normal that such a meeting will take place," the King said while 
posing for photographers with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  Earlier, at the press briefing, the King said the meeting 
would have to be properly prepared so that it could accomplish 
something. 
  "It's normal when moving toward peace that people meet," he 
said. 
  On Jordan's relations with the Gulf states, particularly 
with 
Saudi Arabia, he said: 
  "As far as Jordan is concerned we have always had... if you 
take it that way, I have been a follower of my grandfather, and 
his Late Majesty King 'Abd-al-'Aziz Bin-Sa'ud who came together 
and settled their differences and left us the responsibility to 
work together as members of one family in the interest of our 
nation. Our relations have passed through a period... I think 
that there are so many aspects that have to be addressed and 
could be addressed when we are able to meet face to face as I 
have tried since the outset. 
  "As far as we are concerned, we are most anxious to see the 
relations return to their warmth and to be based on mutual 
confidence and trust and to be based on the desire to cooperate 
in the interest of the Arab Nation as a whole. 
  "I hope the time will come, and I think we are moving in the 
right direction and I believe when we have a chance to meet we 
will discover that it was a very serious storm in a teacup, and 
I hope that our brethren in Saudi Arabia will realise that we 
never meant them any harm nor did we cause them any harm at all." 
  On Iraq and the continuing U.N. sanctions on that country, 
the King said: 
  "I have always said that I hope that this nightmare will 
come 
to an end sometime very soon, and particularly as it impacts on 
the Iraqi people and their continued suffering under the 
prevailing conditions. Somehow I hope we will get out of the 
area of Iraq not being an active, constructive part of the Arab 
world and the community of nations as soon as possible. 
  He said his version of peace was "peace, a real peace, a 
peace that gives everybody the opportunity to work together and 
to achieve their hopes for the future. And I spoke in detail 
about some of the problems that we have to address. 
  "(A) [as published] The problem of occupied territories, and 
I am talking of Jordanian occupied territories without prejudice 
to what our Palestinian brethren are talking about right now. 
And I have stated categorically that in that regard we feel 
very, very strongly that these areas--the small problem in the 
north of the Jordan Valley but there is a considerable area in 
the southern Jordan Valley that needs to be looked at in the 
sense of the urgency of our demand that Jordanian territory be 
returned to us. So there is the suggestion, and hopefully 
movement, on creating a group that will look at delineation and 
demarcation of the borders. And I hope that the coming days 
will see some progress here and people can move on the ground 
there. Once that is settled--and it has to mean the return of 
Jordanian territory to Jordanian sovereignty--then we can look 
at the entire rift valley and look at what can be done in the 
context of looking at it as a complete economic unit--in terms 
of resources, in terms of all the potential that there is to 
develop into the best way possible to the benefit of all. 
  "So the question of borders and territories and sovereignty 
over our territories is one of the aspects that has to be 
addressed. Another area is water, and there again, I believe 
that all the available resources might not be adquate for the 
needs of all concerned in the future, but certainly we have to 
work out the distribution of these waters in a satisfactory way 
in terms of the percentages that are peoples' rights. Beyond 
that, hopefully in a context of peace, we can look at what can 
be done beyond that to secure needed water for all concerned and 
obviously the third dimension--and this is not all because there 
are many other items on the agenda--is the human dimension. 
[sentence, punctuation as published] There has to be a 
qualitative change of life. I would hope that the priority will 
be given to people in the occupied territories, but beyond that, 
the region, for everybody to feel what peace is, to know that 
peace is, to realise what transformation there is as we progress 
along to its attainment." 
  "I am really optimistic and that is my tendency, of course I 
can never be absolutely certain that things will work the way we 
wish. But I think that there is a general concensus amongst the 
overwhelming majority of people that we move towards resolving 
problems. I hope Palestinians on their soil will enjoy 
democracy and pluralism, respect for human rights and a chance 
to live and work with us and I hope that Jordan and Palestine 
eventually can be an example to others in the entire region." 
  In reply to a question on an assertion in a book written by 
an Israeli general in which he said that the King went to Israel 
before the war of 73 and he warned the Israelis that the 
Egyptians and Syrians will attack them. 
  "Sir, when the war of 1973 occurred, we were not informed. 
It was kept from us. It took me totally by surprise. You know 
that and the world knows that. As far as the subject of 
contacts between Jordan and Israel, the ground rules had been 
that nothing should be said about these contacts but they have 
existed since the ratification of Security Council Resolution 
242 in an attempt to implement it in the context of Arab 
agreement until '74. After '74 it became the PLO's 
responsibility in accordance with an Arab summit decision and we 
have tried to persuade all to move in that direction. Only the 
Palestinians could speak for themselves. It has taken us since 
'74 to '93 to '94 to arrive at that point. Now things have 
moved. But any other suggestions are totally--in reference 
specifically to that question of yours, which I hope you 
wouldn't have asked in the first place--that is totally untrue, 
sir." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Crown Prince Hasan by Mira Avrekh at the </F>
royal palace in Amman; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Avrekh] You have never 
given an interview to an Israeli journalist. Why now? 
  [Hasan] During the Madrid conference, a meeting with an 
Israeli journalist might have been construed as an attempt to 
intervene in the peace process. Therefore, everything was done 
through official spokesmen. But now, after the White House 
meeting between Clinton, Peres, and myself, I believe it is 
important to present our points of view and concepts. 
  I must note that something annoyed me, and I will take this 
opportunity to clarify it. I am referring to the report 
published in the newsletter issued by BIPAC (the pro-Israeli 
lobby in Britain). It quoted -- in a very imprecise way -- a 
conversation I had with the editor of the Lebanese newspaper 
AL-SAFIR and created the impression that I had said that the 
meeting with Peres in Washington had been "forced" on me. 
  I have already sent Peres a message on that via Grenville 
Janner (a leader of British Jewry). That story harmed the 
Washington meeting, which took place in an atmosphere of mutual 
respect. It was also another reason why I thought it right to 
meet with an Israeli journalist now. 
  [Avrekh] The assumption in Israel has always been that 
Jordan would be the first -- or at least the second -- Arab 
state to sign a peace treaty with Israel. For years, there were 
meetings between Israelis and Jordanians, and you made sure the 
border remained quiet. Do you foresee an Israeli-Jordanian 
peace accord in 1994? 
  [Hasan] Definitely. I would like to stress that Jordan was, 
in fact, first. Already in the 1930's, my grandfather, King 
'Abdallah, offered the Jews autonomy. At that time, as is 
known, the State of Israel had not yet been established, and 
that idea could have served as a framework for coexistence. In 
fact, my grandfather paid with his life for his beliefs. 
  Jordan adopted a long list of initiatives. There is a 
lengthy history of meetings between senior Israelis and 
Jordanians. In my view, the question is why we did not manage 
to make progress on basic security issues for 25 years. It is 
our impression that Israel finds it hard to agree openly and 
publicly to final recognition of its borders with Jordan. 
  In fact, this is quite a marginal issue compared with the 
territorial problem with Syria or the demand for withdrawal from 
Lebanese territory. Israel apparently fears creating a 
precedent. But we, for our part, aspire to the principle of 
implementing sovereignty on our borders, and I am referring to 
the borders from the time of the British Mandate. If we manage 
to define sovereignty within the concept of borders, then we 
will be able to make progress on water and refugee issues. 
  I would like to stress that the peace we want is a "warm 
peace." Therefore, for instance, we welcomed the Declaration of 
Principles between Israel and the PLO because it broke the 
"taboo." The very act of shaking hands was important, but what 
has still not been done, and must now be done, is to insert that 
agreement of principles into an overall peace framework. 
  It is clear that statesmen on both sides are trying to 
create 
"windows" to peace. But if we do not have a vision of a 
peaceful region, it will be very hard to achieve peace in the 
most important areas. The water problem cannot be solved 
through bilateral meetings. The human problem cannot be solved 
by making Jordan a "garbage dump" in order to solve the 
demographic problems of the region. 
  We therefore welcomed the good news of the Clinton-al-Asad 
meeting; we welcomed the good news of the talks between the 
Palestinians and the Israelis. But we must ask ourselves: Will 
it lead us to a "warm peace?" 
  [Avrekh] You talk about returning to the mandatory 
borders, but in negotiations both parties have to give up 
something. Can we reach peace this way? 
  [Hasan] In Jordan's case, there is a clear, simple line 
which starts in the Jordan Valley, runs through the center of 
the Jordan River, and continues up to the Red Sea. Therefore, 
we are not talking about the demarcation of new borders, but 
rather of recognizing a principle -- even if this recognition 
has not yet been made public. This must be done in the 
framework of the bilateral talks. 
  I would like to explain that I am not bringing up this 
problem as part of an attempt to raise obstacles or sabotage the 
process. This issue is important to our people. People will 
say, as you mentioned earlier, that for 20 years our countries 
have been neither at peace nor at war. Jordan, for of its own 
security considerations, was committed to preventing 
infiltrations across its western border. People will ask what 
Jordan received in return for this? 
  American visitors come and tell us: We want open meetings 
between Jordanians and Israelis. I say: Instead of holding 
public meetings on tourism or on economic issues, which we are 
doing anyway at the Washington and Paris talks, we must meet on 
the issue of sovereignty. This will let us leave the problems 
of border demarcation behind and let us move on to discuss the 
rational use of our resources. 
  [Avrekh] How will the Palestinians fit in here? 
  [Hasan] At the moment, I am talking about the sovereign 
affairs of the State of Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan. This 
especially pertains to the southern part of the 'Arava valley. 
For example, if one seeks to promote the idea of a canal 
between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, or develop the 
Elat-al-'Aqabah free trade zone concept, then the current 
situation, in which soldiers stop potential investors at the 
cease fire lines because it is a security area, is 
inconceivable. Therefore, a resolution of this problem will 
constitute a breakthrough. 
  [Avrekh] Do you see the possibility of establishing a joint 
airport between al-'Aqabah and Elat? The 1986 London Agreement 
(between King Husayn and Shim'on Peres) spoke of granting Jordan 
access to a Mediterranean port. Do you believe that progress 
toward implementing these ideas can be made in 1994? 
  [Hasan] This once more brings us back to our starting point 
-- the border question. After all, if one talks about an 
airport, one is also dealing with civilian airspace zones and so 
forth. This is also true with regard to ports. Thus, if we 
satisfactorily resolve of the problem of sovereignty, we can 
make progress toward effectively treating other problems. 
  [Avrekh] The London Agreement got off to a promising start, 
but suddenly got "stuck." What exactly happened there? 
  [Hasan] I believe there were different interpretations: 
There was former Secretary of State Shultz' interpretation, 
Peres' interpretation, and perhaps also our own interpretation. 
But eventually what happened was that Peres, foreign minister 
at the time, went back to the Israeli Government with proposals 
which were based on the agreement. The government had just 
changed, and Shamir had assumed the premiership. The London 
Agreement did not head the government's list of priorities and 
it was "frozen." Shultz, for his part, was too slow in 
presenting the issue. 
  We can also go back to 1974. At the time we had some 
agreements of a limited nature which were reached after the Yom 
Kippur War. The possibility of a partial withdrawal to the lines 
of the "Alon Plan" [plan by former Labor party minister calling 
for territorial compromise with Israel retaining control of 
strategic areas] was discussed. There was also an idea, raised 
in 1972, for a Jordanian-Israeli confederation. Ultimately, 
none of this was implemented. 
  As for the 1986 plan, it is important to stress that we 
presented a development plan for the occupied territories. It 
is reasonable to assume that this plan would have prevented a 
great many of the manifestations of extremism you have been 
forced to live with since 1988. The plan, however, was rejected 
and Israel viewed it as a Jordanian attempt to intervene in the 
affairs of the occupied territories. 
  [Avrekh] Were the issues of water and economy, that you 
mentioned before, discussed by King Husayn and Shim'on Peres in 
Amman approximately two months ago? 
  [Hasan, laughing] I will put it this way: Yes, these issues 
were raised in the framework of the continuous contacts with Mr. 
Peres. 
  [Avrekh] When, in your opinion, will Israelis be able to 
visit Petra? You must know that this has always been the dream 
of many Israeli youths. 
  [Hasan] The question of tourism and reciprocal visits is 
very important and has to be discussed in the framework of the 
peace process. The issue of tourism must be resolved in the 
framework of bilateral agreements between our two states. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Avrekh] How would you describe Jordan's involvement in the 
peace process between the Palestinians and Israel? 
  [Hasan] First of all, one must remember that Jordan granted 
the Palestinians shelter -- and, on the other hand, benefited 
from their contribution during three demographic waves in 1948, 
1967, and 1991 (when Kuwait and other Gulf states expelled 
Palestinians to Jordan). 
  As for the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, it 
focuses on the 1967 refugees. The pre-1967 refugees, or in 
other words those from 1948, are asking: What do we gain from 
this declaration? 
  This clearly is an emotionally charged problem. We must make 
people understand that peace offers something for everyone, for 
every human being. This cannot be explained in a one-sided 
fashion. You, for example, have a concept calling for the 
ingathering of the diaspora, of bringing Jews to Israel from 
various, diverse, communities around the world. In addition, 
the State of Israel also has a demographic problem. We, when 
talking about a comprehensive peace, the water problem.... 
[pauses] For example, we have to deal with the matter of water 
consumers in disputed areas. 
  In my opinion, most people realize this. They understand 
that peace is indeed an effective panacea, as long as peace is 
established throughout the entire region. This is the reason we 
stress the need for a comprehensive peace. 
  [Avrekh] What do you expect to be achieved at the meeting 
between King Husayn and President Clinton in Washington? 
Generally speaking, what is the present state of relations 
between Jordan and the United States? 
  [Hasan] Following the developments of the past three years 
and Operation Desert Storm, many questions about Jordan's role 
and positions were aired. However, I believe that there is 
growing recognition for the active role Jordan plays for the 
United States; something between Israel as a strategic asset and 
the strategic value of the oil wells. 
  In order to fulfill such a difficult role -- the 
"Finlandization" of Jordan, if that is the way it can be 
described (with reference to the important role played by 
neutral Finland during the Cold War) -- one must understand the 
kind of conditions required to guarantee stability in Jordan. 
Stability and security are a comprehensive and all encompassing 
concept. 
  I am also speaking in terms of "hard" security, which common 
to Jordan and other countries in the region: The military's 
role in deterring terrorism, preventing infiltrations by radical 
elements, drug interdiction, stopping weapons sales, and even 
preventing money laundering. 
  There are also problems of "soft" security. I am referring 
to problems connected with economic and social progress. I 
would like to see more efforts to redress inequality. Only 
recently has the American press begun to write about a situation 
in which the average per capita income for a Palestinian is 
$800, as compared to $15,000 for Israelis or for residents of 
the Gulf states. 
  These problems, which are closely linked to a person's 
ability to live with dignity, must be resolved in the framework 
of the peace process. 
  As for the meeting between King Husayn and President Clinton 
-- I think it must lead to practical steps. For example, in my 
meeting today with a congressional delegation, we discussed the 
establishment of a Middle East free trade zone, something 
similar to NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) in our 
region. We spoke of cooperating in the establishment of a 
Middle East development bank. 
  As I said before, agreement on the issue of sovereignty and 
border demarcation is a prerequisite for all this. Afterwards, 
we can start work on resolving the water problem, on developing 
the region's human potential, and on effecting the economic 
integration of the region to bring us into the 21st century. 
  [Avrekh] With your permission, I would like to return to 
the Clinton-al-Asad summit. In your opinion, has al-Asad 
changed because the USSR collapsed and he now needs the United 
States, or because he realized with time, that war, or a state 
of war and no peace, will lead him nowhere? 
  [Hasan] It is a combination of the things you mentioned. 
The bipolar world we knew when the USSR existed is gone. That 
means that new regional definitions and characteristics must 
grow now. We have to recognize that we must redefine the Middle 
East as a "region." 
  Almost every part of the world is defined as a region, 
while, 
though called this, the Middle East has so far been a collection 
of individual countries that have not operated on a regional 
basis. The international community has bilateral contacts with 
the various countries, not with the region as such. 
  In 1975, Syria, Egypt, and Jordan signed an agreement for 
economic cooperation with Europe. Israel and Lebanon signed a 
similar agreement. I am certain that it benefited Israel much 
more than it did the Arab countries. I believe that Damascus 
feels, just as we feel here in Amman, that it would be very 
difficult to compete with other regions if we do not define the 
Middle East as a region. For example, South Africa, where peace 
has also been made now, is seeking international investments and 
the world's attention. 
  It would be very difficult to go on talking in the sterile 
context of individual Arab capitals or "lonesome Israel." 
Indeed, I am certain that the time has come to redefine 
Southwest Asia, or the eastern Mediterranean shores. I believe 
these views certainly exist in, and are expressed by Damascus. 
  Naturally, in order to make this aspiration come true, the 
parties involved should be given incentives -- and not only 
negative ones. President Nixon once told me that in order to 
attain peace, you have to "pressure" each of the parties a 
little. Well, Jordan has been "pressured" enough... (laughing). 
  [Avrekh] What do you see as the solution to the security 
problems of the Middle East by the year 2000? 
  [Hasan] I believe in the concept of a Middle East conference 
on security cooperation. As will be recalled, this was done in 
Europe with success. We must identify and define our enemies, 
and I speak of common enemies such as terrorism, which is a 
clear case, or drugs. In this case, we may certainly speak of 
regional cooperation. 
  At the same time, if we are stuck with dealing with the old 
"skeletons" of the previous conflicts, it would be very hard to 
produce movement or flexibility toward an agreement to reduce 
the size of the military establishments in the region. 
  Incidentally, I believe that on this matter we pay too much 
attention to American research institutes such as Brookings, 
Enterprise, or Carnegie. What do we, the residents of the 
region, contribute to the vision of our regional security? This 
issue was raised in my discussion with President Clinton and 
Minister Peres. 
  [Avrekh] How do you view the ups and downs of the 
Israel-Palestinian negotiations? What do you think of 'Arafat's 
conduct? 
  [Hasan] To a certain extent, the problems stem from the 
manner in which the agreement of principles was made -- the 
secrecy of the Oslo talks. Still, as we have said several times 
before, it is essential to move on from Oslo and the Washington 
handshake to the practical things required to make the autonomy 
materialize. 
  [Avrekh] What are the implications of the PLO-Jordan 
economic agreement on economic relations between Israel and the 
West Bank? 
  [Hasan] It is obvious that the central banks of Israel and 
Jordan share a common interest in promoting an economic entity 
that could mediate between the various Palestinian territories. 
Naturally, we would like to see international, as well as Arab, 
investments in the territories through existing apparatuses. 
Obviously, the Palestinians want to establish a development 
bank, but I would like it to be established in a regional 
framework. In the end, it is up to the Palestinians to decide 
on how to solve the practical problems. 
  [Avrekh] What is your view of economic cooperation between 
Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians by the year 2000? 
  [Hasan] Well, in 1970, an Israeli research institute 
presented an "assignment of duties" between Israel, Egypt, and 
Jordan. The basic idea was that the Arab countries will provide 
the manpower, while Israel provides the technology. I believe 
that such strict assignment of duties is not required. I would 
like to see the Middle East as the European coast of Asia, and 
the Asian coast of Europe. 
  [Avrekh] Could you point at a date when a peace accord will 
be signed between Israel and Jordan? 
  [Hasan] I have already mentioned that we need "warm peace." 
I hope that 1994 will be the year of crossing the threshold to 
such peace. Whether this crossing of threshold will include the 
signing a peace contract, depends on the creativity and honesty 
of the parties. 
  [Avrekh] But you believe it is possible? 
  [Hasan] We live in the Middle East, so we have to believe in 
miracles....

<F P=106> [Report by Hala Madi] </F>
  [Text] Following the Geneva summit between Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, Lebanese parties 
will be reviewing their positions and calculations before the 
resumption of bilateral negotiations this month in Washington. 
  Among these parties is Hizballah. Both at home and abroad, 
Hizballah is widely seen as one party that is more likely than 
others to do some rethinking. Hizballah's regional and domestic 
views link its fate closely to the talks. Hizballah is known 
for its special links with Iran, a country that aspires to a 
regional role and sees Lebanon as a major vehicle for that role. 
  According to Hizballah sources, the party has not awaited 
the 
convocation of this summit or the resumption of negotiations to 
redraw its guidelines and rethink its role. Hizballah, thanks 
to the information it has and the close contact it maintains 
with Damascus and Tehran, has for a long time prepared its 
answer to all possibilities involving the talks' success or 
failure. Hizballah has been getting ready for all the possible 
outcomes and repercussions of the negotiations ever since they 
started. 
  Domestically, Hizballah's position continues to be one of 
general opposition to negotiations and reconciliation with 
Israel. It will continue to maintain this position. What 
changed is the method of confrontation it will follow depending 
on whether the negotiations succeed or fail. 
  If the negotiations succeed, Lebanon will, naturally, sign a 
peace agreement with Israel. In this case, Hizballah will 
oppose any agreement before Israel withdraws completely from 
Lebanon. If Israel withdraws before reaching such an agreement, 
Hizballah will consider this withdrawal a victory for the 
resistance. Subsequently, Hizballah will examine ways of 
adjusting to the coming phase and its regional implications. If 
the signing of the peace agreement with Israel takes place 
before Israel's withdrawal, Hizballah will fight this agreement 
and seek to annul it. 
  In this context, well-informed sources say that Hizballah 
has 
told senior security officials that it is opposed to any peace 
agreement reached before an Israeli withdrawal. Hizballah's 
Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah has met with security 
officials and told them in no uncertain terms that "if someone 
tries to shed our blood, ours will not be the only blood shed." 
  According to the same sources, if the negotiations fail to 
produce positive results, Hizballah will continue its course of 
armed resistance. It has taken all precautions and preparations 
to continue the confrontation. According to reliable 
information obtained by AL-SHIRA', the decision to continue the 
military confrontation, pending the outcome of the negotiations, 
is divided into two parts: The first is to introduce internal 
changes and the second is to rehabilitate all Hizballah elements 
militarily. 
  Regarding the first part, the two visits paid by Hizballah 
Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah to Tehran in the past few 
months resulted in several agreements designed to bring about 
better control of the party's various political, security, and 
social departments. One important result of these two visits 
was a decision to strengthen the security and political 
departments, confine them in the hands of Nasrallah, and 
eliminate all departments subservient to Iranian officials. 
For this purpose, a special bureau has been established under 
the control of Nasrallah. The bureau will coordinate in advance 
all military and security operations and seek Nasrallah's 
approval of them. Consequently, 'Abd-al-Hadi Hammadi has given 
up his security responsibilities within the party. Hizballah 
has also focused its activity on the south at the expense of its 
presence in other areas. It has given priority to the south on 
all levels, especially in the field of services and in 
implementation of the secret resolutions of a conference it held 
seven months ago. The conference was then unofficially coined 
the "South Conference." 
  Regarding the second part, namely military rehabilitation, 
in 
the past three months Hizballah has retrained all its full-time 
and part-time elements. It has retrained 10,000 full-time 
fighters in several classes held in al-Hirmil and nearby areas. 
The training took place under the supervision of the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard. Long courses, some lasting over two months, 
were held for cadres, military officials, and others in Tehran. 
The part-timers who are able to fight have undergone 10-day 
training courses. About 6,000 part-timers have taken part in 
these courses. 
  If Hizballah has reviewed its calculations and prepared 
itself for the coming period, other parties in the Lebanese 
arena will also find themselves compelled to review their 
calculations after the Geneva summit. This particularly applies 
to the parties that have opposed the al-Ta'if accord, as well as 
the parties that have wagered and still are wagering that 
international and regional developments will turn the clock back 
in Lebanon.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement by Islamic Students Association of the </F>
Amir Kabir Industrial University; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Your Excellency, Esteemed Interior Minister, 
following your remarks in the Islamic Republic of Iran, which 
were full of accusations, when you hid under the cover of 
"solidarity against the United States" and attacked the purest 
Muslim forces that believe in the Islamic system and were the 
heart of those anti- U.S. forces who were behind the advent of 
the "second revolution" [the occupation of the U.S. Embassy in 
Tehran by students], it is necessary to mention the following 
points: [passage omitted] 
  -- Do you fear students' protests against questioning the 
values of the revolution and their condemnation of 
American-style Islam and its suitability, as elucidated by the 
imam? This [American-style Islam] takes the form of foreign 
borrowing and economic policies that result in greater pressure 
on the deprived and oppressed strata; unlimited imports that 
have undermined the production system of the country; factories 
that have been auctioned off to the benefit of foreigners and 
affiliated investors; extensive and ludicrous publicity for 
foreign goods such as American Coca-Cola, foreign appliances, 
candies, bananas, and so on with foreign loans that have 
antagonized the Muslim forces and domestic producers; opening 
doors to foreign trucks; and the propagation of all means of 
decadence that are opposed to the pristine culture of Islam and 
our Islamic country. [passage omitted covered in referent item] 
  -- Your Excellency, you are the one who is violating all the 
revolutionary values. You have indulged in extensive flights of 
fancy, which have exceeded all the boundaries specified by the 
founder of the Republic. Therefore, please consider this 
warning seriously; that you are not in a position where you, Mr. 
Minister, can make such claims, as all your legitimacy and that 
of your decrees depends on the fact that you are an official of 
the Islamic Republic, which is headed by the Vali-ye Faqih [The 
supreme jurisconsult]. [passage omitted] 
  O God Almighty! You know what the Americans and their ilk 
have done in our country and the entire world. They have shed 
the blood of Muslims, have subjugated and pillaged our resources 
and our honor, and have planted their puppet governments. They 
have killed, burned, and plundered and now they are preparing 
for the most extensive and multifaceted onslaught of all, based 
on their communications technology. We beseech you to grant our 
officials awareness, the power to plan against this eventuality. 
[passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan in Peshawar and 'Abdallah </F>
al-Hajj in Jeddah] 
  [Text] Peshawar, Jeddah--The scope of air raids against 
Kabul was broadened yesterday. Aircraft of the Uzbek militias, 
which are led by General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, raided the 
presidential palace, which is the headquarters of President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, Kabul Airport, the main intelligence 
center, and other government positions. Sources close to the 
militias have told AL-HAYAH that the raids are intended to pave 
the way for an assault that they will launch jointly with the 
supporters of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar to seize 
control of Kabul. 
  It has also been reported that militia aircraft have, 
moreover, raided the stronghold of the Ettehad-e Eslami, which 
is led by Sheykh 'Abd-Rabb Rasul Seyyef, in Paghman, west of the 
capital. It is well known that Seyyaf is a close associate of 
the Afghan president. 
  Afghan diplomatic sources have reported that government 
forces have downed a MiG-21 belonging to the militias in Paghman 
and that they have killed General ['Abdol] Ghafar Pahlawan, a 
most prominent Uzbek militia commander, in clashes between the 
two sides in the city of Mazar-e Sharif, one of northern 
Afghanistan's largest cities. These sources added that 
Habibollah Beg, another Uzbek general, and 2,000 of his fighters 
have surrendered to the government forces in Faryab Governorate. 
  Sources of the Jami'at-e Eslami, led by Rabbani, in Peshawar 
have told AL-HAYAH that government aircraft have not taken part 
in the Kabul battles because they have been busy raiding militia 
positions in Mazar-e Sharif so as to strike these militias in 
their stronghold. 
  Yesterday, Hekmatyar's supporters issued a statement 
reiterating their demand that the president resign and 
reaffirming their rejection of a cease-fire unless Rabbani 
responds to this demand. A committee of field commanders has 
declared its rejection of the demands of both sides and has 
called for forming a new and neutral government. 
<H5>  Imminent Assault </H5>
  Sources close to Dostam have told AL-HAYAH that the air 
raids 
are in preparation for a fierce assault that the militias will 
launch jointly with the Hezb-e Eslami, which is headed by Prime 
Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, within 72 hours to seize Kabul. 
The sources added that the air raids are intended to weaken and 
destroy the government forces' defenses. 
  Yesterday, Pakistan closed its border in the face of 
emigrants fleeing the war in the capital. Pakistani Government 
sources have said that 14,000 Afghan citizens have crossed the 
border into Pakistan since the battles started at the beginning 
of this month. 
<H5>  Calls for Peace </H5>
  At a time when Pakistan has urged the feuding parties to 
stop 
the fighting, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has called for 
an immediate truce and urged all Afghans to settle their 
conflicts peacefully. 
  The Afghan Peace Committee, which is led by Field Commander 
Jalaloddin Haqqani and which includes prominent 'ulema, field 
commanders, and intellectuals, held a press conference in which 
it has called for forming an expanded consultative council.

by the Likud further states that the way to attain stability and

agreements. 
  [Begin Sarid recording] I am telling you: As far as I am 
concerned, the PLO has not yet built confidence. It signed the 
agreement, but my impression at this point is that it is not 
honoring that signature. Up until now, I have not discerned any 
interest on its part in what is happening in the field, and I 
find this very disappointing and depressing. [end recording] 
  Having said that, Minister Sarid went on to assert that a 
Palestinian state will definitely be established. According to 
him, the establishment of a Palestinian state is an inevitable 
natural development.

  [Text] Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu says he relayed a 
message to Jordan's King Husayn via Spain's King Juan Carlos 
when the latter visited Israel. He wrote the Jordanian king 
that he believes Israel and Jordan share a joint interest in 
opposing the establishment of a Palestinian state because it 
would conspire against the Hashemite court and seek to annex 
Jordan, and would later act against Israel. Moreover, Netanyahu 
wrote, Israel is interested in upholding the Hashemite regime in 
Jordan and in having a permanent arrangement in Judaea and 
Samaria that would maintain the link between the majority of the 
population there and Jordan. 
  Tzomet supports a peace agreement with Jordan based on the 
current situation. Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan told our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht that relations with Jordan in the last 
few years constitute a de facto peace agreement, which could now 
be given legal expression.

<F P=106> [Article by Chief Editor Hasan Sabra: "Al-Asad's Summit"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] President al-Asad arrived in 
Geneva backed by a cohesive domestic front, a comfortable 
economy, a huge modern Army, a unified vision, and a decisive 
spirit. Can Washington, the West, and those who inform and 
carry out analyses for President Clinton possibly forget that 
pan-Arab Syria, with its secular system, is the only country 
without an Islamic fundamentalism problem, indeed, the only Arab 
country that uses fundamentalist groups to strengthen its 
position anywhere? 
  The West cannot forget that Syria has often come under 
siege, 
so critical in one case that the Syrian Treasury contained under 
$50,000 in hard currency. Yet Syria never retreated; indeed, it 
became more committed and more determined. [passage omitted] 
  What does al-Asad want and what did he achieve? 
  What does Clinton want and what did he achieve? 
  Al-Asad got an American presence in Geneva, a meeting with 
an 
Arab president, when the Americans are used to summoning Third 
World leaders, including some Arabs. 
  Al-Asad had a chance for full, comprehensive, and methodic 
talks with Clinton. He forced the President of the world's 
biggest power to listen to him for five and a half hours. 
Al-Asad did most of the talking. Usually, the Americans summon 
presidents to convey brief messages within minutes. They then 
look at their watches and allow photographers in to take 
pictures--perhaps the most important outcome of meetings with 
U.S. Presidents. 
  President al-Asad entrenched the Madrid formula for a 
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on the exchange of 
land for peace and the implementation of Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338. President al-Asad added Security 
Council Resolution 425 concerning Lebanon and the American 
President agreed. This resolution was not discussed in the past 
so as to reassure Syria that Israel would not take advantage and 
tempt some Lebanese into thinking that a separate deal with 
Lebanon could be concluded on the basis of the resolution. 
  Al-Asad established that dialogue to achieve settlement is 
not held directly with the Zionist enemy, but directly with 
Washington as a sponsor (together with Russia) of the peace 
conference. The conference was originally held on this basis. 
It continues to be held on the same basis although Israel 
affected the unified Arab position through the separate deal 
with Yasir 'Arafat and its Gaza-Jericho offshoot. 
  Al-Asad returned the just and comprehensive peace to the 
peace process headlines. The American President stated his 
agreement publicly at the news conference after having stated it 
in the meeting. 
  President al-Asad's success in reviving the idea of a 
comprehensive peace seems the equivalent of the fall of the 
Gaza-Jericho deal. This means al-Asad is again holding the 
Palestinian card. What the Palestinians lost through 
'Arafat--the dream of a state--can be achieved through al-Asad 
within the framework of the comprehensive peace as an 
alternative to 'Arafat's separate deal. 
  Al-Asad succeeded in turning the meeting with President 
Bill Clinton into a chance to normalize relations with the 
United States. This nullifies Israel's pronouncement--which 
succeeded in the cases of al-Sadat and 'Arafat--that 
normalization with Israel is the key to normalization with the 
United States. Al-Asad appeared very successful in making 
normalization with the United States the key to an Arab-Zionist 
settlement and then to the establishment of successful relations 
with the United States. 
  Successful bilateral relations with Washington allow Syria 
to 
play a major regional role affecting Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, 
and perhaps others, especially since Damascus has special 
relations with Tehran and good ties with Egypt, Libya, Yemen, 
and most Arab Gulf states. With this, the Golan is restored, 
and Syria's forthcoming role grows bigger. 
  Israel sought normalization with Syria so that it could 
infiltrate the Arab east, as it succeeded through the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement with 'Arafat. 
  But by normalizing its relations with Washington, Damascus 
can retain a full pan-Arab role that will certainly not be in 
Israel's favor. 
  Al-Asad--and this is very important--succeeded in convincing 
the U.S. Administration that Israel is the party that must say 
whether it wants peace or not. Even more, he succeeded in 
persuading Clinton to rearrange the settlement priorities to be 
as follows: first, withdrawal; second, security; third, normal 
relations. 
  Withdrawal is needed from Israel. 
  Security is needed from Israel and Syria. 
  Normal relations are needed from Syria. 
  Moreover, al-Asad managed to tell the Americans, and Clinton 
agreed, that if peace is not achieved now, Israel will be held 
responsible; Syria will bear no consequences, and no one can 
then threaten it or accuse it of terrorism. 
  Al-Asad also managed to differentiate between Hizballah, 
which the United States accuses of terrorism, and the resistance 
to liberate the south from the Zionist occupation, although 
Hizballah is the main tool of resistance there. 
  Concerning withdrawal, Clinton accepted al-Asad's condition. 
Al-Asad threw the ball into the Zionist court and sowed the 
seeds of a U.S.-Israeli dispute. 
  It must be said that al-Asad did not make the Golan issue 
the 
driving force behind his movement and demands so that he could 
not be easily besieged and forced into concessions. Although he 
said the Golan is in the heart of Syria, he never forgot that 
Syria's role is much larger than a piece of land, no matter how 
valuable. 
  Concerning security, President al-Asad returned the ball to 
the American court. He said Damascus is threatened because it 
is only a few kilometers away from the occupied land while the 
Palestinian (Israeli) cities are hundreds of kilometers away 
from the front. This presents America with an invitation to come 
to the region at Syria's request, not against Syria's will. 
This would ensure security for Syria and stop resistance 
operations against occupation, which is supposed to end; 
occupation is removed and resistance then stops. 
  As regards normal relations, peace is established through 
the 
desire of the Arab people at a time when such peace appears to 
be the least of all evils, made at the hands of a leadership 
that achieved the maximum level of hopes and dreams at this 
stage, and at a time when the world appeared stunned at the 
capabilities of this leader, who, in the darkest of times, 
manages to get the best terms and those closest to Arab hopes in 
an age of retreats. 
  No one should forget that what President al-Asad achieved at 
this stage is the same thing offered to us when Arab solidarity 
was at its peak, when Egypt was the leader of the Arab world, 
when Arab oil and money were available and undepleted, when the 
Soviet Union existed with its military, economic, and political 
support and international influence, when Iraq was healthy 
before two destructive wars, when Israel did not have nuclear 
weapons, when Zionist superiority was clear but not decisive, 
when Lebanon was not destroyed, and when Palestinian resistance 
was active. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Rabat, Jan. 25 (MAP) -- "Any separate agreement with 
Israel is doomed to [word indistinct]" said Syrian Ambassador in 
Rabat 'Ali Hasan. 
  In a statement to Moroccan private TV Channel (2M), the 
Syrian ambassador said his country is for a comprehensive 
settlement to the Mideast crisis and will not accept that Israel 
withdraws from the Golan Heights while maintaining its 
occupation of southern Lebanon. 
  On the latest al-Asad-Clinton summit, the Syrian ambassador 
said President Clinton pledged to see to the implementation of 
the UN Security Council resolutions while President Hafiz 
al-Asad stressed the need to grant importance to the Arab 
viewpoint far from the Zionist propaganda. 
  On the presence of the Syrian Army in southern Lebanon, 'Ali 
Hasan said the Syrian presence cannot be compared in any way to 
that of Israel. "Syria came to southern Lebanon at the request 
of the Lebanese Government while Israel used force to occupy the 
zone", the Syrian ambassador explained.

  [Text] Kathmandu, Jan 24 (AFP) -- Nepalese Prime Minister 
Girija Prasad Koirala was jeered and catcalled by opposition 
groups at a rally south of here Monday [24 Jan], communist party 
sources said. 
  The demonstrators, brandishing black flags, were activists 
of 
the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) 
and other opposition groups. 
  Koirala, who was speaking at Mahendra Nagar, 435 kilometres 
(270 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, said: "I have seen black 
flags many times but such things will not disconcert me." 
  He said protests and slogans were not sufficient to speed 
development. More important was the stability of democracy 
which had been restored in Nepal after a long struggle, the 
state radio quoted him as saying. 
  "Everybody has the right to opposition in a democracy, but I 
wonder whether this right has any place in a communist system," 
he asked. 
  He urged Nepalese to unite to fight elements trying to 
weaken 
democracy. 
  He said communism had almost vanished from the face of the 
earth and was unlikely to rise again.

  [Text] Kathmandu, Jan 14 (AFP) -- Nepal has formally 
launched a stock exchange for the first time with 62 public 
limited companies listed, a Finance Ministry official said 
Friday [14 Jan]. 
  A Finance Ministry official said of the listed companies, 
only 36 are operating while the rest are gradually coming into 
the scene. 
  "The paid up value of the 62 listed companies is 1.68 
billion 
million [as received] US dollars and the market value of them is 
3.8 billion rupees," the official said. 
  "While launching the stock exchange market in Kathmandu, the 
government also issued the broker-licenses to 25 people," he 
said. 
  "After amendments in the Nepal Company Act in the 
forthcoming 
winter session of the parliament, provisions will be made to 
permit foreign entrepreneurs and individuals to purchase 
shares," he said. 
  "All formalities for foreign company trading for the 
Nepalese 
shares will be completed by mid-July," he added. 
  The main objective of creating the Stock Exchange Market in 
Nepal is to help develop an open market economy, the official 
said. 
  Soon after the opening of the exchange Thursday [13 Jan], 
shares worth 76,370 rupees were sold, he said. 
  "The United States Agency for International Development and 
the Unit Trust of India have helped to provide manpower training 
to handle the stock exchange," the foreign ministry official 
said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bhushan Marwah of THE HINDUSTAN TIMES: </F>
"India's 45th Republic Day"] 
  [Text] India has taken a confident stride toward its 45th 
Republic Day [26 Jan] as a country with more respect in the 
community of nations, better political stability, and 
substantially liberalized foreign trade as well as domestic 
economy. 
  In the international relations, India has continued to 
strive 
for better relations with other countries, particularly its 
neighbors; and barring Pakistan, it has met with a tremendous 
success in building up realistic, mutually respectful, and 
economically cooperative relationship with all the countries, 
more so with its immediate neighbors. Even with Pakistan, India 
has been all along keen to normalize its ties and have a 
mutually beneficial economic and cultural exchange. However, 
Pakistan's attitude has been grossly unreasonable, aggressively 
chauvinistic, and designed to malign this country. The 
Interservices Intelligence, ISI, of Pakistan has been aiding and 
abetting terrorist activities as well as current of separatism 
in Kashmir, Punjab, and the eastern parts of this country. The 
latest reports suggest that Pakistan is preparing more than 
10,000 Afghan mojahedin to push them into the Kashmir Valley to 
escalate militancy-related violence in the valley in its bid to 
continue disturbance in the state. Unnerved by the success of 
the security forces in their anti-militancy operations in recent 
months in Kashmir, Pakistan has evidently drawn this massive 
plan to push in more trained militants to further boost the 
otherwise sagging morale of the militants in the valley. 
  Surprisingly, the United States of America is not only 
turning a blind eye to all this, President Clinton has lately 
made biased and misinformed remarks on Kashmir, Punjab, and 
perceived abuse of human rights in this country. His remarks on 
Punjab on finding a solution to protect Sikhs' rights are not 
only uncharitable but also negate the very structure of 
secularism on which Indian polity and society are based. It 
goes contrary to the fabric of Indian Constitution where it is 
enshrined that in this country, everybody's right is protected 
irrespective of his caste, color and, creed. Predictably, India 
has taken strong exception to U.S. President's observation on 
Punjab and rejected the statement which speaks of a solution 
that protects Sikhs' rights. It should be abundantly clear to 
USA and, indeed, rest of the civilized world, that India's 
commitment to human rights and democracy is axiomatic [as heard] 
to India's existence. At the same time, this country does not 
accept external prescriptions in this regard. India hopes that 
the United States, as another democracy, will value India's 
policy of secularism and democracy and make more positive moves 
in the context of India's amiable and meaningful relations. 
[sentence as heard] 
  Happily, India has appreciated the economic and political 
stability in today's world as a driving force in international 
relations. India has responded remarkably to the increasing 
globalization of economic process through a wide-ranging program 
of economic reforms. In a short period of about two and half 
years, major reforms have been undertaken in industrial policy, 
foreign trade and exchange rate policies, taxation policies, and 
the financial sector. The basic medium-term objective of these 
policies is to lay the foundation for sustained growth of output 
and employment in the context of increasing global 
competitiveness of the Indian economy. The country is expected 
to receive around $2 billion in nondebt-creating flows of 
foreign investment this year. Equity issues abroad by Indian 
companies have been highly successful. This year, agriculture 
is expected to receive 2 to 3 percent growth. Interestingly, a 
U.S.-based economic forecasting company, the (?Wharton) Economic 
Forecasting Association, WEFA, has projected India's real GDP 
[gross domestic product] to grow by 5.6 percent in 1994. With 
an increase in net exports and agricultural incomes, the growth 
is predicted to be 6.1 percent in 1995. These projections are 
based on the findings of a study that merchandise exports will 
rise by 18.6 percent in 1993.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "New Agenda on Arm-Twisting"] </F>
  [Text] In a joint statement on nuclear non-proliferation, 
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have asked India and 
Pakistan to be a part of the multilateral talks aimed at 
"transforming the subcontinent into a nuclear-free zone". While 
Mr. Clinton's crusading zeal to keep Asia tethered on the other 
side of the nuclear divide is old hat, the surprise package is 
Mr. Yeltsin's adoption of Mr. Clinton's preachy role -- to India 
and Pakistan -- on missile and nuclear non-proliferation. No 
doubt, Mr. Yeltsin is toeing the American line, but it is 
totally at variance -- therefore, the surprise -- with the more 
guardedly prudent stand of the former Soviet Union, which had 
not publicly joined the London Club on the nuclear issue. And, 
therefore, tactfully avoided pressing India too hard on the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty] issue. Mr. Yeltsin apparently has no 
such compunctions in joining the Big-League in its 
discriminatory attitude of keeping the Third World away from 
nuclear technology. India's reluctance to do so is a morally 
justifiable one. While she has not balked at the prospect of a 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty coming into force in 1996, India 
has taken exception to the regional pressure that is being 
applied on her to accept the NPT, or its regional variation 
cobbled together by Islamabad and Washington. The position 
taken by the presidents of America and Russia makes little sense 
if the nuclear weapons powers continue to exercise their 
prerogative of testing and developing their nuclear arsenals. A 
vapid declaration of "no first use" sounds even sillier, if also 
discriminatory, when the U.S. in particular laughs at any 
suggestion of a global ban on nuclear testing as a first step 
towards eliminating all nuclear weapons. The "have's", it would 
appear, are not so susceptible to U.S. pressures on nuclear 
disarmament, and can with impunity cock a snook at Uncle Sam's 
vain glorious threats of applying economic sanctions on those 
found guilty of testing. China exploded her nuclear device with 
aplomb; and North Korea unequivocally showed that "tough 
measures" just would not work. But what of the U.S. indulgences 
that have been responsible for furnishing Israel's "clandestine 
nuclear arsenal," and of overlooking Pakistan's boast of 
possessing military nuclear capability? Mr. Clinton and Mr. 
Yeltsin would do well to desist from feeding us such pious 
homilies on NPT, and revise their opinions on what India should, 
or should not, do. India's security imperatives -- surrounded as 
she is with nuclear warheads cutting a wide swathe from the 
Central Asian Republics to the Indian Ocean and eastwards in 
China -- demand a certain policy. There should be global action 
for the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Pakistan's premier 
Benazir Bhutto has said that her country will not roll back its 
nuclear programme "under any circumstances". Surely, there is a 
limit to which India can be pushed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Shift in Russia's Stand on the Kashmir Issue"] </F>
  [Text] The revelation by a leading Indian daily, THE 
HINDU, that Russian President Yeltsin has recently written a 
letter to Narasimha Rao, expressing concern over the violations 
of human rights in occupied Kashmir and calling on India to find 
a just solution to the Kashmir problem reflects a shift in 
Moscow's stand on the Kashmir issue. Even the souls of Hitler 
and Mussolini are feeling ashamed of the manner in which the 
Indian security forces have been carrying out the heinous and 
appalling crimes in the savage massacres of the Kashmiris 
including children, burning their homes, and gang-raping women 
on the pretext of their being connected with the Hizbul 
Mojahedin and the Movement for the Freedom of Kashmir 
organizations. India has done as much as it could to cover up 
these brutalities by carrying out anti-Pakistan propaganda, but 
Western countries and the international human rights 
organizations have now become fully aware of the actual 
situation and have been voicing strong protests against the 
gross violation of human rights in occupied Kashmir. Lately, 
besides Asia Watch and Amnesty International, several members of 
the British Parliament and prominent Indian parliamentarian 
Indrajit Gupta have also joined these protests; and the Indian 
Government, after getting tired of this situation, has flatly 
refused to allow a delegation of the Amnesty International to 
visit occupied Kashmir. 
  Under these circumstances, the advice from India's old ally 
-- a staunch supporter of New Delhi on the Kashmir issue in the 
past -- to find a just solution to the Kashmir dispute reflects 
the increasing awareness and concern in the entire world for an 
early resolution of this issue. India will not be able to 
counter these pressures for long and will, therefore, be forced 
to settle the problem in accordance with the wishes of the 
Kashmiri people and the relevant resolutions of the United 
Nations. Considering this situation as a good augury, Pakistan 
will have to further intensify its struggle to fully apprise the 
international public opinion of its stand on Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Don't Preach to Pakistan About Refugees' </F>
Rights"] 
  [Text] Amnesty International has come out with a report 
strongly critical of Paksitan's closing of its borders with 
Afghanistan. The human rights organisation feels that there is 
no justification for preventing the right of people to seek 
asylum, particularly at such a crucial time when renewed fierce 
fighting in Kabul has forced thousands to flee to safer areas. 
A BBC report on Saturday [22 Jan] painted Pakistan as a villain 
in this regard, and even played up differences between the 
federal and NWFP governments over the issue. At the same time 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has 
also urged Islamabad to reopen the border, saying that the 
policy would create difficulties for refugees. Thousands have 
been turned back from the Torkhum border, the main entry into 
Pakistan for those fleeing the Kabul fighting. 
  The first impulse is to lash back at these self-righteous 
international organisations for preaching to us about refugees 
rights, when the western countries of their origin have 
themselves repeatedly ignored all such concepts of international 
responsibility. Pakistan has a much better track record of 
hospitality and sensitivity than any other sovereign nation, 
having hosted over three million Afghans for over a decade since 
the Afghan war started. Yet when the Russians were thrown out, 
and the Cold War came to an end, suddenly everyone lost interest 
in Afghanistan, at one time the front line in the war against 
communism. More than a million refugees are still in Pakistan, 
but international agencies and countries had washed their hands 
of the problem much before this latest round of internecine 
fighting. Despite repeated requests for aid and rehabilitation 
funds, Pakistan has found itself increasingly taking on the 
entire burden of a refugee problem for which the blame lies as 
much on the West as it does on the former Soviet Union. 
  Then, there is no reason to criticise Pakistan as if it is 
committing some sort of heinous human rights violation. The 
stand of the Pakistani government is quite valid that since 
fighting has been thus far limited to only Kabul and a few 
adjoining areas, there is no reason why refugees cannot be 
shifted to other places in Afghanistan which are otherwise 
untouched by the fighting. Leaving aside the fact that Afghans 
have begun to find it more convenient to jump across the border 
than find shelter in other parts of their country, Pakistan has 
not left the refugees to fend for themselves -- camps are being 
set up inside Afghan territory, and Pakistan has committed a 
substantial amount of relief aid to the effort to feed and 
shelter the needy refugees. As for the right of asylum, there 
is no law that says that a country should open the floodgates in 
a situation such as the one Pakistan is faced with. The US 
wasn't willing to take on even a few thousand Haitian refugees, 
preferring to keep them at sea or forcibly returning them to 
their homeland, where chances of persecution were much higher 
than in Afghanistan. That was criminal. A decade of experience 
with the Afghan refugees has shown us at least this much that 
when dealing with the kinds of numbers as in this scenario, it 
is hard to distinguish the persecuted from the needy. Perhaps 
UNHCR could set up an appropriate office in the refugee camps in 
Afghan territory, and then see how many other countries are 
willing to accept asylum seekers from among the applicants they 
get. With the kinds of laws adopted by many European countries 
regarding asylum, it seems unlikely that there will be many. 
  Instead of preaching to Pakistan about standards of 
responsibility that we know better about, AI should concentrate 
on urging the West to atone for its crimes against Afghanistan. 
When Amnesty accuses the warring parties in Afghanistan of 
using civilians as human shields, does it forget that this is 
only a natural continuation of the policies of the superpowers 
in their quest for global supremacy? Their violations of human 
rights are much more significant, yet all Amnesty has to say to 
them is: Please try to send some aid, if it's not too much of a 
bother. It's for a good cause. 
  We cannot afford to take on more refuges simply on the 
promises of the international agencies, because unless they can 
get other countries to pay their share. Pakistan will once 
again be left to absorb the costs into its own barely solvent 
economy. If the US can get the Gulf states to foot the bill for 
such a massively destructive war effort in Iraq, surely there is 
something available to use constructively for the Afghans. 
Amnesty International would do well to consider human rights on 
a macro rather than a micro level. Don't expect Third World 
countries to go out of their way if you can't even convince your 
own people to start taking responsibility for their doings and 
misdoings. 
  Notwithstanding this aspect of the Afghan Refugees' cases, 
our Interior Ministry needs to handle the issue with 
sensitivity. Eye witness accounts of arrival at Torkhum suggest 
insensitive handling of the policy laid down by Islamabad. 
There are reports of crying women and children at the barrier 
and of families who fled in such a hurry that they brought their 
dead. Some women have given birth waiting on the other side. 
The border guards enforced the rule that only those recommended 
by the Afghan authorities would be admitted. The Afghans with 
all their humanity burnt out by a long exposure to brutalities, 
recommended only those who could pay for their recommendation. 
The going rate was Rs 500/- [as published] per person. 
Pakistan rupee is hard currency in Afghanistan. It is 
difficult to suggest any foolproof method of verifying genuine 
hardship cases. But a few honest officers posted as assessors 
may help.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "President Clinton's Support for the Sikhs' </F>
Rights"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Clinton has supported the rights of 
the Indian Sikhs and stressed the need for a peaceful settlement 
of their problems. The Indian Government has strongly protested 
President Clinton's letter to the Khalistan Council and warned 
that the U.S. pronouncements may have a negative impact on 
bilateral relations. 
  The international community has now begun to feel strongly 
about the shameful treatment meted out to the non-Hindu 
minorities, especially the Muslims and the Sikhs, in India in 
the name of secularism. That is why the international media has 
started to focus attention on the armed struggle for freedom in 
occupied Kashmir and the repression against the Indian Sikhs, 
and a voice is also being raised in their favor at the 
international level. A handful of higher caste Hindus have made 
the lives of all non-Hindu minorities in India extremely 
difficult. 
  The Sikh minority had backed the Hindus in the struggle for 
independence and had rejected great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah's 
request for support to the Muslim League and his offer of a 
separate homeland for the Sikhs. They, however, realized their 
political mistake soon after independence. For the past 10 
years, the Indian Sikhs have been waging a struggle to establish 
an independent Khalistan state and, presently, there is not a 
single Sikh family in Indian Punjab from which at least one 
person has not been killed at the hands of the Indian forces and 
the police. The manner in which the sanctity of the holiest 
seat of the Sikh faith, the Golden Temple, was trampled upon 
during the Indira Gandhi regime is glaring proof of the 
prejudice of the Hindu mind against the holy places of the 
non-Hindu minorities. 
  The call made by President Clinton for a peaceful settlement 
of the issue of the Sikhs' independence is appropriate and 
justified in every respect. Besides the Sikhs, the Indian 
Muslims, the untouchables, the Nagas, and other oppressed 
sections also reserve the right to demand independence from 
India for their survival.

  [Text] Sirte, A'ina al-Nar [January] 26, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY -- 'Umar al-Muntasir, the secretary of the General 
People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Cooperation has said that the decisions taken by the basic 
people's committees relating to foreign policy were readily 
accepted despite the difficult political conditions which 
prevail in the world and the unjustly harsh blockade imposed on 
the Libyan people under the pretext of so- called "international 
legitimacy" which was exploited by the three Western countries 
for their own ends to undermine the great al-Fatih revolution. 
  In his response to the points concerning the matter of the 
Basic Peoples' Congresses yesterday evening, al-Muntasir said 
that the great al-Fatih revolution has the honour of 
confrontation and defiance to colonialist designs. 
  He said that attempts by the Western countries to undermine 
the Great Jamahiriyah had reached the degree of armed aggression 
against it and the bombing of the house of the leader of the 
revolution. When these countries failed in their attempts, they 
used the downing of a Pan Am airliner flight number 103 and a 
Uta airliner in another attempt to undermine the Great 
Jamahiriyah. 
  He said that at a time when the United States is in sole 
leading position over the world, the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, and the end of the Cold War, the Western powers used the 
Security Council and transformed the issue from a criminal one 
to a political one despite the fact that there is no evidence 
which shows that the Great Jamahiriyah is responsible for this 
act. He said that the Jamahiriyah attempted to seek a solution 
to this crisis, the need to find the truth, and to have a trial 
held in a neutral country but the three Western countries closed 
all the doors which shows that the main aim behind their actions 
is not to find the truth but to carry out their own political 
ends. 
  He added that the Great Jamahiriyah's stance in this crisis 
was well received and appreciated by more than two thirds of the 
countries of the world, including the countries of the Non 
Aligned Movement, the Islamic Conference Organisation, the Arab 
League and the Organisation of African Unity as well as several 
trade and other organisations, in addition to other countries. 
  This reflected itself in the Security Council when the vote 
was taken on three of the Western countries proposed resolutions 
and were extremely difficult to be approved, despite the strong 
pressure it applied and the threats and inducives [as received] 
it used.

<F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recordings of King </F>
Husayn's remarks in English] 
  [Excerpts] His Majesty King Husayn has met with William 
Perry, the U.S. secretary of defense designate, at the U.S. 
Pentagon. [passage omitted] 
  During His Majesty King Husayn's meeting with 
representatives 
of the Arab American societies, his majesty praised the efforts 
made by Arab Americans to promote and entrench a better 
understanding of current Arab issues: 
  [Begin King Husayn recording, in Arabic] I am extremely 
happy 
to have this opportunity to welcome the dear ones at this 
meeting. [end recording] 
  His majesty spoke about the successive developments in the 
region and the world, and about the world's recent focus on our 
region's issues. He stressed that Jordan has always been 
exerting efforts to achieve a lasting and comprehensive peace, 
and to arrive at a solution to the Palestine question, which is 
the crux of the conflict in the region. 
  "We have begun to address many elements there to see what 
progress, hopefully, we will make, because as far as a peace 
treaty is concerned, we feel that it comes at the end. It is a 
crowning achievement of resolving every problem that we have, 
and not before, as it has been suggested time and again. You do 
not ratify peace and then begin to negotiate the terms, the 
items, or the issues that have to be covered and addressed. 
And, obviously, we have always been committed to the cause of a 
just, comprehensive peace, that we hope and pray that we will 
see as a result of coordination and major efforts being made, 
and progress on all the other tracks as well, particularly as 
regards Syria and Lebanon together with Jordan as the 
Palestinian dimension moves on its own, again supported by 
everything we can give and do. So, we hope it will come 
together somehow. I have been very impressed during this visit, 
and throughout this past period by my contacts with the 
administration, particularly the President, by his being a man 
who has an interest, a concern, who seems to know all the 
details, and has come to know them in a very short space of time 
of his assuming responsibilities at a time when the United 
States has so much that it is involved with the world over. And 
I know that they are sincere and genuine in trying to help see 
us achieve an objective for future generations to live in peace 
and in security in the entire region. Today, I think is just a 
beginning of another phase of the negotiations. Let's hope that 
they are addressed seriously and with determination and 
goodwill. And let's hope that at the end of the day we can 
achieve our objective of a just, lasting, and comprehensive 
peace in our region, which would be our legacy that we will 
leave for future generations to enjoy beyond us." 
  His majesty answered the audience's questions which focused 
on Jordan's role in the region and the world. 
  "Beyond that, Jordan in the region is trying to work to 
bring 
the Arab world together again, hopefully, and this time, 
hopefully, on strong foundations that can last in the future of 
trust, and confidence, and cooperation. It's moving in the 
right direction. We may not always be very popular as regards 
democracy, or understood. We have a free press, a free 
press--you know what it means here, and it causes me some 
headaches as well, but this is our way. This may not be 
understood by all. I don't think that democracy is a threat. 
It should be a source of strength, and I hope that the example 
itself will, in time, be such as to convince our other brethren 
that this is the only way, that people have to share in shaping 
their future, that they will, God willing. 
  "And therefore, we will have the kind of world that it is 
our duty to try to create for generations to come. So, it is a 
difficult moment. 
  "On another level, we are involved in, practically all the 
UN 
peacekeeping missions in the world. And we are happy that we 
are a corner of stability in the region, but we are also playing 
our role to the best of our ability elsewhere. In the former 
Yugoslavia, we are building up to over 3,000 Jordanian troops 
now with the United Nations. And we have been in four other 
areas as well." 
  Regarding what Jordan hopes from the ongoing Arab-Israeli 
peace talks in Washington, King Husayn said: 
  "So we are talking about the delineation and the demarcation 
of these territories, the setting up of a group to deal with 
that as it affects Jordan in terms of the area. Mainly we have 
a small problem in the north, but we are talking about an area 
from the Dead Sea to al-'Aqabah. And our position is very, very 
clear against any possible suggestion of: Can Jordan lease 
land, we can't lease land. This was occupied after '67 by 
creeping movement under the guise of security or whatever. It 
is quite a sizeable piece of land. So, we want to settle that, 
that to revert to our sovereignty, and that beyond that when 
that is certain we can look at the whole rift valley as an 
economic unit and then see exactly what can be done. Sovereignty 
over our territories is one of the essential parts to begin with. 
  "We have the question of water, that is a very, very 
important element as well. We have to decide, all of us, 
exactly what are the rights of all to whatever resources are 
available. We believe that all the resources that are available 
are short of what is needed in a very short space of time. 
Obviously, in a context of peace, we can find other sources in 
the future, but we have to establish exactly what these rights 
are right now, so that we can move ahead. 
  "And the third element obviously has to do with people and 
their rights, including the question of the reunification of 
families. We still have so many people that have the right to 
return legally and are still unable to do so, who have left from 
time to time, over the years. And I hope that this will be 
addressed as well. Beyond that, obviously we will look at the 
bigger picture regarding the future with all its dimensions, 
economic or otherwise." 
  Answering a question about the idea of forming a 
Jordanian-American business council -- which was proposed by his 
royal highness the crown prince during his recent visit to the 
United States -- his majesty welcomed this initiative saying: 
  "As far the Jordanian-American business council, we've heard 
about it, and I've endorsed it and I'm fully supportive of it. 
And also the elements of what you've put across, sir, we're 
perfectly ready and happy." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri will leave London 
this morning and will make a short stopover at Istanbul airport 
where he will hold talks with the Turkish prime minister on 
issues of common concern that were raised during his recent 
visit to Turkey. The prime minister and his delegation will 
then visit al-Qardahah in Syria to offer condolences to 
President Hafiz al-Asad on the death of his son Staff Major 
Basil al-Asad. 
  Last night, Prime Minister al-Hariri addressed the alumni of 
the American University of Beirut-London branch. The prime 
minister dealt with the current situation and the Lebanese 
Government's stances and plans to reconstruct Lebanon. He 
reiterated that his visit to London has been successful, noting 
that British companies will contribute toward reconstructing 
Lebanon. Prime Minister al-Hariri had the following to say: 
  [Begin al-Hariri recording] I believe that our visit to 
Britain was successful and the outcome exceeds our expectations. 
It had been a long time since a Lebanese prime minister visited 
Britain, but the atmosphere of frankness and amity that 
prevailed during our talks with British officials demonstrate 
[words indistinct]. I firmly believe that a new page has been 
turned in Lebanese-British relations. 
  British companies will take part in the reconstruction of 
Lebanon, particularly in the realms of electricity and 
irrigation. British companies could possibly participate in any 
project if their quotations are competitive. The British 
Government supports this trend. During my meetings with British 
businessmen yesterday and today I sensed that they are quite 
serious, that they respect the Lebanese people, and that they 
have confidence in Lebanon. We will benefit from their 
expertise and they will benefit from the opportunities. 
  Britain is a friendly state. It fully supports Security 
Council Resolution 425, Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon, 
and the establishment of peace -- a comprehensive and just peace 
that safeguards dignity and honor. [sentence indistinct] We 
have many friends in the world, and all our friends support us. 
We hope to secure an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and that 
peace will prevail in the region. 
  If Israel indeed wants to live in peace, the Arabs, all the 
Arabs, are quite prepared to reciprocate. The Arabs are indeed 
willing to live in peace. [Words indistinct] but Israel must 
realize that it cannot keep the land, occupy the land, and have 
peace too. If Israel wants peace, it must withdraw from the 
land in the Golan and south Lebanon. 
  The ball is now in Israel's court. The Arabs have tried 
everything to show the world that they are peace advocates. The 
world has started to listen to us with open minds. Lebanon, 
like the other states in the region, will benefit from peace, 
therefore peace is our real objective. Peace, however, should 
not be made by one side; it must rather be sought by both sides. 
The Israelis are attacking us every day and 10 percent of our 
land is occupied. Israel must withdraw and peace will then be 
established. [end recording]

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani received Tajik Foreign 
Minister Rashid Olimov today, who conveyed a message from the 
president of Tajikistan. 
  In this meeting, which was also attended by Foreign Minister 
Velayati, Tajikistan's foreign minister conveyed the very 
sincere greetings of Tajik President Rakhmanov and handed his 
written message to the president. Submitting a report about the 
latest developments in Tajikistan, the Tajik foreign minister 
informed the president of the decision of the Tajik Government 
about the holding of general elections and the establishment of 
peace and stability in that country. 
  Olimov stressed that the Tajik nation and government have 
enormous respect and affection for the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and hope that, with the help of the friends of 
Tajikistan--especially Iran--they will witness national 
reconciliation and peace and security in Tajikistan in the near 
future. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani then expressed his thanks for 
the kind message of the Tajik president and welcomed the 
decision of that government to bring about national 
reconciliation and an end to internal clashes. He said: The 
only solution for the well-being of the people of Tajikistan is 
in cooperation, national reconciliation, and solidarity. 
Clashes, fighting, and ignoring a section of the society will 
produce no benefits and will result in the destruction of 
national capabilities. No one will benefit from it. We hope 
that we will be able to witness the return of calm and stability 
to Tajikistan as soon as possible, and we are prepared to help 
you achieve this goal.

  [Excerpt] A Military correspondent of the Bakhtar

Brigade associated with Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan] called the unholy alliance of Golboddin with Dostam 
and Karmal a treacherous and anti-Islamic act. He cut off links 
with Golboddin's militia and joined [words indistinct] in 
Baghlan Province along with 500 people and 50 pieces of heavy 
weapons. Mulla Abdurrahim, commander Abdol Wali, commander 
Jalal, commander Mirza Rahim and commander Abdol Hanan are among 
those who have joined the jihad. These commanders have severed 
their links with Golboddin's militia and play their Islamic role 
on the side of the Islamic army's forces and mojahedin in the 
war of right against wrong. As many as 100 armed men of Unit 
10 under the command of Mohammadollah Nader in Poza-e Eshan in 
Baghlan Province have joined Jihadi Division 20. According to a 
report by correspondent of Bakhtar Information Agency, the unit 
was associated with Brigade 4 of the anti-Islamic Movement of 
Kamal-Dostam militia. They have joined the Islamic army 
voluntarily in order to take part in the crushing of the enemies 
of Islam. Mohammadollah Nader, commander of the unit, in a 
speech said: For the independence of the country and for jihad 
and campaign against the enemies of Islam, Karmal, Dostam and 
Golboddin, we are ready for self-sacrifice. [passage omitted]

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Police scattered 
thousands of demonstrators who broke through steel barricades 
and tried to head for the US Embassy here on Thursday [27 Jan] 
to protest alleged US meddling in Indian affairs. 
  Flag-waving, slogan-chanting activists of the youth wing of 
India's ruling Congress (I) party took part in the 
demonstration, which police stopped on an avenue leading to the 
mission, witnesses said. 
  The police sprayed the protesters with water cannon when 
they 
knocked down barricades. Some demonstrators were physically 
lifted and flung back but no one was seriously injured. 
  The clash came after a small Youth Congress (I) delegation 
left for the US Embassy with police permission to present a 
letter of protest to the mission, located in the high-security 
diplomatic enclave. 
  "Bill Clinton, down down," chanted the estimated 3,500 
demonstrators who gathered on a call by Maninder Singh Bitta, a 
Sikh politician and Youth Congress president. "America, come to 
your senses," they shouted. 
  The protest was provoked by a letter written by the US 
president to a group of US Congressman who sought US 
intervention to stop alleged human rights abuses by police 
battling a waning Sikh militancy in India's Punjab state. 
  Clinton said in the letter that he wanted a "peaceful 
solution that protected Sikh rights" in Punjab, where "abuses 
still occur." 
  The Youth Congress leader denounced "constant meddling" by 
Washington in the internal affairs of India, noting US 
utterances on alleged human rights abuses in Kashmir as well. 
  Bitta, who last year survived an attempted assassination by 
Sikh militants, said the United States had tended to "totally 
gloss over the issue of terrorism" while voicing concern for 
human rights. 
  Clinton's concern was unwarranted because "Punjab is 
witnessing peace and prosperity again after a decade of 
terrorist violence" and the Indian constitution protects the 
rights of all religious minorities, he said. 
  Sikh separatist lobbies are active in the United States, 
campaigning for Congressional support for their cause and 
helping fund the Punjab militants. 
  Separatist violence in the rich farming state has fallen 
dramatically over the past year, with hundreds of militants 
killed or captured.

  [Text] Pakistan will continue its international efforts to 
apprise the world of the Kashmir issue and to resolve it. At a 
news conference in New York, United Nations Representative 
Jamshed Marker said Pakistan's distinct success at the UN last 
year was that it was able to bring the Kashmir issue before the 
international community. Marker referred to President Clinton's 
address at the UN in September last year, in which he made a 
special reference to the Kashmir issue. He said India agreed to 
begin talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue due to 
international presssure and this pressure continues. Marker 
said despite India's attempts to conceal the atrocities of its 
troops, the international community has come to know more about 
Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Comment by 'Ali Musri al-Sha'iri, Secretary of the General </F>
People's Congress for Information and Culture, at a debate on 
the General People's Committee for Information and Culture; 
place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Praise be to God for the state of our people now 
as a result of the great 1 September revolution and its leader 
who is not interested in power and who has been leading the 
struggle for people to assume power; praise be to God that the 
people has become a master on this part of our Arab homeland and 
the world around us; praise be to God that the people has become 
awesome because it has the final say. 
  The questioning that is taking place in this hall is the 
pinnacle of the exercising of people's democracy. It is not 
aimed at individuals; it is aimed at assessing the performance 
of individuals and their commitment to the resolutions of basic 
people's congresses, their ability to implement them even under 
the most difficult circumstances and the extent of their ability 
to transform revolutionary instructions into practical plans to 
be implemented. [passage omitted: more on the people's right to 
choose officials; shouts slogans in praise of the revolution, 
people's authority and al-Qadhdhafi] 
  Undoubtedly, this gathering is full of cadres ['anasir] whom 
I believe to be more capable than myself and others to shoulder 
the responsibility for this sector, particularly at this phase 
in view of it being a frontline detachment in the battle of 
preaching and defending the great fatih [1 September] 
revolution; the revolution of the new civilization [interrupted 
by slogans; asks to be given a minute]. 
  I leave this position for those who are more capable of 
assuming this duty. I stress that it would be death without the 
revolution and its leader and the people's authority. This is a 
pledge I will not betray, a promise I will not break, and a 
principle I will not deviate from as long as there is a drop of 
blood flowing in my veins. Forward and the revolutionary 
struggle continues. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 27 (AFP)--Foreign ministers of the 
10-member Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO), winding up a 
meeting in Tehran on Thursday [27 January] search for ways of 
ending the civil war in Afghanistan which they consider a threat 
to the region. 
  The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and 
was expanded in 1991 to include Afghanistan as well as the 
former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, 
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. 
  On the sidelines of the two-day meeting, organised to 
discuss 
economic cooperation, the ministers of 10 Muslim countries in 
the region put forward several "practical proposals" to help end 
the conflict, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati said. 
  Speaking to reporters, Velayati acknowledged the difficult 
task of restoring peace to Afghanistan, but added that Iran and 
other countries in the region "were determined to continue their 
search." He declined to explain what the "practical proposals" 
were. 
  Several participants in the meeting revealed that "a certain 
number of ideas" have been put foreward by the ministers, among 
which is establishment of a regional conference under the 
auspices of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), 
which comprises 50 Muslim countries. 
  The OIC's Secretary General Hamid al-Qabid, who took part in 
the seminar, said an OIC delegation was currently in the Afghan 
capital to try and secure a ceasefire. 
  He said that he would himself go to Kabul if asked to start 
mediation among rival Afghan forces. 
  Qabid told AFP that the accord reached between the factions 
in Islamabad last spring, at the prodding of Pakistan and Saudi 
Arabia, was no longer effective but could be used as "a basis 
for future discussions". 
  Afghan Foreign Minister Hedayat Amin Arsala told AFP that he 
favored a comprehensive solution searched for by the United 
Nations or OIC rather than mediation efforts undertaken by 
Afghanistan's neighbors, whose "objectives are not clear so far." 
  "After all, finding a solution is primarily the 
responsibility of Afghans themselves," he said. 
  The ministers also addressed other regional crises, namely 
the civil war in Tajikistan between the pro-communist government 
and the Islamic opposition, as well as the Armenian-Azeri 
conflict. 
  Azerbaijan did not appear to have gathered the solid support 
it expected in a bid to impose widespread economic sanctions 
against Armenia, according to participants. 
  The Tajik minister, for his part, categotically rejected 
mediation offers by several ECO members, saying his country 
prefered wider efforts undertaken by the United Nations. 
  On the economic front, the countries agreed to cooperate on 
setting up a regional trade and development bank, establishing 
insurance links and creating a joint airline and shipping 
company. 
  Cooperation in transportation and communication were also 
given priority during the conference, as many of the ECO member 
states are land-locked and need access to the sea and outside 
world, Velayati said. 
  The ministers also discussed cooperation between the ECO and 
several international organisations. Memorandums of 
understanding were signed Tuesday between the ECO and the United 
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as well as United Nations 
Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO).

  [Text] [no dateline as received] Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani appealed to the former Soviet republics of 
Central Asia to keep their distance from the West and "make 
their own decisions about their plight" at a meeting of the 
foreign ministers of the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] 
member-countries, which took place at the Iranian capital. This 
regional organization originally included Iran, Turkey, and 
Pakistan, but in 1992 Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan joined it. 
  According to the president, the United States and Europe are 
not interested in the settlement of conflicts that are taking 
place in the young states of the region and might even foment 
them. He said: "Unfortunately, the colonial powers do not pay 
attention to those ruinous conflicts in the `Third World' that 
do not involve their interests. In some cases they even fan the 
flames of these conflicts in order to reach their diabolic 
objectives and ensure their illegal interests." 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani indicated the urgent necessity of close 
cooperation of the ECO member-countries that are rich in natural 
and labor resources. "It is absolutely evident that this 
cooperation will reduce our economic dependence on the developed 
countries" and will decrease the political tension in the 
region, the president stressed.

<F P=106> [Video report by Washington correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At the Washington talks, the 
major development so far has been the positive atmosphere and 
the initial, albeit hesitant, discussion of substantive issues. 
Thus, for example, Itamar Rabinovich and Muwaffaq al-'Allaf 
briefly touched on the issue of principles of security on the 
Golan Heights. Rabinovich suggested that the two men discuss the 
issue as though an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights had 
already been decided upon. The Syrian negotiator did not rule 
out the proposal but has so far refused to hold an open and 
detailed debate on the issue. 
  Meanwhile, the talks on the Syrian, Lebanese, and 
Palestinian 
tracks are being conducted between the heads of the delegations. 
It remains unclear whether the expanded delegations will meet 
next week. 
  In the meantime, not only King Husayn but also Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Jasim, the Qatari foreign minister, took some brave steps 
toward reconciliation with Israel. He admitted tonight that 
Qatar was holding trade negotiations with Israel on a large gas 
deal; however, the foreign minister clearly explained to us this 
evening that a signed agreement was still a long way off. 
  [Begin Bin-Jasim recording, in English] When we see some 
advance in the negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, we will take 
our own action with the second and the third boycott. And about 
the first boycott, it will have to be taken through the Arab 
league. [end recording] 
  The minister promised that the Israelis arriving in Qatar 
for 
the multilateral talks in April would receive a warm welcome. 
  [Begin Bin-Jasim recording, in English] And I think our 
people will accept our move and they will even defend the case 
by themselves. [end recording] 
  The heads of the Syrian and Israeli delegations have also 
agreed about the definition of the proposed demilitarization of 
the Golan Heights. This will be a balanced demilitarization 
that will not obligate Israel to demilitarize large areas of the 
Galilee in exchange for the demilitarization of the Golan 
Heights.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators held a fourth round of talks at 1100 today to 
resolve the differences between them. The differences continue 
to stall the implementation of the autonomy agreement in Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  The Palestinian delegation to the talks, headed by Ahmad 
Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', the head of the PLO's Economic 
Department, comprises Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, and Palestinian Ambassador in 
Cairo Sa'id Kamal. 
  The Israeli delegation is headed by Uri Savir, director 
general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and comprises Uzi 
Dayan, political planning director at the Ministry, and Yo'el 
Singer, legal adviser at the Foreign Ministry. 
  The two delegations have held four sessions since the 
Israeli 
delegation arrived in Cairo. One session took place at 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's residence in the 
al-Andalus Palace in Heliopolis. 
  Sources from the Palestinian delegation told MENA that the 
basic points of difference still revolve around the issue of 
security control over the crossings into Jordan from Jericho and 
into Egyptian Rafah from the Gaza Strip. Israel rejects a 
noticeable Palestinian security presence on the King Husayn 
Bridge--the Allenby Bridge--crossing into Jordan. 
  The same sources said that Israel is demanding its own 
security presence to observe people traveling to the autonomy 
region even if Palestinian-Israeli agreement is reached on an 
Israeli security presence in which Israeli security men are 
hidden behind a screen and won't be obvious. 
  The same sources noted that the negotiations to have the 
Israelis accept the symbols of Palestinian sovereignty over the 
autonomy areas have finally culminated in Israel accepting the 
Palestinian flag being hoisted over the special crossing for 
travelers to and from the autonomy region. 
  As for the Jericho region, the same sources clarified that 
Israel still refuses to hand over power to a Palestinian 
autonomy to administratively control the areas of Jabal 
al-Qarantal and al-Maghtis on the River Jordan. It only allows 
religious control during religious celebrations. Israel also 
refuses to place the area of Maqam al-Nabi Musa, which falls on 
the main Jerusalem road, under Palestinian control. 
  The current Palestinian-Israeli round of talks is expected 
to 
end at around 1400 today and resume its meetings later in the 
afternoon. 
  The same Palestinian sources also said in a statement today 
that the points they will reach agreement on during this round 
of talks, which is considered an attempt to support the 
negotiations and propel them forward, will be presented to 
president 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
during their meeting on Saturday evening in Davos, Switzerland, 
on the sidelines of the international economic forum that starts 
its meetings there today.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian Ambassador in 
Cairo Sa'id Kamal has said that during their meeting this 
morning Palestinian and Israeli negotiators for the first time 
reached a formula listing points of difference and points of 
agreement in the disputed issues of border crossings and the 
size of the Israeli withdrawal from Jericho. 
  He said the negotiations, which continued over six long 
sessions, identified 12 points of difference. These are now 
being worded to be presented to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres before their 
upcoming meeting in the Swiss city of Davos Saturday [29 
January] night and Sunday on the sidelines of the World Economic 
Forum. 
  If 'Arafat and Peres reach an agreement on those points, 
Kamal added, a committee will meet in Taba next week to work out 
the final wording of a protocol on the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, to be signed by 'Arafat and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, so that there will be a complete 
Israeli withdrawal before 13 April in accordance with the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  MENA has learned that the formula includes an agreement to 
raise the Palestinian flag outside the administration building 
that will control the border crossings. Other points are: No 
Palestinian security man in military uniform shall be seen on 
the same crossing leading to King Husayn (Allenby) Bridge. The 
Israeli security man watching arrivals in the Palestinian 
autonomous region of Gaza and Jericho shall stay inside the 
building behind a dark glass barrier. 
  The Israelis agreed that the arrivals be inspected 
electronically. In case of suspicion, however, anyone can be 
inspected by Palestinian security men while the Israelis watch. 
  Some differences remain. The Palestinians want Israel to 
give the self-rule authority administrative as well as religious 
supervision over the areas of Jabal al-Qarantal and al-Maghtis 
on the River Jordan and Maqam al-Nabi Musa on the main road to 
Jerusalem. 
  The Israeli delegation will leave Cairo later today 
immediately after the working session, which is scheduled to 
last until evening.

  [Text] Cairo, Jan 28 (AFP)--Israel and the PLO failed to 
make sufficient progress toward launching Palestinian self-rule 
at negotiations here this week, PLO chief negotiator Nabil 
Sha'th said Friday [28 January] on the eve of crucial talks in 
Switzerland. 
  "Some progress was certainly made during 36 hours of 
negotiations, but it was insufficient," Sha'th told AFP. 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres are due to meet in Davos, Switzerland, on Saturday in a 
new effort to break the deadlock. They will examine 12 points 
of disagreement drawn up by the negotiators. 
  Stressing the Palestine Liberation Organisation's 
"attachment" to the autonomy accord signed in Washington on 
September 13, Sha'th said the PLO "insists that the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho ends on the date set by the 
accord" -- April 13. 
  "We will not accept any delay," Sha'th added. 
  Israeli troops were to have begun withdrawing on December 
13. 
  Sha'th said he would attend the Davos talks with PLO 
economic 
department chief Ahmad Quray' (Abu-al-'Ala'). 
  The two sides are trying to resolve differences over control 
of border crossings and the size of the future autonomous 
Jericho area in the West Bank. 
  The PLO representative in Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, said that if 
'Arafat and Peres ironed out the differences in Davos, 
negotiators would meet in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba to 
prepare the text of an agreement. 
  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin would then 
sign the agreement, he added. 
  However in Jerusalem, Peres said Israel and the PLO still 
had 
much work to do before launching Palestinian self-rule. 
  "Although I am generally an optimist I cannot promise that 
an 
accord will be reached in Davos," Peres said before leaving.

<F P=106> ['Abd-al-Rahman al-Rashid article: "'Arafat and the Lesson </F>
of the Gulf"] 
  [Text] There was a distinct air of anticipation as 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat met with Custodian of the 
Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz in Riyadh. As 
everyone knows, the significance of that meeting stems from the 
fact that it was the first meeting after the three-year official 
boycott between the two sides as a result of the position taken 
by the PLO in support and in defense of the Iraqi occupation of 
Kuwait. 
  As the announcement is made of the closure of the dispute 
file, it is wise to talk about ways of maintaining special 
relations which could deteriorate if not kept at the right 
temperature. 
  The golden advice given to the PLO at the beginning of the 
crisis after Iraq occupied an entire country and displaced its 
people in a serious precedent, still stands. It is that the PLO 
should adopt one of two lines: Adhere to the Arab League's 
bylaws which condemn such acts, or take a neutral stand and 
choose isolation that would spare it embarrassment. 
  One could understand the Sudanese president standing up and 
insulting an afflicted fraternal state at the summit conference 
held in Cairo after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, for the Sudanese 
Government was then and is now a military government whose hands 
were smeared in blood of the coup which toppled a civilian 
government not long before that. At that conference, the 
Sudanese president deliberately ignored the legitimate call by 
Kuwait and nine other Arab states for the condemnation of the 
occupation in principle and for an end to that occupation, and 
instead called for the formation of a committee to study the 
matter and to visit Baghdad (?), finding the condemnation call 
too much. One could understand this, coming from a man whose 
action in his own country was equal to the Iraqi president's 
crime, but 'Arafat committed an even worse act when he raised 
his hand in support of the Sudanese request, to the amazement of 
the majority. But in 'Arafat's case, his [Palestinian] 
territory is occupied and his people displaced. Before anyone 
else, he should have immediately condemned the occupation 
instead of supporting the call for the formation of a committee 
to study the matter. No Arab had called for the formation of a 
committee before Israel was condemned. 
  This is not the day of reckoning but the PLO might find 
itself in similar difficult political situations in the future, 
whether after it has its own state on its own territory or while 
still an airborne government, as the Libyan leader calls it. If 
the PLO has complex interests it fears for, the least it can do 
in such a case is to take a neutral stand, the best known 
diplomatic invention in politics. 
  The PLO lost its honor, its resources, and many friends in 
that crisis and the situation reached a dangerous point for the 
Palestinian cause because of the PLO's impartiality. Now it is 
urged to stay out of the whirlpool of regional alliances because 
it is the only party whose cause everyone has agreed to support.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 27 Jan (MENA)--Information Minister 
Safwat al-Sharif has stated that President Husni Mubarak 
discussed a number of issues, including terrorism, corruption, 
freedom of opinion, the housing law, and the national dialogue 
issue during his meeting today with writers, thinkers, and 
intellectuals. 
  President Mubarak also listened to a large number of 
intellectuals, thinkers, and opinion makers about their concepts 
of these problems and issues, both at the internal and external 
policy levels. They also discussed the cultural challenge under 
peace, the national dialogue, and the various problems facing 
books and the theater. The president emphasized a number of 
issues and principles during this dialogue. 
  President Mubarak also stressed his pledge to respect the 
law 
and Constitution without resorting to any emergency measure in 
the confrontation with terrorism, even though that means that it 
might take longer to eliminate terrorism. 
  The information minister added that President Mubarak also 
stressed that corruption is not being covered up, saying that 
every such case is referred to the courts for investigation. He 
said that not a single case of corruption is covered up by the 
state; on the contrary, the government has always taken the 
initiative in following up and exposing such cases and referring 
them to the judiciary. 
  The president stressed that every person who indulges in 
corruption is brought to account and tried so that others will 
be deterred. He said: We should respect the values of 
publication and not belittle or insult ourselves. 
  The information minister went on to say that, on the issue 
of 
freedom of opinion, President Mubarak stressed that there is no 
confiscation of an opinion, idea, or book. He said: We will 
not permit the confiscation or the recollection from markets of 
a book because of an administrative decision made by an 
establishment or government department. 
  The president also stressed that the housing law will not be 
referred to the People's Assembly until after an exhaustive 
discussion and debate, adding that there will be no law that 
harms the sons of society. He said: Up to this minute, no 
draft law has been prepared. All we have are studies and views 
on this subject. 
  The president called for setting up a higher specialized 
committee that includes experts in civil planning and housing to 
draw up the plan for tackling the issue of slums all over the 
republic. 
  On the issue of the national dialogue, which he has called 
for, the president stressed that the dialogue's objective is 
Egypt's present and future, adding that it will include all the 
political parties, national forums, intellectuals, thinkers, 
experts, and specialists. 
  President Mubarak added: This dialogue will have working 
papers that will be prepared before it starts. He proposed that 
the dialogue start on 1 April. 
  The information minister said that the president emphasized 
his responsibility to protect the security of Egypt and its sons 
and to achieve stability on its land, noting that there is a red 
line that no human being or group is allowed to cross. 
  President Mubarak stressed that the achievement of a just 
peace in the region will lead to the development of a better 
life and to a rise in its sons' standard of living. He said 
that this can come only through the use of advanced technology 
and cooperation and coordination between the countries of the 
region. 
  President Mubarak affirmed that the emergency law will 
continue and that, with the ongoing acts of terrorism, drug 
trafficking, and unusual circumstances, it is impossible to 
change or abolish it. He noted that this law was passed to 
safeguard society and that it will not affect freedom of speech 
and of the press. 
  President Mubarak called on the government to reconsider 
certain laws to close loopholes regarding the illegal buildings 
and to deter violators. He stressed that buildings that have 
technically and structurally safe foundations will not be 
demolished. He requested that fines imposed on floors built in 
violation of the law be transferred to the popular housing fund. 
He said that expropriation of property should be partial and in 
accordance with a legal decision and verdict in favor of popular 
housing. 
  Al-Sharif noted that President Mubarak stressed that with 
peace Egypt is capable of dealing with the region with 
self-confidence to achieve progress and increase and improve 
production. 
  President Mubarak stated that he referred to the People's 
Assembly a bill requesting abrogation of the agreement of the 
Arab Cooperation Council [which includes Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, 
and Yemen]. President Mubarak ordered the formation of a 
tripartite committee of the ministers of information, culture, 
and education to meet monthly to coordinate efforts to educate 
and enlighten society. He requested that the government study 
the problem of books and their prices to ensure export and 
competition in foreign markets. He requested reducing customs 
fees on paper so that Egypt will retain its vanguard cultural 
standing. 
  Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak declared that Egypt 
will not sign the agreement banning the use of chemical weapons 
unless it is linked to banning the use of nuclear weapons. 
President Mubarak said that Egypt's stance is firm on this 
issue and it will not sign this agreement unless the other is 
signed. 
  President Mubarak stressed that national dialogue will 
involve all legal parties and national forces. He emphasized 
respect for the law and that there will be no dialogue with 
illegal groups. He said that the Constitution in Egypt bans the 
establishment of religious parties and that the experiments of 
Jordan and Algeria will not be repeated in Egypt. No one will 
impose a view on Egypt or its people in the name of religion. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, President Mubarak broached 
the issue of terrorism, stressing that it preoccupies every 
Egyptian citizen despite the fact that it is an international 
phenomenon. He noted that we see acts of violence taking place 
everyday worldwide. He said that despite this we will not be 
lenient in confronting terrorism and stopping bloodshed and its 
impact on stability and the people's wellbeing. He noted that 
terrorism can be ended in a short time but will require 
exceptional measures. He stressed that in its firm 
confrontation of terrorism, Egypt wants to entrench the 
supremacy of law and respect for the Constitution, although 
settling this phenomenon once and for all will take time. He 
said that we are determined to ensure respect for the law and 
the Constitution without taking any exceptional measures to 
confront terrorism. 
  President Mubarak said that certain people speak of human 
rights and defend the rights of those who commit crimes of 
terrorism, forgetting the rights of victims and the state's 
right to protect and ensure security for its people. He noted 
that there are forces and states seeking to harm Egypt's 
stability and that certain parties fund the fugitive criminals. 
These parties finance terrorists to commit their crimes 
thinking that they will escape law and justice. [passage 
omitted] 
  Dr. Muhammad 'Abdallah and Sakinah Fu'ad spoke at the 
meeting 
on Arab-Israeli cooperation and the importance for President 
Mubarak of having a cultural adviser. President Mubarak said 
that cooperation among the Arab countries of the region and 
Israel under peace is clear to Egypt, noting his country's 
initiative to achieve progress. He stressed that there is a need 
to give and to take to serve the region's people. He said: I 
do not agree that I should have a cultural adviser because the 
channel between myself and the intellectuals is always open. He 
said: I do not agree with the confiscation of books because the 
law regulates this issue. 
  Journalist Salah Hafiz spoke on cooperation between Egypt 
and 
Israel in the next stage. President Mubarak said that under 
peace we have to deal with all countries of the region with 
self- confidence because no one can control our will or beliefs 
or take from us what we do not want to give. He said: When I 
call for openness, I call for cooperation, coordination, and 
openness under peace to bring about progress and increase and 
improve production. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Surt, Ay Annar [January] JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY 
-- Jum'ah al-Fazzani, the secretary of the General Peoples 
Committee for Unity said that the decrees issued by the basic 
peoples congresses emphasise the importance of continuing action 
to achieve Arab unity based on the points set out in the 
declaration of the authority of the people. 
  In his response to the matter of the basic peoples 
congresses 
yesterday, to the General Peoples Congress, the secretary for 
unity said that it was highly honourable for our great Arab 
people to ask its executive administration about the process of 
achieving Arab unity. This serves to increase awareness, a 
sense of responsiblity and revolutionary spirit among the 
people, foremost among whom is the leader of the great al-fatih 
revolution, the safekeeper of Arab nationalism and Arab unity 
after his strategic goal crystallised. This awareness entailed 
realisation of the strategic goals which threaten the existence 
of the Arab nation and the resulting state of division it is in. 
This reaffirms the full responsiblity to struggle to achieve 
Arab unity. This was entrenched in the declaration of the 
authority of the people. He reiterated his emphasis on the 
unity aspiring will which is continuing for the sake of struggle 
and to achieve Arab unity from the Gulf to the Sea. 
  The secretary [word indistinct] that the matter proves the 
determination of the Libyan Arab people to follow up their 
executive bodies and to take them into account for any 
shortfallings in achieving Arab unity as a strategic option. 
The matter also shows our peoples determination, at the 
forefront who is Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great 
al fateh revolution, to pave the way for future Arab generations 
and become a model of revolutionary struggle. 
  This shortcoming in achieving Arab unity was resolved in 
[words indistinct] fraternal bureau in Khartoum by replacing the 
[words indistinct] employees there with suitable inxivixuals and 
then a suitable candidate was chosen for secretary [words 
indistinct]. The bureau then issued a publication to all 
Libyans in the Sudan on a visit or on business, particularly 
those in Khartoum and Dunqulah, to contact the bureau if they 
needed help in any matter. 
  In a short space of time, the secretariat of the General 
Peoples Committee for Unity has striven to draw up a programme 
on the level of the entire Arab world and to follow up the Arab 
union project which was presented by the leader to Arab heads of 
state and they decided on amendments to the Arab League's 
charter. 
  1) The secretary carried out several contacts with the 
secretariat of the League of Arab States and the Arab countries 
and succeeded in reviving the committee created for this purpose 
after it had ceased to exist in the face of the Arab situation 
in recent years. 
  2) A programme was devised to convene the joint higher 
committees between the Great Jamahiriyah and the fraternal Arab 
countries. These committees have so far met with Tunisia, Syria, 
the Sudan, and Egypt and preparations are underway to convene 
them with the remaining Arab countries. 
  3) The secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for 
Unity 
took upon the responsibility to draw up and implement a 
programme for co-operation with Chad, the Niger, and Mali on a 
new basis which takes into account the Islamic Arab ties with 
these countries. 
  4) The secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for 
Unity 
followed up the activities of the Arab Maghreb Union and 
participated in the various meetings, institutions, activities 
and sectors. 
  5) The secretariat followed up the implementation of the 
agreement on integration and co-operation with Egypt, and the 
Sudan and prepared projects to develop co-operation to the 
desired level for unity. 
  6) The secretariat took part in strengthening the idea of 
Arab reconciliation and reaffirmed the Great Jamahiriyah's 
willingness to exert efforts to bring an end to inter Arab 
differences and to achieve unity. 
  The secretariat followed up the implementation of the Great 
Jamahiriyah's participation in the activities of the Arab League 
and proceeded to deal with solving political developments in the 
Arab world, whether on the individual or collective level. 
  The secretariat resolved to deal with the matter of the lack 
of presence of peoples committees in the peoples bureaus and 
solved this by: 
  a) [no "b)" as received] Establishing a peoples committee 
consisting of a secretary and members each responsible for 
either integration, economic affairs, information, and cultural 
affairs, to be approved by the General Peoples Committee. 
  The secretary of the General Peoples Committee for Unity 
detailed the decrees issued by the basic peoples congresses 
which were drawn up at the general peoples congress at their 
session which dealt with the strategic plan for pan Arab action 
which is upheld by the continuous agitation by the leader to 
united the Arab world. This is the strategic framework of the 
General Peoples Committee for Unity. The basis for this are the 
ideas expounded by the leader since the eighties, where he 
highlighted the problems of Arab security, the water crisis and 
action to populate the uninhabited areas [word indistinct] Arab 
map, and also the Arab union proposal. 
  The secretary added `The secretariat of the general peoples 
congress took the following steps in order to preserve the Arab 
identity south of the Sahara and the area of the Horn of Africa. 
These included drawing up several agreements within the 
framework of economic, social and cultural integration with its 
countries, establishing joint committees to lay down executive 
programmes for these agreements, ensuring that Arab culture, the 
Arab language, are widely disseminated and to ensure that the 
Arab Islamic and African identity of this nation is preserved. 
The secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for Unity 
stepped up its efforts to complete the process of integration 
with the Sudan whereby the Sudanese president, Lt Gen 'Umar 
Hasan al-Bashir visited the Great Jamahiriyah last year and 
several Libyan and Sudanese delegations concerned with 
political, economic and investment affairs exchanged visits. [no 
closing quotation marks as received] 
  Toward this end, the secretary said that the following 
measures had been taken. 
  The joint ministerial body convened its second session last 
year in order to lay down a practical framework for 
strengthening integration between the two countries in all areas. 
  The follow up committee last [word indistinct] convened in 
order to follow up the implementation of the decisions adopted 
by the ministerial body, particularly those on trade exchanges 
and solving the negative aspects which are obstructing the way 
to their improvement. 
  The value of Libyan exports for last year was about 34 
million dinars matched with Sudanese imports at the same value. 
This created an improvement in the level of trade compared with 
the previous year, with the total value of the balance of trade 
being no more than 16 million dinars. 
  Co-operation with Egypt: The leader conducted two visits to 
the Republic of Egypt in Ay Annar [January] and Al Timour 
[October]. President Muhammad Husni Mubarak also visited the 
Great Jamahiriyah and co-operation and integration between the 
Great Jamahiriyah and Egypt was followed up in this way. 
  The follow up committee which was presided over by the 
secretary of the General Peoples Committee for Unity and the 
minister of state for cabinet affairs in Egypt convened in the 
month of al hanibal [August]. Libyan delegations from the 
various sectors convened meetings with the various specialists 
in Egypt particularly those concerned with education, 
investment, agriculture, information, trade, electricity and 
tourism. Similar Egyptian delegations visited the Great 
Jamahiriyah. Meetings took place of the working committees 
which were created to deal with the issue of unifying the 
regions of Tubruq and Marsa Matruh, programmes were drawn up 
towards this end, and their implementation will be followed up. 
  The Great Jamahiriyah and Egypt are bound by eleven 
agreements which are on the verge of being implemented. Most 
important is the agreement on the right of ownership, 
employment, residence and travel. As for the matter of 
residency in the Sudan or Egypt, the committee dealt with the 
issue based upon the leader's insistence and belief that there 
should be no difference between any Arab country and therefore 
that each and every Arab citizen should have these rights in 
every Arab country, and therefore that these four freedoms 
should be included. Towards this end, the following measures 
should be entrusted to the members of basic peoples congresses 
to open the Libyan records which were prepared and to distribute 
them by the secretariat of the General Peoples Committee for 
Unity and the secretary of the General Peoples Committee for 
Agricultural Reform, Land Reclamation and Animal Husbandry in 
order to prepare a forecast with the practical measures which 
should be pursued. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tripoli, Ay Annar [January] 27 Jamahiriyah News 
Agency -- The Jamahiriyah news agency's local affairs editor 
noted that certain foreign media outlets continue to use 
incorrect descriptions and terms when reporting on the General 
Peoples Congress, describing the latter as a parliament and 
using such terms as `minister' and `president'. 
  The editor said that the jamahiri system is a contradiction 
of the system of representation and parliamentarianism - there 
is nothing in Libya which is termed a `parliament'. Power in 
Libya is vested in the people, all the people are involved in 
decision-making, and it involves everyone of 18 years and over. 
The peoples committees are appointed through [words indistinct] 
of direct selection to act on the decisions of these people 
through peoples committees in all matters related to both 
foreign and internal policy of the Great Jamahiriyah. 
  The General Peoples Congress is the general forum of basic 
peoples congresses, peoples committees, trades unions, 
federations and vocational syndicates. It does not have the 
right to take decisions or to discuss things on behalf of others 
but instead formulates the final product of what is originally 
decided upon by the basic peoples congresses, the peoples 
committees and the secretaries of the trades unions, the 
federations and the vocational [words indistinct] syndicates. 
They are the members of the [words indistinct] attend the 
meeting of the congress carrying with them [passage indistinct]. 
  There is no such thing as a president in the jamahiri 
system. 
There is only the people. It is they who are the `president', 
the `ruler' who themselves have power vested in them, who 
determine their own destiny. The peoples congresses are the 
`president'. Furthermore, there are no `ministers' in the 
jamahiri system who represent the government but there are 
secretaries of peoples committees whom are elevated from the 
base through the basic peoples congresses throughout the Great 
Jamahiriyah with the methods of direct democracy embodied in the 
direct, free jamahiri choice. The secretaries of their peoples 
committees do not make decisions nor do they formulate foreign 
policy on behalf of the masses but instead are entrusted with 
only the implementation of foreign and internal policy which is 
drawn up by the masses. 
  This insistence by the media to use incorrect and 
contradictory terms and descriptions to report events in the 
Great Jamahiriyah. [sentence as received] It is not ignorance 
on their part, of the true nature of events taking place in 
Libya, involving the popular system and genuine democracy, 
practiced by a sovereign free people through the unique jamahiri 
system where peoples congresses make decisions and peoples 
committees act on these decisions, but is a deliberate attempt 
to cover up this great achievment by the Libyan people, who are 
heralding a new era where all forms of repression, tyranny, 
exploitation and subjugation are eliminated. It is the era of 
the masses where the people have power vested in them, and are 
self determining, without representation or go-betweens, whether 
an individual or government, whether political party or faction 
or tribe. 
  This fallacious appraisal can only be considered as part of 
a 
powerful muscle flexing war against the aspirations of a small 
nation, making a mockery of its freedom aspiring attempts. It 
is thus a war against humankind where the powerful tyrants are 
trying to deprive humankind from benefitting from an important 
experience such as Libya's. At this time, where the world is 
experiencing destructive conflicts and protests, which never 
cease due to the conventional systems' inability to solve the 
political problems they are facing, namely the problem of power, 
economic problems and the resulting social ills and disasters.

  [Excerpts] With three days to go for the municipal 
elections in Mauritania, the election campaign has been 
proceeding against a background of accusations and 
counteraccusations of fraud. This exposes the climate of 
suspicion prevailing in relations between the authorities and 
the opposition. Nonetheless, the Mauritanian Government says it 
is determined to organize the elections in an open manner. As 
an indication of its goodwill, the lists of polling station 
heads and assessors have been published. Here is Salem Meshbour 
Salem with a report from Nouakchott. 
  [Begin Salem recording] Polling station heads and their 
assessors have been appointed nationwide. The governors of the 
13 provinces that compose Mauritania have been asked by the 
government to organize introductory seminars on the 
administrative, technical, and legal procedures for the 
municipal elections. To this end, a training workshop is 
currently being held in Nouakchott for all the senior government 
officials selected to supervise the 28 January municipal 
elections. [passage omitted] 
  Despite the training and preparation of government officials 
charged with ensuring the regularity of the polls, the country's 
opposition parties do not seem to be convinced in any way. They 
have condemned the mobilization of 2,000 nonresident soldiers to 
vote for the candidate of President Ould Taya's Democratic and 
Social Republican Party in the Nouakchott Arafat district. 
Among these soldiers, the opposition has mentioned the names 
and ranks of the National Army and Gendarmerie chiefs of staff. 
However, the law stipulates that members of the Armed Forces 
can only vote in their places of residence or work. [end

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 27 Jan (AFP) -- The Sudanese Government 
forces' dry season offensive against the guerrilla has been 
going on in the south of the country "for three weeks" now 
despite warnings from the United States, the Sudanese People's 
Liberation Army [SPLA] said in Cairo today. The objective of 
the government troops is "to take control of the southern 
borders" with Uganda and Kenya in an attempt "to cut off" the 
SPLA's "supply lines," Major Daniel Kody, said during a stopover 
in Egypt. 
  "A large number of" soldiers, including regular People's 
Defense Forces--government militia--have been deployed on 
various operational fronts, Mr. Kody, a Nuba who commands the 
SPLA in Kaya, western Equatoria, further said. In the Nuba 
mountains, at about 600 km southwest of Khartoum, fighting is 
raging on three fronts. Other clashes are taking place in 
Bahr-al-Ghazal, in the southwest, around the road running 
parallel to the Aweil-Wau railroad and by which the Army conveys 
its logistics and troop reinforcements further south. Finally, 
the Armed Forces and the SPLA are also clashing between Juba and 
Kit, in line with the government forces' objective to advance 
toward Pageri and Nimule in eastern Equatoria. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Kody said contrary to last year, the government has 
decided to launch a dry season offensive this year, despite 
increasing international pressure because "the government is in 
a serious state of weakness." "The only means at its disposal 
to obtain breathing space on the internal level is by achieving 
military success in the field and to boast about it to the 
nation," Mr. Kody explained. He said the peace initiative 
launched by Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda within the 
framework of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and 
Development "stands no chance because the government is not 
serious about its willingness to negotiate." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, 28 Jan (INA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice 
chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has urged all 
Yemeni politicians abroad to return to Yemen and contribute to 
the construction process in the wake of the recently approved 
document of understanding among the Yemeni parties. 
  In statements published by the Yemeni newspapers today, 
al-Bid said among the national personalities whose return is 
sought are former South Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, 
'Abdallah al-Asnaj, Ibrahim al-Wazir, 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi, 
'Abdallah 'Abd-al-'Alim, Dr. Ahmad al-Asbahi, and others. 
  The Yemeni vice president said the real test facing Yemen at 
the present stage is the implementation of the recent agreement, 
and emphasized that his party is committed to the implementation 
of the agreement. 
  Al-Bid warned against destabilizing the southern parts of 
the 
country and threatening those working in oil companies. He said 
that this situation has forced him to redeploy some military 
units to protect the companies in Hadramawt. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid said he will not allow criminal hands to 
harm foreigners who work in the country with the companies 
exploring for Yemeni oil.

<F P=106> ['Abdallah Hammudah report: "New Initiative Arouses Fears </F>
That It May Thwart `Pledge Document'"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Patriotic Yemeni forces outside the 
ruling coalition have made a new initiative to extricate the 
country from the current political crisis. The initiative is 
based on eliminating the dispute between the General People's 
Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] -- on the 
grounds that these are the two principal forces which achieved 
unity -- and removing the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] from the 
coalition so that it will become an effective opposition force 
that can achieve a kind of balance in the political system. 
  The initiative -- which is signed by the National 
Organization for the Defense of Unity, Democracy, and Social 
Peace and the Saba' Conference for Yemeni Tribes -- says that 
the YRG's inclusion in the coalition has caused the dispute 
among the three parties to move into state institutions, hence 
causing them to play the role of a ruler and an opposition at 
the same time -- which has been associated with the crisis all 
the time. 
  A number of Yemeni intellectuals are behind the initiative. 
Asked about the bad timing of their idea -- which comes in the 
wake of the the announcement of the "Pledge and Accord 
Document," which is considered a way out of the current crisis 
-- they said that "there are still numerous dangers surrounding 
the implementation of the document. The official signing (for 
which arrangements have begun to be made recently) does not 
guarantee its implementation." [passage omitted] 
  The initiative urges the YRG to abandon its position on the 
Presidential Council ('Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani's seat) in favor 
of the GPC and its ministerial portfolios in favor of the GPC 
and the YSP. It also urges the formation of a committee 
consisting of 12 senior officials from the two parties to 
include for the first time Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar -- 
commander of the 1st Division and half brother of the Yemeni 
president -- from the GPC and Col. Qasim Yahya al-Mahla'i from 
the YSP, thus representing the military at a high level for the 
first time in the dialogue between the GPC and the YSP. Because 
the military establishments of the two sides played an important 
role in the crisis, whether with regard to the threat of an 
explosion or securing a mutual deterrent to prevent this 
explosion. 
  The initiative, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has 
obtained, stresses the need to consider 22 May -- the day unity 
between the two parts of Yemeni was announced in 1990 -- a 
starting point for resolving the crisis, building a modern state 
organ capable of implementing unionist policies, discussing the 
nature of the "coalition relationship" between the GPC and the 
YSP, and "determining the causes of tension and conflict in this 
relationship," in order to come out with a healthy and sound 
view to consolidate the elements of stability in the political 
system. 
  The initiative also urges the formation of a military 
committee comprised of the most competent commanders to assume 
the task of "reformulating the combat doctrine of the Armed 
Forces, drawing up a new defense strategy, supervising the Armed 
Forces' withdrawal from the cities and the contact areas (it 
specifies a distance of 100-150 km on both sides of the previous 
border between the two parts), drawing up a practical plan to 
rebuild the Armed Forces and set a ceiling for the troops' 
number, and reconsidering the haphazard promotions that have 
taken place over the past three years." 
  The initiative also calls for reexamining the civil service 
organ and forming a higher council to supervise administrative 
reforms, diagnose current problems, draw up a bill to regulate 
work inside it, and to achieve professional stability for 
employees "in isolation from partisan and political 
fluctuations." And also to study "the bad situation in the 
judiciary, to agree on specific measures to purge it of 
corruption, to rebuild it in order to ensure its neutrality and 
independence, and to ban any interference in its affairs by 
other state authorities." 
  The initiative also broaches the need to acknowledge the 
existence of current security conditions and "to analyze the 
phenomenon of terrorism and political assassinations" in the 
framework of an honest security study. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Presidential Council member 'Abd-al-'Aziz </F>
'Abd-al-Ghani by Salih al-Qallab in Sanaa; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Qallab] We heard that the subcommittee, 
stemming from the dialogue committee, has instructed those who 
will participate in the ceremony of the signing of the document 
of understanding to be ready to travel to Amman within days. 
Has this issue been settled? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] There are two choices -- to hold the meeting 
either in Yemen or Amman. In all cases, we consider the accord 
document a great achievement, and we insist on signing it, and 
are ready to sign it. I would like to point out here that the 
subcommittee has been meeting for some time. It is now planning 
to discuss the security issue after reaching agreement on the 
venue. When we talk about the security issue, we mean those 
measures preceding the signing process, as well as the necessary 
measures to implement this document after it is signed. These 
measures include restoring cohesion to the Presidential Council, 
the Council of Ministers, and all the other state institutions. 
  [Al-Qallab] We have learned that the committee has set 6 
February as a date for signing the document? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes, around this date. If the meeting is to 
be held in Amman, then the date will be agreed upon in the light 
of His Majesty King Husayn's schedule and his return from his 
trip abroad, and also in the light of the time the Jordanian 
authorities need to arrange for such a meeting. 
  [Al-Qallab] This means that the president and vice president 
have accepted in principle the invitation that was extended to 
them by His Majesty King Husayn's adviser? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes, we have accepted the invitation with 
gratitude and appreciation. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Qallab] Egypt has more than once complained that Yemen 
has turned into a base for the elements and sides which work 
against it. Is there any coordination between you and Egypt on 
these issues? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] We denounce all actions aimed against the 
security of the brothers in Egypt and elsewhere. We contacted 
the Egyptian brothers and told them that we are fully ready to 
cooperate with them to check any action meant to harm fraternal 
Egypt. We are against terrorism and we denounce it in part and 
parcel anywhere in the world. 
  [Al-Qallab] Have you arrested any non-Yemeni elements? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] We have arrested a number of Arabs who 
fought 
in Afghanistan. We have the full list of the names of members 
of this organization inside and outside Yemen. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] His Majesty King Husayn has concluded his visit 
to the United States and left for Austria following several 
meetings in Washington, the last of which was with the U.S. 
secretary of state. [passage omitted] 
  The way Jordan thinks about the nature of the conflict, how 
it should be resolved, and the future of the region in light of 
comprehensive peace has been appreciated by the U.S. 
Administration and public opinion. U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher reiterated U.S. appreciation for His Majesty 
King Husayn's leading role in supporting the peace process to 
allow it to achieve its objectives. 
  [Begin recording, in English] [Christopher] I am very 
pleased to welcome here to the State Department His Majesty King 
Husayn. He's a rather frequent visitor of the United States, 
but each time he's very welcome and this time his visit happens 
to coincide with the renewal of the bilateral discussions 
between Jordan and Israel here in Washington with a streamlined, 
though informal, setting. So I think prospects are very good 
for making progress there. I am very pleased by a number of 
developments in the relations between the U.S. and Jordan since 
the last time I met with the king. So in many respects, this is 
a very happy occasion, and, as I always do when I see him, I 
look forward to it by welcoming you here, your majesty. It is a 
great pleasure to have you here. 
  [Husayn] Thank you very, very much indeed, sir, for the warm 
and kind welcome. It is a pleasure to be back in Washington. 
I've had the privilege of meeting with the President and 
meeting with many of my friends, and now this is really a 
wonderful opportunity to be with you, sir. We've seen you in 
the area. We appreciate all the efforts that you've made in the 
cause of our arrival at a just and comprehensive peace in our 
region. And you have our gratitude, admiration, and respect. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] expect to conclude a peace 
treaty with Israel? I represent Israel television. 
  [Husayn] Sir, I hope that we will have started in earnest 
now to discuss all items in the agenda and to cover all these 
subjects. And I believe our approach is the right one to try to 
resolve all the problems that are there and the crowning 
achievement will be a peace treaty [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty: Can you elaborate on what you mean 
by full peace with Israel? 
  [Husayn] Full peace is full peace. It is a peace that 
brings people together, that gives them the opportunities they 
never had, that changes the face of our region as a whole, that 
is our contribution to future regions. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] Israeli to sign, to move 
ahead at all, and not waiting for anybody else. Is Jordan ready 
to move ahead without waiting for anybody else? 
  [Husayn] We are not waiting for anybody, but we hope that, 
as things will move, we will all meet before too long, having 
accomplished our work in establishing the just and lasting peace 
that we have sought for so long. 
  [Reporter] What can you tell us about the talks that are 
taking place in Washington now? Are they making enough progress 
for them to ask the full delegations to come next week? 
  [Christopher] You know, I've just returned from abroad, and 
the talks have just started, so I think it's too early to say, 
but the new format in which the heads of delegations meet under 
streamlined conditions, I think, is very promising, and we'll 
see in a week or so whether or not the full delegations should 
come here. One thing I would emphasize, and that is, I feel that 
real progress can be made in the format that they now have. So 
I wouldn't make judging progress dependent on whether and when 
the full delegations will come here. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Secretary: Jordan seems to be very close to 
an agreement with Israel and I feel that they could have had it, 
if not last year, probably 10 years ago. Do you think that 
Jordan should move ahead and set an example to the Syrian, or 
does the use of the codeword comprehensive mean that you agree 
that Jordan ought to wait for the others and [word indistinct] 
both sign together? 
  [Christopher] You know, the role the United States has in 
these conversations and negotiations is the role of a cosponsor. 
I think the timing is really up to the parties, and I wouldn't 
want to try to impose United States views, with respect to 
timing. What we want to see is steady progress on all fronts, 
and I think the king has given you his indication that they are 
making steady progress on all fronts. So I would not, I think 
it will be too arrogant for the United States to try to suggest 
to the parties a precise timing under which they'll move ahead. 
Steady progress is what we now see. Thank you very much. 
  [Husayn] Thank you sir. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [News conference by King Husayn with Arab and international </F>
media representatives in Washington "at the conclusion of his 
visit to the United States" -- recorded; in English except where 
noted] 
  [Text] [Husayn] I welcome the brother representatives of 
the media to this meeting here in Washington. [preceding 
sentence in Arabic] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen. I'd like to say how pleased I am to 
have this opportunity to be with you here on this last day of 
our visit to Washington this time. It has been a very, very 
good visit all together, a private visit in a sense. I've had 
the chance to have the preplanned medical checkup and I'm told 
that I have a clean bill of health which will require me only to 
have another one later in the summer and then to revert to a 
normal annual check up. 
  Obviously, I came to Washington on this visit and at this 
very, very important time. I had the very great pleasure and 
privilege of meeting the president who was kind enough to see me 
despite his very heavy and demanding commitments and schedule. 
My admiration for him has grown ever since I have known him. 
We have been in constant touch. More than ever before, I feel 
that we are all fortunate in our region to have President 
Clinton, a man with a big heart, with the great knowledge that 
he has accumulated of every aspect of the problems we are trying 
to resolve and a clear determination to help see us through, and 
see with us hopefully the breaking of the dawn of peace in our 
entire region, a man of integrity and determination. 
  I've had several occasions to visit with friends. I've 
spoken on several occasions during this visit and I realize 
right now that we are beginning once again to negotiate on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track as well as on the other ones. There had 
been developments in the recent past including the important 
meeting between the president and my brother President Hafiz 
al-Asad. I believe it was a successful meeting and I hope that 
we will see progress on all tracks leading to our objective of 
achieving a comprehensive peace. As far as we are concerned in 
Jordan, we are now moving to address all the subjects that are 
listed in the agenda, the Jordanian-Israeli agenda, and I hope 
that we will see success in dealing with all of these problems 
in a satisfactory way. I hope we can achieve symmetry in terms 
of the interests of both sides. I hope that, if it is possible, 
we will see the implementation of some of the agreements as we 
go along which will help sensitize people to what peace really 
means and what the promise of peace really is. 
  Some may have questioned this approach. As far as we are 
concerned, we are confident that we are right in the sense that 
we are moving to address all the problems and to find solutions 
for them so that the crowning achievement of this whole process 
is the ratification of a peace treaty. Hopefully it will come 
within the context of peace between all the parties concerned in 
the region. But in any event, we have resisted the suggestion, 
that came up once in a while in the recent past, that we ratify 
a piece of paper and then begin to negotiate what it means. We 
believe that the right approach is to negotiate all the 
subjects. We are open-minded and determined and hopefully the 
result will be the kind of peace that people can live with and 
protect and enjoy. 
  Things are moving quite rapidly and I hope that before too 
long we will see some tangible results which will be the legacy 
that we can leave for future generations in our region and in 
the world. 
  So, I'd be more than happy now to answer any of your 
questions or to hear any of your comments. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, [words indistict] 
(?implementation) of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of 
Principles, assuming they can reach final closure and begin to 
implement the agreement, will that have an impact on the pace at 
which Jordan signs a peace treaty or negotiates a peace treaty 
with Israel? 
  [Husayn] Well I certainly hope, sir, that they will make 
progress and that they will implement what they agreed upon and 
they will find solutions to clarify what they haven't agreed 
upon as yet. As far as we are concerned, we are going to help as 
much as we can, and our support for our Palestinian brethren in 
terms of Jordan will continue. And as far as the work ahead, 
there are obviously many areas where there will be bilateral, 
multilateral, trilateral negotiations. We have made it very, 
very clear to our Palestinian brethren that we are ready to help 
when we know what is needed and when we are approached and when 
we reach agreement with them over any subject of interest. But 
in terms of the background, I believe that we started together 
in Madrid, we went to Madrid, in Jordan's case, following a 
national meeting that was attended by all elected bodies in the 
country and representatives of our people and we decided that we 
have to move with conviction towards the establishment of peace. 
  We provided the umbrella for the joint delegation, we 
enabled 
our Palestinian brethren to speak for themselves and we went to 
Moscow and we have attended every meeting dealing with peace. 
And then we finally came to Washington and of course we started 
to work together until a very monumental event, a very historic 
event took place on the 13th of September, when the Israelis and 
the Palestinians recognized each other and met here in the city 
of Washington, outside the White House. We saw that handshake 
that will be remembered in the times ahead. 
  So the umbrella has been shut down and relegated to the 
closets of history but nonetheless, we immediately hailed what 
happened as a courageous step on both sides in terms of a vision 
of the future and a sense of responsibility towards generations 
to come. And we immediately, on the 14th of September, ratified 
the agenda that we had held up to that time to see some progress 
on the Palestinian track. 
  Now we are dealing with the agenda and all the items there 
and I hope we will see some rapid progress. In the meantime, 
all the other parties are involved and engaged and it certainly 
is my hope that what will come out is a comprehensive peace at 
the end. But now we are dealing with our own problem. And I 
think that they are complex and they will be demanding of time 
and effort and yet we are going at our own speed now. 
  [Reporter] Some of the Palestinian leadership would believe 
that one of the problems, which is security of Jericho and 
whether Palestinians alone will be able to police the border 
between Jericho and Jordan, there is some in the Palestinian 
leadership who suggest that Jordan has objected to the idea that 
Palestinians would be able to control the border by themselves 
and that Jordan made those objections known to the United State 
and to Israel. 
  [Husayn] I would like to categorically deny that, and 
suggest 
that it was very unfortunate that such a suggestion should even 
be made. Jordan is a state, sir, Jordan has its borders, Jordan 
has its positions on the bridges and Jordan continues to have 
the right to exercise looking after its borders and its 
territories. We were informed that the Oslo agreement 
stipulated that external security was Israel's domain for the 
initial phases. We did not comment in any form or way. We 
heard what you all heard and obviously if the Palestinians are 
able to look after the bridges on their side, that is most 
welcome by us. But that is something that Israel and the 
Palestinians have to decide upon. It is nothing that reflects 
on us or concerns us in any way except in the hope that whatever 
happens will help our brethren in the occupied territories and 
will make them feel that there is real progress towards a 
change, a change in the quality of life, a change in conditions 
that have persisted for 26 terrible years. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] Your Majesty, could you assess 
your relationship with the PLO leaders right now, particularly 
Chairman 'Arafat, and comment on whether you think it will be 
natural and inevitable for Jordan's large Palestinian population 
to look for leadership both to your majesty and to the PLO? 
  [Husayn] As far as we are concerned, sir, and facing all the 
realities of today as we have done in the past, we in Jordan, 
all Jordanians, regardless of their origins are members of one 
family that have and will continue to share equal rights until 
such time that any would wish otherwise or have the opportunity 
to exercise another option. Jordan is unique in the Arab world 
in that sense, which has been our approach throughout. We will 
continue to help our brethren to the best our ability in the 
occupied territories, we will continue to hope, as we have made 
it very, very clear that the leadership of the Palestinians will 
rise to the level of the challenges it faces right now. We hope 
and pray that the steps that will be taken will lead eventually 
to the fulfillment of Palestinian aspirations regarding 
Palestinian rights on Palestinian soil, in terms of democracy, 
pluralism, respect for human rights. We hope that all will have 
part in shaping the future, both inside and outside, and 
particularly those who have lived through the 26 years of 
occupation and endured them and hung to their land, and endured 
all the difficulties that are known to all. 
  I hope that the Palestinian institutions will come into 
being, I hope that there will be the potential for the very 
talented Palestinians within the region and throughout the world 
to put their resources and energies into the coming phase. So 
as far as we are concerned, we will continue to help in any way 
we can. If you are referring to our relations in terms of the 
future, I hope that they will be very clear. We will implement 
whatever we agree upon, we will always call for cooperation, 
coordination to the best of our abilities, but also we are going 
to be very, very clear. If we don't have the kind of 
coordination that is needed, we will make it public. We cannot 
assume responsibilities for something that we are not involved 
in. 
  Regarding the future relationship, I believe that this is 
something for people to decide, in time. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, it is obvious from what you just 
said, and in past pronouncements publicly and privately, that 
you felt on a number of occasions that [words indistinct] great 
frustration because of the lack of coordination between you and 
the PLO leadership, and particularly with Chairman 'Arafat. 
This is another question about the illusive coordination among 
the Arabs. You said that you advised Mr. 'Arafat, publicly and 
privately, to drop the word confederation or confederacy from 
his political lexicon. I would like you to expand a little bit 
on that, and would I be stretching it too much to say that, 
judging from what you just said, you do not believe that the PLO 
leadership has risen to the occasion, in other words? And if I 
add one thing, is it true also that you've reached an agreement 
with President al-Asad of Syria that Jordan and Syria and 
Lebanon also will sign peace treaties together? 
  [Husayn] Jordan is moving, Syria is moving, Lebanon is 
moving. I hope that our objective of a comprehensive peace will 
be achieved. The Palestinians are moving. I am not talking 
about the past. I am talking about a critical moment, I am 
talking about the future. And it is certainly my hope that all 
of us will rise to the level of their responsibilities, in terms 
of what is happening and the impact of all that is happening on 
the future of the region as a whole. 
  We hope relations are fine, sir, but as far as 
confederation, 
maybe the talk about it as a concept was warranted at a certain 
point in time to help Palestinians reach the point they have 
reached and enable them to speak for themselves, as they are 
doing and as they've done both in Oslo and leading on to 
Washington and on to whatever is happening right now. But as 
far as the future is concerned, sir, we have lived in the Arab 
world and we have tried our very best, and between the emotional 
feelings about Arab unity and between the setbacks that we have 
had, our position is the following: Jordan and Palestine are 
very, very close together. We're members of one family. But 
federations and confederations and whatever cannot be determined 
by individuals, and depending on their feelings at any point in 
time. They are the sum total of the conviction of people that 
this is the right approach. So we're happy to have been able to 
help our Palestinian brethren to get where they are and, 
hopefully, to achieve their objectives. But, as close as we are 
to them, we'll support them to the best of our abilities, and 
the future will have to take care of itself when, under 
conditions of freedom and democratic institutions are there, 
when people decide and they can have something that is 
meaningful, that will last. And I believe that will come 
inevitably, sooner of later. So for the time being, I've asked 
President 'Arafat to drop this word from his vocabulary, 
certainly in talking with me. Let's get on with it, let us work 
from the grassroots upwards. Let us dispel the false 
impressions that we had any objective other than helping our 
Palestinian brethren recover their rights on their soil, helping 
them through the very difficult times that they have endured so 
far. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, what are you going to do for the 
refugees' problem in the Arab world? Do you envisage peace and 
signature of a peace agreement without a solution to this 
problem? If your majesty will give me an answer in Arabic, 
please? 
  [Husayn, in Arabic] This is one of the important issues that 
must be addressed by everybody. As far as we are concerned in 
Jordan, as I have said a short while ago, we are highly 
sensitive to this issue regarding the needs of people. Peace 
should entail a radical change toward the better in terms of the 
people's life and the aspired-for peace. Naturally, there are 
resolutions on either return or compensation, or any other 
method, but this dimension must be addressed shortly so peace 
can have a meaning and there will be a lasting peace that gives 
everybody a good opportunity to live under this peace. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, we have seen another (?goal) 
handshake recently between King Fahd and and Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, 
though from what we have seen in photographs, mercifully it was 
without the traditional Arab kisses. When are we going to see 
your majesty shaking hands also with King Fahd, considering the 
fact that Jordan has a very important role to play in the peace 
process? 
  [Husayn] If you take it that way, I have been a follower of 
my grandfather and his late Majesty King 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
Bin-Sa'ud, who came together and settled their differences and 
left us the responsibility to work together as members of one 
family in the interest of our nation. Our relations have passed 
through a period, I think, that there are so many aspects that 
have to be addressed and could be addressed when we are able to 
meet face to face, as I have tried since the outset. As far as 
we are concerned, we are most anxious to see the relations 
return to their warmth and to be based on mutual confidence and 
trust and to be based on the desire to cooperate in the interest 
of the Arab nation as a whole. I hope the time will come, and I 
think we are moving in the right direction. And I believe when 
we have a chance to meet, we'll discover that it was a very 
serious storm in a teacup, and I hope that our brethren in Saudi 
Arabia will realize that we never meant them any harm, nor did 
we cause them any harm at all. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, [words indistinct] interview this 
weekend that you believe that [words indistinct] peace. Does 
this mean that a peace treaty [words indistinct] signed between 
Syria and Israel and Lebanon and Israel... 
  [Husayn, interrupting] I certainly hope that this will 
happen. I think there is indication of movement in that 
direction. I think very important steps are taking place. I 
think there are two camps. There is a peace camp that we can see 
and I think that it represents the hopes of the majority of 
people in the entire region. There are the skeptics who may be 
still living in the past or living in today in terms of not 
seeing that if this chance and opportunity is missed, the result 
is total disaster in the entire region. 
  I came to assume my constitutional responsibilities, based 
on the Hegira calender. In another few days, on the 17th of 
Sha'ban, I will be 60. What interests do I have? I have only 
the same interests that I have had in all the years that have 
passed, to do something for, to leave something for people to 
enjoy the kind of life that has been denied them, to know that 
they can wake up tomorrow, and know what hopefully it will 
bring, not to live in uncertainty, in tension, to have the 
opportunity to divert energies and resources towards what is 
worthwhile, building their future in the entire region. If we 
can achieve it, we will certainly do our very best. The 
timeframe, I think the way things are moving, in fact, so many 
surprises, most of them are pleasant in the recent past, 
hopefully, it may be the end of this year. It may be next year, 
but we are moving, determinedly, and I hope that it will be a 
comprehensive peace. As far as Jordan and Israel are concerned, 
we are dealing with our own problems right now. We still have a 
long way to go. We think that the other tracks will move, and I 
hope, eventually, we will be together. 
  [Reporter] I have a question for you on Iraq. Did you 
discuss the situation in Iraq with the Clinton Administration? 
And have you seen any change in the Clinton Administration's 
position towards Iraq and the embargo? 
  [Husayn] I haven't discussed it in any substantive way. I 
have always said that I hope that this nightmare will come to an 
end, sometime very soon, and particularly as it impacts on the 
Iraqi people, and their continued suffering under the prevailing 
conditions. Somehow, I hope we will get out of the area of Iraq 
not being an active, constructive part of the Arab world and the 
community of nations, as soon as possible. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, you met with a group of Jewish 
leaders this week. And it was very successful meeting. I heard 
you talk about a warm peace. Could you tell us what a warm 
peace would look like between Jordan and Israel, and what a warm 
peace in your view would look like in the region? 
  [Husayn] I didn't use the expression warm peace. I think, 
maybe, the description of the meeting was that what I implied. 
A warm peace may not be a very pleasant one. [laughter by 
reporters] But, I talked of peace, a real peace, the peace that 
gives everybody the opportunity to work together, and to achieve 
their hopes for the future. And I spoke in detail about some of 
the problems that we are to address: A) the problem of occupied 
territories. And I am talking about Jordanian occupied 
territories, without prejudice to what our Palestinian brothers 
are talking about right now. And I have stated categorically 
that in that regard, we feel very, very strongly that these 
areas, the small problem in the north of the Jordan Valley, but 
there is a considerable area in the southern Jordan Valley that 
needs to be looked at in the sense of the urgency of our demand 
that Jordanian territory be returned to us. So, there is the 
suggestion, and hopefully movement on creating a group that will 
look at delineation and demarcation of these borders. 
  And my hope is that the coming days will see some progress 
here. Then, people can move on the ground there. Once that is 
settled, and it has to mean the return of Jordanian territory to 
Jordanian sovereignty, then we can look at the entire rift 
valley and look at what can be done in the context of looking at 
it as a complete economic unit in terms of resources, in terms 
of all the potential that there is to develop to the best way 
possible to the benefit of all. So, the question of borders, 
and territories, and sovereignty over our territories is one of 
the aspects that has to be addressed. Another area is water. 
And there again, I believe that all the available resources 
might not be adequate for the needs of all concerned in the 
future. But certainly, we have got to work out the distribution 
of these waters in a satisfactory way, in terms of the 
percentages that are peoples' right. Beyond that, hopefully, in 
a context of peace, we can look at what can be done beyond that 
to secure needed water for all concerned. And obviously the 
third dimension--and this is not all, because I have many other 
items on the agenda--is the human dimension. There has to be a 
qualitative change of life. I would hope that the priority will 
be given to people in the occupied territories, but, beyond 
that, the region, for everybody to feel what peace is, to know 
what peace is, to realize what transformation there is as we 
progress along to its (?end). 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, for many years, you have fears in 
Jordan that the Israelis would do something that would lead to 
another massive influx of Palestinian refugees from the 
territories. Are you worried about that happening under 
Palestinian control in the territories for one reason or 
another, either civil war or economic breakdown? And have you 
done anything to....? 
  [Husayn, interrupting, laughing] [words indistinct] have you 
woken up on the wrong side of bed this morning [laughing] [words 
indistinct] excuse my being so personal. But, let's look at the 
positive side, let's not talk about disasters, and things that I 
hope will not.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Your Majesty, Jordan has survived 
for many years because you anticipated [words indistinct] 
disasters. [words indistinct]. 
  [Husayn, interrupting] I don't anticipate hopefully any 
more. 
I am really optimistic; and that is my tendency. Of course, one 
can never be absolutely certain that things would work the way 
we wish. But, I think that there is a general consensus amongst 
the overwhelming majority of people that we move towards 
resolving problems. I hope Palestinians on their soil will 
enjoy democracy, pluralism, respect for human rights, and the 
chance to live and work with us. And I hope that Jordan and 
Palestine eventually can be an example to others in the entire 
region. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, your expressed your hope for a 
comprehensive peace among all parties [words indistict] work 
together. But can you foresee circumstances under which Jordan 
would sign a peace treaty with Israel moving ahead of Syria and 
Lebanon? 
  [Husayn] I would certainly hope that it will be a 
comprehensive peace. I believe that we are working towards that 
end. We are coordinating with our Syrian brethren; we are 
coordinating with our Lebanese brethren; we are coordinating 
with our Palestinian brethren; we are coordinating with Egypt to 
the best of our abilities. There are many subjects that are 
being discussed. But, we slowed down until our Palestinian 
brethren made their move. It was very, very important to see 
the Palestinian dimension, the root cause of the bigger problem 
in the region and the world, was addressed. They've assumed the 
responsibilities as they wished since 1974, and we've recognized 
that was the way things should move and then that made their 
move. Now, we are trying to help them; we are trying to resolve 
our own problems. I believe that there are enough subjects that 
must be covered before we arrive at ratifying a peace treaty. 
My own impression is that the time element will bring 
everything together almost at the same time. So, that's how we 
are moving. We are not trying to have a race, we're trying to 
address problems so that we resolve them once and for all, so 
that people can enjoy peace in the region. We're not ... 
[pauses] We're masters of our own destiny; we're working in 
regard to our own sphere. We're trying to see at the same time 
that we encourage movement on all other tracks. And I believe 
that problems elsewhere are probably less than they are as they 
affect us, because Jordan has borne the brunt of every disaster 
that has occurred over the years and the heaviest of weights. 
So, we have a long way to go, but I hope, with good will on 
either side -- Israeli and Jordanian -- we'll see rapid progress 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [word indistinct] Your Majesty, you've spoken 
optimistically about peace. Could you give us a more specific 
timetable of when Jordan and Israel could reach a peace 
agreement. Are we talking about months, are we talking about by 
the end of 1994? 
  [Husayn] I can't, sir. How can I give you a timetable. It 
does not depend on me, it depends also on the Israeli side. And 
I hope that, at least, as far as we are concerned right now, the 
Israeli partners in the negotiations will realize that instead 
of spending too much time on looking at how we can sign a piece 
of paper, and call it a peace treaty, and then negotiate it, let 
us get to negotiations. I believe that this is happening, and 
therefore, I hope that it won't take long before we discuss all 
the problems that need to be resolved, and then the peace treaty 
will come. We are committed to signing it and ratifying it when 
it is and when it will be the crowning achievement of resolving 
all the problems between us. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, in your opinion sir, did the 
statements made by President al-Asad at the summit represent a 
change or advance in Syria's position, or were they a 
restatement of Syria's traditional formula? 
  [Husayn] I don't believe they are merely a restatement of 
previous positions. I believe that they were statements that 
were welcomed by all. And I believe that there is a general 
consensus amongst all who know President al-Asad that he is a 
man of his word. I believe he went further than he went at 
anytime, and he is talking about comprehensive peace, in the 
term of obviously addressing of Syrian demands regarding Syria's 
territory and rights. So, I think that we are much more ahead 
of what we were, and we are very serious about it, too. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, if I can ask you another question 
about Jerusalem, I know that Jordan would like to attain 
Hashemite control over Jerusalem. Has Jerusalem and the future 
of Jerusalem entered into any of the talks you've been involved 
with Palestinians or with the Israelis? Could you enlighten me 
on what Jordan would like to see as far as Jerusalem is 
concerned? 
  [Husayn] Sir, if we are talking about Security Council 
Resolution 242 being the foundation of the ongoing process right 
now, then obviously, as far as the Palestinian-Israeli dimension 
of the problem, Jerusalem, in some form of way, must become the 
essence of peace and the symbol of the meeting between the two 
people in the future. [Resolution] 242 takes care of that, and 
the negotiations, I am sure, will deal with this problem and 
address it adequately. As far as the holy places are concerned, 
of the three great monotheistic religions, the three Abrahamic 
religions, we are assuming our responsibilities and we are proud 
to continue to do whatever we can regarding what has been left 
to us to look after since 1974 by the Arab summit. But, there 
is an idea that we've been trying to put across, and that is the 
need to consider, maybe for the first time in our history within 
the region, the possibility through something that is happening, 
and we have encouraged and been involved in for some period of 
time, interfaith dialogue, between the three great religions. 
But beyond that, possibly the sovereignty over all these holy 
places and the fact that in our view, we believe that we will 
not recognize any sovereignty over them except to God. I hope 
that, somehow in the context of peace, this problem can be 
addressed and maybe the followers of the three great religions 
can come to realize what the significance of Jerusalem is to all 
of them and move it outside the political equation, move the 
holy places outside that particular dimension. We refer to the 
Hashemites and their responsibilities who continue to shoulder 
them, we hope, and we are suggesting that a non- political 
Islamic representation can be found that would assume our 
responsibilities, or that we would support, representing all the 
different schools in the Islamic world, responsible, so that the 
Islamic holy places revert to Islamic sovereignty, in other 
words, or represent that. And hopefully a dialogue, eventually 
set between the three great religions will produce some 
situation in Jerusalem that will make us all meet there in 
worship of the one God. And I think that the area has had such 
an impact on the world in the past in terms of the spiritual 
dimension. I don't know if it might be too ambitious to think 
of, or consider, the possibility of realizing, all of us, that 
it wasn't God's will that that small area within that sacred 
city, important to all of us, by His will, should be the subject 
of wars and conflicts, but the means for all believers to come 
together and to enjoy those holy places. 
  [Reporter] When you talk about a small area, what area are 
you talking about, is that the old city or what? 
  [Husayn] I am talking about Jerusalem in terms of 242. That 
is something the Israelis and the Palestinians should resolve. 
I hope the holy places will find something that will make them 
important to all of us, and that sovereignty over them will be 
recognized by all and all, to be that of the Almighty God. 
  [Reporter] Talking about Jerusalem, Your Majesty, you said 
before that the only sovereignty over Jerusalem is to God. 
[reporter switches to Arabic] But the Palestinians say that 
Jerusalem should return to the Palestinian sovereignty. What is 
your majesty's opinion? 
  [Husayn, in Arabic] Concerning Jerusalem, we have spoken 
about 242 and the city, and we said that Jerusalem must be the 
symbol of peace between the Palestinians and Israelis as long as 
we are talking about the Palestinian entity which will be 
established, or on its way to be established. Regarding the 
holy places, we believe in the need to continue dialogue among 
religions. However, we do not consider any sovereignty over 
these places except that of Almighty God. We appeal to the 
Islamic world and we work to have a group representing all 
different schools which we will support as much as we can in 
order to achieve what we aspire for in terms of giving Jerusalem 
its spiritual dimension. This city is in our hearts and 
consciences, and so we must save it from this whirlpool 
concerning claiming it by this or that party, whether in the 
Arab world or elsewhere. Consequently, our Islamic holy places 
will return to us and will be safeguarded for the entire Islamic 
world. We believe that this is the most appropriate and the 
best. We hope that all sides will, through dialogue, reach a 
situation which puts Jerusalem in the position which Almighty 
God wanted for all of us; namely, the followers of the three 
Abrahamic religions. 
  Thank you very very much indeed. [preceding sentence in 
English]

<F P=106> [Report by Nabil Ghishan] </F>
  [Excerpts] The government's food and medicine policy was 
the main topic of the hot debate that took place at the House of 
Representatives during yesterday's session. Following a lengthy 
discussion, the House decided to devote its session on Wednesday 
to the government's food and medicine policy. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question by Deputy Bassam al-'Umush, Tourism and 
Antiquities Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Affash al-'Adwan denied what 
was reported by some newspapers that there are tourist 
activities between Jordan and Israel in the Petra area and that 
companies are arranging such matters. The minister said: These 
allegations are baseless. He said that there are no contacts at 
all with the Israelis in this regard and no companies are 
arranging for this. 
  Deputy Bassam al-'Umush announced that he was not convinced 
with the minister's response, particularly in light of the visit 
of 83 rabbis, who desecrated the land of mobilization and 
steadfastness and the soil of Jordan when they walked on the 
streets of al-'Aqabah, Amman, and Petra. Al-'Umush added: They 
were about to meet with a senior official, but they were kind 
enough to excuse him because he was very busy. Deputy al-'Umush 
said that some Jewish rabbis took part in the recent 
Islamic-Christian dialogue held in Amman. [passage omitted] 
  Deputy al-'Umush said: We still hear every now and then 
about the calls on the private sector to make investments, 
particularly in Petra, because tourists are coming now secretly 
with U.S. passports. He added: Tourists will come openly in the 
future, particularly since the Jews are using the name Petra to 
propagate tourism in the region through world media which are 
under their control. We cannot accept the excuse that we 
receive foreigners because they carry foreign passports. A Jew, 
he said, remains a Jew regardless of his citizenship. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Amman JORDAN TIMES in English carried in its 27-28 January 
issue a 100-word front-page REUTER report which says that 
"Jordanian deputies condemned 83 Jewish rabbis for visiting the 
Kingdom." A statement, signed by 29 members of the House of 
Representatives, says: "We, like our people, were shocked by 
the rabbis' visit because it is something that was previously 
not allowed and they want to make it become something normal."]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Are Proud of the Early Call for Peace"] </F>
  [Text] At the invitation of the U.S. Council on Foreign 
Relations, and before prominent personalities interested in 
international affairs, His Majesty King Husayn has expressed 
pride in having had the privilege to preach peace in the Middle 
East, a region that has been a beacon, and that has contributed 
much to the progress of mankind throughout its history on many 
levels. 
  Jordan, since 1967, has been trying by all means to achieve 
progress toward a peace that will satisfy future generations. 
This has been going on since the issuance of UN Security 
Council Resolution 242, passing through all the international 
initiatives that followed and ending with the Madrid conference 
from which the current peace process emanated. In this state of 
mind, we viewed the historic handshake and reconciliation which 
took place on 13 September 1993 as an act of great wisdom and 
great courage on both sides. In the same state of mind, Jordan 
has supported the progress that was made on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track, and ratified the agenda with Israel 
the next day [14 September]. 
  Today, as at any time in the past, Jordan believes in the 
need to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle 
East, and hopes for similar progress on all the other 
Arab-Israeli tracks in order to achieve the ultimate goal; 
namely, the signing of a peace treaty with Israel, which should 
reflect on the lives of people on both sides. Before signing 
such a treaty, Jordanian territory must first return to 
Jordanian sovereignty, Jordan must restore its share of water, 
and great attention must be given to the people in the occupied 
territories in a way that will enable them to see an immediate 
change in the quality of their lives. Above all, a solution 
must be found to the refugee problem, which has affected Jordan 
more than any other neighboring Arab state. 
  While reviewing Jordan's position on various regional and 
international issues, King Husayn expressed great pride in his 
one family, and in democracy and all that it has entrenched in 
terms of freedom, power-sharing, pluralism, and respect for 
human rights. His majesty also expressed great optimism over the 
future of this region which is still heading toward a new Middle 
East abounding with peace prospects, development, prosperity, 
and hopes of harmony, cooperation, openness, and mutual respect 
among the followers of the three monotheistic religions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "AL-Hariri: 'Arafat Has To Submit </F>
Application To Visit Lebanon; Lebanon, Syria Are Agreed on 
Signing Together With Jordan"] 
  [Excerpts] London, AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI -- At a news 
conference which he held at the foreign correspondents 
association in London the night before last, Lebanese Prime 
Minister Rafiq al-Hariri said that Lebanon would not sign a 
separate agreement with Israel before Syria. 
  Al-Hariri, who began an official visit to Britain on Monday, 
during which he met with Prime Minister John Major and Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd, said that Syria and Lebanon are agreed 
on signing together with Jordan a peace agreement with Israel. 
  Al-Hariri said it is early to talk about a meeting with 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin before reaching an 
agreement on a full Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory 
and before a halt to the shelling of civilians in southern 
areas. The Lebanese prime minister described the matter as not 
personal. 
  Asked about the possibility of Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat visiting Lebanon, al-Hariri said that "'Arafat has to 
submit an application for the visit, and we will consider it." 
Asked whether the visits Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command, 
makes to his forces' positions in southern Beirut are conducted 
with permission from the Lebanese state, al-Hariri said that "he 
has not looked at Ahmad Jibril's passport." 
  Al-Hariri renewed his rejection of [Palestinian] settlement. 
He was answering a question about whether he was being subjected 
to international pressures to settle the Palestinians, 
especially as Lebanese officials always talk about his 
rejection. Al-Hariri said that "it is Lebanon which is raising 
this question, because the Constitution does not allow that, nor 
does the present government. Our position on settlement is 
attributable to its adverse effect on the demographic situation 
in Lebanon, and hence on the political situation." 
  Al-Hariri pointed out that the Gaza-Jericho agreement did 
not 
talk about the future of 300,000 Palestinian refugees living in 
Lebanon. 
  On the al-Ta'if accord, al-Hariri said that "any 
constitution 
or agreement can be developed. I emphasized that in my speech 
at the Chamber of Deputies. I stressed that this change and 
development must be based on common coexistence, balance, and 
political participation." 
  On the extent of Lebanon's willingness to request the Syrian 
forces' withdrawal from its territory if Israel agrees to 
withdraw, al-Hariri said: "We will study this question at the 
right time and in the light of new developments. The Syrian 
Army is playing a positive role in safeguarding security and 
restoring stability in most parts of Lebanese territory." 
[passage omitted] 
  On the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the Lebanese prime minister 
said that the fate of this agreement is to be decided by the 
Palestinians and their institutions. 
  The Lebanese official is expected to leave London for Beirut 
tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Tariq Tarshishi report: "Al-Hariri in Frank Dialogue With </F>
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Editorial Board: Naturalization File Has Not 
Been Closed; Administrative Purge Is an Ongoing Process"] 
  [Text] London -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri 
has emphasized that Lebanon is not considering building an army 
that wages war but is considering strengthening the Army and the 
Internal Security Forces to enable them to "maintain general 
order" in the country. 
  Al-Hariri was on a visit to the Arab Press House and was 
joined there by Lebanese journalists working for AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT, AL-MAJALLAH, and SAYYIDATI. 
  As the guest of the [Arab Press] House, he met there with 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Chief Editor 'Uthman al-'Umayr, AL-MAJALLAH 
Chief Editor 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Rashid, SAYYIDATI Chief Editor 
Matar al-Ahmadi, and the company's General Manager Yasir 
al-Dabbagh. They then moved to the conference table where Prime 
Minister al-Hariri discussed details of Lebanon's internal and 
external situations. 
  Al-Hariri said: Lebanon is a friend of all the Arab states 
including those who supported it and those who did not, but 
there can be no doubt that the position of some states is 
distinguishable from other Arab states in that they fulfilled 
their commitments and were clearer in what they said. The 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under the leadership of Custodian of the 
Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz spares no effort in 
supporting Lebanon and its causes and has fully honored its 
commitments, and so have Kuwait and Syria, which sent assistance 
at the time of the Israeli attempt to hit southern Lebanon. 
  Al-Hariri expressed the view that the aim of the Israeli 
aggressions against Lebanon last July was to show that Israel 
would never allow any reconstruction in Lebanon and would not 
allow the government to begin the reconstruction process unless 
it concludes a peace agreement with Israel, but in practical 
terms the aggression achieved none of its objectives. He added: 
"True, it caused death and destruction but it achieved no 
political results because the people who had left their cities 
and villages in the south for a week have returned, thanks to 
the aid we received and the measures taken by the Lebanese 
state. There was one big united national workshop." 
  Asked if there is a chance that the company which undertook 
the reconstruction of the commercial center in Beirut 
(Solidaire) could operate nationwide in Lebanon after its 
success in Beirut, he replied: The law creating Solidaire was 
introduced for all Lebanon not just Beirut. It is a general law 
for the entire country and therefore there is nothing to prevent 
its being applied to other parts of Beirut and its suburbs and 
also to Jabal Lubnan and Tripoli but, as a government, we wanted 
to give the experiment in central Beirut its full range until it 
becomes a proven ssuccess, and it has been successful so far. 
The public want to see the achievements on the ground. I 
expect work to begin next summer opening the way for discussion 
of the possibility of implementing the Solidaire experiment in 
other areas. 
  Asked about the Lebanese currency improvement and whether 
that was based on confidence in the person of Prime Minister 
al-Hariri or other internal factors supporting the Lebanese 
pound, he replied: "It is difficult to pass judgment by saying 
that the matter was linked to the prime minister or to objective 
reasons because the currency issue has to do with confidence in 
the country. I should not be talking about this because it 
would be like someone talking about himself." 
  Did he sense in his talks with the British officials that 
European confidence in Lebanon has returned? He replied: 
"Actually, I rarely visit Britain but the impression I had 
before making this visit, which I was invited to make, was that 
British officials were interested in the Lebanese situation but 
what surprised me was the magnitude of that interest in Lebanon 
and their willingness to contribute. They seemed to me to be 
very serious and that, I believe, will have an effect on us. 
Britain is a large state and such interest on its part in 
Lebanon reflects Lebanon's worth." 
  He revealed that Lebanon received two offers from two major 
British companies to contribute to the work on and financing of 
Lebanon's electricity network restructuring. 
  He said that Britain is willing to help in the armament of 
the Lebanese Army and Internal Security Forces. He said: "We 
are talking not about building an army that wages war but about 
strengthening the Army and the Internal Security Forces so that 
they can discharge their security duties of maintaining general 
order." 
  Touching on domestic issues, al-Hariri said that the 
naturalization file has not been closed and is not linked to the 
question of Palestinian resettlement. He emphasized that the 
Lebanese citizenship law needs amending and that the government 
is serious about introducing the necessary amendments to enable 
the resolution of urgent cases. On the administrative purge, he 
said that that is an ongoing process that did not end with the 
dismissal of some employees. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri reaffirmed Lebanon's rejection of 
Palestinian resettlement on its territory and spoke of the 
negative effects that would have on the demographic, political, 
economic, and social fabric of the country. He pointed out that 
there is a provision in the Lebanese Constitution prohibiting 
resettlement in any form. He stressed that no such project can 
be imposed on Lebanon and nobody would sign anything of that 
kind under pressure or otherwise. He said that he has many 
ideas for the solution of the problem of the Palestinians in 
Lebanon and is ready to discuss them with any interested party. 
  In reply to a question about calls for the amendment of the 
Lebanese Constitution introduced under the al-Ta'if agreement, 
he said that his position is that he is in favor of developing 
the al-Ta'if formula and constitution for the better, not 
turning back the clock. He said that "nobody can stand in the 
way or reject development." He recalled what he recently said 
in the House of Deputies to the effect that he is in favor of a 
forward development of the al-Ta'if formula on the basis of 
coexistence, balance, and participation. 
  Al-Hariri will leave London today for Beirut via Istanbul 
where he will stop over at the airport for talks with his 
Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller which, according to sources 
close to al-Hariri, will focus on development and reconstruction 
issues he raised during his recent visit to Turkey a month ago. 
  The same sources say that he might also visit al-Qaradihah 
to 
attend the ceremony marking the passage of one week since the 
death of President Hafiz al-Asad's son Major Basil al-Asad.

  [Text] The eastern quarters of Kafr Tibnit and al-Nabatiyah 
al- Fawqah came under 12.7-mm machine-gun fire from the Israeli 
forces in Tallat 'Ali al-Tahir this morning. 
  The Israeli occupation forces today released three Lebanese 
and a Palestinian through the Red Cross. The Israeli Navy had 
seized them inside Lebanon's territorial waters. 
  The occupation forces also fired 16 shells, eight tank 
shells, and six mortars on Wadi Yatir. Helicopters fired more 
than 1,000 bullets at three fishermen, who were injured. 
  The UN Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] spokesman in the 
south has reported that two Swedish soldiers were wounded when a 
mine exploded in the al-Khiyam area. The leg of one soldier was 
amputated. An investigation into the incident has already 
started.

  [Text] Timor Goksel, official spokesman of the UN Interim 
Force in Lebanon, has announced that a preliminary investigation 
into the detonation of a land mine in the al-Kihyam area shows 
that while members of the Swedish contingent were carrying out 
maneuvers in a mine field, one of the soldiers made an error 
that triggered a mine explosion and injured three soldiers. 
  Goksel said that one of the wounded soldiers suffered grave 
injuries and was transferred to Haifa's Ramban Hospital. The 
other two were only slightly wounded, he said.

  [Text] Peshawar, Jan 26 -- As the fighting between rival 
Afghan factions continued for 26th day in Kabul it spread to all 
the northern provinces under the control of Militia Commander 
Gen Rashid Dostam with the claims of President Rabbani's forces 
to have scored victories against both the former Jonbesh-e Melli 
[National Movement] and Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan] of Hekmatyar. 
  The President Rabbani's sources quoting the General 
Committee 
member of HIA (H) [Hezb-e Eslami Afghanistan, Hekmatyar 
Faction], Ubaidollah Serat said that the latter along with other 
15 central leaders of HIA (H) and announced their dissociation 
from the fighting terming an alliance with communist Rashid 
Dostam as unholy one. Those they claimed dissociated from the 
fighting also included Deputy chief of HIA (H), Qazi Amin Waqad, 
central leaders Munshi Majid, Hussain Deljo, Qazl Najiullah and 
Prof Zara. 
  They also claimed that they had destroyed seven MIG planes 
of 
Rashid Dostam, Wednesday [26 January] took over more three posts 
from him in the north-east of Kabul city while 15 personnel 
fleeing from the latter's command were arrested by Maulavi 
Saddiqullah of Harekat-e Eslami [Islamic Movement]. They, 
however, said that rockets were continued to be fired at Kabul 
city throughout the day while in Baghlan Province the Commander 
of 54-Brigade of Rashid Dostam, namely Mohammad Ullah Nagar 
Joined Shora Nazar of Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, besides 500 personnel 
of HIA (H) led by commanders Abdol Ali, Jalal and Mirza Rahim 
also joined Mas'ud forces along with their weapons. 
  In Paryab province they said to have captured a huge 
quantity 
of heavy weapons from Rashid Dostam's forces. 
  On the other hand the HIA (H) has termed the visit of 
Najibollah Lafraie to Islamic Republic of Iran as very personal 
and should not be therefore, considered as a minister of state 
of Afghanistan. "Mr. Lafraie cannot speak on behalf of the 
government or state of Afghanistan nor he was empowered to sign 
any contract or memorandum or agreement on behalf of the 
government of Afghanistan". 
  They further alleged that an amount equal to 70 million 
dollars in different currencies was looted by the government 
forces when they captured Sraj Shahznda from HIA (H) and 
Jonbesh-e Melli forces. However, the commission appointed by 
President Rabbani headed by Gen Fahcem said in Kabul that 
according to its report the money changers had withdrawn their 
amount before they repulsed the attacks of HIA (H) and Jumbashi 
Milli. 
  Meanwhile, the Council for Understanding and National Unity 
of Afghanistan (comprising renowned commanders, tribal elders 
and noted religious scholars) have welcomed the UN Security 
Council's statement calling for an immediate cessation of 
hostilities. 
  In the open letter to the UN Secretary General, the Council 
noted with concern that for more than three weeks bloody battle 
was raging in the around Kabul where hundreds of innocent men, 
women and children were being killed mercilessly every day and 
forcing more than one hundred thousand defenceless Afghans to 
flee Kabul city in the severe winter. 
  The Council noted with regret that the UN Security Council's 
statement fell short of calling for an immediate cessation of 
foreign interference which was the root cause of the ongoing 
human tragedy in Afghanistan for in fact, intense and continuing 
foreign involvement in Afghan affairs by friendly and unfriendly 
powers as well as a myriad of well-financed fundamentalist 
organisations has precluded Afghans from finding their own 
solution. 
  They firmly believed that a Loya Jirga [Afghan Assembly] 
would have national legitimacy representing a broad spectrum of 
Afghan society lending to a broad-based political structure 
acceptable to the Afghan people. The letter said the Loya Jirga 
being a built-in mechanism in the traditional Afghan society has 
deep roots in the Afghan culture and it is an effective time 
honoured instrument for conflict resolution. The Council 
informed that it would not approve of the recent Pakistan's 
proposal for convening a regional conference on Afghanistan if 
it does not aim at calling for the UN involvement to promote a 
political settlement to the Afghan conflict. For the Afghans, 
the letter said have had highly disastrous results from all 
foreign brokered and sponsored accords namely the Peshawar 
Accord of April 24, 1992, the Islamabad Accord of March 7 1993, 
and the Jalalabad Accord of May 25, 1993, aimed at installing a 
fundamentalist dominated government in Kabul.

<F P=106> [By Nadeem Qadir] </F>
  [Text] Dhaka, Jan 23 (AFP) -- The attorney general who 
successfully prosecuted and sent to jail former Bangladesh 
president Hussain Mohammad Ershad has been removed, although he 
says he was not informed of the government's decision. 
  Lawyers also invariably described Aminul Haq's removal as 
"surprising," although he is known not to be a supporter of the 
ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). 
  The official BSS news agency announced late Saturday [22 
January] that "the government has appointed Additional Attorney 
General Abdul Wadud Khandakar as attorney general of Bangladesh 
in addition to his own duties, until further order." 
  Khandakar is known for his close links to the BNP. 
  The appointment, BSS said, was effective January 2 and had 
been approved by Bangladesh President Abdur Rahman Biswas as Haq 
was under medical treatment abroad. 
  But Haq said Sunday he had returned home last Monday and had 
met Biswas on Friday, yet was not informed of his removal and 
had continued to work as attorney general the last few days. 
  "I have not yet received any official letter and was 
surprised to hear the government announcement," he told AFP by 
telephone. 
  A top justice official confirmed the firing. "Yes, he (Haq) 
has been relieved of his responsibilities and papers are being 
processed to enable Khandakar to take full charge," the official 
said. 
  After hearing of his removal Haq said he was not going to 
the 
office Sunday, a normal working day in predominantly Muslim 
Bangladesh. 
  The ministry official refused to comment as to why Haq had 
not been informed. 
  Haq came to the limelight after successfully sending the 
deposed Ershad to jail for 20 years on weapons and graft 
charges, and was appointed attorney general by acting president 
Shahabuddin Ahmed's interim government in 1991. 
  One opposition member of parliament was quoted as saying 
that 
"he (Haq) did not join the government politically, but served 
his position well." 
  Khandakar told the daily MORNING SUN newspaper that he had 
received the order and had assumed the post of attorney general. 
  "The gentleman (Haq) was not in the country and in (his) 
absence an attorney general cannot handover charges to anyone," 
Khandakar said. "That is why it has been given retrospective 
effect, otherwise there would be a constitutional problem." 
  He said the president appoints the attorney general under a 
constitutional provision as recommended by the prime minister. 
  The former attorney general had offered to resign soon after 
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia came to power in March, 1991, but he 
was asked to carry on. He again offered to resign in April, 
1992, when the government charged 24 main organisers of a 
"peoples' court" for treason. 
  The mock "peoples' court" condemned Golam Azam, chief of the 
Moslem fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami party, to "death" for 
crimes allegedly committed during Bangladesh's 1971 independence 
war, but the government said the peoples' court action was not 
legal. 
  Haq, besides pursuing several more graft charges against 
Ershad, was also entangled in the citizenship case of Azam. A 
High Court bench last year restored Azam's citizenship, but Huq 
had appealed against it. 
  The former attorney general was reluctant to say much about 
his removal and replacement by a man who apparently enjoys 
closer political ties to the government. 
  Asked his feelings on the government decision, Haq replied: 
"I have no feelings."

General Abdul Wadud Khandakar has been given additional 
responsibility of Attorney General in the absense of incumbent

<F P=106> [Editorial: "False Propaganda -- Indian Style"] </F>
  [Text] The Bangladesh Rifles [border security force of 
Bangladesh] has termed as totally false, malicious, and 
calculated the report published in a section of the Indian press 
saying that a Pakistani intelligence agency is operating its 
bases in Bangladesh with the consent of the Bangladesh 
authorities with a view to carrying out subversive activities in 
India. Commenting on this propaganda made by the Indian media, 
a spokesman of the Bangladesh Rifles said that there are three 
objectives behind publishing this report. These include 1) 
confusing the Indian citizens, 2) diverting the attention of 
the international community from the fact that India is 
providing assistance to the Chakma rebels of Chittagong Hill 
Tracts of Bangladesh and 3) obstructing the development of 
friendly ties between India and her neighbors. 
  Except for Pakistan, all the other countries of the 
subcontinent are very weak in comparison to India. It is 
superior to these countries from all points of view including 
wealth, manpower, army, and weaponry. Almost every country of 
this subcontinent is aware of the superiority of India. Hence, 
the question does not arise that they will make any move to 
challenge India. These countries do not even dare to think of 
making any such a venture. Each of these countries wants to 
preserve its independence, sovereignty, national identity, 
history, and cultural traditions. For this reason, the 
fundamental principle of the foreign policy of Bangladesh is 
"friendship with all and malice toward none." Since its 
independence, Bangladesh has abided by this policy. However, it 
has not been possible for Bangladesh to live in peace despite 
its sincere desire. Its immensely powerful neighbor, India, is 
continuing with its repression against Bangladesh and subjecting 
it to various injustices. India's aggressive designs have 
created tension along the border of Bangladesh. With a view to 
disintegrating this country, India is providing shelter and 
providing arms training to the secessionist forces of Bangladesh 
known as Bangobhumiwallahs. These militants often intrude into 
the country and carry out subversive activities. Apart from 
this, by unilaterally withdrawing the waters of the Ganges 
River, India is causing immense hardship to Bangladesh both in 
the dry and the rainy seasons. It has also allured and provoked 
the Chakma tribals living in Chittagong Hill Tracts of 
Bangladesh to leave the country and take refuge in sanctuaries 
in India. It has also imparted arms training to the Chakmas who 
repeatedly carry out raids in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. This 
has threatened peace and stability in the Chittagong Hill Tracts 
region for a long time. Every move made by Bangladesh to find a 
permanent solution to the Chakma problem has been frustrated by 
India through its illegal intervention. Under these 
circumstances, the Indian media has launched a campaign saying 
that Bangladesh is collaborating with the activities of a 
Pakistani intelligence agency in India. What can be a greater 
farce than this? 
  In fact, the rebellion, tension, disturbances, and 
secessionist movements in the northeastern states of India is an 
old problem. With the passage of time, this problem has worsened 
and has become more severe. It is getting out of control and 
threatening regional stability. This is, however, an internal 
affair of India. A small country like Bangladesh never had the 
time to ponder the problems of a neighboring country. Moreover, 
the question of assisting any other country against India does 
not arise. Despite this, a section of the Indian media has 
leveled such allegations against Bangladesh. This is called the 
Indian style of false propaganda. It is entirely fabricated and 
malicious. This is their habit. They do not feel ashamed to do 
such things. However, it is true that they will gain nothing by 
doing so. By digging a ditch for others, they will fall into it 
themselves.

<F P=106> [By Mobaidur Rahman] </F>
  [Text] Implementation of the South Asian Preferential 
Trade Arrangement [SAPTA] agreement has become uncertain due to 
fears that India would dominate this proposed trading alliance. 
It has also been learned that reduction or abolition of tariff 
and customs duties on certain items decided to be traded under 
this arrangement has not been done, although the time limit 
fixed for this purpose has already expired. Diplomatic sources 
said that Pakistan did not attend several meetings of the 
committee formed to finalize the structure of the SAPTA. On one 
such occasion, Pakistan said that it was unable to attend the 
meeting as it was busy with the general elections and added that 
the government of Prime Minister Moin Qureshi cannot make any 
decision on SAPTA as it is a caretaker government. After the 
election of Benazir Bhutto as prime minister, another meeting of 
the SAPTA committee was held in Sri Lanka last November. 
Pakistan abstained from attending this meeting also but did not 
give any reason for it. Diplomatic sources said that the 
government of Benazir Bhutto believes that if the SAPTA accord 
is implemented then Indian products will capture the markets of 
the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] 
member countries. Apart from this, Pakistan is not interested 
in SAPTA, as it has found markets for its products in the West 
and Central Asian countries following the launching of the 
Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO]. For this reason, 
Pakistan is gradually losing its interest in SAPTA. 
  A Foreign Ministry source, who preferred to remain 
anonymous, 
disclosed that Pakistan was never interested in SAPTA. It has 
just complied with the requests made by other SAARC member 
countries to agree to the formation of the SAPTA. During the 
last SAARC summit held in Dhaka so many differences surfaced 
over the proposal for the launching of this trading forum that 
it was about to be dropped. The SAARC foreign ministers failed 
to reach a consensus on the issue. Later, the leaders of the 
SAARC countries who came to Dhaka to attend the summit managed 
to convince Pakistan to agree to the launching of the SAPTA 
during their river cruise on the Buriganga River in Dhaka. 
  However, after the SAARC summit, several countries, 
including 
Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, Afghanistan, and the newly emerged 
Muslim states of the former Soviet Union, took up large-scale 
programs for greater economic cooperation among them. As a 
result, Pakistan gradually became more inclined toward the ECO. 
It has been learned from a reliable source that the Iranian 
foreign minister during his visit to Dhaka last year invited 
Bangladesh to join the ECO, but it refused to accept the 
proposal. 
  It has been reported that when talks were being held in 
Dhaka 
regarding formulating the draft of the SAPTA, some of the 
members pointed out the economic disparity among the countries 
of the region. They cited that the level of economic and 
technological development was not the same in these countries, 
as the gap was very wide. Pakistan and India are at par, taking 
into consideration the economic growth rate and technological 
development in these two countries, but the level of economic 
development in the other SAARC member countries including 
Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Maldives is much below that of 
India and Pakistan. Bangladesh has nothing to trade with these 
two countries. Observers feel that the over-enthusiasm of 
Bangladesh to maintain its South Asian identity will make it 
totally dependent on India.

  [Text] The union home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, has 
reiterated that Rajiv Ganhi-Longowal accord [on Punjab] still 
holds good and will be implemented after total peace and 
normalcy returns to Punjab. Talking to newspersons after laying 
the foundation stone of a building complex at Chandigarh today, 
Mr. Chavan said Pakistan has launched an aggressive 
disinformation campaign about the alleged human rights 
violations in India. He pointed out that Pakistan itself is 
responsible for creating disturbing conditions by abetting 
terrorism in Punjab and some other parts of the country. Mr. 
Chavan stressed the need to counter this campaign by evolving a 
suitable strategy. Replying to a question about the future of 
Chandigarh, the home minister said that the prime minister is 
the competent authority to decide this. 
  Replying to a question on Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Chavan said 
the government is willing to have a dialogue with the militants 
there on the condition that they first give up violence. But 
the talks should be within the framework of the Indian 
Constitution, he added.

  [Text] India today denounced Pakistan for its reported 
rejection of New Delhi's six proposals on resolving bilateral 
issues. In response to a query, the External Affairs Ministry 
spokesman said in New Delhi today that though India has not yet 
received any formal response, it has the Pakistan Foreign 
secretary's statement in the press rejecting the proposals. He 
said if it is true, it is the final proof that there is no truth 
in Pakistan's claim that it only provides moral, diplomatic and 
political support to separatists and terrorists in Kashmir. He 
said Islamabad's refusal to discuss the proposals and the 
confidence-building measures gives a lie to their claim that 
they are not supporting terrorists on Indian soil. On the other 
hand, it has acknowledged that it will continue to send 
infiltrators and mercenaries in Kashmir to support terrorist 
activities. 
  The spokesman said if Pakistan genuinely wanted peace and 
dialogue, then there should be no objection to the proposals 
which also included a draft agreement on maintaining peace and 
tranquility on the Line of Control.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Kashmir Tangle"] </F>
  [Text] The information that Pakistan's military 
intelligence department, the Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI], 
is helping Kashmiri militants carry out terrorist and subversive 
activities in the state has not been provided by an Indian 
official in New Delhi but by the United States itself. This was 
stated in a report submitted recently before the U.S. House of 
Representatives. The report said Pakistani spies put on the 
uniform of Indian soldiers and indulged in subversive activities 
in Kashmir. After seeing this report, it will not be proper for 
U.S. officials to say that sufficient evidence does not exist to 
prove Indian allegations of Pakistani interference in Kashmir. 
Instead of expressing concern over the false allegations of 
human rights violations by Indian forces in Kashmir, Washington 
should ask Pakistan to stop meddling in the valley. If this is 
done then the peace-loving people of the state will give a sigh 
of relief. 
  Pakistani agents are not only active in Kashmir but also in 
other parts of India. There is hardly a place in the country 
where the ISI agents are not operating. According to the Home 
Ministry's intelligence reports, Pakistani spies were behind the 
explosions in Bombay and other places. They operate everywhere 
particularly in busy places such as streets, offices, markets, 
and crowded train compartments. These agents have already 
caused great losses to life and property. It may be true that 
the intelligence agency of the Indian Government, to hide their 
own inefficiency and failures, are shifting the blame for all 
mishaps onto Pakistan. But from the incidents occurring in 
Kashmir and other states it appears that Pakistan has a role in 
fomenting trouble and tension in this country. It seems very 
keen to encourage secessionist movements in Kashmir and in the 
northeastern region of the country by aiding militancy. 
  There is no doubt that tension along the border of Kashmir 
has increased manifold. Both the activities of the militants 
and the provocations created by Pakistani soldiers have 
simultaneously increased. The situation along the border has 
deteriorated to such an extent that the government has been 
compelled to ask the armed forces to remain on alert to render 
any assistance needed by the Border Security Force. An 
improvement in the situation cannot be expected as Islamabad is 
repeatedly threatening war and making statements that are not 
conducive to peace. It is unfortunate that in Pakistan 
anti-India statements are made for winning elections. This is 
understandable. But, till now the statements of Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto have not been encouraging. Benazir's position 
has become shaky due to stiff opposition from Nawaz Sharif on 
one hand and the severe family conflict on the other. But 
nothing serious has happened for which Benazir Bhutto should 
become upset or reckless. It will be good for Bhutto if she 
realizes this at the earliest. 
  It is difficult for New Delhi to give concessions to 
Islamabad. It has also not been possible for the Indian 
Government to take the necessary initiatives needed to normalize 
ties between the two countries. India should take steps to 
remove fear and mistrust from the mind of Pakistan. Surely both 
sides do not want another war. Not all problems can be resolved 
militarily. Steps are needed for a peaceful settlement of all 
disputes. It appears now that a political solution should be 
found to the Kashmir issue. The government is making efforts to 
bring about administrative changes in Kashmir in order to 
consolidate its position. But why are efforts being made to 
give so much importance to Dr. Farooq Abdullah [former chief 
minister of state] now? Is he very important politically? At 
present, neither him nor his party, called the National 
Conference, have the support of a majority of the population. 
No one will forget how he left the country and deserted his 
close associates in the time of danger. Why can't the 
government find a person in the state who enjoys the confidence 
of the people and who can help it find a political solution to 
the Kashmir tangle?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Serious Meaning of a Childish Threat"] </F>
  [Text] It would have been wrong to presume that Pakistan 
would sit silently after both sides agreed to disagree at the 
recent India-Pakistan foreign secretary-level talks. By putting 
conditions before the talks, Pakistan had already made its 
intentions clear that for the time being it is in no way 
interested in normalizing relations between the two countries. 
However, the warning given by Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar 
Asif Ali during his visit to Uzbekistan that a war may break out 
in South Asia cannot only be described as fuel to keep the 
controversy alive. The statement has been given under a 
well-planned policy which aims on the one hand to keep public 
opinion in Pakistan with the government, and on the other to 
inform the comunity of nations that if it did not keep in view 
the Pakistani interests, the situation may well get out of 
control. 
  As reported, the Pakistan foreign minister during his stay 
in 
Uzbekistan has drawn a blueprint of nuclear war in South Asia. 
He has threatened that if the Kashmir controversy is not 
settled in line with Pakistani interests, India and Pakistan may 
go to war for the fifth time and that nuclear arms may be used. 
The threat, perhaps, is given to underline that a desperate 
Pakistan can resort to anything at its disposal. It is true 
that in terms of international diplomacy such threats can only 
be described as childish, but it cannot be fully ignored in view 
of the the way Pakistan has been constantly hurting Indian 
interests. By assisting terrorists in Punjab and Kashmir, 
Pakistan has only shown its hostile attitude against India. 
Pakistan was also behind the bomb blasts in Bombay last year. 
Evidence has often come to light about Pakistan's encouragement 
of communal violence in various places in India. Hence, the 
Pakistan foreign minister's threat should be taken seriously, 
not because we should be afraid of Pakistan's so-called nuclear 
capability, but because of the fact that Pakistan has launched a 
diplomatic offensive against India. We are capable of 
confronting Pakistan's military might and this has been proven 
many times in the past. Today, however, the need is not as much 
about displaying our military strength as showing diplomatic 
skill and capability. 
  Our biggest need today is to clearly define our objectives 
and put them before the world in no uncertain terms. This is 
all the more imperative if the world is to view the Indian stand 
in the right perspective regarding Kashmir. We have to make it 
clear that Kashmir is an integral part of India and that we are 
ready to take all steps to defend our territorial integrity. We 
also must explain to the world how normal life has been 
disrupted in Kashmir due to Pakistani-sponsored terrorism. The 
way Pakistan is abetting terrorism is no less than any war by 
itself. In such a situation, India not only has to make its 
stand clear, but it must categorically state that its policy 
objectives are not surrounded by a mist of uncertainties. Our 
attitude should not reflect a lack of self-confidence. This is 
essential to project our stand to the world community. We also 
cannot ignore the fact that countries like the United States 
want to view Kashmir issues from the Pakistani viewpoint. This 
is why it is necessary that we become more active on the 
diplomatic front than in the past. While on the one hand it is 
essential to make it known to Pakistan that India cannot be 
cowed down by threats, on the other it is also essential to 
explain to world opinion that Pakistan's stand regarding Kashmir 
is not only illogical, but dangerous as well. The language of 
threats being used by Pakistan may well be childish, but it is 
also full of dangerous consequences. The Pakistan Government 
could resort to any adventure to strengthen its position within 
the country. This is why it is all the more necessary that we 
clearly define our stand regarding Pakistan and avoid ad hoc 
policies. Vacillation will create doubt about our polices which 
will weaken our stand. Our aim should be clear and our sight 
straightforward.

  [Text] Agartala, January 23: The repatriation of 54,000 
Chakma refugees of Chittagong Hill Tracts [CHT's] of Bangladesh, 
who are living in camps in the Tripura state of India for the 
past seven years will start 15 February. In the first phase of 
the repatriation process, a total of 400 refugee families will 
be sent back to their homes in Bangladesh. The remaining 
refugees will be repatriated in phases. This was decided at a 
meeting held between the representatives of the Bangladesh 
Government and the tribal refugees on January 16 in Ramgarh 
District of Bangladesh. The tribals agreed to go back after 
being assured that their preconditions would be fulfilled by the 
Bangladesh government. 
  The decision of the tribals to go back to Bangladesh was 
conveyed by the leader of the tribal delegation to the recently 
held talks, Upendra Lal Chakma, when he called on the Tripura 
governor, Romesh Bhandari, in Agartala today. Meanwhile, work 
has already started with a view to prepare the list of the 400 
families to be repatriated in the first phase. It may be 
mentioned that these tribals started fleeing from CHT's in 1986 
due to the repression launched against them and took refuge in 
camps located in the southern part of Tripura. 
  The following preconditions given by the tribal delegation 
were accepted by the representatives of the Bangladesh 
government during the meeting held on January 16: 1) the 
government agreed to protect the life and property of the 
refugees, return their lands, and ensure their proper 
rehabilitation; 2) representatives of the Refugee Welfare 
Assocation based in Tripura will be allowed to visit CHT's to 
see for the themselves the rehabilitation of the refugees who 
will be repatriated in the first phase; and 3) repatriation of 
the remaining refugees will depend on the progress made in the 
talks between the Bangladesh government and the representatives 
of the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samity [Chittagong Hill 
Tracts People's Solidarity Council] on bringing about a 
political settlement of the CHT's tangle. 
  The Tripura governor, Romesh Bhandari, has welcomed the 
decision made by the tribal refugees to go back to their 
country. It may be mentioned that he played a important role in 
this regard. Bhandari became acquainted with the Chakma refugee 
problem during the period when he was the foreign secretary of 
India. He took personal initiative to expedite the repatriation 
of the refugees since he took over as the governor of Tripura. 
In this regard, he also held discussions with the central 
government in Delhi.

Organization, ISRO, Professor U.R. Rao, stressed the need for 
evolving cost-effective and more reliable system for the 
country's space program. Opening a seminar on propulsion system 
in Thiruvananthapuram today, he said that the thrust should be 
on the total development of technology at an affordable cost. 
Professor Rao said the reliability rate of the country's space 
system is 91 to 92 percent. The immediate priority should be to 
raise it to the level of 95 to 96 percent, and only then, the 
country can claim to have a system that is considered reliable, 
he added.

  [Text] Qom, Jan. 27, IRNA -- Secretary of Iran's Supreme 
National Security Council (SNSC), Dr. Hasan Rowhani, says 
despite the world power's becoming unipolar by the United 
States, the Islamic Republic of Iran has not changed its 
policies. 
  Speaking to theologians in a mosque here Wednesday night, he 
said "despite all efforts launched by the U.S. to conspire 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iran's policies formulated 
by the late Imam Khomeyni are successfully going ahead." 
  Rowhani who is the chief of Majles Foreign Policy Committee 
and the leader's representative at SNSC, said the United States 
has suffered defeat in post-Soviet era in international and 
regional arena and after the admission by Russia that they have 
failed in their plans. 
  He said the hard efforts of the U.S. to persuade Europe and 
Japan not to cooperate with Iran in economic and commercial 
areas have failed. He deplored the U.S. for raising a ballyhoo 
on Iran's foreign debts by giving unrealistic figures which he 
said had failed to reach anywhere. 
  Answering a question on Iran's relations with the 
neighbouring countries, Rowhani said ties with Turkey are 
satisfactory. In light of national and security issues, Turkey 
has no other way but to maintain growing relations with Iran and 
"we welcome friendly relations with Ankara." 
  On relations with Iraq, he said if grounds are provided for 
Iraq in the international arena, Baghdad would be willing to 
consolidate ties with Tehran. However, he added, it was Iran's 
natural right to respond severely to the armed attempts by 
counterrevolutionary groups outside the borders. 
  On ties with the Persian Gulf littoral states, he said Iran 
employed logical ways is to settle its problems with these 
states in order to foil U.S. attempts to bring discord into the 
Persian Gulf. 
  He described Iran's relations with Pakistan as excellent and 
on Afghanistan, he said Iran was the only mediator in the 
conflict. He said the prospect of relations with Afghanistan 
was promising. 
  On the fall in oil prices, he said lower oil prices can 
prompt a new mechanism to cut off dependence on oil and pave the 
way for economic growth through non-oil exports. 
  Rowhani said Iran's non-oil exports reached dlrs. 5,000 
million [figure as received] this year. The figure is expected 
to reach dlrs. [dollars] 6,000 million next year, he said. 
  He put emphasis on Iran's relations with Saudi Arabia and 
said issues including oil, presence of foreign forces in the 
Persian Gulf, and Hajj pilgrimage entitled Tehran to strengthen 
mutual relations with Riyadh.

  [Text] The fourth and final stage of the great Victory-3 
maneuvers began in the blue waters of northern Persian Gulf this 
morning with the extensive participation of units under the 
joint command of the [Islamic Revolution Guards] Corps [IRGC], 
the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the popular forces. 
  In this stage of the maneuvers, initially a divers' 
exploration team attacked the jetties of an imaginary enemy and 
while destroying support vessels tied up at the docks, passed 
through defensive positions and mine fields. 
  The operating forces, in a lightning attack on military 
installations on the island, including radar, listening, and 
[word indistinct] posts, destroyed a substantial portion of the 
enemy's radar capacity. 
  In the final stage of the Victory-3 maneuvers the heavy 
artillery of the Guards and [military] equipment company, with 
their heavy, precise, and extensive fire on enemy positions, 
installations, and the beach jetty, prevented the vessels of the 
imaginary enemy from aproaching these areas. 
  At the same time as these operations, the joint IGRC-Army 
mine-layers blocked all entrances and sensitive areas with 
various marine mines of extremely high sensitivity. Meanwhile, 
the fighter-bombers of the army of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
using the best tactical actions, identified attacking vessels 
and, coordinating with missile sites, took action to ensure 
their destruction. 
  While bombarding the positions of the imaginary enemy, the 
Kousar brigade warship and the Qader support vessel, supported 
by the heavy fire of the army's gunships, began their thunderous 
attacks. 
  The marine brigade and the commando brigade of the navy of 
the Guards Corps, together with the army's armored units and 
supported by the tanks and armored vehicles of the Guards Corps' 
land forces, executed a lightning attack on the island and 
captured the first defenses of the imaginary enemy. 
  Meanwhile, in order to speed up operations and to capture 
the 
island, companies of the IRGC commando brigade, landed from 
helicopters beyond enemy lines and carried out their tactical 
military operations.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime minister of the Zionist 
regime, has announced that his regime has no intention of a 
military withdrawal from the Gaza-Jericho autonomous region for 
at least another three months. This announcement of the stance 
of the Zionist regime has once again contradicted Yasir 
'Arafat's optimism. 
  'Arafat had hoped that after the Zionist regime's violation 
of its earlier promise to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho, he 
would be able to be in charge of the internal affairs of the 
Gaza-Jericho autonomous region within the next month and a half. 
Mockingly, Rabin said that one should congratulate an 
optimistic person such as Yasir 'Arafat. 
  The prime minister of the Zionist regime has indirectly 
admitted that there is a feeling of disappointment and despair 
among the Palestinians regarding the process of the compromise. 
However, the disappointment and despair of the Palestinians is 
a double-edged sword, one side of which is turned towards 
'Arafat and the other is aimed against the Zionist regime. 
  When 'Arafat signed the autonomy accord, he portrayed a 
false 
picture of it for the Palestinians who were under the oppression 
of the Zionist regime. He tried to give rise to this false hope 
that after decades of struggle there would be a Palestinian 
state, at least within the limited area of the Gaza Strip and 
the West Bank, and that the noble Qods [Jerusalem] would be the 
capital of the Palestinian state. In addition to that, with the 
creation of a Palestinian state, the Palestinian refugees would 
be able to return to their land and all Palestinians prisoners 
would be set free. 
  However, now, four months after the signing of the accord 
and 
after the shattering of the veils of deception and the crushing 
of the weak foundations of the hope built upon 'Arafat's false 
promises, all that is left of the accord is despair and 
despondency among the Palestinians. This has led to an 
escalation of the Islamic intifadah of the Palestinians. 
  'Arafat has lost most of his popular and administrative 
support, as well as his political and revolutionary legitimacy, 
without having in practice gained anything from Israel. In the 
same way, Israel has lost many of its winning cards without 
being able to ensure the security of the occupiers and without 
harming the intifadah whose flames she has tried very hard to 
extinguish. In fact, Israel's strongest card, which has now 
been used and has been made worthless, is 'Arafat himself. 
  Now it has been made clear to the Palestinians that, 
contrary 
to the false hopes that 'Arafat had aroused, there will be no 
Palestinian state or government as the result of the autonomy 
accord. Israel, which has used the size of the Jericho region 
as an excuse for the nonimplementation of the accord, will never 
give up other occupied territories including the West Bank and 
noble Qods. Furthermore, Zionist settlements will remain in the 
autonomous regions as the military outposts of the occupying 
regime and as bases for ensuring the continued military and 
political presence of that regime. Communications between the 
autonomous region and the outside world will also continue to be 
under the control and supervision of the Zionist regime. 
  As regards 'Arafat's occasional statements about Jerusalem 
being the capital of the Palestinian state, it is sufficient to 
refer to Rabin's warnings and his arrogant telling off of 
'Arafat during the talks in Cairo to make it clear that it has 
been nothing but a propaganda ploy by 'Arafat. 
  The fact that on the basis of the accord the return of many 
millions of Palestinian refugees who left the occupied 
territories in 1948 is out of the question, and that the return 
of the refugees who left in 1967 is also conditional, 
demonstrates that the Gaza- Jericho Accord was indeed signed 
against the interests of several million Palestinian refugees. 
  Now, there is only 'Arafat, Israel, and many dashed hopes. 
Israel is trying to ensure the security of the occupiers at the 
expense of all those dashed hopes. Consequently, she refrains 
from withdrawing by resorting to various excuses. However, this 
has further inflamed the rage of the Palestinians and has 
further intensified the intifadah, as a result of which the 
prospects for the security of the occupying regime have also 
become much dimmer. 
  The approach of the Palestinian strugglers has even 
encouraged the members of 'Arafat's Fatah movement to gradually 
separate their paths from that of 'Arafat and to turn toward the 
successful experiment of the Islamic intifadah.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 27 (AFP)--The presence of two million 
Afghan refugees in Iran has drained the country's resources and 
poses a threat to its national security, an Iranian newspaper 
warned on Thursday. 
  Responding to an appeal from the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees Sadako Ogata for a halt to the repatriation of refugees 
from Iran and Pakistan, the English-language TEHRAN TIMES said 
the Islamic republic was no longer able or "obliged" to host 
them. 
  "The nature of the Afghan refugee problem has changed since 
the liberation of the country from the former Soviet Union," it 
said. "The world should not expect us to treat the refugees with 
the same urgency when they are victims of factional infighting 
in their country." 
  The paper warned Iran's national security was "threatened" 
and that the country could no longer afford spending its 
resources on the large number of refugees there. 
  "Our security forces are engaged daily in clashes with 
Afghan 
drug smugglers disguised as refugees," it said. "What would 
Western countries do under the same circumstances?" 
  The Afghan capital Kabul has been hit by a new surge in 
fighting since January 1, which has left some 10,000 people dead 
or wounded and forced thousands to flee the country. 
  Troops loyal to President Borhanoddin Rabbani have been 
pitted in a fierce battle against combined forces of 
Uzbek-Pashtun warlord Abdol Rashid Dostam and Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar. 
  Ogata warned on Tuesday that the civil war raging in 
Afghanistan could trigger a new influx of refugees into Iran and 
Pakistan and called for a halt in the repatriation process. 
  Her message was contained in a letter read out to ministers 
at a meeting of the 10-member Economic Cooperation Organisation 
(ECO) in Tehran. 
  Ogata said she did not expect the international community to 
fund the repatriation process as long as fighting threatened the 
lives of the returnees. 
  She warned of the "tendency of many governments to close 
their borders when faced with the threat of refugee influxes," 
and called for borders to remain open for "people who require 
international protection." 
  With UNHCR help Iran and Pakistan have stepped up efforts to 
repatriate Afghan refugees who fled the 14-year civil war in 
Afghanistan. Iran says the refugees have been encouraged but 
not forced to return.

  [Text] Gaza -- Last night Fatah issued a press release on 
recent Israeli practices in the Gaza Strip. In its statement, 
Fatah stressed that it views with gravity recent Israeli 
practices in the occupied territories, the culmination of which 
was the recent campaign of detentions in the Gaza Strip. 
  The statement referred to opening fire on residents in 
Jabalyah last Saturday [22 January], the demolition of houses in 
Rafah, the detentions that have covered most areas of the Gaza 
Strip, and the campaign of confiscating magnetic identity cards 
from hundreds of workers without any justification. 
  The statement emphasized that the Israeli side is incapable 
of proving its credibility and seriousness with respect to the 
current peace process. In its statement, Fatah called on the 
Israeli authorities to immediately release all prisoners, 
especially the sick, the elderly, and those who have spent long 
periods in detention, without discriminating against one people. 
The statement also called on the authorities to release 
fugitives who were detained after the signing of the Declaration 
of Principles and to return recently revoked identity cards to 
hundreds of workers. 
  In conclusion, Fatah stated that the Israeli side should 
immediately stop these practices, which will have a negative 
effect on the negotiating process.

  [Excerpt] Amman, QUDS PRESS -- Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, 
former head of the Palestinian delegation to the bilateral peace 
talks, has called on the Palestinian leadership to form a 
national authority council in the Gaza Strip and another one in 
the West Bank. In a memorandum submitted to the PLO Executive 
Committee, 'Abd-al-Shafi said that in light of the evolving 
situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, particularly after 
the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles 
accord, the requirements of the transfer of power, and other 
matters related to the implementation of the accord, we see a 
need to set up a national authority council in the Gaza Strip 
and another one in the West Bank. This council should consist 
of respected local nationalist personalities who enjoy national 
credibility and high moral standards and who represent various 
sectors of the social and political fabric. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who recently led the reformers' 
delegation 
to Tunis, defined the authority's tasks as follows: 
  It will be the only national and local authority and the 
local address of the PLO. 
  It will be the only channel of contact with the PLO. 
  It will serve as an advisory body to the Palestinian 
leadership on all local matters, above all by giving its opinion 
regarding the transfer of powers and other matters stemming from 
the Declaration of Principles and its implementation. 
  It will carry out all other tasks in its capacity as a 
national and local authority council. 
  It will coordinate among the various bodies should this be 
necessary. 
  The memorandum submitted by 'Abd-al-Shafi suggested that 
this 
authority continue in its tasks until elections are held. It 
also proposed that the PLO Executive Committee form a small 
preparatory committee, comprised of personalities from inside, 
to set up this authority. 
  Dr. Taysir 'Aruri, member of the Palestinian People's Party 
political bureau, has said that 'Abd-al-Shafi's demand enjoys 
his party's support and that of FIDA [Palestinian Democratic 
Union], Fatah's partners in the Palestinian leadership. He 
pointed out that Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive 
Committee and FIDA's leader, supported this idea during the 
Palestinian leadership's meetings, but the proposal was rejected 
by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Democratic Front Urges Speeding up </F>
Formation of Islamic National Leadership of Intifadah"] 
  [Text] Damascus, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] led by Nayif Hawatimah 
has called for the holding of popular conferences and the 
formation of the Islamic National Leadership of the intifadah in 
implementation of the decisions taken at the first meeting of 
the Palestinian Forces Alliance, held in Damascus 10 January. 
  An authoritative DFLP source has said that the central 
leadership of the alliance decided to begin immediately to hold 
popular conferences inside [the occupied territories] and in the 
diaspora as an important step toward stripping the bureaucratic 
PLO leadership of legitimacy and in preparation for holding the 
general people's national conference, which will elect a new 
political leadership for the Palestinian leadership and rebuild 
PLO institutions on democratic foundations. 
  The source believes that beginning to implement this 
decision 
will be considered a practical measure of the extent of the 
alliance's seriousness in its new form. 
  The source also pointed out that the central leadership of 
the alliance had stressed the decision to form the Islamic 
National Leadership of the Intifadah in the occupied Palestinian 
territories -- which requires that all parties concerned hasten 
to implement it immediately. This is in the knowledge that the 
present leadership of the intifadah is formed from the DFLP and 
the Popular Front [for the Liberation of Palestine], as the 
forces involved in the Oslo-Washington agreement have abandoned 
it. 
  On the central leadership's other decisions concerning 
organizational and administrative aspects, the source said that 
these decisions become valuable when they help to effect the 
alliance's political role, specifically in two main spheres: 
holding popular conferences and expanding the intifadah 
leadership so as to include the other parties of the alliance 
operating in the occupied homeland which are still outside this 
unionist framework.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Slip of Tongue From al-Hariri?"] </F>
  [Text] Rafiq al-Hariri's success in making billions 
[currency not specified] from his private businesses in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and using these billions as a passport 
to reach premiership in Lebanon does not mean that he is a 
successful politician. Because politics is a science that has 
its own rules and basic elements. Of course, money is one of 
the elements, but not the only one. 
  Al-Hariri arrived in London and was very warmly received by 
some Lebanese and Palestinians. he held press conferences and 
delivered lectures in his capacity as a rich man first and a 
prime minister second. He was successful in most of them. But 
success failed him in one of them, specifically at the press 
conference held at the foreign correspondents association. 
  In this conference al-Hariri focused on his country's 
refusal 
to settle Palestinians in Lebanon. He stressed this point at 
great length, as though the Palestinians are just refugees, not 
Arabs also. Maybe they are not human. Al-Hariri tends to 
forget that he is from Sidon (unless he still insists that he is 
from al-Dar'iyah [as transliterated]), which is a few kilometers 
from Palestinian 'Akko. 
  It might be useful to recall that the people of Sidon, Tyre, 
and southern Lebanon have always been an extension of the people 
of Galilee and the Palestinian coast, and vice versa, to the 
extent that it is difficult to distinguish between them in terms 
of features, customs, and traditions. 
  But al-Hariri, who holds Saudi nationality, although he is 
Lebanese, and is enjoying all its privileges, is using a 
non-pan-Arab -- we would not say racist -- language when dealing 
with Palestinians. Because he thinks that their might has been 
destroyed and that he can through foreign aid flex his muscles 
on them whenever he wants. 
  We assure al-Hariri that the Palestinians are guests of the 
Lebanese, just as they are guests of the Syrians, Jordanians, 
and all the other Arabs. They appreciate the patience and 
generosity of their hosts. And they have not asked to be 
settled, because nothing can replace their homeland, otherwise 
they would not have become strugglers and fighters. 
  The point which attracted our attention most in his press 
conference was when he said he would consider an application to 
be submitted by Palestinian President 'Arafat to visit Lebanon, 
hence indicating that the Palestinian president needs a visa 
from the nearest Lebanese consul to make the visit in question, 
while other Palestinian leaders do not get the same treatment 
when they enter Lebanon. 
  Regrettably, these unsuccessful statements, which lack the 
simplest political and diplomatic rules, came in reply to an 
optimistic question suggesting that the problem of President 
'Arafat's visit to Lebanon was resolved the moment he was 
received in Riyadh by the Saudi monarch, King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. But al-Hariri -- because of lack of 
experience or information -- "maybe" did not understand the 
significance. He failed to seize the opportunity to improve his 
government's position toward an Arab leader who only did what 
al-Hariri wants to do but cannot, that is sign a peace agreement 
with Israel. 
  It saddens us -- and we know the situation in Lebanon and 
the 
independence of al-Hariri's government -- to hear these 
unsuccessful statements, which do not reflect a realistic and 
correct political reading of the rapid developments in the Arab 
region, the most recent of which is the Palestinian president's 
visit to Damascus and Riyadh and the historic meeting held in 
Geneva less than two weeks ago between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad 
and Bill Clinton. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri needs a pause for examination and a 
thorough revision of his positions, especially on the 
Palestinian issue and people -- a pause that matches the depth 
of the relationship between the Lebanese and Palestinian 
peoples, which was built on joint sacrifices for the sake of 
bolstering the issues of Arabism, first and foremost the 
Lebanese and Palestinian issues.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Shlomo Ganor and Eli Nisan; date not given; from the weekly 
"Encounter" program -- recorded in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; 
processed from the Hebrew] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Nisan] What is expected to 
take place in your upcoming talks with Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Peres] We will make a supreme effort to reach agreement on 
the issues still in dispute. Also, I believe we will prepare 
for the following meetings. In the meeting we had in Oslo we 
discussed two important issues: One, regarding the elections, I 
told Mr. 'Arafat that if the Palestinians decide, for example, 
to hold municipal elections before holding general elections, 
naturally we will not oppose this. It is their decision to 
make. The other issue, which I proposed and which was accepted, 
was that the negotiations about early empowerment [last two 
words in English] will be held in Taba following the current 
negotiations. Naturally, Jericho will then be, to a large 
extent, its administrative center. 
  [Ganor] Did you get a positive reply to your suggestion that 
the elections to the municipal and rural councils be held prior 
to the elections to the autonomy council? 
  [Peres] I have not received a reply to that yet, but I 
believe that they view it positively. I received a positive 
reply regarding the issue of early empowerment. 
  [Nisan] Seeing the difficulties in the negotiations with the 
PLO, how involved is Mubarak, and Egypt in general, in the 
attempts to bring the Israeli and the PLO stands closer to 
attaining the implementation of the agreement? 
  [Peres] The Egyptians are certainly trying to play a 
constructive role, which today is called a facilitator [last 
word in English]. Sometimes it also helps. For example, last 
time we were in Cairo for negotiations, they were concluded in 
President Mubarak's office. In fact, he chaired the meeting. 
There we agreed that I and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] go out to 
meet the press together and report on the agreements made by the 
two delegations. I did just that, and Mr. Abu-Mazin stood at my 
side and confirmed my remarks. They are called the Cairo 
understandings. 
  [Ganor] Will the differences be really settled in Davos? 
  [Peres] I am not certain. I cannot make guesses. Talks are 
being held in Cairo at this very minute to search for a way out. 
Some of the work was done there, although I am afraid that a lot 
of work was left for the two of us in Davos. 
  [Nisan] What do you feel as you prepare to leave for Davos 
this evening? The impression is that the optimism of the past 
is today somewhat qualified and you are more careful in your 
optimistic remarks? 
  [Peres] I have always been careful regarding dates and 
places because it does not only depend on us or me. Basic 
strategic optimism has prevailed, but it is not only up to our 
side to bridge all the gaps. 
  [Nisan] Are you not trying to lower expectations toward the 
meeting in Davos? 
  [Peres] That is because some people have downplayed the 
importance of the existing differences -- they are not simple, 
but are serious. We are working hard to find previously untried 
solutions. The past solutions were not good enough either. 
  [Ganor] Does that mean that 13 April -- the forecasted date 
for the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho -- is not realistic? 
  [Peres] It is hard to tell. If we really finalize things in 
Davos, we could perhaps meet this date. If not, it will take 
another month. 
  [Ganor] This means that there are no longer sacred dates? 
  [Peres] There are dates we have agreed upon. Agreed-upon 
things are sacred. According to the agreement, we have to 
complete the withdrawal four months after the agreement is 
signed. It has not yet been signed. Thus, we always have four 
months from that date to work. [passage omitted] 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, with your permission we will move on to 
discuss the Syrian track. Has Israel indeed received an 
unequivocal explanation from Syria that it is prepared to reach 
a separate agreement with Israel that will stand on its own? 
  [Peres] What we have been told exactly is that the Syrians 
are prepared to conduct Syrian-Israeli negotiations. In other 
words, the negotiation process itself will stand on its own. We 
still do not know what the outcome will be. However, I would 
like to tell you something. Speaking for myself, I accept the 
Syrian challenge. Mr. al-'Allaf, the head of the Syrian 
delegation told our chief negotiator Itamar Rabinovich that 
al-Asad had spoken in Geneva not as Syria's ruler but as the 
leader of the whole Arab world. Okay. Let al-Asad bring peace 
to the entire Arab world, not just to us. When the Arabs speak 
of a comprehensive peace they are including everything Israel 
has included. A comprehensive peace includes everything that is 
part of the Arab world. It is about time that all the Arab 
countries, except for the three rogue states -- Iraq, Iran, and 
Libya -- sit down at the negotiating table together with 
al-Asad, establish diplomatic relations with Israel, open 
borders and markets, etc. 
  [Ganor] Was Israel satisfied with this Syrian explanation? 
  [Peres] The Syrians have not said this yet. I say that 
Israel must state that a comprehensive peace does not only 
pertain to Israel's assets but also to the attitude of the Arab 
world and diplomatic relations with Israel. 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, what if the negotiations with Syria take 
a long time, in light of the obstacles and differences between 
both parties' positions? Do you see any possibility of reaching 
an interim accord with the Syrians prior to a comprehensive 
peace agreement? 
  [Peres] I doubt that Syria will agree to this. Perhaps 
Israel could consider it but I do not see Syria going for it. 
Look, I think we have to either achieve a comprehensive peace 
or negotiate with each party on a separate basis. We must 
differentiate between separate and successive negotiations with 
each party and the peace that will eventually encompass all the 
parties and enable us to build a new Middle East. 
  [Ganor] Which steps should be taken in order to accelerate 
the negotiations between Syria and Israel? Would you recommend 
a summit meeting between foreign ministers or heads of 
government? 
  [Peres] The psychological dimension must undoubtedly be 
considered. The negotiations should be opened up on all sides 
and both formal and informal contacts should be held. The 
difference between civil servants and ministers, for example, is 
that the latter enjoy one privilege: They can make mistakes. 
In negotiations you must have people that can make mistakes 
because if you only send people who are forbidden to err, the 
negotiations will not make progress. Today, the negotiations 
are being held on one narrow track, infested with microphones, 
and the echo is louder than the actual words. Anything that is 
said reverberates far more than warranted. 
  [Ganor] How would you sum up this week of talks in 
Washington on the Syrian track? 
  [Peres] The talks were held in a positive atmosphere but not 
much progress was made. 
  [Nisan] Mr. Peres, on the basis of the Egyptian precedent, 
would you support stationing U.S. troops between the Syrian and 
Israeli armies in order to promote the negotiations with Syria? 
  [Peres] I think that with Syria, just as was the case with 
Egypt, we must first make a supreme effort to create a situation 
in which we will not need to station any foreign troops. Then 
we shall see. You know, in the Egyptian case, the idea of 
stationing U.S. troops was not so much an essential element of 
the peace itself, it was more like the final validation. So let 
us first achieve peace and then we will seek a way to give it a 
final stamp of approval. 
  [Ganor] How involved is the United States in this respect? 
Did they offer their good services this week? 
  [Peres] First of all, the Americans are the ones who are 
urging both parties to meet. They are trying to bridge the 
difficulties both parties encounter along the way, and the 
United States is playing the role of an honest broker [last two 
words in English]. 
  [Ganor] Last night we saw this when King Husayn appeared at 
Secretary of State Christopher's side. Yesterday, King Husayn 
publicly admitted for the first time that he had met with all 
Israeli prime ministers, including yourself Mr. Peres, except 
for the late Menahem Begin. What is your reaction to his 
professed readiness to publicly meet with the Israeli prime 
minister? 
  [Peres] I attach great importance to this. One of the 
drawbacks in Israel's relationship with Jordan -- a relationship 
which also has many advantages -- has always been this coyness 
and timidity, as though peace is something that should be kept 
secret. You know, the Jordanians were furious on numerous 
occasions when Israel leaked the news of the meetings. 
  [Ganor] For example, on 3 November when you met with.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] Now people are starting to understand 
what happened then. 
  [Ganor] So what happened then? 
  [Peres] Patience. You will have to wait a little bit more 
for me to reveal all my secrets. On the other hand, we told the 
Jordanians that it is time to legitimize peace. What must be 
hidden here? At least we can reveal things about the peace 
negotiations. In my opinion, a very important step forward has 
now been taken. It is the second step because the first step 
was the meeting between Crown Prince Hasan and myself at the 
White House together with President Clinton. Both Jews and 
Arabs, Jordanians and Israelis, should be shown that peace is 
nothing to be ashamed about and there is no need to hide it and 
to act as though it was some kind of underground activity. 
Peace is a great hope that should be expressed proudly so it 
can influence everyone, and I am convinced that despite the 
presence of some religious fanatics in Jordan, most Jordanian 
citizens support peace. I was very impressed with the level of 
culture and education among the Jordanian people. 
  [Ganor] Could you tell us what kind of impression the 
Jordanian monarch left on you following your meetings? 
  [Peres] He left an excellent impression of a very serious 
and experienced man, full of goodwill, in control of all the 
facts and of himself. I believe him to be a man who really 
prays for peace and yearns for it from the depth of his heart. 
  [Ganor] The question is when. Did you receive any 
indication of that in your last meeting with him on 3 November? 
  [Peres] As far as King Husayn is concerned, the question of 
when is tied to other constraints. We constantly say that we 
are surrounded by certain neighbors. He is also surrounded by 
neighbors, but we only have eyes for our own problems. I can 
say only one thing: One does not choose one's parents or 
neighbors. What one can choose is the relationship between 
neighbors and between parents and children. We are not going to 
change the fact that we are neighbors but we are going to change 
our relationship. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres left a short time 
ago for the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where he will meet with 
PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat tomorrow. Jerusalem believes Davos 
will not be the last station in the negotiations with the 
Palestinians. A member of the Israeli delegation to the Swiss 
talks forecasted last night that 'Arafat and Peres will not sign 
any agreement tomorrow. This evaluation is based on the reports 
from Cairo that the drafting team, headed by Uri Savir and 
Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], did not reach understandings. 
Following two days of preparatory talks, the teams managed to 
produce only a document detailing the points of agreement and 
disagreement between the PLO and Israel. The two main points of 
disagreement are still the border crossings -- in particular 
Israel's demand to inspect suspicious-looking Palestinians 
passing through the crossings -- and Jericho's jurisdiction. 
  Peres and 'Arafat will meet tomorrow, but they may hold 
preliminary talks today to try to overcome the points in 
dispute. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had a tete-a-tete meeting 
with Foreign Minister Peres last night prior to Peres' departure 
for Davos today. Rabin is firm in his opposition to any 
concessions or further flexibility on security issues. That is 
the position Peres presented to 'Arafat in Oslo, and although 
the atmosphere there was optimistic, the evaluations regarding 
Davos are more pessimistic.

<F P=106> [Report by Gid'on Alon and Tzvi Zrahya] </F>
  [Excerpt] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur has 
disclosed that the Gaza Strip Palestinians have hoarded huge 
quantities of weapons. Replying to three motions to the Knesset 
agenda by Knesset Members Hanan Porat (National Religious 
Party), Efrayim Gur (Likud), and Pini Badash (Tzomet), Gur said 
that since the talks on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip 
were launched, the local residents, motivated by the fear of 
internal strife, have been hoarding large quantities of weapons. 
  Gur said that the security forces have been taking action 
against this trend, attempting to reduce the quantities of 
weapons in the Strip. 
  He admitted that there is apprehension that the large 
quantities of weapons would be also directed against Israelis, 
but noted that the incidence of attacks on the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] involving firearms is not high at this stage.

<F P=106> [Video report by Army affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel] </F>
  [Text] The Israel Air Force's [IAF] future fighter 
aircraft will be the F-15I, produced by the McDonnell Douglas 
Corporation. The first planes will arrive in Israel in a short 
time. 
  Today it is official and final. The agonizing decision has 
been made and the F-15I will be the IAF's next fighter jet. 
Each plane costs approximately $100 million and the Defense 
Ministry's budget permits the purchase of 20 such planes. There 
was a lot of hesitation and qualms by IAF officers. They found 
it hard to choose between 20 F-15's or 50 F-16's at the same 
price. However, the General Staff ultimately opted for the 
F-15. The long range threats facing Israel weighed the decision 
in its favor, and the offices of McDonnell Douglas in Israel and 
abroad are celebrating a huge victory. The United States is not 
only supplying Israel with the most advanced plane of its kind; 
it is no less importantly supplying the accompanying technology 
and this already constitutes a qualitative leap. It will be 
possible to install Israeli systems in this model aircraft and 
it will take time until the IAF can paint its insignia on their 
wings. 
  Former senior IAF officers this evening criticized the 
decision to purchase the F-15I.

  [Text] Major General Herzl Budinger, the Air Force 
commander, disclosed that in the wake of the F-15I deal, the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] and the Air Force in particular are 
postponing the implementation of several plans. For instance, 
the procurement of Black Hawk helicopters is being put off until 
1998. 
  Gen. Budinger told a news conference called to mark the deal 
with McDonnell Douglas Corporation that it would be 
inconceivable for rival Lockheed to cease all purchases in 
Israel immediately. He believes such threats were not made by 
the company's management in the United States but by Elul, which 
represents McDonnell Douglas in Israel. He sharply attacked the 
company representatives, saying that they had conducted a 
personal campaign against him.

<F P=106> [Report by Sha'ul Peretz] </F>
  [Excerpts] A group of 20 senior reserve officers who 
formerly served in elite units and the Shin Bet have been hired 
to train soldiers of the Congo-Brazzaville Army. 
  This is part of a giant arms and military equipment sale, 
worth tens of millions of dollars, by Israel Military Industries 
and other defense manufacturers. An agreement to this effect 
was recently been signed between private Israeli entrepreneurs 
and the Congo Government. In an appendix to the agreement, the 
Israeli company pledged to provide the Congolese Army with 
guidance and training. 
  The "Congo deal" has recently been approved by the Defense 
Ministry's Defense Sales Department. At the same time, the deal 
also met some opposition due to the fact that Congolese loyal to 
the president have been fighting the supporters of the prime 
minister. It is important to note that the deal was made with 
Congo-Brazzaville in West Africa, and not with its neighbor 
Zaire, also known as Congo-Kinshasa. 
  The company behind the deal is Lavdan, a subsidiary of the 
public corporation Qardan Investments [company names as 
published]. The names of the persons who are actually behind 
the deal are not yet known, but the man named in charge of 
executing the training project is Brigadier General Ze'ev 
Zakharin (Reserves), who is considered an expert in training 
foreign armies. 
  Zakharin (45), served as the commander of the liaison unit 
to 
Lebanon and won praise for his work in training the South 
Lebanese Army. [passage omitted] 
  Reacting to the report, the Lavdan company issued the 
following statement: "The deal mentioned includes the supply of 
equipment and guidance which the Israeli companies will provide 
to the African country. Beyond this activity, there is no 
network of persons or elements on behalf of our company in that 
country." 
  The Defense Ministry spokesman reacted: "The Defense 
Ministry is not in the habit of addressing itself to 
publications concerning defense exports."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Making It to Second Grade"] </F>
  [Text] Next Sunday [30 January], the Buffalo Bills 
football team will play against the Dallas Cowboys from Texas to 
try to erase the loser's brand etched on its collective brow 
over the past three years, in which the team repeatedly made it 
to the Super Bowl but tarnished this handsome achievement with 
consecutive defeats. As for Little Rock Bill Clinton, who did 
make it to the finals last year, defeating Texan representative 
George Bush, his true test is still ahead of him -- at the next 
finals in three years. 
  This week Clinton marked the beginning of his second year in 
White House. While he did pass first grade, his graduation to 
second grade is accompanied by the feeling that he has not yet 
fully adjusted to his new school. In his annual State of the 
Union address yesterday, Clinton presented America's current 
priorities: less foreign affairs, less defense, more employment, 
more health insurance, and above all, more action against crime, 
which is destroying the Americans from within. The punch line, 
which got Clinton the most applause, borrowed its terminology 
from another sports arena: baseball. Like a pitcher whose ball 
veers from its destination, a third-time violent offender will 
find himself out or, in this case, inside. 
  Clinton's address touched on the Middle East in passing: The 
Rabin-'Arafat handshake on his lawn was mentioned and received 
in total silence at Congress, where his secretaries, officers, 
and justices were also sitting. Yet Clinton emphasized his 
commitment to the attainment of "comprehensive and durable" 
peace in the region. His intent -- territories for peace -- 
cannot be seriously doubted, although he did not bother to spell 
it out. This does not contradict the departure from tradition 
which Prime Minister Rabin detected this week in the stand of 
President al-Asad, who agrees to a bilateral peace that does not 
depend on the attainment of other agreements. It is a fact that 
King Husayn and Rafiq al-Hariri are waiting for al-Asad, and not 
vice versa, while 'Arafat is the last man in the world al-Asad 
would trust with a veto right over Syria's moves. 
  In his speech, Clinton maintained that there is no 
isolationism in America. This assertion in itself must be 
proven. The Americans have stayed away from involvement in 
Bosnia -- a position which they feel is justified and which the 
President, who dodged the Vietnam draft, can understand. They 
temporarily blundered in Somalia, but were quick to announce a 
date of disengagement and to behead the secretary of defense who 
was -- unjustly -- perceived as responsible for some of the 
casualties in there. All these, as well as the tendency to 
reduce the U.S. naval and ground troops in Europe and Asia, can 
offer no encouragement to Washington's friends. For the time 
being, they can be comforted by the defense aid which refuses to 
die -- $3 billion a year, in Israel's case -- and to wait for 
the future report cards of student Clinton, who lacks the 
qualities that would make him Super Bill in the eyes of 
Americans and foreigners.

  [Text] An Israeli soldier was lightly wounded near 
Ramallah last night when stones were thrown at an Army car. 
  In the Gaza Strip, terrorists opened fire on Israelis in 
three separate incidents. There were no injuries. Two of the 
incidents occurred in Gush Qatif, when terrorists opened fire on 
Israeli cars. The third happened when terrorists shot at an Army 
patrol in Gaza. 
  In Khan Yunus, two homemade explosive devices were thrown at 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and Border Police patrols. There 
were no injuries in that incident either. 
  A resident of the Jabalyah refugee camp was murdered last 
night. He was believed by his attackers to be cooperating with 
Israel. Members of his family brought him to a nearby Army base, 
but efforts to save him failed, and he died of his wounds.

  [Text] The settlers' operation to double the number of 
settlements begins in Qiryat Arba' this evening. Our settlement 
affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that several dozen 
settlers from Judaea and Samaria arrived in Qiryat Arba' and 
started preparations for setting up a new presettlement about 
one km from Qiryat Arba'. Our correspondent reports that the 
settlers set up a special headquarters for this purpose in a 
Qiryat Arba' apartment, and the operation is being conducted to 
all intents and purposes as a military operation. The heads of 
the operation told our correspondent they have not coordinated 
their actions with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], and that if 
they are asked to evacuate the place they will evince passive 
resistance. 
  Reacting to the settlement operation, Minister Binyamin 
Ben-Eli'ezer said Israel is a state of law and whoever breaks 
the law in Qiryat Arba' will be dealt with in the same manner as 
someone breaking the law in Herzliyya. Minister Ben-Eli'ezer 
made these remarks during a tour with the heads of his ministry 
to the 'Etzyon Bloc and Ma'ale Adumim. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1605 GMT on 26 January 
carries a report on Minister Ben-Eli'ezer's tour, in which 
correspondent Gil Litman asks the minister whether the 
government intends to territorially unite Jerusalem with Ma'ale 
Adumim on the east and the 'Etzyon Bloc on the south. Minister 
Ben-Eli'ezer is quoted as saying: "I want to tell you that I do 
not know of any such territorial linkage plan." Later on 
Ben-Eli'ezer adds: "If you ask me whether there is any plan to 
link the 'Etzyon Bloc to Jerusalem, the answer is negative."]

<F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Excerpt] MAPAM's [United Workers Party] 11th convention 
yesterday called for an Israeli recognition of Syria's 
sovereignty over the Golan Heights -- provided that Syria commit 
itself to full peace with Israel, full normalization, meticulous 
security arrangements "conditioned on space and time," and 
arrangements that would secure the water resources essential to 
Israel's existence. 
  In its resolutions, the convention stresses that the Israeli 
recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan should not 
necessarily correspond with physical Israeli presence on the 
Golan, "the extent and duration of which will be determined in 
the negotiations on the peace accord." 
  The convention resolutions regarding Syria further say that 
MAPAM views the formula the prime minister coined -- according 
to which the depth of peace will match the depth of withdrawal 
-- "as a starting point for the formation of the government's 
policy on the issue of the Golan Heights. 
  "Regarding the problem of the Golan Heights, Israel's 
supreme 
interest is the security aspect, that is preventing the Golan 
from turning into a springboard for attacks against Israel in 
general and the Galilee in particular," the resolution says. At 
the same time, MAPAM reiterates its stand that the Golan 
settlements will not be an obstacle on the road to peace. 
  On the Palestinian issue, the MAPAM convention calls on the 
Palestinian leadership "to take into consideration the dynamic 
developments in the region, and to focus on implementing the 
Declaration of Principles on both the interim arrangement and 
the Gaza-Jericho First agreement." 
  The convention calls on the PLO leadership and the Israeli 
Government to make a joint efforts to enhance the negotiations 
and attain the desired agreement. Another resolution states 
that "over the past two decades, MAPAM has maintained that a 
mutual recognition of both nations' right for self determination 
lies at the foundation of peace between them. The readiness to 
accept UN Resolutions 242 and 338, and the willingness to return 
land for peace are a necessary condition for an Israeli peace 
policy. MAPAM has always regarded the autonomy as a temporary 
introduction to the permanent solution that would be founded on 
those principles." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front 
[EPRLF] has declared that it is not going to take part in the 
Eastern Province local elections, which are against the will of 
the people. At the same time, the party also has announced that 
it will not support any group contesting the elections. The 
EPRLF statement also calls for boycotting the elections, which 
are primarily aimed at dividing the North and East and 
prolonging the war. 
  It has also been pointed out that the attempts to hold 
elections in the east in an atmosphere rife with human rights 
violations and military intervention are meant as distraction 
from the ethnic conflict, making the Eastern Province a 
Sinhalese-dominated one, hoodwinking the world with a suggestion 
of the existence of a democratic system there, and encouraging 
the Army. Moreover, we believe that this election is the 
outcome of a decision made with a militaristic view to 
obliterate a national ethnic group rather than a political 
decision of a democratic country.

  [Text] Tamil youths and women are once again being arrested 
indiscriminately in Colombo. M.S. Sellasamy, general secretary 
of the Ceylon Workers Congress and state minister, has appealed 
to President D.B. Wijetunge and A.S. Senaviratne, inspector 
general of the police in Colombo, to take immediate steps to 
stop these arrests. 
  During the harvest festival of Pongal, Tamil people go to 
temples, visit their relatives, and participate in festivals. 
State Minister Sellasamy told VIRAKESARI that he appealed to 
the president to issue orders halting arrests over those days, 
and that the president had accepted the appeal and given 
assurances that he would issue orders to that effect. 
  On Thursday [13 January] alone, 97 people were arrested in 
seven police station areas. The minister said that he asked 
Inspector General of Police Seneviratne to release all of these 
Tamils before the Pongal festival, and that Seneviratne informed 
him that he would take action to release them.

  [Text] Baghdad, 27 Jan (INA) -- The minutes of the 27th 
session of the General Assembly of the Iraqi-Jordanian Overland 
Transport Company were signed here today. The meetings lasted 
two days. 
  The minutes were signed for Iraq by Transport and 
Communications Minister Ahmad Murtada and for Jordan by 
Transport Minister Adib Halasah. 
  At the signing ceremony, Ahmad Murtada stressed Iraq's 
eagerness to promote cooperation with fraternal Jordan, 
especially in transportation. 
  Jordanian Transport Minister Adib Halasah asserted his 
country's eagerness to enhance cooperation with Iraq, especially 
at this stage during which the Iraqi people are suffering as a 
result of an unjust embargo which has no legal foundations 
whatsoever. 
  The minutes approved the company's financial and operational 
report for last year, as well as the transport operations of the 
company's trucks inside the two fraternal countries. 
  The director general of the Iraqi-Jordanian Overland 
Transport Company told INA the minutes also provide for 100 more 
trucks to be added to the fleet traveling between Iraq and 
Jordan, thus raising its total to 520 trucks.

Adib Halasah and his delegation left Baghdad today after taking 
part in the 27th session of the General Assembly of the 
Iraqi-Jordanian Overland Transport Company, which concluded in 
Baghdad yesterday. 
  In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, Adib Halasah said 
the meetings of this session and its positive results have 
emphasized the eagerness of the two sisterly states to increase 
and expand bilateral cooperation, especially in the transport 
field in a manner that secures the flow, and increases the 
capacity of transporting goods and food to the Iraqi people. 
  The Jordanian minister condemned the continued unjust siege 
imposed on the Iraqi people, and described it as unjust and as 
constituting a blatant violation of international and human laws 
and norms.

  [Text] No progress has been made so far in the Cairo 
talks. This came out in remarks the prime minister made this 
afternoon. Rabin said that we should wait for the meeting 
between the drafting teams to end in order to assess the extent 
of their progress before the Peres-'Arafat meeting in Davos. 
Israeli sources report that there are difficulties in the Cairo 
talks, and wide gaps still exist between the stands. The prime 
minister also addressed the statement made yesterday by Jordan's 
King Husayn, saying that the king's willingness to meet him is 
an important move forward, although any impending meeting has 
not yet been discussed. Our political correspondent Udi Segal 
reports: 
  Some good news first: Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin views 
King Husayn's remarks last night as an important development. 
In Jerusalem, satisfaction was expressed regarding the king's 
remarks, although they too are taken with a pinch of salt, just 
as every utterance the king makes. Jerusalem sources believe 
that Husayn's remarks contain the following message: I may be 
linked with Syria and al-Asad, but I am no protege of the Syrian 
president. I am the leader of an independent state. 
  Rabin was satisfied with the Jordanian king's remarks, 
although he does not foresee a meeting in the next few days; a 
few weeks perhaps. A few minutes ago, we asked him: 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Segal] Have you started 
packing for your trip to Amman? 
  [Rabin] I read King Husayn's statement carefully. If indeed 
he is showing willingness to hold a meeting, I will only be too 
happy. Currently, I know nothing about timetables, nor do I 
know what is required before the meeting. In his statement, he 
said that certain preparation is required before the meeting 
takes place. We are willing to make the preparations. As a 
rule, however, the very statement about his willingness to hold 
a meeting with me in public constitutes an important move 
forward. [end recording] 
  Regarding the Palestinian track, no progress has yet been 
made in the Cairo deliberations between the Israeli and the 
Palestinian teams drafting the working papers. The differences 
in principle are still those regarding Israel's demand to have 
suspects inspected at the crossings in what has been called a 
sterile room, a small room, or an isolated cell. Israel agrees 
not to have the suspects inspected by an Israeli representative 
there, but with electronic devices. It demands, however, that 
the inspection of the suspects be held in a separate room. 
Prime Minister Rabin also did not have anything new and 
encouraging to report: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] At this time, I cannot say for 
certain that the differences or stands have been bridged. We 
will hear a report about what went on in Cairo. We will meet 
this evening, and we will see. [end recording] 
  At the same time, some Jerusalem sources have said that even 
if no progress is made, and even if the security issues are not 
fully finalized in Cairo, progress must be made in Davos -- at 
least from the Palestinian point of view. The negotiations 
there will be held with 'Arafat, which simply means that 
anything can happen.

  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said Pakistan is firmly committed toward establishing an 
equitable and nondiscriminatory nonproliferation regime in South 
Asia. Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the National 
Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering in 
Faisalabad today, he said Pakistan's nuclear program is purely 
peaceful and we have no intention to develop a nuclear weapon. 
The president said we will welcome and cooperate on any 
proposal from any quarter to make South Asia a nuclear-free 
zone. However, Pakistan will not accept unilateral restrictions 
on its peaceful nuclear program on the pretext of 
nonproliferation. 
  Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said Pakistan has acquired 
political stability after a long time. The government is now 
concentrating on promoting industrial infrastructure by 
advancing science and technology in the country.

  [Text] Batticaloa -- At a press conference held in the 
party office in Batticaloa, E. Durairatnam, Central Committee 
member of the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front 
[EPRLF] said: In today's context, the Tamils want a political 
solution and not elections. After a ten-year conflict, if an 
election is the answer for the Tamils and if we accept it, it 
will weaken us. 
  Former provincial council members N. Nesarasa and K. 
Parameswaramoorthy were also present at the news conference. 
Durairatnam further said: This election is the first step to 
dividing the Northeastern Province. By holding a separate 
election for the Eastern Province after a referendum there, the 
government is now working with the aim of smashing the 
traditional (?fort) and motherland of the Tamils as well as 
dividing and destroying their region through a planned Sinhalese 
settlement. Several irregularities have taken place in fielding 
the candidates. By force, the Army has fielded candidates 
against their will. Is it possible to hold free and fair 
elections under these circumstances? One can guess the 
government's planned move to bolster its views in an atmosphere 
of strife by adopting fraudulent methods in the elections. Why 
do certain groups who say that they contest the elections only 
to defeat the United National Party not condemn the outrageous 
acts in fielding the candidates and keep quiet? It is doubtful 
whether the local bodies will be able to function independently 
in today's atmosphere today, where it is not possible to run the 
civil administration even amid military intervention. We should 
not forget the legitimate demands of the Tamil people by 
involving ourselves in the election process and should give up 
our struggle for power only. All the organizations should unite 
together and fight for a political solution. The experiences we 
gained by our participation in the northeastern provincial 
elections tell us that the Tamils are not going to reap any 
immediate benefits from the local body elections. At the same 
time, we will fight for boycotting the elections in a democratic 
way. We will not hesitate to strongly condemn anybody who works 
for or against the elections at gunpoint.

  [Text] Pakistan has categorically rejected the allegations 
made by the Indian home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, of the 
involvement of ISI [Inter-Service Intelligence] in the 
insurgencies taking place in northeastern India. A Foreign 
Office spokesman said in Islamabad that one purpose of this 
smear campaign by India against Pakistan is to mask Indian 
repression and atrocities in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. He 
said the (?vehemence) and frequency of Indian allegations 
against Pakistan are proportionate to the degree of its internal 
difficulties.

  [Text] Islamabad -- The government Sunday [23 Jan] took a 
very serious view and made it clear to all Arab nationals 
involved in the Afghan Jihad, presently living inside Pakistan, 
that they must leave the country by January 31, or face 
extradition. 
  Replying a point of order regarding a statement of the 
Egyptian diplomat about the presence of some of the Egyptian 
nationals in Pakistan in the National Assembly Sunday evening, 
Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar said, "the government has 
taken a final decision that all such people whether they belong 
to Egypt, Algeria or any other country would be extradited." He 
told the House that Pakistan would not allow anybody to use its 
soil for terrorist activities. The minister said that they 
(Arab nationals) can go anywhere they want after being expelled 
from Pakistan. 
  "We will not allow Pakistan to be used as a stick. We will 
certainly not allow Egypt to let their nationals stay here and 
then label us as terrorists. We will not allow this." 
  The attention of the govt was drawn by PKMAP's [Pukhtun Khwa 
Milli Awami Party] Mahmood Khan Achakzai who while speaking on a 
point of order, referred to an interview given by Mustafa 
Hanafi, Ambassador of Egypt. Achkzai informed the House that 
the Ambassador had disclosed that twenty Egyptians including ten 
murderers were residing in Pakistan. One of these, he said was, 
living inside Islamabad. 
  Interior Minister added that the government was in touch 
with 
the Embassy of Egypt in this regard. He said the Egyptian 
diplomats were apprehensive about their (Arab Nationals) return 
as they would be a nuisance to the Egyptian govt. "But we have 
told them clearly that they had to leave Pakistan by January 31 
along with all other Arabs would be allowed to go back to 
Afghanistan if they so desired. 
  Maulana Faziur Rehman pleaded with the government that they 
should, instead, give assurances to the countries of these Arabs 
and NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] that Pakistan would 
control these people. He pleaded that they should not be 
returned to their respective countries for possible execution 
there. He added that these Arabs who were now being labelled as 
murderers were those that had come to Pakistan for the Afghan 
Jihad. 
  In the past, this very issue had been raised by the media at 
the Foreign Office. They were told that there had been no such 
complaints from the Egyptian Embassy here. However, the 
caretaker government had also taken up the issue and put 
restrictions on all Arab Non Governmental Organisations housed 
in Peshawar. The caretaker government had also ordered them to 
leave the country. 
  Meanwhile, as thousands of Afghans gathered at the Torkham 
border to enter Pakistan, the interior minister reiterated 
Pakistan's position on the issue. 
  He said Pakistan would keep its border with Afghanistan 
closed as there were several peaceful areas inside Afghanistan 
where the people of Kabul could take refuge. He once again 
reminded the House that the jihad was over. Turning to the 
continued news bulletins from the BBC which spoke about the 
plight of the refugees, the minister replied, "Jalalabad airport 
is open. Flights can operate to take these refugees to the 
United Kingdom if they so desire."

  [Text] Islamabad -- The government on Wednesday [26 
January] expressed disappointment over the contents of six 
nonpapers which New Delhi handed over on Tuesday because none of 
them addressed the core and fundamental problem of Occupied 
Kashmir. 
  However, the Foreign Office says it will study them very 
carefully with the seriousness they deserve. Other ministries 
would also study them and only then would a `considered 
reaction' be given. 
  Giving his preliminary reaction Foreign Secretary Shaharyar 
M 
Khan said; "None of the six non-papers really goes into the 
depth of the issue. We feel that India's position is mainly to 
raise less important issues to show to the world that we are 
engaged in negotiations so that pressure by Western countries, 
governments and public opinion is diverted." 
  The Foreign Secretary said that unlike New Delhi, Pakistan, 
in its two non-papers, referred to the two crucial issues, i.e, 
steps for stopping repression in occupied Kashmir and modalities 
of holding plebiscite. 
  Giving his reactions on the six-non papers one by one 
Shaharyar M Khan expressed his amazement that proposal on Line 
of Control (LoC) virtually calls for the acceptance of the 
status quo on the LoC. "This is not acceptable to Pakistan. 
This does not refer to the question of repression (on the LoC) 
which is why there is tension there." 
  The Foreign Secretary felt that if this issue was addressed 
as if there was no tension at the LoC, then one would have only 
a `mechanical agreement' thus missing the point altogether. 
  He felt that the three non-papers on Siachen, Wullar Barrage 
and Sir Creek show that the points on which discussions were 
left off during the last talks, have not been accurately 
reflected. 
  These technical issues, he said, had shown progress in the 
past but the non-papers on the subject do not show this. 
  India's non-paper on confidence-building measures has also 
greatly disappointed Pakistan which feels that these continue to 
be `peripheral issues' while the core issue is completely 
by-passed. 
  Commenting on the `no first strike' policy, the Foreign 
Secretary said that since Pakistan was not a nuclear power and 
since it did not possess any nuclear weapon "this was a 
contradiction". 
  This proposal, he added, asks for something that Pakistan 
does not possess. 
  In the same area, about increasing the frequency of the two 
DMOs' [expansion unknown] talk to each other, Mr Khan replied: 
"I was expecting reference to regional non-proliferation, or 
the banning of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles." 
  There is agreement on the proposal of joint commissions but 
the Foreign Secretary added: "It is important to discuss 
repression in Occupied Kashmir, and the human rights issue. 
These come first. Things like exchanging table tennis teams 
and military bands can come later. They are not our top 
priority."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nonsense Non-Papers"] </F>
  [Text] Trivialising the issue is what the Indian government 
seems to be interested in right now. When the secretary level 
talks on Kashmir started in Islamabad at the start of the new 
year, no one expected a breakthrough but it was generally hopes 
that the meeting will at least lead to a marked decrease in 
human rights violations and repression of the Indian armed 
forces against the Kashmir people living under Indian 
occupation. Instead, the Indian army has intensified atrocities 
and the ferocity and the frequency of "sieze, search and 
destroy" operations in the predominantly Muslim areas has 
increased manifold. When a delegation of the Amnesty 
International was in New Delhi last week, it was denied 
permission to visit these areas which continue to be under 
perpetual siege by the Indian army who do not allow even 
essential supplies into these areas as a collective punishment 
for the entire population. The method adopted by the Indian 
army in occupied Kashmir is more brutal and inhuman then even in 
Bosnia where at least there are some safe heavens. [as 
published] In occupied Kashmir there are no safe heavens even 
for women, children and the aged. The Indian army has divided 
the whole [word indistinct] of population in the valley into 
fully guarded prisoner camps and totally isolated them from the 
outside world. This is what the Indian leaders call "the Punjab 
way" of solving the Kashmir problem. This only confirms 
Pakistan's suspicion that India's readiness to discuss Kashmir 
was nothing but a diversionary move to gain time and befool the 
world public opinion. If any fresh proof was needed to confirm 
these suspicions, the Indian foreign secretary provided it when 
he handed out six non-papers to Pakistan High Commissioner in 
New Delhi the other day. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar was trying 
to be polite when he described these non-papers as 
"disappointing." 
  From what has become known about these non-papers, it is 
clear that India has made a deliberate effort to miss the point 
by dodging and ducking the real issue. First, India dragged its 
feet as usual and delayed delivering on the promise of providing 
informal position papers within a fortnight. After Pakistan 
expressed its indignation over the delay, the Indians handed 
over the "non-papers" which mostly focus on non-issues or simply 
repeat India's previous position on technical matters involved. 
In some matters like Siachen, Sir Creek, Wuller Barrage, etc, 
the Indian non-papers do not pick up the thread from where it 
was left in the latest talks early this month. Instead, the 
position stated goes back to what was known even before the last 
secretary level talks. The non-papers do not reflect whatever 
little progress was possible in the last round. That can only 
mean that the Indians either do not want the next round of talks 
to start sooner or want to introduce as many non-issues as 
possible and stretch the talks to provide, their armed forces 
with enough time to choke and strangulate the whole population 
which continues under their brutal siege. 
  On its part, Pakistan provided India with two non-papers it 
had promised and suggested specific steps to improve the 
situation in occupied Kashmir, Pakistan had also made it clear 
that the next round of talks should focus on discussing the 
modalities for holding a plebiscite in Kashmir. The Indians, in 
their non-papers not only have avoided the substantive issue of 
Kashmir but have also made a mockery of the whole exercise by 
raising a wholly non-existent issue, i.e. "no first strike" 
using nuclear weapons. While India may have nuclear warheads, 
as many believe it has, Pakistan has no such weapons and hence 
no question of first strike capability of Pakistan can be 
relevent. This only shows the utter nonseriousness of the 
Indian leaders in solving a problem which continues to be a 
flashpoint in this sensitive region. As for our US friends, who 
have been trying to facilitate a dialogue with India on Kashmir, 
we would only say that the most important ingredient of a 
peaceful solution continues to be missing and that is political 
commitment of the Indian government to resolve the dispute. 
Should we continue to hope that the Americans will ultimately 
notice this glaring absence and try to convince their Indian 
friends that it is time to abandon pretensions and attend to 
solving the core issue in earnest.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Six Indian Proposals Rejected"] </F>
  [Text] Indian High Commissioner S.K. Lamba met the 
Pakistani foreign secretary the other day and presented six 
proposals to lessen the existing tension between Pakistan and 
India. The proposals were related to matters like Siachen 
glacier, the Line of Control [LOC] in Kashmir, Sir Creek, 
delimitation of the maritime boundary, reactivation of the camps 
formed by the joint commission in 1988, and steps to create a 
parity [between the two countries] in the peaceful nuclear 
program. The Pakistani authorities have not yet examined the 
proposals in detail. However, expressing an initial reaction, 
the Foreign Office has said there is nothing in the Indian 
proposals which can boost Pakistan's hope for a solution of the 
issues, adding that these are nonpapers. Diplomatic sources say 
that indications are that India will consider reducing its 
forces along the LOC if Pakistan agrees to these proposals and 
starts implementing them. It will, in fact, not solve any 
problem. 
  It had been India's fashion from the very beginning to 
emphasize talks on secondary subjects instead of the main 
issues. But if the primary and basic issues are resolved, then 
it will automatically lead to the resolution of secondary issues 
as well. The whole world knows that the main dispute between 
Pakistan and India is the sole issue of Kashmir. But India 
persistently avoids any concrete and positive talks to resolve 
it. The first time Kashmir was acknowledged as an issue was at 
the recent foreign secretary-level talks between the two 
countries in Islamabad. However, no progress toward a solution 
of the issue could be made due to India's arrogance. And now, 
in the current proposals, India totally omitted the Kashmir 
issue. Since the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, declared 
that only purposeful talks will be held with India, holding 
talks on secondary issues instead of the real ones will only be 
a waste of time. Hence, the rejection of the proposals is a 
correct decision.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Condition for Future Pakistan-India Talks"] </F>
  [Text] Pakistan has proposed to India that the next round 
of bilateral talks should be held to fix the modalities for 
holding a plebiscite in occupied Kashmir. Besides, India should 
take definite steps in occupied Kashmir to create a conducive 
atmosphere for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute. 
Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan summoned Indian High 
Commissioner S.K. Lambha to the Foreign Office and handed to him 
the Pakistani proposals, which are aimed at focussing attention 
on the vital issues concerning the Kashmir dispute and giving 
the talks a meaningful and purposeful direction. Pakistan has 
asked India to give a response to these proposals and said that 
only after receiving its reply can arrangements be made for the 
next round of bilateral talks on the peaceful resolution of the 
dispute. If India stops its atrocities in occupied Kashmir and 
gives its consent to providing an opportunity to the people for 
an impartial plebiscite on the future of Kashmir, talks could be 
resumed by the end of the year. According to the BBC, Foreign 
Secretary Shaharyar Khan did not describe these proposals as a 
condition for the talks. But, if India totally rejects them, it 
will be proved that India does not want to remove the 
differences. On finding out the views of the Kashmiri people, 
India had said there might be some consensus on certain issues. 
According to BBC, the political intricacies between the two 
countries are quite delicate. But, even this small step [of 
holding plebiscite in Kashmir] will also be in the right 
direction. The peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue depends 
upon the referendum of the Kashmiri people. If India comes 
forward to fix modalities for this referendum and, along with 
it, halt the atrocities in occupied Kashmir as a mark of 
goodwill, it might create an atmosphere for the resumption of 
meaningful talks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed feature: "Leaders of the CIS Countries Answer </F>
IZVESTIYA's Question"] 
  [Text] On the eve of the New Year, IZVESTIYA put a single 
question to the heads of the CIS countries: 
  Which was the happiest day for you in the outgoing year, and 
which was the most difficult? 
<H5>  Boris Yeltsin, President of Russia </H5>
  Your question goes straight to the point. I will not forget 
1993. You can guess why. 
  3-4 October, the storming of the White House... I admit that 
for me this decision was not only forced on me, it was the most 
agonizing and difficult decision. On that tragic night, hour 
after hour I watched real signs of civil war developing in 
Russia, with consequences far in excess of the Russian people's 
national tragedy at the beginning of the century. The decision 
had to be made quickly. I took that step for the sake of a 
single goal -- to avoid war within the country. I am not likely 
to forget all I felt during those days and hours. 
  Now, for an emotionally positive event in the past year. It 
was, of course, the adoption of the new Constitution. 
  My compatriots, the people of Russia, once again 
demonstrated 
the people's wisdom. That event, that day, can, for me, be seen 
as the goal of my political career. I was working toward it for 
three years, and I am happy that Russia has at last acquired an 
intelligent, worthy Constitution. 
<H5>  Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Kazakhstan </H5>
  Almaty -- This year was extremely tense both for Kazakhstan 
and for the Commonwealth, and probably for the entire world 
community. Amid the kaleidoscope of complex and dramatic events 
of this year, it is not easy to identify the most important. 
  Fratricidal conflicts in various regions of the Commonwealth 
brought pain and suffering. But in the main we were able to 
prevent them from developing into global interstate clashes. 
Wisdom and farsightedness doubtless lie not in driving conflicts 
underground, but averting them by political means. 
  In our countries there is a growing awareness of the 
futility 
of confrontation between peoples. And nobody but ourselves can 
stop that confrontation. 
  The most important thing that should exist in relations 
among 
our countries is equality, friendship, and consideration for 
mutual interests. That will undoubtedly help us to reach a new 
level of integration. I hope the language of cooperation and 
mutual understanding will become the basis of our partnership. 
  Let me take this opportunity to congratulate IZVESTIYA's 
collective and all its readers on the new year, 1994, and to 
express the wish that everyone may have as many peaceful and 
joyous days as possible. I would wish us to cherish our main 
asset -- good-neighborliness and the indissoluble bonds of 
friendship. 
<H5>  Leonid Kravchuk, President of Ukraine </H5>
  Kiev -- I realize these are metaphorical questions: It is 
not easy to single out one or two days from the whole torrent of 
days. Let me say, I am pleased when some question that is 
important to Ukraine is resolved, when a step is taken toward 
boosting our prestige in the international arena or when, say, 
we have been able to reach agreement with our neighbors or 
within the state on some economic, political, or diplomatic 
question. Or when a sick grandson or granddaughter gets better 
-- then I am happy. And I am pleased when people smile at our 
meetings -- I know how hard things are for them, they think it 
is partly my fault, and that is true, but it is a sign that they 
believe in Ukraine's future. 
  The most important, crucial act this year, from the 
viewpoint of the state's future, was parliament's adoption of 
the decision on early elections. I am convinced that the 
present parliament, whatever you may think of it, is not capable 
of doing more than it has done. And that is not simply the 
deputies' fault -- the parliament was elected in a different 
time, it bears the stamp of that time, and it is not 
professional. Therefore I was pleased that it was not necessary 
to use any strong-arm measures to persuade the deputies of what 
they ought to do. 
  As for major unpleasantnesses, I have had two this year. 
  The first was the miners' summer strike. I saw disaster was 
not far off. After that, there was the meeting with the Russian 
delegation in Massandra. Russia then saw how hard the strikes 
were hitting Ukraine, and it was brought to its knees by 
internal problems. On top of that there was external pressure, 
and people were taking advantage of our weakness. 
  And the second difficult day, and difficult night, for me -- 
3 October in Moscow. I knew that if the Khasbulatov and Rutskoy 
crew was victorious in the White House, similar processes would 
begin, as usual, in Ukraine. That evening I had information 
that in some regions people were already preparing practical 
steps to overthrow the presidential structures and restore 
Soviet power under the slogan: "All power to the soviets." It 
could have meant extremely difficult times, even bloodshed. I 
cannot ever remember feeling such agitation in recent years or 
having such an outlook. 
<H3>  Stanislav Shushkevich, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of 
Belarus </H3>
  Minsk -- I cannot distinguish one day from another in the 
past year, and therefore I cannot name the most difficult. 
There was a lot of work on the Supreme Soviet -- intensive 
work, highly necessary to the republic and the people. 
Unfortunately, it was necessary to "chase" certain dishonest 
people. They sometimes raised problems of what I would call 
back-street significance. All this diverted attention and cost 
time and effort. The behavior and actions of certain leaders, 
even some of very high rank, who say they care about the people 
is annoying. 
  The most gratifying days in the past year were when the 
Belarus Supreme Soviet adopted the laws on public privatization. 
The republic government's task is to fulfill these laws, so 
that instead of a handful of millionaires getting rich, the 
entire people have something, to make life a little bit easier 
for them. The fate of the Belarusian people is all too hard, 
they have borne too much in their history, and things are very 
difficult for them at present. They have a right to a better 
life. 
  I would like to take this opportunity sincerely to 
congratulate all IZVESTIYA's readers on the coming New Year and 
to wish them good health, happiness, prosperity, and calm. 
<H5>  Mircea Snegur, President of Moldova </H5>
  Chisinau -- It is perhaps better to speak about features 
rather than days, because I almost never have a day that is 
absolutely happy. So, now for what is sad, or rather vexatious. 
I am talking about the Tiraspol leaders' incredible lack of 
understanding of the changed situation. Despite the efforts and 
initiative of the republic leadership, we have not succeeded in 
moving toward the elimination of the consequences of the 
conflict. God and the people will be their judge. 
  Now for what is happy. We have had a year of peace. 
Privatization has begun. We have introduced a national 
currency. Certain other steps were also taken along the path of 
consolidating the republic and its statehood and independence. 
  At the personal level, for me, of course, the big event was 
my grandson's first birthday. 
  Happy New Year to all IZVESTIYA's readers! 
<H5>  Islam Karimov, President of Uzbekistan </H5>
  Tashkent -- I cannot name a specific day: Every day in the 
past year was both difficult and happy in its way. 
  There are many people who do not like peace and accord, 
political stability in the republic, and the consistent, phased 
implementation of economic reforms. To be frank, our opponents 
cannot tolerate two factors which determine our true wealth: 
One is the interethnic and civic accord, the cohesion of all 
the inhabitants of Uzbekistan, and the other is Uzbekistan's 
gold, our high-carat gold, which is becoming famous throughout 
the world and is winning prestige in the international market. 
  Incidentally, as of today, Uzbek gold worth $500 million is 
invested in West European banks as a guarantee. We intend to 
bring the account up to $1 billion, in order to widen the influx 
of foreign investments into Uzbekistan's economy. 
  Imamali Rakhmonov, Chairman of the Tajikistan Supreme 
Council 
  It is hard to single out my happiest day in the past year. 
But nonetheless, I think the January days were the happiest. 
In that period, in a short space of time, Dushanbe, which was 
devoid of people, came to life following the advent of 
constitutional power. I was happy to see smiles appearing on the 
citizens' faces. People straightened their shoulders -- the 
fear had gone, and real hope had sprung up for the establishment 
of peace, stabilization, and the attainment of national accord. 
That was when I was happy, in purely human terms. 
  The most difficult time for me, as for all the people and 
the 
republic as a whole, was, unfortunately, the whole of 1993. It 
was the most difficult year in my entire life. During this 
period very many socioeconomic difficulties and problems have 
arisen, which we have worked and are now working to resolve. 
  I hope 1994 will be the year of the normalization of the 
highly complex situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, a year of 
mutual understanding and accord between forces of different 
political orientations in our country, for the sake of achieving 
peace and security not only in Tajikistan, but throughout the 
Central Asian region. 
<H5>  Saparmurad Niyazov, President of Turkmenistan </H5>
  Ashgabat -- I will not try to isolate the single most 
difficult day; there were many such days. But I associate the 
happy day with that sunny day in December when Turkmenistan and 
Russia found one another in a new capacity. The appearance on 
the eve of the session of CIS heads of state of the agreement on 
the settlement of dual citizenship questions, the process of 
resettlement, and the defense of the rights of migrants, and 
also the treaty on the joint security of the Turkmenistan's 
border, in many ways determined the success of the summit 
meeting in Ashgabat also. I confess, the decision connected 
with these documents was arrived at with difficulty. Both 
sides' groups of experts worked long and painstakingly on the 
agreements. We were perfectly aware what role these documents 
are designed to play in establishing democratic ideals and 
defending the individual's right to choose. I was happy that we 
reached agreement... 
<H5>  Askar Akayev, President of Kyrgyzstan </H5>
  Bishkek -- The happiest day was 5 May 1993, when 
Kyrgyzstan's Constitution was adopted, opening the way for the 
progressive development of the republic, for the construction of 
a democratic state, and the formation of a civil, rule-of-law 
society. I am convinced that not only members of the 
constitutional commission who formulated this Constitution, and 
not only the deputies who adopted it, will be proud of it, but 
also the future generations of Kyrgyzstan. 
  The most difficult day was 20 December, when a crisis of 
state power arose at a session of the republic Supreme Council, 
and the opposition of the two branches -- the legislative and 
the executive -- reached its very apogee. 
  The difficult and only possible solution in this situation 
was a decision by the whole government to resign. I am glad 
that this difficult step, this difficult day, and this difficult 
decision enabled us to resolve several problems at once. This 
made it possible for us to avoid conflict or confrontation both 
in parliament itself and within the republic. After this 
decision, everyone felt some kind of relief, and I am glad that 
we found the path of harmony and consensus in forming the new 
government. This new government can be called a coalition 
government. 
<H5>  Geydar Aliyev, President of the Azerbaijan Republic </H5>
  Baku -- It is hard for me to speak about a happy day. 
Indeed, how is it ossible to be happy, when Azerbaijan is being 
subjected to aggression, when 20 percent of its territory is 
occupied, and the republic has 1.2 million hungry refugees? 
There can be no happy day, happy hour, or happy moment for any 
president in the world in a similar situation, I am convinced. 
This, I am convinced, is out of the question. 
  As for a complex or, as you remarked, difficult day, perhaps 
it was the day I assumed the heavy responsibility for the fate 
of the Azerbaijani state and its people. 
<H5>  Levon Ter-Petrosyan, President of Armenia </H5>
  Yerevan -- The happiest day for me will be the day peace is 
restored in Nagorno-Karabakh. Until that day, all days have 
been and will be difficult.

  [Text] The December meeting of CIS heads of state and 
defense ministers in Ashgabat was one of the most important 
events of this year. As early as six months ago, General 
Ivashov, secretary of the CIS Council of Defense Ministers, 
spoke about the imminent integration of the commonwealth Armed 
Forces. Vyacheslav Morozov, correspondent of the Radar studio, 
talked to him. 
  [Begin recording] [Morozov] Leonid Grigoryevich, has the 
idea 
of setting up CIS Armed Forces already been dropped or is it 
still alive? 
  [Ivashov] I believe that nobody has dropped this idea. It 
has simply been postponed in connection with quite complex 
processes related to the formation of national armed forces, 
which are compounded by economic and financial difficulties as 
well as other difficulties which our society, our Commonwealth, 
is going through. Therefore, the idea has not been discarded, 
but it has simply been decided to move toward it stage by stage. 
And the things that took place in Ashgabat, at the joint 
meeting of the Council of Defense Ministers, the Council of 
Foreign Ministers, and the meeting of the Council of Heads of 
State show precisely that we are entering a new phase of our 
military cooperation. Quite specific decisions were adopted 
there. First, a headquarters to coordinate military cooperation 
was set up, its statute was approved, and the principles of its 
financing and the functions of the headquarters were defined. 
  I would note as a second point the fact that more than 18 
months after the Tashkent collective security treaty was signed 
specific steps were taken to implement its provisions. A 
secretary general was appointed, a decision on priority steps to 
implement the treaty was adopted, and a mechanism was determined 
for other states to join the treaty. Georgia and Azerbaijan, 
for instance, have already joined the collective security 
treaty. Nine Commonwealth states now support the idea of the 
treaty, and they are starting to work on creating a collective 
security system. 
  Army General Vitaliy Grigoryevich Radetskiy, Ukrainian 
defense minister, made a heartening statement in the spirit of a 
constructive approach to the collective security system and 
military cooperation within the Commonwealth framework in 
general. So the idea is not only alive but has already been 
filled with specific content. 
  We are now in a period of transition to military integration 
and construction. An earlier stage was aimed at more or less 
civilized division of the Armed Forces, at our divorce, as it 
were, in the post-Soviet period. But now a creative stage is 
beginning, and I hope I am not mistaken on this matter. We will 
draw closer, step by step, restore a single defense space, and 
create a defense and security system by joint efforts. [end

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature; by Andrey </F>
Pershin, Andrey Petrovskiy, Vladimir Shishlin, edited by Boris 
Grishchenko] 
  [Text] According to the chief of staff for coordinating CIS 
military cooperation, Colonel-General Viktor Samsonov, the CIS 
countries will create in the future collective armed forces. 
Samsonov considers as their prototype the peacekeepers in 
Tajikistan, which include armed units from Russia, Uzbekistan 
and Kyrgyzstan. 
  Addressing in Moscow a news conference, Samsonov said that 
the CIS countries see for themselves that no one state can 
ensure military security independently. Samsonov drew the 
attention to the fact that at the CIS summit in Ashgabat, 
Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Belarus joined the treaty on collective 
security which was earlier signed by six CIS countries. 
  Samsonov praised Ukraine's growing interest to problems of 
collective security. Though the country did not sign the 
documents, it said it was going to consider its possible 
involvement in the collective security system. 
  Samsonov has called as one of the main results of the CIS 
Defense Ministers' Council meeting in Ashgabat the annulment of 
the chief command of the CIS Armed Forces and the creation of 
the staff for coordinating CIS military cooperation. Samsonov 
said that among the staff's tasks is the coordination of the CIS 
Defense Ministries' efforts for organizing and developing of the 
CIS armed forces, coordination of efforts to organize a system 
of air defense, as well as problems associated with the border 
guard of the Tajik-Afghan border.

  [Text] Moscow December 31 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's leading 
newspapers examine the results of the outgoing year and try to 
forecast what the coming year will bring to the country and its 
people. 
  The ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA newspaper features an interview with 
Sergey Volkov, D. Sc. (History), who says the following: "As for 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), it is highly 
improbable that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy (LDPR leader) will quarrel 
with the president if Boris Yeltsin treats respectfully his 
party. 
  "He has always sided with Yeltsin at the most fateful 
moments: The dissolution of the old parliament and the approval 
of the new constitution... Yeltsin benefited most of all by the 
elections. Some people wanted to dump him and start the struggle 
for the presidential office, but it has become clear now that 
the country cannot do without him. He is the only mainstay." 
  In the scholar's opinion, "Zhirinovskiy will never be a 
president, and the LDPR will never collect more than 30-40 per 
cent of votes, as communists will never return to power 
peacefully under their own name." 
  "People increasingly evaluate politicians by their deeds 
rather than by their words," the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper 
notes. "The LDPR's success at the general elections is only the 
first stage of this party's downfall, as well as the downfall of 
many other politicians determining the fate of our country now. 
  "Russia," the newspaper continues, "is a country of 
revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. We have been 
living in the conditions of the struggle between these two 
parties for 150 years. The composition of these parties 
constantly changes, and they come to power in turns. They 
grappled in a bloody fight in Moscow's centre in 1993. 
  "Neither side was wise enough and responsible to stop and 
even to retreat in order to prevent the country from going down 
the drain. Regrettably, the fight has not ended yet. Victors 
understand that they are not put in the dock. But they do not 
understand another thing: The camp of victors immediately 
divides into two factions of enemy friends. Russia has already 
experienced all this in the 20th century." 
  The same newspaper carries an article by Aleksey Arbatov, 
D.Sc. (History), saying the following: "The grim truth is that 
the previous stage of reforms failed. Cosmetic patching-up and 
personnel reshuffling will not improve the present situation. 
  "We should not `continue the course of reforms' but should 
radically review both ways of drafting the policy and the policy 
itself. 
  "Only a law-governed state can carry out democratic reforms 
in the economy and policy. Not a single question of democratic 
construction can be settled by force. It only aggravates 
problems and yields diametrically opposite results." 
  The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper runs an interview with 
Former 
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. "I cannot approve reforms, 
especially when they are connected with a change of an economic 
management system and the entire system and when authorities do 
not keep the ailments of reforms under control," he says. 
  "Policy disregarding people's interests is immoral. I'm also 
worried over a reverse movement from gained freedoms: from 
openness and democratic institutions which started functioning. 
  "If anybody thinks that it is possible to gain stability and 
order by discarding democracy, he makes a great mistake. If we 
are to speak about firm order, it has been always based on the 
efficient operation of all arms of government and firm 
implementation of laws rather than on arbitrary rule," Gorbachev 
stresses. 
  "I believe that Russia can restore its economic, political, 
constitutional, legal and spiritual wealth," former chairman of 
the Russian Constitutional Court writes in the PRAVDA newspaper. 
  "All of us should think over where we go, whom we elect and 
whom we obey. We should overcome legal nihilism. We should 
think abot responsibility, above all, of statesmen and 
officials." 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper prints an interview with 
Metropolitan Gedeon who says: "As a believer I claim: Russia is 
the home of Holy Virgin. The mother of Jesus Christ cares for 
our homeland. But we turned away from her. `Freedom' was 
granted to us. 
  "Well, we partook of this freedom -- immorality, crime, drug 
addiction and such shame when our Russian girls go to sell 
themselves to underdeveloped countries for a piece of bread or 
pie. Russia weeps with bloody tears and prays for stopping this 
disgrace of lawlessness. Merciful Holy Virgin makes such 
miracles and omens that we shall regain our consciousness 
earlier or later and shall come to our senses." 
  The TRUD newspaper carries an article by chairman of the 
Interdepartmental Commission of the Russian Security Council on 
ecological security, dealing with the demographic situation in 
Russia. 
  "According to the latest forecasts," he writes, "some 
stabilisation of birth-rate is expected in the country, mostly 
thanks to an increase in women of child-bearing age. 
  "The demographic situation in Russia as a whole, that is the 
future of the nation, largely depends on whether the average 
family will withstand this difficult time. 
  "If to speak honestly about the tragic statistics, the 
conclusion is quite definite: Russia is ill, and the state of 
its population's health already threatens the security of the 
country." 
  Major-General Gennadiy Zaytsev, head of the Alfa group of 
the 
chief security department, describes the struggle against 
terrorists in the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper. 
  "Guided by an analysis of the present situation, we can draw 
the conclusion that it is highly improbable that the level of 
terrorism will drop in the near future. On the contrary, we may 
encouter even its more audacious manifestations. 
  "To prevent them, it is necessary to create a streamlined 
system of terrorism control at the state level. Besides, this 
work should be directed from a single centre. In that case, 
cooperation of various organisations participating in such 
measures could be more close and fruitful," Zaytsev stressed.

  [Text] The Belarusian parliament's presidium has turned 
down UN Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali's request for sending a 
Belarusian battalion to Yugoslavia for a peace-keeping mission, 
speaker of the Belarusian parliament Stanislav Shushkevich told 
Interfax's Minsk branch. 
  He said that although Belarus was well aware of the 
importance of its participation in the international effort to 
settle armed conflicts, the presidium did not even venture to 
raise this question in the parliament. The Belarusian people 
have not yet got over the Afghan syndrome, he said. He also 
added that during the Afghan war Belarus had lost far more 
soldiers than other former Soviet republics. 
  Shushkevich said that the current psychological condition of 
Belarusian society and the memories of World War II during which 
Belarus lost one fourth of its population was another reason for 
refusal. 
  He stated that other representatives of the UN 
secretary-general had also been informed of the presidium's 
unanimous position. 
  See the upcoming issue of the Presidential Bulletin for 
Shushkevich's exclusive interview with Interfax.
