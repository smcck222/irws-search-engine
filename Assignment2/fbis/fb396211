  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1100 GMT on 4 January broadcasts a report from the 
"Vesti" newscast by correspondent T. Orlova over video of 
printing and typesetting operations, on the newspaper printing 
workers' reaction to the government resolution of 25 November 
1993, which forced up costs for printing and publishing 
services. Many publications will soon have to close altogether. 
Journalists and editors appealed to Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin on 30 December to take urgent measures; and staff 
of Moscow publications and regional printing organizations have 
set up a strike committee, which demanded subsidies for 
publications that have already been subscribed to, and the means 
to participate in privatization. Unless something is done, the 
week parliament opens -- 10-17 January -- publication of 
newspapers will be suspended. 
  Over video of a news conference, Orlova goes on: "One should 
evidently forget about freedom and independence of the press, 
too. For the moment, only those publications and television and 
radio programs that are either financed by the government or 
belong to commercial organizations are able to survive. In a 
word, he who pays the piper plays the tune. Valeriy Kucher, 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editor in chief gave further evidence of this 
at a news conference today, citing information he said he had 
learned from authoritative government sources. A decree is 
being drawn up to close this newspaper and to set up on its 
basis a government organ named DERZHAVA (THE STATE). The reason 
for this is that just before the New Year, the editorial staff 
took its cue from the new Russian Constitution and announced 
that it was leaving the government's tutelage."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1100 GMT on 1 January carries a recorded program with 
correspondents Aleksey Abakumov and Marina Khomutova; 
commentator Sergey Kotenkov; "Vesti" program director Aleksandr 
Nekhoroshev, until recently director of the Radio Russia News 
Service; and correspondent Andrey Vishnevskiy of Radio Rossii's 
"Intercept" service. 
  Abakumov and Khomutova discuss the usual schedule of 
Russia's 
Radio News Service, which includes hourly news bulletins and 
news and analytical programs every four hours. They note that 
the News Service produces around 500 reports on various topics 
daily. 
  Abakumov says: "If one wants to discuss the matter 
seriously, then news and programs on the national channel of 
Russia's Radio are only the visible part of the iceberg. The 
News Service also includes current information on the Nostalgy 
musical station of Radio Rossii; Voice of Russia, a radio 
station for listeners in neighboring and distant foreign 
countries; and the Intercept agency--simply speaking, a service 
of radio interception." 
  Khomutova says they would like to give the listeners a 
better 
idea of Radio Rossii's studios and editorial offices. 
  She says: "Let us begin with the `Voice of Russia', since 
there is a formal reason for this: This station celebrates its 
fifth anniversary of broadcasts 24 hours a day on short wave on 
1 January. The majority of the listeners live in the near and 
far abroad. They are compatriots who have left their homeland 
temporarily or permanently due to different reasons. They also 
include those who studied and those who are currently studying 
the Russian language." 
  Abakumov adds: "These call signals were broadcast on the air 
for the first time on 1 January 1991. At the time, we took over 
from the Russian World Service of International Moscow Radio. 
Voice of Russia is the only state radio station in the Russian 
Federation currently broadcasting in Russian for audiences 
around the world. A total of 10 million listeners in more than 
60 countries can receive our programs on short waves." 
  Abakumov then invites listeners to listen to a report by 
special correspondent Valeriy Gorkin. Gorkin says that a friend 
of his once said to him that he did not see the fruits of 
Gorkin's work, whereas he, as a press correspondent, did see the 
results of his work when he saw his name under even a small 
article. Gorkin says that, after 25 years of work, he continues 
to enjoy listeners' reactions to his work by receiving letters 
and telephone calls from many listeners. He thanks the listeners 
for their kind words about the Voice of Russia. 
  Commentator Sergey Kotenkov then views political events that 
occurred in Russia in 1993--in particular, the people's behavior 
in the parliamentary elections in December. 
  Khomutova and Abakumov then discuss Radio Rossii's Nostalgy 
and report that it is only heard on the FM band in several 
Russian cities and is still popular in Russia and in France. 
They add that it has been popular for a number of years. 
  Khomutova introduces Nekhoroshev, until recently director of 
the Radio Rossii's News Service and currently the director of 
the "Vesti" program. He says that some are jealous of him 
moving to television. Khomutova says that his voice has become 
well known both to television and radio audiences. 
  Khomutova then introduces correspondent Andrey Vishnevskiy, 
who explains Radio Rossii's Intercept service. 
  Vishnevskiy says: "Listeners do not know us. We do not come 
on the air, with the exception of this brief appearance. We 
produce a bulletin that includes the most interesting and 
important reports of the world's leading radio stations. The 
bulletin consists of up to 20 printed pages daily. Our service, 
which has been independent for nearly three years, accepted a 
kind offer by Russia's Radio in December and has moved to in the 
Yamskoye Pole street. 
  "We hope that the fact that we have lost independence to a 
certain degree will not lead to giving up the main principle of 
Intercept, which is well-known to our old subscribers. 
Information of the main radio services in the world should be 
delivered to them unchanged. Moreover, it is not important 
whether it is liked or disliked. Do you want to know what Radio 
Liberty, the BBC, `Voice of America' and another dozen foreign 
radio stations said a few hours ago? If you do, you should 
subscribe to Russia's Radio Intercept bulletins. It is very 
easy to do this: Just telephone the number 250-2398." 
  Khomutova says that Abakumov has been appointed director of 
Russia's Radio News Service. Abakumov adds that actually he is 
combining his new job with that of being an announcer. 
Khomutova asks Abakumov to briefly tell the listeners about the 
News Service. 
  Abakumov says: "News Service means five hours of 
broadcasting a day on the national radio channel. It means the 
most recent information about events in Russia and neighboring 
and distant foreign countries, in the political, economic, and 
social spheres, and on culture, sports, and the weather. Let us 
say we have quite a few reports by our permanent and free lance 
correspondents both in this country and abroad; news of major 
news services, our experts, and what we call reliable 
sources--leading Russian and foreign agencies and the 
hyrdometeorological center." 
  Abakumov notes that all levels of the society are given a 
chance to express their views on the events in the country. All 
their interlocutors are always given respectable treatment. He 
says that all of what he has said has had some success, but much 
must still be done. His dream is to create the best news 
service in the world in the Russian language. 
  Khomutova then says that today is not a day just for 
business 
but also for leisure. A sample recording of a Nostalgy program 
follows. 
  Khomutova closes by saying it is difficult to tell the 
listeners about everything in 20 minutes but hopes that Radio 
Rossii has become closer to the listeners and conveys best 
wishes from all Radio Rossii's services.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Gusyakov, head of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI </F>
"documents department," under "KURYER Documents" rubric: "What 
KURYER Carries"] 
  [Text] In accordance with an edict of the Russian 
president, normative acts of central organs of state management 
are published for the first time only in ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI. Moreover, documents registered by the Ministry of 
Justice but not published in our newspaper do not entail legal 
consequences and are deemed not to have come into legal force. 
The reader of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI can find in the pages of the 
KURYER weekly supplement normative acts of Russian Federation 
ministries and departments which have undergone state 
registration. Before all other newspapers KURYER notifies 
Russians of the most recent changes to tax legislation, informs 
them of the procedure for floating shares, privatizing, and 
buying and selling private and state property, and publishes 
banking regulations, customs tariffs, and examples of 
departmental documentation. 
  Economic leaders, jurists, representatives of commercial 
structures, employees of financial and tax establishments and 
law enforcement organs, and also ordinary citizens whose rights, 
freedoms, and legitimate interests we are entrusted with 
representing by presidential edict can find in KURYER the 
answers to many topical questions, particularly those concerning 
the regulation of market mechanisms. KURYER has become their 
reliable guide in the legal and economic area which changes 
rapidly day by day. KURYER also ensures very prompt access to 
the "hottest" exclusive information from the norm-creating 
kitchen of ministries and departments. In short, those people 
who have not yet made out their subscription have an opportunity 
in the new year to think once again about their choice of 
publication. Those who have not had time to do this today will 
not be too late to do so tomorrow.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has brought into 
force the new program of privatization of state and municipal 
enterprises which is to regulate the privatization process in 
Russia beginning in 1994. 
  The approved state program does not greatly differ from the 
privatization program which was in effect in 1992-1993. The new 
program does not change the major peculiarity of the Russian 
legislature on privatization, namely privatization by means of 
vouchers; their term of operation is to expire on July 1, 1994. 
  In comparison with the previous one, the new state program 
expands rights of the regions and increases the list of sites, 
the privatization of which was earlier prohibited or restricted. 
  In addition, this document removes all restrictions for the 
participation of foreign investors in the privatization of 
Russian state property. According to the state program, foreign 
individuals and legal entities can participate in auctions and 
competitions organized to sell state property on equal rights 
with Russian investors. Foreign investors are allowed to 
procure state securities (including vouchers) without any 
coordination with the RF [Russian Federation] Finance Ministry 
(according to the decree on foreign investments, a foreigner had 
to receive permission from the Finance Ministry in order to buy 
state securities). 
  Chairman of Russia's State Property committee Dmitriy 
Vasilyev says that about 80% of state property is expected to be 
privatized by July 1, 1994. Currently, 45-50% of Russian 
property belongs to the private sector.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ruslan Maysigov] </F>
  [Text] Nazran January 4 TASS -- The new year has brought 
new problems into the Republic of Ingushetia where shops and 
everyday service facilities refuse to accept 50,000 rouble 
banknotes from their clients under various pretexts. 
  The republic has been lately swept by rumours about an 
upcoming money reform in Russia. Having learnt the bitter 
lesson of previous money reforms, workers and employees of state 
organisations and enterprises also refuse to take their salaries 
in 50,000 rouble notes. Earlier such rumours rattled the 
neighbouring Chechen Republic. 
  Meanwhile, black marketeers and shadow economy dealers are 
buying up the rejected bills for 45,000 roubles in banknotes of 
10,000 and 5,000 rouble denomination. 
  abdul-Khamid Aushev, a Russian Central Bank representative 
in 
Ingushetia, said that "such rumours are being spread by 
mafia-like structures and hard currency dealers for their own 
benefit." Aushev said he had contacted the Central Bank which 
had denied these rumours as groundless.

"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] [Shevtsov over video of troops on maneuvers] 
For the internal troops, just as for the entire country, this 
year has been extremely difficult and even dramatic. In the most 
difficult conditions, officers and men continued to guard 
important state installations and special cargoes as well as 
corrective-labor camps. 
  Together with other internal affairs personnel they 
performed 
successfully in the special operations Gastroler, Signal, Koltso 
and Arsenal. 
  In the state of emergency regions troop units carried out 
over 70 operations, seized thousands of firearms and other 
weapons, and saved the lives of hundreds of innocent people. 
  This and many other difficult problems and tasks for the 
internal troops were discussed today by Russian Ministry of 
Internal Affairs okrug commanders and troop training 
establishment chiefs who participated in an all-Russia rally.

<F P=106> [Report over video of test flight of new fighter aircraft; </F>
from the "Polygon" program] 
  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent over video of fighter 
aircraft on tarmac and taking off] No awesome name has yet been 
thought up for this aircraft. Its specifications remain secret 
for the time being, but even the first test flight has made it 
clear that what we see here is the super-fighter of the 21st 
century. In terms of flight specifications this fighter has no 
parallel in aviation history. Russian scientists and military 
people believe that this super-fighter will largely determine 
the development of world aircraft building. 
  It is amazing that this machine has appeared now, during a 
period of protracted economic crisis, Deputy Defense Minister 
Andrey Kokoshin and Russian Air Force Commander in Chief Petr 
Deynekin stressed in our interview. 
  [Kokoshin] The first flight has been very successful. I 
consider this an important milestone in the emergence of 
essentially a new-generation aircraft. 
  [Deynekin] I believe that we can confidently and objectively 
claim today that Russia always had, has, and will continue to 
have wings.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F>
rubric: "Military Ruse"] 
  [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry's General Staff has 
decided to carry out plans for its own reduction in its own 
manner. 
  It has become known to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS from reliable 
sources that not a single officer will be discharged from the 
General Staff. There will be a reduction nevertheless. Several 
subunits will be detached from General Staff directorates and 
transformed into several sectors [napravleniya]. All the 
officers will remain in their positions and will not lose even a 
kopeck of their salaries. Defense Ministry chiefs will be able 
to report a 30-percent personnel cut. 
  This is not the first time the military has resorted to such 
a ruse. At one time, the Central Command Post was withdrawn 
from the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff. 
Those at the top were told about a 50-percent cut. Several 
months after, part of the subunits were taken back. The same 
will happen now too.

  [Text] Moscow December 28 TASS -- Russia has good chances 
to double its exports of military equipment in 1994 thanks to 
the work in the past two years which can result in major 
contracts, according to Foreign Trade Minister Oleg Davydov. 
  According to experts of his ministry, Russia exported 
armaments worth 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. 
  A major contract on shipments of MiG-29 fighter planes to 
Malaysia is expected early next year, Davydov told Business-TASS 
on Tuesday. 
  The minister denied allegations that Russia had sustained 
considerable losses by ceasing military shipments to former 
Soviet allies as those were mostly free of charge deliveries. 
  "for political reasons we have stopped arms shipments to a 
number of warring countries - Afghanistan, Angola, Ethiopia and 
others. But Russia did not practically earn any money from that. 
Now the arms trade is going on only for hard currency", Davydov 
said. 
  The minister hopes the creation of the "Rosvooruzhenie" 
company which is to unite major Russian military exporters will 
open new prospects for arms trade. 
  He added that his ministry retains the licencing right, will 
draft intergovernmental agreements and carry out export control.

newscast] 
  [Excerpts] [Galkin over video of MiG assembly hall] This 
is the Moscow Aviation Production Association named for 
Dementyev. It is marking its centennial today. It all began 
with the "Duks" bicycle. [passage omitted] 
  Later the "Duks" plant became the "Znamya Truda," working 
exclusively for military aviation during the past decades and 
achieving unique productivity and quality. 
  However, perestroyka, together with a wrongly understood 
theory of conversion, almost made the plant lose its aviation 
specialization. Strange as it may seem, this giant plant was 
saved by the "Aviatika" light biplane, which is being assembled 
in the same premises as the awesome MiG-29. [passage omitted] 
  It has to be admitted that the Russian Government has not 
ordered a single aircraft yet. However, it seems that abroad 
demand for our aircraft equipment is growing. Although this 
path has its problems too.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Yershov report: "Combat Wing-in-Ground Effect </F>
Vehicle Will Come to the Rescue"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod's "Volga" plant is developing the 
"Spasatel" ["Rescue Worker"] wing-in-ground effect vehicle [WIG] 
-- a top secret project six months ago. 
  The Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau here in the past 
developed the designs on which the Russian high-speed river and 
maritime fleet was based -- the famous Raketas, Meteors, 
Voskhods, and Kolkhidas. R. Alekseyev, chief hydrofoil 
designer, for whom this central design bureau is now named, was 
a pioneer of this work. Only comparatively recently did it 
become known that a fundamentally new type of hydrofoil was 
created under his direction back in the sixties -- the 
wing-in-ground effect vehicle. 
  Whereas hydrofoils can develop speeds of up to 120 kph 
[kilometers per hour], a WIG craft has almost the speed of an 
aircraft -- up to 600 kph. In moving over the surface this 
vessel seems to break free from the water and hover above the 
surface. A huge advantage is that it is not necessary to build 
expensive take-off and landing strips for WIG craft; they can be 
based on water and on shore alike. The WIG craft can move over 
ice or a snowy surface and surmount any barriers. 
  The WIG craft, if it is successfully introduced, promises a 
real "transport breakthrough." According to specialists' 
assessments, the WIG craft belongs to the class of 21st century 
flying machines, and in this field we are at least 20-25 years 
ahead of many countries. 
  "Yes, we are the pioneers in the creation of WIG craft, but 
in recent times we have increasingly become aware of Western 
rivals 'breathing down our necks,'" Doctor of Technical Sciences 
A. Maskalik says. "If urgent measures are not taken, we could 
lose the advantage altogether. We have already designed and 
successfully tested WIG craft weighing up to 500 tonnes which 
can easily take off from, and land on, waves up to three meters 
high." 
  At the "Volga" plant a huge craft with towering, gleaming, 
duralumin sides stands on the building slipway. It is 77 meters 
long, with a wingspan of 42 meters; the largest dimensions of 
the fuselage are equal to those of a six-story block. This 
craft was ordered by the military and is more than 80 percent 
ready. But work has been mothballed for almost two years. 
There was serious talk about whether to ax the craft 
altogether.... 
  In three decades the Nizhniy Novgorod plant has been 
allocated funds for the entire "WIG program" which would suffice 
for only half the cost of a single Il-76 aircraft. In his time 
R. Alekseyev managed to bring together many talented young 
specialists, made it possible to create the first studies for 
the new flying machines to the highest standard. In recent 
years, because of a lack of funding, many of those who pioneered 
this work have been forced to leave the collective. Almost 150 
designers and project workers now work in the "Tekhnologiya i 
transport" joint-stock company, developing marine WIG craft of 
various capacities to meet an order from a foreign firm. Some 
$2 million has been poured into this project, and the first test 
models should be manufactured and tested next year. The Nizhniy 
Novgorod Aviation Plant is involved in the creation of small WIG 
patrol craft [ekranoplany-katery].... 
  Maybe this is for the best -- the Central Hydrofoil Design 
Bureau will have competitors, which promises the speediest 
assimilation of the new flying technology. On the other hand, 
the efforts of the specialists have been dissipated, and the 
very rich scientific potential has been diluted. But one thing 
is indisputable -- we must not lose our edge in WIG building. 
At the same time, many firms in the United States, France, 
Germany, and Japan are ready to join in the development of new 
WIG craft with payloads of 1,500 tonnes. Talks on such 
cooperation are under way. 
  I climbed together with V. Kirillov, the project's chief 
designer, onto the building slipway of the half-built 
"Spasatel," which occupied almost the whole of a workshop 
several football fields in length. The "Spasatel" weighs 390 
tonnes; it has a speed of up to 550 kph and a range of 
3,000-4,000 km; the craft can carry up to 500 people. As my 
companion remarked, the "Spasatel" has the dimensions of the 
well-known "Ruslan" and "Mriya" aircraft. A hospital with an 
operating theater and a resuscitation ward are envisaged here, 
and also a special treatment post for providing aid to people 
injured as a result of accidents in nuclear power installations 
or in chemical strikes. The crew is equipped with inflatable 
boats, ladders, and other rescue apparatus for operations in 
conditions of strong sea gales. 
  All the same, the new WIG craft for peaceful purposes does 
not yet have as rosy a future as one would like. The point is 
that, effectively, these flying machines could be used in the 
form of combined units consisting of three craft. The total 
requirement for them in the initial period is at least 15 or so 
vessels, but this already means profitable series production. 
But at the moment the "Volga" plant complains of a shortage of 
funds, which the Ministry of Defense is dishing out in overly 
small portions. Meanwhile Russia's first "Spasatel," which is 
awaited on the seas, is scheduled to leave the slipway this year.

<F P=106> [By Mikhail Zotov and Valeriy Rekuta from Moscow Radio </F>
Technical Plant; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Zotov] This half-empty hall once housed a unit for 
the installation of electronics in missiles. Now Grundig color 
television sets are being assembled here in a remote corner. 
And although the Moscow Radio Technical Plant still does not 
have a signboard, this once-secret military facility is not 
secret any more. 
  In the kingdom of defense agencies everything is topsy-turvy 
nowadays. More than 70 percent of the plant's output consists 
of civilian goods and only 30 percent is military output. The 
military output includes the renowned electronics for the 
super-modern air defense missile complexes which are superior to 
Western counterparts. 
  Incidentally, the plant, which is now a leasehold 
enterprise, 
could end the production of all military output without any 
financial or legal liability even if this were to the detriment 
of the country's defense capability. After all, there is still 
no law on state orders. There are other reasons, too. So, for 
example the plant received nothing from the sale to China of 
several air defense systems apart from down-filled jackets and 
some bedding which the workers immediately dubbed "foot cloths." 
  [M. Milovanov, Moscow Radio Technical Plant general 
director, 
identified by caption] We want to survive and we are doing our 
utmost to ensure that we do. The plant management is constantly 
in an impossible situation as a result of Defense Ministry 
defaulting on payments; 1993 is drawing to a close and we are 
still owed 7.352 billion rubles [R]. We in turn owe our 
suppliers R1.5 billion. 
  [Zotov] The work force of this plant, which posseses unique 
military technologies, is barely managing to get by thanks to 
the production of own "Yunost" color television sets and the 
assembly of German TV sets. It could be that they will usher in 
the next New Year minus missile complexes, but in down-filled 
jackets and with Grundig television sets. [Video shows interior, 
exterior of plant, TV set assembly, missile complexes being 
assembled and tested, interview with director, more footage of 
production facilities.]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Maley, chairman of the National </F>
Security Council's Inter-Ministerial Committee dealing with 
military industry, by Laszlo Vida; place and date not given: 
"Only the Military Industrial Complex Can Ensure the 
Continuation of the Reforms, Mikhail Maley, a Chief Lobbyist of 
the `Oboronka' Says"] 
  [Text] The further neglect of the needs of the military 
industrial complex is dangerous for President Yeltsin's power 
and for the whole, still mainly state-owned, economy, Mikhail 
Maley, a chief lobbyist of the defense establishment, the 
oft-mentioned "oboronka," said in his interview to MAGYAR 
NEMZET. Maley is also the chairman of the National Security 
Council's Inter-Ministerial Committee dealing with military 
industry, which operates beside the Russian president. 
  [Vida] Not long before the September crisis, you resigned 
your position as presidential adviser and expressed your 
dissatisfaction with the current economic policy in a sharp 
interview in the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. Are you still so 
pessimistic about the future of Russian military industry? 
  [Maley] The economic situation has not improved but the 
situation is much better from a structural point of view. The 
president has acquired full powers. The existence of the 
National Security Council has also been included in the 
Constitution, which is particularly important in the coming 
transitional period, when coalition debates make the 
government's work more difficult, because its 10 committees can 
in theory deal with any issues and substitute for any 
ministries. All this gives us great hope. At the same time, 
the results of the elections carry the danger that the political 
struggle will again draw Yeltsin away from the economy's burning 
problems. Necessary decisions are being delayed while time is 
running out before our eyes. Within three to five months at the 
latest, we have to begin massive changes in the economy.... 
  [Vida] Do you want a change of course? 
  [Maley] I would not be with the president if I did not agree 
with the reform policy. What is more, 80 percent of the 
military industrial complex's directors would not agree to any 
kind of regress. We do not want to and cannot return to what 
was here before. All we want from Yeltsin is that he should 
make the reforms quicker and more thought-out so that we can at 
last begin to establish a new economy on the ruins of 1992 and 
1993. Therefore, we are supporting him as we did in October, 
but we are also trying to convince him of our views. 
  [Vida] It is interesting what you are saying because one of 
the basic tenets of Gaydar's reform ideology is that the 
military industrial complex as a social phenomenon is a 
conservative and reactionary factor. 
  [Maley] It is possible that, because of its outward 
characteristics, the oboronka appears to be a conservative 
force, but scientific life is concentrated here just as it is 
anywhere else in the world. The denouncement of military 
industry was a methodical mistake on Gaydar's part. Instead of 
using it as a motor for the reforms, he set himself the task of 
destroying it. No government will be able to do this. This 
industry has found the suitable counteraction because the line 
of enterprises with the chain of loans actually began with us. 
The strategically accumulated stocks of raw material in 
military industry, which was compulsory in the past, made it 
possible for production to continue. At the moment, the most 
important thing is that the president, who had been made to 
believe that the "oboronka" was an antagonistic environment, has 
understood that the Gaydar approach is wrong. However, we had to 
wait 18 months for this, the fight against the military industry 
lasted as long as that. 
  [Vida] How can the political situation that has emerged 
after the elections influence the prospects of the military 
industry? 
  [Maley] All in all, the defense establishment came out 
victorious from the political shocks of the past few months. 
First of all, this is because we support Yeltsin and he is 
beginning to understand that we are the only means left for 
continuing the reforms. Secondly, the serious defeat of the 
Gaydar bloc, Russia's Choice, actually means the defeat of the 
enemies of military industry, and this will probably be a 
warning for those who still have not realized what kind of force 
they are facing. Finally, as the military industry is an island 
of calm and social peace, all political forces will try to win 
us over. In order to gain as precise as possible information on 
the interests of the military industrial complex, we will soon 
establish an electronic information system including all 2,200 
enterprises, with the help of which we can ask the views of the 
directors and trade union leaders of all of these enterprises on 
important issues within a few hours. 
  We would as soon as possible like to launch the experiment 
of 
economic reform that will affect the Udmurtia, Mari, and 
Chuvashia Republics, and Nizhniy Novgorod and Moscow counties, 
namely the areas where the military industry is concentrated. 
We will maximally decentralize the control of the economy and 
make this industry export-oriented. According to our plans, 70 
percent of the foreign currency income would go to the regions 
and only the remaining amount would have to be given to the 
federal budget. We will request bids for the military programs 
and the winner will be the supplier of the Army while the losers 
will be able to go to the international markets with their own 
solutions. 
  [Vida] What changes do you consider necessary in Russian 
foreign politics to establish favorable conditions for the 
Russian military industry on foreign markets? 
  [Maley] First of all, we need pragmatism. We will restore 
the state monopoly of weapons exports. The president himself 
will approve the one-year and five-year export plans. We will 
market our latest military equipment: We would always like to 
sell one dollar cheaper and one technical unit better products 
than our competitors. If you observe the activities of Kozyrev, 
you will see that he reached pragmatism from an absolutely 
pacifist position, he realized that the markets that we are 
leaving are immediately taken up by his closest friends over the 
ocean, without the slightest sign of a guilty conscience. Even 
under the current circumstances, when we have lost many of our 
traditional partners, we consider it possible to get some $10 to 
12 billion a year from weapons exports by 1995. 
  [Vida] To what extent is Russia able to work together with 
Ukraine and the other successor states in military production? 
  [Maley] In this area, our relations continue to be 
excellent. Russia is the only one of the Soviet Union's 
successor states that, as a last resort, could be fully 
self-sufficient, the others cannot even cover 30 percent of 
their military needs on their own. Therefore, integration is 
unavoidable, providing our neighbors understand the realities. 
What if they do not? We have already taught a lesson with 
energy resources, which mainly made Ukraine suffer, and we can 
provide another lesson. Weapons are even more expensive than 
oil or gas.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS string correspondent Semyon Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, January 5 (TASS) -- Forty eight carrier 
rockets blasted off the launching pads of Baykonur (Kazakhstan) 
and Plesetsk (Russia) during 1993. The rockets launched 59 
different space apparatuses into orbit. The share of Plesetsk 
northern "space harbour" -- amounted to 26 carrier rockets and 
36 space apparatuses. 
  A two-thirds of the space apparatus launchings were carried 
out for the Russian Defence Ministry, and the rest were for 
other ministries and departments. The most often used rockets 
were the R-7a -- three-stage "Soyuz" carrier rockets (18 
launchings) and the "Molnia" four-stage -- (8). Sixty-five per 
cent of all space apparatuses were put into orbit during the 
first half of 1993. The second quarter of 1993 turned out to be 
the busiest period, with 24 Russian satellite launchings. 
  Such a tight launching schedule of launchings became 
possible 
only thanks to the hard work put in by the personnel of space 
military forces of Russia, three of whom, officers Aleksey 
Metelkin, Andrey Nesytov and Vladimir Dubovik (all from 
Plesetsk) were decorated with military awards on orders of the 
president of the Russian Federation for displaying courage in 
conditions which endangered their lives. 
  But the number of launches in 1993 was less than that 
carried 
out in 1992, when 55 carrier rockets put 75 space apparatuses 
into orbit. This was, firstly, due to the introduction of a new 
generation of space systems with long-term functioning periods 
in space. For example, the global navigational satellite system 
was inducted in 1993. Secondly, due to inadequate state 
financing, 1993 was the first year not a single carrier rocket 
complex for scientific purposes was launched. 
  Besides this, the "Proton" carrier rocket disaster of May 
27, 
1993 delayed carrier rocket launchings for four months. As a 
result, only three "Proton" launchings could take place by the 
end of 1993. 
  Nevertheless, the new year promises to be sufficiently busy. 
This year's programme will begin with the launching of the 
"Soyuz TM-18" manned space ship which is scheduled to be put 
into orbit on January 8.

of Moldovan-Russian negotiations on the statute, condition, and 
terms of the 14th Army's withdrawal will take place at the end 
of January in Chisinau, states the Press Secretariat of the 
Moldovan Ministry of Defense. According to sources at this 
Ministry, the previous round was suspended because Moldovan 
representatives insisted, among others, on compensating the 14th 
Army presence in Moldova. Moldovan representatives also 
insisted on 1 July as the final day of the Russian troops' 
withdrawal. Previously, the Press Secretariat of the Ministry 
of Defense made a protest declaration denying Stepan Kitsak's 
affirmations. Stepan Kitsak declared that the Moldovan Ministry 
of Defense took the property and equipment of the Battalion 2 
Cable And Radio of the 14th Army.

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 3/01/1994 -- The state 
committee for radio and TV of the self-proclaimed Dniester 
Republic has decided to deny the accreditation of Lev Rozenberg, 
reporter of the Russian EXPRESS KHRONIKA news agency at the 
Tiraspol Supreme Soviet. The reason is an article published in 
EXPRESS KHRONIKA No. 45 regarding some actions of the Tiraspol 
authorities last October, including the voyage of commandos to 
Moscow to defend the White House. Although many Moscow 
publications proved that Tiraspol was involved in the bloodshed, 
it is the first time when Tiraspol authorities deny the 
accreditation of a Russian journalist.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 5 Jan -- The ITAR-TASS correspondent has 
learned from sources at the command headquarters of the Russian 
frontier troops in Tajikistan that yesterday afternoon a well 
armed grouping of Tajik fighters tried to invade the territory 
of Tajikistan from Afghanistan in the sector of the outpost of 
the Pyandzh frontier detachment (in the south of the republic). 
As a result of the armed clash, which lasted approximately five 
hours, two of the trespassers were killed and the remainder 
returned to the adjacent bank of the river. Yesterday two armed 
groups also tried to break through in several sections of the 
Pyandzh frontier detachment from the territory of Afghanistan. 
They were, however, halted by the fire of the Russian frontier 
guards. There are no casualties among the Russian servicemen. 
  At the present time, it was stressed at the command 
headquarters, the situation in the sector of the Pyandzh 
frontier detachment is being kept under control by the joint 
actions of the Russian frontier guards and the sub-units of 
Tajikistan's National Security Committee.

  [Text] New Delhi January 4 TASS -- "Our visit to India has 
been successful. We have fulfilled all our plans. The visit 
has been rather fruitful. India and Uzbekistan have big 
possibilities for developing cooperation," Uzbekistan's 
President Islam Karimov said. 
  The announcement was made in an interview with ITAR-TASS on 
Tuesday on the second day of Karimov's official visit to India. 
"We have reached understanding with India in the sphere of 
economy and culture, as well as diplomacy and in determining our 
common positions in order to ensure stability in Central Asia 
and the entire region," Karimov stressed. 
  "We are connected with India, this great Asian power with a 
great potential, by both similar mentality and common historic 
roots. Now new possibilities for cooperation are opening up 
before us," he said. 
  On Tuesday, Karimov held talks with Indian Foreign Minister 
Dinesh Singh and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh. He also met 
with representatives of Indian business circles and attended a 
ceremony at the Jawaharlal Nehru University where he was awarded 
an honorary degree of doctor of law.

<F P=106> [Albert Musin report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F>
"Uzbekistan"] 
  [Excerpts] In the two days of its deliberations, the 
Supreme Soviet session has considered over 40 matters, including 
20 draft laws. [passage omitted] 
  As key news agencies have already reported, President 
Karimov 
vehemently opposed the introduction of dual citizenship in 
Uzbekistan, citing the need to make sure that all Uzbekistan 
citizens retain "the feeling of patriotism." Karimov suggested 
that Russia "not interfere in Uzbekistan's internal affairs." 
Undoubtedly, what he meant by this was Andrey Kozyrev's trip to 
Tashkent in November, when the Russian Foreign Ministry chief 
raised the question of ethnic Russians' assuming dual 
citizenship as a measure designed to prevent their mass 
migration from Uzbekistan. 
  Even before starting official talks with Kozyrev, the 
Uzbekistan president took the Russian ambassador to Tashkent to 
task in front of journalists, saying that he "will have to 
answer" for "raising the specious problem of the 
Russian-speaking population in Uzbekistan." Later, the 
journalists who rushed to the Russian Embassy saw a line of 700 
people craving to obtain Russian citizenship and leave 
Uzbekistan... 
  Also on the agenda were matters of the state budget and the 
socioeconomic situation in Uzbekistan, although they were barely 
touched.

of enterprises. According to the resolution, enterprises, 
organizations, and associations of all forms of ownership are 
obliged to pay a 15 percent tax on foreign currency earnings to 
the hard currency fund, and another 15 percent must be sold to 
the republic's Central Bank. On the conclusion of barter 
export-import operations, the amount of earnings will be 
calculated from the value of the contract. Work on special 
measures to monitor the movement of money in foreign currency, 
in order to exclude the possibility of the unauthorized holding 
of money in foreign banks, is also envisaged.

  [Text] Deputy Economy Minister Armen Darbinyan has reported 
plans for Economy Minister Armen Yegiazaryan and First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Zhirair Liparityan to visit Washington. They 
will visit the IMF to hold talks on economic cooperation and 
will provide detailed information to the Fund's directors on the 
latest political developments. 
  Armenia has long been conducting talks with the IMF but the 
situation in the region means the IMF thinks it is inappropriate 
to allocate money to Armenia and Azerbaijan out of the 
stabilization fund for countries moving toward independence; the 
argument is that the resources could be directly or indirectly 
used for nonpeaceful purposes. 
  To dispel such an opinion, the Armenian president recently 
wrote to IMF Managing Director Camdessus expressing the hope 
that the IMF will soften its stance since Armenia is not a 
warring side and the international community has not recognized 
it as such. 
  Once in Washington, the Armenian delegation will reiterate 
our country's position, that is, to help in every way to 
establish peace in the region.

  [Text] Moscow, 4 Jan -- Fighting is continuing in the north 
and northeast of Nagorno-Karabakh. The ITAR-TASS correspondent 
was told today by the department of press and information of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] that on Monday evening subunits 
of the Azerbaijani Army, which had gone on the offensive, were 
forced to retreat to their original positions after losing two 
armored vehicles and with around 90 soldiers and officers 
killed. Five soldiers were killed and 13 injured on the 
Karabakh side. 
  According to a report from the news service of the NKR 
defense army, instances of Azerbaijani servicemen voluntarily 
giving themselves up as prisoners have increased. Fourteen 
people have done this over the past two weeks. The prisoners 
say that they are being forced into this because they are 
frightened of being shot by mine-laying detachments coming from 
behind. Among the soldiers in the mine-laying detachments are 
Afghan mojahedin and the fact of their involvement in the 
Karabakh war on the Azerbaijani side is admitted by both 
military experts and independent observers. 
  According to the NKR State Committee for Defense, there are 
more than 40 seized documents in Stepanakert that show that 
around 1,500 Afghan mojahedin are involved in the conflict on 
the Azerbaijani side. They came to Azerbaijan as far back as 
July last year. The mojahedin's subunits are also suffering 
losses.

  [Text] Baku -- The gradual transition to a regular army is 
the reason for the recent successes scored by the Azerbaijanis 
against the Armenians. The transformation of the Presidential 
Guard, which is directly attached to President Geydar Aliyev, 
into a "regular army" has brought the victory nearer. The 
guardsmen are being trained at a location some 50-km from Baku 
to adapt to any natural environment. The Azerbaijani commanders 
in their turn have been trained by the officers of the Turkish 
Armed Forces. 
<H5>  The Discipline of the Turkish Army </H5>
  The [Azerbaijani] commanders are saying: "We were trained by 
Turkish officers. Had we received this training beforehand, the 
Armenians would not have been able to occupy our lands." 
Indicating that their military discipline is fashioned after 
the discipline in the Turkish Army, the commanders are saying: 
"The Armenians will now see how we fight. The previous defeats 
were not our fault. The volunteer units were the cause for our 
reverses. Any person wanting to fight must fight under the 
command of the national army."

  [Text] On January 3, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev 
received commander of the Russian border troops Colonel-General 
Andrey Nikolayev to discuss cooperation between the Azerbaijani 
and Russian border troops. A well informed source in the 
Azerbaijani president's staff told Interfax that Moscow would 
like to help Baku protect the Azerbaijani section of the CIS 
borders. 
  The same source noted, however, that the inviolability of 
the 
Azerbaijani border with Armenia was the most important issue at 
the moment. "We demand the territorial integrity and 
inviolability of our borders," Geydar Aliyev stated during the 
talks. "Azerbaijan will work to ensure this," he added. 
  Aliyev also demonstrated Azerbaijan's readiness for 
constructive cooperation with Russia in the protection of 
Azerbaijan's external borders. 
  Both Aliyev and Nikolayev stated that their countries 
advocated peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict.

  [Text] Baku, January 4 (AZERTAC)--Yesterday, President 
Aliyev and Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev, supreme commander 
of the Russian Federation Frontiers Defence Forces, discussed on 
the question of ensuring the CIS frontiers security. 
  The Azerbaijani president expressed his readiness to 
cooperate in the field of protection of the border between the 
two countries as well as the frontiers between the Commonwealth 
and its neighbours. According to him, both issues mentioned are 
narrowly related to one another and must be dealt with together. 
The president thinks that this approach is in accordance with 
the spirit of the treaty on common security of the CIS. Urgent 
measures in order to implement the Treaty have recently been 
evaluated out at the Ashgabat summit. In respect to this, Mr. 
Aliyev has expressed his concern about the situation in Azeri 
districts bordering Armenia. 170 kms of the frontier between 
the two countries are under control of Armenian troops. 
President Aliyev also pointed out that the frontier between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia has turned into an arena of military 
operations. 
  The commander-in-chief of the Russian frontier troops is 
giving priority to the reinforcement of the security of 
frontiers between the CIS and neighbouring countries. He has 
pointed out that it was necessary to coordinate measures to be 
taken in this context. Russia and Azerbaijan have to work out a 
definite concept of how to cooperate in this field, he said. 
  In his short statement made to the local media, Mr. Andrey 
Nikolayev said that negotiations would continue, including the 
issue of mutual cooperation as far as the frontiers protection 
is concerned. Mr. Nikolayev evaded a question on plans of the 
possible stationing of Russian frontier troops on the border 
between Azerbaijan and Iran. Everything depends on the eventual 
terms agreed upon by both parties, he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Viktor </F>
Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku January 4 TASS -- "Any offensive, the more so 
aggressive actions of the Azeri Army fighting on its territory 
to liberate the motherland are out of the question," Azeri 
Defence Minister Major-general Mamedrafi Mamedov told an 
exclusive ITAR-TASS interview here today. 
  He stressed "the National Army units had to involve in 
fierce 
defensive fighting and have managed to force the enemy out from 
the occupied populated localities". 
  "In the first days of the new year they deterred the enemy's 
attack in the Adgam direction near the Agdam regional center 
seized in summer 1993. Successful counter-actions have resulted 
in the destruction of seven tanks and two apcs. More than 200 
soldiers of the enemy were killed, several villages were taken 
under the national army control. There are no Armenian units in 
these villages, but they are under constant shelling which 
prevents the local population from returning home", he said. 
  The defence minister estimated as protracted position 
fighting combat operations in the Azeri west, where the national 
army units have crossed the Murovdag Ridge between the Azeri 
south-west and north-west and continue to move towards the 
Kelbajar region occupied in April 1993. The situation in the 
Beylagan direction in the republic's south-west remains 
complicated, as the Azeris are holding the line against the 
attacking Armenian units. 
  According to the recent reports, the situation has 
aggravated 
in the north-western border Kazakh region. The latter was put 
under rocket-artillery shelling from the Armenian Noyemberyan 
region on Monday, which resulted in considerable destructions 
and losses amongst civilians. The Azeris responded with the 
suppression of several fire nests on the adjoining territory. 
  The general reported the capture of a major military storage 
of the enemy in the Geranboy region located outside 
Nagorno-Karabakh. According to him, the Armenians planed to use 
the storage's arms in another large-scale offensive inside 
Azerbaijan. 
  The minister is convinced combat operations on Azeri 
territory could have been stopped long ago if no additional 
materiel and personnel were sent from Armenian territory almost 
every day. In January the Armenians moved reserves to the Agdam 
area, where they had had only advanced security element. As a 
result, the situation was considerably aggravated.

  [Text] Azerbaijan, which liberated two settlements after 
repulsing Armenian attacks, started the new year by celebrating 
the "Day of solidarity of Azerbaijanis all over the world." 
  Former President Abulfaz Elchibey, who was removed from 
power 
by a coup in 1993, issued a message stating that "an independent 
and democratic Azerbaijan is a major threat to imperialist 
forces." Indicating that Azerbaijan is living under extremely 
grave conditions, Elchibey called on the Azerbaijani diaspora to 
help the refugees. Elchibey repeated his call for unity and 
togetherness and said no power will manage to divide the people. 
  In the meantime, opposition is growing against Geydar 
Aliyev, 
whose position has weakened because of growing economic disarray 
and further loss of territory after the fall of Elchibey. The 
detentions of the leaders of People's Front and Musavat Party, 
which forged a national unity on the instructions of Elchibey, 
is continuing. The reporters are under pressure following the 
introduction of censorship against the opposition papers. It is 
being reported that Mahir Memedov, one of the directors of the 
paper DZHUMHURIYET, has been detained and is being asked to 
resign his job. 
  Geydar Aliyev, who disbanded the 37 volunteer battalions 
formed during the Elchibey era, has now ordered the detention of 
Adil Hashimoglu, who has been commanding the volunteer 
detachments since the start of the war with Armenians. Adil 
Hashimoglu, who commanded the units in Kubatlinskiy and 
Zangelanskiy Rayons at the request of Elchibey and who was 
instrumental in the latest military successes, was detained on 
the pretext that in complicity with the People's Front he was 
plotting a coup in Ganja against Aliyev. The detention of 
Hashimoglu, coming soon after the imprisonment of the people's 
hero Arif Pashaogly and Chief of the Security Directorate in 
Kazakhskiy Rayon, caused a reaction among the refugees in Ganja 
and Baku. 
<H5>  Demirel Invited Aliyev </H5>
  It was agreed to set up a group to draw up a border 
agreement 
between Azerbaijan and Turkey. It was confirmed that the 
borders of Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic cannot 
be altered forcibly and that the 1921 Kars treaty recognizes 
guarantorship rights to Turkey. 
  In a statement issued by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and 
Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, it was stated: 
"Turkey will not remain a mere spectator if an attempt is made 
to forcibly alter the borders of Nakhichevan Autonomous 
Republic." 
  In seeing off Gasan Gasanov at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, 
Hikmet Cetin handed him a personal letter from President 
Suleyman Demirel. Cetin said that the letter is an invitation to 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev to visit Turkey. 
  Gasanov stated that Aliyev will visit Turkey most probably 
in 
January and added that the Turkic republics' heads of state 
summit, which was held in Ankara on 29 October last year, will 
be held in Baku between 20-22 January.

  The working group preparing the draft has almost completed 
work on the text. Nonetheless, it still has to be "polished." 
The experience of the independent states proclaimed following 
the collapse of the Union has shown that the adoption of a 
constitution that is new in content is a protracted and 
labor-intensive process. It would be inappropriate to rush such 
an important job.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Military Procuracy has revealed that 
the members of the Azerbaijani National Army are heroically 
fighting on the battlefront to liberate our homeland from the 
enemy. But it also said the following: 
  Many have been martyred and many others have become national 
heroes, the pride of our people. But some have also displayed 
cowardice and fled the ranks of the military forces at this 
difficult time for our homeland. Several have taken their arms 
and other material with them. Such people cannot be forgiven. 
So the deserters will be punished severely. They may even be 
sentenced to death. 
  Acting in a humanitarian way, the Republic's leaders have 
decided to give them the opportunity to rectify their criminal 
behavior by voluntarily returning to fight on the battlefront. 
So, a department has been established within the Azerbaijani 
Military Procuracy's framework. No criminal charges will be 
brought against deserters who voluntarily apply for military 
service before 3 January 1994. The applications must be made to 
the following address: Azerbaijan [word indistinct], no. 30, 
Baku City. 
  That applies to all deserters, regardless of when they fled 
their units. If they don't, criminal charges will be brought 
against them and they will be severely punished. We have the 
strength and the means to do so.

  [Text] Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsiya expressed 
hope that the Georgian-Ossetian conflict would be entirely 
settled this year and tens of thousands of refugees would be 
able to return to their homes in South Ossetia. The premier 
voiced this statement in the village of Tamaresheni in South 
Ossetia, which he visited on January 3. 
  The press center of the Georgian government reported to 
Interfax that the premier had a meeting with the command of the 
Russian and Ossetian peacekeeping battalions on the territory of 
the Russian military unit not far from Tskhinvali, an 
administrative center in South Ossetia. Since July 1992, these 
battalions have been overseeing the cease-fire in this region 
together with Georgian servicemen. 
  Patsatsiya also visited several Georgian villages in South 
Ossetia where he promised the local population to provide them 
with food products and other necessary consumer goods. 
  The Georgian-Ossetian conflict began in January 1991 as a 
result of Georgian forces introduced into South Ossetia after 
the South Ossetian leadership declared its intention to raise 
the status of South Ossetia.

Abkhazian Head, expressed his skeptical attitude to the 
Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations which should take place on 
January 11. Speaking yesterday to the Gudauta radio Ardzinba 
said that Abkhazia will never be the part of Georgia. Abkhazia 
won the war, that's why Abkhazia should determine the conditions 
at the negotiations. 
  Meanwhile, Aleksandr Kavsadze, Shevardnadze's representative 
in the conflict zones, told SNARK the war was without the 
victors and vanquished. He is of the opinion that Ardzinba is 
being supported by the concrete political forces who are deeply 
interested in the tension in the region.

  [Text] The special situation regime has been tightened 
throughout the territory of Abkhazia. The reason is that during 
the post-war period a lot of time has been spent on setting up 
law enforcement bodies and strengthening them with 
professionals, time which has been used by criminal elements. 
By the end of 1993, a RIA correspondent was told by Konstantin 
Adleber, chief of staff of the Abkhazian MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] Headquarters, that the number of particularly 
serious crimes has been considerably reduced. Those who violate 
the curfew are now subjected to a fine of 5,000 rubles or 
detained for 3-15 hours. No military servicemen or other 
persons carrying weapons are allowed on the streets. The sale 
of spirits has been banned.

  [Excerpts] Koba Kobaidze, a journalist, is here in our 
studio. 
  [Kobaidze] I welcome you again, dear radio listeners. You 
are well aware that, by a decision of the city commandant's 
office, the curfew was lifted in Tbilisi on 1 and 2 January. 
Commandant Zaza Chachua will speak about the results of this 
move. 
  [Begin recording] [Chachua] People kept shooting and walking 
in the streets. There were road accidents and other things. 
  [Kobaidze] What can you envisage in the long run? 
  [Chachua] In the long run? The curfew must become as strict 
as possible and the administrative bodies must handle everything 
more firmly. [passage omitted] 
  [Kobaidze] How long do you think Tbilisi will need a curfew? 
  [Chachua] Some more months. At least six months I think. 
This is the least. [passage omitted, new year greetings and 
wishes] [end recording]

  [Text] Rumors persist in the republic to the effect that 
units of Russian Armed Forces have been brought in to Georgia. 
Major General Dyukov, deputy commander of the Transcaucasian 
group of Russian troops, has refuted this information, stating 
that only a positive resolution adopted on this issue at the 
upcoming Russo-Georgian summit will make it possible to bring 
any additional contingent of Russian Armed Forces into Georgia.

  [Text] Public statements by Tbilisi police chief David 
Zeikidze who said that a few hundred Russian servicemen would be 
sufficient for the effective implementation of the state of 
emergency regime in the Georgian capital -- just as this had 
been the case in the Black Sea port of Poti -- were today 
unexpectedly transformed into rumors embroidered with improbable 
details. 
  Thus it was claimed that in the past 24 hours crack subunits 
of the Feliks Dzerzhinskiy Moscow Division of Russia's Internal 
Affairs troops had landed at the airport in the Tbilisi suburb 
of Vaziani and that as early as tomorrow they would, together 
with the republic's law enforcement bodies, start jointly 
patrolling the Georgian capital. 
  Representatives of the command of the Russian force in the 
Transcausus, the press secretariat of the head of the Georgian 
State, and the press secretariat of the republic's competent 
bodies flatly denied this latest piece of news.

  [Text] CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY reports that the Georgian 
head of state's decree on guarding oil pipelines passing through 
Georgian territory and securing order at oil-prospecting sites 
has entitled the Georgian Interior Ministry and the petroleum 
department to begin implementing the decree immediately. An 
agreement has been signed between these two offices according to 
which the petroleum department has purchased appropriate 
equipment and firearms for the Interior Ministry. First Deputy 
Interior Minister General Gela Lanchava has taken personal 
responsibility in supervising the guard over the pipelines and 
sites. [passage omitted] 
  By the implementation of the decree, oil output will rise 
from 30 to 150 tonnes per day. The area guarded is being 
extended and consequently the quantity of oil extracted will 
also increase. In the very near future, Australian, American, 
and British firms will start oil-prospecting and geological 
surveying as well as the construction of small oil refineries.

"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text][Ratishvili over video of new aircraft on tarmac] 
The Tbilisi Aviation Production Association together with the 
Yakovlev Design Bureau have built a new-generation six-seater 
passenger plane -- the Yak-58. It is designed for executive and 
business flights but can be reequipped, without special 
additional expenditure, to function as an air ambulance or 
training or cargo plane. Its short takeoff and landing means 
that it can be used on improvised grass airstrips. 
  The creation of this aircraft marks the revival of mutually 
advantageous economic relations between the two states. A few 
days ago at the test range the new aircraft took off with 
enviable ease and reaching the required height successfully 
passed its first test. Present at the test range were head of 
the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze, Prime Minister Otar 
Patsatsia, and Georgian and foreign journalists.

  [Text] Cheboksary, 5 Jan -- Boris Yeltsin greeted Nikolay 
Fedorov on his election as Chuvashia's first president. 
  "I am confident that you will proceed further with economic 
reforms for the sake of making the life of the Chuvash people 
dignified and that you will facilitate the strengthening of 
Russia's constitutional foundations. I look forward to carrying 
out constructive work together," emphasized the Russian 
Federation president in his telegram.

  [Text] The democratic forces of Dagestan may boycott the 
forthcoming parliamentary elections if the republic's leaders 
decide to form the parliament's upper chamber out of the local 
administrators, the headquarters of the Congress of Dagestan's 
Democratic Forces told Interfax. "Such a decision will be 
perceived as one more attempt to dupe the people and save the 
authority of the former party bureaucrats," the same source 
stated. 
  A political statement reflecting this belief is expected to 
be adopted during the Congress's meeting on Wednesday. This 
document will also contain a request for holding parliamentary 
election in April or May, 1994, not on June 12. In addition, 
the Congress is to discuss the possibility of holding a 
conference of democratic forces for working out a common 
election platform and forming an election bloc. Such a decision 
was motivated by the results of the elections on December 12, 
when the communists received 53.7% of the votes. 
  The Congress's headquarters also told Interfax that 
terrorism 
might be stepped up against the democratic deputies on the eve 
of the elections. 
  The number of assassinations is the greatest in Dagestan. 
Over the past three years, 57 people have been killed for 
political reasons.

  [Text] Chechen leaders are planning to organize 
neighborhood watch teams and mobile militia groups to maintain 
order around the clock. According to Interfax sources, such 
posts will be set up along Groznyy's perimeter and on the 
approaches to the city. 
  This question was discussed during talks between President 
Dzhokhar Dudayev and representatives of law-enforcement bodies. 
The talks also resulted in the decision to establish 
headquarters for coordinating the newly set-up detachments. The 
headquarters' work will be controlled by the president, who is 
also chairman of the Chechen Security Council.

According to Interfax sources, the party's message to Chechen 
President Dzhokhar Dudayev points to the necessity "to resume 
the dialogue and restore the ruptured links." 
  Without mutual understanding with Chechnya, there will be 
neither peace nor tranquility in the south of Russia. Neither 
can the future of the Chechen people be based on constant 
confrontation with Russia or on isolation from the world 
community, says the message.

  [Text] The congress of Chechen clans does not plan a coup, 
calling instead for democratic elections and better living 
standards, Sherip Khalidov, who is Mayor of Shali, a town 20 km 
from the capital Groznyy, told INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  The Chechen government on Sunday [2 Janaury] banned 
delegates 
of the local clans to hold a congress in Shali designed to 
announce general elections in the republic. Its organizers told 
INTERFAX the forum was annulled in order to avoid violence. The 
council of local clans and ethnic groups says it will announce 
the timing of a new forum within hours before it opens. 
  Khalidov warned against attempts to try to accuse President 
Dzhokhar Dudayev of dictatorial habits and seeking to bring an 
end to democratic reforms. He blamed politicians in the 
President's entourage for playing on some traits of Dudayev's 
character and occasionally offering ill advice. 
  Officials in Groznyy say the congress is illegal because the 
council of local clans was not officially registered. 
Parliamentary Chairman Akhyad Idigov, in an interview with 
INTERFAX, described the forum as a step back and an attempt to 
try to split the Chechens. 
  In the meantime, moderate opposition leaders in the 
recalcitrant Nadterechny region, which refused to be ruled by 
Groznyy in June 1992, have described as unproductive attempts to 
try to call a forum of Chechen clans. It would be much better 
to rally effort in creating a healthy opposition to the 
dictatorial regime in Groznyy instead, they told INTERFAX.

advocated that the interests of the 25 million Russian citizens 
living in the republics of the former Soviet Union be better 
protected. In an interview with AP, Meri claimed in particular 
that: "The words and tone used by Yeltsin could be evidence of 
how weak democratic forces in Russia are. So Russia has chosen 
the path of utilizing the aggressive policy typical of the 
former USSR."

  [Text] As it is known, the government coalition council at 
its session yesterday, did not reach a final agreement on the 
changes of the government's composition. For this, another 
meeting will be held on Thursday [6 January], and in this 
afternoon the coalition deputies will be able to acquaint 
themselves with the candidate ministers and their programs. In 
the words of the Isamaa [Fatherland] deputies, who wish to 
remain anonymous, the reason for the delay was the wish of the 
social democrats and their leader, Marju Lauristin, to listen to 
the program of the candidate finance minister Heiki Kranich. It 
is believed that Kranich will present it tomorrow, said a 
deputy. He was also convinced that the coalition council will 
approve on Thursday all the proposed candidates. The cabinet 
changes must be approved also by President Lennart Meri. 
According to an assertion by the aforementioned Isamaa deputy, 
Lennart Meri may be against the replacement of Minister of the 
Economy Toomas Sildmae. According to unconfirmed reports, Prime 
Minister Mart Laar does not wish to allow a situation to arise 
in which the president would leave some of his proposed 
candidates unendorsed. This might bring with it serious 
constitutional consequences. Today's meeting with the candidate 
ministers was said to have been arranged for gaining time, to 
hold discussions on solving this problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Leonid Levitskiy: "Israel Selling Arms to </F>
Estonia and Supplying Equipment for Its Borders"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- The Estonian Government is taking 
measures to strengthen security along the republic's borders. 
  Electronic devices have already replaced the traditional 
barbed wire in many countries. Estonia also intends to protect 
itself in this way. Italy, Sweden, France, and Israel have 
offered it their electronic systems. The government discussed 
these offers together with the conclusions of experts. As Prime 
Minister Mart Laar announced at a press conference, the only 
scheme for guarding the land border which deserved any attention 
was the one Israel had put forward. It is with Israel that 
negotiations will be held. 
  According to the prime minister, electronic equipment will 
be 
set up along the full length of the border for a certain time. 
But the border with Latvia will in the future become 
unprotected. All equipment from it will be transferred to the 
Estonian-Russian border. 
  Israel has also concluded a contract to supply Estonia with 
arms worth $50 million on credit. There are enough of them for 
the whole Estonian Army.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga January 5 TASS -- Latvia accepted the Russian 
concession that Moscow withdraws its troops from the Baltic 
republic before this September, but hinted it is not going to 
meet in full the Russian demand about keeping the radar in the 
settlement of Skrunda for another six years. 
  The republican government met on Tuesday and accepted the 
Russian proposal made two months ago that the end of August 1994 
should be the deadline for the pullout. 
  Russia which initialy wanted to complete the withdrawal by 
the end of 1994 agreed to speed it up on condition that the 
radar in Skrunda is kept for another six years. 
  Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andreyevs said his country 
is 
advancing a compromise decision on the radar which does not ruin 
the Russian proposal. 
  According to him, the dismantling of one of the units of the 
radar can begin immediately, however, the station will be able 
to continue working. 
  The minister refused to disclose other details saying that 
this compromise will be offered to Russia at the new round of 
talks the date of which had not been determined yet. Initially 
it was scheduled for December 20, but was suspended because of 
Russian elections. 
  He said that many foreign countries are ready to monitor the 
future agreement on the radar station. 
  However, Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis said in a TV 
interview that "no (foreign) country has yet expressed its 
position on the Skrunda (radar)."

  [Text] A delegation of the Danish Ministry of Defense today 
visited the the Russian army unit at Skrunda. Speaking at a 
press briefing at the Ministry of Defense, Danish Defense 
Minister Hans Haekkerup acknowledged that Russia undoubtedly has 
military-strategic interests in Latvia. However, no country has 
the right to maintain its troops in another state against its 
will. 
  At Skrunda the Danish delegation met the leading personnel 
of 
the radar station and listened to a lecture on the activities 
and functions of this station. The guests were not denied a 
chance to examine the station's technical equipment. After that 
the delegation of the Danish Ministry of Defense visited the 
Kuldiga Home Guard battalion. 
  President Guntis Ulmanis also met the Danish minister of 
defense today. Ulmanis noted that this is the first foreign 
delegation to make close acquaintance with the Skrunda radar 
station. The president also appreciatively assessed the 
cooperation agreement signed between the defense forces of 
Latvia and Denmark, and noted that the three main issues in 
talks with Russia directly concern the Skrunda radar station. 
  The Danish defense minister offered the assistance of his 
specialists in ascertaining the harmful effects of the station. 
He was also appreciative of the creation of a unified peace 
battalion for the Baltic countries. Haekkerup and Ulmanis also 
discussed the idea of the common security system for Europe, and 
exchanged views on the NATO summit to be held in January, which 
will also decide on the inclusion of east European countries in 
these structures.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1800 GMT on 4 January broadcasts a 2-minute report by station 
correspondent Valentina Bochkova from Riga on the visit by a 
Danish delegation, headed by Danish Defense Minister Hans 
Haekkerup, to the Russian military base at Skrunda in Latvia. 
Bochkova speaks about the increasing interest in this space 
vehicle tracking station and the fact that the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Latvia depends on the fate of this station. 
She says that this station processes information on 15,000 
space movements every day. It is an automatic tracking station 
serviced by at least 450 people, according to the Russian 
military. The personnel work in complete safety, as neither 
chemical nor radioactive substances are used as sources of 
energy. There have not been any accidents or cases of receiving 
incorrect information since the space observation station 
started operating in the 1960s. The center is one of the links 
in Russia's anti-missile defense system, Bochkova says.

  [Text] RIGA, Jan 04, BNS -- The results of the Russian 
parliament election may lead to "repeated attempts (by Russia) 
to enslave nations (former Soviet republics)," the Latvian 
National Democratic Party said in its Jan. 3 appeal to the world 
governments and community, and in a similar appeal to the 
Latvian people. 
  The documents were provoked by the suprise success of 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic 
Party and communists in the Dec. 12 elections in Russia. 
  The Latvian political elite may start restricting democracy 
in the republic to please Great Russian chauvinists, the 
statement said. 
  The governments of the free world countries should prevent 
"restrictions of human rights and freedoms, and repressions 
against people loyal to the Latvian independence." 
  The statement is distributed to foreign diplomats in Latvia. 
  In the other statement the party urges the Latvian people to 
actively protest opression and totalitarism. 
  Otherwise, Latvia may fall back into the yoke of the Russian 
imperialism, the statement said, because Latvia "still has not 
become part of the free world; it still lacks close links with 
other former Communist bloc countries; and the Latvian economy 
is managed by pro-Russian businessmen." 
  The statement advises Latvians to react on any attempts 
against human rights and freedoms by means of civil resistance, 
like rallies and demonstrations. In case of Russian military 
aggression, the Latvian national defense forces should not obey 
orders to surrender their arms, the statement added. 
  The National Democratic Party also protested its 
classification as a far right wing grouping. It claimed that, if 
so, the majority of European countries and the United States 
should be also viewed as radical rightists.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 04, BNS - Latvian Budget Minister Janis 
Platais presented the parliament's Social and Labor Affairs' 
Committee Tuesday [4 January] with extra information on the 1994 
budget draft. 
  The explanations are needed because of the highly 
complicated 
structure of the budget plan, Platais said. In addition, the 
representation of some spendings in state and local budgets has 
changed, he added. 
  Platais downplayed criticism, voiced Monday by MP [member of 
parliament] Ludmila Kuprijanova, that the government failed to 
budget for the social sphere. 
  The increased pensions are not reflected in the state budget 
because the government ties the increase of pensions with the 
increase of wages in 1994, and the subsequent raise of social 
tax payments, Platais said. 
  The government also does not intend to cut maternity 
allowances, as suggested by Kuprijanova, said Platais, but 
parents of minor children will have choose between an allowance 
or an income tax waiver. 
  The budget plan should be pushed through the parliament soon 
to start funding the projected reforms, the minister concluded.

  [Text] RIGA, Jan 04, BNS -- The 1994 budget draft lacks 
consistency and fails to reflect any economic recovery, said 
Ludmila Kuprijanova, the head of the parliament's Social and 
Labor Affairs Committee. 
  The government's policies target to enlarge the number of 
jobless residents because the budget provides twice more funds 
for unemployment allowances in 1994 than last year, Kuprijanova 
said. The funeral allowances have also increased, she noted. 
  In 1993, both needs required 1.1 million lats, while this 
year the planned sum reached 1.6 million lats, said Kuprijanova. 
  Another chunk of budget resources is earmarked for Latvia's 
membership in international organizations. In 1993, the sum was 
13,000 lats. This year, the allotment soared to 238,000 lats. 
From this, 153,000 lats will go to the World Health Organization 
alone. 
  Kuprijanova questioned the feedback of the Latvian entrance 
into the international structures. 
  In her words, the budget plan is misinterpreted. It should 
be 
submitted to competent institutions for shaping in accordance 
with concrete development mainstreams and programs, like the 
economic development program and the social and medical care 
programs, said Kuprijanova. 
  The health care funds remained unchanged, 38.7 million lats, 
in the prospective budget. The factual assignations also would 
not increase for pensions, social maintenance and maternity 
allowances, Kuprijanova added.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 03, BNS -- Until the end of December 
1993, about 520,000 persons, or approximately a half of the 
citizens of Latvia have obtained new passports of the Latvian 
republic, the deputy head of the visas and passports department 
of the Latvian Interior Ministry, Janis Vidzups, told BNS. 
  At the moment, a total of 1,720,000 citizens have been 
registered in the republic. Meanwhile, the country's population 
amounts to 2,648,000 people, according to the data of 1991. 
  Vidzups said the foreign passports of the former Soviet 
Union 
will be granted to republican citizens in 1994. Only 
non-citizens residing in the republic will be able to obtain 
them. Therefore, Latvian citizens intending to travel abroad 
will have to obtain a passport of the Latvian republic. 
  The work of the visas and passports department is hampered 
by 
the fact that the Latvian parliament has not decided yet on the 
status of foreigners and aliens residing in the republic, 
Vidzups said. 
  As known, until now Latvian citizens acquiring the 
republican 
citizenship for the first time at the age of 16 years old are 
given a passport of the non-existing Soviet Union.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has made an 
official appeal, asking to admit Lithuania to NATO. Speaking on 
Lithuanian television on Tuesday, the president said he had sent 
a letter to Secretary General of NATO Mr. Manfred Woerner, by 
which, taking into account a parliamentary resolution, he had 
officially appealed to admit Lithuania to the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
  In his letter, Mr Algirdas Brazauskas expressed hope that 
the 
NATO summit, due January 10 through 11, would open possibilities 
for the central and east European states to join that 
organization. The president said Lithuania's standpoint toward 
its membership in NATO was not aimed at confrontation with 
either the neighboring countries or any other European state. 
  Lately the right-wing opposition has been criticizing the 
Lithuanian president and the governing Democratic Labor Party 
for too irresolute a position toward Lithuanian membership in 
NATO. 
  Meanwhile, the leader of the right-wing opposition, Mr. 
Vytautas Landsbergis, has expressed hope that the letter of the 
Lithuanian president to the NATO secretary general will attract 
attention in the West. As the opposition leader put it, then 
Lithuania will stand side by side with Poland, not only on the 
map of Europe, but also on the list of candidates for membership 
in NATO. 
  Mr. Landsbergis on Tuesday made a statement falling in line 
with that by the president, that Lithuania is seeking stability 
and protection, and that this, in his words, is not a threat or 
humiliation for anybody. 
  The opposition leader said Lithuania's desire to join NATO 
did not run counter to the U.S. partnership for peace initiative.

<F P=106> ["Regular Tuesday" interview with Prime Minister Adolfas </F>
Slezevicius by unidentified correspondenton 4 January; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] [passage omitted] As prime 
minister and member of the Council for Coordination of Foreign 
Policy at the Presidency of the Republic, what is your comment 
on the importance of the Lithuanian president's letter sent 
yesterday to Manfred Woerner, NATO secretary general? 
  [Slezevicius] I think that the statement made by the 
president yesterday on TV has an exceptional significance and 
meaning. Last year was important to Lithuania in all respects. 
We became a member of the European Council on 14 May and an 
intensive process of integration began into various economic 
structures of Europe, including defense structures. This is a 
long process. In June a decision was adopted in principle by 
the Council of Europe concerning the possibility of us 
concluding a free trade agreement with the European Union, as it 
is now called after the Maastricht Treaty. Therefore, 
yesterday's statement is a logical sequence of all the decisions 
and actions which have taken place previously. 
  Our joint and coordinated position with our Baltic 
neighbors, 
Latvia and Estonia, has been voiced several times. This was 
done at the meeting of the presidents in Riga and Tallinn, at 
the meeting of the prime ministers, and in our declaration 
signed jointly by our minister of national defense and his 
counterparts on 13 September in Tallinn concerning our 
orientation towards NATO defense structures. 
  This act [request to join NATO] is a logical sequence of our 
entire foreign policy. This is especially important at the 
present moment when we are the first former Soviet republic free 
of occupying armed forces. This is of great importance. We are 
now starting a cooperation with the above mentioned European 
structures on a different level. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think we will join NATO soon? 
  [Slezevicius] Indeed some politicians urged us to rush into 
NATO immediately. They believe that this is a very simple 
process. I think that we should not be too optimistic about this 
matter. This is a process, including, as it seems, one of the 
stages -- Partnership for Peace -- which is a new initiative put 
forward by the United States. We are convinced that this would 
be the first important step proceeding towards a new type of 
defense structures. 
  On our part we are conducting very intensive negotiations 
with NATO leadership. Here the visit by Mr Linkevicius 
[minister of defense] and his meeting with Secretary General 
Woerner can be mentioned. A summit of NATO is to held in 
mid-January, following this the president is to visit Brussels. 
This will be the first visit by the head of a foreign country 
aiming at the discussion of all these questions. It is evident 
that our task is to intensify all these processes, which is what 
we are currently consistently doing. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 03, BNS -- "I wish there would be no 
new Yalta" conference this year, said Vytautas Landsbergis, 
leader of the parliament's rightist opposition. 
  At a press conference Monday, Landsbergis said signs of a 
"new Yalta" have appeared and are very threatening to central 
Europe, especially Lithuania. 
  Discussing the problem of NATO membership, the opposition 
leader said a decision to join the alliance is 
"self-determination, and not only for countries in our region, 
but for western countries, as well." 
  Landsbergis said Bulgaria and Macedonia have already 
officially asked for NATO membership and are treated as "the 
last states to have expressed a wish" to join the alliance. He 
expressed hope that Lithuania will be "the last one" and the 
Dec. 23 resolution of the Lithuanian parliament will be taken 
into account. 
  Meanwhile, the Lithuanian administration simply awaits the 
Jan. 10 NATO summit, the opposition leader said. He reminded 
reporters that Lithuanian authorities still have several days 
left to make their move. 
  Landsbergis said he is deeply concerned about a New Year's 
speech by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who vowed to better 
defend the interests of Russians living in the former Soviet 
republics. The opposition leader pointed out Yeltsin's words 
that Russia will have difficulty in preserving peace and that 
Russia will defend its own interests, as well as the interests 
of its citizens in other countries.

  [Text] Vilnius, Dec 29, BNS -- No matter which government 
is in office, Lithuania will fare even better one year from now, 
Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said in an interview with the 
LETUVOS RYTAS newspaper on Tuesday. 
  Slezevicius, the country's sixth head of government since it 
won independence in 1990, says Lithuania is well past the worst 
stage of economic recession, raising the hope for an increased 
flow of foreign investment in 1994. He said talks were under 
way for as many as five credit lines with the World Bank alone. 
  The prime minister forecast that next year's inflation will 
be lower than an increase in incomes and pensions because of 
appropriate groundwork being laid down in the past six months 
which he called "a very difficult period indeed." Slezevicius 
said when the government arrived in office nine months ago, it 
inherited a combined debt of USD 71 Mln [$71 million] for 
imports of gas and nuclear fuel. The problem has now been 
resolved, he said. The monthly 25 percent rate of inflation has 
now been kept down to less than that for one quarter of the 
year, he said. 
  The prime minister said the opposition does not appear to be 
happy about the signs of stabilization. Slezevicius spoke of 
farmers threatening a general strike since August and a series 
of sporadic rallies and pickets which he described as 
politically-motivated actions aimed at unsettling the situation. 
And he added that the Conservatives did not conceal their 
wanting to overthrow the government. However, the social basis 
for strikes is diminishing, Slezevicius said. 
  The prime minister warned against attempts to try to rock 
the 
boat, saying the government would go ahead with its policy of 
liberalizing the economy, steadying the currency, and resolving 
social issues.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 04, BNS -- The principal aim of the 
Russian company Lucoil, the chief supplier of oil to Lithuania, 
is "to increase prices and to rob people" without even having to 
compete, said Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian 
parliament's rightist opposition. 
  The continuing story of Lithuanian oil terminal construction 
proves that Lithuania's energy system is still dependent on 
other countries, he said. 
  Landsbergis said energy prices in Estonia are going down 
because it imports fuel from the West, while Lithuania makes up 
the "Lucoil myth" to justify the absence of alternative fuel 
sources.

foreign countries by Lithuanian top government officials and 
future visits to Lithuania by officials and leaders of foreign 
countries. 
  Brazauskas is to make a statement on today's Lithuanian TV

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 03, BNS - Efficient work of state 
institutions, legal reforms, privatization and foreign 
investments dominated Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas' 
regular Monday [3 January] night radio spot this week. 
  Discussing privatization, the president said it suffers from 
disorder and abuse of authority by officials. The first stage of 
the process, hopefully to be completed this year, was very 
successful, Brazauskas said. He urged the government to 
carefully prepare a legal basis and a program for the next stage 
of state property privatization. 
  The president said the previous year was quite successful 
because economic stabilization was achieved and foreign trade 
became much livelier. Brazauskas said the principal task this 
year will be to sign a free trade agreement with the European 
Union. 
  He noted, however, that "very serious conclusions need to be 
drawn" in stimulating foreign investments and attracting foreign 
banks to Lithuania. A new law on banks should be adopted as soon 
as possible, he said. 
  "I think commercial banks should not be treated so 
skeptically." In his opinion, the central bank should actively 
cooperate with commercial banks and other private structures, in 
order to boost the circulation of capital and to increase credit 
resources. 
  The president said a number of serious problems remain in 
industry and agriculture. Brazauskas expressed hope that 
production will finally begin to grow this year.

  [Text] Before the New Year, Professor Jan Widacki, Polish 
ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lithuania, 
invited journalists to a press conference in which he tried to 
dispel the myths about the allegedly unfriendly relations 
between the Lithuanians and the Poles. According to the 
ambassador, these myths are spread by some politicians and 
reporters. 
  One of those myths is the opinion expressed in the 
Lithuanian 
press that Poland either had or has such political and social 
groups that raise territorial claims to Lithuania. 
  The ambassador assured that this is not the case, and that 
the Polish Government recognizes Lithuania's territorial status 
quo. 
  Jan Widacki also expressed his surprise with the statements 
that some "third party" is behind the issue of the registration 
of the Home Army veterans' club in Lithuania. He ruled out the 
proposal examined in the Lithuanian press that this club be 
registered at some Lithuanian veterans' organization or function 
within the framework of the Poles' Union. 
  To reduce such misunderstandings, the ambassador proposed 
that journalists of both countries meet for seminars at least 
twice a year. 
  In Jan Widacki's opinion, the journalists' duty is to dispel 
myths which emerged in relations between the Lithuanian and 
Polish nations rather than on the interstate level.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 04, BNS -- The Ignalina nuclear power 
plant, Lithuania's chief electricity producer, shut down New 
Year's eve one out of two turbines of the first nuclear reactor, 
the RESPUBLIKA newspaper said. 
  The stoppage reportedly resulted from a crack in the 
turbine's pipe system. Repairs will presumably be completed Jan. 
10. The reactor will continue to operate with one turbine until 
then. 
  Experts said the shut down of one turbine will not have any 
noticeable effect on the country's energy system.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 04, BNS -- Lithuanian Energy Minister 
Algimantas Stasiukynas claimed the opposition's demands for him 
to resign are simply "yet another political attack." 
  In December, the parliament's rightist opposition demanded 
to 
take a vote of confidence in the minister for allowing to burn 
toxic fuel in boiler houses of several Lithuanian towns and 
regions. As a result, a number of people suffered from 
gas-poisoning, the opposition said. 
  In a statement released Monday [3 January], Stasiukynas said 
state-run and commercial structures have the right to import and 
to sell oil and oil products in Lithuania in accordance with the 
Aug. 31, 1992 government resolution. The resolution allows all 
enterprises within the jurisdiction of the Energy Ministry to 
purchase oil products without any special permissions. 
  Absorbent-1, a toxic fuel used in some areas, was purchased 
by the state-run Siluma (Heat) company from the joint 
Lithuania-USA company Lamaringas. 
  According to the established order, oil products can be 
imported into Lithuania only if their import is officially 
permitted, or if a special permission is issued by the 
Environmental Protection Department. The minister said 
Lamaringas imported the toxic fuel unlawfully and is fully 
responsible for its realization in Lithuania. The minister said 
the case has been handed over to the prosecutor's office.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 03, BNS - The board of the Lithuanian 
Sajudis categorically denied its involvement in collecting 
signatures under a demand to hold a referendum on early 
parliamentary elections in Lithuania. 
  Parliament Chairman Juozas Bernatonis said Monday [3 
January] 
"it is rumored that Sajudis members collect signatures on blank 
sheets of paper." 
  In a statement circulated Monday, the executive secretary of 
Sajudis, Jurgis Razma, said the organization's board never even 
discussed a possibility to start collecting signatures for a 
referendum. Razma said regional branches of Sajudis have not 
been authorized to deal with the matter either.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 04, BNS - A meeting between Boris 
Pastukhov, a Russian deputy foreign minister, and his Lithuanian 
counterpart Albinas Januska took place Tuesday [4 January] in 
Moscow, the press service of the Lithuanian Embassy in Moscow 
told BNS. 
  The ministers discussed Lithuania's rights to buildings of 
diplomatic missions in Paris, Rome and Moscow. The buildings 
belonged to Lithuania before 1940, but after Lithuania's 
annexation by the Soviet Union they passed into the hands of 
some Soviet organizations. The Lithuanian embassy building in 
Paris was taken over by the APN news agency, and the Soviet 
embassy in Italy moved into the building of the Lithuanian 
embassy in Rome. Lithuania insists on the return of the 
buildings. 
  The meeting also touched on the question of rooms of the 
Russian diplomatic mission in Vilnius. It is currently located 
in an old administrative building, which the Russian diplomats 
claim to be unsuitable for their work. The situation is 
complicated because Vilnius did not belong to Lithuania until 
the country's occupation by the Soviet Union, and so no Soviet 
embassy existed there. 
  This was the first time the foreign ministries of the two 
countries discussed the problem of the Lithuanian embassies in 
Moscow, Paris and Rome and the Russian embassy in Vilnius in 
their complexity. The Russian side previously refused to 
consider restoration of the buildings in Paris and Rome to 
Lithuania. 
  The meeting was "constructive and positive," stated the 
official press release of the Lithuanian Embassy in Moscow. "The 
parties will draw their final conclusions during future 
meetings," the officials said. 
  After the talks with Pastukhov, Januska met with Sergey 
Krylov, a Russian deputy foreign minister, to discuss the 
relations between Lithuania and Russia, particularly the 
problems related to the Russian Kaliningrad enclave.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Eastern Europe Awaits Bill </F>
Clinton and Asks for NATO Membership"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Eastern Europe is calling for 
amendments to the Partnership for Peace program. At present 
opposition to this is not so tough, but, as an American diplomat 
put it, "if the East Europeans do not believe in partnership, it 
loses all point." 
  Official State Department representatives have said that all 
diplomatic channels are being used on both sides of the ocean to 
ensure that no doubts linger: If the East Europeans reject 
partnership, it will not be to their benefit. 
  However, today these arguments no longer work as they did 
prior to the recent parliamentary elections in Russia. When the 
charms of gradualism are praised in Warsaw or Prague, only one 
word is heard in response: Zhirinovskiy. 
  Even Boris Yeltsin's offer of security guarantees, which 
Russia, along with NATO, is ready to give its former Warsaw Pact 
allies, is viewed in Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest in the light 
of 50 years of inequality. The Russian president's offer is 
presented as the latest piece of evidence: Look, our suspicions 
are not without foundation, Russia still considers itself the 
arbiter of its former satellites' fate. 
  Of course no serious politician is entitled to ignore the 
staying power of Russian imperialism, as demonstrated by the 
vote for Zhirinovskiy. However, U.S. officials are coming 
increasingly to the conclusion that "recent expressions of 
regret over the results of the Russian elections are being 
voiced by the East Europeans to create as persuasive a case as 
possible for eventual NATO membership." 
  However, this stance by the U.S. Administration is coming 
under criticism. Both the leaders of the Czech Republic, 
Poland, and Hungary and the representatives of the political 
opposition in those countries are asking for the criteria of 
NATO membership to be elaborated as a matter of urgency. 
  The opinion is spreading among observers that U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher is coming around to the standpoint 
actively prmoted by Czech President Vaclav Havel: Namely that, 
while there is no need to revise Partnership for Peace at 
present, the terms which will open the organization's doors to 
Eastern Europe should be enshrined in a document at the upcoming 
meeting of heads of state and government in Brussels. 
  However, the position of Strobe Talbott, recently special 
envoy for former Soviet Union affairs and now second in command 
at the U.S. State Department, remains immutable and firm: There 
are no new demarcation lines in Europe. Staffers close to 
Talbott maintain that in deliberately exaggerating the 
significance of the pro-Zhirinovskiy vote the East Europeans are 
pursuing perfectly natural aims: Full NATO membership means 
belonging to the Western world, which brings with it not so much 
security guarantees, the need for which is highly illusory, so 
much as entry to Western markets and an inflow of investments. 
  The question to which American diplomacy has not yet 
formulated a definitive answer for itself probably goes as 
follows: Is democracy in Russia capable of curbing the 
onslaught of imperialist, chauvinist tendencies and preventing 
the state being run by radicals like Zhirinovskiy?

  According to our information, GMM will take action against 
Mikhail Leontyev and the newspaper SEGODNYA tomorrow. At this 
stage the firm plans to hold a series of consultations with the 
Central Bank, which has suspended GMM operations. Mr. 
Shakhovtsov, head of the Central Bank banking supervision 
section, has said that in the absence of legislation on trust 
companies, the operation of GMM pertains equally to that of a 
trust and of a banking company. 
  In Zhirinovskiy's headquarters, it was said to our request 
for comments on the situation that the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia absolutely did not care about GMM's problems, and that 
the party was busy devising plans to destroy Germany, which had 
refused its leader an entry visa.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Vitaliy Churkin, President </F>
Yeltsin's personal envoy for issues concerning the former 
Yugoslavia, by Bogoljub Lacmanovic in Moscow on 27 December: 
"Realist Autonomy for the Serbs"] 
  [Text] "If the present peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is not signed on 15 January in Geneva -- that is, by the end of 
January 1994 -- the consequences for all parties to the conflict 
will be disastrous," Vitaliy Churkin, President Yeltsin's 
personal envoy for issues concerning former Yugoslavia, told me 
during our one-hour interview. Surprised, I gave him a long, 
sharp look, trying to decide whether behind this "dark forecast" 
there only lay an attempt to place more pressure on the parties 
to sign the peace agreement through a public message in the 
papers. 
  Churkin caught the look and continued: "No, no. I am sure 
that the present peace plan cannot hold forever without being 
signed, especially since the plan contains resolutions to 99 
percent of the disputed issues, and there is tension about 
whether the plan will be signed. I will allow a term of two 
months at the most, but if the plan is not signed by then, I 
believe that the peace plan will fail, as will all the positive 
achievements related to it. Then, when the snow begins to melt, 
all the conflicting sides will take their gloves off and start 
fighting with their bare hands. In short, what could not be 
solved at the negotiating table will be solved on the 
battlefield. Consequences will be terrible not only for Bosnia 
and the entire former Yugoslavia, but for Europe as well. It 
will then be difficult to stop the war, Europe will be faced 
with a new wave of refugees, and the burden of humanitarian aid 
will also increase. However, we are doing this interview for 
the new year's edition of your paper, so let us be optimistic. 
I also hope that reason will prevail and that the conflicting 
sides will sign the peace agreement in Geneva on 15 January." 
  I interviewed Vitaliy Churkin on 27 December in his office 
of 
first deputy foreign minister of Russia on the seventh floor of 
the high rise at the Smolenskaya Square in Moscow, built 
immediately after World War II. Only two days had passed since 
Churkin's return from the peace talks in Geneva and Brussels, 
and he was still under the impression of their unsuccessful 
ending, although the peace plan was "very close" to being 
signed. I first asked him if a positive move had been made 
after all toward resolving the crisis in Bosnia and the former 
Yugoslavia. He replied: 
  [Churkin] A positive move has been made, but I have the 
feeling that we have again come to the point at which things can 
be stalled and negotiations continued, but an end to the 
negotiations cannot be seen. If 99 percent of the contentious 
issues have therefore been agreed upon and if there is a desire 
for peace, I see no reason for not signing the peace plan. 
  [Lacmanovic] Vitaliy Ivanovich, does that mean that you also 
believe that the Croat and Serb sides have granted enough 
concessions to the Muslims? 
  [Churkin] It seems that the Muslims have not accepted the 
agreement and the formula that the European Union has proposed 
for their access -- that is, exit -- to the Adriatic Sea. In 
Geneva, Presidents Tudjman and Milosevic agreed upon the 
parameters important for the agreement: 17.5 percent of the 
territory to the Croats, 33.3 percent to the Muslims, and 49.2 
percent to the Serbs, while the Serbs and the Muslims still have 
to agree upon the details on the map. In my opinion, it was 
possible to sign the peace agreement in Brussels on the basis of 
the formula proposed by Presidents Tudjman and Milosevic, and 
the negotiations on disputed details should have been continued. 
This mechanism of finishing the peace plan is contained in the 
document that all three sides initialed this fall on the British 
aircraft carrier near Split. That was the reason I, as an 
observer, asked for permission to speak at the meeting in 
Brussels and suggested to the conflicting sides that they sign 
the peace agreement immediately and then continue the 
negotiations on the disputable or unresolved issues. 
  [Lacmanovic] The Muslims have obviously turned their back on 
your proposal. 
  [Churkin] In Brussels, I was amazed to see that this side 
first rejected the plan proposed by the European Union and then 
dared to say: Since this plan is not acceptable, let us seek 
and elaborate on another variant. A thousand and one variants 
of, for instance, an exit to the sea can be made. Channels, 
tunnels, or new roads to the sea can be constructed, but I am 
now asking where the guarantees are that this thousand and one 
variant will then be accepted. 
  This is why I proposed in Brussels that in case any of the 
conflicting sides (which need not be the Serb one) blocks the 
peace process, the conditions of suspending the sanctions be 
elaborated to the minutest detail and that there be no waiting 
for the final signing of the peace agreement. I would like to 
stress that this is a matter of precisely arranged conditions 
for lifting the sanctions. It is my opinion that our proposal is 
also in the interest of Croatia and that Zagreb should 
understand it correctly and accept it. I believe that this 
proposal concerning the sanctions suits all the conflicting 
sides in Bosnia, where I also include the Muslims, whose aim it 
is that the agreement be reached and that the peace plan be 
signed. 
  [Lacmanovic] You have said that the signing of the agreement 
in Brussels was "very close." Exactly what was it that remained 
disputed? 
  [Churkin] Apart from the access to the sea for the Muslims, 
they also claim that the offered access at Prevlaka would 
require the construction of a road that would be too expensive, 
and there are also some disputed issues concerning Mostar, while 
between the Muslims and Serbs, there are some disputed details 
concerning Sarajevo and the widening of their access to the Sava 
River. 
  [Lacmanovic] Vitaliy Ivanovich, do you believe that 
Croatia could really offer the Muslims some better access or 
exit to the sea than what President Tudjman has offered now in 
Geneva, without this concession being quite unacceptable to the 
interests of the Croatian state? 
  [Churkin] It is hard for me to judge. This is an extremely 
difficult and complex issue. I did not dwell on it too much, 
distancing myself from the position of the European Union. It 
seemed to me that the first variant, which was elaborated on the 
British aircraft carrier, satisfied everyone. It turned out 
later that I was wrong. I have the impression that this problem 
is not being considered with due attention. I repeat: If there 
is a sincere desire to reach an agreement, then there is no 
reason not to sign it. How the ships will sail and similar 
issues are technical details. It seems that everything is being 
made to go in circles. 
  [Lacmanovic] An increasing number of unbiased analysts and 
commentators have concluded that the Muslim leadership presents 
new demands at each new meeting in order to make the 
negotiations more difficult, when behind all this lies their 
rejection of the plan on the territorial division and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three peoples. While you were 
attending the negotiations in Brussels, the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
ambassador in Russia told Moscow TV that Bosnia was indivisible 
and that it should remain an integral state. 
  [Churkin] Everyone knows that among the Muslims, there are 
people who do not like the present peace plan and who are 
persistently trying to create the illusion that there is no 
conflict in the Bosnian war -- that is, that there is no 
conflict of interests. They think it is possible to "roll back" 
the present situation in Bosnia to the beginning. This is not 
possible, and if we were to concentrate on these people, the war 
in Bosnia would continue forever. 
  I believe that the tragedy of the Muslims is being made 
worse 
by the fact that they are trying to extend the war. They think 
that in this way, they will reach their goal -- a united Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. However, they are neglecting the fact that the 
longer the war lasts, the further their ideals are from reality. 
The continuation of war raises new barriers among the people. 
The sooner the war is ended, the more chance there will be of 
strengthening the relations that connect and unite the Muslims, 
Serbs, and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Lacmanovic] Some analysts explain the present Muslim 
actions at the negotiations by the alleged support of the United 
States. Even Lord Owen, after the unsuccessful negotiations in 
Brussels, blamed Washington for the "idealist" approach to the 
problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Churkin] I have not seen this statement and will, 
therefore, not comment on it. However, since you have asked an 
extremely important question, I will answer it, although not 
directly because of my diplomatic role in the entire conflict. 
  First, I would like to emphasize that the culprits for the 
conflict should not be sought outside but within the entire 
former Yugoslavia. All the conflicting sides are to blame and 
not someone else or someone besides them, especially since so 
much blood has been spilled. Naturally, external factors also 
play a role in that conflict. I personally believe that the 
peace agreement has not been signed in Brussels because the 
international community was not decisive enough for the task it 
was faced with: to bring the job to the end. To put an end to 
the endless meetings and negotiations, it would take the 
decisiveness of the European Union, Russia, and the United 
States. If the other international forces had been as 
determined in Brussels as Russia was, the peace agreement would 
have been signed there. The Russian position is that, because 
of the danger that the conflict in Bosnia brings, the peace plan 
should be signed immediately. If not today, then tomorrow. 
  [Lacmanovic] At the meeting in Brussels, you presented some 
proposals regarding the solving of Croat-Serb relations. 
  [Churkin] Yes, I welcomed the progress achieved in the 
negotiations between Presidents Tudjman and Milosevic a day 
earlier and asked both sides to immediately start working on the 
formula for the mutual recognition of the FRY and Croatia and on 
establishing diplomatic relations, which would ultimately result 
in solving and determining the final political status of the 
Croatian territory with the Serb majority. Our plan has several 
stages: the first is reaching an agreement on ending armed 
conflicts, and then the two sides establishing the first degree 
of economic relations (for the start, opening the traffic on the 
Belgrade-Zagreb road). What could follow is the mutual 
recognition of the two states and the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between Belgrade and Zagreb, which would 
facilitate a constant dialogue, and, most importantly, all this 
would open the door to the last and most important stage, which 
is the resolving of the fundamental problem -- that is, the 
political status of the Krajina. 
  I would like to point out that when I talked to President 
Tudjman about this sequence and plan for resolving the 
Croat-Serb relations, I did not have the impression that he was 
not accepting it. Therefore, this idea should now be elaborated 
upon. 
  [Lacmanovic] However, Milosevic and the Serb leadership have 
not agreed to the diplomatic recognition of Croatia because they 
do not want to or think that this way they can dispute the 
Croatian state borders. 
  [Churkin] The Serb leaders did not tell me their reasons, 
but I also think that this is the issue and that they do not 
want to separately consider the situation in the Croatian areas 
with a Serb majority called the Krajina. In the present 
situation, when there are only attempts to negotiate a 
cease-fire in Croatia and the establishment of the first 
economic relations, it is unrealistic to expect that Belgrade 
will start working on the diplomatic recognition of Croatia. 
However, from a diplomatic point of view, it would be good (and 
it is possible) to find a way that would, for instance, allow 
for appointing ambassadors. The most important thing now is to 
find a viable formula that would open the door to the final goal 
-- determining the political status of the Croatian areas with a 
Serb majority. 
  [Lacmanovic] Does this viable formula imply the creation of 
a "state within a state" -- that is, the establishment of 
Croatia as a federation? 
  [Churkin] You must be referring to the interview I gave to 
one of the Zagreb papers last summer. The correspondent asked 
me questions insisting on various formulations, to which I 
responded. It is up to the correspondent and the papers to 
interpret the conversation in a certain way and in a certain 
context, but I was not talking about a federation and a state 
within a state. My position was, and is now, that the Serbs in 
that area in Croatia should be given realist autonomy. It is up 
to the two sides to agree upon what the form of this autonomy 
will be and what it will be called. Therefore, what matters is 
content and not the formal title. 
  [Lacmanovic] Croatia has already made the greatest possible 
step in that direction. This fall, President Tudjman proposed 
autonomy for two Serb districts in his peace initiative. 
  [Churkin] I consider President Tudjman's first step 
extremely important and positive. The most important thing is 
that the two sides now start a process of negotiation based on 
this peace initiative. To be honest, I do not think that 
President Tudjman's positive proposal will remain his last step 
in seeking the solution to the problem. It will take a lot more 
effort before the political status of this region in Croatia is 
solved. 
  [Lacmanovic] Is that the reason you practically started the 
initiative to implement the "modus vivendi" formula, which the 
European Union proposed for the Croatian territories controlled 
by rebel Serbs? 
  [Churkin] A good idea or a plan usually has many authors. I 
would like to remind you that this summer, I managed to organize 
a meeting of the representatives of Croatian authorities and the 
Knin Serbs in Topusko, at which the negotiations on a cease-fire 
and establishing economic relations were first started. 
  [Lacmanovic] Does your initiative in Brussels mean that the 
Russian side believes the Croat-Serb contradictions can be 
solved without untying the Bosnian knot first? 
  [Churkin] Why not? It would be useful. The latest meeting 
of Presidents Tudjman and Milosevic in Geneva has shown that 
this is also possible. 
  [Lacmanovic] Croatia is convinced that a peaceful agreement 
with the Serbs is not possible if the sanctions against 
Belgrade, which supports and encourages the separatism of the 
Knin Serbs, are lifted. However, Russia persistently supports 
the lifting of the sanctions against Serbia. 
  [Churkin] First, the sanctions are not only damaging Serbia 
but the entire geopolitical region around it, and it is 
impossible to keep the sanctions in effect forever. Second, the 
sanctions were introduced as an instrument that should lead to a 
peaceful agreement on Bosnia. It would be unrealistic to expect 
that this agreement can be reached without having informed the 
Serbs of the exact conditions for lifting the sanctions. 
  I know that the Croat side would like the lifting of the 
sanctions to be directly connected to the solving of the problem 
of its territory controlled by the Serbs. The Russian position 
on this issue is strictly a matter of principle. As a member of 
the Security Council, Russia's position is that this body should 
act in a legalist way. In this specific case, this means: The 
sanctions against Serbia were introduced because of the 
situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and if this conflict is 
solved, the sanctions should be lifted. During the negotiations 
on the British aircraft carrier, the three conflicting sides 
agreed upon the conditions for lifting the sanctions. According 
to the final account, the solving of the Bosnian problem will 
pave the way to the gradual normalization of the Croat-Serb 
contradictions, and this is precisely why I would like to ask 
the Croat side to consider the problem of the sanctions in its 
complexity. 
  [Lacmanovic] Vitaliy Ivanovich, I am certain that you are 
aware of the fact that you and your statements are frequently a 
target of severe criticism in the Croatian press. 
  [Churkin] I am not only attacked in Croatia. I am attacked 
by the Serb and Muslim side, too. This is not surprising. In a 
way, I am proud of it, as it confirms my belief that I am 
carrying out my diplomatic tasks objectively. I have no 
anti-Croat, anti-Serb, or anti-Muslim tendencies. I have 
visited nearly all the areas of conflict, and I know how 
difficult it is to determine who is the angel and who is the 
devil. 
  This year, I have spent 190 days traveling, and the vast 
majority of these trips was connected to seeking peace for the 
territories of the former Yugoslavia. I spent at least 300 
hours on a plane. That is two weeks. I visited Zagreb five 
times this year. 
  I still claim that Russian policies are very balanced in 
relation to all the sides of the former Yugoslavia. During my 
visit to Croatia, I discovered that the people were very 
friendly to me. Russian-Croatian state relations are good, and 
all the conditions for strengthening the economic relations 
between our countries exist.

  [Text] We have just received a statement of the Foreign 
Ministry of the Russian Federation, which states: The 
leadership of the Russian Federation has received with profound 
grief and indignation the report of the brutal murders carried 
out in recent days in Tajikistan of Russian-speaking citizens -- 
a deacon of the Orthodox Church, a whole family including five 
children, and a young woman resident of Dushanbe. We are firmly 
relying on the fact that the Tajikistan authorities will take 
the most energetic measures in investigating what has happened 
and in speedily identifying and suitably punishing the 
murderers. We also expect that the Government of Tajikistan 
will do everything necessary to ensure the security and the 
protection of the rights and dignity of the Russian-speaking 
citizens of the republic.

  [Text] Sochi January 5 TASS -- A Russian Foreign Ministry 
delegation with Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov at its 
head flew into the Adler Airport of Sochi today. The delegation 
includes Valeriy Shuykov, head of the Russian part of the 
Abkhazia settlement united commission. 
  "We plan to visit several areas of Abkhazia, including the 
Galski and Sukhumi, hold talks with the republic's leadership 
and meet public representatives," Boris Pastukhov told 
journalists at the Sochi airport. Pastukhov noted that the 
second round of the Georgian-Abkhazian talks is scheduled to 
open in Geneva on January 11 which are to be held under the 
auspices of the United Nations and active participation of 
Russia. Members of the Russian delegation have recently visited 
Tbilisi with the aim of preparating for these talks. They held 
a number of meetings with the Georgian leadership. "Russia, as 
before, intends to fulfil its mission, seeking a full political 
settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict," Pastukhov 
emphahsised. 
  Replying to a question regarding the abolishment of economic 
sanctions against Abkhazia, Boris Pastukhov told ITAR-TASS that 
assertions regarding the abolishment of economic sanctions do 
not conform to reality. But at the same time, understanding the 
serious state of affairs in which the peaceful population is 
living in the zone of conflict, the Russian leadership is taking 
a number of measures which will help ease sanctions. For 
example, plans for supplying foodstuffs and fuels. 
  The Russian delegation plans to return to Moscow on 
Thursday.

<F P=106> [Igor Rotar report under the "Conflict" rubric: "Economic </F>
Blockade of Abkhazia Has Been Lifted. Men in Tbilisi Abstain 
From Comment"] 
  [Text] Russia has ended its economic blockade of Abkhazia. 
As has been explained to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent 
at the Russian Foreign Ministry CIS Department, Moscow's 
decision is the result of the following considerations: The 
leaders of Abkhazia have been of late demonstrating their 
readiness for a dialogue with Tbilisi and taking specific steps 
toward a peaceful settlement of the situation in the conflict 
zone. Besides, it is primarily civilians, including Russians, 
who are suffering from the blockade. In the opinion of Russian 
diplomats, the lifting of the blockade shortly before the new 
year will be assessed as Moscow's goodwill gesture and will 
contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region. 
  From the point of view of Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba, 
Russia's blockade of Abkhazia contravened the Geneva agreement 
signed by Moscow. (One of the items in the document says: "The 
sides appeal to the international community for assistance in 
restoring the life-support systems in the zone of conflict....") 
  The problem, however, has a reverse side too. Russia, as a 
guarantor of the Sochi agreement, is responsible for any 
violation of the understandings by the Abkhaz side. 
Significantly, in his interview for your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent, Andrey Kozyrev did not deny facts attesting to 
Russian Army help to the Abkhaz people. The blockade of 
Abkhazia demonstrated to the world community, albeit not too 
convincingly, that Moscow condemned the violators of the Sochi 
agreement. The lifting of the blockade in effect consolidates 
the victory for Abkhaz military formations and, as a 
consequence, will lead to even an greater anti-Russian mood in 
Georgia. True, at this stage, as your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent was told at the Georgian Embassy, Tbilisi 
officials refrain from assessing the event. 
  Also rather interesting is the fact that Moscow has made up 
its mind to lift the blockade despite the fact that there was 
after all no real progress in the settlement of the Abkhaz 
crisis. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already reported (21 December 
1993) that the problem of refugees from Abkhazia had been the 
main stumbling block in the talks between Tbilisi and Gudauta: 
the Abkhaz side insists that the republic's status be 
determined in a referendum. Today, as an overwhelming majority 
of Georgians have left Abkhazia, a referendum, according to 
Tbilisi, will not be legitimate. As Vladislav Ardzinba stated 
in an interview with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, the 
republic's leaders today cannot guarantee the safety of Georgian 
refugees who would like to return, hence the question of the 
republic's status is being shelved once again. Also, your 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, who has just returned from 
Abkhazia, can testify that the remaining Georgian population in 
the republic is continuing to be plundered. 
  Moscow's position would have been explicable had it rejected 
the blockade idea right away on the grounds that it was 
unwilling to punish innocent civilians. As for Moscow's present 
decision, there may be only two explanations: Either Russia has 
realized it made yet another mistake, or the decision to 
institute economic sanctions had been no more than a trick aimed 
at pacifying the world community.

  [Text] A closed meeting of Russian and Armenian delegations 
headed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his 
Armenian counterpart, Grant Bagratyan, was held in the 
government building on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment today. 
  Armenian Ambassador to Russia Feliks Mamikoniyan, who also 
took part in the negotiations, told Interfax that the meeting 
focused on a package of agreements which had been meant to be 
agreed on rather than signed. "As a result, the differences 
between the Russian and Armenian sides were settled," the 
diplomat pointed out. Mamikoniyan stressed that "Armenia did not 
take the role of an supplicant; it was a tough, but good-natured 
talk between two partners, each with its own capabilities." 
  Commenting on the draft bilateral trade and economic 
agreement for 1994, Mamikoniyan said "a mechanism for settling 
differences was found." The ambassador added that the 
differences were over Yerevan's settlements of payments for 
Russian clearing deliveries of goods. He said "Armenia has 
funds to pay, but the country finds itself in a transportation 
blockade." 
  According to Mamikoniyan, the Russian prime minister spoke 
against the proposal by the Russian concern "Roskontrakt" to 
transform Armenia's debt for Russian oil worth 40 billion rubles 
into Russia's state debt and enable this commercial organization 
to independently look for ways to settle the payments issue with 
its partners. 
  Mamikoniyan said the Russian side treated with understanding 
the request to grant a humanitarian credit worth 10 billion 
rubles to Armenia to enable it to reconstruct the facilities in 
the area hit by an earthquake in December 1998. The meeting 
also discussed granting 23 out of 40 billion rubles of the 
Russian state credit to Armenia in 1993 that have never been 
used. 
  According to Mamikoniyan, Yerevan proposed setting up a 
joint 
venture with Russia to exploit the Armenian nuclear power 
station which is now under reconditioning and prepared for 
launch. The two sides agreed to prepare a draft 
intergovernmental agreement on the issue.

  [Text] New York, 4 Jan -- During his upcoming visit to 
Moscow U.S. President Bill Clinton intends to sign documents 
making it incumbent on the U.S. Government overseas private 
investment corporation to grant credit guarantees and insurance 
against political risk to the "Packard" and "Caterpillar" 
companies. 
  "Packard" and "Caterpillar" recently announced their wish to 
participate on a joint basis with the Russian ZIL production 
association to create new heavy trucks. The documents which are 
planned to be signed during the summit meeting are to ensure the 
start of the successful functioning of a new joint venture, 
"AMOZIL," and safeguard U.S. entrepreneurs against financial 
losses. 
  An official spokesman for the overseas private investment 
corporation stressed that U.S. President B. Clinton and Vice 
President A. Gore very much want to see this venture succeed, 
since they believe that the development of transportation is a 
key element in Russian economic recovery. He also noted that 
the plan provides not only for the construction of a new truck 
plant near Moscow, but also for the creation of a network of 
stores and truck maintenance centers. 
  According to the leaders of the U.S. companies, truck 
production is planned to start at the end of next year. 
According to the agreement concluded between ZIL, "Packard," 
and "Caterpillar," the U.S. partners will produce chassis and 
engines and the Russian plant will produce bodies for the heavy 
truck.

<F P=106> [Vadim Belykh report: "Four Hundred Years in Jail for </F>
Defrauding `Rosugol'"] 
  [Text] A federal court in Oklahoma has found the American 
lawyer David Branson guilty of defrauding the Russian Government 
to the tune of $1.3 million. The fraudster, convicted on 50 
counts, faces a 400-year jail sentence. 
<H5>  The Bricklayer Lawyer </H5>
  In our country the best of intentions usually end in major 
scandals, court cases, and monstrous losses. But the "Ugol 
Rossii" Corporation (successor to the "Rosugol" state company) 
could hardly have imagined in its worst nightmare that its quite 
innocent desire to have two brick plants in Moscow Oblast's 
Serebryanoprudskiy Rayon would suddenly be transformed into a 
court case in what was, for it, the hitherto unknown Oklahoma 
City and that it would have to appear as the injured party. 
  The idea was indeed to build these ill-starred plants to 
help 
miners in the Arctic who had been pensioned off. Arriving in 
warm Serebryanyye Prudy from the cold north, they would get a 
job at these plants and then receive housing built from bricks 
made with their own hands. It was decided to buy all the 
necessary equipment abroad. The tenders from major European and 
American firms were rejected at the outset as too expensive. 
Then the Oklahoma lawyer David Branson popped up from out of 
the blue. 
  It is still a mystery as to who put the fraudster lawyer in 
touch with the "Ugol Rossii" leadership and how he was able to 
captivate the management. After all, until that time Branson 
had, by all accounts, only a rather vague idea about the brick 
manufacturing process, and his firm -- Consolidated Service 
Corporation, which, according to him, had received the 
prestigious "E" award from the U.S. Department of Commerce -- 
was only registered after signing the contract with our Russian 
businessmen. 
  On the other hand, the lawyer promised to build the two 
brick 
plants in Serebryanoprudskiy Rayon for just $4.395 billion [as 
published]. In order to appear more convincing, he organized 
several trips for "Rosugol" representatives to the United States 
and South Africa, where, in an atmosphere of easygoing service, 
he took the tourists to visit other firms' plants producing 
brickmaking equipment, and passed them off as his own. The 
Russian officials' hearts melted, the contract was signed, and 
Branson was paid $1.3 million as an advance against future 
deliveries. The owner of Consolidated Service Corporation did 
not need any particular creativity to spend of the money. He 
vacationed in Hawaii and bought a fully furnished house and nine 
collector's-item automobiles. Another $100,000 went on 
dispatching several tie rods to the Moscow region.... 
  Admittedly, "Rosugol" suspected that something was amiss 
but, 
fearing a scandal, preferred to extend the dubious contract in 
the hope of at least getting something more out of America. 
Unfortunately, it hoped in vain. Who knows how long all this 
would have gone on had the scandal not broken in the United 
States. 
<H5>  Overdoing Things By 400 Years </H5>
  Initially local businessmen asked questions. In fobbing off 
our naive compatriots, Branson had overdone things somewhat. He 
produced exclusively for the Russian market an advertising 
brochure on his firm with beautiful photographs of other plants, 
calling them the property of Consolidated Service Corporation. 
The amazement of the real owners, when they found out about 
this document, knew no bounds. And the U.S. Internal Revenue 
Service also took an interest in the lawyer's spending. As a 
result, David Branson was arrested, and the U.S. Justice 
Department appealed through the Russian General Prosecutor's 
Office to the Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] Investigations Committee for help in investigating the 
case, which in principle affected us more than the Americans. 
  Nikolay Psyrkov, an investigator with the Administration 
for the Investigation of Particularly Important Cases, did all 
that his U.S. colleagues needed -- he questioned witnesses and 
participants in the events and visited the empty site in 
Serebryanoprudskiy Rayon which had been carefully prepared for 
the construction of the plants promised by the lawyer. Then, 
taking with him as the main victim Valeriy Zaydenvark, deputy 
general director of "Rosugol," traveled to Oklahoma to take part 
in the trial. The Russian investigator's professional job and 
the deputy general director's sorry story made an indelible 
impression on the Oklahoma jury. David Branson was found guilty 
on 50 counts. In January he faces a total of 400 years' 
imprisonment. Following the confiscation and sale of the 
brickmaker lawyer's property, Russia should get back around 
$400,000 of the $1.3 million it lost in advance payments. 
  The Americans will be getting something too -- help from the 
Russian Federation MVD's Investigations Committee in 
investigating an affair that has cost the U.S. medical insurance 
system $1 billion.... 
<H5>  Jacobo Martinez Greenberg, or a Personal Magnet </H5>
  It would be naive to imagine that our emergent homegrown 
version of capitalism would suffer from intrigues by foreign 
adventurists without retaliating. Former Soviet citizens who 
now have the world as their oyster have been making money in the 
most unexpected situations with an inventiveness hard for 
Westerners to grasp. One such situation perpetrated a cynical 
and outrageous crime against the much-vaunted U.S. medical 
insurance system. 
  The leaders of the sinister operation were three natives of 
the former Soviet Union. The leader was Mikhail Smushkevichus 
-- aka Moss, aka Jacobo Martinez Greenberg, aka Ivan Pavlov 
Sanchez -- and his two henchmen Michael (Mikhail Grigoryevich) 
Fayman and Feliks Kolgovskiy. In their former homeland they 
were known as the organizers of a firm to provide Soviet 
citizens with jobs abroad. Attractive employers' "contracts" 
were sold all over at the time. As a result, none of the 
500,000 people who took the tempting bait actually went abroad 
-- but Jacobo Martinez Greenberg did, along with his "comrades" 
and the startup capital for his next business. 
  Basing themselves in Los Angeles, they set up a network of 
mobile diagnostic centers and around 300 bogus companies, and 
opened a huge number of accounts. This entire armada was 
targeted against the U.S. medical insurance system. The actual 
ins and outs of the affair are relatively complicated, and we 
will not go into them. But the results were stunning. The 
swindlers earned more than $50 million in pure profit, and the 
damage they have done is estimated at $1 billion. 
  Today they are all under investigation, and each faces a 
total of up to 1,500 years in jail. Nobody knows where the 
stolen millions are, but the Americans believe them to be in 
Russia or Lithuania. 
<H5>  No Money Without a Treaty </H5>
  Nikolay Psyrkov, the investigator with the Russian MVD 
Investigations Committee's Administration for the Investigation 
of Particularly Important Cases, to whom we spoke on his return 
from the United States, pointed to his office safe: 
  "There are several files in there, files on the embezzlement 
of $33 million, $10 million, and one for $50 million. There is 
a pretty standard operating procedure. Someone does the job, 
the money is put in foreign banks, and they leave the country. 
And in each case it is virtually impossible to get the stolen 
money back to Russia or to bring the fraudster himself to 
trial...." 
  Unfortunately, the success in investigating the Branson and 
Smushkevichus-Greenberg affairs was possible only thanks to the 
personal ties between Russian and American investigators and 
so-called cooperation by agreement -- under the "you scratch our 
back" principle. In a number of other cases this simply does 
not apply. Strangely enough, we have concluded treaties on 
legal help in investigating criminal cases with just 17 
countries, mainly in the former socialist camp. No documents 
have yet been signed with the main countries where our economic 
refugees usually hide and where our criminal structures keep 
their capital -- the United States, Austria, and Britain. In 
this situation it is impossible to track movements of stolen 
money through bank accounts, spending, or the sources of 
criminal financial operations; consequently, it is also 
impossible to prove that crimes have been committed.... 
  Today all requests for help on specific criminal cases in 
the United States, for instance, have a long, hard route to 
travel -- from the MVD Investigations Committee to the General 
Prosecutor's Office to the Foreign Ministry to the embassy to 
the U.S. Justice Department; three or four months are quite 
enough for criminals to hide money and go into hiding 
themselves. The same thing happens in reverse too. Suffice it 
to say that our investigators received the request for help on 
the Branson case directly. The official request only arrived 
through the usual channels when Nikolay Psyrkov, having done 
everything necessary, was setting off for the trial in Oklahoma. 
  But even personal contacts will not save us. The gaps in 
criminal legislation are too big. How can we explain to Western 
colleagues that someone is under investigation for suspicion of 
what is still called "embezzlement of socialist property?" Or 
that he has been charged under Article 147 of the Russian 
Criminal Code with "fraud," which the Americans break down into 
20 separate crimes? Nor are things clear regarding the return 
of stolen property from abroad. When it is simply a matter of 
money, everything is more or less understandable, but when that 
money has been invested in shares, land, or real estate the 
waters are much muddier. 
  I was told at the Investigations Committee that they 
themselves had tried to clarify why treaties on legal assistance 
in criminal cases are taking so long to conclude. They had 
found themselves in a Bermuda Triangle among the Foreign 
Ministry, the General Prosecutor's Office, and the Justice 
Department. Nobody in these three departments was able to say 
anything convincing -- they just sent you on to the next one. 
And that was the end of the matter. Yet, while officials are 
thrashing things out, the land of democratic reforms is simply a 
paradise for both Russian and foreign fraudsters. The main 
thing is to get out of the country with your loot in time. Once 
out, you can take things easy.

  [Text] Cairo January 4 TASS -- The first joint exercise of 
Kuwaiti and Russian naval forces ended in the Persian Gulf on 
Tuesday. The exercise lasting 12 days involved several Kuwaiti 
warships as well as a large anti-submarine ship, the Admiral 
Vinogradov, a large landing ship, the Nikolay Vilkov, and an 
auxiliary vessel of the Russian Navy. 
  The exercise was carried out in conformity with a treaty on 
joint defence between the two countries which was concluded late 
last November. 
  According to military observers, it was conducted at a high 
professional level. All tasks set forth before the crews were 
successfully fulfilled. 
  Referring to a statement by the spokesman of the Kuwaiti 
Defence Ministry, the Sawt al-Arab radio station reported on 
Tuesday that preparations are now in progress to conduct another 
Kuwaiti-Russian exercise which will involve all services -- the 
navies, air forces and land troops.

<F P=106> [Report from Vietnam by V. Konnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Konnov] A great deal has changed, both in our 
own country and in the countries of the former socialist camp. 
The stormy debate about who owes whom more has subsided. The 
bombastic statements about proletarian internationalism and 
fraternal assistance have disappeared. What remains is business 
as usual. In this respect the Vietsovpetro Russian-Vietnamese 
joint venture has stood the test of time. Established a decade 
ago, it produced its first oil in 1986. And recently workers 
were being congratulated in the terse language of posters on the 
achievement of having extracted 20 million tonnes of oil. The 
banner slogans may look somewhat naive and old-fashioned today, 
but they must not obscure the main point: An entire community 
of Russian oil workers is living and working in the south of 
Vietnam. Oil extraction is helping to pay Vietnam's debts. And 
yields are rising. 
  A new floating rig is being readied for dispatch here. It is 
intended for the White Dragon deposit -- the richest oil deposit 
on Vietnam's south coast.

<F P=106> [By Yuriy Selivanov and Boris Zamchinskiy; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Announcer] An operation to thwart the smuggling 
out of a large batch of radioactive materials which, according 
to the investigative bodies, could be used to produce nuclear 
weapons, has been carried out by subunits of the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs together with Interpol. 
  [Selivanov] A criminal gang specializing in the export of 
enriched uranium produced at CIS countries' nuclear industry 
facilities was detained during the operation. A total of 240 
capsules containing 1.5 kg of radioactive material were 
confiscated. 
  Of late law-enforcement bodies are increasingly coming up 
against criminal activities with a clearly pronounced nuclear 
bias. The impression is that the protection of enterprises 
producing nuclear components leaves much to be desired. 
  Lowering of the nuclear safety standards is fraught with the 
most serious consequences in our time. The attempt to smuggle 
out radioactive material which was foiled in Odessa is another 
reminder of the urgent need to adopt prompt interstate measures 
in this area.

<F P=106> [By Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitry Voskoboinikov, Igor </F>
Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoi and others; from the "Diplomatic 
Panorama" feature] 
  [Text] The forecast about personnel changes in Russia's 
Foreign Ministry, published by INTERFAX on New Year's eve, has 
been completely realized. On December 30, Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin endorsed the appointment of three deputy foreign 
ministers. 
  Russia's former ambassador to Spain, Igor Ivanov, has been 
appointed to the post of first deputy foreign minister. The 
other deputy foreign ministers are Albert Chernyshov, 
ex-ambassador to Turkey, and Aleksandr Panov, ex-ambassador to 
the Republic of Korea. Panov has been replaced by former deputy 
foreign minister Georgiy Kunadze. 
  According to INTERFAX sources, Chernyshov and Panov will be 
in charge of Asian affairs (Panov - Japan and Asian and Pacific 
Region, and Chernyshov - the Middle East). 
  The letter of resignation handed to President Yeltsin by 
former first deputy foreign minister Anatoliy Adamishin 
following his election to the State Duma as a representative of 
the Yavlinskiy- Boldyrev-Lukin bloc makes it unclear what Ivanov 
will do, said a high-ranking Russian diplomat. 
  He said that according to initial plans, Kozyrev was to have 
two first deputies - Adamishin and Ivanov, the latter to be in 
charge of Europe. Now that Adamishin has decided to quit the 
Foreign Ministry, Ivanov's responsibilities are likely to be 
enlarged, he said. 
  In his opinion, the vacancy will be filled soon. 
  "Practice shows that the minister must have two first 
deputies," he added. 
  He found it difficult to say who exactly will become one of 
Kozyrev's first deputies. "The situation will become clear next 
week, when Kozyrev will resume his work following a brief 
leave," he said. 
  He also noted that the personnel changes should not be 
perceived as an alarm signal. "It is normal practice, allowing 
diplomats to develop," said the Russian diplomat.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Gorbachev by Waldemar Gontarski and </F>
Iwona Parchimowicz in Moscow; date not given: "The Return of 
the Bolsheviks"] 
  [Text] [WPROST] What do you think of the Zhirinovskiy 
phenomenon? 
  [Gorbachev] Do not fear the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon. The 
voters voted for his party in order to express their disapproval 
of the authorities in power until now. The result of the voting 
is merely a reflection of their disapproval of those at the head 
of the government. Do not think that fascist ideology enjoys 
such a great success in our society, and that a fascist ego 
dwells in the Russian soul. 
  [WPROST] Do you sympathize with Yavlinskiy's group? 
  [Gorbachev] I do nothing surreptitiously. I am closely 
watching Yavlinskiy's group, Travkin's Democratic Party of 
Russia, and the Civic Union. To be honest, the Union has lost 
its distinctness, even though realists, entrepreneurs, and 
economic activists, people who control the economic situation on 
a day-to-day basis, are connected with it. Very much depends on 
these people, and they are backed by the masses. However, on a 
Federation level, people from the Union are looking about them 
as if they do not know what to do. I find this very sad, and 
that is why I support Yavlinskiy, even though I should be 
supporting the Alliance. 
  [WPROST] What made you decide to vote in favor of the 
constitution proposed by Boris Yeltsin? 
  [Gorbachev] I am in favor of Yeltsin's draft, but it still 
requires a lot of hard work on it in the State Duma. There are 
two issues in particular that must be considered. First, there 
is no balance between the different types of authority at the 
Federation level. I support the idea of a presidential 
republic, which means a strong president and strong government. 
But I cannot come to terms with the pitiful situation in which 
our parliament has found itself. A strong president, plus a 
strong parliament and independent Constitutional Court -- that 
is the arrangement that best suits Russia's interests. Yet the 
president is keeping the candidacies for the Constitutional 
Court in his pocket. There is still the problem of the conflict 
between the center and the regions. The provinces are prepared 
to assume responsibility, but first they must be granted the 
relevant powers. How can one undertake privatization and bring 
help to the poorest sectors of society if one does not have any 
powers, for example a suitable fiscal policy? 
  As far as the parliamentary election is concerned, it is 
difficult to consider it a free election. It has been called 
for by the very authorities that are taking part in it. These 
authorities will now appoint election commissions, and in the 
end they will count the votes themselves. 
  [WPROST] Then why are you taking part in such an election? 
  [Gorbachev] Because we must pass through all this as quickly 
as possible, for there is no return to the past. Let the 
authorities display their programs, then we will see what it is 
they want. A politician may convince his opponents, but he 
cannot escape from real life. And Russia's political reality is 
such that if the present ruling team does not alter its program, 
we are going to bear the consequences. But their are incapable 
of making changes. I can see how very undecided they are. 
President Yeltsin says "one cannot rely on force any longer," 
Gaydar says one can, and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin simply says 
"the era of shock therapy is over." They are all beginning to 
play for time. The prime minister fell ill just before the 
election. I wish him health, of course, but his sickness 
occurred at the best possible time. Gaydar attempted dialogue 
with the miners and withdrew straightaway. The miners stuck to 
their guns. And how many more collective interests like this 
are there? 
  [WPROST] In that case, when will the next putsch take place? 
  [Gorbachev] It is possible to avoid such an eventuality. 
This election has enabled various parties and groups to 
consolidate. Now the process of forming coalitions and joint 
programs will be faster. Perhaps that is the only favorable 
result of the election, although the new parliament will once 
again consist of a mixture of people from whom one does not know 
what to expect. All sorts of surprises are in store for is. 
  [WPROST] Who is going to head the new government? Will 
Yeltsin want to choose between Chernomyrdin and Gaydar? 
  [Gorbachev] For some time now, the president has kept a 
distance from Russia's Choice in order at appear as a neutral 
referee, the leader of the nation. Yeltsin has said that he 
will cooperate with all the parties that enter parliament. And 
yet his entire sympathies lie with Russia's Choice. He is also 
playing for time. 
  [WPROST] Gennadiy Burbulis, strategist from Russia's Choice, 
has admitted that, in the long run, Yeltsin might be merely an 
unnecessary burden on the Democrats. 
  [Gorbachev] Have you not noticed that the Democrats are 
distancing themselves from the president and turning themselves 
into an independent force? Notice what Gavril Popov said: "I 
have resigned from the post of mayor of Moscow because I do not 
want to become a second Rutskoy, a representative of authority 
without any powers. I do not agree with the president." They 
have started their own game and they do not need the president. 
But Yeltsin has noticed everything, and the conduct of the 
"democrats" is not escaping the attention of the Kremlin's 
advisers. 
  [WPROST] Will you take an active part in political life 
after the elections? 
  [Gorbachev] I am already doing so by talking to you. 
  [WPROST] I meant political activity. 
  [Gorbachev] The students union of Nizhniy Novgorod has 
suggested that I run for parliament. I have also received 
offers form Moscow, St. Petersburg, and the northern Caucasus. 
I refused, because I do not want to assume any state post. For 
the time being, I see no reason to alter my present status. And 
later? We will see. 
  [WPROST] What is your attitude toward the present Russian 
president? 
  [Gorbachev] That is not going to distract my attention. His 
attitude toward me should not concern you, and my attitude 
toward him even less so. We can discuss politics, you are most 
welcome to do so. After all, Russia requires a complete change 
of politics. Look where the policies pursued over the past two 
years have brought us -- the Bolsheviks are back in the Kremlin. 
Until now I have called them neo-Bolsheviks, but now I see that 
they are real. They are using the same methods of action, only 
under a different banner. The Bolsheviks of 1917 chased everyone 
off to the state farms, today's Bolsheviks are chasing everyone 
away from them. What kind of democrats are they? The 
individual means nothing to them, that is why I shun calling 
them democrats. 
  [WPROST] What about the Army? 
  [Gorbachev] The Army should not be brought out onto the 
streets. Everything should be resolved by political means. 
  [WPROST] Would you not have brought the tanks out into the 
streets on 3 and 4 October? 
  [Gorbachev] I tried to do that in March 1991, but I quickly 
realized how it would end. Therefore I ordered the soldiers 
back to their barracks. 
  [WPROST] You are sneering at Russian domestic policy. What 
about foreign policy? According to Yeltsin, when Germany united 
in 1990, you reached an agreement with Western leaders that NATO 
would not expand eastwards. 
  [Gorbachev] That is right. International agreements contain 
a clause whereby neither NATO, nor even the FRG itself, will 
deploy any forces on the territory of the former GDR [German 
Democratic Republic]. I think the question of the admission of 
Central and Eastern European countries to NATO has been wrongly 
presented. Perhaps it is because the Americans are needlessly 
afraid that their role will diminish. The Europeans should 
explain to them that Europe must decisively shape its own future 
with the participation of the United States and Canada. Such is 
the reality of international politics. Everything else is 
merely a game. 
  However, there is something else that worries me more. 
Perhaps Russia has made people nervous because of its 
"imperial" way of behavior or because of some of the statements 
made by Russian politicians. Basically there is nothing behind 
these statements, but they have been made nonetheless. 
Representatives of the authorities have begun to compete with 
"patriots" to see who can best defend Russia's interests. They 
all realize that society is stunned by the collapse of the USSR 
and the socialist camp. However, the road to reconstructing the 
state follows a different course. Our friends in Central and 
Eastern Europe should be clearly told that Russia will never 
conduct warfare. Such activity should be rejected once and for 
all. We must build a common European home, and from both 
directions, east and west. Despite everything, structures 
common to the entire continent should be formed. 
  [WPROST] We were building a common European home when you 
were still in office. 
  [Gorbachev] There are mechanisms that exist on paper, there 
is the Paris Charter, and nothing should be added to them. 
However there is a lack of real instruments, various 
institutions, with the aid of which one might fulfill these 
plans. For example, Europe needs a security council. Expanding 
alliances is a bad solution, because it divides Europe instead 
of uniting it. Do we want to proceed from one division to 
another? Are 12 NATO member-countries to determine the fate of 
the entire continent?

  [Text] With respect to the criminal case of the Ilascu 
group, the CSCE Mission in Moldova has proposed that a court of 
justice consisting of three judges each representing Chisinau, 
Tiraspol, and other countries should be set up. If one or all 
of the culprits is found guilty by that court, the execution of 
the sentence should be carried out by Moldova. Radio Rossii, 
which broadcast the news, mentioned that the Tiraspol 
authorities favor the CSCE suggestion, provided that Russia, a 
country that enjoys the confidence of the Dniester leaders, 
should vouch for the independence of the court. 
  The CSCE Mission in Moldova has also warned against the 
perils of using the Ilascu case for political purposes. 
  A commentary broadcast last night by BBC cites, among other 
things, a statement by Mr. Pavel Barbalat, the chairman of the 
Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic of Moldova, that he had 
not been briefed on the CSCE recommendations and that the 
Moldovan party would refuse such a formula. In this way 
[Dniester leader Grigore] Maracuta, Mr. Barbalat assessed, 
merely wishes to have the legality of his office confirmed, 
although he had assumed that office arbitrarily. The sole 
solution to the problem would be the unconditional transfer of 
the prisoners from Tiraspol to Chisinau, as otherwise there are 
no guarantees that in the future other separatist forces would 
not stage a new trial and then ask for a three-party trial of 
the case. 
  Also according to the BBC, Mr. Dumitru Postovan, the chief 
prosecutor of the Republic of Moldova, has also stated in turn 
that he has no knowledge about any such suggestion by the CSCE 
Mission.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Army formations have been sustaining 
enormous losses in their incessant attacks on Karabakh defensive 
positions for the past three weeks. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press Service 
reported that heavy fighting continued on the north and 
northeast fronts on the evening of 3 January. After losing one 
tank, one infantry fighting vehicle, and 90 soldiers and 
officers, the enemy retreated to its initial positions. Five 
fighters were killed and 13 wounded on the Karabakh side. The 
fighting has continued in these sectors since this morning. 
  The same source says Azerbaijani soldiers frequently 
surrender. Four gave themselves up on 3 January alone and 14 
have surrendered over the past three weeks. They confessed to 
being forced to fight fearing execution by the so-called 
deterrent detachments, which stay behind the Army formations. 
According to the prisoners, the deterrent detachments are 
basically formed of Afghan mojahedin because the Azerbaijanis 
themselves refuse to fire on their own soldiers. 
  Friends, for many days now we have been unable--through no 
fault of our own--to report on the situation in the border 
regions of the Republic. Telephone links have been disrupted 
preventing us from receiving reports from the Defense Ministry's 
press service.

  [Text] Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Minister Povilas Gylys 
sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. In 
his letter, the minister mentioned, once again, the meeting of 
the foreign ministers of the three Baltic states with the U.S. 
secretary of state in Riga and expressed his gratitude for the 
constant cooperation with Lithuania and other Baltic states by 
the United States. 
  Lithuania, the letter reads, is especially interested in 
seeking the assistance and close cooperation with the United 
States in the areas of national security and defense and in 
reinforcing the economic reforms and democratic institutions. 
  Although the last Russian soldier has left Lithuania, the 
letter goes on, we still remain in a security vacuum zone. The 
presence of foreign troops in Latvia and Estonia (?is a 
destabilizing factor in this region). The great concentration 
of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region causes especially 
great concern. Therefore, Lithuania would like to draw the 
attention of international [passage indistinct]. Following the 
elections to the Russian parliament, Russian foreign policy may 
become more nationalistic and more aggressive toward the Baltic 
states. 
  The minister stressed that Lithuania, while aspiring to 
integrate into the Western political, economic, and security 
systems, regards NATO as her future guarantee. Lithuania, free 
of foreign troops and national minority problems, is seeking to 
strengthen cooperation with NATO. We welcome the initiative of 
Partnership for Peace, hoping that it will stimulate cooperation 
from partnership to membership. 
  Foreign investment is an important factor in the development 
of the economy of our country. In this context, investment by 
the United States is very significant to Lithuania. Our country 
is prepared to sign several agreements [passage indistinct].

  [Text] Moscow, 5 January (ITAR-TASS) -- A statement by 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary of the Russian president, 
was issued here today. It says: 
  In connection with Lithuania's official request to join 
NATO, 
I am authorized to state the following. 
  A desire to join international organizations is an 
acknowledged right of independent states. Democratic Russia 
respects such rights. 
  At the same time, the haste with which some countries, among 
them the Lithuanian Republic, are striving for membership in the 
military-political alliance cannot but put us on our guard. 
Regrettably, this tendency toward a bloc mentality is 
manifesting itself at a time when the world's major powers are 
earnestly seeking instruments for dismantling the inheritance of 
the "cold war" and are declaring their desire to build relations 
on the basis of principles of partnership in the name of peace. 
  Democratic Russia, with its new military doctrine and 
following the principles of interstate relations, exclude any 
kind of aggressive displays on her part in foreign policy. In 
this connection, the motives and arguments of countries aspiring 
to membership of NATO are unconvincing. 
  The president of Russia is worried at the tendency toward 
the 
expansion of the bloc system. The encouragement of such a 
tendency would contradict declared intentions to build mutual 
relations on principles of trust, partnership, and equilibrium. 
  The president is worried that expanding NATO with new 
members 
from the countries in direct proximity to Russia's borders will 
provoke a negative reaction in Russian public opinion, promote 
the development of undesirable attitudes in civilian and 
military circles, and, ultimately, could lead to 
military-political destabilization in a region which is of key 
importance for the destiny of the world. 
  President Boris Yeltsin expects that the leaders of NATO 
member-countries and the NATO leadership will dispel the 
impression of ambiguity in their position on the issue, which 
has a bearing both on the destiny of the world and the national 
interests of Russia.

  [Text] Minsk January 5 TASS -- Belarusian Parliament head 
Stanislav Shushkevich has sent a letter to the CIS executive 
secretariat to confirm that Belarus has signed the CIS 
collective security agreement, the parliamentary press service 
announced today. 
  The press-service said the problem had to be addressed anew 
because the procedure of the preliminary signing of the 
agreement was interpreted incorrectly by some officials. 
  The parliament empowered its head, Stanislav Shushkevich "to 
sign the agreement on collective security after making a 
statement on certain reservations," it said. 
  These reservations "rule out in particular the use of 
Belarusian Armed Forces on the territory of other countries, and 
the stationing and use of Armed Forces of other states on the 
Belarusian territory without the express permission of the 
Belarusian Parliament," the press-service said.

  [Text] Russia and Belarus will merge their monetary 
systems in the second half of January. The Russian ruble will 
freely circulate on the territory of Belarus. This agreement 
has been reached at the Russian-Belarusian negotiations 
conducted by Boris Yeltsin and the government leaders of both 
countries, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vyacheslav Kebich. After 
almost three hours of talks, the prime ministers signed an 
agreement on the unification of monetary systems of the Russian 
Federation and Belarus. The document says that monetary systems 
of both countries will be merged after Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
Vyacheslav Kebich sign in late January in Minsk more than 10 
agreements regulating the mechanisms of this process. In an 
interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Vyacheslav Kebich 
said it was agreed that the one-to-one exchange rate for both 
currencies during the unification be established. Vyacheslav 
Kebich believes that Belarus' transition to the Russian ruble 
will be a continued process lasting for three to six months. 
This is caused by purely technical problems of Belarus [words 
indistinct].

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Vyacheslav 
Kebich: `Belarusian-Russian Political Statement Likely To Appear 
After the New Year'"] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Not all the documents discussed at the 
CIS summit in Ashgabat bear your signature.... 
  [Kebich] A total of 25 documents had been prepared for 
discussion at the level of heads of state, and 19 -- at the 
level of prime ministers. Some of those documents, indeed, we 
did not sign, including the agreement on assistance to 
Tajikistan in proportion to national budgets. We were among 
those who opposed adopting this resolution, saying that as long 
as we receive no assistance in eliminating the consequences of 
the Chernobyl accident, we cannot grant financial aid to 
Tajikistan. We have nothing against sending foodstuffs and 
other products there, but we do not agree to pay a VAT just for 
them. Russia backed us on this issue, and so did other states. 
It was decided to send the draft for completion. 
  Another document that we did not sign stipulated the 
unification of prices and taxes, and thus, the lifting of 
customs duties. The document was not approved at the initiative 
of Russia and Belarus. We cannot grant equal conditions to all 
the states, because Russia and Belarus spent a long time paving 
the path and we should receive the status of trailblazers. 
  We also refrained from signing a document on the mechanism 
of 
enacting the collective security treaty, because in fact, we had 
not joined the treaty. This happened because CIS members did 
not acknowledge the onetime declaration by Stanislav 
Shushkevich, and maintained that the document should be signed 
without provisos. On the other hand, the collective security 
treaty has not been ratified by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet as 
of yet. We also did not sign a number of less relevant 
agreements. 
  [Reporter] Which of the signed agreements do you consider 
most significant? In general, what can be regarded as the most 
momentous outcome of the Ashgabat summit? 
  [Kebich] First of all, I want to emphasize the agreement on 
investments. Similar agreements had been signed with foreign 
states, but somehow this had fallen through the cracks and they 
had not existed within the CIS framework. That was a paradox. 
The signing of this document facilitates investments in 
neighboring states, the forming of joint-stock companies, and 
leasing enterprises in CIS states. Our legislative opposition 
has always stressed the urgent need for such an agreement. The 
treaty was signed by all the participants, and so were the 
agreements on joint financing of the Interstate Economic Court 
and the Television and Radio Company. The most important thing 
was that agreements vital for the functioning of the economic 
union were signed. I also want to underline the fact that 
Turkmenistan has become a legal member of the union. Thus, only 
Ukraine has not joined the economic union yet, but we believe 
that the situation will change in the immediate future.... 
Among other important agreements there are also the ones on 
communications and medicine.... Medicine will be exempt from 
VAT, and thus will be cheaper. 
  The cooperation agreement alone was worth going to 
Ashgabat. It envisions that if we receive oil or gas as part of 
cooperation deals, that is if the end product is returned to the 
producer of raw materials, we will not pay any taxes or customs 
duties. This will significantly reduce prices. 
  At the same time, we also held bilateral talks in Ashgabat. 
I signed a bilateral agreement with Kazakhstan, while Uladzimir 
Zalamay signed such agreements with all the other republics 
except Russia, Moldova, and Tajikistan. I will be visiting 
Moldova soon, while we need time to reach an accord with 
Tajikistan. With regard to Russia, after we sign an agreement 
on merging our financial systems, we will not need any bilateral 
agreements at all. There were a lot of personal talks in 
Ashgabat, including my meeting with Russian Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin. 
  Bilateral talks with the Turkmen leadership also yielded 
dividends. Turkmenistan remains our primary debtor. We agreed 
with Chernomyrdin that Russia will not hinder shipments of 
Turkmen gas via its territory. In addition in 1994, 
Turkmenistan is going to supply us with 1,000,000 metric tons of 
industrial oil. Kazakhstan also agreed to ship industrial oil 
to Belarus, while our commercial organizations will be able to 
buy Kazakh oil. There is one more thing. In January, we will 
receive 90,000 metric tons of high quality wheat as compensation 
for the work of Belarusians in Kustanay Oblast. Truck and 
tractor drivers and combine operators who took part in 
harvesting in that oblast will receive another 11,000 metric 
tons. 
  [Reporter] Can we anticipate the merging of financial 
systems in the immediate future? 
  [Kebich] We are rapidly approaching this goal. I want to 
get this straight to everybody -- forming a monetary union with 
Russia will not preclude pursuing independent policies. By the 
way, we adopted the national budget some time ago. In Ashgabat, 
Aleksandr Shokhin told me: "You were faster, and now Russia will 
have to adjust its budget to the Belarusian one." This means 
that politically, we have gained a lot. 
  [Reporter] What other Russian leaders did you confer with in 
Ashgabat? 
  [Kebich] I talked to almost all of them, including a short 
conversation with Boris Yeltsin. He confirmed our agreements 
with Chernomyrdin and Shokhin. 
  [Reporter] Who among the Russian leadership supports the 
merging of our financial systems, and who opposes it? 
  [Kebich] There is no opposition, although some people may 
have doubts. However, there is one problem. When we resolve 
issues at the highest level everything goes smoothly, but every 
bureaucrat at lower levels wants to demonstrate his omnipotence. 
Thus, we decided that there will be no more agreements at the 
level of clerks. Agreements should be signed by the highest 
officials and then be carried out by clerks. 
  [Reporter] Will a political declaration be announced soon? 
  [Kebich] Although we agreed on this, both the Russian and 
Belarusian schedules are so packed with events that the 
declaration may be postponed through a lack of time and not a 
lack of desire. As we know, the Russian leadership is concerned 
with the future of its two legislative chambers. Anyway, I 
believe, that a political declaration will be made shortly after 
the New Year. This is my forecast. 
  [Reporter] The CIS Charter has not been ratified by our 
legislature. Do you think there may be complications in the 
course of the ratification process? 
  [Kebich] I believe there will be no problems until the 
clause dealing with collective security is discussed. This will 
initiate another great debate. We have plenty of experts 
majoring in disputes.

  [Text] It is very likely that Russian special agencies 
stand behind the Kebich government; this was declared by 
Vladimir Novik, Belarusian Supreme Soviet deputy and secretary 
of the legislative standing commission on the economy, in an 
interview with SVABODA [Freedom] on 5 January. "You can be 
absolutely sure," he said, "that stabilizing the Russian ruble 
or the U.S. dollar means undermining our economy and robbing our 
people. This would strengthen the economies of the countries 
whose currencies would be allowed in Belarus. Who is devising 
these kinds of policies? The government of an independent state 
or a special agency? The latter, is the most likely answer."

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Gaydukevich, chairman of the Popular </F>
Movement of Belarus, by Andrey Korabelnikov; place and date not 
given: "There Are Only Three Forces in Belarus"] 
  [Excerpt] There are 13 political parties and over 
100 different movements in Belarus today. A SEM DNEY 
correspondent has interviewed People's Deputy Sergey 
Gaydukevich, chairman of the Popular Movement of Belarus [PMB], 
on the real political power of these organizations. 
  [Gaydukevich] There are many parties and movements. 
However, that does not imply that they are cardinally 
different. The world has long been acquainted with the pendulum 
principle. This principle accounts for only two determining 
forces. These forces can be assessed in many terms, but in 
their essence they are either "right" or "left." Political 
power is also controlled either by the former or the latter -- 
it never rests in the middle. Therefore, any party or movement 
gravitates either to the "right" or to the "left." One force 
stands for the superiority of government property and the 
implementation of major social programs, the other stands for 
the superiority of the private sector and the reduction of state 
subsidies for social security programs. A state that tries to 
stop the movement of that pendulum is in dire straits. 
Unfortunately, this is the situation in which we find ourselves. 
  There are only three real political forces in the Republic: 
the PMB, the Belarusian Popular Front [BPF], and...the Council 
of Ministers. All the others are satellites. With regard to 
the Council of Ministers being a third political force, it is an 
obvious fact. It is not without reason that people speak about 
Kebich's policy; no other politicians or economists are 
mentioned. In our situation, this force speaks of reforms, but, 
thus far, its declarations have not been supported by practical 
actions. 
  The second influential force was -- and remains -- the BPF. 
This organization has a concrete political and economic 
program. BPF representatives work in different command 
structures, participate in Supreme Soviet activities, and exert 
significant influence on mass media. The determining factor in 
their activities is private property. However, their proposal 
for the resolution of the national question has pushed many 
people away from the BPF. The BPF is supported by fewer and 
fewer people. 
  The third force is the PMB, which is a peculiar union of 
unions. We bring together 22 parties and movements from 
throughout the Republic. What does that mean? It means that 
all these organizations are united in one front. Their 
independence is secured, but common goals will be achieved 
together. The basic principle of our movement is the return of 
a strong system of state power, as well as economic diversity 
with social security guarantees for workers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov, deputy </F>
director of the Institute of Economy at the Belarusian Academy 
of Sciences, by Tamara Markina; place and date not given: "We 
Should Introduce Our Own Currency To Be Able To Conquer the 
Market's Everest"] 
  [Text] Market relations in Belarus are the cause of our 
despair. Is this what we fought for? Why are our neighbors 
reaping the fruits of market reforms while we are making no 
headway? Moreover, we are sliding ever closer to economic 
carnage. Why is Belarus -- whose standard of living was one of 
the highest in the USSR -- lagging behind our Baltic neighbors 
and Russia? Production is falling, hopes are expiring.... 
  Professor Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov, deputy director of the 
Institute of Economy at the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, is 
one of those few people who can see a real way out of this 
predicament. 
  Today, Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov visited our editorial 
office. I hope that our interview with him will help some people 
to differentiate between the "black" and "white" sides of our 
economy. Some years ago, many residents of Minsk started making 
"shopping-tours" of Poland and Turkey. Currently, most of them 
have accumulated the initial capital. The second wave of 
"shopping- tours" rolled into the Baltics, Moscow, Smolensk, St. 
Petersburg.... They have literally stripped the Belarusian 
foodstuffs market. Some of my acquaintances state that Belarus 
has raised market reforms in Baltic states and Russia with its 
dairy products... What is your opinion on the issue? 
  [Tarasov] I would support such commercial junkets if our 
economy was healthy and sound. Why not? Exports which 
stimulate production are growing.... Our Belarusian "merchants" 
make profits of around 500,000 rubles [R] on every commercial 
trip. 
  Nevertheless, given our deficit economy and falling 
production, these exports will not bring us any good. I would 
like our merchants to bring back to Belarus some Russian goods, 
however, they do not do this. They bring Russian rubles and one 
ruble is worth three or four Belarusian "hares." You see: 
Money makes money. However, it is not provided with goods 
produced in Belarus. Next, the twist in the price spiral 
follows.... 
  The next problem is the trade deficit. It turns out that we 
import more goods than we export. Nobody has yet calculated 
this deficit amount. If we could receive precise statistics 
from our state customs checkpoints and the Belarusian National 
Bank, we would be able to coordinate the prices for Belarusian 
goods with the constantly changing prices for imported raw 
materials and energy. 
  If we had these data, we could realize that constantly 
increasing prices for energy resources leave our command economy 
far behind and raise the prices of goods produced in Belarus. 
The main reason for this is the expansionist economic policy of 
Russia. Therefore, we should draw some conclusions. First of 
all, our government should start watching the price policy 
changes of our neighbors. Do you remember the increase in 
prices for glassware in the Baltics when the price of one bottle 
stood at R3 there and 20 kopeks in Belarus? Our neighbors 
started with bottles and since then have achieved serious 
economic reforms. 
  [Markina] Maybe our wages and salaries should also be 
increased, along with prices? 
  [Tarasov] We need a Belarusian currency. Only then we will 
be able to pursue our own policy in the sphere of price changes. 
Currently, we do not have a rate for our Belarusian "hare" 
currency. 
  [Markina] Vladimir Ivanovich, can we expect that everything 
could be automatically resolved when we join the so-called ruble 
zone, which had been promised by our government and the Supreme 
Soviet? 
  [Tarasov] What will this ruble zone look like? That is the 
question. Russia will hardly agree to the establishment of a 
1:1 exchange rate giving the possibility of introducing single 
prices. Everything could have been different if Belarus were a 
subject of the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, Belarus is an 
independent state. Therefore, in my opinion, it is unlikely that 
Russia will introduce a 1:1 exchange rate. Hence, we should 
speak not about a single ruble zone but about a currency union. 
In addition, all the cataclysms of the Russian economy will 
effect the exchange rate of Belarusian payment notes. 
  By the way, this currency union will not be a novelty in the 
realm of international economic relations. For example, the 
Austrian schilling is linked to the German mark. Thus, all 
changes in the German mark affect the financial sector in 
Austria. 
  Our government should demonstrate its political will 
regarding the introduction of our national currency. We have 
been using Belarusian payment notes for some two years. 
However, have they become a solid monetary unit? Yes, they are 
used in payment operations but they do not fulfill another 
function -- the accumulation of capital. Who saves "hares" in 
Belarus? People are saving dollars. Sometimes, they are saving 
Russian rubles. Moreover, Belarusian "hares" are not used in 
export-import financial operations. This means that "hares" do 
not fulfill the function of international money. 
  It is evident that we should introduce our own national 
money. We should not be scared that this will break our 
relations with Russia. On the contrary, they will become 
stronger. Pay attention to the fact that Russian Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin has already visited Lithuania, which introduced its 
own currency, but he has never been to Belarus. 
  It is high time for Belarus to take analogous steps. 
  We should not rely on the "kind uncle." To my regret, many 
people think the opposite. For example, Prime Minister Kebich 
has visited Valday, where he spoke with Chernomyrdin on 
increased deliveries of oil to Belarus. However, where is this 
oil? Currently, the political situation in Russia is extremely 
unstable. Belarus should conduct talks on all levels, including 
contacts between government delegations, individual enterprises, 
and commercial structures. 
  Russia has started creating joint stock companies. We could 
do the same. Belarus can attract Russian partners. However, we 
have no favorable conditions for foreign investments. Belarus 
has hundreds of joint ventures with French, German, and English 
partners, however, not a single one with Russia. At the same 
time, our economic potential depends primarily -- 70-80 percent! 
-- on Russia. We could have no problems with gas if we had 
joint ventures with Russian oil structures. The Baltic states 
do not experience any gas shortages due to the fact that Latvian 
and Lithuanian businessmen have found a common language with 
Russia. I want to emphasize: Progress is obtained by private 
initiative. So, we should stimulate our own Belarusian private 
initiative.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Andrey </F>
Pershin, Andrey Petrovskiy, and Vladimir Shishlin; edited by 
Boris Grishchenko] 
  [Text] President Mircea Snegur met in Chisinau on Tuesday 
[4 January] with Ion Drutse, a noted Moldova writer permanently 
living in Russia. Preparation for parliamentary elections was 
discussed. The elections are due on February 27. 
  Independent experts believe that Drutse's arrival in the 
republic at the peak of the election campaign may tangibly 
affect its outcome. The writer is immensely popular in Moldova, 
so many observers predict that he will be able to win thousands 
of extra votes for the centrist agrarian-democratic and 
social-democratic parties. 
  IF [INTERFAX] Note: Snegur declared in a recent exclusive 
interview with INTERFAX that he was not going to stay neutral, 
and resolutely supported these centrist parties in their 
advocacy of state sovereignty and aversion for reunion with 
Romania. 
  The opposition parties and movements which advocate reunion 
with Romania have been holding rallies in protest against the 
guilty verdict passed on a group of Christian Democratic Popular 
Front supporters by a court in Tiraspol. Snegur administration 
officials regard these actions as part of an anti-presidential 
campaign to charge their chief with betrayal and duplicity. 
  The president's spokesman, Vasile Grozavu, told INTERFAX 
that Snegur emphatically rejects allegations that "he has kept a 
conflict in Moldova's east from the world public. However, it 
was Snegur who invited a CSCE mission to monitor the situation 
in the region and help to remove the differences there. In a 
statement released in Rome, the foreign ministers of the CSCE 
participant-states pledged to spare no further effort to secure 
a settlement. 
  More than that, Snegur has repeatedly urged reactivating a 
four-sided mechanism to resolve the region's problems. The 
issue re-surfaced at a recent summit with Ukraine's President 
Kravchuk. 
  Grozavu dismissed as improper an assertion by some media 
that 
Snegur is responsible "for an economic disaster." It is common 
knowledge, he noted, under what conditions the ministers were 
nominated and appointed in parliament and how many pledges were 
made by certain parliamentary factions behind the scenes and 
otherwise to win some ministers' approval. 
  It was this and nothing else, Grozavu added, that prompted 
the president to back up the initiative to dissolve parliament 
and elect a new legislature with representatives of one party or 
a coalition apt to run the country. 
  Grozavu reported that the president was preparing a special 
statement "about the conflict on the Dniester and its true 
culprits." "The document," he stressed, "would be a convincing 
response to irresponsible charges by those who are making 
patriotism their trade."

  [Text] Moldova's opposition parties and movements 
advocating reunification with Romania have turned the campaign 
against the death sentence passed on leader of the Popular 
Front's Tiraspol branch Ilie Ilascu, into an anti-presidential 
one. They have accused the Moldovan president of treachery and 
duplicity, the president's Press Secretary Vasile Grosavu told 
INTERFAX. 
  He said that the opposition had also accused the president 
of 
making public the conflict in Moldova's eastern regions in the 
summer of 1992. Meanwhile, it was Snegur who invited CSCE 
experts to get acquainted with the situation and help settle the 
conflict between Transdniestria and the central authorities, he 
noted. 
  Moreover, Snegur favors further quadripartite talks between 
Moldova, Russia, Ukraine and Tiraspol, said Grosavu. 
  The press secretary also denied media reports laying the 
blame for the current economic crisis in Moldova on Mircea 
Snegur. 
  Grosavu said that the president's support for the idea of 
dissolving the parliament and holding early parliamentary 
elections was motivated by his plans to lead the country out of 
the economic crisis as soon as possible. 
  Moldovan Prosecutor General Dumitru Postovan has denied 
reports that Snegur was involved in the "dirty deals" linked 
with the notorious Seabeco company.

  [Text] Chisinau January 5 TASS -- Leader of the Centrist 
Popular Union Andrey Safonov has filed his resignation from the 
post of the head of the "OLVIYA-PRES" news agency. 
  Local observers note his resignation is linked with 
strengthening of leftist-radical forces in the leadership of the 
Dniester Republic, Moldova's breakaway province. The radicals 
support Tiraspol's tough position at talks on settlement of the 
Dniester-Chisinau conflict. They also oppose economic and 
social reforms in the region.

  [Text] In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX, the 
republic's Premier Abdulmadjid Samadov said that Tajikistan's 
government had three important tasks to be solved in the short 
term. 
  The first was to conclude the republic's entering the ruble 
zone as soon as possible, which would facilitate surmounting of 
budget deficit which at present totals 95 Bn [billion] rubles. 
  The premier mentioned the necessity to widely use market 
structures in the economy, trading of enterprises which are on 
the brink of bankruptcy as the government's second task. 
According to his estimate, there are dozens of bankrupt 
enterprises in all branches of the national economy already and 
their existence is problematic without additional state 
allocations. These are primarily the Tajik aluminium factory, 
the Vakhsh nitric fertilizers factory and several other large 
sites. 
  The third task is to increase the republic's authority in 
the 
world community against the background of political and economic 
transformations. This will give a real opportunity to receive 
investments in the economy. According to Samadov, a $500 
million credit would enable the republic's economy to develop 
without worsening the living standards of the local population. 
  "In 1994 we shall be experiencing rather painful political 
processes linked with the discussion and adoption of the new 
Constitution, a nation wide referendum on the state system and 
further elections of a new parliament," said Samadov. He 
mentioned social security of certain categories of the 
population, primarily pensioners, families with many children, 
invalids and students, as one of the priority tasks of the 
government. 
  Tajikistan's present government, a country within the CIS, 
takes the obligations of the previous cabinet, indicated Samadov. 
  As far as priorities in the cooperation with other countries 
are concerned, we cannot but mark the role of Russia and Central 
Asia countries, primarily Uzbekistan, said the prime minister. 
In his words, Tajikistan is inclined to cooperate with the West. 
  "We must not forget that the nation's mentality adheres to 
the Moslem religion," emphasized the premier and said that 
Dushanbe pays great attention to its relations with Afghanistan, 
Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.

  [Text] The recent murders of Russians in Tajikistan are of 
a purely criminal character as they are neither religiously, nor 
politically nor ethnically colored, Tajik Vice Prime Minister 
Makhamadsayed Ubaidullayev told a briefing in Dushanbe today. 
  Ubaidullayev said four suspects of a murder of nine people 
in 
the village of Novobad near Dushanbe late at night on December 
30 were arrested yesterday. He added that the suspects did not 
conceal that they had committed the crime with the aim of 
robbery. 
  Ubaidullayev also said that the motive for the murder of 
Father Sergy, a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church in 
Dushanbe on the same night, still remained unclear. The 
investigating bodies were working on a number of likely 
versions, the high official said. 
  The Tajik Interior Ministry announced a considerable 
financial reward for information helping to solve the case. 
  On behalf of the republican government, Ubaidullayev 
expressed condolences to the family and friends of the murdered.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Berezovskiy report: "In Turkestan's Parliaments"] </F>
  [Text] Tashkent -- The parliaments of the three Central 
Asian republics completed their work on New Year's Eve. 
  The Turkmenistan Assembly, without procrastination, ratified 
the recent agreements with Moscow on mutual guarding of the 
border, the status of Russian servicemen, migration and defense 
of migrants' rights, and dual citizenship. President Saparmurat 
Niyazov stressed that the institution of dual citizenship cannot 
be considered a concession to the 400,000 Russians living in the 
republic alone. The agreement is also extremely beneficial to 
Russia's 700,000 Turkmens. 
  There were around 40 questions on the Tajik parliament's 
agenda. Premier A. Abdulladzhanov resigned. Political circles 
in the republic think that the head of government has resigned 
under pressure from the incontrovertible evidence of corruption 
among and embezzlement of public funds by his entourage. The 
new premier is 44-year old Abduzhalil Samatov, the former vice 
premier. He is known as an experienced contemporary economist 
and the successful head of a commercial firm. 
  Head of state I. Rakhmonov's speech at the session was the 
crucial one. He admitted that the Pamir economy is on the verge 
of catastrophe. Civil war has cost the republic too dear. Over 
400 enterprises have been looted and destroyed and whole sectors 
paralyzed. Around 300 major plants, factories, sovkhozes, and 
kolkhozes are on the brink of bankruptcy. 
  The present Uzbekistan Supreme Council has probably met for 
its last session. By unanimously adopting the law on elections 
to the new legislative organ -- the oliy madzhlis -- the 
parliamentarians signed their own sentence. 
  President Islam Karimov addressed the session and 
regrettably 
once again returned to the idea that Russians living in the 
republic cannot be granted dual citizenship owing to their 
possibly interfering in internal affairs and the danger of 
"lessening the patriotic spirit."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA gives 
the findings of an opinion poll on popularity of Russian 
political figures. According to the poll, taken throughout 1993 
on the initiative of the newspaper's editorial board and the VP 
Public Opinion Study Service, the final list of more than 100 
most influential politicians of Russia in 1993 is headed by 
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
The newspaper also carries chronology of all most significant 
dates and events in Russia in the past year. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA on Russia's military doctrine and reforming 
of the country's armed forces: 
  "As far as the development of the country's armed forces is 
concerned, the year 1994 will be notable for the fact that the 
country already has available a practically complete 'military 
package' of laws, right up to basic military regulations. 
  "The 'basic provisions of a military doctrine of the Russian 
Federation', adopted at the end of last year, make the work on 
the development of the armed forces still more conscious 
politically, militarily, economically and from the viewpoint of 
military technology. 
  "However, all that does not at all mean that the new 
parliament will have nothing to do in the field of military 
legislation. On the contrary, rather. Life brings forth new 
and new tasks aimed at fostering a sense of patriotism in 
Russian people, pride for one's native land, and readiness to 
defend it. We must maintain and enhance the defence capability 
of the state and the combat readiness of the army". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who dwelt in detail on 
Kazakhstan-Russia relations and their role in the rallying of 
other sovereign CIS countries. 
  Having pointed out in particular that "unity is the way to 
the prosperity of Russia and Kazakhstan", Nazarbayev explained 
that "strategically Kazakhstan should be in alliance with 
Russia. Both Kazakhstan and russia now need each other". 
  Noting the multi-ethnicity of his country, Nazarbayev said 
this is why "sovereign Kazakhstan is responsible for the 
equality of other nations". 
  TRUD runs an interview with Arkady Volsky, one of the 
leaders 
of the Civic Union, who, upon having recognised the setback 
suffered by the bloc at the December 12 elections in Russia, 
nevertheless pointed out that "the Civic Union representatives 
in the State Duma are intent on constructive work". 
  "We are prepared to back any realistic and welllfounded 
bills 
aimed at promoting real reforms that are of benefit to all 
people in Russia," Volsky said. 
  Touching upon a possible participation of representatives of 
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, headed by 
him, in the work of the Russian Government, Volsky said "We are 
redy to join the government but, naturally, such a government in 
which our philosophy of reforms without 'shock' and unnecessary 
social by- effects would be shared. We are ready for the most 
resolute steps towards reforms but according to the principle: 
Measure seven times and cut off once". 
  PRAVDA on U.S. President Bill Clinton's forthcoming tour 
(beginning on January 8) of a number of European countries, 
including Russia and Belarus: 
  "The busy schedule of the U.S. President's European tour is 
believed to demonstrate the activeness of U.S. foreign policy 
and Washington's leadership in the post-Cold-War period." 
  The tour "does not promise to be simple and easy. In the 
changing world, American claims to leadership are in need of 
continuous backing by specific deeds or new ideas capable of 
taking the fancy of allies and partners. So far, there are not 
so many such ideas in the new administration's foreign-policy 
bag". 
  On the eve of Christmas, celebrated in Russia on January 7, 
all today's newspapers carry articles calling on people to do 
good and show tolerance in the country's present-day difficult 
situation, relate the history of the holiday, its peculiarities 
and traditions.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoi and others] 
  [Text] During a three-sided meeting of the presidents of 
Russia, Ukraine and the United States in Moscow, not all issues, 
if any, concerning nuclear weapons in Ukraine are likely to be 
cleared up. The only thing Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine can do is 
to confirm unambiguously to Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton his 
republic's international commitments on nuclear disarmament and 
promise to submit again the START-I treaty for ratification by 
the new parliament. 
  This statement was made to INTERFAX Wednesday by a senior 
Russian diplomat responsible for Russian-Ukrainian relations. 
  He believes that the likely three-sided summit may present a 
good opportunity for Kravchuk to distance himself in public from 
the partial ratification of the treaty. 
  The diplomat has said the United States promised to Ukraine 
financial aid worth $170 Mn [Million] as soon as the disarmament 
process begins. 
  The Americans are practically-minded people. They will not 
give money to Ukraine for mere promises, he said.

  [Text] Kiev -- Speaking to a UNIAN correspondent, a 
representative of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense press center 
denied Russian media reports (particularly those by ITAR-TASS 
and Ostankino) about Ukrainian-Russian military consultations in 
Kiev on the future fate of the nuclear arms deployed on the 
territory of Ukraine, allegedly due to start on 5 January with 
the participation of Defense Ministers Vitaliy Radetskyy and 
Pavel Grachev. "The Ministry of Defense did not plan for such a 
meeting on 5-6 January," the press center representative said. 
He added that work is in progress on preparations for a 
bilateral agreement on military cooperation, and 
Ukrainian-Russian military consultations on the issue were 
already held from 28 to 29 December in Moscow. According to an 
earlier UNIAN report, the Ukrainian delegation was led by Deputy 
Minister of Defense Ivan Oliynyk. 
  In the view of a high-ranking Ministry of Defense 
representative who would not give his name, a meeting of 
Ukrainian and Russian defense ministry delegations on the 
nuclear arms issue will be possible only after the problem is 
discussed by the presidents of both countries, or at least by 
government delegations.

  [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent was informed at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine on 4 January that Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, has sent a personal message to Qian 
Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and minister of 
foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China, in connection 
with the second anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic 
links between Ukraine and China. In particular the letter notes 
that "China became one of the first states in the world to 
recognize Ukraine, establish diplomatic relations with it, and 
open its embassy in Kiev. China's attitude to the development 
of relations with Ukraine is highly valued in our young country. 
The visits to China by Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, 
and Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council, in this 
short period of time have demonstrated this." 
  It was reported at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the 
legal and contractual basis of inter-state relations between 
both states has been elaborated much better than that with many 
other states which had stronger links with Ukraine prior to the 
break-up of the USSR. Twelve documents were signed during the 
visit to China by Leonid Kravchuk in 1992 alone, some of which 
have already been ratified by both parliaments. According to 
information of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of 
Ukraine, according to the results for 1993, China is the leader 
in the East Asian region in volume of exports from Ukraine. The 
People's Republic of China purchases road technology, electrical 
equipment, timber, cement, metal, pipes, fittings, and other 
goods from us. The structure of products imported from China is 
distributed almost evenly between products of light and textile 
industries, products of the conversion of the Chinese 
military-industrial complex, and agricultural produce. 
  A reception on the occasion of the second anniversary of the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two states 
took place at the embassy of the People's Republic of China in 
Ukraine on 4 January. Yuriy Rylach, deputy minister of foreign 
affairs of Ukraine, who was present at the reception, expressed 
the hope for further fruitful development of interstate 
relations. Ivan Drach, chairman of the "Ukraine" society; Petro 
Myroshnykov, chairman of the Ukrainian-Chinese friendship 
society; and Valentyn Lipatov, deputy minister of foreign 
affairs of Ukraine, were also present at the reception. Zhang 
Zhen, ambassador of the People's Republic of China in Ukraine, 
thanked the guests from ministries and departments of Ukraine, 
the active members of the Ukrainian-Chinese friendship society, 
and representatives from business circles of the capital and 
from the diplomatic corps for their attention and cooperation.

  [Editorial Report] Kiev TV-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1900 GMT on 14 December carries its regular "UTN" 
program which contains a report on the reaction of Ukrainian 
People's Deputies to the results of elections in Russia. 
  Head of the Democratic Party, People's Deputy V. Yavorivskiy 
says that now Ukraine has Zhirinovskiy's Russia, not Yeltsin's 
Russia, as a neighbor. He says that this should be a serious 
lesson to Ukraine. He then says that even though he believes 
that there are no forces similar to Zhirinovskiy's forces in 
Ukraine, all the Ukrainian forces should ask the people of 
Ukraine to elect sensible people to the Parliament. 
  People's Deputy B. Oleynik stresses the point that Yeltsin 
himself and his forces brought Zhirinovskiy to victory, just 
like Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to victory. 
  People's Deputy Yu. Gnatkevich says that lesson no. 1 is 
that 
the Ukraine should implement reforms rather than mark time, 
otherwise the people will vote for any dictator or a demagogue. 
Lesson no. 2 is that exhaustive information about elections 
should be provided, because people are confused and can elect 
someone who simply gives good promises. Lesson no. 3 is that 
democrats should unite on the basis of a common platform and 
should form a single bloc that would unite all those who support 
reforms, private property, and denationalization. Another lesson 
is that elections in Russia showed that people can access power 
in Russia on the basis of slogans proclaiming restoration of the 
foundations of a great imperial power. 
  This is followed by a commentary over visuals by Yu. Gorovoy 
on the same subject. Reporter comments on territorial claims 
made by Zhirinovskiy in the course of his election campaign, 
noting that he already refers to Ukraine as "small Russia" and 
does not hide his intention to restore Russia within the 
boundaries of the former empire. Reporter then says that Ukraine 
should remember the "mistakes of its great neighbor", which are 
as follows. The central bodies of power were completely detached 
from provinces. The economic program has proved itself only in 
theory. As for the population, it could not endure social 
problems associated with transition from a planned economy to a 
market economy. The main reason for the success of the Reds and 
the Brownshirts is lack of unity between democratic parties, 
which failed to recognize a common enemy due to internal 
discord. If Ukraine wants to preserve its independence, it 
should recognize this enemy, evaluate it, and develop a process 
to ensure formation of a strong and healthy Parliament and the 
government.

name, Ukrainian Liberal Democrats have nothing in common with 
Zhirinovskiy's party. "In the near future we want to appeal with 
an initiative to the Liberal International, which unites parties 
from the whole world that have a liberal democratic orientation, 
to deprive the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia of its name, 
because being chauvinistic in content, this party has 
discredited the ideas of liberalism and democracy, said 
Volodymyr Klymchuk.

<F P=106> [Report by Bohdan Kushnir, MOLOD UKRAYINY special </F>
correspondent, from Mostyskyy Rayon in Lvov Oblast: "Major of 
Ukraine's Security Service Anatoliy Lysenko Celebrated the New 
Year in a Polish Prison"] 
  [Text] Relations between the special services of 
neighboring countries have always had their own traditions: 
They may be good-neighborly, even friendly, or, at least, 
colleagues may always find a common language. The problem lies 
in what they are after. Traditions are only just taking shape in 
the relations between Poland and Ukraine, because, until quite 
recently, the two countries were under control of the almighty 
KGB, and their special services danced to the same tune. The 
history of these relations has only started to take shape, 
although not in the best spirit. Its first page is the fate of 
Anatoliy Lysenko, major of the Mostyskyy Rayon (in Lvov Oblast) 
Department of Ukraine's Security Service. 
  On 23 August 1993, the major of Ukrainian special services 
was arrested on the territory of Poland and accused of 
espionage. It is already the fourth month that Anatoliy has 
been under investigation. The trial will be held soon. It is a 
strange case -- the major was arrested not far from the border. 
On his trip to Poland, Anatoliy was accompanied by his whole 
family -- wife, student daughter, and a little son. He did not 
receive permission to leave from his authorities -- for lack of 
time. Doctors insisted on the fourth operation on his son, and 
the parents decided to seek the advice of an experienced Polish 
specialist. In addition, there was nobody he could ask 
permission from -- the chief was away on leave, and his deputies 
were afraid to take the responsibility upon themselves. The 
Lysenko family decided to go to Rzeszow on their own, though 
they did have corresponding documents for crossing the border. 
  Nowhere in the history of special services worldwide will 
one 
find a precedent in which a whole family would be engaged in 
spying. The version maintaining that Major Lysenko collected 
intelligence information seems, to put it mildly, doubtful not 
only to professionals. It is a different matter that the Poles, 
taking advantage of the distress of the Lysenko family, did 
everything in order to lure the major to their territory. The 
first officer, who was in charge of the Mostyskyy Customs House 
and who, apparently, ensured free border crossings for more than 
one cargo, could not but interest his Polish colleagues. The 
Mostyskyy Customs House is the gate to Western Europe, and 
officers of the local department of Ukraine's Security Service 
are a Klondike of intelligence information. The "proofs" of 
espionage about which Lysenko's wife writes in her appeal to the 
Ukrainian president, are ridiculous. Lysenko allegedly asked one 
Pole to bring a few newspapers from Poland; another time, he 
asked about who was going to head the religious community in 
Przemysl and when the clergyman there would be replaced. 
Finally, the most serious accusation -- he helped a Polish 
citizen to bypass Customs. Based upon a testimony of their 
citizen, Polish special services charged the major with 
espionage and applied to him an article of the Criminal Code 
envisaging between five and 15 years imprisonment or capital 
punishment. 
  Although, Major Lysenko has yet another choice -- to betray 
his fatherland. The Poles are offering him a job in their 
special services, to bring his family, and adopt Polish 
citizenship. 
  Meanwhile, Ukraine's Security Service, having abandoned 
their 
colleague to the mercy of fate, maintains calm and pretends that 
nothing has happened. The Poles show greater interest in 
Lysenko's case, because they already repeatedly hinted that 
Ukrainian leaders should come to his rescue. Judging by 
numerous hints, it is not just a matter of Anatoliy Lysenko's 
fate. It appears that we are dealing here with the worst 
variant of relations between special services, where the rule 
"tit for tat" is in effect. Consequently, Ukrainian special 
services pushed their Polish colleagues to a decisive step, or 
else the Poles decided that attack was the best type of defense. 
As a result, Ukraine's Security Service Major Anatoliy Lysenko 
celebrates the coming of the New Year in a Polish prison, his 
wife Olena haunts the thresholds of high-ranking officials, who 
can only help by appointing a lawyer. Perhaps, they do not want 
to help? It only remains for us to wonder what kind of logic 
the Polish special services adhered to by picturing a modest 
rayon official as the greatest Ukrainian spy. It is possible 
that Anatoliy does not even have an idea about this. Now, his 
colleagues will welcome him as a hero....

  [Text] In December, a meeting was held in Khyriv in Lvov 
Oblast between representatives of the Lvov Railroad and the 
National Railroads of Poland. The meeting was devoted to 
Ukraine's repeated requests to initiate direct railroad links 
between the Ukrainian juncture of Khyriv and Kroscienko in 
Poland. This would grant Ukraine additional access to Germany, 
Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Having spent 222 
million karbovanetses on preparations for this undertaking, 
Ukraine planned to open the route on 31 December 1993. 
  However, the Polish side declared that the lack of 
appropriate infrastructure for customs and border troops would 
hinder the process. The Poles also did not agree to operate a 
joint customs and border checkpoint on Ukrainian territory. 
Following this declaration, Lvov Railroad Deputy Manager 
Tkachuk threatened to block the Polish Przemysl-Kroscienko route 
stretching in part via the Ukrainian station of Khyriv. 
According to MOLODA HALYCHYNA, the threat worked and the Polish 
side gave in. 
  Volodymyr Kulyk, head of the International Routes Department 
deemed as "absolute nonsense" the report on Tkachuk's ultimatum. 
According to him, the route will open no sooner than 31 May 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Azerbaijan: Martyrs Needed"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- Former Azerbaijan President Abulfaz 
Elchibey has once again loomed up on the political scene. 
Admittedly, now as a national martyr. To put it bluntly, this 
has been accomplished in a fairly original manner: Leading 
opposition publications have submitted for the public verdict a 
grand dedicatory anthem urging the nation not to stone 
yesterday's idol. 
  The idea of his being stoned is a patent exaggeration. The 
purpose of the article is simple: A People's Front leader with 
a tarnished reputation makes the opposition unappealing, and 
without that appeal there is every indication that it will be 
hard to revive its lost image. Especially since parties and 
their leaders do not currently enjoy popular support. That is 
why they are trying to draw public attention to their "own 
persona." This is the light in which one should view the rumors 
of the alleged attempt on Elchibey's life, as well as opposition 
newspapers' articles against President Geydar Aliyev. 
  Numerous articles are targeting the president's team. They 
interpret the failures on the Karabakh front as demonstrating 
the head of state's inability to ensure the people's safety and 
the hard lot suffered by the 1 million refugees is presented as 
the inevitable consequence of the "new Aliyev's" political 
course. 
  According to one observer, the "newspaper war" is equal to 
the Karabakh war. The president's meeting with the leaders of 
political parties revealed an extremely dangerous trend: 
Parties have become isolated from the masses and gotten carried 
away by what is just political intrigue in the newspapers. In 
an attempt to shout one another down 200 newspapers are vying in 
denouncing the authorities for the most grievous offenses and 
trying to outdo their opponents in terms of "perspicacity." 
  The hopes that Gaydar Aliyev would close down the political 
publications in anger have not been realized. In this respect 
the statement by a U.S. State Department spokesman, who rushed 
to shout menacingly across the ocean about alleged violation of 
press freedom in Azerbaijan, can only be compared to a "false 
alarm." No one in the republic intends to ban opposition 
newspapers. 
  Things banned by the law on the press have been banned. 
Newspaper publishers and editors have been given strict 
warnings: Wartime conditions have to be taken into consideration 
-- they must not spread panic, engage in disinformation, or 
divulge military secrets. To that end the National Assembly has 
introduced military censorship. Georgia, incidentally, has done 
the same in the past. 
  The law says that any fabrication may cause a publication to 
be suspended for a month. If they do not like various actions 
taken by the authorities, they can go ahead and criticize 
individual points and individuals based on facts, but not on 
fabrication. 
  However, there is nothing mysterious about the articles 
carrying various rumors. There are definite forces behind each 
"custom-made" article: Some are dying for power, some are 
afraid of taking responsibility for crimes committed. After 
all, a number of the recent denunciations in the republic relate 
to thefts on a particularly grand scale: the illegal export of 
hard currency, machinations with grain and food purchases, arms 
dealing. 
  In a word, the "newspaper war" is least of all to do with an 
upsurge in political activity. Many political scientists think 
that the "unmasking" of every smart operator is accompanied by a 
"newspaper fusillade." But this time the opposition has 
miscalculated. The concentration of fire on "headquarters" has 
failed to hit its target: The authorities have not flinched, 
and the people have not rushed off to rallies. 
  As for the dedicatory anthem to the ex-president, "Don't 
Stone an Idol," this work has disappeared without trace. A 
popular singer has translated it into English and sings it 
country-and-western style with a saxophone and flute 
accompaniment. It has been a real hit. As they say, it is just 
one step from the sublime to the ridiculous.

  [Text] The first plant in Azerbaijan for the production of 
gold ingots with a fineness of 999.9 will be constructed in Baku 
in cooperation with the Moscow "Geotep" institute. 
  The Muscovites have developed the technological part of the 
project for the future enterprise and handed over the blueprints 
to representatives of the client -- the "Azerkyzyl" 
("Azerzoloto") state company. This was announced by "Azerkyzyl" 
Vice President Valis Ismaylov. "Geotep," he noted, has assumed 
the purchase of specialized equipment and its delivery to the 
construction site. 
  Predicted gold reserves in Azerbaijan are assessed at 1,500 
tonnes. At the same time other precious metals, silver in 
particular, will be mined with it. 
  The planned capacity of the first gold extracting plant is 
five tonnes of ingots a year. It will be possible to reach this 
level three to four years after the launch of the enterprise.

  [Text] Moscow, 5 January -- Zviad Gamsakhurdia, 
ex-president of Georgia, committed suicide at 0030 on 31 
December 1993 [2130 GMT on 30 December] in a region of western 
Georgia. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned today from the Chechen 
president's press service that Zviad Gamsakhurdia's wife Manana 
had noted that the place where Zviad Gamsakhurdia spent that 
night had been surrounded by unknown persons. According to her 
version, "the Georgian authorities had information about 
Gamsakhurdia's death but carefully concealed it and are still 
concealing it to this moment." 
  A statement issued in Groznyy today by Zviad Gamsakhurdia's 
press service notes that a few minutes before his death he said 
that "he is committing this act in full awareness as a sign of 
protest against the existing regime in Georgia and of his 
inability, as president, to improve the situation and to restore

suicide 
on the night of 30 to 31 December 1993 in one of the western

  [Text] Former Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the 
country's first democratically-elected head of state, shot 
himself dead at a hillside village in western Georgia on 
December 31 while being surrounded by members of the 
paramilitary Mkhedrioni unit, his wife Manana told Interfax. 
  She said Gamsakhurdia and part of his supporters were 
ambushed in a village but she was not told about its location. 
  Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said her husband had told his supporters 
to 
blow themselves up with grenades in the face of an overpowering 
pro-government unit. But he later shot himself dead "not 
wanting to cause anguish and pain to his associates," she said. 
  Gamsakhurdia said she was told about her husband's death 
only 
on Wednesday. 
  Gamsakhurdia's death puts an end to the national liberation 
movement in Georgia, which will forever remain in slavery, 
Manana said in tears. She said her husband was Georgia's last 
hope. 
  She said she would like her husband to be buried next to his 
father's grave in the courtyard of their house in Tbilisi, 
something she said the government would never allow. 
  The 54-year-old Gamsakhurdia took over the country's 
national 
democratic movement in 1989 following the death of its leader 
and well-known human rights campaigner Merab Kostava. In the 
same year, pro-democracy groups forged a "Round Table-Free 
Georgia" alliance which won an overwhelming majority in 
Georgia's free elections a year later, its first for many years. 
  In 1991, Gamsakhurdia became the country's first 
democratically-elected head of state after gaining 97 percent of 
the vote. However, he was accused of dictatorship and overthrown 
in December 1991, after the anti-government forces mounted an 
attack on the presidential palace. Gamsakhurdia left it and 
went into hiding in the Chechen republic early in January 1992. 
However, the former president returned to western Georgia last 
fall to take charge of troops loyal to him.

  [Text] Citing information received from Chechnya and a 
statement by the Georgian ex-president's wife, Manana Archvadze, 
international media reported that the former president of 
Georgia committed suicide in a village of Zugdidi Rayon on 5 
January. However, the official authorities and appropriate 
bodies in Zugdidi, Tsalenjikha, and adjacent rayons do not 
possess such information. 
  A high-ranking officer in the Georgian Security Ministry 
believes that the information about Gamsakhurdia's suicide must 
be thoroughly checked. One of the high-ranking officers in the 
Georgian Security Ministry who did not want to reveal his 
identity stated that the information about the Georgian 
ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia's suicide in a populated 
location in western Georgia on 31 December was based only on 
rumors and must therefore be thoroughly checked. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, the officer said that three 
days ago Security Ministry officials in Zugdidi got hold of 
leaflets carrying Zviad Gamsakhurdia's address to the Georgian 
people in which he urged them not to surrender and to continue 
the struggle against the Shevardnadze junta. 
  The officer also believes that Zviad Gamsakhurdia is not a 
man capable of committing suicide. 
  There are also other versions. According to reports from the 
IPRINDA agency, a split occurred over the new year among the 
former president's supporters in Chechnya. It developed into an 
armed clash, as a result of which Zviad Gamsakhurdia was wounded 
and died several days later. 
  The Georgian leadership does not possess information to 
confirm or deny these reports. However, since there are such 
reports, the republic's Prosecutor's Office and other competent 
bodies have been entrusted with the task of carrying out an 
investigation. The public will be informed about its results. 
  In connection with this incident, Chechen Vice President 
(Zelimkhan Yantardiyev), Foreign Minister (Shamsudin Yusip), and 
the president's adviser arrived in Tbilisi today, 5 January. 
  [Signed] The press secretariat of the head of state

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vitaliy Gordiyenko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan -- Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze 
told an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the telephone from his office 
shortly after 1:00 A.M. this morning: Whatever the truth about 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia's death, it is of no great importance to the 
situation in Georgia. 
  Asked about the possible consequences of Gamsakhurdia's 
death, Eduard Shevardnadze said that he "would rather 
Gamsakhurdia stayed alive." He explained: "It was clear to us 
that the former president had long been a political corpse. 
This is the reason the Georgian leadership decided not to 
physically destroy him or his supporters." 
  The Georgian leader continued: "Moreover, many of the ex- 
president's supporters who had been taken prisoners were set 
free after the western regions of the republic were recaptured." 
Eduard Shevardnadze emphasized that "the majority of his 
supporters had dissociated themselves from him." 
  Eduard Shevardnadze did not give a final version of the 
death 
or suicide of the 54-year-old Zviad Gamsakhurdia, though the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent asked for one. 
  He said: "The Georgian leaders learned about this from 
Chechen sources, and it was confirmed by a Chechen delegation 
which came to Tbilisi on 5 January." The Georgian head of state 
said: "We immediately got in touch with [people in] places where 
Gamsakhurdia was likely to be staying, and with his wife Manana 
who is in Groznyy, but it is hard to tell whether it really 
happened this or that way." 
  At the same time, Eduard Shevardnadze suggested that 
Gamsakhurdia might have died in a conflict between some people 
in his entourage because "he started getting in their way and 
they were capable of such a step."

  [Text] The trial of Anzor Sharmaidze, 21, charged with the 
murder of Fred Woodruff, an official of the American Embassy in 
Georgia, began in Tbilisi on Wednesday [5 January]. 
  Before the trial the lawyer of the unemployed defendant made 
a statement claiming the murder was a tragic accident. 
  The trial taking place at the Supreme Court is attended by 
the vice-consul of the American embassy. 
  Woodruff was killed last summer on a highway near Tbilisi. 
Investigators arrived at the conclusion an attempt was made to 
stop the diplomat's car for the purpose of robbery. As the car 
driven by the chief of Shevardnadze's security did not stop, 
fire was opened at it. 
  According to many sources, Woodruff was a CIA officer. The 
chief of the organization James Woolsey came to Tbilisi to 
escort the dead body back home.

  [Text] Zurab Dvalia, IPRINDA news agency correspondent, 
reports from Georgia by telephone. 
  [Dvalia] A constituent meeting of the Abkhazian regional 
branch of the Union of Georgian Citizens took place in Tbilisi 
today. The union is headed by Eduard Shevardnadze. The 
speakers noted the need to unite all forces in order to attain 
stability and order in the republic. Head of State Eduard 
Shevardnadze himself spoke at the meeting. He gave a brief 
analysis of the sociopolitical situation that had taken shape. 
Naturally, he paid special attention to the Abkhazian problem. 
For the first time over the few months since Georgian troops 
had left Abkhazia, Shevardnadze openly said that, apart from 
everything else, a large-scale betrayal near the Katorskiy 
bridge in Abkhazia was one of the main reasons for the defeat in 
Abkhazia. Also, this betrayal took place in Ochamchira Rayon, 
as well as in Sukhumi, where whole battalions were often 
withdrawn from advanced positions without command agreement. 
  Shevardnadze openly accused Tengiz Kitovani, former 
republican defense minister, and General Paata Datunashvili, 
current first deputy defense minister, of handing over great 
amounts of weapons, ammunition, and hardware to the armed 
formations of the ex- president's supporters. 
  The head of state noted that today's Georgia did not have, 
in 
fact, a unified disciplined army since the available armed 
forces cannot be regarded as such. Also, he said that in the 
next few days he intended to issue several decrees aimed at 
forming new unified armed forces but he did not elaborate on the 
subject. 
  At the same time, it has become known from unofficial 
sources 
that serious changes are being prepared in the top echelons of 
the Georgian Defense Ministry.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 5 TASS -- In today's interview with 
national television, Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze 
cited the republic's entering the Commonwealth of Independent 
States as one of the last year's most important events. 
  Analysing the current political and economic situation in 
Georgia, Shevardnadze listed three principal factors which he 
believes should determine joint activities within the CIS 
framework. These are strengthening the economy, fighting 
separatist sentiments and averting a threat of dictatorship. 
  The Georgian leader said the Commonwealth of Independent 
States is presently charged with a historical mission, and "if 
all the countries work in agreement in these three directions, 
if we efficiently fight these evils, all citizens of 
newly-independent states will feel the goodness resulting from 
our unity."

  [Text] The mass media has spread reports about Vladislav 
Ardzinba's radio address. According to these reports, Ardzinba 
said he is rather skeptical about Georgian-Abkhaz consultations 
set for 11 January. In this connection, the Georgian Foreign 
Ministry has issued a statement which says, in particular: 
  Ardzinba's radio address shows not only his skepticism, but 
is also an attempt to poison the atmosphere in advance of the 
forthcoming [Geneva] talks and, if possible, to wreck them. His 
judgements are a testimony of this. He says Abkhazia is no 
longer part of Georgia, that Abkhazia has won the war, that 
conditions are set by the winners, and that it is only possible 
to talk about a treaty between Abkhazia and Georgia as two equal 
entities. 
  The history of the conflict in Abkhazia has many examples 
proving that Ardzinba and his supporters are used to trampling 
on and scrapping agreements they have signed themselves. It is 
enough to mention the fate of the Moscow and Sochi agreements. 
Such perfidy has become for them an effective and common means 
of carrying out their intentions. 
  In his New Year address to Abkhazians, Georgian head of 
state 
Eduard Shevardnadze said: 
  The democratic Georgian state is giving you not only a 
guarantee of preserving your national identity but also a 
guarantee of development and improvement, as well as appropriate 
political, economic, and other guarantees. We promise this to 
these people, as we do to anybody else who lives in Georgia. We 
promise them freedom, civil rights guarantees, and anything else 
which is accepted in the modern civilized world. 
  This was part of the statement by the Georgian Foreign 
Ministry, the full text of which will be published in the press.

  [Text] Sukhumi January 5 TASS -- A delegation of the 
Russian Federation led by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris 
Pastukhov arrived in Sukhumi on Wednesday. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS Pastukhov said that the 
delegation arrived in Abkhazia to familiarise itself with the 
situation in Abkhazia on the eve of Georgian-Abkhazian talks due 
to begin in Geneva on January 11. 
  A meeting between Pastukhov and Vladislav Ardzinba was held 
in the residence of the Abkhazian parliament chairman. After 
the talks with Abkhazian leaders the Russian delegation met with 
the people of the Abkhazian capital Sukhumi and visited 
districts damaged during military operations. 
  Pastukhov positively assessed efforts made by the Abkhazian 
government to eliminate the after-effects of the war and improve 
the social position of the Abkhazian population. 
  Pastukhov expressed the hope for the speediest solution of 
problems connected with the return of refugees who fled the 
republic during the war. 
  On Thursday, the Russian delegation is leaving for Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article by Mamuka Dzebisashvili: "Why Were We Defeated in </F>
Abkhazia?"] 
  [Text] The first stage of the Abkhazian conflict has ended 
with the defeat of the Georgians. However, as has been said 
more than once, the war has not ended and it is only a matter of 
time before it begins again. Consequently, the renewal of 
combat actions in Abkhazia is unavoidable. Therefore, it would 
be better for us to take into account those military mistakes or 
technical failures that took place during the course of the 
conflict. In spite of the self-sacrifice of Georgian fighters, 
these errors were, to a significant degree, responsible for the 
defeat of the Georgian Army and the loss first of Sukhumi and 
then the whole of Abkhazia. 
<H5>  Without a State Army: </H5>
  The process of forming a single Georgian army has been going 
on for several years now. However, almost nothing has been done 
in this respect. A hastily formed, untrained, undisciplined 
army will not be able to win a war. Any person with a military 
education knows that an army is formed through incessant 
training at barracks. In this respect, the situation is bad. 
The barracks, firing ranges, and military bases that Russia 
transferred to the Georgian Ministry of Defense are in a 
demolished state. Many are, in general, abandoned military 
installations that do not have the appropriate military 
contingent and that have been plundered by the local population. 
However, once repaired and provided with elementary defense, 
they will play a decisive role in the formation of the Georgian 
Army. There are significant problems within the military 
commissariats that are unable to call up the necessary number of 
young persons for service in the armed forces. The reason is 
simple: The commissariat is a bureaucratic body. Due to 
thousands of "arrangements" and machinations, conscripts have 
easily been able to avoid compulsory military service. If this 
body is not reformed or replaced by another structure, we will 
not be able to achieve the desired results. We have to create 
an institution that will punish with the full severity of the 
law those persons who avoid service in the armed forces. 
  The lack of officer cadres remains an unresolved problem. On 
the initiative of the Ministry of Defense, Georgian and 
non-Georgian officers serving in the Russian Army have started 
to be brought into the national army. However, unless there is 
an improvement in the social situation of officers, this 
priceless treasure will slip out of our hands. 
  The existence of armed formations remains an insurmountable 
barrier to the creation of an army. These subunits are not 
accountable to anyone and, in a number of cases, appear almost 
as bandit detachments. It has been repeatedly stated that they 
are to join the official armed forces but, in reality, nothing 
has changed. Quite recently, the republic's defense minister 
again issued an order on the necessity of all military 
formations becoming part of a single army and on providing the 
sides that participated in the Abkhazian conflict with weapons 
and technical equipment. Naturally, the nonexistence of a 
trained army played a big role in the defeat in Abkhazia. 
However, the antiquity of Georgian military equipment and 
weapons had decisive importance. At the initial stage of the 
conflict, the Abkhazians had a qualitative rather than 
quantitative advantage in equipment over their opponents. 
However, following violation of the Sochi agreement [signed on 
27 July 1993], they also had quantitative superiority. 
  Armored equipment: The existing conflicts on the 
territory of the former Soviet Union have clearly shown the 
importance of armored equipment in conditions of war. In 
today's conditions, having modern armored forces that have been 
tactically trained means being halfway toward winning a war. 
Unfortunately, Georgia has nothing to boast about regarding its 
armored equipment. Of all the former Soviet republics, Georgia 
was the one that received the most antiquated and worthless 
equipment. Whereas Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan 
received modern armored vehicles (T-72, T-80, BTR-80, and so 
forth) from the Russian Army, Georgia, on the other hand, was 
given tanks and APC's (T-54, T-55, T-62, BTR-60BP, and BRDM) 
dating from World War II and its aftermath. 
  During the initial stage of the Abkhazian war, the Georgian 
side had a big advantage (in the main, quantitative) as far as 
armored equipment was concerned. However, the situation 
gradually changed. The Abkhazians had in their weaponry: T-72, 
T-55, BTR-80, MT-LB, and so forth. The defenders of Gagra and 
Sukhumi were astonished by the qualities of the so-called 
"uncapturable" T-72 tank. It was impossible to destroy it with 
small-caliber guns and the RPG-7 and "Mukha" [antitank] rocket 
launchers. The IFV-2 also worked well for the Abkhazian side, a 
vehicle which, for the most part, is an improved version of the 
IFV-1 in possession of the Georgians, the only difference being 
that it has a semi-automatic gun (while the IFV-1 is still 
loading a shell, its new modification manages to fire 10). 
  Of the new Russian weapons that were used by the Abkhazians, 
it is worth singling out the antitank guided missile. This 
missile was responsible for destroying a large number of tanks 
on the Georgian side. These were fired, in the main, from the 
[seismic] laboratory in Zemo Eshera. 
  The importance of armored equipment is also borne out by the 
opinion of the majority of the defenders of Sukhumi, according 
to which the city would not have fallen if they had possessed 
tanks. 
  Artillery: At the start of the conflict, the 
Abkhazians found themselves in a difficult situation as they 
practically had no artillery. They had innumerable automatic 
weapons, machine guns, rocket launchers, but no cannons and 
howitzers; by rarely using 85 mm D-44-type cannons, it was 
impossible to destroy the many Georgian tanks and, in general, 
inflict serious damage upon the enemy. However, as time passed, 
the Abkhazians acquired all the modern artillery currently to be 
found on the territory of the former USSR. Their weaponry 
included 122 mm D-30 howitzers and 152 mm self-propelled 
artillery systems (2S-3 "Akatsiya" and 2S-1 "Mimoza"), and they 
also later acquired the so- called "Grad" launcher vehicle, 
which is capable of salvo fire and has a huge destructive force. 
  The Georgian Armed Forces did not lag behind the enemy as 
far 
as artillery was concerned; as a result of the selfless struggle 
of artillerymen, Sukhumi escaped being taken on several 
occasions. 
  The plethora of artillery and the lack of qualifications of 
those operating it (thanks to Russian military instructors, the 
combat capabilities of Abkhazian artillery significantly 
increased during the final period of the conflict) conditioned 
the destructive and devastating character of combat actions. 
This was shown by the burned-down city of Sukhumi and the 
destroyed villages in Ochamchire rayon. 
  Aviation: Georgian aviation was produced, in the 
main, at the former Dimitrov 31st Aviation Factory (Su-25 
fighters) although the Georgian Ministry of Defense did receive 
a squadron of strike [damrtqmeli] helicopters (Mi-24 and Mi-8 
MT). Our aviation took an active part in the Abkhazian war but 
it also incurred big losses. By using antiaircraft missile 
systems, the Abkhazians succeeded in shooting down several 
planes and helicopters (Su-25, Mi-24, and Mi-8 MT). Such losses 
incurred by Georgian aviation are wholly understandable since we 
had neither fighter-interceptors (Su-27, MiG-29) nor combat 
radar systems, as a result of which our aviation became an easy 
prey for Abkhazian antiaircraft defense and fighters. 
  It is a joke to speak about Abkhazian aviation. It would be 
more correct for us to speak about Russian aviation that was 
hired by the Abkhazians and that actively participated in the 
conflict: Su-25's bombed and reconnoitered Georgian positions 
and Mi-24's also frequently took part in battles; however, it 
was the Su-25's that carefully protected the aforementioned 
fighting vehicles. In spite of the high caliber of Russian 
pilots and the poor capabilities of Georgian antiaircraft 
defense, the Georgians did succeed in shooting down Mi-24's, 
Mi-8 MT's, and, most importantly, Su-25's. 
  Antiaircraft Defense: It would not be an 
exaggeration to say that antiaircraft defense brought the 
greatest advantage to the sides fighting in the Abkhazian war. 
This was particularly true in the case of the Abkhazians. By 
means of the "Igla," "Strela," and "Osa," portable antiaircraft 
missile systems and the "Su-25" [as published] "Shilka" 
self-propelled antiaircraft gun, they were able to neutralize 
Georgian aviation. The "Osa" was particularly effective in this 
respect. It should be said here that, according to certain 
sources of information, the latest antiaircraft systems located 
in Gudauta were also used in battles. 
  It is true that the antiaircraft defense of the Georgian 
Armed Forces was not equipped technically to the same level as 
that of the Abkhazians. Nevertheless, it also achieved certain 
results. The date 19 March 1993 represents a landmark in the 
history of our antiaircraft defense. On this day, a Su-27 
fighter-interceptor (tail number 11) belonging to the Russian 
Army and piloted by Major Vatslav Shipko was shot down. In 
addition, several assault aircraft and strike helicopters 
belonging to the Russian Army and based at the Babushera 
military airfield were destroyed. 
  If we do not take into account barges and "Kometa" 
[launches] 
on which heavy-caliber machine guns, guns, and "Grad" launchers 
were installed, the sides involved in the fighting did not have 
navies. By using these means, it was impossible to carry out 
precise bombing of the opposing side's positions and it resulted 
only in destruction and the killing of the peaceful population. 
  Such an Abkhazian navy presented a danger for Georgian 
aviation as they had portable antiaircraft systems on the 
launches, which enabled them to destroy several Su-25's 
belonging to the Georgian Armed Forces and several passenger 
aircraft belonging to the "Orbi" Aviation Company. 
  At the same time, it was established that vessels belonging 
to the Russian Black Sea Fleet were participating directly in 
battles on the Abkhazian side. For example, the combatant ship 
"Bezukoriznennyy" fought against the Georgians. 
  The one thing for which the Abkhazians made superb use of 
their so-called navy was landing an amphibious assault force, 
which caused considerable damage to Georgian military formations. 
  Fire arms and rocket launchers: In this war, 
different types of Kalashnikov assault rifles [AK] were widely 
used. The Kalashnikov improved assault rifle (7.62 mm) [AKM] 
proved to be particularly effective. A 5.45 mm bullet from the 
AK-74 and AKS [folding-stock assault rifle] changed its 
trajectory when fired in cornfields or mandarin groves in 
contrast to a bullet fired from the AKS [as published] that did 
not change its trajectory. In this respect, the Abkhazians were 
at an advantage. They were armed, in the main, with AKM's and a 
rocket launcher of the same make that was unrivalled in street 
battles. 
  Of the Kalashnikov assault rifles, one can single out the 
7.62 mm Kalashnikov medium machine gun and the 12.7 mm 
Degtyarev-Shpagin heavy machine gun. These weapons represented 
a big force in battles in forests and ravines. 
  Snipers also played their part in the fighting. They used 
the Dragunov and Tokarev semiautomatic sniping rifles. It is 
significant that there were many female snipers on the Abkhazian 
side. 
  One of the "heroes" of the Georgian-Abkhazian armed conflict 
was the rocket launcher. On account of geographical conditions, 
it proved to be the most effective weapon in this war. It was 
used both to destroy armored equipment and to bomb positions. 
The Abkhazians undoubtedly held the advantage regarding this 
type of weapon. The sides involved in the fighting had the 
RPG-7, RPG-18, "Mukha," RPG-22, "Osa," and the 30 mm AGS 
[expansion unknown] rocket launcher. 
  Proceeding from all the aforementioned, one can draw the 
following conclusion: The Georgian defeat in Abkhazia resulted 
from having an army that was untrained and lacking in discipline 
at an elementary level and having antiquated military-technical 
capabilities compared with the Abkhazian side. Therefore, if we 
want to achieve any kind of military success in the future, we 
should start eradicating these shortcomings now.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bohdan Horyn, deputy chairman of the Supreme </F>
Council commission for foreign relations, by Myroslav Levytskyy; 
place and date not given: "Ukraine Takes Historic Steps, But 
Russia Plans Drastic Measures in Turn"] 
  [Text] Among the deputies who worked on a committee 
for ratification of the START I agreement was Bohdan Horyn, 
deputy chairman of the commission for foreign relations, who 
agreed to comment on the Supreme Council's resolution of START I 
and other related questions. 
  [Horyn] The Supreme Council resolution ratifying the START I 
treaty and Lisbon Protocol was an historic moment in helping 
address the issue of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. 
Ukraine has earnestly been preparing for the adoption of this 
important document. However, following the withdrawal of 
tactical nuclear weapons from Ukraine, this step has not been 
properly understood by other countries. 
  I want to stress that the Supreme Council resolution of 18 
November has several important points. Ukraine, being one of 
the inheritors to the USSR, ratified the treaty with provisos 
made for the USSR, which obliged the latter to reduce 36 percent 
of warhead carriers and 42 percent of all warheads. Ukraine 
became a party to the treaty after the disintegration of the 
USSR; it signed the Lisbon Protocol with one particular item: 
Article 5 has put Ukraine within a framework that would have 
been very tight if the protocol had been ratified in its 
original version. Therefore, the resolution states that the 
Lisbon Protocol has been ratified with the exclusion of Article 
5. 
  Article 5 provides for Ukraine joining the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty with the status of a nonnuclear state. 
Taking into account that Ukraine keeps nuclear weapons on its 
territory and that they are Ukrainian property, Ukraine's 
joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear 
state, while at the same time retaining its nuclear weapons, 
would be an illogical step and cause a misunderstanding in the 
world community. Reassuring the world that Ukraine joined the 
treaty as a nonnuclear state, while keeping nuclear weapons on 
its territory, we would not quite be in line with logic. 
Therefore, according to the Constitution, the final say had to 
come from the Supreme Council. The Lisbon Protocol cannot be a 
binding document unless ratified. 
  I believe the assertions of individual officials that 
Ukraine 
will destroy all its nuclear weapons without condition are a 
little premature. Such assertions are unfounded. There were 
two opinions during the preparations for ratifying START I. The 
deputies who prepared the resolution pressed for determining the 
percentage ratio of nuclear reduction as a next step toward 
nonnuclear status. The executive structures expressed the 
opinion that the percentages should not be fixed because this 
may complicate the understanding of Ukraine's position by other 
states. The stance of individual representatives of executive 
power has been dictated by promises and assertions that they 
made during numerous interviews and meetings with high-ranking 
foreign officials. This obliged them to defend their position 
during the preparation of the Supreme Council draft resolution. 
  [Levytskyy] The last word was left for the Supreme 
Council, so why were diplomats in such a hurry to make 
promises? 
  [Horyn] Diplomacy is often put in a complicated position of 
choice. Since Ukraine has unceasingly been pressed by certain 
countries, particularly by Russia, executive branch 
representatives were forced to make promises under pressure. 
  [Levytskyy] Still, at one news conference, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk stated that, within the START I 
framework, all nuclear weapons are subject to destruction. 
  [Horyn] I think that the deputy minister misspoke. The 
START I agreement was signed by the United States and USSR. 
Ukraine has joined it after the downfall of the Soviet Union. 
Consequently, the norms of reduction were in the competence of 
the Supreme Council. Taking into account that there were some 
mistakes made in the initial stage of Ukraine's path to 
nonnuclear status, this act has not been legalized by 
appropriate documents. In the second stage, as I believe, 
previous mistakes were noted and the possibility of 
implementation was examined. We have a grounded document with 
all the complexities taken into account. These documents give 
witness to the maturity of political thinking and the new level 
of caution exercised by the deputy body when adopting important 
political resolutions. 
  [Levytskyy] What was the position of the manager 
body [dyrektorskyy korpus] with regard to this question? 
  [Horyn] The so-called deputy majority has undergone many 
changes in its attitude toward nuclear weapons. While adopting 
the Declaration of State Sovereignty, the managers said that 
Ukraine should not give away its nuclear weapons to Russia 
because these weapons are of great material value and constitute 
a reliable guarantee of our security. 
  [Levytskyy] However, along with this assessment of the 
problem, the Supreme Council has put forth declarations on our 
status as a nonnuclear state? 
  [Horyn] The declarations on Ukraine's nonnuclear status have 
exerted great influence on quickening the international 
recognition of Ukraine. It seems to me that if we had chosen a 
different path, the making of our statehood would have met with 
many more difficulties. 
  However, the Declaration of State Sovereignty and the 
Supreme 
Soviet resolutions were the very documents which expressed 
Ukraine's willingness to become a nonnuclear state in the 
future. These documents cannot be interpreted as obligations. 
Ukraine's first international obligation to reduce nuclear 
weapons was a Supreme Council resolution of 18 November 1993. 
  [Levytskyy] This question is assessed by the world in 
its own way. Nuclear states have a negative view of the Supreme 
Council resolution. 
  [Horyn] The first reaction was voiced by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev. He argued that Ukraine had declared 
itself a nuclear state. I will try to explain his position. 
Russia, during the first stage of Ukraine's path to nonnuclear 
status, behaved like a state that has full control over foreign 
territory. Tactical nuclear weapons were stolen from Ukraine by 
strategic units, which at that time were under the control of 
the CIS Supreme Headquarters. Ukraine had no chance to 
counteract Russia's unceremonious behavior on Ukrainian 
territory. 
  Taking this into account, Ukraine put strategic nuclear 
weapons under administrative control. Russia has lost an 
opportunity to withdraw strategic nuclear weapons from Ukraine 
without Ukraine's consent. Moreover, despite the fact that the 
possessions of the former USSR on Ukrainian territory were 
declared to be Ukrainian property, Russia did not recognize that 
the tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn from Ukraine were 
Ukrainian property. It was done without regard to the fact that 
Russia has also adopted a zero option. Nonrecognition of 
property implies a denial of compensation for material goods, 
for enriched uranium and plutonium. 
  There is also a third reason for the harsh Russian reaction. 
Politicians in Moscow understand pretty well that strategic 
nuclear weapons are a stimulating factor. Even despite the fact 
that Ukraine does not exercise operational control over 
strategic nuclear weapons, their presence plays an important and 
stimulating role. Therefore, Ukraine cannot be approached 
unceremoniously, as was done with Moldova, Georgia, and 
Tajikistan. 
  [Levytskyy] How will the ratification of START I and, 
subsequently, the destruction of nuclear missiles affect the 
economic situation in Ukraine? 
  [Horyn] The reservations in the ratification document state 
that Ukraine will be able to implement the adopted obligations 
providing it receive appropriate financial and material 
assistance from Western countries, as well as security 
guarantees. I would like to stress that the international 
community should be interested in Ukraine's movement toward 
nonnuclear status. The reduction of nuclear weapons is a matter 
of great interest for Ukraine as well, which has suffered from 
Chernobyl. This is a matter of interest for the United States, 
at which those rockets are aimed. The United States should take 
the most active part in liquidating nuclear weapons, because 
this question directly affects U.S. national security. 
  [Levytskyy] Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Panchenko: "Chain Reaction of </F>
Disintegration. The Catastrophic State of Nuclear Power 
Engineering in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Energodar-Zaporozhye -- The Ukrainian Supreme 
Council has lifted the moratorium which it introduced in August 
1990 on the construction of new units at the republic's nuclear 
stations. The ban is lifted, but the chain reaction provoked by 
it continues. 
  The Chernobyl disaster hit Ukraine twice. The first time was 
in April 1986; the second in the summer of 1990. Behind the 
"concern for the people's welfare" which moved some people's 
deputies to conduct an unprecedented antinuclear campaign could 
be seen a desire to reap political capital quickly for 
themselves. 
  Hotheads, only superficially familiar with the problem, 
assured the people that Ukraine could get by without nuclear 
electric power stations [AES], and if they were all closed no 
one would notice. Things never got as far as closures, but a 
moratorium, the idea of which was supported by the Ukrainian 
Communist Party and Communist deputies in parliament, was 
adopted. 
  ...Ukraine's five AES's have fourteen power units with a 
total capacity of 12.8 million kw. In 1990 they provided a 
little less than one-third of all electricity generated in the 
republic. Today nuclear stations bear 40 percent of the load. 
  But at the same time the symptoms of the current power 
crisis 
were already more than obvious. Since 1988 the generation of 
electricity in the republic has constantly declined. There are 
two reasons for this: First, half of the equipment at thermal 
electric power stations [TES] is worn out and needs to be 
replaced. Second, the extraction of energy sources has declined 
in both Russia and Ukraine, and their price has risen. But 
whereas TES's have reduced production, AES's have increased 
theirs year after year. 
  ...Parliament's former decision halted the construction of 
three megawatt units in the Zaporozhye, Rovno, and Khmelnitskaya 
AES's. Economists have estimated that, given international 
electricity prices of 6-7 cents per kilowatt, a year's 
moratorium on one unit costs the country $500 million. However, 
this is not all: In shutting the door to nuclear power 
engineering, the Supreme Council automatically halted the 
development of high technologies in Ukraine. 
  The first to disperse were the builders. Then came the turn 
of personnel operating the AES's themselves. Clever people, the 
majority of them young, at once understood that the moratorium 
sounded the death knell to their careers in Ukraine. No new 
units -- no new positions. And pay? In Russia the controller 
of a unit [operator upravlenii blokom] earns $300 a month, 
whereas at the Zaporozhye AES it is 10 times less. Many, just 
to support their families, are forced to dash off to Moscow 
after their shift and sell goods... 
  When Russia began to launch its own nuclear power 
engineering 
program, recruiters went in droves to Energodar and other 
Ukrainian AES's. They offer the specialists they need not only 
a decent wage, but also apartments. Highly skilled workers, 
whose training takes from three to five years, began to pack 
their suitcases en masse. This year alone around 400 qualified 
nuclear engineers left for Russia. If things continue like 
this, Vladimir Bronnikov, director of the Zaporozhye AES stated, 
there will be simply no one to operate the sixth unit. 
  The moratorium forced plants producing equipment for AES's 
to seek orders more crudely. The quality control system became 
unnecessary and collapsed. As a result, many enterprises can no 
longer deliver equipment meeting the requirements of nuclear 
power engineering. The shortage of equipment and its low 
quality and high cost have slowed the rate of the refitting of 
operational units. It is clear that their safety has not 
increased as a result. 
  It is now clear that the aims declared by the moratorium's 
supporters were not achieved. The ecological situation in 
Ukraine has not improved; rather the reverse. The generation of 
electricity has fallen. 
  What should be done next? The moratorium has been lifted, 
but, alas, this will not affect the power crisis in the 
republic. The sixth unit at the Energodar AES will come on 
stream not earlier than next March-April. Zaporozhye AES 
workers, despite the ban, have nevertheless been able to 
assemble the equipment and keep it in pre-operational mode. At 
the Rovno and Khmelnitskaya stations construction of units is 
not complete, and the equipment is not yet all in place. Now it 
will have to be collected from all over the CIS or production 
will have to be set up in Ukraine. Specialists believe that, on 
condition that it is given strong state support, work could be 
completed there in 1995-1996. 
  But what question can there be of support, when the Ministry 
of Power and Electrification owes the Zaporozhye station alone 
more than 30 billion karbovantsy for energy already produced? 
Ukraine's debt to its neighbors is great. So that the future 
of these units is unclear, as is the future of power engineering 
in the republic as a whole.

  [Text] Simferopol, 5 Jan -- The press service of the 
Crimean Council of Ministers reports that Ukraine and the Crimea 
have signed an agreement on introducing a national taxation 
system into the tax relations between the Crimea and Ukraine. 
In accordance with this, taxes payable by the citizens of the 
Crimea will go to the budget of the Republic of the Crimea. A 
sum equal to one-twentieth of the state budget of Ukraine will 
in its turn be payable as contributions by the republic's 
centralized budget to Kiev. The relevant document was signed by 
Acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy and the 
chairman of the Crimean Council of Ministers, Borys Samsonov.

<F P=106> [Statements by Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch and </F>
New Ukraine leader Volodymyr Hrynyov; place and date not given: 
"Let Us Light New Year Candles for Fulfilling Our Wishes"] 
  [Text] [Plyushch] This past year has not been easy for our 
country and people. However, those who believe that the current 
hardships and economic crisis have been originated exclusively 
during the years of Ukraine's independence are wrong. I would 
like to recall that from 1985 [to 1990] the USSR foreign debt 
increased from $28 billion to $55 billion, and hard currency 
reserves decreased two-fold. This "spending" took place over 
some five years. In other words, we have come to the crisis not 
alone, but along with our brothers and sisters from the Union, 
during several years. By the way, they also, as well as an 
array of countries from the former socialist camp, are 
experiencing difficulties caused by the processes connected with 
economic reform. 
  However, we are not without sin. One could provide many 
examples of our own mistakes caused by the extreme complexity of 
the state-building process, our lack of experience, and our 
evident shortsightedness. 
  Nevertheless, we should not seek the guilty today, as we 
used 
to do, but we should jointly find a solution. One such 
solution, in my opinion, is to liberate producers of industrial 
and agricultural goods. In place of the Moscow government, 
today we have the one in Kiev. Certain voices can being heard 
saying that it is necessary to establish tough administrative 
structures in the oblasts, and that they should take everything 
in their hands and restore order. But a producer should only 
obey the law and by the law be connected with the state. 
  In politics, there is a priority task for us today -- 
elections for the new legislature formed along professional 
lines. 
  Certain people predict that the people will not participate 
in the elections, because they do not trust anybody. But, this 
is an incorrect opinion. They want to trust somebody, but they 
do not know whom. 
  I believe that it is impossible -- and sociological surveys 
confirm this -- for our people to elect a dictatorship, and this 
will lead the country away from the edge of the precipice. The 
people must elect legislators who will endorse centrist 
approaches to the most acute problems. Only such legislators 
will be able to form an efficient government. 
  I believe that not a single man, for sure not a dictator or 
yet another secretary general, but a centrist bloc that will 
develop a national platform, not a narrow party one, will become 
Ukraine's leader in 1994. 
  [Hrynyov] I believe that 1994 will see the introduction of 
intensive reforms in Ukraine. I do not expect any new political 
forces to appear and assume responsibility for carrying out such 
reforms. I think that the harsh reality will force Ukraine to 
reform its economy. 
  We have wasted the opportunity to do so over the last two 
years. We have not even tried to actually introduce reforms, but 
spent our time on uncomprehensible policy which follows the 
principle of "neither a plan nor a market." This has led to the 
sharp deterioration of basic preconditions that are necessary 
for the introduction of market reforms. 
  Two years ago, one could assess our situation as dramatic, 
today -- as tragic: We are beginning reform while in a state of 
complete economic destruction, a lack of control over economic 
processes, and the collapse of the financial system. Despite 
these facts, I repeat that 1994 will be the year of beginning 
economic reforms. 
  Guarantees for success do not exist. Failure to proceed on 
the path of transformations means losing Ukraine. 
  I am very aware of public opinion polls, and they indicate 
that the psychological atmosphere in Ukraine is that reforms are 
considered as not one of the variants, but as the only one 
possibility, and that there is no other path but the path of 
market reforms.

<F P=106> [Statements by People's Deputies Ihor Yukhnovskyy, Viktor </F>
Pynzenyk, and Mykhaylo Kosiv, cofounders of the Nonparty 
Professionals' Electoral Bloc "New Wave"] 
  [Excerpts] [Yukhnovskyy] [passage omitted] The Ukrainian 
nation is facing the most crucial task -- building the state and 
working for its benefit. It is easy to criticize government 
activities, but it is difficult to assume leadership, rule the 
state, make decisions, and foresee their consequences. This is 
why small and big political parties should come together to 
resolve these principal problems. 
  Take inflation, for example, the devaluation of the 
Ukrainian 
karbovanets, the unjustifiably high exchange rate of the U.S. 
dollar and the Russian ruble. One of the sources of inflation 
is the erroneous postulate that the former can be curbed by 
restraining wages. It is only true in some cases, when wages 
exceed a certain reasonable level. However, in Ukraine, the 
situation is quite different. People's wages are so low that 
their purchasing power in fact equals zero. People are losing 
interest in work and discipline. 
  Can anything be done to alleviate the situation? 
Undoubtedly, yes. This includes the functioning of customs 
offices on all the borders, an increase in wages on the basis of 
introducing a land tax, the introduction of a tax on the active 
part of enterprises' capital stock. These measures must be 
accompanied by the privatization of land and state property. Of 
course, monthly wages should be increased to a certain 
reasonable limit of say, $90. The next step toward curbing 
inflation is regulation of the nation's banking system. The ban 
on bank credits was a desperate measure and amounted to 
acknowledging complete disability to run the financial system. 
[passage omitted] 
  Overwhelmed by our domestic problems, we seldom speak of our 
foreign policy. Unfortunately, the latter is conducted so 
inadequately that Ukraine's rating in the world community is 
very low. We are irresolute in our relations with Russia and 
the newly independent states. This important aspect will also 
depend on those who assume power. 
  Political contests sometimes resemble military drills and 
children's games played by grown-ups. We should not look for 
harsh words leading to political divisions within society. We 
need an increase in mutual respect and trust on all levels. 
  We are standing on the threshold of elections. We should 
rally around a centrist electoral bloc. 
  [Pynzenyk] A lot of people are asking the same question: 
Can we overcome the crisis and halt the skyrocketing inflation? 
Do we have experts capable of leading our state to prosperity? 
  I can give positive answers to all those questions. We have 
every chance of exiting the current situation. Many people 
believe that the latter is a result of reform. However, it is 
the irresoluteness and inconsistency of reform, as well as 
attempts to revert its progress that have caused the dramatic 
deterioration of the situation, impoverishment, corruption, 
embezzlements, and the flourishing of the shadow economy. 
  Two major factors are determining the critical situation in 
Ukraine's economy: the leadership's lack of political will and 
professionalism. The problem of drafting a program for putting 
an end to the crisis does not exist. The problem lies in the 
high echelons' will to implement this program. [passage omitted] 
  Unfortunately, time and again, we witness the mass 
incompetence of officials entitled to make crucial decisions. 
These people often hide behind beautiful phrases while, in 
fact, only caring about their own personal well-being. 
  There are a lot of specialists in Ukraine ready to assume 
responsibility for changes in people's lives. However, no 
individual efforts can change the situation. There is the need 
for a team of professionals enjoying appropriate 
political support. 
  Only professional resolute measures can save the situation. 
The experience of Poland, the Czech Republic, Latvia, 
Lithuania, or Estonia proves that there is no option to such 
measures. 
  Today, our people have a unique chance to create political 
prerequisites for reform (through the legislative elections) and 
to form (by means of the legislature) a professional government. 
  We are the masters of our fate and we have no right to pass 
our hardships of today onto our children and grandchildren. 
  [Kosiv] [passage omitted] We are being ruled by Russified 
turncoats who do not want to and never will consolidate 
Ukrainian independence. They are doing everything to prevent 
stabilization in production and banking, as well as to halt 
reform. State functionaries, red managers' corps, and the 
leadership of the agroindustrial complex use all available 
mechanisms to prolong their control over national property, 
because this property is easy to steal. 
  We do not have to invent anything special. The Baltics, for 
example, were in a similar situation but they endured Russian 
pressure, launched market processes, and set out upon the path 
of civilized development. Will we be able to elect a Supreme 
Council able to form a government of the independent Ukrainian 
state?

  [Text] Kiev, 4 Jan -- The second working sitting has taken 
place of the the All-Ukrainian Electoral Committee of the 
Democratic Association bloc, which unites parties and 
organizations of national democratic orientation such as Rukh 
[People's Movement of Ukraine], URP [Ukrainian Republican 
Party], DemPU [Democratic Party of Ukraine], KUN [Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists], Prosvita [Enlightenment], SOU [Union of 
Officers of Ukraine], and others. Chaired by the URP honorary 
chairman, Levko Lukyanenko, the sitting considered and 
coordinated lists of the bloc's candidates in separate Ukrainian 
regions. Rukh was accused of destructive activity in that some 
local NRU organizations, in particular the one in Kharkov, in 
spite of prior arrangement had composed lists of candidates of 
their own. People's Council Chairman Ivan Zayets brushed aside 
these accusations saying that this situation was the result of 
the sluggishness of other organizations who had not made up 
their mind yet exactly in which districts to nominate their 
candidates. It was decided to organize regional tours by 
leaders of the bloc's parties to settle contentious issues 
locally. The second part of the sitting discussed the name of 
the bloc and its pre-election slogans.

  [Text] Simferopol, 5 Jan -- The Crimean-Tatar People's 
Majlis has called on its countrymen to boycott the Crimean 
Republic presidential elections since none of the candidates 
promises to meet the Crimean-Tatar people's demands. According 
to a recent statement by a majlis leader, the majlis has 
indisputable influence over an absolute majority of voters among 
the Crimean-Tatars. 
  On the other hand, Vashtiy Abdurayimov, the leader of the 
National Movement of Crimean Tatars, who became head of the 
organization after the death of its founder and leader Yuriy 
Osmanov, stressed that the majlis was in fact betraying the 
national interests of the Crimean Tatars. In Abdurayimov's 
opinion, the Crimean Tatars must by all means vote in the 
Crimean presidential elections in order to elect a president who 
would more or less suit the Crimean-Tatar people. According to 
some sources, Abdurayimov is inclined to support the candidacy 
of Ivan Yermakov, Ukraine's presidential representative in 
Sevastopol, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council [as 
received]. 
  Majlis leader Mustafa Dzhamilev is known to have recently 
met 
President Kravchuk. Although the results of the talks are not 
known, local observers believe they reached a certain, if not 
full understanding.

  [Text] "The Union in Support of Crimea's Republic" (USCR), 
one of Crimea's most popular parties, has urged setting up an 
anti-government opposition bloc. 
  As senior party member Vladimir Zubarev, chairman of the 
Crimean Bar of Lawyers, told INTERFAX, "because of the tragic 
death of the Union's chairman, Jacob Apter, a member of 
Ukraine's Parliament, the party has been unable to nominate its 
candidate to the Crimean presidency and, for this reason, will 
support the nomination of Ivan Ermakov, the Ukrainian 
president's envoy to Sevastopol, advocating the integration of 
Sevastopol and Crimea in a single state structure. 
  Zubarev made it clear that "the USCR is ready to take part 
in 
forming a popular coalition government." In his words, "an 
economic council with Russian economists taking part in it has 
been set up for that." 
  He reported that the political council had decided to 
"constructively oppose the current Crimean Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Nikolay Batrov, nominated to the presidency despite his 
personal responsibility for the plight in the republic."

the oblast state administration, asserted this to be the case at 
a 3 January meeting of the workers of Lvivprylad production 
association that nominated him as a candidate for election to 
the Ukrainian Supreme Council. 
  Zenon Kotyk officially told a UNIAN correspondent that the 
base remains in the regional communal property fund's ownership.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, January 5 (TASS) -- The latest prices hike 
has compelled many Ukrainian families to reduce their spendings 
substantially, BUSINESS-TASS has learned today from the 
Ukrainian NORMA-PRESS NEWS SERVICE. Today, according to expert 
estimates, the physiologial survival basket costs 383,996 
karbovanets, which is double the november figure. 
  A more or less normal minimum consumer basket, comprising 
twenty products, now costs 900,738 karbovanets, while the 
average wages are much lower than that. NORMA-PRESS economists 
stress that all the measures taken by the government to raise 
minimal wages, pensions, scholarships, and allowances to poor 
families leave these sections of the population without any hope 
for even purely physiological survival.

Kuldiga battalion of the Latvian Home Guard. Haekkerup stressed 
that the radar station should not be left in Latvia and that the 
dismantling of the radar should be agreed on at Latvian-Russian 
talks. Haekkerup also positively assessed the Latvian Home Guard.

  [Text] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup, who is 
visiting Latvia, said at a meeting with reporters today that 
NATO would most probably turn down Lithuania's request for 
admittnce to that organization. Haekkerup explained that he has 
that impression knowing the attitude of NATO member states 
towards the involvement of new states in the organization. 
  A special program proposed by the United States for states 
which wish to cooperate with NATO will be discussed at a 
conference of the heads of NATO member states scheduled to take 
place in Brussels on 10 January. Participation in this program 
would be a mandatory condition to become a NATO member state. 
  The program provides that countries will be able to conclude 
bilateral cooperation agreements with NATO. NATO will provide 
necessary consultations for such countries in cases when their 
territorial integrity, security or political sovereignty might 
be threatened. 
  NATO is also ready to cooperate with the Baltic states and 
Russia within the framework of such a program. Haekkerup drew 
journalists' attention to the fact that the conclusion of 
bilateral agreements would allow NATO to cooperate individually 
with each state taking into account its peculiarities and wishes.

  [Text] Latvia has expressed positive support for 
Lithuania's intention to join NATO; at the same time making it 
known that it will not hurry to follow Lithuania's example. We 
are satisfied that Lithuania has done this; if the right moment 
comes, we will do the same, Gunars Meierovics, Latvian minister 
of state for relations with the Baltic and Nordic countries, has 
said. In his view, at the moment there is no sense in Latvia 
turning to NATO with a request to join, because, in contrast to 
Lithuania, Latvia still has about 20,000 Russian soldiers on its 
territory. 
  Meeting in Stockholm today with Swedish Prime Ministert Carl 
Bildt were Martins Virsis, parliamentary secretary at the 
Latvian Foreign Ministry; Aleksandrs Kirsteins, chairman of the 
Saeima Foreign Affairs Commission, and Juris Sinka, a member of 
the Saeima Foreign Affairs Commission. They discussed 
Latvian-Russian relations, devoting most attention to the issue 
of the withdrawal of the Russian Army and the problem of the 
Skrunda radar station. The Swedish prime minister stressed the 
need for our country to agree with Russia on the withdrawal of 
the army by concluding an agreement in the nearest future. To 
quote Bildt, that would an important investment in promoting 
stability in the Baltic region.

  [Text] Riga, January 5 (LETA) -- The press service of the 
Foreign Ministry here has received a statement released to the 
press by professor Wolfgang Von Stetten, chairman of the Baltic 
parliamentary group within the German Bundestag. The German 
parliamentarian calls on the German Bundestag and Western 
countries to throw their weight in support of the Baltic states, 
amid the threats voiced by the Russian ultra-nationalist 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and worries sparked in the Baltic states 
by the hints which have cropped up in the New Year's address of 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to his fellow citizens. "It has 
to be made clear to the Kremlin leadership that, whatever the 
government of the Russian Federation is, independence of the 
three Baltic states has to be inviolable," says the statement. 
"Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia should not be betrayed and sold 
out once again, as it has already happened in 1940, 1941 and 
1945. Russia ought to be told that the remaining troops be 
withdrawn from Latvia and Estonia in 1994." 
  Dr. Von Stetten maintained that he had not witnessed any 
evidence of Russians being discriminated repressed in any of the 
three Baltic countries, they had been only deprived of their 
self-assumed rights to act as occupants and masters of the three 
people, which they had enjoyed until recently. He pointed out 
that legislation on minorities rights in Estonia and Lithuania 
met the most strict European standards, the only controversy 
being the laws on citizenship. Von Stetten said, however, that 
the citizenship laws in Lithuania and Latvia are much more 
liberal than respective legislations in the countries of Western 
Europe, including Germany. The German parliamentarian underlined 
that both the allegations by Zhirinovskiy and implications by 
President Yeltsin were groundless. 
  Von Stetten also stated that the former occupants could not 
be granted any privileges they are claiming so vehemently. The 
chairman of the German parliamentary group suggested it was 
necessary to consider seriously and to discuss an option to 
grant the Baltic states the NATO membership, or to offer Latvia, 
Lithuania and Estonia guarantees of their security, in order to 
ease their worries of a new eventual annexation on the part of 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Viktor Belikov report: "Moscow Government Restricts Scale </F>
of `Protest Actions'"] 
  [Text] Having examined notifications from opposition 
organizations concerning mass measures to be held 9, 11, and 12 
January, the Moscow government has adopted decisions sharply 
reducing the number of people permitted to participate in them 
and changing the places where the demonstrations will be held. 
  The leaders of the "Russian All-National Union," the 
National 
Salvation Front, the Russian Communist Workers Party, and 
"Working Moscow," had coordinated their plans in terms of the 
time and place of mass actions of "protest against the 21 
September-4 October 1993 coup d'etat." The demonstrations were 
meant to be timed to coincide with the opening of the State 
Duma, starting Sunday with a rally on Free Russia Square outside 
the White House. Then on Tuesday and Wednesday the plan was to 
picket the approaches to the Kremlin, conduct a mass rally on 
Lubyanka Square in the evening, and organize a procession of 
thousands through the city's main streets. 
  As was announced 5 January at a City Hall meeting with 
representatives of the action's organizers, the Moscow 
government has made an area near the Russian White House 
available for a rally of up to 1,000 participants on 9 January. 
A mass rally cannot possibly be held 11 January on Lubyanka 
Square because of the inevitable disruptions and interruptions 
in the work of city transportation during the rush hour. 
"Sakharovskaya Ploshchadka" (No. 1) at Luzhniki is being made 
available instead. 
  There will be no pickets outside the Kremlin or large 
processions along streets in downtown Moscow. Instead, 100 
pickets may appear at the high-rise State Duma building on Novyy 
Arbat between 0900 and 1900 on 12 January.

  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The Russian Central 
Electoral Commission has announced on Thursday that elections to 
the new Russian parliament will be held in the self-styled 
Caucasian republic of Chechnya on March 13, 1994. 
  Chechnya, which proclaimed sovereignty, refused to hold 
elections to the new Russian legislature on December 12. 
  The Central Electoral Commission proposed to the people and 
the leadership of Chechnya to "consider and positively solve the 
issue of the republican participation in elections to the 
Federal Assembly of Russia in March 1994". 
  "The Chechen republic, according to the Russian 
Constitution, 
was and remains a fully-fledged subject of Russia and should be 
worthily represented in the Federal Assembly", the commission 
said.

  [Text] Head of the North Ossetian Government Sergey 
Khetagurov described the presidential elections scheduled for 
January 16 as "extremely untimely." According to INTERFAX 
sources, Khetagurov told North Ossetian intellectuals that the 
first round of elections would be unlikely to bring about 
definite results. 
  He urged the voters to rally around the future president and 
prevent a social split irrespective of the election results. 
  The Central Electoral Commission informed INTERFAX, 
meanwhile, that 6 out of the 8 candidates would continue the 
presidential race. Two candidates, among them former first 
secretary of the North Ossetian Communist Party Committee 
Aleksandr Dzasokhov, have withdrawn their candidacies. 
  Dzasokhov stated that he had removed his candidacy "in the 
interests of social consolidation and victory of the sound 
forces".

<F P=106> [Nikolay Gritchin report: "No National Radicals in </F>
Kabardino-Balkar Parliament"] 
  [Text] Nalchik -- The Kabardino-Balkar Republic parliament 
will start work following the Christmas vacation. Not a single 
national radical has made it into the supreme legislative organ 
this time. In electing 72 deputies for the next four years from 
224 candidates, the republic's population definitely showed its 
preference for centrists. 
  Between 18 months and two years ago the republic experienced 
an upsurge of national extremism -- there were open-ended 
rallies in Nalchik's main square attended by thousands of people 
calling on the authorities to resign, protest hunger strikes, 
and even an attempt to storm Government House. In order to 
defuse the situation, V. Kokov then relinquished his powers as 
chairman of the republic's Supreme Council. Tired of living 
under the threat of violence, the people rejected the 
extremists' calls and in the first presidential elections 
plumped for V. Kokov from among the many candidates. His policy 
of stabilization, consensus, and unity with Russia is supported 
today too. Confirmation of that was the first joint session of 
the chambers held just before the New Year. It elected the 
chamber chairmen and deputy chairmen backed by President V. 
Kokov. The Council of the Republic is headed by Vice Premier Z. 
Nakhushev, who is a Kabardin. The Council of Representatives is 
headed by M. Zhaboyev, technical director of the Tyrnyauz 
Tungsten and Molybdenum Combine (Europe's largest), who is a 
Balkar. The deputy chairmen are Russians -- L. Fedochenko, 
deputy director of the Uplands Geophysical Institute, and Ye. 
Golovko, director of a sewn goods enterprise. 
  A note of consensus was struck by the voters themselves. 
Contrary to the fears that people would vote only for 
representatives of their own ethnic group, the Russian Mayskiy 
Rayon elected as parliamentary deputy the Kabardin Yu. 
Shomakhov, while Nalchik plumped for a Kabardin, a Balkar, and a 
Russian. But the republic is most proud of the fact that a 
confident victory in the elections to the Council of 
Representatives was won by A. Shkhagoshev, a senior official at 
the Kabardino-Balkar MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] 
Administration for Combating Organized Crime, who lost his hands 
when confiscating a grenade from a participant in the open-ended 
rally outside Government House 18 months ago. People from 
different ethnic groups collected money to pay for him to be 
treated in Germany. The German doctors managed to achieve the 
inconceivable -- they sewed his hands back on. Adalbi Lyulevich 
can now do a great deal with these hands -- he even drives.

<F P=106> [Viktor Filippov report: "Vologda Governor Forms Docile </F>
Duma"] 
  [Text] Vologda -- Top state officials have again fallen 
out in Vologda. Governor Nikolay Podgornov has set the local 
duma elections for 20 March. But president's representative 
Guriy Sudakov has publicly described the future duma at a press 
conference as a "device for voting through projects prepared by 
the administration." 
  Professor Guriy Sudakov delivered this sharply worded 
statement after analyzing how many documents on the local duma 
elections and local self-government organs signed by Nikolay 
Podgornov are in line with the Constitution and the president's 
Edict "On the Basic Principles of the Organization of State 
Power in the Components of the Russian Federation." 
  "The system of powers in the region should be balanced," 
according to president's representative Sudakov. "But since 
October we have only had executive-administrative power 
operating here. In addition, the temptation has arisen to 
exploit the upcoming elections to consolidate that priority 
forever. Under the president's edict, the rayon self-government 
organ is to be formed from representatives of the 
self-government organs of villages, settlements, and so forth. 
But according to the statute signed by the Vologda Oblast head 
of administration, the rayon assemblies will be formed solely 
from the heads of local administrations." 
  In his opinion, representative power in Vologda Oblast will, 
if formed according to Governor Podgornov's conception, be 
subordinate to executive power. Among other things, the 
governor has set tough deadlines within which the future oblast 
duma must submit legal acts to him for signature. 
  The membership of the Vologda Oblast Duma has been 
determined 
by the governor at 15 deputies, only six of whom will work on a 
permanent basis. The governor has allowed workers in organs of 
executive power to combine their duties with deputy status. 
President's representative Sudakov fears that on 20 March the 
people of Vologda will get an administrative-industrial lobby 
obedient to the governor instead of a proper legislative organ.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Shchelkovo (Moscow Oblast, central Russia), 6 Oct 
[date as received] (ITAR-TASS) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader 
of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), who received 
the card of a State Duma deputy in this city near Moscow today, 
assured those present that "the election campaign was honest" 
and that his party did not receive financial aid from any 
companies. 
  Elected to the parliament in the 114th single-seat 
constituency in Shchelkovo, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was today 
approved by members of the district election commission as 
deputy, and the local adminstration congratulated him. The 
commission's chairman assured those assembled that although some 
people questioned the results of the elections, there are no 
grounds to speak about abuse during the elections. According to 
him, for instance, a suit had been filed with judicial bodies to 
declare the results of the elections in the 114th district 
invalid. 
  As usual, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy vigorously "beat off" 
Russian 
and foreign journalists who were still interested in the problem 
of financing the LDPR's election campaign and the results of his 
foreign tour. "Nobody gave us anything, it is all lies," he 
said and added that the campaign was conducted at the expense of 
"money orders from Russian citizens." "Not a single mafia 
grouping, economic structure, bank, or political organization 
gave us a kopeck," the LDPR leader claimed. 
  At the same time, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy did not deny that he 
accepts foreign currency from foreign journalists for his 
interviews. "There is a long line and those who want to jump it 
have to pay," he said. 
  He tried to play down the consequences of the scandal caused 
by his pronouncements in Bulgaria and Germany's refusal to grant 
him an entry visa. "[Bulgarian President] Zhelyu Zhelev was 
frightened by something, but all is now sorted out." According 
to him there was "an outburst of conflicting opinions in 
Germany," but now "everything has calmed down too, and the 
minister of foreign affairs is prepared to receive me." 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, he is being invited "to Austria, 
Spain, France, and Norway." 
  Questions regarding U.S. President Bill Clinton's refusal to 
meet the leader of the victorious party during his forthcoming 
visit to Moscow brought an especially emotional response. "I am 
ready, but he is scared -- and so much the worse for him," 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stated. "Shame on such a president, let 
him go on playing his saxophone at home and not come here at 
all." "You in the west are all scared of the new, honest, and 
brave politician emerging in Russia," the LDPR leader added. 
  Answering the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, 
Zhirinovskiy reported that leaders of the four largest factions 
in parliament have reached an agreement in principle on the 
candidature of the future speaker . "He will be a representative 
of a small neutral faction and his four deputies will be 
representatives of the four largest factions," Zhirinovskiy 
specified.

  Democratic Senator Sam Nunn and republican Senator Richard 
Lugar represent those of America's political forces that support 
President Clinton's course toward large-scale economic 
cooperation with Russia. It is they who drew up the law on 
financial and technical assistance to Russia and the CIS 
countries in carrying through conversion and elimination of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Today the conversation was about the new Russian Parliament 
and how its work and interaction with the president will be 
organized. 
  Filatov said that the line-up of forces has already been 
determined. Now work with the factions is underway and 
questions of personnel and the agenda are being determined. The 
election results and the progress of reforms in Russia, plus 
questions of security, disarmament, and development of 
cooperation, will also be at the center of attention at the 
forthcoming meeting of the presidents of the two countries in 
Moscow next week.

and Richard Lugar Wednesday [5 January], he said that the step 
by the North Korean leadership could deteriorate the situation 
not only on the Korean Peninsula, but the world over. 
  Pyongyang declared its intention to withdraw from the 
nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty in March 1993. Grachev said Russia 
favors further inter-Korean dialogue. The minister described as 
counterproductive the possibility to impose international 
sanctions against North Korea. The problem should not be 
tackled with hastiness. He believes it is necessary to consider 
the possible political and military implications that could 
follow the sanctions, as well as to ask for China's opinion on 
the issue, since the country has very close contacts with North 
Korea. 
  The minister has said that Russia stands for a balanced 
approach to the issue. He also believes that the international 
impact on Pyongyang should be aimed at drawing North Korea to 
rejoin the treaty, not at expanding its isolation. The 
development of the North Korean-U.S. talks, he believes, could 
be an effective means of influence. Russia and China could also 
influence Pyongyang.

  [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told 
American senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar on Wednesday [5 
January] that he favored broader cooperation with NATO. He 
noted, however, that NATO's concept - partnership for peace - 
should take into account the interests of all states, not only 
the NATO members. 
  Grachev believes that this concept should apply not only to 
NATO, but also to the all-European security system and said that 
Russia was ready to develop cooperation with NATO on the basis 
of the following principles: the development of general 
political contacts, coordination of positions, and practical and 
coordinated actions. 
  Commenting on the basic principles of Russia's military 
doctrine at the senators' request, Grachev stated that this 
document was political rather than military, and that the 
renunciation of the principle not to use nuclear weapons first 
puts it on a par with similar documents on other nuclear powers. 
  Russia views nuclear weapons as a deterrent, not as a means 
of warfare, he said. He noted in this connection that the 
commitment not to use nuclear weapons first was at variance with 
this assumption. 
  He expressed the opinion that this commitment had not been 
taken seriously by the west. It was viewed simply as a 
propaganda statement undermining the former Soviet Union's 
military policy, said Grachev. He remarked, however, that the 
former Soviet Union had no plans to deal preemptive nuclear 
blows on any country.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has said that 
Ukraine was, to all intents and purposes, a nuclear state since 
its parliament had virtually not ratified the strategic arms 
reduction treaty (START-1). 
  In late 1993 the Ukrainian parliament ratified the Start-1 
treaty, but with reservations which changed its essence. 
  Meeting in Moscow Wednesday well-known political leaders, 
U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, the Russian Minister 
said that presence of nuclear arms on the territory of Ukraine 
would be discussed at the Moscow summit January 12 between 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his U.S. counterpart Bill 
Clinton. 
  Grachev believes taking part in the summit will be Ukrainian 
leader Leonid Kravchuk who will give a certain impetus to the 
possible solution. 
  Nuclear weapons, believes the Minister, cannot be a subject 
of bargaining. This is dangerous, said Grachev. 
  He said he has a hot line with U.S. Defense Secretary Les 
Aspin. 
  Grachev has said on Wednesday, at 16:00 he intends to 
discuss 
with his U.S. counterpart acute security problems.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "Russia Ready for Cooperation"] </F>
  [Text] Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense 
minister, received U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, who 
are visiting Russia, 5 January. During the conversation they 
touched on the state of and prospects for Russian-U.S. military 
cooperation. The increase in the intensity of ties in this 
sphere is indicated by the fact that last year there were 17 
major events related to establishing cooperation between the two 
states' armed forces and another 26 are scheduled for the coming 
year. 
  At the U.S. senators' request Army Gen. Pavel Grachev told 
them about the features of Russia's new military doctrine. In 
particular he stressed that it is no coincidence that there is 
no reference in the "Basic Provisions of Russian Federation 
Military Doctrine" to Russia not being the first to use nuclear 
weapons. First, the corresponding U.S., British, and French 
documents contain no such provision. Second, such a pledge on 
our part did not enable nuclear weapons to be regarded as a 
means of averting war and a factor for deterring a potential 
aggressor. 
  The Russian defense minister described Russia's attitude to 
the "Partnership for Peace" idea mooted by the United States by 
saying the following: "We are ready to support the idea insofar 
as it considers the security interests of all states without 
exception" and if it is based on an all-Europe rather than a 
bloc system of security. As we see it, Pavel Grachev pointed 
out, true partnership means developing political dialogue, 
regular consultations, and reaching agreed positions, and this 
activity may culminate in coordinated practical actions. Russia 
is ready for that kind of cooperation. 
  During the meeting they also discussed questions of 
cooperation in nuclear disarmament and housing construction for 
servicemen, in particular servicemen from the troops being 
withdrawn from Germany and the Baltic states. There was also a 
detailed discussion of Ukrainian and North Korean nuclear policy 
and Russia's view of these problems. 
  Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General 
Staff of the Russian Federation Armed Forces; Andrey Kokoshin, 
Russian first deputy defense minister; and, on the U.S. side, 
Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to Russia, took part in the 
conversation. 
  It is somewhat symbolic that on the same day the Russian and 
U.S. defense ministers had their first conversation over the 
direct telephone line connecting the offices of the heads of the 
two countries' military departments. Henceforth it will be 
easier and quicker to resolve urgent "burning" problems. 
Another step has been taken toward developing military 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 5 Jan -- A telephone conversation took place 
this evening between Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel 
Grachev and U.S. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin. An agreement 
on setting up a telephone hotline between the two countries' 
defense ministers in order to hold consultations and exchange 
opinions on defense and security issues was reached last 
September during the official visit of the Russian minister to 
the United States. 
  Yelena Agapova, the Russian defense minister's aide 
responsible for public and press relations, told the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that in their telephone conversation the defense 
ministers discussed a number of military-political issues of 
mutual interest. More specifically, they exchanged views on the 
prospects of bilateral cooperation in the military-political 
sphere and agreed on a number of issues concerning the 
preparations for the Russian-American command and staff exercise 
of peacemaking troops, scheduled to be held in the summer of 
1994 in the Privolzhskiy Military District. 
  At Les Aspin's request, Pavel Grachev set out his point of 
view on questions of the possible expansion of NATO. "We support 
a path which would lead to a truly all-European security 
system," the Russian minister said. "We believe that security 
and international stability should be inseparable and be backed 
up by all-European structures." Regarding the question of 
military cooperation between Russia and NATO, Pavel Grachev 
noted that today it is being implemented on a bilateral basis 
and within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council. This includes questions of peacekeeping activity, 
within the framework of which the possibility is being discussed 
of preparing for and carrying out joint peacekeeping operations 
under the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE and training 
military cadres to take part in peacekeeping operations. 
  "It is our hope that the `partnership for peace' concept, 
proposed by the United States, will not lead to a broadening of 
NATO detrimental to Russia's interests, but will help to 
strengthen stability in Europe," Pavel Grachev stressed.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Smirnov, deputy chief of the Central </F>
Bank of Russia Main Administration for Currency Regulation and 
Currency Control, followed by editorial comment: "Bank of 
Russia Agrees With Charges against GMM But Does Not Agree It Is 
Not Taking Steps"] 
  [Text] IZVESTIYA 24 December published items by two of its 
correspondents, Yu. Kovalenko and M. Berger, devoted to the 
Dutch company GMM [Global Money Management Trust]. Since 
Mikhail Berger focused his attention on the activity of this 
company, or to be more precise its office in Moscow, and also 
voiced a negative opinion of the Central Bank on this issue, I 
should like to answer this correspondent. 
  The office of the Dutch trust company "Trust Financial 
Services BV" is registered in Moscow. Under Russian legislation 
the offices of foreign firms are not corporate bodies and do not 
have the right to engage in commercial (economic) activity. 
  Thus, by taking money from citizens and corporate bodies, 
whether it was in rubles or hard currency, GMM twice violated 
Russian legislation. The first time when it embarked on 
commercial activity while it only had the status of an office. 
And the second time when it began operations involving money, 
which is only permitted to banks, while GMM is not a bank. 
  By calling its operations trust operations GMM is operating 
in a legislative vacuum since there is no law on trust in Russia 
and the company is very well aware of the fact. Trust 
operations presuppose that the owners of temporarily free money 
and securities entrust their management to trust companies with 
a view to deriving a profit. At the same time in the absence of 
a law on trust in Russia we have an adequate institutional basis 
for conducting operations involving the financial resources of 
corporate bodies and the population. That includes primarily 
banks and investment funds and in this connection GMM's maxim to 
the effect that it is introducing a new type of service onto the 
money market and we are not accepting it is unfounded. 
  And it is a very great pity that M. Berger, who has quite a 
good understanding of economics, should seem to be vindicating 
GMM's piratical actions when he speaks of "the 
incomprehensibility of Russian legislation, which allows an 
ambiguous interpretation of obvious things." It is true that he 
does not explain what obvious things and ambiguous 
interpretation he means. 
  Now about the fact that in M. Berger's opinion GMM is deeply 
"obligated to the Central Bank, which is not reacting in any way 
to the invasion of a foreign company onto the Russian financial 
market." 
  I ask to be forgiven for being obliged to say banal things 
but every public statement, particularly in the press, should be 
based on a knowledge of the facts. And the facts are that in 
late November I and administration chief Ye. Ivanov had a 
conversation with A. Liozner [name as transliterated], GMM's 
Moscow representative. He was informed of the illegal nature of 
the office's activity in attracting money in connection with the 
fact that it has no banking license and he was asked to halt 
this activity immediately or, if the office wanted to continue 
it, to start work on the creation of a bank. 
  On 23 December GMM was sent a letter from our main 
administration in which the company was once more asked to 
dissolve the contracts concluded with Russian Federation 
residents and stop advertizing for funds from Russian residents. 
  And another thing -- about advertizing. In IZVESTIYA 12 
November this year [as published] in an article entitled 
"Panama-3" M. Berger together with V. Kornev wrote in particular 
of their colleagues who are advertizing illegal activity: 
"...we are deeply convinced that newspapers and television 
companies which advertize the activity of firms with no legal 
right to undertake this activity should share the responsibility 
toward people who may be misled with their aid. Our esteemed 
colleagues, ask for your advertizers' licenses if they want, for 
instance, to take citizens' investments or vouchers. If they do 
not have the necessary documents, refuse this source of 
revenue." And they also wrote: "Esteemed colleagues, 
advertising is something more specific than bank notes. For 
this reason it can smell, sometimes very badly." 
  I absolutely agree but what about similar advertizing in 
IZVESTIYA? I should like to draw Mikhail Lvovich's attention to 
the advertisement of the "LEND" joint-stock company, slightly 
below and to the left of his article on GMM in the 24 December 
issue, in which the company promises first to take rubles from 
its client, then to convert them into currency, and to transfer 
the currency from a Swiss bank to anywhere in the world. 
Usually "LEND" offers an interest rate of 36 percent per annum 
(see IZVESTIYA 25 December, for instance) without the right to 
work with money. Examples of similar advertizing in IZVESTIYA 
could be continued but I hope the editorial office itself will 
discover the "harmful" advertizing and draw the necessary 
conclusions. 
  And for the future we are prepared for constructive 
cooperation with the newspaper since we can see mutual interest 
in it. [Smirnov ends] 
  From the editorial office: We are pleased that our 
assessments of GMM's activity in RUssia coincides with what the 
Central Bank of Russia thinks of it. But we want to draw 
attention to the fact that the outcome of similar thinking in 
the editorial office and the state institution can be 
fundamentally different. In the newspaper that outcome is a 
newspaper article, at the Central Bank it involves actions which 
accord with the situation. 
  Obviously it is important to explain to the lawbreakers that 
they are breaking the law. It is good that the currency 
regulation administration has done this twice: first verbally 
and then in writing. But what next? Even before the Russian 
Ministry of Finances had tried to explain to GMM that the 
company was operating illegally. But if the lawbreaker, despite 
a large amount of explanatory work, continues his fruitful 
illegal activity, collecting money from credulous or reckless 
citizens, then who should take steps? Should it not be the 
Central Bank? 
  Yes, we accept the rebukes over the publication of 
advertizing by dubious financial organizations, including LEND, 
of the illegality of whose actions Vladimir Smirnov kindly 
informs us. But under the law we are not obliged to check the 
authenticity of information supplied by the advertizer. To 
refuse such advertizing is a matter for our good will. While 
the Central Bank simply has to react immediately and effectively 
to the emergence of illegal banks and other gathers of money. 
But unfortunately practice shows that the Central Bank is 
either reluctant or unable to protect Russians from illegal 
"plowmen" in the russian money field. That is borne out by the 
experience of the successful illegal banking activity of the 
"Russkiy Dom Seleng," GMM, and others. 
  Proceeding from this premise we insist that GMM and other 
similar companies which have already appeared and perhaps intend 
to develop their activity should be eternally thankful to the 
Central Bank for its total inability to offer any resistance to 
the illegal financiers.

<F P=106> [Reports by Yuriy Kovalenko in Paris and Yevgeniy Bovkun in </F>
Bonn under general heading: "Neither France Nor Germany Wants 
To Let Zhirinovskiy In"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's intention to visit 
France in February and to meet with its state and party leaders 
has thrown the latter into some confusion. 
  Some time ago Vladimir Volfovich came to Paris, where Eduard 
Limonov, who was great friends with him at the time, organized 
for Zhirinovskiy a warm meeting with Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of 
the extreme right-wing National Front, and also a news 
conference attended by two French journalists and four Russian 
ones. 
  In the opinion of certain commentators, the French have no 
formal grounds for refusing the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] 
chairman a visa. 
  Zhirinovskiy, who claims that the LDP is closer in its views 
to the ruling Rally for the Republic party than to the National 
Front, would like to meet with Jacques Chirac, chairman of the 
Rally for the Republic and mayor of Paris. "I am against such a 
meeting, which will lend legality to someone who openly espouses 
fascist views," Pierre Lelouch, National Assembly deputy and 
Chirac's foreign policy adviser, declared in this regard. 
  A number of French public organizations have already come 
out 
against Zhirinovskiy's visit. The official position was 
expounded most clearly by Alain Lamassoure, minister for 
European affairs. France, he said, cannot tolerate the 
statements which the LDP chairman has made concerning Bulgaria, 
the Romanian people, Finland, Turkey, and other countries. It 
is perfectly clear, the minister emphasized, that unless he 
changes his position, we will hardly be able to receive him in 
France. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is of the same opinion. 
  This warning from Paris, however, does not seem to have had 
any effect. To all appearances, Vladimir Volfovich has 
energetically begun making travel arrangements. One of the 
stages in his preparations was an interview with a woman 
presenter for France's TF-1 television station against a 
backdrop of the Kremlin. (Incidentally, the Western press writes 
that Zhirinovskiy is now demanding $300 for a five-minute 
newspaper interview and many times more for a television one. 
At least, he asked one U.S. station for 60,000 "greenbacks"). 
  The LDP chairman intimidated people with the war which will 
break out in Russia if events develop as before, and with wars 
in general -- from India to Serbia. He announced that 
Chernomyrdin will be replaced as premier in March -- no, not by 
Zhirinovskiy but by a more neutral figure. He behaved 
aggressively -- which can hardly have pleased the French. 
  Bonn -- After Zhirinovskiy promised to "remove" an official 
of the FRG Consular Service in Sofia, declaring that he is still 
backed by the KGB and its best secret agents in Bulgaria, even 
those German mass media which reacted comparatively restrainedly 
to the previous threats against Germany by the "lawyer's son" 
(to arrange a second Chernobyl or send back the Russian troops 
being withdrawn from Germany) took an interest in him. 
  Even if Zhirinovskiy receives a diplomatic passport as a 
parliamentarian, a government spokesman emphasized, this will 
not mean he has the right of free entry to Germany, and he will 
in any case have to apply for a visa. 
  Along with seven people accompanying him, Zhirinovskiy was 
intending to spend 18 days in Germany and indicated as the 
purpose of the visit participation in a "European conference" 
supposedly to be held in Berlin. But all attempts by official 
establishments and journalists to find the organizers of this 
conference were in vain. 
  Nor was it possible to establish which firm had invited him 
to Berlin. The name which Zhirinovskiy himself indicated in the 
appropriate column of the form could equally well have applied 
to at least 20 very diverse enterprises.

Moscow; date not given: "The Two-Headed Russian Eagle Will Soon 
Spread Its Wings Over the Balkans!"] 
  [Text] Not far from the center of Moscow, at No. 1 
Ribnjikova Lane, amid digging and mud, in the attic above the 
hard-rock shop where, behind its protective iron bars, you can 
buy black leather jackets, black T-shirts, and all the things 
the hard rock and heavy metal fans desire, there are the offices 
of the winners of the recent elections in Russia, that is, the 
representatives of the LPDR, led by the controversial and 
politically unpredictable Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy. 
  A man sits among sheets of paper scattered all around the 
table and shabby couch in a narrow room with a view of a 
fire-devastated building. He is a close confidant and personal 
friend of Zhirinovskiy's, one of the founders of the party, the 
editor of the party bulletin, which has a bizarre name: 
"Zhirinovskiy's Justice" (and the minister of finances of the 
party's shadow cabinet. Zhirinovskiy has already proposed to 
Chernomyrdin, current Russian prime minister, that he take this 
man into his cabinet and give him the same portfolio.) The man 
we are talking about is Stanislav Mikhaylovich Zhebrovskiy! 
  A large map of the former Soviet Union hangs on the wall, 
with white-blue party flags designating the places where 
Zhirinovskiy won. 
  It is conspicuous that the most convincing victories were 
deep in the Russian provinces, in smaller industrial townships, 
in which the political economic giants used to prosper in the 
communist era, while now most of them are going to rack and ruin 
or are overwhelmed by losses. 
  The newspapers that support the democratic parties in Russia 
claim that, like Zhirinovskiy, Zhebrovskiy is of Jewish origin, 
although he is a greater Russian nationalist. 
  [Vurusic] Mr. Zhebrovskiy, although it seemed that you were 
the one who won the elections, some papers have reported that in 
the new parliament, that is in the Federation Council and Duma, 
the greatest number of seats will be occupied by the pro-Yeltsin 
Russia's Choice. 
  [Zhebrovsky] It is all nonsense, and the futile expectations 
of our so-called democrats. These elections were for party 
lists and individuals. Our party list won the greatest number 
of votes. And it did so quite convincingly, indeed! The Russian 
people did not want to vote for the repulsive and detestable 
Russia's Choice. As far as I know, only 8 percent of the 
electorate voted for that party list. However, Russia's Choice 
played a trick on the voters in the case of some lists, 
representing its candidates as independents. If it had been 
known that they were the candidates of Russia's Choice, the 
Russian people would have rejected them with loathing. For our 
people, it is like waving a red rag in front of a bull when you 
mention Russia's Choice. I witnessed an incident in Podolsk, 
when the people almost beat up the Russia's Choice candidate at 
its campaign rally. That is the real state of affairs. 
  [Vurusic] Foreign policy issues are an important part of 
your platform. You have put forward some new proposals for 
settling the crisis in former Yugoslavia, but it seems you 
support the Serbian side, in fact. 
  [Zhebrovsky] We support the Slav side! 
  [Vurusic] Croats are Slavs, too. 
  [Zhebrovskiy] All right, but you have Muslims there as well. 
In the region of former Yugoslavia we support the Slav, 
Christian-Orthodox side in the war, that is the Serbs. We are 
paying great attention, with a great deal of concern and anxiety 
indeed, to the way the Muslim ideology is breaking into Europe. 
They have been trying to conquer Europe for a long time and in 
various ways. For that reason one has to be extremely cautious. 
In our opinion, religion plays the most important role in that 
war. Muslims are the greatest danger to Europe. They are using 
you to establish their domination. Christianity must not allow 
that! 
  [Vurusic] Although the official election results have not 
come in yet, you have already received Vojislav Seselj's 
telegram from Belgrade congratulating you on your victory, while 
the representatives of your party also visited him in 
Belgrade.... 
  [Zhebrovskiy] I have not seen that telegram yet, and there 
is nothing I can tell you about it. Still, Zhirinovskiy was in 
Belgrade, and, as far as I know, he did meet Seselj.... 
  [Vurusic] Your party is called a pro-fascist party, and some 
people claim you are maintaining contact with your European 
counterparts. You said yourself that you had contacts with 
Seselj's Radical Party, which is openly pro-fascist.... 
  [Zhebrovskiy] Come on, what kind of fascists are we? You 
have swallowed the propaganda bait of our so-called democrats, 
who are nothing but neo-bolsheviks. They are ready to do 
anything to stay in power. They are in a panic that they might 
lose it. They have brought such a powerful country as Russia to 
its knees, and now they are allowing the Americans to exploit it 
for miserable amounts of money in return. We want to see Russia 
on its feet again, in all its grandeur and beauty. Therefore 
they are afraid of us, and are trying to blacken us by calling 
us fascists, chauvinists, racists, and anti-Semites. They are 
even ready to trigger a civil war! Do you know how far they are 
going? They are even lying to our President Boris Yeltsin, and 
blocking his actions. They are constantly misinforming him, 
because the television is in their hands, and they prevent 
anyone telling President Yeltsin what the real state of affairs 
is. They are now in a terrible panic, because they are afraid 
of Yeltsin's personally meeting someone who will tell him the 
truth straight to his face, without reluctance. That man is 
Zhirinovskiy! 
  [Vurusic] To return to the subject of former Yugoslavia, and 
your attitude toward the international initiatives to end the 
war.... 
  [Zhebrovskiy] We are against that war, and I think that 
Yugoslavia is the first drill-ground where the method of 
crushing and partitioning a state organized according to the 
national-territorial principle has been tested. We are against 
such a state organization. The best way to organize a state is 
on the territorial principle, not the national principle. 
Cultural autonomy -- yes, but no state should allow 
national-territorial autonomy! There cannot exist several 
states in one state. For instance, we support the idea that in 
Russia the question of national affiliation should be completely 
abolished. We do not ask our members about their national 
affiliation. Foreign journalists are always surprised when we 
say that we are not able to throw light on the national 
structure of the Liberal Democratic Party, because we simply do 
not ask anybody about it. What some people want to see 
happening on the larger scale, in Russia, is already happening 
in Yugoslavia, on a smaller scale. We also have Christian and 
Muslim factors here, and those people want to make them collide. 
  [Vurusic] Still, it seems that you see the greatest danger 
in the Muslims.... 
  [Zhebrovskiy] Look at what is happening near Russia, on its 
southern borders. Turkey claims millions of square kilometers 
of regions which were under Russian jurisdiction for many 
centuries and which have become independent states by some 
treacherous miracle. Turkish expansionism wants Azerbaijan, 
Armenia, the greatest part of our Central Asian regions. 
Turkish expansionism also involves the region of former 
Yugoslavia, however, and the bells may soon toll for Bulgaria as 
well. We think that such a young religion as Islam -- which is 
radical and impatient -- is the greatest danger. A young 
religion is just like a young man: ungovernable and assertive. 
Christianity is like a mature man: wise and restrained. We are 
divided by 700 years. Just remember early Christianity: wars, 
crusades, inquisition.... Such things do not exist any more. 
Therefore the Muslims are sending their followers to wage 
wars.... 
  [Vurusic] How do you view the Muslim state in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina today? 
  [Zhebrovskiy] It must not be allowed. Your Muslims are 
largely assisted by the Arab and other Islamic countries with 
weapons and oil, while those countries even represent 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in various international forums. If there 
were no such and similar aid, there would be far fewer problems 
in the region, and they would be easily solved. 
  [Vurusic] Quite probably, because there would be nothing 
the Muslims could fight with. 
  [Zhebrovskiy] It seems as though you did not understand what 
the Muslims want. I also find the behavior of the West quite 
incomprehensible. Look what the greatest Western cities are 
turning into! Mosques are mushrooming in all the cities where 
the Western Christian culture was conceived. There is the smell 
of roast mutton everywhere on the streets. Just look at Munich, 
Berlin, Amsterdam. By the turn of the century the number of 
Muslims in Paris will have exceeded the number of Frenchmen. 
Where is this leading? One should look at the future. I ask 
you: Who will then be considered a foreigner by whom? A 
Frenchman by an Arab, or an Arab by a Frenchman? The West does 
not understand what is happening in former Yugoslavia. The 
Western culture is absolutely different from the Eastern culture. 
  [Vurusic] Then, are you still in favor or the Serbs' 
retaining the occupied territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia? 
  [Zhebrovskiy] The most important thing is that peace is 
established there, and that blood is no longer shed. In order 
to accomplish that, however, perhaps one will have to implement 
some violent measures. It is better to destroy the source of 
evil now than let it spread and develop. 
  [Vurusic] Who and what do you think is that evil you are 
talking about? 
  [Zhebrovskiy] I will not discuss the details. It is 
politics we are discussing now! It is not pursued by giving 
interviews. It involves lengthy negotiations, compromises, 
persuasion, interests. We should go for peace, for cooperation. 
Not all the people are able to understand everything that can 
happen. And in large part it is already happening in former 
Yugoslavia. When two cultures meet, the later one starts to 
feel stronger, or at least capable of imposing itself on the 
other. If that problem is not settled, the war will last at 
least another 30 years: You have a lot of mountains there, the 
peoples are bellicose, and weapons will be coming in. 
  [Vurusic] Are you an anti-Muslim racist, in view of what you 
have just said? 
  [Zhebrovskiy] Of course I am not! I am just warning of the 
danger, but I am not calling for a war against them. Besides, 
until recently I did not even know that our party has many 
Muslim members. When public opinion started denouncing us, 
alleging that we are anti-Muslim racists, our Muslim members 
felt the need to say publicly that it was not true. 
  [Vurusic] In a recent interview for Radio Hamburg, 
Zhirinovskiy said that there could be another Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki in Japan, but this time Russia would drop the bombs. 
How does that fit in with the appeals for peace and cooperation 
you called for after the elections? 
  [Zhebrovskiy] I was not present when that interview was 
given, so I am not able to explain what the statement actually 
means. I have been present during many of Zhirinovskiy's 
appearances, but I have never heard him say anything like that. 
However, we first have to see the context in which that 
statement was made. Perhaps it was taken out of context. 
Perhaps he was asked what he would do if Japan attacked us. We 
have to check what was said before and after that statement. 
Nevertheless, in this case I dare say it is a pure lie. 
  [Vurusic] It is said that your party is sending volunteers 
to Iraq, to help Saddam Husayn, as well as to Serbia.... 
  [Zhebrovskiy] That is yet another piece of misinformation. 
No member of ours has ever been sent by our party to volunteer 
there. 
  [Vurusic] Still, there are Russians fighting on the side of 
the Serbs.... 
  [Zhebrovskiy] We have never sent anybody there. 
  [Vurusic] Would you send the Russian Army to intervene in 
former Yugoslavia? 
  [Zhebrovskiy] Zhirinovskiy's statement is clear: Not a 
single Russian soldier will fight in a foreign country any 
longer. We shall withdraw our army from all the countries 
where its troops have been stationed. 
  [Vurusic] How do you assess the fact that most of the 
Russian soldiers serving with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in 
Croatia voted for your party? 
  [Zhebrovskiy] They have understood that our party will help 
to make it possible for them to leave that region as soon as 
possible. 
  [Vurusic] Does that mean that you will officially demand 
that Russia withdraw its UNPROFOR troops from Croatia? 
  [Zhebrovskiy] We shall make public our attitude in that 
respect very soon, and propose it to all the major states in the 
world. One has to make radical changes in the approach to the 
Yugoslav crisis. One ought finally to tell the truth about what 
is happening there! 
  [Vurusic] What is the truth? 
  [Zhebrovskiy] The nationalistic games, plundering of assets, 
and geopolitical games of Germany, America, and Arabia. Many 
people will feel quite uncomfortable when we put forward our 
proposal, both in the East and the West. You can expect our 
proposal to come soon. 
<H5>  Vengerovskiy: When We Won, Panic Broke Out in the World! </H5>
  [Vurusic] I am sitting in the foyer of the office usually 
occupied by Zhirinovskiy. After his celebratory news conference 
he took a vacation and left Moscow, refusing interviews and 
public appearances, and surrendering a part of his unexpected 
fame to his closest aides and veterans, who are ironically 
referred to by Moscow's democratic circles as "veterans of 
Moscow's stinking beer-cellars," an allusion to Munich's 
beer-cellars from where Adolph Hitler set out into the world of 
politics. 
  I am waiting to be received by the second most important man 
of the party, Aleksandr Dmitriyevich Vengerovskiy, head of the 
party's intelligence-security service, whom Zhirinovskiy intends 
to propose to President Yeltsin as prime minister of the Russian 
Government. 
  On the wall behind Vengerovskiy, right above his head, hangs 
the map of Russia as conceived by Zhirinovskiy: From Finland to 
Alaska, while the prominent detail on the map is an eagle, 
holding in his beak a banner reading Freedom and Law, which is, 
according to Vengerovskiy, the goal of the party's policy. 
Right at the beginning of the interview he feels it necessary 
to say that the war in former Yugoslavia is not the most 
important thing in the world. Russian citizens have many severe 
problems, and their greatest priority now is to solve them. 
Besides, he says, he does not conceal his former membership in 
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and, unlike many other 
people, he neither kept his membership card hidden nor did he 
burn it. Therefore the first question is whether he feels sorry 
that the Soviet Union has ceased to exist. 
  [Vengerovskiy] I feel sorry that Soviet Union disintegrated. 
We were the only party in Russia that condemned that act. I 
think that from that moment on Russia has been going downhill, 
and given our success in the elections, Russia and the Russian 
people have been given a chance to change the situation. 
  [Vurusic] Do you think that Russia today does not occupy the 
place it deserves on the international political stage? 
  [Vengerovskiy] Of course I do! What was the Soviet Union 
before? An important political factor, a superpower, while now 
it is a giant on its knees. Because of the policy that has been 
pursued so far Russia has become a state of second-rate 
importance. In Russia the death rate is higher than the birth 
rate! We are a state without international borders. Our 
historical borders are now thousands of kilometers away from 
Russia, although borders, according to the Helsinki document, 
are irrevocable. 
  [Vurusic] Do you understand the former Soviet Union as 
Russia? 
  [Vengerovskiy] And what do you think it was? The Soviet 
Union was founded on the territory of the Russian Empire, some 
peoples were given national autonomy, and look now -- they are 
independent states! Russia has been left without access to sea, 
without large harbors. We have slid back into medieval Russia. 
Do you think that is normal? Of course it is not! Therefore 
we want to restore dignity and esteem to our fatherland, and to 
make it take the place again that belongs to it in the world. 
  [Vurusic] Does this mean you want the Russia represented by 
the map above your armchair, including Finland, Poland, and 
Alaska? 
  [Vengerovskiy] That is Russia in its best and most famous 
days. We are in favor of having neighborly relations with all 
countries, but we shall demand the revocation of aid and the 
privileged status in the sphere of economic relations that was 
bestowed on those former Soviet republics whose policy we find 
unsatisfactory. Of course, we shall elaborate the program of 
aid and privileges for other countries, as well as regulations 
the disregarding of which might lead to revocation of those 
privileges. This means that our attitude toward those republics 
will depend on their behavior. These are normal relations in 
international foreign policy. 
  [Vurusic] What will your contribution to Russian foreign 
policy be? 
  [Vengerovskiy] It will be as large as possible! Earlier, 
Russia's word used to count, its opinion was important, and it 
was fully taken into account in international relations. We 
shall do all we can to make things like that again. You see, as 
soon as we won, journalists from all over the world flocked to 
Moscow, because panic broke out in the world. That panic means 
that from now on the world will be paying more attention to 
Russia's opinion. Let me paraphrase Earnest Hemingway: "When 
the bell tolls, perhaps it tolls for you!" 
  [Vurusic] I have to ask you a question regarding the war in 
Yugoslavia, particularly because you support the Serbian side.... 
  [Vengerovskiy] We usually find out what has been happening 
in former Yugoslavia from our members who have been there. 
Personally, I have been best informed by the author Edward 
Lymonov. You know from history that our Slav brothers, Serbs 
and Montenegrins, have always been close to us! We are bound 
together historically. We also know that Croats are Slavs as 
well. But the Serbs are much closer to us, because they are 
Christian-Orthodox. We have defended them many times. What is 
happening in former Yugoslavia right now is absolutely abnormal! 
It is a religious war! Let us say "No!" to all your nation 
states! We do not want Russia to be founded on the national 
principle. Let Yugoslavia be founded, as was Russia before, or 
as the United States is now, on the principle of states 
[gubernija]. 
<H3>  Vsevold Gaplyn: In the Russian Christian-Orthodox Church We 
Have Monarchists, and Even Communists! </H3>
  [Vurusic] In the last few years, after decades of the Soviet 
authorities, the Russian Christian Orthodox Church has started 
to reassume the place it had for many centuries. Many churches 
were demolished, most of the clergy were expelled, and believers 
were imprisoned. Even the very top of the Russian Christian 
Orthodox Church was controlled by the almighty KGB. 
  On the eve of the recent bloody events in the Russian 
Parliament, the Russian Christian Orthodox Church and its 
patriarch, Aleksey II, were mediators in the negotiations 
between the conflicting factions. 
  The mediating mission failed, which, as is said, was taken 
quite badly among church officials. They even consider that the 
church has missed a chance to win the political and religious 
place in Russian society it had at the time of the empire, when 
Orthodoxy was recognized as the official state religion. 
  Although church officials deny it, the Russian Christian 
Orthodox Church exerts significant influence on the politics of 
other Christian Orthodox churches, so that after the outbreak of 
war in former Yugoslavia, several meetings took place between 
Pavle, patriarch of the Serbian Christian-Orthodox Church, and 
Patriarch Aleksey II. 
  In Danilovskiy monastery, which dates from the 13th century 
and is now the home of the Department of Foreign Church Affairs 
of the Patriarch of Russian Christian Orthodox Church, we are 
talking with father Vsevold Gaplyn, head of inter-church 
cooperation and relations with international organizations. 
  Danilovskiy monastery was nationalized right after the 
revolution in 1917, and until 1983, when it was given back to 
the church, it had been a prison for the children of political 
prisoners. 
  What is the role of the Russian Christian Orthodox Church 
today, given the changed political conditions? 
  [Gaplyn] The church wants to act in a pacifying way, and our 
main task is the salvation of human souls. If people are 
suffering, the church has to protect them and take care of them. 
If people are living well, and in compliance with the laws of 
God, then church-state relations will also be good. You are 
aware of the recent tragic events, caused by the political 
crisis in society and in the relations between the former 
parliament and President Yeltsin. In that situation we tried to 
play a peacekeeping role, and at one moment it appeared to us 
that our mission would be successful, but unfortunately, human 
malice and mutual intolerance, as well as destructive and 
murderous instincts were stronge, and brought about tragic 
events. Regardless of such an outcome, however, the Russian 
Christian Orthodox Church will always support peace, and strive 
for it. Our authority in society is great and indisputable, and 
for that reason we are becoming a desirable ally of many 
political forces. The church, however, is above politics, it is 
above political conflicts. It cannot be otherwise, because the 
church itself involves monarchists, and even communists. 
  [Vurusic] Regarding the war that is going on in Croatia 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina, many people maintain, even some in 
Russia, that it is a religious war, because its warring factions 
are Catholic, Muslim, and Christian Orthodox.... 
  [Gaplyn] As far as I know, the highest officials of the 
Serbian Christian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church reject 
any notion that a religious war is being waged in former 
Yugoslavia. In their letters and addresses to believers both 
Cardinal Kuharic and Patriarch Pavle are interceding for peace. 
We in the Russian Orthodox Church also think that the roots and 
reasons for that terrible war in former Yugoslavia are of 
political origin, rather than religious. As for the relations 
between the Russian and Serbian Orthodox Churches, I have to 
underline that they are very close and brotherly, because the 
language of our service is the same. The Russian church 
completely supports the Serbian church in this war. We are very 
happy to see that the representatives of the Serbian church are 
cooperating and making efforts to find the path of peace 
together with the officials of the Catholic Church in Croatia! 
  [Vurusic] The Serbs often boast about their Orthodox 
brotherhood with Russians and Russia, considering it their great 
protector, no matter what they do. Do you think that such 
boasting might sometimes damage the Russian Orthodox Church's 
reputation? 
  [Gaplyn] Our relationship with the Serbian people is 
brotherly. We understand their hopes and expectations. Still, 
that brotherhood must not be understood as support for conduct 
that opposes Christian morality and peace efforts. 
  [Vurusic] The Serbian church happens to be in the center of 
yet another problem. That is the demand that the Macedonian and 
Montenegrin Orthodox Churches be independent, and have their own 
patriarch.... 
  [Gaplyn] From the point of view of ordinary Christian 
Orthodoxy, there is no such thing as an autocephalous Macedonian 
Orthodox Church! No such thing is recognized by any of the 
existing orthodox churches in the world. In that point the 
Russian church supports its Serbian counterpart. I think that 
the question of the independence of a particular church 
structure cannot be solved by overthrowing the economic 
structure of the church, as has happened in Macedonia, or in 
Ukraine. As for the Montenegrin situation, I see no reason for 
the Montenegrins to have church independence at all! 
  [Vurusic] A considerable number of orthodox believers live 
in Croatia, so there are even suggestions that a sort of 
Croatian orthodox church should be founded. What would be the 
Russian Orthodox Church's reaction to that? 
  [Gaplyn] I am not familiar with such suggestions. 
Nevertheless, it would be the following: There are church 
parishes, and they are administratively connected. Since 
certain Croatian parishes are economically linked to the Serbian 
church and Patriarch Pavle, it is logical that the Serbian 
church's opinion should be taken into account. Only with its 
permission could a part of its territorial property be given a 
certain degree of independence. 
  [Vurusic] Do you have any contact with Cardinal Kuharic, and 
the representatives of the Captol [site of cathedral] in Zagreb? 
  [Gaplyn] No, we do not, but we would like to have contact 
with Cardinal Kuharic, and the Zagreb Captol, so that we could 
obtain more information. Some time ago I met the 
representatives of the Croatian Protestant Church in Barcelona. 
It was a very instructive and interesting conversation. We 
found a common language also in our desire to see peace in your 
country as soon as possible. 
  [Vurusic] What are your relations with the Vatican today? 
  [Gaplyn] Somehow in 1988 and 1989 relations with the Vatican 
worsened. At that time Catholic evangelism started in Russia, 
and the missionaries did not always behave properly. As we see 
it, they did not always act in compliance with our mutual 
vocation on earth, they did not always behave in accordance with 
their laws. They did not take account of our Russian pride, our 
tradition and culture, but just this year it appears that 
relations with the Vatican have started to improve.

  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- 305 Russian paratroopers 
with weapons and equipment left late on Wednesday [5 January] to 
reinforce the Russian battalion of "blue helmets" ensuring peace 
on the border between Krajina Serb and Croatia. 
  It is for the first time that the Russian peace-keepers will 
be armed with mortars, anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft 
weapons. Earlier the Russian soldiers had only firearms with 
them. 
  The service of the Russian airborne troops told TASS on 
Thursday that the paratroopers were dispatched upon a request of 
the commander of the UN peace-keeping forces in former 
Yugoslavia and with the knowledge of the UN Security Council. 
  It added that it is hard for the current strength of the 
Russian battalion to fulfil its mission on the border between 
Krajina Serb and Croatia. The zone monitored by the Russian 
force is 100 kilometres long and 30 kilometres wide and has 24 
checkpoints. 
  Both Croats and Serbs regularly violate ceasefire there. 
  The train with paratroopers is expected to arrive in place 
on 
January 9.

tendencies appearing within the Commonwealth, with the growing 
understanding of the need and inevitability of integrational 
processes. 
  As chairman of the CIS Heads of State Council, Yeltsin 
stressed the importance of stepping up the formation of a 
full-blooded and effective economic union and of strengthening 
collective security. 
  The sides also discussed some organisational measures, 
intended to consolidate the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
to enhance its authority on the international arena.

  [Text] On Wednesday [5 January] in the Kremlin, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin received Ivan Korotchenya, the CIS 
Executive Secretary. 
  INTERFAX has learned that during their 40-minute 
conversation 
they discussed concrete issues aimed at the strengthening and 
development of the Commonwealth. They noted that by joint 
efforts they would manage to overcome crisis phenomena and the 
prolonged strip of failures in economic development experienced 
by majority of countries. 
  During the meeting they paid great attention to the problems 
of the Economic union. In particular, they pointed out that 
there was still no legal basis for this union. The participants 
of the talks stressed the necessity to speed up formation of 
payment union in the multi-currency system and parallel 
initializing of important documents to create a free trade 
regime. 
  Korotchenya asked Yeltsin, who will chair the CIS in the 
first half of 1994, to set forth proposals concerning creation 
of inter-state structures to ensure activity of the economic 
union. 
  Yeltsin and Korotchenya also discussed issues related to 
practical implementation of the Collective Security Treaty. 
  On the eve of this meeting Korotchenya sent a letter to 
Yeltsin in which he proposes to prolong the term granted to 
heads of states to make a decision concerning formation of 
collective peacemaking forces and their functioning which is to 
expire on March 24, 1994.

  [Text] Moscow January 5 TASS -- Russia and Belarus agreed 
on Wednesday [5 January] to merge their monetary systems as of 
mid-January, 1994 and make the Russian rouble the only legal 
tender in both republics. 
  The decision was reached during the Russian-Belarusian talks 
in Moscow which were attended by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Belarusian 
Premier Vyacheslav Kebich. 
  The participants signed a joint statement on the integration 
of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. The statement 
said that the integration will take place after the prime 
ministers of the two republics have signed a package of more 
than ten agreements specifying the mechanism of integration in 
Minsk in the second half of January. 
  Kebich told ITAR-TASS after the three-hour talks that the 
sides have also agreed the exchange rate of the Russian rouble 
and the Belarusian coupon under which one coupon will be 
exchanged for one rouble. 
  Kebich also said that Yeltsin expressed the hope that the 
agreements to be signed in Minsk will come into force as soon as 
possible. "This would fully meet the interests of the heads of 
government," he added. 
  The Belarusian premier believes that the process of 
Belarus's 
transition to the Russian rouble will be long and may take three 
to six months. This is caused mostly by technical problems of 
cash supplies to Belarus. Kebich said some other CIS states may 
also join the rouble zone. "But for this to happen, a certain 
mechanism should be worked out," he concluded.

  [Text] Moscow January 5 TASS -- "A statement signed by the 
heads of the Russian and Belarusian governments in Moscow today 
on the merger of the monetary systems of the two countries is an 
important landmark we sought to achieve," said Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin during a brief conversation with 
journalists after the ceremony of signing the document was over. 
  The Russian prime minister pointed out in reply to a 
question asked by ITAR-TASS that "today, Russia and Belarus have 
not only come up close to the merger of their monetary systems, 
but to the deepening of economic integration in the CIS 
framework." 
  Chernomyrdin pointed out that the creation of the single 
rouble space between the two countries has a mutually 
advantageous character, adding that "none of us is seeking to 
gain any advantage at each other's expense". The prime minister 
declared that "by signing today's statement, Russia does not 
encroach on Belarusian sovereignty. The document is aimed at 
deepening the coordination of our activities in the economic 
sphere and this is the principle followed by the whole Europe in 
its development." 
  As a result of Russo-Belarusian talks held in the building 
of the Russian Government on Wednesday, Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
Vyacheslav Kebich signed an agreement on trade and economic 
cooperation in 1994. Vice-premiers of the two countries, 
Aleksandr Shokhin and Vladimir Zalomay, signed an agreement on 
supplies of Russian natural gas to Belarus and the construction 
of a system of gas pipelines on the Belarusian territory.

  [Text] Russia must become a member of NATO before East 
European countries and Lithuania do so. Journalists were told 
this by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich after his 
talks with Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian government. 
The Belarusian prime minister believes that this step will make 
it possible to avoid military-political polarization in Europe. 
In this connection, Vyacheslav Kebich thinks that after 
Russia's admission to NATO Belarus may also become a member of 
the bloc. He stated that the question of the position of the 
two countries in respect of joining NATO will be discussed 
during the visit to Moscow next week by Stanislav Shushkevich, 
chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. This was reported by 
INTERFAX.

  [Text] In the first days of the new year, Andrey Nikolayev, 
commander of the Russian Federation's border troops, met 
President of Azerbaijan Geydar Aliyev in Baku and visited the 
Council of Ministers of the Republic of Dagestan. The trip is 
linked to the very difficult issues of guarding CIS state 
borders and of the security of internal borders and those with 
non-CIS states. 
  [Begin recording] [Andrey Nikolayev interviewed aboard 
plane, 
in flight] For two years there have been no serious, substantial 
contacts with Azerbaijan, with our colleagues in Azerbaijan, on 
the border issue. Much has been lost, but luckily not 
everything and an important result of the meeting in Azerbaijan 
was the fact that our colleagues in Azerbaijan and the president 
of Azerbaijan showed thorough understanding of the problems 
outlined by the Russian side -- Azerbaijan's entry into the CIS 
and joining the collective security treaty. Russia's goodwill 
and wish to provide for the national interests of Azerbaijan and 
Russia, and to protect the interests of other CIS states where 
Azerbaijan and Russia are concerned, create the conditions for 
settling the questions we are faced with. [end recording]

  [Text] United Nations January 5 TASS -- The U.N. General 
Assembly circulated as its official document a statement by the 
Russian Foreign Ministry in connection with the adoption by the 
Latvian Parliament of a law on elections to the bodies of local 
self-government. 
  The statement said that despite the inside and outside 
criticism, the Latvian Parliament has adopted the second reading 
of the draft law on the elections to the bodies of local 
self-government. The draft deprives non-residents of Latvia of 
not only their passive but also active franchise, introduces 
language restrictions for non-ethnic Latvians (the right to run 
public elections will be granted only to the candidates who pass 
examinations in the Latvian language) and creates barriers (by 
nationality) for the nomination of candidates in Riga and other 
big cities with a large percentage of non-ethnic residents. 
  The statement also pointed out that Latvian lawmakers 
continue to ignore recommendations by experts of the Council of 
Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE), including CSCE Supreme Commissioner for Ethnic 
Minorities Max van der Stoel who consider as inadmissible the 
removal of non-residents who account for a considerable part of 
the country's population (several hundred thousand people) from 
participation in local self- government. 
  Because Russia's position at the bilateral talks has 
received 
no response from its partners, the Russian Foreign Ministry has 
to draw the attention of the world community and human rights 
organisations to the growing discriminatory policy in Latvia 
aimed against non-ethnic residents, primarily Russians. Before 
it is too late, it is necessary to do everything possible to 
prevent aggressive nationalism from thriving in the Baltics. 
This will pose a threat to Europe of which Russia has 
repeatedly warned, the statement said.

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant General Dmitriy Kharchenko under the </F>
"On Eve of Event" rubric: "What To Expect from the Meeting in 
Brussels"] 
  [Text] A session of the NATO Council opens in Brussels, 
the Belgian capital, 10 January at the level of the heads of 
state and government of the member countries of this 
military-political organization. It is proposed that two main 
issues will be at the center of the session's attention: how to 
resolve problems of international security, and how to treat the 
request from a number of Central and East European states for 
admission to membership of the North Atlantic Alliance. It will 
essentially be discussing the future of this alliance in the 
modern world. 
  On the eve of the NATO summit it seems expedient to examine 
the question of Russia's relationship with NATO. But before 
trying to find the answer to it, I believe that we should 
consider the following: 
  A truly paradoxical situation has taken shape. Practically 
everyone in the West believes that the North Atlantic Alliance 
was the undoubted winner of the Cold War. At the same time this 
alliance has probably never before been faced with such acute 
and intractable problems. It is even said that NATO is 
experiencing a kind of crisis. 
  The bloc's critical state is all the more surprising because 
it followed directly on the outburst of euphoria which in the 
West accompanied the fall of the Berlin Wall, the dissolution of 
the Warsaw Pact, and the breakup of the Soviet Union. At the 
London meeting in the summer of 1990 the state and government 
leaders of the alliance countries welcomed the changes in Europe 
enthusiastically and even called them historic. Then suddenly a 
crisis. What is going on here? 
  The point is that NATO in the form in which it was created 
in 
the late forties is practically played out. The "threat from 
the East" has disappeared. The enemy has disappeared. Yet that 
is precisely what the bloc organizers needed not only to 
implement the policy of "containing and rolling back" communism 
but, above all, to consolidate the leading role of the United 
States in the postwar world. For long years the bloc's chief 
function was to be the instrument of Washington's policy and to 
involve other Western countries in it. 
  There is more. Having rid itself of real or imaginary fears 
of a "massive attack from the east," NATO has found itself 
facing new and this time very real dangers. These are the 
unstable situation in Russia (let us recall the pained reaction 
of some people in the West to the results of the parliamentary 
elections in our country) and also in other states which have 
emerged on the territory of the former USSR, the possibility of 
the uncontrolled spread of weapons of mass destruction, and, 
finally, the interethnic and ethnic conflicts on the periphery 
of the bloc, which are escalating into fierce armed clashes, as 
has already happened in Yugoslavia, Moldova, and the Caucasus. 
How is NATO to react to all these dangers, and what can it and 
must it do under these conditions? 
  The top-level NATO meeting is to indicate an answer to this 
question. 
  All this also directly concerns Russia, Particularly as the 
question of expanding the NATO framework by admitting a number 
of East European countries to this organization's ranks is 
arising very acutely. Every state's sovereign right to choose 
the forms and means of ensuring its security which best suit it 
has to be respected. But NATO's leading circles know of 
Moscow's negative attitude to the prospect of the alliance's 
accelerated expansion. This might not resolve existing problems 
but create new ones. For example, it might undermine the 
established legal treaty system on our continent -- above all, 
the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Instead of 
strengthening trust and stability, new seeds of mistrust would 
thereby be sown -- which would undoubtedly lead to the 
destabilization of the whole situation. 
  The expansion of NATO's zone of responsibility will 
directly affect Russia's interests for geopolitical, military, 
and also internal political reasons. As a result of the 
alliance's expansion the bloc's military grouping -- the 
largest in the world -- will reach lines close to Russian 
borders. This will require a fundamental reappraisal of all our 
defensive concepts, a reshaping of the armed forces, a revision 
of the operational apportionment of theaters of military 
operations, the deployment of additional infrastructure, the 
relocation of large military contingents, and changes in 
operational plans and the nature of combat training. 
  It is also easy to imagine that both the leadership and the 
public of Russia would perceive the widening of the circle of 
NATO members as an attempt to isolate us and to create a "cordon 
sanitaire" on our western borders. It would not be out of place 
to remark that this could promote the emergence of xenophobia in 
our society and strengthen the influence of right-wing radical 
nationalist parties and organizations. 
  This, however, is the opinion not only of Russians. It was 
no coincidence that the influential German newspaper DIE WELT 
wrote recently that a desire to recreate the Iron Curtain to cut 
themselves off from an unstable neighbor -- Russia -- lies 
behind all the attempts to expand NATO to the east. 
  Leading NATO circles also understand the delicacy of this 
situation. To all appearances they are in no hurry to admit new 
members, despite insistent requests from Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltic states, and a number of 
other East European countries. The U.S. President has advanced 
as an alternative an idea which has been named "partnership for 
peace." I believe that Russia could support this idea insofar as 
it takes into account the security interests of all states 
without exception. Of course, this partnership should be geared 
to forming unified security standards throughout the 
Euro-Atlantic area. The priority development of a political 
dialogue, constant consultations, the attainment of concerted 
positions, and, in the long term, coordinated actions constitute 
genuine partnership. 
  At their sessions in early December the NATO countries' 
foreign and defense ministers confirmed their support for the 
"partnership for peace" plan advanced by Washington. 
Nevertheless, the essence of this plan and the ways of 
implementing it are still insufficiently clear. Obviously, 
these questions will be the object of close examination at the 
upcoming NATO Council session, and we would very much like its 
participants to take the Russian viewpoint on this problem into 
consideration. Of course, what will be decided in Brussels will 
also be discussed at the meeting of the Russian and U.S. 
presidents to be held in the next few days. 
  All this certainly does not mean that an insurmountable gulf 
lies between Russia and NATO. This was shown by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's recent meeting with NATO Secretary 
General Manfred Woerner. It was pointed out there, in 
particular, that an objective assessment of Russia's role in 
ensuring international security and stability requires its 
relations with the North Atlantic Alliance to outstrip the 
relations between the latter and the Central and East European 
countries in terms of pace, volume, and richness. 
  It is notable that we can already see compatibility in terms 
of a number of basic aims in the military-political concepts of 
Russia and the NATO countries. This is being promoted both by 
the deideologization of international relations and by the 
coincidence of the sides' views on the main problems of ensuring 
security. 
  Both sides give priority in this sphere to political 
methods. 
The use of military force is regarded as an exceptional measure, 
permissible only in the interests of self-defense and also in 
peacemaking operations. Both the "new NATO strategic concept" 
adopted in 1991 and the recently approved "Main Provisions of 
the Russian Federation's Military Doctrine" contain 
exceptionally important points: No state or coalition is 
regarded as an enemy by either the North Atlantic Alliance or 
Russia. Both documents recognize that the limitation and 
reduction of arms accord with the national interests of all 
states and help strengthen universal security. It is possible 
to say that this opens up a real opportunity to eliminate the 
residual elements of military confrontation in Europe. 
  Unfortunately, such elements do still exist. Whereas Russia 
is carrying out a thorough reform of its Armed Forces, having 
already significantly reduced their strength and intending to 
continue moving in this direction, the NATO countries' military 
activity is still being reduced only slowly. It was pointed out 
at a recent session of the bloc's Military Planning Committee 
that the strength of the member countries' armed forces has been 
reduced by just 15 percent over the past few years, while 
military spending still amounts to 3.2 percent of GNP. And this 
in the absence of a real enemy! 
  But the following question arises: If NATO's expansion 
appears inexpedient -- let us put it that way -- from Russia's 
viewpoint today and if everything is not yet clear with the 
"partnership for peace" plan, is there any way out of the 
situation which is taking shape? Obviously there is, and maybe 
not just one. It is possible, for example, to point to the 
further enhancement of the role and significance of the activity 
of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC]. It already 
unites 38 states -- both NATO and former Warsaw Pact members, 
including, of course, the Russian Federation. Russia actively 
participates in NACC sessions at the foreign minister level, and 
its representatives from the Defense Ministry participate in the 
work of various commissions, seminars, and courses within the 
framework of this organization. 
  This framework, however, is still quite limited. Obviously, 
the time is coming to expand it considerably. There is a real 
opportunity to turn the NACC into an organization for collective 
security in Europe. This would not mean lessening the role of 
the CSCE but, thanks to the fact that far fewer states 
participate in the work of the NACC than in the CSCE, it is 
easier to arrive at mutually acceptable decisions there and to 
make these decisions more effective and more consonant with 
urgent tasks and with the demands of the situation. 
  It would not be out of place to remind you here that all the 
members of the NACC understand this. A recent NACC meeting 
adopted a statement which spoke of measures to further 
strengthen cooperation within the framework of this 
organization. It sets itself the task of continuing and 
activating consultations on political questions and questions 
connected with ensuring security, as well as developing 
cooperation on military questions. In particular, a new working 
plan for dialogue, partnership, and cooperation in 1994 was 
approved for this purpose. 
  Why should emphasis be placed on organizations such as the 
NACC, let us say? Why cannot the functions of ensuring regional 
security be entrusted to NATO? Because the North Atlantic 
Alliance was created as a specific organization of leading 
Western countries under definite conditions and with quite 
definite aims. But the conditions have changed decisively. 
  It seems beyond doubt that any attempts to transform NATO 
can 
change virtually nothing in its essence. The North Atlantic 
Alliance remains yesterday's organization. It is not its 
modernization that must be on the agenda, but the abandonment of 
bloc thinking in favor of an effective and efficient system of 
European and international security. It is evidently time to 
breathe vital force into the fertile idea of creating a security 
system "from Vancouver to Vladivostok" and to prepare and set in 
motion the appropriate mechanism. 
  These are the views I would like to share on the eve of the 
NATO summit with regard to the serious problem of the 
relationship between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance.

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko "Commentary": "Meeting Point of Eastern </F>
and Western Interests"] 
  [Text] The idea of expanding NATO to encompass countries 
in Central and East Europe seemed to have been buried once and 
for all in Brussels, where a session of the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council [NACC] was held in early December. But the 
unexpected success in the parliamentary elections of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's party, voicing ultraradical views of restoring 
the USSR and of the new Russia's foreign policy "added fuel" to 
the smoldering fire. First in Vilnius the Baltic Council of the 
three former Soviet republics asked for guarantees from the 
West, then the nerve of politicians in Poland, the Czech 
Republic, and Hungary failed. "Poland will press for the 
countries of East Europe to be admitted to NATO most speedily," 
Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said. "Acceding to 
NATO could be a means for Hungary and other countries in the 
region to reliably join Europe and provide weighty guarantees of 
security and stability," Hungary's new prime minister, Peter 
Boross, stressed at a 22 December press conference. 
  Europe calmed down somewhat after Boris Yeltsin's statement 
regarding the immutability of Russia's foreign policy and the 
announcement of the Federal Assembly election results: The 
rumor of the overwhelming victory won by the Liberal Democratic 
Party and the national-patriots proved somewhat exaggerated. 
But the question of NATO's possible eastward progress has not 
been withdrawn once and for all. What is more, Russian 
diplomacy is confronted with new tasks. First, organizing 
reliable contacts with Federal Assembly deputies, who are 
already seen to be not at all inclined to toe the executive 
line. Second, proposing a clear program for cooperation with 
all-European structures. A base for this is in place: During 
his recent visit to Brussels Boris Yeltsin signed an 
all-embracing political declaration on cooperation with the 
European Union -- a declaration that has made it possible to 
view with hope the prospects for Russia's economic relations 
with the EU. But there is no such treaty with the Council of 
Europe, the Western European Union, or NATO. 
  Dialogue with the NACC opens up extensive opportunities in 
this connection. Set up three years ago, it is in our view 
fully justifying its existence during the transition from 
confrontation to East-West partnership. "The NACC is unique in 
that it operates at the meeting point of the interests of West, 
Central, and East Europe," Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, rightly pointed out at the Council session in 
Brussels. For NATO countries it provides an opportunity to 
transform the North Atlantic alliance with consideration for the 
radically changing nature of the threats to European and 
international peace. It provides Russia and other countries in 
the former USSR with a practical mechanism for partnership with 
their former adversaries in the most sensitive sphere of 
security. For the countries of Central and East Europe it means 
an opportunity to eliminate the sense of a certain "security 
vacuum" without expanding NATO. What is more, there is an 
interest common to all -- that of jointly countering new 
challenges to peace and stability on our continent.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "Lech Walesa: The Russian Bear </F>
Cannot Be Tamed"] 
  [Text] "The Americans want to tame the bear, forgetting 
that this cannot be done in the dense forest," Walesa declared 
in an interview in THE WASHINGTON POST. "Russia will never miss 
a good opportunity. Poland has always been just a tidbit to it. 
If the West panders to Russia over trifles today, tomorrow it 
will seize something a bit bigger. If the West does not heed 
Polish arguments, demons will wake up and something similar to 
Yugoslavia will happen." 
  "The `partnership for peace' is a fine idea from the 
viewpoint of the old democracies, but it does not fit the modern 
realities which have taken shape after 50 years of communism." 
  With these words Polish President Lech Walesa cast doubt on 
the hope which the NATO countries were pinning on the "Solomon's 
solution" which seemed to have been found to the problems of the 
bloc's relations with its former opponents in the late Warsaw 
Pact. The "partnership for peace" was to have enabled the 
alliance not to assume excessive obligations with regard to 
ensuring the security of the East European states which have 
embarked on a democratic path, but also not to destroy their 
dream of joining the bloc at some time. The program also made 
it possible to calm down Russia, which had started to get 
agitated on realizing that it might find itself alone, facing a 
"Berlin Wall" moved up to its external borders. 
  As a public opinion poll conducted by GAZETA WYBORCZA 
showed, 
IZVESTIYA's own correspondent L. Kornilov reports, Walesa was 
expressing the opinion of his fellow citizens. Some 70 percent 
of Poles are convinced that Russia threatens Poland militarily, 
65 percent believe that it is also dangerous from the political 
viewpoint, and 53 percent fear economic aggression. Those who 
are 40-50 years old, have some higher education, and are earning 
well fear Russian expansion particularly badly. 
  On the eve of the top-level Brussels meeting, which will 
take 
place 10-11 January, other East European countries have been 
following Poland's example. President Ion Iliescu has sent to 
Brussels a message expressing Romania's wish to join NATO. A 
meeting of the defense ministers of the "Visegrad Group" 
(Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary), at which it 
is proposed to formulate these countries' unified position on 
the program being adopted within NATO, is scheduled for next 
Friday. 
  Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski has held talks in 
Bonn with his German colleague, Klaus Kinkel. Virtually just 
one question was touched on: Poland must obtain guarantees of 
its security and gain a clear idea of how and when it will 
become a full member of NATO. "Everyone who walks like a duck, 
talks like a duck, and looks like a duck has the right to be 
treated like a duck," he told Kinkel, pointing out that Poland 
has traveled a considerable part of the way and can already 
count on a worthy place among the Western countries. 
  Western agencies report that Olechowski's statement about 
the 
duck was received with understanding in Bonn. The whole thing 
was spoiled slightly by the incautious statements of President 
Walesa, who illustrated another saying of Olechowski's about 
"political myths" which render simple things unattainable. 
  The minister included among such "myths" the fears that 
Moscow will remain isolated. But Walesa showed how cool and 
overloaded with suspicion and grudges the relations with the 
former Warsaw Pact allies are -- relations which Russia 
inherited from the times of the USSR's domination of East Europe.

<F P=106> [First article in a series by Virginijus Gaivenis: "Who </F>
Armed National Defense? (1)"] 
  [Excerpts] RESPUBLIKA mentioned the name of Kaunas 
inhabitant Vladas Laurinavicius for the first time in the 
article "In the Tangle of the Kaunas Mafia" published in the 
fall of 1991. We described the cruise of the Kaunas Mafia 
"celebrities" around the Mediterranean. It seems that gathered 
on the ship "Gruzia," the leaders of the Lithuanian-Hong Kong 
enterprise "Grand Queen," who had caused suspicion among law 
enforcement officials for a long time, and their assistants were 
not just resting. The list of holiday-makers surprised the 
officials most of all because it included not only V. 
Laurinavicius, but also Andrius Jankevicius, nicknamed Psidze, 
who is one of the best known persons in the Kaunas criminal 
world, S. Ciapas, president of the closed stock company "Deka," 
and other well-known "businessmen." [passage omitted] 
  The Lithuanian state and its government leaders authorized 
[former] Defense Minister A. Butkevicius to conclude an 
agreement on the purchase of 5,000 machine guns from the Kaunas 
association "Selma" headed by no one else but V. Laurinavicius, 
a person who has been sentenced thrice, like Psidze himself. 
[passage omitted] Today, our law enforcement officials have 
become interested in the activities of this association and its 
ties with the former leaders of the National Defense Ministry 
[KAM]. Maybe, because aircraft and machine guns, as they 
suspect, were bought from Russia for a "nickel," while they were 
"pushed into" the KAM for hundreds of millions [currency 
unspecified]. Prosecutors are trying to assess material losses. 
They are also trying to find out who proposed the Kaunas 
company "Selma" with its president V. Laurinavicius as arms 
suppliers to the government. 
  We will try to base the study of KAM former agreements on 
definite and documented facts in the current publication. 
<H5>  Ship Traders Under Pirates' Siege </H5>
  KAM leaders established the first contacts with "Selma" last 
spring. On 11 May, they concluded an agreement on the 
acquisition of six armed war ships with equipment and 
ammunition. "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius pledged to 
observe it. The KAM leaders made a deal with "Selma" without 
delay. The then Deputy Defense Minister A. Pauzuolis was 
authorized by Minister A. Butkevicius himself to sign the 
agreement. However, when employees of the State Inspection 
Department began to analyze the conditions for concluding and 
implementing this agreement, the KAM leaders refused strictly to 
provide copies of the documents. By the way, as it turned out 
later, the agreement with "Selma" had been concluded without 
permission from the Lithuanian Government. A relevant 
government resolution appeared only on 1 July of last year. 
  However, under the 11 May agreement, the KAM did not receive 
a single ship, as it is. Therefore, a new government resolution 
(24 September) was adopted which served as the basis for signing 
another agreement between the KAM and "Selma." True, the latter 
bears no concrete date, only the year 1992. It provides for the 
acquisition of one war ship at a price of 120 million rubles 
[R]. Although the 24 September resolution did not permit paying 
cash, R60 million were taken from the Vilnius branch of the 
Lithuanian Bank and handed to V. Laurinavicius the next day. 
The money was paid to the "Selma" president without the 
minister's signature, because the KAM allegedly owed him this 
money according to the former unfulfilled 11 May agreement. A 
week later on 6 October, following the government resolution, 
the KAM leaders took 117 million talonai [provisional currency 
before the litas] from the Lithuanian Bank and gave it to V. 
Laurinavicius. The money for one war ship. The KAM had no 
agreement with the association "Selma" for this purpose. It had 
only Minister A. Butkevicius' resolution (without a date and a 
number) on additional payment for one war ship. 
  At the same time, the National Defense Ministry [KAM] 
launched another agreement with "Selma" (indicating only the 
year 1992) on the acquisition of a second frigate for 240 
million talonai designed to combat submarines. Despite all 
Lithuanian laws, this agreement allowed that the "Selma" 
president be paid in cash. Another 240 million talonai were 
taken from the bank and handed over to V. Laurinavicius on 17 
November. 
  Thus, V. Laurinavicius received 417 million rubles [R] for 
two ships in cash. The statement of transfer of two small 
ships, built in 1980 and 1981, was signed by R. Baltuska, 
commander of the coast guard unit, and Baltic Fleet Deputy 
Commander N. Kachanovich. On 21 October 1992, this statement 
was confirmed by Baltic Fleet Commander Y. Yegorov and Minister 
A. Butkevicius. However, none of the documents indicated the 
actual price of the ships. Maybe, this is why officers often 
hold their heads when hearing the sum that the government paid 
for the two ships. One could buy newer and much better ships 
for the millions that went to "Selma." When the State 
Inspection Department tried to retrieve the documents from the 
KAM confirming the prices of the acquired ships, the ministry 
refused to provide them. As it turned out, the KAM was 
overzealous -- it paid to "Selma" 78.8 million litai more than 
it had in Finance Ministry allotments. 
<H5>  "Selma" Takes Care of Arms </H5>
  A government resolution of 19 August 1992 authorized Defense 
Minister A. Butkevicius to conclude an agreement with the 
"Selma" association, so that the latter assisted in supplying 
the KAM with light firearms. According to the plan, "Selma" had 
to provide 5,000 AKM-74 machine guns for R198,770,000. This 
government document served as a basis for the agreement between 
the KAM and "Selma." The agreement (bearing only the year 1992) 
was signed by "Selma" Managing Director V. Laurinavicius and 
Minister A. Butkevicius. Although without a date, the document 
has a stamp. Under this agreement, "Selma" had to supply 5,000 
AKM-74 machine guns. The KAM had to pay $220 for each of them 
at an exchange rate of $1 to R180.70. For some reason the 
minister again promised to pay this sum in cash, although 
Lithuanian law forbids this. 
  Judging from the documents that RESPUBLIKA possesses today, 
between 20 August and 7 September 1992, KAM officials took out 
R198,770,000 from the ministry's account in the Vilnius branch 
of the Lithuanian Bank. All the money was handed over to 
"Selma" President V. Laurinavicius. 
  V. Drupas, chief of the KAM Armament Department, received 
the 
machine guns from "Selma" on 15 August 1992. True, "Selma" 
supplied AK-74 machine guns instead of the AKM-74 indicated in 
the government resolution and the agreement. The arms were 
transferred without a ministry's commission. The bills of 
lading were issued the same day. However, there is not a single 
word about the price of these arms and the total sum paid for 
them. How much did the ministry actually pay for these 
machine-guns? (To be continued).

  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  Prosecutors Are Estimating State Losses </H5>
  Last spring, not only the employees of the State Inspection 
Department, but also the police and the Prosecutor's Office 
became interested in the Kaunas association "Selma" and its 
formerly convicted president Vladas Laurinavicius. The latter 
took care not only of the arming of Lithuanian soldiers but also 
of the welfare of Russian servicemen in Kaliningrad Oblast 
[reference to the construction of military housing]. [passage 
omitted] 
  Having received 615.77 million rubles [R] in cash from the 
National Defense Ministry, the "Selma" association deposited 
only R41.054 million into its current bank account. The 
remaining cash, as the inspectors from the State Inspection 
Department have established, were used for other purposes. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Minister Will Not Tolerate Illegal Actions </H5>
  Current Lithuanian Defense Minister L. Linkevicius maintains 
that he has known "Selma" president V. Laurinavicius since the 
time he belonged to the Seimas [parliament] Foreign Affairs 
Committee. The active and business-like person from Kaunas made 
a good impression not only on L. Linkevicius. It was clear from 
conversations with V. Laurinavicius that he had good contacts 
not only with Kaliningrad, but also with Russia's ruling 
circles. Minister L. Linkevicius cannot account for the 
activities of the former Defense Ministry leadership, its 
decisions, and the mysterious links with the criminal world. 
The minister did not know, however, that V. Laurinavicius had 
been convicted. "We must make clear today which actions were 
legal and which were illegal. However, we must assess this from 
the viewpoint of benefit to the state. No illegal actions will 
be tolerated in the future," promised Minister L. Linkevicius.

  [Excerpts] 
<H3>  What Links "Celebrities" of Kaunas Mafia 
With Former and Current National Defense Ministry Leadership </H3>
  Last Tuesday [21 December], the Russian daily KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA reported that in early summer, the KGB division in 
Smolensk prevented an operation whereby 10 military helicopters 
MI-8MTB-1 had to be transferred to Lithuania through the Russian 
air company "Vityaz" and the Kaunas association "Selma." The 
newspaper claimed that the first two helicopters had to fly from 
Yaroslavl to Kaunas, where their "duplicates" with the same 
numbers were waiting. The latter would have flown to 
Kaliningrad in order to return later to Lithuania legally. The 
helicopters from Yaroslavl would have remained in Lithuania. 
According to the newspaper, the operation failed in the first 
stage, when its executors landed at the Vitebsk military airport 
for refueling. This big shady deal, as the Moscow newspaper 
reported, is linked with the Baltic Fleet leadership and other 
officials. 
  V. Kravchenko, acting Russian Baltic Fleet commander, told a 
BNS correspondent that the results of the investigation proved 
that no one from the Baltic Fleet leadership or the fleet's air 
force command had any link with this deal. The fleet does not 
have any agreements with the Russian air company "Vityaz." In 
addition, Vice Admiral V. Kravchenko confirmed to BNS that the 
Baltic Fleet collaborates closely with the Kaunas association 
"Selma" which is building military housing in Kaliningrad 
Oblast. As V. Kravchenko stressed, however, "cooperation is 
conducted according to the program drafted by the Russian 
government." [passage omitted] 
  The National Defense Ministry [KAM] bought two frigates from 
the Baltic Fleet through "Selma." V. Laurinavicius [the firm's 
president] received 417 million rubles [R] in cash for them. 
While law enforcement officials are investigating the 
circumstances of the origin of these and other contracts between 
KAM and "Selma," RESPUBLIKA is conducting its own investigation 
into this scandal. 
  The ships which the KAM leadership chose (or which the 
Baltic 
Fleet leadership offered for sale) were assessed for the first 
time in July of last year in Liepaja. A preliminary agreement 
was reached with the Baltic Fleet command on the purchase of two 
torpedo boats, one hydrographic ship, and one vessel of another 
sort. Last summer, the meeting in Liepaja was attended by KAM 
commanders Lieutenants E. Miliauskas, V. Mockus, and R. 
Baltuska. An agreement was reached with the Baltic Fleet 
leadership and stated in a special document that one frigate 
will cost Lithuania R94 million. This price seemed acceptable 
to the Lithuanian Fleet commanders, because prices for used 
ships on the world market are higher. They felt happy that they 
had found a common language with the Baltic Fleet command. 
Shortly after this, about two weeks later, Lieutenant E. 
Miliauskas was called to the office of Commander E. Nazelskis, 
first deputy national defense minister. Arriving there, E. 
Miliauskas also found "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius. E. 
Nazelskis, who had previously received the document concluded in 
Liepaja with the prices of the ships, ordered E. Miliauskas to 
rewrite the first page bearing the prices. "I did this because 
I could not ignore my chief's order," said E. Miliauskas to 
RESPUBLIKA recalling those days. The KAM leaders began to 
persuade their subordinates immediately that inflation forced 
them to review the prices of ships. The subordinates found out 
later that the ministry was already paying R240 million instead 
of R94 million to "Selma." How? What does "Selma" have to do 
with this? There were no mediators in the Liepaja talks. An 
agreement on the sale of ships was reached. Was a mediator 
necessary to "launder" millions from the state's pocket? 
  On 21 October 1992, while Baltic Fleet Commander Y. Yegorov 
and Minister A. Butkevicius were confirming the statement of 
transfer of the ships to Lithuania, a meeting was held in 
Kaliningrad, which was attended by R. Baltuska, commander of the 
coast guard unit, and the aforementioned V. Mockus and E. 
Miliauskas. They discussed with the Baltic Fleet leadership 
that the ships be sailed to the wharf in Klaipeda in 10 days. 
Apart from the three KAM officials, the talks were also 
attended by "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius and his 
companions. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday, we tried to talk to Mr. E. Nazelskis whom Prime 
Minister A. Slezevicius is sending for training to the Czech 
Republic. Sensing the topic of our conversation, E. Nazelskis 
categorically refused to speak with us. 
  Who armed Lithuania's national defense and how? Why Minister 
A. Butkevicius, who comes from Kaunas, chose "Selma" and its 
convicted president as a partner in buying arms, ships, and 
helicopters? What links Commander E. Nazelskis with the leaders 
of the Kaunas Mafia?...

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Udaltsov, a senior Russian diplomat in 
charge of relations with the Baltics, told Interfax that the 
talks Russian Deputy Foreign Ministers Boris Pastukhov and 
Sergey Krylov held Tuesday with their Lithuanian counterpart 
Albinas Januska were regarded as useful in the Russian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  Udaltsov said that the talks covered the foreign property of 
Lithuania and Russia following the disintegration of the USSR 
and issues in the functioning of the Russian embassy in Vilnius 
and the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow. 
  He emphasized that it was the first time the two sides had 
discused "this delicate matter. ...One could not expect to have 
all the property issues settled in one day. What is important 
is that we have come to an understanding of the way these issues 
should be discussed." 
  The diplomat expressed the hope that in further talks, to be 
held in Vilnius shortly, the two sides will agree on the 
Lithuanian embassy buildings in Rome and Paris that had been 
taken over by the USSR in 1940. The Lithuanians want them back. 
  Another senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, who also 
handles Baltic issues, thinks that the outlook for solution of 
the "property issue" is "dim." 
  He told Interfax that there was no solution in sight for the 
problem of the Russian embassy in Vilnius. "We would like to 
purchase good premises using the cash Lithuania owes for 
supplies of natural gas but the Lithuanian authorities remain 
ambiguous on that," he said. 
  The diplomat also said that the Lithuanian ownership rights 
of numerous buildings in Moscow "are in serious doubt." In his 
words, Lithuanian diplomats have no documents confirming their 
rights to use premises they now hold. 
  He said that Russia owned the former Lithuanian embassy 
building in Rome "quite legally" while the situation in Paris 
was "more complicated and should become the subject of bilateral 
talks, especially because French authorities refused to act as 
arbiters."

<F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 408] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 5 -- The right-wing opposition leader 
Vytautas Landsbergis made a statement concerning the official 
request for the membership in NATO: 
  "I hope that the West will notice the letter and request by 
Lithuanian president and Lithuania will stand next to Poland not 
only in the map, but in the list of candidates for NATO as well. 
Nobody can protest against that. We are striving for stability 
and security and this causes neither danger nor humiliation for 
anybody. 
  I also see that Lithuania's wish to become a member of NATO 
and its request do not contradict the agreement on Partnership 
For Peace. But the agreement on partnership will not serve as a 
substitute for conditions which should be fulfilled by Lithuania 
in order to become a member of NATO. This complies with the 
agreement on European security initiated by France and 
maintained by European Union. 
  It is very important that the process of peace and European 
consolidation in the Baltic region should not be disturbed by 
any non-democratic imperialistic forces".

  [Text] The oil problem has been solved, the minister of 
power engineering maintains. The Baltic News Service reported 
that Minister of Power Engineering Algimantas Stasiukynas denied 
reports published by the press that the price for oil in the 
republic is artificially inflated. 
  The figures which he presented to the journalists today show 
that the petrol price is approximately the same as in Estonia, 
however, it is significantly cheaper than in Latvia or Belarus. 
Heating, fuel oil, and electric power are cheaper than in 
neighboring countries. 
  According to Algimantas Stasiukynas, there are no problems 
at 
the moment in getting fuel supplies. The problems appeared in 
November when Russia and other CIS countries were feverishly 
accumulating supplies for the winter, however, even then 
Lithuania did not buy fuel [as heard]. At the moment the 
reserve of fuel oil is 260,000 tons. If the present weather 
remains unchanged then this amount of fuel oil would be enough 
for approximately 50 days. 
  The minister said that since the Russian oil companies 
became 
commercial, purchasing oil products has been no problem. Last 
year, because of the difficult financial situation, only 50,000 
tons of its own oil were refined by the Mazeikiai oil refinery 
Nafta; meanwhile 500,000 tons per month are needed by the 
enterprise to work at full capacity. Although it would cost $40 
million, according to the minister we should look for 
possibilities for the enterprise to process its own oil. The 
products from its own oil would cost approximately 10 to 15 
percent more, therefore, it is necessary to discuss how these 
products could become competitive with imported products. 
  The minister maintained that Lithuania has already received 
a 
proposal from the Russian oil companies to refine 20 million 
tons of oil, however, the oil from the Lukoil company has been 
delayed because export papers were not prepared in time. 
  Getting supplies of gas is a serious problem indeed. The 
minister said if an extreme situation emerges Lithuania could be 
left without gas supplies, because so far there is no 
alternative means of supplying gas. 
  The minister of power engineering stressed that in order to 
ease the problem of fuel supply Lithuania needs an oil terminal. 
This would allow the country to import cheaper oil, cause 
Russian oil companies to reduce the oil price, facilitate the 
export of fuel oil produced in Mazeikiai, and import cheaper oil 
products into Lithuania. He denied allegations that 
preparations for the construction of the oil terminal are being 
dragged out. On 15 January the results of the competition will 
be known and the foreign firms which took part in the 
competition will present their conclusions concerning the 
construction of the oil terminal in Liepaja. 
  According to the minister of power engineering there are 
many 
technical problems in Liepaja; however, international 
organizations would support Lithuania's decision to build the 
terminal there because the tendencies of Baltic integration are 
especially welcomed. In any case the construction of the oil 
terminal will start this spring, the minister of power 
engineering maintained.

<F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 408] </F>
  [Text] Kaunas, Jan 5 -- The Lithuanian Farmers' Union 
adopted a resolution to start a strike on February 10. The 
union threatened to go on strike several times last year, but 
every time a compromise was reached after the negotiations with 
the government. The main demand presented by the organizers of 
the strike is to increase produce purchase prices, to solve the 
problems of settlements with processing enterprises and their 
monopoly. 
  Professor Jonas Ciulevicius, chairman of the union, said 
that 
a quarter of 4,000 agricultural companies should go bankrupt 
this year because of the high purchase prices. 
  "The preparation for the strike have brought some positive 
results. Some milk processing enterprises pay the prices we 
required, however, this is not the achievment of the government. 
We will try to influence the government through the milk 
processing industry in order the demands of farmers to be 
fulfilled", Ciulevicius said. 
  The questions of supplying hospitals and kindergartens with 
milk and its products during the days of the strike were 
discussed at the meeting of the union.

  [Text] Estonia will not express in the near future an 
official wish to become a NATO member, the head of the first 
bureau of the Foreign Ministry, (Raimo Reinart), asserted to the 
BNS [BALTIC NEWS SERVICE]. In the words of the foreign ministry 
representative, all three Baltic States have already expressed 
their wish to become integrated in the security structures of 
Europe, among them NATO. In what forms one or another state 
expresses its plans is no longer that important, considered 
(Reinart) in the interview given to the BNS. He said that the 
question of Lithuania will not be discussed in Brussels 
separately, but in the joint context of central and eastern 
European states. (Reinart) emphasized that joining NATO was a 
lengthy process, in the course of which armaments, control of 
troops and many other questions would have to be generalized. 
This was enabled by the Partnership for Peace program offered 
by the United States of America, which, in the words of 
(Reinart), was supported by all three Baltic states.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 05, BNS - Russia will probably start 
the removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski in March or April, 
Environment Minister Andres Tarand told BNS. The process will 
take about four months, he said. 
  Tarand's statement was based on Foreign Ministry Adviser 
Mark 
Sinisoo's claim that Russia proposed June 30 as the deadline for 
taking out the fuel. 
  The minister told BNS this is "a case typical of the 
situation in Estonia where a department does not coordinate its 
activity with others." 
  In Tarand's opinion, the Transportation and Communications 
Ministry and the Rescue Service should certainly take part in 
the dismantling of the reactors. 
  Kalev Timberg, the deputy director of the Rescue Service, 
told BNS the service is to secure fire safety during the process 
and deactivation of radioactive substances if an accident 
occurs. Russia hasn't yet submitted to the Rescue Service the 
dismantling blueprints, which complicates the situation, he said. 
  Timberg refused to comment reports that Russian military 
authorities want the Rescue Service to bring to the scene 
equipment able to shoot jets of water to a height of at least 12 
meters. 
  Henno Putnik, the chief specialist of the Estonian 
Meteorology and Hydrology Institute's radiation laboratory, told 
BNS removal of nuclear fuel rods from reactors "is an operation 
Russian submariners often carry out." 
  The dismantling of the entire nuclear reactor complex in 
Paldiski is to take place in the second stage of the operation. 
  Tarand told BNS Finnish and Swedish specialists have offered 
to help Estonia in this.

  [Text] According to a report in the local press, four 
ministers are going to be replaced in the Estonian Government. 
Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste is to be replaced by the 
current defense minister, Juri Luik. Trivimi Velliste himself 
will be sent to the United Nations as Estonia's permanent 
representative. The post of defense minister is to be ceded to 
parliament member Indrek Kannik. Finance Minister Madis Uurike 
is to be replaced by Kheyki Kranikh, a member of the liberal 
faction in the State Assembly, while Economics Minister Toomas 
Sildmae will give way to Toyvo Yurgenson, a deputy of the State 
Assembly. T. Sildmae's dismissal, however, has been opposed by 
representatives of Estonian entrepreneurial circles. Coming 
together for a hasty meeting on 3 January, they sent a joint 
letter of protest to the republic's president and prime 
minister. All the supposed candidates for ministerial posts are 
members of the ruling coalition in the State Assembly. A final 
decision is expected to be made before the first parliament 
session this year, scheduled for 10 January.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan -- The president of the Russian 
Federation has signed an edict endorsing the Statute on the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) [Federalnaya Sluzhba 
Kontrrazvedki], which defines the tasks and structure of the 
service. The FCS public relations center announced this today. 
  The functions of the counterintelligence and antiterrorist 
units are defined and the powers of the FCS have been kept as 
far apart as possible from those of the law enforcement bodies. 
An FCS which performs functions outside their specialized 
service is ruled out. The total staff of the FCS will be 46 
percent less than that of the former Ministry of Security. 
  The statute envisions that the FCS will be directly 
subordinate to the president of the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Kudakayev report under the "Security" rubric: </F>
"Russian Chekists Reorganize Themselves After Western Style"] 
  [Text] All in all, two weeks have been allotted for the 
drafting of a corresponding statute in line with the edict 
scrapping the Security Ministry and creating a Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS] (the new name of the Russian 
secret service). 
  It has come to light from sources close to presidential 
quarters that work on a regulatory document for the Russian 
special service has been completed. It was signed by Boris 
Yeltsin yesterday. In accordance with it, the FCS comprises the 
very same structure of the former Security Ministry minus the 
Investigation Directorate and the so-called 15th Directorate (in 
charge of underground towns). Stripping the FCS of investigative 
functions makes it look more like a civilized country's special 
service. Earlier, a separate presidential edict made border 
troops an independent organization. 
  In all likelihood, the 15th Directorate will be handed over 
to the Main Security Directorate -- Mikhail Barsukov's agency. 
This, however, will only legally formalize what is already 
solid reality. The fate of the Investigation Directorate is 
still unclear. There is a possibility of some reorganization of 
the former Security Ministry's inner structure, but it will not 
be of a fundamental nature. 
  Former Security Ministry personnel are awaiting a repeat 
efficiency rating procedure which, however, no one fears. To 
date there are only two men on the payroll of the new 
organization -- its director Nikolay Golushko and his first 
deputy Sergey Stepashin.

decree on a cabinet reform. The draft was submitted to the 
president at the end of last year. Yeltsin discussed its 
details with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and several other

  The sources say the president had questioned several key 
provisions of the draft. 
  The sources believe the resignation of Vice-Premiers 
Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey Shakhray is a decided issue. They 
also feel Vice-Premiers Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha are 
going to be dropped from the cabinet too. As for Anatoliy 
Chubays, it is not clear whether he is going to leave the 
government altogether or remain the head of the State Property 
Committee without being a vice-premier.

  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
appointed Yuriy Baturin as his national security aide, the press 
service of the Russian leader reported on Thursday [6 January]. 
  Commenting on his appointment, Baturin told TASS that he 
would now act as a "link between the president, the federal 
counterintelligence service and the foreign intelligence service 
and would solve those issues which do not demand immediate 
control from the president". 
  This first appointment in the presidential administration 
this year can be characterised as a good sign. By appointing 
the doctor of law as the presidential national security aide, 
Yeltsin confirmed his intention announced late last year to rely 
on professionals while reforming his administration. 
  The 44-year old Baturin proved to be a professional during 
nearly one year of work as the presidential legal adviser. Most 
of legislative decrees of the president were drafted with his 
participation. 
  Besides, Baturin has often surprised reporters by his 
independent outlook. An author of the law on the press he has 
recently criticised the government position on state control 
over the media. 
  Baturin, who has an education of a journalist, also 
graduated 
from the Moscow Physical-Technical Institute and the Insitute of 
Law. His first scientific work which gave him the degree of 
master of sciences was devoted to Europarliament, the second one 
which made him doctor of sciences dwelled on the problems of 
computer legislation. 
  Baturin began his political career in the administration of 
former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Many of his 
colleagues quit state work after Gorbachev resigned, but Baturin 
was called up to work in Yeltsin's administration. 
  In contrast to many of his colleagues in the Kremlin, 
Baturin 
did not participate in the recent election campaign saying that 
"if a state official gives priority to political activity, then 
his direct work moves to the background".

that Yuriy Skokov, Viktor Yerin, and Viktor Ilyushin already 
held a meeting the other day. According to the source, these 
consultations may precipitate significant reshuffles at the 
Internal Affairs Ministry in the near future. In particular, 
Viktor Yerin's first deputy, Mikhail Yegorov, who is also chief 
of the Internal Affairs Ministry's Main Administration for the 
Struggle Against Organized Crime, may be appointed internal 
affairs minister.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The long-awaited government 
reshuffling which was expected to be announced on Thursday is, 
most evidently, postponed for at least another five days. 
  Two weeks ago it was announced that Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin had to draft the reshuffling scheme by January 6, 
however, TASS learned from reliable sources that on Wednesday 
the president returned the draft back to the prime minister for 
"improvement". Nobody in the entourage of the president and the 
prime minister agrees to elaborate. 
  However, several officials close to Chernomyrdin hinted that 
there would be no major restructuring of the government. The 
number of ministries and department will be reduced 
inconsiderably, some of them would simply merge. 
  Although head of the government administration Vladimir 
Kvasov confirmed that the government staff will be reduced by 20 
per cent, it is still a secret how the nine deputy prime 
ministers will be reshuffled. 
  It remains to guess the future composition of the government 
according to who of its members had already moved to their new 
offices in the former parliament building. 
  As for today it is known for sure that the prime minister, 
as 
well as two of his first deputies -- Oleg Soskovets and Yegor 
Gaydar -- have already resettled. 
  It is impossible to find out who else has moved to the new 
premises. The entourage of the prime minister recommends to 
wait for a corresponding presidential decree which will make it 
all clear. 
  However, it is rumoured in the government circles that the 
prime minister would have two first deputies and two deputies. 
The latter may be Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha who are 
currently responsible for the social and agrarian policies. 
  However, a government member who asked not to be named told 
TASS that the exact number of deputy prime ministers would 
depend on whether four of the current deputies would succeed in 
getting leading positions in the new legislature. The four 
include Vladimir Shumeyko, Sergey Shakhray, Aleksandr Shokhin 
and Boris Fedorov. 
  Anatoliy Chubays will most evidently remain head of the 
property managing committee, but will be stripped of the post of 
deputy premier, according to the source. 
  It is quite probable that Shumeyko and Shakhray will get 
leading positions in parliament, but the prospect is dubious for 
Shokhin and Fedorov. 
  Shokhin, the chief Russian foreign debt negotiator, boasts 
support of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and if he ends 
even as the foreign trade minister this would be a sensation 
proving that there is a tough struggle in the Russian 
establishment. 
  Fedorov, who is also the finance minister, had stated before 
parliamentary elections, that he would resign if his arch rival 
Viktor Gerashchenko, the chief banker, keeps his post. However, 
Chernomyrdin would hardly agree to sack Gerashchenko. 
  In the final analysis, it is clear that the exact government 
reshuffling scheme has not been yet determined either by 
Chernomyrdin or by Yeltsin. It remains to wait until the new 
parliament opens its first session on January 11 and whether the 
deputy premiers succeed to get the positions they want there.

inside opposition? This is the problem," member of the 
Presidential Council Georgiy Satarov told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  He claims that the present state apparatus is inefficient. 
Any transition of power from elected politicians to a 
bureaucratic apparatus engenders an urge to uphold corporative 
interests, not the interests of the electorate. This leads to 
the formation of an "army of state bureaucrats" in Russia. 
  "The obviously low level of professionalism is another 
drawback of Russian bureaucracy," Satarov believes. This is why 
politicians of the "latest call-up" have "raised much fuss and 
have provoked political squabbles in the upper echelons of 
power, turning apparatus offices into party headquarters". This 
resulted in the apparatus's deep politisation which leaves it 
very little time for real work. 
  Consequently, the bureaucrats have abused the powers given 
them by the apparatus to satisfy personal political ambitions. 
The Russian people could witness this before the latest 
parliamentary elections. 
  Satarov noted that "Boris Yeltsin has realised the existence 
of this problem, and this is confirmed by his intention to 
revamp his own administration and the government by cutting the 
number of officials". Moreover, the president told a press 
conference on December 22 that it was necessary to pursue a 
publicly open policy, to promote a permanent dialogue between 
the authorities and the society." 
  Satarov believes that both these things are most important, 
as well as the personnel policy's orientation on 
professionalism, which could "reduce the share of politicised 
bureaucrats and their destructive influence".

<F P=106> [Tamara Zamyatina report in the "Nuances" column: "Filatov </F>
and Ilyushin Vie for Influence in the Kremlin in a Bid To Reform 
the Presidential Administration in Their Style"] 
  [Text] As it transpired on 12 December, the presidential 
administration machine -- three analytical centers under the 
president, the State Legal Directorate, the Directorate for 
Liaison with the Territories, the Presidential Council, and a 
host of aides and advisers -- failed either to analyze the 
voters' mood in the run-up to the elections, to predict the 
outcome of the campaign, or more or less coherently and promptly 
to sum up the results of the voting. 
  The skidding of the "analytical machine" became so obvious 
that two parallel projects for reforming the presidential 
apparatus were born in the Kremlin simultaneously. 
  One is being developed by deputy administration chief Sergey 
Krasavchenko. Its essence, according to Sergey Filatov, 
consists in that the three analytical centers under the 
president, headed by Nikolay Malyshev, Anatoliy Rakitov and Petr 
Filippov, will be reorganized as a single expert-analytical 
center. This center or expert council should concentrate all 
analytical information coming in from various research 
structures and work out recommendations for the president, the 
government, and leaders of the Russian regions. Each expert will 
be responsible for a particular area of activity and have a 
corresponding working group assigned to him. 
  In spite of its obvious symmetry, this system does not root 
out the isolation of the presidential administrative structures: 
Along with the expert-analytical council, the corps of advisers 
and various directorates under the president will remain. 
Duplication is inevitable. 
  The other plan for reforming the administration is being 
devised by independent experts from among the Presidential 
Council members. It rules out the horizontal subdivision of 
structures within the administration. This is a classic 
hierarchic scheme whereby the head of the "pyramid" will have 
several deputies with the rank of presidential aides. In their 
turn the deputies will have mid-level analyst personnel 
subordinated to them while the latter will rely on working 
groups supplying "raw material" and providing preliminary 
information analysis. 
  In fact, however, competition is unfolding not so much 
between two concepts as between two figures. Journalists who 
are at home in the Kremlin corridors of power know very well 
that there are two competing camps in the presidential 
apparatus. These are the administration headed by Sergey 
Filatov, and a staff of experts/analysts headed by Viktor 
Ilyushin, the president's closest aide and chief of his personal 
office, and who was also Boris Yeltsin's associate in Sverdlov 
party structures. Viktor Ilyushin is apparently the most 
"tight-lipped" [zastegnutyy] man in the presidential apparatus, 
and the most influential. 
  Mr. Ilyushin tends to favor the second scheme, whose essence 
lies in building a single "pyramid" of the presidential 
apparatus with himself sitting at its top. 
  Strictly speaking, neither Mr. Ilyushin nor Mr. Filatov are 
analysts. They substantially differ in the extent of openness 
in politics -- openness, the need for which was highlighted by 
President Yeltsin at his post-election press conference. Viktor 
Ilyushin has perfect command of the apparatus situation but, as 
journalists already know, with his style of work the 
"presidential court" will be fenced off by a solid wall of 
silence and secrecy. 
  Sergey Filatov's rejection of a deputy's chair in the State 
Duma rather signifies his intention to head the drive to reform 
the administration. According to some reports, reorganization 
will apparently follow the scheme proposed by him. Boris 
Yeltsin, too, will hardly decline his good offices and 
charismatic image.

  [Text] Information that an explosive device has been 
planted in the White House, where the Russian Government is to 
have its premises and where Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and some 
of his deputies have already moved in, and that an explosion 
there was imminent turned out to be false, INTERFAX has learned 
from (Litvinov), duty officer at Moscow's Main Internal Affairs 
Directorate. 
  At the same time, he said, operational measures to find the 
person who made the anonymous telephone call concerning the 
imminent explosion are continuing. Such anonymous calls can be 
regarded as malicious hooliganism and can entail imprisonment 
between one and five years in accordance with the criminal code. 
The spokesman said that the caller, who telephoned at around 
1730 on Tuesday, was a woman.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer Aleksandr Panov] The SCSE [State 
Committee for the State of Emergency] trial resumed and was 
again adjourned until 10 January in Moscow. Our correspondent 
reports sensational, as he put it, details of today's sitting. 
  [Correspondent Aleksandr Ukhov] The lawyers of defendants 
[Anatoliy] Lukyanov and [Vasiliy] Starodubtsev proposed that 
criminal proceedings against their clients be dropped in 
connection with the fact that Lukyanov and Starodubtsev had been 
elected to Russia's highest legislative body. At the request of 
defendant Lukyanov, lawyer Padva read out a letter from Boris 
Yeltsin which the Russian president had sent Lukyanov on 30 
December. The letter said, inter alia: 
  [Padva reading letter] I congratulate you on the holiday 
(and 
wish) that we establish fruitful and constructive joint work 
sharing responsibility for the future of Russia and its 
citizens. I am asking you to submit your proposals regarding 
forms of interaction between parliamentarians and the president 
and mechanisms for resolving possible contradictions between us.

  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The press service of the 
Russian leader denied on Thursday press reports claiming that 
the Russian president had sent a personal message to former 
Soviet parliament speaker Anatoliy Lukyanov congratulating him 
on being elected to the new Russian parliament. 
  "This does not correspond to reality", the press service 
said 
and blamed the lawyer of Lukyanov, who is standing trial for 
organising the 1991 abortive Soviet coup, for misinformation. 
  The press service said that the president had sent a message 
of greetings to all the lawmakers elected to the new parliament 
in which he expressed hope for joint constructive work. 
  However, the lawyer of Lukyanov presented the message, while 
speaking in court, in such a way as if it had been sent 
personally to Lukyanov. 
  "Unfortunately, reporters failed to realise this `nuance' 
which exposes defects in professional ethics of the lawyer", the 
press service said.

  [Text] Moscow January 5 (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin has decided to take additional steps to guarantee 
the right of Russian citizens to information. This is reflected 
in his "Decree on the Citizens' Right to Information", received 
by ITAR- TASS on Wednesday [5 January]. 
  The president instructed the commission for legislative 
proposals to prepare a bill "On the Right to Information", which 
would be presented to the new parliament as a top priority 
legislative initiative. 
  Until the adoption of such a law, the decree establishes the 
duty of all government bodies, organisations, enterprises, 
public associations, and responsible officials to ensure freedom 
of information. In particular, the access to information which 
is of public or personal interest to Russian citizens is 
guaranteed. 
  The decree stipulates that the essence of decisions taken by 
government bodies is to be explained more in-depth on radio and 
television programmes. The state television companies have been 
ordered to prepare a series of programmes which will explain the 
activities of federal bodies. 
  One of the decree's points particularly declares that the 
work of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of 
power are to be given equal air time.

  [Text] Boris Yeltsin has decided to take additional steps 
to guarantee the right of citizens to information. This is 
served by the edict "On Additional Guarantees of the Right of 
Citizens to Information," which ITAR-TASS received yesterday. 
  The president has entrusted the Legislative Proposals 
Commission with preparing a draft law "On the Right to 
Information," which will be submitted to parliament as a 
priority legislative initiative. Pending the adoption of such a 
law, the edict establishes the responsibilities of state organs, 
organizations and enterprises, public associations, and 
officials in ensuring information openness. In particular, it 
guarantees the accessibility of information which is of public 
interest or affects citizens' personal interests. 
  The essence of state organs' decisions will be explained 
more 
extensively on radio and television. 
  One of the points in the edict particularly stipulates that 
the activities of federal organs of legislative, executive, and 
judicial power are given equal coverage in programs. 
  By means of another edict Boris Yeltsin has decided to form 
the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes under the Russian 
Federation president on the basis of the Information Arbitration 
Court which operated during the period of preparation for the 
parliamentary elections. 
  The edict, which ITAR-TASS also received yesterday, states 
that the main functions of the Judicial Chamber are to assist 
the president in defending rights and freedoms in the mass 
information sphere; to ensure the objective and reliable nature 
of reports; to ensure the principle of equality of rights in the 
mass information sphere; to ensure protection of the moral 
interests of children and young people in the mass media; to 
ensure pluralism in news and sociopolitical television and radio 
programs; and a number of other tasks. 
  Anatoliy Vengerov has been appointed chairman of the 
Judicial 
Chamber for Information Disputes.

  [Text] Moscow January 5 ITAR-TASS--Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin issued a decree on the formation of the permanent 
Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes, to work under the 
president. The chamber's chairman, Anatoliy Vengerov, granted 
ITAR-TASS an interview in which he said the new chamber was 
designed to reinforce the information rights guaranteed in 
article 29 of the Russian constitution, and assist the president 
in protecting the freedom of the press. 
  Vengerov was the chairman of the Information Court of 
Arbitration, which was formed to handle disputes arising from 
the recent electoral campaign and gave rise to the new chamber. 
He is sure that his experience in that post can become the 
basis for the judicial chamber's work. The new chamber, just 
like its "predecessor," will not be included in the federal 
court system and will use moral and legal methods to carry out 
its resolutions. 
  The main task of the judicial chamber is to assist the 
president in implementing the constitutional guarantees of 
rights and freedoms. Besides that, the chamber will deal with 
the truthfulness and objectivity of information and ensure that 
the principle of pluralism is followed. 
  The chamber will have wide powers concerning disputes over 
the amount of radio and TV coverage given to the parliamentary 
factions in the Federal Assembly. A completely new aspect has 
also been attached to the chamber's functions, the defence of 
the "moral interests" of children and youth in (or perhaps from) 
the mass media. 
  In addition, the former press and information ministry's job 
of issuing warnings to mass media which break the law "On the 
Mass Media" has been transferred to the judicial chamber for 
information disputes. 
  The chamber's personnel has been appointed. It includes four 
members of the former arbitration court besides the chairman: 
Igor Yeremin (deputy chairman), Aleksandr Kopeika, Viktor 
Monakhov and Mariana Panyarskaya. Igor Ivanov, the chairman of 
the Central Electoral Commission, and Yuriy Feofanov, editor-in- 
chief of the ZAKON (Law) journal, have also become members of 
the judicial chamber.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Yermolin: "Factions in State Duma in </F>
Search of Accord"] 
  [Text] On 4 January, immediately after the new year 
holiday, the leaders of the four factions in the State Duma -- 
"Russia's Choice," the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the 
Communists, and the Agrarian Party -- held a routine meeting on 
determining who the speaker in the lower chamber and his 
deputies should be. I might hazard a guess that whatever the 
outcome of the meeting, it will for the moment be impossible to 
talk of some stable long-term compromise between the leading 
factions in the new parliament. 
  On the contrary, an enduring struggle is emerging between 
the 
newly formed parliamentary forces in the run-up to the first 
session (which, I must remind you, opens on Tuesday, 11 
January), with many instances of disagreement, and not just 
between those whose orientations run absolutely counter to one 
another. There are today no grounds for talking about any kind 
of democratic bloc. The nature of the sporadic statements made 
by Shakhray's and Yavlinskiy's camps bear witness to their 
intention primarily to do their own thing. "Russia's Choice" is 
looking very much alone at the moment. 
  Maybe the situation will change after "Russia's Choice" 
makes 
it plain that it is not claiming the role of "big brother" in 
relation to its potential less numerous allies. But for the 
moment it is easy to detect notes of hurt pride in the tone of 
Sergey Shakhray himself and his closest associate, Konstantin 
Zatulin. For example, commenting specifically on the intention 
of the four aforementioned factions to "add" their own deputy 
speakers to the speaker, Zatulin says that he sees in this a 
threat of the next in the series of presidium dictatorships. 
But Shakhray, as far as we know, absolutely avoided 
participation in a negotiation process according to the formula 
"four plus the others." 
  Strictly speaking nothing unpredictable is happening. It 
would be strange if the factions, which have just emerged from 
the furnace of the elections, suddenly began to fraternize 
according to principles of equality and nonresistance. And if 
they only took as their basis for reconciliation proposals 
prepared somewhere off in a presidential commission. No, what 
should have happened has happened -- that is, a power struggle. 
For every former Soviet person knows: However much you talk 
about the titular nature of the speaker's position, it is 
nevertheless the position of the chief. Everything comes down 
to the degree to which this chief will adhere to decorum and 
regulations, and to how much of a professional he will be. 
  The only thing which is alarming is that the faction members 
are clearly striving for relations based on seniority. The 
number of votes received at the elections, it seems, is 
beginning to fulfill the role of a distinguishing mark. 
Naturally such a table of ranks produces a corresponding mood 
in relations. 
  Nonetheless there are no grounds for absolute pessimism. I 
repeat that there is in train a normal process of, let us say, 
the sharing out of strategically advantageous seats in the State 
Duma. In such circumstances nervousness and overwrought emotions 
are unavoidable. Let us try to hope that participation in the 
lawmaking process itself will settle the "Brownian motion" of 
the political struggles within parliament and turn the 
parliamentarians' attention to Russia's and Russians' urgent 
problems.

  [Text] Party groups in the Russian State Duma have not 
reached agreement in their consultations on candidates to the 
posts of speaker and his deputies. 
  According to a well-informed source, Russia's Choice, 
Communists, Agrarians and Liberal Democrats are ready to agree 
on a speaker to represent one of the smaller groups -- 
Yavlinskiy's bloc or the Women of Russia -- on condition that 
his or her four deputies represent their four biggest groups. 
  Communists favor a strong, not decorative speaker as well as 
the formation of a leading body such as a council of the Duma. 
  According to the source, the four biggest groups are also 
discussing the formation of parliamentary committees. Russia's 
Choice is claiming leading posts in two or three (economic) 
committees, Liberal Democrats in the international affairs 
committee, Communists in defense and security committees, 
agrarians in committees on agriculture, constitutional 
legislation and legal reform. 
  A former member of the Supreme Soviet and a representative 
of 
the Agrarian Party Vladimir Isakov intends to head the latter 
committee.

  [Text] Moscow, 5 Jan -- This meeting with you -- who are of 
the land, of the people -- is very important to me, Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said today at a meeting with 
members of the Inter-Regional Association of Independent 
Deputies of the Federal Assembly's lower house. The government 
needs to know what stand independent deputies will take in the 
State Duma, he added. 
  Chernomyrdin stressed that the government would support any 
faction willing to work for the good of the country and called 
on deputies to establish firm cooperation between government and 
parliament based on a centrist position. He, in his turn, 
guaranteed to support constructive dialogue between the two 
branches of power. If necessary, I will come and meet you and 
bring the whole government with me, he said. 
  Chernomyrdin said the government would not be pursuing 
"popular" economic policies and that everything should be done 
to avoid a situation where the executive proposes "unpopular" 
and the legislative "popular" measures.

  [Text] Moscow, January 5 (TASS) -- "Deputies of the State 
Duma chairman should be elected on a parity basis: one from the 
election blocs and the other from individual constituencies," 
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray said. 
  Speaking at a meeting with the deputies of the State Duma 
from autonomous entities in Moscow on Wednesday, Shakhray said 
that "there have been attempts by large election blocs to 
predetermine the fate of the State Duma behind the back of the 
majority of deputies." He stressed that the Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord is ready for forming a broad coalition in the 
Duma "at least on the basis of a common approach towards the 
principle of election of the duma chairman." This would ensure 
the equality of all deputies. Additionally, all Duma leaders 
should be elected individually by secret ballot, Shakhray said. 
  He pointed out that a faction in the State Duma can include 
not less than 14 people which equals the number of seats each 
bloc has in the house if it has cleared the five per cent 
threshold. Shakhray added that a "faction begins to exist only 
after it has been registered by the Duma secretariat."

  [Text] The Russian government has earmarked $500 Mn for 
the construction of a new parliament complex in Moscow. This 
was reported on Wednesday [5 January] to the organizing 
commission of the new parliament by Pavel Borodin, a 
presidential spokesman. He said that by the end of January 
contracts are going to be signed with a number of foreign 
construction companies. 
  According to Borodin, construction will begin on February 1 
and end by January 1 next year. He said there was every 
guarantee that the project would be completed in 10 months. 
  The complex will consist of an administrative building with 
a 
floorspace of 360,000 square meters and a 700-room hotel. It 
will be built in place of a stadium between Krasnopresnenskaya 
metro- station and the former building of parliament.

<F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report in the "Parliament" column: "A Merry </F>
Christmas, People of Russia! The Government Has Raised $500 
Million To Build Another White House"] 
  [Text] Yesterday a deputies commission on accommodating 
the State Duma once again unanimously confirmed its previous 
decision: The building of the former Comecon is unsuitable for 
the work of the lower parliament chamber. The deputies refused 
to be convinced otherwise by Pavel Borodin, chief of the Main 
Socio-Production Directorate of the presidential administration, 
and his deputy Andrey Voykov, who were present at the commission 
session. Both of them, however, reaffirmed: The White House 
will not be ceded to the Federal Assembly. Instead Mr. Borodin 
promised an early construction of a special parliament building 
next to the former House of Soviets (presumably in the place of 
the Krasnaya Presnya stadium). At the end of January bidding is 
to be held among a number of foreign construction companies and 
as of 1 February the erection of the future compound for the 
Federal Assembly will begin, planned to be completed by 1 
January 1995. The compound includes an administrative building 
(360,000 square meters) and a hotel for the deputies (700 
suites, mostly of three and four rooms). Some $500 million is 
earmarked for this. As one of the deputies noted, precisely 
this sum is required to implement a conversion program in the 
military industrial complex. A source in the Russia's Choice 
parliamentary faction told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent 
that his impression is that everything is being done to make the 
Duma monolithic in its opposition to the executive branch, since 
Russia's Choice also favored the Duma's presence in the White 
House. The former Comecon building itself is being hectically 
prepared for the deputies' arrival. True, its present lessees 
-- for the most part commercial (and fairly well known) 
structures -- have not yet moved out. As people from the 
presidential administration have promised, this will probably 
happen by the end of the month and by 1 March the refurbishing 
of the building will be completed. At present it lacks 
telephones, service areas, furniture, and various technical 
equipment. With respect to the latter NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's 
confidential source commented tersely: It has been stolen, 
although judging by the documents, everything is in perfect 
order. 
  It can therefore be assumed that after its first session the 
Duma will have to interrupt its work for one to one and a half 
months. Incidentally, chances are that there will be no joint 
session of both chambers on 11 January since Boris Yeltsin is 
not planning to address it. On one hand, this is not provided 
for under the new constitution; on the other, he apparently does 
not want to let the deputies into the Kremlin and report 
anything to them. According to sources in the president's 
administration, there are plans for the president to address an 
assembly of deputies who will be invited to the Kremlin as a 
group of citizens. 
  Many questions are scheduled for the first session's agenda: 
the election of the Duma chairman and his deputies, the 
approval of the number of committees and their leadership, and 
the adoption of interim rules of procedure. This agenda can 
apparently be fulfilled only if consensus is reached at the 
ongoing preliminary consultations between factions. At present, 
however, it has been achieved on only one issue -- the rejection 
of the premises assigned to the Duma. The candidacy of the 
speaker has not been determined yet, and it is not even clear 
according to which principle he will be elected. Russia's 
Choice, although it continues talks on the chairman candidacy 
with the Agrarian Party of Russia, the Russian Federation 
Communist Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is 
still committed to the idea of electing him from among 
representatives of small factions. As one Russia's Choice 
deputy told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, these factions 
include primarily Yabloko and Women of Russia, and their 
candidates, Vladimir Lukin, Anatoliy Adamishin, and Alevtina 
Fedulova, although the last two figures arouse objections: the 
first within his own faction, the second from the negotiating 
partners. With respect to electing four deputy speakers on a 
party principle (this idea is a kind of compromise between large 
and small factions) with the speaker representing some 
non-influential group, Russia's Choice is fairly well disposed, 
hoping that it will manage to uphold the concept of a weak Duma 
leadership. The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, in the 
words of its chairman, is ready to swap "its" deputy for three 
committees, although in the general interfactional bargaining it 
is laying claim to the international affairs committee, whereas 
the Russian Federation Communist Party wants the defense and 
security committee, and the Agrarian Party wants the agrarian 
committee and the constitutional and judicial reform committee. 
Russia's Choice is claiming chairmanship in all financial and 
economic committees, of which there will be two or three. 
  At present, however, the communists and the agrarians have 
decided to abandon the idea of proportional formation of the 
Duma bodies and of a weak speaker, which would perpetuate the 
situation as it emerged prior to the elections where no one 
gained any advantage. They are slowly gathering a majority 
coalition and want it to receive leading posts and also to form 
a certain omnipotent Duma Council -- something like the 
presidium in the former Supreme Soviet. This was reported to 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent by a source from the 
Russia's Choice faction.

  [Text] The Deputy Chief of Staff of the Russian President 
Andrey Voykov and the Operations manager under the president 
Pavel Borodin met with members of the deputies commission of the 
Committee for organizing the State Duma activities Wednesday [5 
January]. 
  The commission, which is responsible for providing premises 
for the State Duma, is headed by the Federal Assembly's Chief of 
Staff Vladimir Podoprigora. 
  The need for the meeting arose after the commission sent to 
the president its official conclusion that the building (36 Novy 
Arbat Street) and the adjacent Mir Hotel, set aside for the 
State Duma, are unfit for normal parliamentary activities. 
  After hearing the arguments offered by the administration, 
the commission believed they were unconvincing and unanimously 
adopted its previous decision. In the summing-up document the 
commission took into consideration the assurances that the 
commercial structures, such as Mosbank, the International 
Monetary Fund and others would vacate the building of the former 
Mayor's Office by February 1. Also taken into consideration was 
the administration's promise to finish the repairs and fit the 
building by March 1. The commission said, though, that deputies 
would not have normal working conditions in the building. The 
above conclusion is to be considered today, at 19:00, at the 
meeting of the Organizing Committee headed by Sergey Filatov.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, January 5 (TASS) -- Independent deputies of 
Russia's new parliament warned on Wednesday that large election 
blocs are seeking to gain control of the State Duma. 
  A statement issued by the Inter-regional Association of 
Independent Deputies of the Lower House of the Federal Assembly 
today suggests reforming the house factions not only by the 
principle of their party orientation, but also by other 
principles. It also proposes forming ruling bodies of the house 
on a parity basis. The deputies believe that every candidate 
should be elected by secret ballot. 
  The number of deputies of the State Duma chairman should be 
determined by the following principle: one deputy from the 
election blocs and one from individual constituencies. 
  The statement stressed that the house procedural regulations 
should be based not on a party principle, but on the principle 
of multi-factionalism which takes into account the interests of 
the whole deputy corps. As for the procedural regulations they 
should not violate the constitution or contradict the voters's 
will, the deputies said. 
  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said that the 
government will support any faction which will work for the 
benefit of the country. 
  Speaking at a meeting with members of the Inter-regional 
Association of Independent Deputies of the Lower House of the 
Federal Assembly in Moscow on Wednesday, Chernomyrdin said "for 
me the meeting with you, representatives of the people, is very 
important. The government must know the position of independent 
deputies in the State Duma." 
  The prime minister called on the deputies to stick to the 
centrist position to develop close cooperation between the 
government and the parliament. He pledged support for a 
constructive dialogue between the two branches of power. "If the 
need be, I will go to you and bring the whole government along," 
he said.

  [Text] There is every likelihood that a joint session of 
the Federal Assembly's Houses, expected in the Kremlin's Marble 
Hall on January 11, will not be convened. Most likely, the 
Federation Council and Duma will hold separate sessions on that 
day. 
  A presidential administration spokesman has told INTERFAX 
that the Federation Council and State Duma Organizing 
Committees, led by Vladimir Shumeyko and Sergey Filatov, will 
submit to Yeltsin shortly their recommendations on how 
parliamentary sessions should be held. Their guidelines will 
make up the basis of an appropriate instruction. 
  Duma is due to meet in the former building of the Mayor's 
Office on New Arbat, 36, and the Federation Council -- in the 
former Russian Press House on Bolshaya Dmitrovka, 26.

<F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova report under the "Forecast" rubric: </F>
"Soviet-Style Duma -- Try It by All Means, But Will It Work?"] 
  [Text] Consultations between the four largest factions in 
the newly elected parliament are going on behind closed doors. 
It is their prerogative. The information area is already 
overloaded with rumors, proposals, and plans on the future work 
of the Federal Assembly, and particularly the State Duma. We 
are expecting sensations, we are steeling ourselves for 
scandals. Perhaps it is not a bad thing that the "machinations" 
are being concealed from society for the time being. 
Ultimately, it is not scandal we need, but constructiveness. 
  There is just one factor which prompts wariness. The essence 
of the talks, the latest round of which took place yesterday, is 
concentrated on the search for candidates for State Duma 
chairman. Why does this question concern the deputies so much? 
After all, if we proceed from the new Constitution, the figure 
of chairman is purely ceremonial: He chairs sessions, and he is 
in charge of internal order. Neither party allegiance, nor his 
attitude toward reforms, nor his stance in respect of the 
government and the president should be decisive in the make-up 
of the speaker: All that is required is an upstanding manner, 
organizational ability, and a high degree of empathy with and 
loyalty to the various points of view. Finding such a person 
among 450 deputies would not be such a difficult problem, 
provided there is agreement over the priorities. 
  But clearly, the matter is precisely one of priorities. The 
old Soviet habit is coming into play: The most important thing 
is not the law (in this case, the Basic Law) -- the most 
important thing is who is chief. If the chief is "one of yours" 
you stand a chance, but if he is "someone else's" there will be 
additional problems. Given that we all realize how difficult it 
is to break this habit, the agreement (or the readiness to 
agree) that the candidate speaker ought to be sought not amid 
the strongest "pressure groups" but in the small factions was 
very pleasing to begin with. At the very least, this is a 
guarantee that the political "hue" of the chairman will not have 
a decisive influence on the activity of the Duma. 
  But nothing of the sort. Three of the "strong" (the 
agrarians, the Communists, and the liberal-democrats) have 
already prepared a candidacy "between themselves," and everyone 
is already avidly totting up the votes they can collect. 
  The next logical step in this system is as follows: If the 
"strong" fail to install their chairman, then it will be 
necessary to secure for themselves the deputy chairman's seat at 
least. Thus there will be as many deputy chairmen as there are 
"strong" elements. And it may be that the idea springs to mind 
-- and why not? -- to install a deputy chairman from each 
faction. To keep a balance, it could be said. 
  All this is only too reminiscent of the old Supreme Soviet, 
and only too far removed from the civilized parliament toward 
which everybody is striving. Equally far removed is the idea to 
give the new parliament a newspaper. Who will undertake to 
determine the orientation of this publication, and the 
principles according to which it will act? A cursory dismissal 
greeted all talk of an information bulletin. No, it must be a 
popular newspaper, with ready-made subscribers, with all the 
attributes of a sociopolitical publication. Accordingly, this 
will constitute either a guarantee of frenzied and grueling 
brawls between the political groups across the pages of one 
publication circulated throughout the entire country, or a 
puppet publication subordinate to the chairman (or the 
presidium, if there are a lot of chiefs) wholly in the spirit of 
the old ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  Soviet power, of course, did not leave us unscathed. And it 
will continue to survive for a long time yet -- if not in form, 
then in essence. It has a serious base in the new parliament. 
It merely remains to hope that the effectiveness of this type 
of rule will prove less than high in the new conditions. You 
can pour old wine into new wineskins, but the taste will 
inevitably differ.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Vyacheslav Alekseyevich Nikonov, </F>
State Duma deputy, by Sergey Lomakin; from the "Utro" program -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Lomakin] Now we have another guest on our program 
and I think that since this is the last program for the year we 
will talk a little about forecasts. He is Vyacheslav 
Alekseyevich Nikonov, doctor of historic sciences, adviser of 
the International Reform Fund, and deputy of the new State Duma. 
I would like to congratulate you and ask you: How do you see 
the coming year? 
  [Nikonov] First of all, good morning and greetings on the 
coming new year, as well as the new political year. What will 
happen in terms of political stability? It seems to me that the 
political stars will not be too kind to Russia next year, 
although I am sure that things will not go as far as the acute 
conflicts we had in October of the past year. 
  [Lomakin] You mean this year? 
  [Nikonov] Yes, October of this year. We can see that a new 
constitutional order has been created, new representative organs 
of power have been elected, yet nevertheless the composition of 
these representative organs and the very content of the 
constitution are not something that inspires too much optimism. 
As you know, the content of the State Duma is such that 
opposition forces will predominate in it. The constitution also 
includes a whole series of hitches and careless points which 
could be used by the opposition in order to destabilize the 
situation. 
  Naturally the question arises: How fruitful will the future 
Federal Assembly be, and how effectively and quickly will it be 
able to adopt laws? I would not harbor too many illusions in 
this regard. We are, after all, entering into a completely new 
constitutional system. A fundamentally new state organ of 
legislative power is being created which must organize itself, 
and this too will require some time. A lot of time will be 
taken up by questions relating to the location of this organ. 
Obviously it will not agree with the proposals made by the 
president about putting it in the CEMA Building or the Russian 
Press House, about which there has been talk. 
  I am sure that the question of assessing various political 
events of the past year will arise. Unfortunately, the new 
constitution gives the State Duma a fairly serious opportunity 
to move a vote of no confidence in the government and to force 
it to resign. According to the new constitution, it turns out 
that if the State Duma passes a vote of no confidence in the 
government twice, consecutively, the President must either 
disband the Duma or ask the government to resign, but it 
includes a rule according to which the President cannot disband 
anything on these grounds during the first year of the Duma's 
work. So the president would have to ask the government to 
resign. 
  This would create a situation of fairly serious political 
instability, even though the president has some counter options. 
The fact is that after the resignation of one government, he can 
nominate a premier unacceptable to the Duma. He can do this 
three times, after which he can disband the Duma. So the 
constitution includes a whole series of points which will 
promote confrontation in the relations between the two branches 
of power. 
  [Lomakin] Tell me please, Vyacheslav Alekseyevich, I think 
this concerns many people: How will Zhirinovskiy act, taking 
into consideration his victory at the elections? 
  [Nikonov] First of all, I do not consider that Zhirinovskiy 
won at the elections. Obviously he made a very strong showing, 
but we know that Zhirinovskiy got his representatives only into 
that half of the lower house, the State Duma, which was elected 
according to party lists. As far as the second half of the 
State Duma -- which was elected from electoral districts -- is 
concerned, there are not too many Zhirinovskiy supporters in it, 
while in the Upper House, the Federation Council, there are 
practically none. 
  I think that Zhirinovskiy will undoubtedly play a fairly 
active role through the coming year. I imagine that his tactics 
will be to demonstrate the utmost constructivism. He will try 
to show himself to be a loyal supporter of President Yeltsin's 
course, a course of reforms. Essentially he will be telling 
people: I, together with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, will do 
everything possible to establish order in this country. 
  [Lomakin] Will this be some kind of smokescreen? 
  [Nikonov] It will be a serious smokescreen, since it is 
quite obvious that as soon as there is any whiff of the next 
elections, his tactics may change 180 degrees and he will say: 
We tried, we did everything to achieve order in the country 
together with the president, but it turns out that the president 
has insufficient strength in order to fulfill this task. 
  I attach fairly great hopes to the elections that we will 
have next year. As you know, we will have elections in all the 
subjects of the federation -- in republics, krays, and oblasts 
-- and they will be held in accordance with legislative norms 
that will be developed within the subjects of the federation 
themselves. Local elections will also be held. In essence, the 
entire system of power, from bottom to top, will take shape next 
year. Unfortunately, it was in disarray in recent times. 
  [Lomakin] Thank God, Vyacheslav Alekseyevich, that we have 
arrived at an optimistic end. There is nothing more thankless 
than making forecasts; however, we tried to do this today and 
Vyacheslav Alekseyevich Nikonov played first-chair violin in our 
orchestra today. He is one of the newly elected members of the 
State Duma, a doctor of historical sciences, and an adviser of 
the International Reform Fund. Thank you. 
  [Nikonov] Thank you and once again, a happy new year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valentin Kuptsov, first deputy chairman of </F>
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive 
Committee, by Valentina Nikifirova; place and date not given: 
"Still Too Early To Talk of an Alliance"] 
  [Text] The distribution of forces in the Federal Assembly 
is a serious question; hence journalists are endeavoring to 
forecast the various scenarios ahead of time. The creation of 
several blocs has already been announced, and for the Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation they have prepared alliances 
with "Russia's Choice" and the Liberal Democratic Party. But 
what is happening in reality? 
  [Kuptsov] It is too soon to talk about blocs and factions. 
A great deal of serious preparatory work is going on. Deputies 
are working in temporary commissions preparing for the first 
days of the sessions and agreeing working questions -- on the 
procedure for forming factions, refining the standing orders, 
and carrying out consultations on the leadership of standing 
committees and commissions. 
  [Nikiforova] Valentin Aleksandrovich, many deputies are 
taking their seats in parliament for the first time. Won't they 
prove powerless to resolve state questions? 
  [Kuptsov] We have taken account of this; that is why we are 
holding a seminar for our deputies 8 January. There we will 
give advice on the forms of participation in State Duma 
committees and commissions. 
  [Nikiforova] An all-Russia day of action by left-wing forces 
"For the Restoration of Legality and Civil Peace in the Country" 
has been appointed for 9 January. What is this? 
  [Kuptsov] It was initiated by our party organizations. It 
will be held differently in different places: meetings with 
deputies, passing on voters' mandates to them. People will meet 
in clubs and culture centers and at rallies. 
  [Nikifirova] Where will our deputies be living? 
  [Kuptsov] For the time being, in the "Rossiya" Hotel. But 
no one is there to meet them, and there is no transport. We 
hope that these are temporary difficulties.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- A parliamentary group based 
on the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin election bloc does not plan to 
participate in the new government, ITAR-TASS learnt on Thursday 
[6 January] from Igor Yakovenko, member of the group's temporary 
council and co- chairman of the Russian Republican Party. 
  "The bloc stood out during the election campaign against 
combining parliamentary work with that in government 
structures," Yakovenko, member of the State Duma (lower house), 
explained. "We ran for the State Duma for parliamentary work 
rather than for joining the cabinet," he stressed. 
  The group regards as its main task "the drafting and 
adoption 
of bills to change the mechanism of carrying economic reforms 
peacefully". Yakovenko noted that the elections corroborated 
the mechanism's inefficiency. 
  The group now numbers 30 people, but it will possibly be 
boosted by independents. The temporary council includes 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy (group chairman), Yakovenko, Vyacheslav 
Shestakovskiy, Vladimir Sheynis, Anatoliy Golov and Vladimir 
Lukin. 
  Group representatives are now working on all committees 
engaged in organising the State Duma's work. According to 
Yakovenko, the status of legislator is among the main topics of 
ongoing discussions. 
  The group suggests free rather than imperative mandate of 
lawmaker. Yakovenko said that the imperative mandate 
presupposes that a lawmaker is to vote strictly in compliance 
with a decision of a group he represents. He added that "such 
an approach is fraught with turning a legislator into a puppet". 
  Speaking about a possibility of setting up a democratic 
coalition, Yakovenko noted that "democratic groups will most 
probably cooperate to counter revenge-seeking forces". 
  He did not preclude "temporary cooperation" with Russia's 
Choice and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord as well as with 
communists and the Agrarian Party. 
  Yakovenko confirmed that the group nominated Lukin for the 
post of State Duma speaker.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Leader of the Agrarian Party [AP] of Russia Mikhail 
Lapshin says Russian troops must continue to guard the 
Tajik-Afghan border. "If not, our external borders will soon lie 
just outside Moscow," he told Interfax. 
  While hailing Russia's peacemaking role in what Russian 
diplomats describe as "near abroad" countries (meaning former 
Soviet republics), the AP leader is skeptical about Russia's 
involvement in similar operations elsewhere. In his view, 
Russia should have stayed away from the UN peace mission in the 
former Yugoslavia after betraying its fellow Slavs, notably 
Serbs there. 
  Nor does Lapshin share the foreign ministry's position on 
Iraq. "Supporting U.S. police actions is not Russia's business," 
he said, adding: "I have a vague idea of the ruling regime in 
Iraq, but regimes come and go while people stay on." 
  The electoral platform of the Agrarian Party, which consults 
on foreign policy issues with former Soviet Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, did not contain a section on 
international affairs. There are two reasons to explain this, 
Lapshin said. One is the brevity of the election campaign. The 
other -- foreign policy issues as applied to the strategy and 
tactics of the Agrarian Party, place the need for independent 
but competent experts. In our view, should the AP find itself 
to be a tiny party in the new parliament, it ought to focus on 
the farming sector's problems alone, he said, but with broader 
representation, the party would elaborate its own approach to 
foreign policy issues. 
  Judging from Lapshin's interview, the AP's approaches appear 
to be shaping up. Our party, he said, sets great store by 
Russia's economic and political independence. On foreign policy 
matters, Lapshin said the AP would stick to the concept of the 
country's self reliance for food, which among other things, 
provides for government regulation of food imports.

  [Text] Moscow, January 5 (TASS) -- A group of indepedent 
members of the newly-elected Russian State Duma announced on 
Wednesday that they plan to form an inter-regional association 
of independent deputies. 
  The group held a meeting in the parliamentary centre, where 
they approved a declaration about the association. The 
declaration says, "the association can and must became a true 
centre for the consolidation of all the State Duma's 
constructive forces". In the future the association intends to 
lobby for parliamentary faction status. 
  The declaration also states that the independent deputies, 
"who were elected in one-seat constituencies and are not 
obligated to any of the political parties or movements, are 
personally responsible before their voters, the constitution, 
and Russia as a whole". 
  The association promises to base its activity on "the 
principles of parliamentary freedom and responsibility, common 
sense, political realism and pragmatism, and respect for the 
views of other groups and factions".

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Grigoriy Atamanchuk, doctor of </F>
juridical sciences: "Reforms Lose Out in Battles for Positions 
of Power"] 
  [Text] The elections are over but the choice, it seems, 
has yet to be made: Will Russia take the path of peaceful, 
creative, and rational development, or will it continue to 
writhe in convulsions of self-flagellation and self-destruction? 
There would seem to be few alternatives, but the choice is by 
no means evident. I will not undertake to list all the causes 
which reflect and imply weakness and instability in respect of 
the democratic process, but I would like to draw attention to a 
few. First and foremost, it must be acknowledged that the 
democratic process has not yet harnessed to itself all those 
people who are notable for their autonomous position, merit, 
stable view of life, and their advanced abilities to evaluate 
something in terms of deeds, rather than words. By dint of 
their very being, these people -- let's call them "critically 
reasoning figures" -- have always been pushed aside from power 
and the solution of social problems by an authoritarian 
bureaucracy, as they did not acknowledge the rules of the 
political game being proposed. But even now, and moreover on 
the very same grounds, many of them have still not become 
respected or even equal components of the democratic process. 
  Once again they have proved unacceptable because from the 
very start of democratic reforms they argued the need for a 
balanced and serious approach, gradualness, and rational and 
systematic actions, for gearing oneself toward the interests of 
the majority of people, for a differentiated and honest approach 
to the past, both distant and recent, for morality in politics, 
and many other significant social values. People of this mold 
have long warned of the danger of "accelerated" changes without 
due account of their social consequences, the unacceptability of 
rushing headlong across the entire "front line," and the 
impossibility of relying on false stereotypes, such as the claim 
that "it is necessary to create rich people, and then the rich 
people will make the whole country rich." But few heard them, 
and they were ever more frequently accused of conservatism, 
backwardness, a failure to understand the processes and...they 
were cast out from democracy. So it is that many of them 
remained in the wings. To the detriment of democracy. 
  Moreover, it is impossible not to see that to this day the 
democratic process is somewhat cautiously and timidly based on 
science. It "trusts" only certain, staid elements, who were 
always geared toward power and prepared to serve any system for 
the sake of obtaining a portfolio. It is with equal success 
that they praised socialism, as indeed they reject it today. 
Suspicion is aroused by the fact that during the election 
campaign, for instance, the staid elements of one and the same 
branch of knowledge "split" into dozens of blocs, as if there 
can exist dozens of truths in one and the same science, on one 
and the same subject. 
  Hence the selective nature of the approach to proposed 
recommendations, the tendency to select from the them only that 
which is politically "beneficial" to somebody, and the 
orientation toward certain one-sided postulates. 
  As a result, in the policy and practise of state 
administration there is much in the way of subjectivist 
improvisation, actions geared to the moment and not to the 
future, "flitting" from one side to the other, servility in the 
face of some foreign model or other, a solicitation of "advice" 
from one visiting authority after another without due 
consideration of the fact that he represents the interests and 
views of that structure which sent him. Naturally, all this 
impacts on the country's development and it does not in fact 
advance reforms. And if we are talking about the latest 
election campaign "performances," scientific know-how in the 
sphere of social psychology was employed by the democrats 
according to the principle of "whatever it says, do the 
opposite." After actions like that, were the results of the 
Federal Assembly elections really so surprising? 
  And there is yet another aspect which abruptly catches the 
eye as a consequence of the foregoing factors: The depressing 
incompetence and aggressive ignorance of many of those who were 
swept into the offices of power on the wave of democratic 
reforms and who now set themselves up as a buttress of 
democracy. Instead of studying, trying to get to grips with the 
science, art, and experience of administration, closely watching 
what and how experienced people in other countries of the world 
do it, honestly analyzing the consequences of their deeds, 
decisions, and actions, such people found nothing better to do 
than to get drunk on power, to engage in their own pet 
development projects, and to organize "battles" for the most 
influential positions. It is their fault that a converse 
situation has arisen whereby state power is often used not to 
resolve the country's major problems, but to satisfy the 
ambitious aspirations of those who have acceded to power. 
Moreover, this type of thing is already done quite openly, in 
the public eye -- they do not shy away from it, nor do they fear 
it, but, on the contrary, they are proud of it. Does this mean 
that it is "permissible"? 
  But given that incompetence makes itself known, and that 
sooner or later it becomes obvious -- thanks, in fact, to the 
failure to resolve vital problems -- the incompetent 
periodically "seek out" culprits responsible for their own lack 
of talent, be this in the form of the apparatus which is 
allegedly putting the brakes on reforms, or in the form of 
former partyocrats apparently distorting reforms, or the 
regional elite which pursues its own mercenary interests, or 
nationalist forces which do not understand the advantages of an 
integral state, or the director, or the farmer, or whoever. In 
the years of Soviet power, indeed prior to the revolution even, 
a great deal of "experience" had accumulated in respect of the 
quest for enemies, so there is no need to devise anything new 
here, it is sufficient to recall famous times gone by. 
  In brief, there are many symptoms which give rise to alarm 
over the fate of the democratic path toward the development of 
the fatherland. 
  No doubt it is time to take something of a new look at the 
bases and capacities of the democratic process, and not only to 
strengthen the substance and efficiency of the reforms under 
way, but also to update significantly the basic lineup of 
reformers, and to bring into it those professionally trained, 
morally pure people who for whatever reason are still "in 
obscurity." Not because they oppose the democratic process: 
They do support it, but they will not accept those methods, 
means, and forms via which this process is unfurling. There was 
a time when the October cause was saved by the involvement 
therein of so-called bourgeois elements. Something like this 
needs to be done now: It is necessary to draw into the 
democratic process all those who value Russia and hold it close 
to their heart. 
  The development and appearance of infamous trends shows that 
the main thrust of the battle for democracy lies not in the past 
but in the future, when the incompetence and irresponsibility of 
many who have latched onto democracy will have to be paid for. 
It is worth preparing for this future today by reinforcing and 
expanding the democratic process.

Like in Moscow?"] 
  [Text] There are attempts to blow up the comparative 
political quiet in Moscow since the events of 3-4 October last 
year. Representatives of a number of opposition movements -- 
the "Russian National Union," the "National Salvation Front," 
and "Working Moscow" -- have stated their intention to hold mass 
protest actions 9, 11, and 12 January "against the 21 
September-4 October coup d'etat" and also to show their negative 
attitude toward the start of the new parliament's work. 
  Your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent was told at the Moscow 
city hall state and law administration that whether the 
demonstrations will take place will be decided 5 January at 1200 
hours at a meeting between the city's executive power and the 
opposition leaders. 
  Will these politicians not turn the 1994 Christmas holidays 
into a 1905 "bloody Sunday?"

<F P=106> [Article by political scientist Aleksey Kiva: "A Different </F>
Russia... A View of the Results of the Parliamentary Elections 
From the Angle of Our Immediate Future"] 
  [Text] Hoping That Fate Itself Has Not Toyed Too 
Long... 
  I cannot shake off the thought that once again -- I am 
referring to the parliamentary elections and Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's unexpected success -- unknown laws of the 
historical process are toying with us. 
  The success of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
is at the same time an answer to the historically significant 
question of whether revenge by communism is possible in the 
foreseeable future. The answer is: It is not possible. This 
is also a shattering defeat for the bloc of national-patriotic 
forces grouped around the newspaper DEN and similar publications 
and exemplified by the National Salvation Front [NSF]. Who 
remembers the NSF now? Yet only a little while ago its leaders 
were terrorizing the Supreme Soviet, calling the political tune 
for Ruslan Khasbulatov, and making a puppet of Aleksandr 
Rutskoy; it was primarily they who were the source of the threat 
of a constitutional coup, they who were the organizers of direct 
actions to seize power, as demonstrated 3-4 October. 
  So far we have twice witnessed the phenomenon of self-defeat 
by the forces of the past: communism as a social system in 1991 
and the soviets as the organ of state power of that system in 
1993. Maybe in Zhirinovskiy and his LDPR we have a new 
phenomenon -- the phenomenon of self-exposure. In other words, 
the transformation into a dead end of the destructive energy 
gradually accumulated over the years and the decades in society 
during the years of communist rule and later generated by every 
conceivable and inconceivable means by the NSF leaders, other 
communopatriotic organizations, and also the mass media. It has 
already happened more than once in history that the danger of a 
particular social phenomenon has been removed because it has 
suddenly acquired grotesque features in society's eyes. That is 
not a categorical assertion; rather it is an assumption or 
hypothesis. 
<H5>  The Same Two Poles All Over Again? </H5>
  "What a strange and fateful country is Russia!" Ilya 
Erenburg 
wrote in his article "The Poles," published in Kiev in 1919. 
"It is as though the only colors left for it on the divine 
palette were black and white." You cannot help recalling these 
words when you think about what may lie in store for us. The 
two years until the next parliamentary and presidential 
elections in our dramatic life will probably move as swiftly as 
a play based on a book by Agatha Christie. And what will 
happen? The political center has collapsed as an influential 
force, and the polarization among the political elite has 
unfortunately also affected society itself, albeit not yet on a 
large scale. As yet there is no sign of either a second or a 
third echelon to take the place of the current democrats without 
detriment to our future civilized development. Yet at present 
radical trends are merely gathering strength. 
  Experience of postsocialist development in Europe shows that 
the parties that have undertaken the extremely difficult mission 
of transforming the deathly economy and deathly political system 
into something viable with mechanisms for self-development 
through their reforming activity at the same time call into 
being negative processes and phenomena in the socioeconomic and 
spiritual and moral spheres which mean that they are usually 
defeated in the next elections. Their defeat is usually to the 
benefit of left-wing forces that have emerged from communism. 
Lithuania, Poland -- the list goes on. 
  At present we have no such forces, and there is not even 
any sign of them. When Viktor Ilyukhin, one of the leaders of 
the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], was asked 
about the party's drift toward social democracy, he answered in 
the negative, claiming that this is just tactics. "If we had 
approached voters with extreme left-wing slogans, we would 
inevitably have lost the elections." That is frank. In the 
pure bolshevik style. 
  But neither do we have any sign of an alternative on the 
right of the current ruling democrats. "Yabloko" 
[Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc]? The PRUA [Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord]? It is doubtful. Maybe, instead of the 
possible transformation of the Communists into social democrats, 
a bloc will emerge on the left made up partly of 
"Gorbachevites," partly of industrialists, partly of agrarians, 
and partly of moderate nationalists? In short, at present we 
are left with the same old gloomy bipolar picture. Will the 
Communists be replaced by nationalists? In general the current 
authorities have to forecast what the political spectrum may be 
in two years' time. And not only forecast it, but so far as 
possible channel the social process in a civilized direction. 
<H5>  Zhirinovskiy As a Barometer of Russians' Social Temperature </H5>
  Nevertheless, let us return to our topic, so to speak. The 
wave of emotion in viewing the election results has abated. The 
hysterics from the particularly "neurotic" section of our 
intelligentsia have largely ended. Admittedly, a new round of 
moaning about other topics has begun. A considerable proportion 
of the intelligentsia has never grasped the simple truth that 
democracy is an expensive and troublesome business, and the 
intelligentsia's characteristic maximalist approach is totally 
unacceptable here. 
  So the time has come for more civilized assessments, 
profound 
analysis of what has happened, trustworthy conclusions, and 
appropriate decisions. The tone of the serious press, 
statements by representatives of the establishment, and recent 
steps by the president show that the decline in the population's 
interest in the elections and referendum, the LDPR's unexpected 
success, and the unrealized hopes of "Russia's Choice" have been 
seen as a warning. And it has been heeded. The immediate future 
will indicate whether it has been properly heeded. However, a 
few fundamentally important details of the latest scene in the 
Russian political drama remain backstage. Nor can the audience 
see the prompters. Not everything is clear about the LDPR's 
success. At the same time it is totally obvious that however we 
describe Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's ideological and political views 
(neofascism, national-chauvinism, and so forth), however we 
explain his success, and whatever future we forecast for this 
success, today we are living in a different Russia from the 
country that existed prior to the elections. Neither better nor 
worse -- simply different. Reality is becoming increasingly 
complex and increasingly multidimensional, with more and more 
factors determining the vector of social development, and this 
development itself is becoming less and less unilinear and 
predictable. 
  Essentially Russia is now different from the old familiar 
country that existed on the eve of the elections. It is simply 
that many of us have failed to notice this. We have failed to 
notice that the rules of the political game have changed 
fundamentally. The multiparty system and free access by parties 
to the mass media, the different capacities of different 
participants in the election campaign to pay for and exploit 
airtime, in general the different approaches toward the election 
campaign itself, the absence of an established political culture 
and traditions of parliamentarianism, and the pursuit of 
different moral (or immoral) imperatives objectively also 
created different conditions of political struggle. It's like 
the proverb: Nothing ventured, nothing gained. 
<H5>  Dangerous Specter </H5>
  But, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. 
Rephrasing our unforgettable classics, let us say that the 
elections highlighted a specter that has begun to haunt Russia 
-- the specter of authorities that are out of touch with the 
people. So when the democratic public, frightened by 
Zhirinovskiy's neo-Nazi slogans and appeals, hastens to set up 
an antifascist movement in the country, I assert the following. 
Yes, such a movement must be created for we have already come 
face to face with fascism during the 3-4 October events. But 
the antifascist movement, if it is destined to exist, must not 
be reduced to the struggle against the LDPR. I emphasize, I 
constantly have the feeling that the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon," 
for all its possible dangers, is merely a timely warning to 
society. An even more serious danger -- unless, of course, the 
response is appropriate to the challenge -- may emerge from 
behind the not overly broad back of Vladimir Volfovich or from 
another direction entirely. Furthermore, his success has come as 
a surprise to Zhirinovskiy himself, and developments during the 
realization of this success may come as a surprise to us. 
  The prevailing opinion is emerging that Zhirinovskiy 
skillfully reaped a harvest that he had certainly not sown. In 
other words, the votes for the LDPR were a transmogrified 
protest by our citizens against current living conditions. 
Correct. But this is not only a social protest, although that 
may be the predominant element. Discontent has built up in many 
areas. That is on top of the fact that many people have lost 
their accustomed status. And on top of the extremely negative 
fact of the lumpenization of a considerable section of the 
intelligentsia. 
  First, there is crime and corruption. This is also a social 
and, as we know, serious problem, although it is mixed up with a 
lot of half-truths and downright lies thanks to the endeavors of 
the opponents of reform and the superficiality of our journalism 
and simply of stupid people. It will take more than three 
months, three years, or even thirty years to put a stop to them. 
Crime, corruption included, will exist as long as man lives, 
given that he is by no means a holy product of nature. This is 
shown by the experience of the most stable, "well fed," and 
law-abiding nations. In any case, we by no means lead the world 
in terms of the number of crimes. 
  The problem, in my view, lies in, on the one hand, sharply 
reducing the most dangerous and worrying types of crime, 
especially organized crime, and, on the other, convincing 
society of the seriousness of the authorities' intentions, so 
that the crude lie about the "criminal revolution" and "criminal 
authorities" does not stick like mud to the reformers, 
particularly in the upper echelon of power. However, there is 
just one aspect to the problem. The reformers themselves must 
be clean, and the president and premier must be uncompromising 
in combating this evil. There is more need of glasnost here 
than in any other sphere. We must create conditions in which it 
is difficult for corruption to spread. 
  Second, many people are feeling bad about the disintegration 
of the USSR, many people still have relatives in nearby foreign 
countries. Many people have lost their accustomed links and 
contacts and their accustomed way of life. Not to mention those 
for whom identity as an empire and superpower is the supreme 
value in itself; who would reduce their own mother to poverty 
for the sake of reveling in our military might and experiencing 
paroxysms of joy at the very thought that we are feared in the 
world and regarded as an "evil empire" and that we are capable 
of destroying all life on earth several times over; and who 
seriously believe in the possibility of restoring the USSR or 
the Russian empire and are prepared to countenance a bloodbath 
for this. All this must be explained to people. But there is a 
need for particular tact here. However, we must also tell the 
truth: Attempts to save the USSR by force would have meant a 
real tragedy for the peoples. 
  Third, not only history, but also the communopatriots were 
on 
Zhirinovskiy's side. Revanchist forces conducted real 
psychological warfare against the president, the democrats, and 
Russian democracy in general effectively under the protection of 
the Supreme Soviet. The nationalists, together with the 
communists, managed to create in the eyes of a section of the 
Russian people a false image of a humiliated country acting at 
the bidding of the West and especially the United States and 
selling off its national assets. As though following the 
behests of Dr. Goebbels, the communopatriotic press kept on 
repeating absurd, deliberately false and simply insulting claims 
about Boris Yeltsin's "occupation regime," the "government of 
national betrayal and treachery," and "colonial democracy," 
called for a "national liberation struggle," urged the people to 
"rise up for a fight to the death," and so forth. In other 
words, it created an "enemy image" not only outside but also 
inside the country in an attempt to bring about the effect of 
wounded national pride characterizing Germany on the eve of the 
fascists' arrival in power. Clearly, this succeeded to some 
extent. And this happened at a time when Russia, as the legal 
successor to the USSR, remains a nuclear superpower and enjoys 
great political clout in the world. 
  Fourth, when you consider that Zhirinovskiy is more of a 
good 
actor than a stage manager, his stage management is highly 
professional. He not only "privatized" virtually all the sore 
points of a society that has just embarked on the path of 
transition from totalitarianism to democracy but also keeps in 
mind the particular features of our national character and 
traditions, taking account of our strong and weak points. His 
attention focused on the following: the tendency of many of us 
at least to rely on simple and speedy solutions, including 
strong-arm solutions, the fear of independence, the habit at the 
drop of a hat of looking to the all-powerful state, which has to 
look after us, the continuing longing for a "master" who would 
emerge and "impose order," and the ineradicable belief in 
honeyed promises and simple gullibility. 
<H5>  Even Cats Like a Kind Word </H5>
  What do the many people tired of poverty and hungry for 
rapid 
change care about Gaydar's macroeconomic schemes when Vladimir 
Volfovich promises to change life for the better as soon as they 
vote for him! To some people he promises free underwear, to 
others vodka, and to others entire countries on a plate. 
  Psychologists who have made a special study of the 
personality of Zhirinovskiy have said how skillfully he exploits 
the stereotypes of behavior which were developed in society over 
many years of totalitarianism and which have by no means 
vanished but have merely entered a state of latency and, given 
the opportunity, are ready to immediately proclaim their 
existence. Take the problem of the hatred that was constantly 
fueled in Soviet society -- only its targets have changed. It 
is simple to make political capital out of hatred that can be 
easily aroused in conditions of crisis and directed against "yid 
masons," or "Caucasian nationals," or those who are "selling the 
homeland down the river." 
  The psychologists emphasized that direct criticism, 
especially crude attacks on the LDPR leader, will inevitably 
boomerang. 
  I don't know whether Zhirinovskiy would have been helped by 
hypnosis or psychotherapy if the democrats in various blocs and 
parties had not confused people; if society had not been in a 
state of deep crisis; if many people had not been so disoriented 
and troubled; and if the democrats had done what they ought to 
have done as democrats right from the first steps in the 
emergence of the new Russian statehood and new social system. 
  What is really bothering people? Poverty? Yes, of course. 
But that is not what bothered us. The most oppressive thing is 
the apparent lack of any glimmer of light or prospects for the 
future. The disintegration of absolutely everything. The 
collapse of familiar principles and the values established over 
the years of Soviet power. The ones who find themselves in the 
most difficult position are elderly people and in part young 
people, many of whom are simply drifting with the current. Is 
this not why so many young people followed in "Zhirinovskiy's 
wake"? 
<H5>  Where Are We Heading </H5>
  Many people have simply lost their heads in the face of the 
flourishing criminal business, raging "wild capitalism," the 
insolent behavior of the "nouveaux riches," the rampant crime, 
and the irritating behavior of our advertising, which has no 
sense of proportion or tact, in the face of a whole series of 
antisocial and antispiritual phenomena. They are fed up with 
communism, alias real socialism, and they do not want any return 
to the past, but they can in no way come to terms with what is 
taking its place. It is natural for questions such as "What are 
we building?" and "Where are we heading?" to arise in such 
conditions. 
  And instead of attempting to answer these questions, to 
remove our fellow citizens' concern, and to explain to them that 
all this filth is the price society is forced to pay for the 
crimes of communism, which pushed the country out of its natural 
channel of development; that at the same time this is the price 
that must be paid in order to create eventually normal economic 
and social relations as the basis for our prosperity; that we 
have to put up with this filth as other peoples have done in 
order to avoid coming full circle and finding ourselves back in 
long lines facing empty shelves in the stores like our Ukrainian 
brothers, for instance; that we are almost on the point of more 
or less getting out of this filth -- in the face of all this the 
democrats arrogantly say: "We are laying the foundations of a 
new society in accordance with common sense and world 
experience, as other peoples have done." 
  The people want to know what our social ideal is, what our 
new values are, what our new spirituality is. If their 
questions are not answered by the democrats, they will turn -- 
and in part already are turning -- to other political forces. 
  In the extremely difficult struggle against the forces of 
the 
past, against the numerous and diverse forces of reaction, the 
democrats have consciously or otherwise surrendered to their 
political opponents some extremely important values revered by 
the people and capable of rallying them in the fight for the 
country's future. These include the ideals of social justice, 
patriotism, statehood, and lofty spirituality. These values 
must be won back without fail, especially as this process has 
already begun. Unless, of course, the democrats want to be 
defeated, thereby dooming the young Russian democracy to defeat 
as well. 
  Last. In the years since August 1991 the democrats were 
concerned primarily to destroy the material and spiritual 
foundation of communism and prevent it from being revived. This 
is understandable. The forces of revenge are a real threat to 
our progress. But the focus of the struggle must now be 
shifted. I am convinced that the only social model that can be 
successfully implemented in our country is one which from the 
outset attaches exceptionally great importance to the social 
aspect of change and is geared, if you like, toward state 
paternalism, as in Japan, and toward preventing severe social 
contrasts. In the struggle between the two principles of 
freedom and social justice that has dragged on over the 
centuries, it is the latter that will triumph in our country 
unless we succeed in harmonizing them. 
  And in this connection it is very annoying, no, very 
worrying that the democratic authorities seem to have divested 
themselves of everyday concern for people, or at any rate have 
not created appropriate mechanisms for this. But people who 
have grown up in the specific conditions of real socialism are 
often not yet ready for the independence characteristic of other 
countries. During the transitional period at least something 
must take the place of raykoms [party rayon committees]. In 
this sense Zhirinovskiy played the role of litmus paper. He 
visited many krays and oblasts. He said what people wanted to 
hear and flattered them. He praised. Persuaded. Reassured. 
Promised. And people took this as a display of attention, as a 
show of concern for them. And they responded. 
<H5>  What Is To Be Done? </H5>
  The first conclusion. The policy of reforms "in all 
directions," so to speak, must be adjusted. I do not think it 
should be fundamentally changed. A coalition government? I do 
not think that would be sensible. Everything must be directed 
toward easing the situation of the most underprivileged section 
of the population as much as possible. 
  The task of combating crime and corruption must become just 
as much of a priority. It is time to realize that these two 
problems have become extremely acute sociopolitical, spiritual, 
and moral problems, and the sympathies of the broad people's 
masses will be won by the side that can prove that it is capable 
of dealing with them. 
  The second conclusion. The government must react more 
sensitively than ever to the mood of the masses, on the one 
hand, and explain, persuade, and prove the correctness of its 
line and the inevitability of passing through a stage of 
difficulties and the accompanying multitude of glaring 
antisocial phenomena, on the other hand. It must show more 
clearly what will happen if we turn aside from the course of 
reform and attempt to introduce a different model of 
transformations in present conditions. 
  The third conclusion. The questions "What are we building?" 
and "Where are we heading?" must be answered at the highest 
level. The answer must be intelligent and immediate. Society 
needs a social, spiritual, and moral ideal. It is simply 
impossible to manage without this -- at least in our country. 
But all this will be left hanging in the air unless we begin 
building democratic parties. And not just a presidential party. 
We need a mass democratic party, in the spirit of struggle for 
a "society of universal well-being," if you like. 
  The fourth conclusion. We must finally formulate the 
philosophy of national-state development and clarify its 
components. I reiterate: It is unforgivable that the democrats 
have left the idea of statehood and patriotism to those who, 
when it comes down to it, are neither patriots nor state-minded, 
if you mean by state-minded someone who fights for a social, 
democratic state called upon to serve the people rather than 
enslave them and to expend the country's resources in the 
interests of improving the people's well-being rather than waste 
them, as happened under the communists. 
  The fifth and final conclusion. Foreign policy, including 
policy toward the nearby foreign countries, must also be 
adjusted in the light of the changes taking place in the 
country. Although I think it already is undergoing major 
adjustments.

"Barkashov Meets With Military Prosecutor's Office"] 
  [Text] What was their conversation about? -- some analysts 
are now trying to answer this question. The point is that, 
according to one of the numerous versions associated with the 
name of Aleksandr Barkashov, the investigation into the 
participation of Russian National Unity's leader and his 
subordinates in the events of bloody October 93 has been ended. 
The "Barkashovites'" departure from the House of Soviets 
building before the start of combat operations is being advanced 
as an argument. 
  Another question arises in this connection: Was the clash in 
which Barkashov was seriously wounded not the consequence of his 
initiation into certain details concerning the shooting up of 
the parliament building? According to information received by 
the editorial office the Russian National Unity leader was 
wounded in the back by automatic fire from a VAZ-2108 vehicle. 
And... -- a new detail emerges here -- ...it was his friends 
who picked him up, not a passing vehicle at all. As has been 
stated, it was they who took him to the hospital, giving a false 
name in the interests of personal security, because they feared 
not the official authorities but the same people who had 
instigated the shooting. In this context the information that 
Barkashov's supporters themselves appealed to the Internal 
Affairs organs 29 December, requesting that protection for their 
leader be organized, looks quite plausible. According to the 
same version the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] did take 
such measures and transferred Barkashov to its own departmental 
hospital. 
  Various high-ranking officials in the MVD and General 
Prosecutor's Office refused to confirm or deny this version. 
Nevertheless, it is contradicted by information that the Russian 
National Unity Council has made a statement accusing militia 
organs of making an attempt on Barkashov's life and warning that 
it reserves the right to carry out its own investigation and 
take adequate measures to protect its leader, with all that that 
entails. 
  At the same time we have learned that yesterday the Military 
Prosecutor's Office sent its investigators to the same MVD 
hospital where Barkashov is staying and began investigative 
activities.

  [Text] The strike to be staged by Russian newspaper 
journalists, timed to coincide with the parliamentary week of 
10-17 January, may actually take place. A POSTFAKTUM 
correspondent has learned that this evening all the editorial 
offices on the territory of Russia will receive faxes containing 
an appeal to strike from the two unions of journalists, of 
Russia and of Moscow. 
  ITAR-TASS provides information about a number of demands 
being submitted to the government of the Russian Federation by 
journalists of the organizations, with yet another appeal to 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. Journalists think it necessary to 
establish purpose-orientated subsidies for all editions for the 
first half of 1994 to provide for the publication of issues that 
have already been paid for by subscribers.

  [Text] Yesterday, editors-in-chief of key Russian 
publications were still considering calling a strike to protest 
the newspapers' critical economic situation. It was decided to 
call a warning strike in the first "parliamentary week" -- from 
10 to 17 January. Three newspapers disagreed with the decision, 
including ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, and 
also KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (spokesmen for the last newspaper expressed 
their solidarity with the "strikers"). It soon transpired, 
however, that Mr. Chernomyrdin is ready to meet with the 
editors-in-chief today to talk about all the existing 
disagreements.

  [Text] Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's meeting with 
representatives of the association of publishers and chief 
editors of the leading newspapers will be held either tonight or 
on Thursday. The agreement to hold the meeting was reached at 
the conference today of First Vice Prime Minister Vladimir 
Shumeyko, supervising the Press Ministry, with chief editors of 
the leading newspapers. 
  The meeting was attended by the chief editors of such 
newspapers as "TRUD" (Potapov), "ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA" (Natalya 
Polezhayeva), "KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA" (Vladislav Fronin), 
"IZVESTIYA" (first deputy chief editor Nikolay Bodnaruk) as well 
as the chairman of the state committee for the mass media, Boris 
Mironov, and the first secretary of the Moscow Journalists' 
Union, Ludmila Scherbina. 
  Prior to this, the association of publishers and chief 
editors, unions of journalists of Moscow and Russia, Fund for 
Protection of Glasnost and other journalist organizations sent a 
letter to the prime minister listing their demands for saving 
the Russian press from a crisis. 
  In particular, they demanded revising the government 
decision 
to recalculate the basic funds of printing, communications, pulp 
and paper and other cooperating industries, granting journalists 
the right to participate in the privatization of printing 
enterprises and other facilities, introducing subsidies for 
timely issuing of pre-paid editions, and lower taxes imposed on 
the mass media. 
  In their letter, journalists proposed the prime minister 
"immediately receive representatives from the press and 
journalist organizations."

  [Text] The chief editors of virtually all newspapers 
published in Moscow have decided to strike on 10 January. They 
have taken this action because publishing houses have increased 
by several times the cost of their services, referring to a 
government decision on reassessing production assets. According 
to the editors, this will make the future existence of their 
publications impossible. KOMERSANT, which is not worried about 
any price rises, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, which is restrained by army 
discipline, the NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER, which does not cooperate 
with the government and wants nothing from it, and the 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, which believes that it is not the government 
but the printing trades who have incorrectly fixed tariffs that 
one should be fighting, will not be taking part in the strike.

<F P=106> [Chief editor Vitaliy Tretyakov article: "If `NG' Does Not </F>
Appear Next Week. We All Are in the Clutches of the State"] 
  [Text] Our readers will know that an absolute majority of 
dailies and weeklies of Moscow and of all Russia are ready to 
interrupt their publication for the duration of the next week. 
As this issue of "NG" is going to print (the last issue during 
this "short" pre-Christmas week), such a decision was confirmed 
at the conference of chief editors that took place last night. 
Readers are entitled to know what "NG" editors are being guided 
by in this protest action. 
  First and foremost, this is no classic strike. The editorial 
office will work, gather information, and journalists will write 
articles. True, the newspaper will not be printed. Subscribers 
and readers in general will be the worse for it, as well as the 
numerous "NG" contributors whose articles are in next week's 
plans but will not be published. On behalf of the editorial 
office I apologize to all of them, but we have to do this. 
  "NG" was not the initiator of this action, yet it will take 
part in it because it has more than once experienced not only 
the absence of journalist solidarity in Moscow and Russia (the 
story of our repeat registration), but also a direct and 
aggressive non-solidarity (attacks on "NG" and other newspapers 
for the "blank spaces" instead of censured material). 
  Not many people understand the main economic sense of 
journalists' demands. Stripped of unessential nuances, the crux 
of the problem is as follows. 
  The revaluation of the fixed assets introduced by government 
decree No. 1233 automatically leads to an increase in all and 
sundry payments and taxes, etc. To be effected by the owners of 
these assets. In our case, by the printing and publishing 
complexes. They would naturally put the burden on their 
customers, or newspapers and magazines. Hence there will be a 
doubling or quadrupling (to begin with) of the costs of printing 
services for editorial offices. According to one version, there 
is not a direct dependence here, because printers capitalized on 
this decree in their own interests. 
  Why was "NG" not the first to propose this action? Just 
because the relatively small print run of our newspaper takes 
smaller funds than of those newspapers whose circulation runs to 
1 million copies. While we paid, say, 10 million in December, in 
January we will be obliged to pay 40 million, i.e. 30 million 
over and above. A newspaper publishing 1 million copies would 
have to pay 400 million in January instead of 100 million rubles 
in December, meaning that it would have to "find" another 300 
million. 
  But the thing is that it is the state that owns all printing 
shops in Russia, as it owned them in the USSR before. A 
complete monopoly has been preserved here. Therefore, all of us 
-- and you, readers, too -- are in the clutches of this state. 
Or more precisely, the government that runs this property and 
us all as it sees fit. 
  It needs only one thing: a monopoly on the distribution of 
information. Which is why the freedom of speech in Russia is 
hanging by a thread. It is there but it is hanging. Thus it 
will perhaps exist until the government becomes sick of it. 
  Till we meet again in 10 days or perhaps earlier? 
  We shall see.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Silence Again?"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] In the past few days a lot of 
questions from readers have been coming into our newspaper's 
editorial office: Will SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA support its 
colleagues' action? Even without this the newspaper was 
unlawfully closed down for almost three months, and subscribers 
failed to receive a great deal of important, true information 
about a whole period in the life of Russia and the world. 
Surely we will not be left without a newspaper again, they ask 
worriedly. 
  Although we fully share the undoubtedly just indignation of 
our journalist colleagues at the prevailing price chaos and 
bureaucratic chaos, we are nevertheless forced to say no to the 
collective protest action. We hold too dear the possibility -- 
recently infrequent -- of communicating with our readers, we 
have too much to say, we have too many lies to refute. For us, 
the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA journalists, silence is a luxury we 
cannot afford. 
  We have our own score to settle with the present 
authorities, 
and it too is not small. No one intends to compensate for the 
losses to readers and the journalists' collectives which were 
brought about by the unlawful closure of the newspaper, and 
subscriptions to our newspapers are being hindered and blocked 
in every way at the mail offices. Every conceivable and 
inconceivable obstacle is placed on the path of every issue of 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA published. The situation is exacerbated many 
times by the fact that the editorial office's current account 
was unlawfully impounded literally until yesterday. Because of 
this we are not in a position to settle our accounts with our 
partners in the production and distribution of the newspaper in 
a timely fashion. 
  In the face of this, to be published, to get through to the 
reader, having penetrated the cordon of obstacles, means to 
conquer.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 5 (AFP) -- Six Russian newspapers said 
Wednesday that they would suspend publication for one week from 
Monday, during US President Bill Clinton's visit, to protest 
against government restrictions on the press. 
  The shutdown, which had initially been threatened during a 
press conference Tuesday, was sparked by a November 25 
government decision that would cause a sixfold rise in newspaper 
production costs. 
  The newspapers consider this as the latest move to strangle 
Russia's emerging independent media, and blame the government 
for fighting to control the mass media rather than to guarantee 
freedom of the press. 
  The six politically diverse newspapers -- IZVESTIYA, 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, 
MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA and VECHERNAYA MOCKVA -- will be shut down 
for at least one week from January 10, according to a decision 
by their editors. 
  Russian journalists' union president Vsevolod Bogdanov said 
that a majority of local and regional newspapers would also join 
the movement. 
  The editors said, however, that they would be willing to 
renounce the suspension if an immediate solution to their 
problem was found.

<F P=106> [Open letter to Russian Federation Government: "Defend Free </F>
Speech" -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI headline] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr Chairman! 
  Esteemed members of Government! 
  For several days there have been reports in various mass 
media and on television and the radio concerning the closure of 
the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, the inaugurator of which was 
the former Russian Federation Council of Ministers. The reason 
for the destruction of a newspaper which in the course of the 
past year has become one of Russia's leading publications, and 
one, moreover, with its own identity (which is very rare for the 
present rich newspaper market) is the decision of the 
journalists' collective to become the founder of its newspaper. 
In our view the arguments for and aims of this decision are set 
forth with full justification in published items (ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI Nos. 250, 254, and 1-2). 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's desire to become an autonomous and free 
representative of the mass media, independent of organs of 
power, cannot and should not be viewed as a compromise or an 
attempt to enter into opposition with the government. On the 
contrary, we are sure that the theme of power and society, the 
theme of the establishment of Russian statehood, which have been 
the main ones in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI and its supplement -- VEKHI, 
the newspaper of the independent intelligentsia -- must remain 
leading ones. It is this free and open expression of feelings 
and profound thoughts about Russia's paths, its economy, 
politics, and culture, and about man above all, which must not 
be fettered by any bureaucratic pressure or membership of the 
apparatus. 
  In the democratic state which we have proclaimed and in 
which 
we are all learning to live there should be no "vassal press." 
Otherwise we shall return again to the obedient semi-official 
organ of PRAVDA and authoritarian methods of leadership. 
  As readers of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI we cannot fail to note that 
the VEKHI supplement is as of today the only platform to express 
the views and arguments, positions and creations of the most 
diverse writers, journalists, critics, historians, philosophers, 
and art critics. 
  Do not allow the destruction of a child in whose birth you 
yourselves were involved! Defend the interests of our fellow 
citizens and readers who have chosen ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. And 
there are 600,000 of them.

<F P=106> [Maks Khazin article: "Barannikov Versus Filatov. </F>
Background to Former Russian Security Minister's Suit"] 
  [Text] The plaintiff did not show up for the first 
session. I do not think he will appear for the second or for any 
of the subsequent sessions -- however many there may be. But 
the trial will take its course, because the reason for the 
plaintiff's nonappearance is a very good one -- the jail 
governor will not let him out.... Nonetheless, nobody has the 
right to forbid even someone under arrest from using the legal 
process to uphold his honor and dignity. V. Barannikov has 
availed himself of this right. Yes, it is the very same man who 
was formerly minister of internal affairs and subsequently 
Russian security minister. 
  Just who defamed his honor and dignity so painfully that the 
twice ex-minister -- who, judging by everything, will have by no 
means the last place in the dock during the criminal trial 
(which, you will agree, would seriously distract anyone from 
worldly concerns) -- sufficiently for him to bring a civil suit? 
  It is clear from his statement that the suit was prompted by 
the TV program "Moment of Truth," in which the interviewee -- 
Sergey Filatov, leader of the Russian Federation President's 
Administration -- termed Barannikov's behavior "treachery," 
clearly claiming that he had "worked for two camps." It is 
these expressions in quotation marks that the plaintiff is 
seeking to refute through the courts. 
  Without in any way predetermining the court's ruling or 
impinging on its prerogatives and powers, I would nonetheless 
like to dwell initially on two purely formal points. 
  First, why was the defendant named as the "All-Union (?) 
State Television and Radio Company"? What millennium are we 
living in, Dear Friends? Where is that Union? 
  Second, why was presenter Andrey Karaulov named as a 
defendant? After all, as is well known, he is an interviewer, he 
asks questions -- he has no responsibility for the quality or 
accuracy of the answers. Did he perhaps suggest the answers? 
The plaintiff does not make this claim. Consequently, the 
defendant is a man who listened (like millions of viewers) to 
what the interviewee said. In Barannikov's opinion, this should 
cost him dear. But more of that later.... 
  We say notion of the fact that this is an attempt to rebut 
not a widespread and allegedly inaccurate report, but an 
assessment of someone's behavior -- a judgment that any citizen 
is legally entitled to make. A patient, while not denying that 
he had numerous symptoms of a certain disease, could with equal 
success angrily contest the diagnosis reached by the doctor. 
This is all the more pertinent as Barannikov does not dispute 
the fact that he was indeed in a different "camp" during the 
famous events. 
  But, I repeat, the courts will decide all this. S. Filatov 
and A. Karaulov do not need my help or protection; their lawyers 
are highly qualified and have repeatedly confirmed their 
reputation as very experienced counsel. 
  But there is one aspect whose importance goes beyond this 
particular case. 
  The law allows plaintiffs in cases of this sort to seek 
compensation from defendants for the moral wrong done them, 
setting the sum at their own discretion. And it is envisaged 
that people concerned about their reputation will not be 
unrealistic and that they have two true friends -- logic and 
common sense. 
  How much do you think V. Barannikov wants for this 
"dishonor"? Don't be shy, let's talk big money, using the 
minimum wage as the starting point -- 100,000, 200,000, 500,000? 
Wrong. Surely not a million? Wrong again. How much then? One 
hundred million. Per person. A total of 200 million. 
  Well, I could understand if the suit were against some 
commercial structure -- best of all foreign -- with the ability 
to invite the wives of high-ranking law enforcement officers to 
Switzerland at its own expense, put them up in a swanky hotel, 
and pay for them to visit jewelry and fur stores. 
(Incidentally, there is no information from Barannikov or 
Dunayev to refute this report). The firm could stand it. But, 
even if we seriously suppose that the courts find for the 
plaintiff, how can two, albeit presumably highly paid, state 
servants be expected to come up with this much? 
  The fact is that nobody expects them to. It is no more than 
a bold gesture. And no allowances should be made for the 
stressful situation in which the plaintiff finds himself, or for 
his being unaccustomed to this situation and the prison regime. 
Another court is hearing a suit brought by his nearby cellmate, 
former Vice President A. Rutskoy. This suit is again for 200 
million, but it was brought by him, before his arrest, from the 
unstressful quiet of his own office. 
  I have written about this too (IZVESTIYA No. 197 of 15 
October): These absurd lawsuits against the mass media emerge 
because the plaintiffs have been relieved of the necessity to 
pay the state's costs. Any other plaintiff seeking more than 
1,000 rubles [R] through the courts is obliged to pay 15 percent 
of the sum sought before the trial starts. Otherwise the judge 
will not accept the suit. Incidentally, there has been a 
proposal to extend this procedure by presidential edict to 
defamation cases as well. 
  Doctor of Juridical Sciences Professor I. Noy, a well-known 
academic, replied to the previous article. He too agrees that 
the situation is abnormal, but proposes a simpler solution -- 
abolishing Paragraph 11 of Russian Federation Supreme Soviet 
Decree No. 11 of 18 August 1992 "On Certain Issues Arising 
During Court Hearings of Defamation Cases Against Citizens and 
Organizations." Indeed, this paragraph allows the courts to seek 
state costs under such cases only in the amount of...R10. I. 
Noy believes that the law "On State Costs" has been wrongly 
interpreted in this instance. 
  Changing the existing procedure would have no impact on the 
right of citizens and corporations to uphold their honor, 
dignity, and business reputation. But it is these nonmaterial 
categories that will take priority in attempts to bring court 
cases. The desire on this basis to win a couple of hundred 
million (or simply to scare people) should, in our view, incur a 
natural commercial risk.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Shevelev report under the "Market" rubric: "`Echo' </F>
Up for Grabs"] 
  [Text] January promises to be a turning point in the 
history of the "Ekho Moskvy" radio station. Its future will 
depend on whose capital it will manage to attract. The largest 
independent radio station already boasts an audience of 4 
million listeners or so. 
  In Moscow and Moscow Oblast, where "Ekho" is on the air, it 
has already presented serious competition for "Radio Rossii" and 
"Mayak." By the end of 1993, however, it became obvious that 
"Ekho's" financial position does not look as bright as its 
approval rating. Wear and tear on its equipment has begun 
affecting the quality of broadcasting. Meager salaries by 
comparison with, say, music radio stations, force journalists to 
look for extra income or to go into business. 
  If "Ekho Moskvy" is to survive, it has no other choice but 
to 
attract outside capital. There have been so far two candidates 
courting this "bride" -- the "Most" financial group and Weigel 
Broadcasting, an American company. 
  In the past six months the "Most" group under Vladimir 
Gusinskiy proved to be an aggressive buyer on the mass media 
market. At present, it controls the SEGODNYA newspaper and the 
fourth television channel. What it lacks to have a complete 
spectrum is a popular radio station. "Most's" offer to "Ekho" 
looks as follows: an open credit line in exchange for 51 percent 
of the radio station's stock. This means that the station risks 
losing political, not only financial, independence. 
  Weigel Broadcasting is not a newcomer on the broadcasting 
market: After 25 years in business it owns eight television 
stations in the United States. According to the company's 
spokesmen, they are interested in "Ekho's" independence, because 
in the end it earns a good income. Weigel Broadcasting is ready 
to invest money not only in equipment: the 50 percent of stock 
it expects to get in exchange for its services opens up a way 
toward compromise-based management. 
  There is no unity inside "Ekho Moskvy" as to whose proposal 
it should accept. Editor-in-chief Sergey Korzun and journalists 
are inclined to forge a partnership with Weigel Broadcasting. 
Proposals by the "Most" group appear enticing to Yuriy 
Fedutinov, the station's commercial director. The fate of "Ekho 
Moskvy" will apparently be decided in mid-January at a general 
meeting of stockholders.

<F P=106> [Viktor Loshak report under the "In the Country" rubric: </F>
"Without Newspapers?"] 
  [Text] There has been no conflict more serious between the 
press and the authorities in this country than the one that 
erupted at the end of last year. Trade union leaders and 
editors in chief of central newspapers have advised the prime 
minister with coal miners-style bluntness and solidarity of 
their plans to cease issuing their publications unless Viktor 
Chernomyrdin changes his Decree No. 1233 concerning printers, 
paper industry workers, and mailmen. If the professional 
rebellion is in any way different from others that have already 
swept the country a number of times, it is that the newsmen have 
not said a single word about their own well-being. The only 
thing they request is: Do not give ill-conceived orders the 
most immediate consequences of which will tighten the noose 
around the entire press and thus the possibilities of tens and 
tens of millions of people to get printed information. 
  The letter signed by 25 editors in chief is unique also 
because newspapers of nearly the entire political spectrum have 
seen their interests converge at the point of death. Faced with 
the threat of a sixfold or higher rise in tariffs, even the most 
well-to-do ones have sensed the chill of nonexistence. As 
co-authors of a letter challenging the government, all of them 
have displayed a certain courage, but what I see as a desperate 
step was taken precisely by those who issue their publications 
using that same government's money. While rebuking or ignoring 
the rest, the government can simply cut off oxygen from its own 
newspapers. The restive ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI may be a case in 
point -- according to rumors, the plans are to close the 
newspaper and to set up a new, obedient publication in its stead. 
  Many people suspect that by driving tariffs through the roof 
with one hand and handing out subsidies with the other, the 
authorities are conducting a selection on the current newspaper 
market. All the more so because journalists have already 
swallowed without a wince the trial pill of the House of the 
Russian Press being taken away from them. 
  On the whole, nothing extraordinary has been under way: the 
redistribution taking place on the markets of authority and 
ownership cannot but trigger yet new battles on the information 
market. When it has finally dawned that to come to power in 
this country one needs simply to stick around in the television 
box as long as possible, the main battles broke out behind 
television programs' scenes. Given that the biggest bucks in 
the information business are made precisely behind those same 
scenes, neither strange edicts on the fourth channel, nor 
regular reshuffles of television chiefs, nor the fact that upon 
hearing cries "Thief!" no one rushed to fire or arrest anyone 
come as a surprise. 
  It is television that has drawn a line without any help from 
the press at an entire stage of the mass media's evolution. The 
celebration of the new political year was a propaganda fiasco of 
such scope that people usually do not get back to their former 
jobs in Federal Information Centers, ministries, or press 
services. However this matter might be resolved technically, 
there is nothing to be done with the public opinion any longer. 
I do not rule out a situation, however, where someone in the 
president's or the prime minister's entourage would start 
whispering: Former ministers are gone, and see what happened -- 
the press staged a mutiny. 
  If this is a mutiny, it is a mutiny of despair. It evolves 
against the backdrop of determining the results of subscription. 
By and large, the readers' audience is beginning to melt, if it 
is not already melting. There is only a total of three 
newspapers with 1 million or more subscribers, whereas as early 
as one year ago there were nearly 10 of them. 
  In fact, leaving the letter of the editors in chief 
unanswered, the authorities are simply drawing practical 
conclusions from their assessment of the press' performance on 
the eve of the party vote. For those who themselves are to bear 
most of the blame, the journalists' fault is both convenient and 
evident. A politician reproached MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI for having 
failed, along with other newspapers, to warn society about the 
threat of Zhirinovskiy. When the critic was shown a November 
issue, in which even the cover spoke about the threat, he at 
once "turned his coat:" Zhirinovskiy allegedly won because you 
advertised him, among other things. Having published their 
letter in 25 publications, the leaders of journalists unions and 
editors in chief have to a certain extent become hostages to the 
government. After all, people subscribed to IZVESTIYA, TRUD, 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and so forth, not to Chernomyrdin. It is 
the publications that should be held responsible. But to an 
even greater extent we are still hostages to the printers, 
mailmen, and paper industry workers. Publishers have already 
attributed the current fourfold (!) increase in prices to the 
government decree, against which the newsmen's letter is aimed. 
In the first half of last year, however, the publishers did not 
need any decree at all to effect an almost similar price rise. 
What if our letter will serve the interests of yet another 
state monopoly? Will the signature by the president of the 
publishers' association be a sufficient guarantee? 
  Indeed, government decree No. 1233 elicits both bewilderment 
and protest. But who can guarantee that subsidies instead will 
not raise even more questions? Will we be able to find common 
ground then? The statement is only a preamble, albeit an 
important one, to further solidarity actions.

  [Text] New York January 6 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Georgiy Mamedov who participated in the bilateral 
American- Russian political consultations in Washington, said 
the following on Thursday [6 January] in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS after their end. 
  "Our discussions," the deputy minister said, "were 
comprehensive and successful in all respects. Naturally, we 
concentrated on the programme of President Clinton's visit to 
Russia on the eve of the Russian-American summit to be held in 
Moscow between January 12 and 15." 
  According to Mamedov, the programme was agreed on all key 
issues. It can be said with certainty, he added, that 
preparations for the summit are progressing successfully. 
  Mamedov noted that the sides would focus on social and 
economic issues at the Moscow meeting and talks: progress of 
reforms in Russia and the economic situation in the world. 
  They will also discuss peace-making efforts, above all in 
such regions as Bosnia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The two sides 
attach much importance to strengthening the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. 
  This issue will occupy an important place on the agenda. As 
for Russia, it discusses this question both with Americans and 
other countries. 
  The summit programme also includes bilateral relations: 
environmental control, air service, etc.

<F P=106> [Report by Remigijus Barauskas: "A Temporary Illusion of </F>
Success in Combating the Mafia"] 
  [Text] After the adoption of the law on preventive 
detention, 58 groups of organized crime were identified and 
detained in Lithuania over a short time. "However, their 
removal has resulted in the annexation of their spheres of 
influence to other groups or to the establishment of new 
organizations. The fight against crime by police and legal 
measures alone produces a temporary illusion of success. If we 
do not eliminate the economic factors promoting crime, this 
fight may lose any sense," said Lithuanian Interior Minister 
Romasis Vaitekunas at a collegium meeting yesterday. 
  According to the minister, some leaders of criminal gangs in 
Vilnius, Kaunas, and Siauliai have emigrated and established 
contacts with international criminal organizations. According 
to Interpol reports, Lithuanian criminal groups have relations 
with those in the United States, Israel, Germany, Russia, and 
other countries. The list of criminals includes large-scale 
leaders of groups known both to Interpol and the police in 
different states. The key areas of Mafia activities are drug 
trafficking, trade in oil products and arms, money forgery, 
racketeering, prostitution, and gambling. 
  Resolute actions of the police in applying the law on 
preventive detention helped stabilize the criminal situation in 
the country. The rate of crime has dropped from 40 in early 1993 
to 10 percent by the end of the year. Criminal police have 
uncovered one-third of the crimes. However, the fact that the 
number of violent crimes has increased considerably is 
worrisome. In comparison with last year, the number of recorded 
murders with premeditation and attempts to murder have increased 
by 53 and 76 percent, respectively. The criminals' 
aggressiveness and violence is growing. Firearms were used 127 
times (or twice) more often than last year, and 124 explosions 
were registered this year. There are increasingly more attacks 
on policemen. In the opinion of the interior minister, trust in 
law enforcement institutions has risen, because the number of 
people informing the police about racketeers has increased 
five-fold. 
  R. Vaitekunas predicted that the level of crime should 
stabilize next year. Combating organized crime remains the key 
task of the police. This task should be facilitated by a law on 
control over criminal communities (or an anti-Mafia law) which 
is currently being drafted.

  [Text] The number of employees of the newly created Russian 
Federal Counterintelligence Service, including its territorial 
structures, will be approximately 75,000. In comparison with 
the Russian Ministry of Security, abolished in December, the 
number of personnel is being cut by 46 percent. Sergey 
Stepashin, first deputy head of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, reported this in an interview to INTERFAX. According 
to him, the new service will not have investigation and 
detention centers. It will not be fighting corruption, which is 
not characteristic of its functions. Such functions were 
formerly carried out by Ministry of Interior organs. The 
Lefortovo detention center where organizers of the 3-4 October 
events in Moscow are now being held is being transferred to the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. All these changes were approved 
in the course of today's meeting in Moscow between the leaders 
of the Federal Counterintelligence Service and President Boris 
Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [By KRIM-PRESS correspondent Sergey Oleynik for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The number of Russian 
counterintelligence officers will total 75,000 which is 46 per 
cent less than before the former Security Ministry was 
transformed into the Federal Counterintelligence Service, 
according to a spokesman of the service. 
  Aleksey Kondaurov told CRIME-PRESS on Thursday that all 
officers of the former Security Ministry will have to pass 
qualification tests before getting a new employment, however he 
denied that this would be a "personnel purge". 
  "If anyone is to be dismissed, this would be done only at 
his 
own request or in connection with retirement", he added. 
  The new provisions for the counterintelligence service, 
which 
were approved by the Russian president and to who it will 
directly report, entrust it with the struggle against all types 
of espionage - economic, political, military and scientific. 
  Besides, the service will fight terrorism and drug 
trafficking, according to Kondaurov who added that the service 
will no longer engage in activities alien to counterintelligence 
tasks. 
  The former Security Ministry anti-organised crime department 
was transferred to the Interior Ministry, while the 
investigation department became a part of the office of the 
Russian prosecutor general. The former KGB investigation prison 
in Lefortovo was also transferred to the Interior Ministry. 
  The service will consist of four major departments - 
counterintelligence, military counterintelligence, economic 
counterintelligence, terrorism and drug fighting, according to 
Kondaurov.

not read ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. That is the length of time that it 
has not been printed by Krasnoyarsk's "Ofset" Production and

  This is a graphic example of what may happen to other

enterprises. Krasnoyarsk newspapers have reprinted ahe Appeal

Russian Federation Government. 
  The editors of leading Krasnoyarsk and certain rayon 
newspapers, as well as the "Ofset" Publishing House, have signed

stop publishing during the first "week of parliament" -- 11

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Portnikov report under the "Ukraine" rubric: </F>
"Republic May Also Have Referendum, Not Only Elections. Leonid 
Kravchuk's New Year's Present"] 
  [Text] In his New Year address to Ukrainian citizens, 
Leonid Kravchuk unexpectedly broached the fairly unexpected idea 
of holding a referendum on the law on authority. The president 
explained that the law was designed to put an end to 
misunderstanding with regard to the separation of powers in 
Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk's initiative appears to be a logical 
continuation of the emerging confrontation between the president 
and the Ukrainian Supreme Council on the eve of the upcoming 
parliamentary, and later presidential, elections. While the 
parliamentarians have already put up with the ineluctability of 
having to run for reelection, and preparations for the 
parliamentary elections are in full swing, the Ukrainian 
president does not appear too enthusiastic about going through a 
similar process himself. The "party of authority" in Ukraine is 
unwilling to hold early presidential elections, either, because 
there is no plausible, serious alternative to Leonid Kravchuk 
just the same. Given the republic's difficult economic and 
political situation, however, it is far from certain that 
Kravchuk is set to achieve an easy victory at the early 
presidential elections. 
  Therefore, the ruling elite would like to insure itself 
against possible surprises, but this requires unconventional 
moves that will be somewhat reminiscent of the way events 
evolved in Russia: the vote on a new constitution was also 
proclaimed "an expression of confidence in Boris Yeltsin," hence 
the question of early presidential elections in Russia fell 
through by itself. The Ukrainian authorities, however, cannot 
submit a new constitution to a referendum. This is why they 
came up with the law on authority, which will boost presidential 
powers and may turn Ukraine into a presidential republic without 
making amendments to the country's fundamental law beforehand. 
Should the referendum be a success, one may interpret it as an 
expression of citizens' confidence in President Kravchuk and, 
hence, cancel the early presidential elections after the new 
deputy corps is already in place. 
  It is not yet clear how the president is going to hold the 
referendum. Or who will draw up the law on authority: the 
current parliament or a structure specially appointed for this 
purpose by the Ukrainian president, and whether the chiefs of 
the Ukrainian Supreme Council under its chairman, Ivan Plyushch, 
will be involved in the preparation of the new referendum. If 
the Supreme Council accepts President Kravchuk's initiative and 
calls the referendum on the law on authority simultaneously with 
parliamentary elections, it will, of course, have to draw up the 
law on its own, and then presidential powers will not be as 
sweeping as Leonid Kravchuk would wish. Even in this case, 
however, the adoption of the law on authority would 
automatically mean an expression of confidence in the president. 
According to some well-informed sources close to the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council's chiefs, Ivan Plyushch is unlikely to be 
willing to strike a deal with Leonid Kravchuk on the referendum, 
because the Ukrainian parliament speaker, as many other 
politicians in the republic, would probably like to seize the 
chance of early presidential elections simply to try his luck or 
to remind the public of himself as Leonid Kravchuk's possible 
successor, if not to win.

a Current Issue in a Democracy as Well"] 
  [Text] The resolution "On Military Counterespionage 
Service of the Security Service of Ukraine" has come into 
effect, by virtue of Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy's order. 
The Security Service has been entrusted with the 
counterespionage protection of the Armed Forces and other 
military units. The document specifies that the military 
counterespionage services shall effectively address defense 
problems, disclose and prevent espionage and sabotage activities 
in military units, as well as work out and implement measures to 
protect state secrets. 
  This way, the well-known special units, which were first 
introduced in the Russian Army on the eve of World War I, have 
outlived the Soviet Army, and have been transplanted into the 
reinstated military units of Ukraine. No matter where you go -- 
the fight against spies is always a current issue of any 
authorities.

  [Text] Ivan Yermakov, head of the Sevastopol 
administration who is running for Crimean presidency, thinks 
that Russia and Ukraine must guarantee the Crimea's security and 
territorial integrity. 
  "The Crimea needs a body, wielding real power, that would 
handle all military issues, a Security Council chaired by the 
Crimean president elected by popular vote," Yermakov told 
INTERFAX. 
  In his words, the stationing of new and movement of existing 
military units in the Crimea must be cleared with the Security 
Council. 
  Yermakov said that he wanted the Black Sea Fleet to be 
controlled by Russia, but it was up to the presidents of Russia 
and Ukraine to decide who "must show firmness, political will 
and not take heed of the noise made by various nationalistic 
groups." 
  He believes that the fleet must become a major element in 
the 
security system of the Crimea and CIS member states. 
  Yermakov said that Sevastopol, an integral part of the 
Crimean Republic, has been and will remain the main base of the 
Black Sea Fleet. 
  He called for a "civilized" solution of the Crimean problem 
and emphasized that "changing the borders at this stage may 
result in a war." 
  "Conditions, historic and political, must be right, but 
everybody knows now that economically the Crimea is linked with 
the Russian industry," the presidential candidate said. 
  He believes that Ukraine needs "to mature before it is 
prepared to give the Crimean back to Russia." Furthermore, 
Ukraine must become a full member of the CIS economic union. 
  "If Ukraine does not become a member of that union, I think 
that the Crimea can enter it on its own," Yermakov said. 
  The presidential elections will be held in the Crimea on 
January 16.

  [Text] Sevastopol -- Leonid Hrach, a candidate for the post 
of president of the Crimea from the Communist Party of the 
Crimea, met electors from the town of Sevastopol on 5 January. 
He subjected his rivals to harsh criticism, in particular 
Mykola Bahrov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, and also all 
former communists from the present power apparatus -- Leonid 
Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin. In the opinion of Leonid Hrach, 
they should be tried in accordance with Soviet laws for the 
collapse of the USSR. The leader of the Communist Party of the 
Crimea warned those present of the threat from Muslim countries, 
especially Turkey. "The aim of my policies, he noted, is to 
restore the USSR. For this the Crimea should enter the CIS 
independently -- this is the path of salvation for the 
peninsula. Its economic problems can only be resolved by 
getting large credits from Russia." 
  Leonid Hrach called on Communists to be vigilant as, in his 
opinion, the manipulation of votes is possible at the elections. 
Replying to questions from the hall, he was not able to explain 
what he had been engaged in during the last two years and why 
the Communist Party had lost prestige. Observers formed the 
opinion that in the event of the victory of Leonid Hrach at the 
elections, then a dictatorship of the proletariat may possibly 
not come, but a dictatorship of the Communist Party will be 
guaranteed.

<F P=106> [By Vladimir Plotnikov and Vadim Telichev from Crimea; from </F>
the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Plotnikov] In the new year there are more thorough 
structural changes in store for industry in Ukraine and 
particularly in Crimea. This is the case, for example, at the 
former "Foton" production association in Simferopol, which used 
to provide services for the defense sector but which has now 
become a commercial science and production firm and is rapidly 
increasing its output of nontraditional goods. Those goods 
include microwave ovens, large-screen TV sets, 55-channel 
satellite TV receivers, and antennae. They are cheaper than 
their foreign equivalents and can be bought not for dollars but 
for Ukrainian coupons. Structural reorganization is a means of 
salvation for many other enterprises in conditions when there 
are no raw materials, demand for traditional goods has fallen, 
and the energy crisis has become extremely acute. The Crimean 
Supreme Soviet decree on an open economy regime in the peninsula 
offers good scope for this kind of reorganization. This decree 
will encourage the participation of foreign partners and 
investors in the development of a modern production industry.

  [Excerpt] S. Shushkevich has described the upcoming 
official visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton as an important 
and positive event for Belarus. As S. Shushkevich said in an 
interview with the ZVYAZDA newspaper correspondent, one of the 
most important tasks at the Belarus-U.S. talks is to clarify 
positions on the basic strategic issues of our policy and, in 
particular, issues concerning the security of Belarus. "When 
Belarus implements its constitutional law on neutrality and 
nuclear-free status it would like to have guarantees for the 
preservation of its neutral status, such as those that at one 
time Finland had from the United States and the USSR," stressed 
S. Shushkevich. 
  Concerning B. Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" initiative, 
S. Shushkevich noted that he also considers it expedient to 
examine the official strategy of Belarus in creating in Central 
Europe a belt of neutral states with certain guarantees from the 
great states of the world. 
  Furthermore, S. Shushkevich considers that B. Clinton's 
visit 
to Minsk will encourage U.S. investment in its economy. [passage

  [Text] Russia should become a member of NATO before the 
states of Eastern Europe and Lithuania join this organization. 
This was stated by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
in an interview for a RIA correspondent. He said that such a 
step will help to avoid military-political polarization in 
Europe. Kebich believes that, once Russia has joined NATO, 
Belarus may also become a member of that bloc.

<F P=106> [Article by Semen Voronov: "Canny Little Bunny Was Jumping </F>
Near a Christmas Tree"] 
  [Text] On New Year's eve, Belarusian Prime Minister Kebich 
visited a children's sanatorium. While there, as reported by 
Lidiya Peresypkina, a BELINFORM correspondent, the prime 
minister managed to hold an interview with journalists. Of 
course, the prime topic of discussion was the recent CIS summit 
in Ashgabat which he attended. 
  At the Ashgabat meeting, said Mr. Kebich, I came to believe 
-- maybe for the first time -- that a good fate awaits us. Here 
is one example. We signed an agreement removing custom duties on 
assembly components in all CIS countries. This means that the 
price of finished products will be reduced by 30 percent all 
across the CIS. 
  It became clear at the meeting that everyone understood that 
cooperation is vital to all of us. After more than three hours 
of bilateral talks with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, all 
the prime ministers came to one conclusion -- agreements with 
Russia must be signed as soon as possible. 
  Asked what good and bad things Belarus experienced over the 
past year, Vyacheslav Kebich said our major success was that 
bloodshed on Belarusian territory was avoided. He spoke against 
further price increases and the deterioration of people's lives. 
Incidentally, the Belarusian prime minister thinks that it was 
the Ashgabat meeting that pushed CIS countries closer to a 
genuine economic union. Mr. Kebich is convinced that the common 
ruble zone will continue to exist. It is only together that 
former Soviet republics can stop their downfall. 
  So, why don't we begin believing in our good fate?

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich at a meeting </F>
with diplomatic corps in Minsk on 29 December] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots, ladies, gentlemen, colleagues! 
  Let me pass my most sincere greetings and wishes of 
prosperity and happiness to you and the entire diplomatic corps. 
I want to emphasize that I am extremely happy to have the 
chance to meet you and share opinions with you on various issues 
of bilateral relations and international problems. 
  I am grateful to you for the nice wishes and opinions that 
you have repeatedly voiced at meetings with me and other Council 
of Ministers representatives. 
  I sincerely hope that the spirit of mutual understanding, 
friendship, and personal sympathy will prevail in our relations. 
I am convinced that this will serve the interests of our states 
and nations. 
  Due to the nature of your work you are well-informed about 
the problems Belarus are experiencing. I do not want to conceal 
the fact that we are living through hard times -- critical 
processes in the economy are aggravating which has a negative 
impact on the sociopolitical sphere and causes negative reaction 
on the part of certain social groups. Many people have 
difficulties comprehending what is going on, and demand that the 
course of reform be abandoned. 
  We clearly see the seriousness of the current historic 
period 
and are doing our best to decently exit the situation. 
  Of course, the economy is not the only important factor. A 
radical reshaping of the political and administrative systems is 
under way that involves changes in mentality and ideology and 
thus, the entire system of personal and social values. 
  At the same time, everyday mentality fails to follow these 
processes, also because we have not formed a comprehensive 
theoretical footing for the latter. This causes frustration and 
dissatisfaction and optimistic thinking often gives way to 
pessimism. Doubts continue to grow regarding the authenticity 
of the path upon which the Republic has set out. Diametrically 
opposing opinions are voiced -- some suggest orienting toward 
the East, while others maintain that the key to resolving our 
problems lies in the West. 
  With regard to this, I would like to answer one question 
that 
disturbs me: Does Belarus has its own foreign policy? 
  Yes, we have such a policy and its essence is not seeking 
priorities from the so-called "class perspective." Its essence 
is to be driven solely by national-regional interests. 
  It is based on refraining from using force or 
threatening to use force. 
  As you know, the Republic of Belarus, having proclaimed 
independence and won statehood, declared a ban on possessing 
nuclear arms and ever since, has been consistently pursuing this 
policy on the international arena. 
  Thus, we were the first among the former USSR 
republics, and in general, among the world's nations, to 
initiate nuclear disarmament without putting forward any 
preconditions. 
  By doing this, we laid our own little brick into the common 
foundation for European and international security. At the same 
time, we are not expecting any gratitude from the world 
community. The main issue for us is trust, mutual 
understanding, and an opportunity for full-blooded international 
cooperation. 
  These principled approaches determine the primary directions 
of our foreign policy, based on our vision of world problems and 
ways to resolve them. This does not depend on conjuncture -- 
this is a result of our convictions and the political evaluation 
of the Republic's place and mission as a European state. This 
is a form of our participation in resolving global international 
problems. 
  We carefully examined the initiative voiced by NATO states 
on 
implementing a new concept of European security called 
"Partnership for Peace." I believe that these issues will be 
discussed in detail in the course of President Clinton's visit 
to Belarus. We are ready for this, and we will try to be 
reliable partners for our neighbors both in the East and the 
West. 
<H5>  On Domestic Situation </H5>
  I have already said that our domestic situation is 
complicated and contradictory. Its major peculiarity lies in 
the fact that proclaimed democratic values and goals have not 
received legislative footing. The lack of a precise scheme for 
the division of powers often becomes the source of instability 
and political opposition. Paradoxical situations arise when the 
sprouts of the market economy are treated with an iron hand of 
administrating, while the emerging entrepreneurship is fought as 
dissidence. I mean the notorious reports on corruption. 
  What happened? In my opinion, certain forces, intentionally 
or not, used data that lacked judicial evaluation to launch an 
attack on democracy. These groupings decided to review the 
process of democratic reform and reverse market changes. When 
left and right radicalisms merge, this may initiate mob rule 
which may block the Republic's path to the market, destroy 
social accord, and hamper the process of political changes in 
general. 
  Of course, all this should be submitted to an in-depth 
analysis, but many people have already understood that the 
government, just like the legislature, needs more reliable legal 
and constitutional protection and immunity against cheap 
populism and petty heroism. 
<H5>  A Couple of Words on Our Economy </H5>
  The socioeconomic development of Belarus has recently been 
accompanied by further exacerbation of critical phenomena, the 
shrinking of production and investments, inflation and 
deregulation of the consumer market. This has led to a 
deterioration in living standards. The main cause of the crisis 
is the destruction of the single economic space of the former 
USSR. However, there also exist domestic factors. 
  Due to well-known historic conditions, an abnormal 
structure of production has developed in the Republic, 
inadequate for the demands and purchasing power of our citizens. 
  The Belarusian economy is currently one of the most open 
economies. The Republic exports 19 percent of its products, 
importing 18 percent of consumer goods. For example, in 1992, 
Belarus imported 100 percent of natural gas, coal, steel pipes, 
cars, tractor trailers, wood processing machines, and so on. 
  Aside from this, high material and power outlays are the 
typical traits of the Belarusian economy. The situation was not 
that acute when the country received cheap raw materials, 
semimanufactures, and power resources from Russia and the other 
republics of the former USSR. Today, when prices for raw 
materials and power have reached the world level and the quality 
of Belarusian products does not meet international standards, 
further development of the structure of the economy granting 
competitiveness to just 3 percent of its products would lead to 
complete bankruptcy. 
  Thus, the primary task currently facing the state is 
global structural reshaping. We are trying to 
exercise maximum control over this process to alleviate 
inevitable accompanying hardships afflicting society. 
  With difficulty, so far, we have managed to achieve this. 
Belarus has the lowest rates of reduction in major economic 
indicators among all the CIS states with a similar socioeconomic 
structure, although due to understandable reasons prices for 
main power resources are five to 10 times higher in the Republic 
than in Russia. This is the principal factor determining the 
low exchange rate of the Belarusian "hare" as compared to the 
Russian ruble. 
  Local peculiarities aggravate the situation. Among these, we 
should first of all underline the demographic structure 
unfavorable to economic development -- pensioners and elderly 
represent a significant part of society. People from many 
regions of the former USSR have often preferred to retire in 
Belarus. 
  The second negative peculiarity is the unheard-of 
concentration of the former Soviet Army's units and the 
necessity to observe USSR's commitments in the field of 
disarmament. Belarus is strictly implementing these commitments. 
  Third, we are continuing an exhausting battle against the 
aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. 
  We are forced to direct huge financial resources to resolve 
these problems, complicating and retarding the progress of 
reform. However, we are steadily pursuing the course for 
privatizing state property, demonopolizing industries, and 
fundamentally reforming the credit and banking system. 
  We understand that unlike the deregulation of prices, these 
systematic institutional changes cannot be carried out 
overnight, even if the former enjoy sociopolitical acceptance on 
the part of the people. 
  Serious problems emerge on our way. The "invisible" hand of 
the market brings changes undesirable for society. This is 
demonstrated by the experience of many countries living through 
a transitional period. When prices are set free, the 
application of Western-type monetary methods is often 
inefficient and may bring opposite results. 
  The government has a concept as to how to resolve these 
problems. This concept is based on the sober evaluation of our 
potential and understanding of an active involvement of the 
state in realigning the economy. Interaction with Russia 
is the cornerstone of this concept. 
  You have probably noticed that the government needed civic 
courage, resoluteness, and untraditional thinking to take some 
of these measures. We have often had to conduct acute political 
battles, debate with our opponents, and break through the lack 
of understanding. We are absolutely positive that we took a 
correct line in stipulating an economic union within the CIS 
framework, a single ruble zone with Russia, and a coordinated 
customs legislation. This will give our people the possibility 
to live and work in a civilized manner. 
  To persuade the people, the government is forced to act as a 
political organization, and sometimes perform similar functions. 
It is not through coincidence that we are occasionally called a 
"team" or even a "party." With regard to this, I want to 
emphasize that we are carrying the burden of political 
responsibility for the fate of the nation. 
  In light of this, the social orientation of West European 
democratic and social-democratic parties seems most attractive 
to us. The virtues of these parties are widely known. They 
were the first to give a theoretical footing to building a 
society of class peace, took an active part in eliminating the 
postwar economic crisis in Europe, and substantially contributed 
to the building of the states of law. Their cooperation on the 
international arena has granted a lasting peace in Europe; 
onetime enemies have been actively cooperating; economic 
integration is being accompanied by a political one. 
  I believe that these achievements can be successfully 
applied 
on Belarusian soil after introducing appropriate corrections 
given the new historic conditions. 
  Speaking in the town of Mir a year ago, I formulated the 
government's economic and sociopolitical strategies. Ever 
since, nobody has come up with an alternative program oriented 
toward the interests of the people. This gives me confidence in 
the correctness of the chosen path. I am ready to cooperate 
with all the forces sharing these democratic and social values. 
  I hope for understanding and support from all political 
forces loyal to the ideas of the national renaissance of the 
Republic of Belarus. 
  I also count on your understanding and support. 
  Happy New Year! With all my heart I wish prosperity, peace, 
and well-being to your nations. 
  I am addressing all the Belarusian citizens and compatriots 
abroad with New Year greetings. I wish you good health, 
happiness, and success in work for the benefit of our native 
land.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Aron: "Belarusian Obligations for 1993 On </F>
Reduction of Conventional Weapons and Equipment Have Been 
Implemented"] 
  [Text] Colonel-General Pavel Kozlovskiy, Belarusian defense 
minister, has issued an order "On Results of Implementation of 
Treaties and Agreements on Disarmament and Reduction of 
Conventional Weapons and Equipment in 1993." The order says 
that the Republic of Belarus has implemented its obligations for 
1993 on the reduction of conventional weapons and equipment. 
Appropriate information and notifications have been submitted 
to all states-participants to international disarmament treaties 
and agreements on time and in a full volume. 
  In 1993, 44 foreign inspections visited military sites of 
the 
Defense Ministry. Belarusian military experts participated in 
eleven military inspections abroad. 
  All the foreign military inspections confirmed the 
implementation of regulations of the Treaty on Reduction of 
Conventional Weapons in Europe and the 1992 Vienna Agreement and 
noted a high professional level of the Belarusian military which 
accompanied them on their inspection visits. 
  Belarusian defense minister thanked Colonel I. Osif, deputy 
chairman of the National Agency for Control and Inspection, 
Colonels B. Zhukov and A. Orel, Colonel V. Khomenok, commander 
of armored units, and a range of officials, who accompanied the 
foreign military in their trial inspections on the territory of 
Belarus. 
  At the same time, the order says that some officials were 
not 
responsible in performing their duties. During a trial 
inspection conducted by the Spanish military at the Minsk High 
Military Command School, inspectors discovered one nonregistered 
armored personnel carrier [BTR-60] and one infantry fighting 
vehicle [BMP-1]; at repair factory No. 140, a nonregistered 
infantry fighting vehicle [BMP-1] was found, while one infantry 
fighting vehicle [BMP-1] was registered as BMP-2. At some 
military units, the inspecting military were admitted with time 
delays due to the irresponsibility of commanders, etc. In 
response to this, the Belarusian defense minister included 
appropriate remarks to the aforementioned order.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Dorovolskiy, leader of the United </F>
Democratic Party of Belarus, by Galina Dobrovolskaya; place and 
date not given: "Life Itself Will Force Us To Be Active"] 
  [Text] [Malakhovskaya] After taking a short stroll along 
the Minsk streets, one of my friends from Moscow said: "How 
bizarre it is to see such a drowsy and lethargic city." Do you 
agree with this? 
  [Dobrovolskiy] After my recent trip to Poland, I 
unexpectedly 
realized that not only is our people's life much worse, they 
also think in a different way. For example, they wouldn't move 
a finger to make their life any better. Poles, by contrast, 
seek to achieve Western living standards. 
  The effects of economic reforms in Poland are easily seen -- 
storeshelves are always full, and even low-paid workers can lead 
a decent life there. Our Republic found itself in a bind not 
only because of the ineptness of its government, but also 
because of people's apathy. In a society undergoing economic 
reforms, ordinary workers participate in changes. There will be 
no more tranquility -- one will have to work better to earn a 
good salary or simply to retain his workplace. 
  [Malakhovskaya] So we should adopt an American style of 
living. Is that correct? 
  [Dobrovolskiy] Mired in an old habit, we are waiting for 
someone to pass some good law and settle our problems. We must 
take the initiative and change our society, so that the 
government and parliament consist of reform-minded 
professionals. A famous saying has been borne out: People have 
leaders that they deserve. To change something in life, one 
should change himself in the first place. 
  [Malakhovskaya] What should we expect from the new year 
then? 
  [Dobrovolskiy] First of all, a shift in public sentiments. 
Life itself will force us to be more active. Our neighbors -- 
perhaps with the exception of Ukraine -- have left us far 
behind. If no resolute measures are undertaken, we will end up 
in limbo. The economic situation will worsen. God help us avert 
a collapse. We have long proposed creating a free banking zone 
in Belarus. This would allow us to finance Belarusian, Russian, 
and other enterprises. We should also try to ram our 
refrigerators, automobiles, tractors, and television sets into 
foreign markets.

  [Text] The deputies' association "Belarus" stands for the 
Republic's integration into the international community. 
However, it sees as its top priority the establishment of 
mutually beneficial relations with Belarusian neighbors, first 
of all, with Russia as well as Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, and 
Latvia. This was declared by the largest legislative faction at 
its meeting with a European Parliament delegation in charge of 
cooperation with CIS states headed by Magdalene (Hoe). In the 
words of Gennadiy Kozlov, "Belarus" acting coordinator, the 
faction is intensively working on strengthening integration with 
Russia proceeding from, as was emphasized, the sovereignty of 
the Belarusian state, and perceives Germany as the main partner 
in Europe.

<F P=106> [Comments by Petr Bryhadzin, deputy chairman of the Party of </F>
People's Accord Council, edited by Tatstsyana Lazowskaya: "The 
Legislature -- Mirror of Society"] 
  [Text] The results of the elections in Russia were not 
unexpected. We could foresee that slogans of Zhirinovskiy's 
party would be approved by poor people who comprise the majority 
of the Russian population -- some 70 percent. By the way, such 
populist ideas will always attract simple people even if they 
are pronounced by the devil itself. "Russia's Choice," however, 
has not received the votes it could receive because the 
elections had not been organized properly. In my opinion, they 
were let down by their self-assurance of being the only 
candidates to the new power organs. As for me, the situation in 
Russia is not tragical at all: The legislature's membership 
perfectly demonstrates the situation in the state. It is 
evident that the counterbalance of forces in the Russian Duma 
will spark heated debates. Meanwhile, the Russian president, 
who is authorized with great powers, will not allow the 
opposition forces to show their actual force. In addition, the 
State Duma will hardly affect the state policy of the Yeltsin 
team. 
  At the same time, we should not underestimate the elections 
in Russia. It is symbolic that Russian super-radicals received 
the majority of seats in the legislature. We should remember 
that such things could happen in Belarus as well. It seems 
likely that independent candidates of the Zhirinovskiy type -- 
at least four in number -- will appear. The victory of the 
Zhirinovskiy party will cause a chain reaction. This fact 
should be considered during the election campaign in Belarus. 
  As for the Party of People's Accord, we have got some 
electoral experience. We have nominated First Deputy Foreign 
Minister Tarazevich to the Belarusian Supreme Soviet in the 
Zhodino electoral district. However, the elections failed due 
to the fact that only 46 percent of the voters participated in 
them. In my opinion, a 50 percent voting limit should be 
annulled otherwise elections will never be held. 
  I cannot assess the report presented by People's Deputy 
Lukashenko. Indeed, corruption is eating our society from top 
to bottom. The facts revealed by Lukashenko were not surprising 
neither for politicians, nor for law enforcement officers who 
provided the deputy with this information. To my mind, Eduard 
Shirkovskiy, chairman of the Belarusian Committee for State 
Security, or the State Office of the Prosecutor, or at least the 
Supreme Soviet Control Chamber should have reported on this 
issue. Furthermore, in order to account for the accusations, the 
officials whose names are mentioned in this report should have 
secured access to these facts before they were brought to the 
Supreme Soviet deputies. We should learn to behave in a 
civilized manner. 
  I do not oppose the activities of this legislative 
commission. This commission should investigate the moral-ethical 
side of the issue, and coordinate its work with the activities 
of law enforcement bodies. Only law enforcement officers can 
assess and make conclusions on the issue.

  [Text] A new club, "Deputies for Reforms," has been 
recently registered with the Minsk City Executive Committee. 
The Russian elections have shown a real situation in society 
and possible scenarios of its development. It is obvious that 
the fledgling dictatorial tendencies must be resolutely opposed. 
One should not stand aside at a time when society is threatened 
with turmoil. The deputies' club will keep to the following 
principles in its activities: Rejection of violent actions, 
accord and equality of nationalities, intolerance to 
totalitarianism in all its manifestations, equality of all types 
of ownerships, including private ownership of land. 
  The first meeting of the deputies with common sense, 
concerned with the fate of their people, will take place on 5 
January.

  [Text] The Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova (ADPM), one 
of the most influential in the republic, has approved its roll 
of 106 candidates for the parliamentary elections on February 
27. The party's co-chairman, Aurel Talmatskiy, told INTERFAX 
that the roll will be submitted to the Central Election 
Commission within the next few days. 
  Among party foremen, the roll includes most current 
republican leaders such as Parliamentary Speaker Petr 
Luchinskiy, Prime Minister Andrei Sangeli, Vice Prime Ministers 
Nikolay Oleynik and Valentin Kunev, and other ministers. 
  Talmatskiy said most state officials included in the roll 
will go on vacations and resign starting January 10. "We have to 
do that in order to prevent our political opponents from 
accusing us of abuse of power," he pointed out. 
  According to Talmatskiy, the agrarians do not intend to bloc 
with any other political forces. However, he was quoted as 
saying that "such blocs might be created in the parliament." "A 
union with the republican and social democratic parties which 
stand up for Moldova's stronger statehood and independence is 
the most likely," he noted. 
  At the same time, Talmatskiy pointed out that both open and 
disguised supporters of unification with Romania such as the 
Christian Democratic Front of Moldova will be his party's main 
opponents. "I mean the Congress of Intelligentsia and some other 
political parties which emerged from the Popular Front," he 
explained. 
  Local political scientists believe that the ADPM has the 
best 
chances of winning the parliamentary elections.

  [Text] Today at about 1000 [0800 GMT] vicar Teofan 
Sinaitul and the priest Sofian, head of the Antim monastery in 
Bucharest, arrived in Tiraspol intending to visit those who are 
imprisoned here: Ilie Ilascu, Tudor Petrov Popa, Andrei Ivantoc, 
Petru Godiac, and Alexandru Lesco. The two church officials 
were sent by Teoctist, patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox 
Church, to deliver a pastoral letter through which the patriarch 
comforts and blesses the prisoners, as well as a medal on behalf 
of the Holy Synod. 
  According to a statement by Teofan Sinaitul broadcast by 
Radio Chisinau, after they had persisted for almost eight hours, 
the authorities of the self-styled Dniester Republic did not 
authorize their meeting. We hope that in a few days' or weeks' 
time, when the authorities see fit to allow it, we will be able 
to pray for a few moments together with the five prisoners, 
Teofan said among other things, according to our Chisinau 
correspondent, Mircea Dascaliuc.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Sergey Tereshchenko 
received Turkish Transport Minister Makhmet Kostepen yesterday. 
[passage omitted] 
  Makhmet Kostepen said Turkey is ready to begin to implement 
several of specific proposals. For instance, Turkey is ready to 
participate in the reconstruction of Kazakhstani airports and to 
install electronic equipment there. 
  Cooperation in the field of telecommunications is also very 
promising. In February, Turkey, together with France, will 
launch a satellite which will substantially broaden the volume 
of Turkey's telecommunications with America, Western Europe, 
Central Asia, and Kazakhstan. 
  The guest also expressed a wish that an additional air 
flight 
to Turkey be opened. 
  Sergey Tereshchenko, having expressed hope that cooperation 
between the two countries will facilitate the speedy development 
of joint marine transportation, put forward the idea of setting 
up a joint venture for carrying freight by sea because each year 
about 7-10 million metric tons of oil have to be transported 
south and west.

The meeting discusses the Economics Ministry's proposals for 
using this year's money. The fund's goal is to support with 
investments reforms aimed at creating a socially oriented market 
economy and raising its competitiveness. 
  The meeting decided to channel the abovementioned funds into 
constructing and commissioning priority spheres of the economy, 
such as the power industry, the oil extraction and gas industry, 
nonferrous metallurgy, and the production of consumer goods. 
The meeting also decided to conserve a number of construction 
sites which cannot bring an immediate profit. 
  When finalizing the Cabinet of Ministry's draft statute, the 
Economics Ministry, along with other ministries and departments, 
should take into consideration foreign investments which will be 
attracted with this purpose in mind.

  [Text] Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko today chaired a 
regular meeting of a group that was set up in accordance with a 
statute of President Nursultan Nazarbayev on raising 
responsibility of the state management body's officials over the 
state of discipline, public order, and security. It examined 
the issue of safe storage of weapons by the republican Armed 
Forces. As a check shows, more than 400 units of weapons were 
stolen or lost last year from military regiments. Among the 
weapons are 148 rifles and automatic machines [as received], 175 
revolvers, 46 grenade cup dischargers, and five machine-guns. A 
certain quantity of them have been returned. But still a large 
number of weapons are owned by criminals. Criminal cases have 
been initiated on all these facts. 
  The participants of the meeting strengthened the need for 
specifying a circle of people in the Armed Forces who will be 
held responsible for military arsenals. The session also 
discussed the aggravating criminal situation in Dzhambul Oblast. 
The level of crime solvency continues to worry us. Last year 
it did not exceed 52 percent. The Chu valley, with its hemp 
fields, has become a destabilizing factor. It has become a sort 
of a pilgrimage for drug addicts practically from all over the 
CIS. The session adopted recommendations aimed at radical 
improvement of the law enforcement bodies activities. It was 
decided to examine the issue of their realization over a period 
of four months.

  [Text] The situation remains exceedingly tense on Karabakh 
fronts. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army press 
service reported that after a brief lull in fighting at night, 
the Azerbaijani troops resumed their attacks today in the 
direction of Gadrut, Agdam, and Askeran under the cover of 
fierce artillery shelling of Karabakh's defensive positions. 
Having massed large forces on the front, the enemy is trying at 
all costs to breach Karabakh's positions in these sectors. 
  NKR Defense Army subunits are succeeding in halting the 
numerically superior Azerbaijani troops. Nevertheless, the 
Azerbaijanis moved forward in the southern sector on the evening 
of 5 January. 
  The battles are also continuing with alternating success in 
the north, near Matagis in Mardakertskiy Rayon, where in recent 
days the Karabakh forces have managed to push back the enemy to 
its initial positions. 
  The battles were still continuing on all the aforementioned 
sectors at 1100 today. Both sides are suffering losses. 
  Information gathered from radio interception indicate that 
during the attacks the Azerbaijanis used assault detachments of 
foreign mercenaries, most of them from the CIS countries.

  [Text] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, in a letter sent to 
IMF Executive Director Michel Camdessou, has asked for easing 
the terms of a loan to Armenia from the IMF's stabilization fund 
intended for newly-independent states. 
  IF Note: The IMF says the loan is being delayed because of 
regional instability and fears that the funds can be used for 
non-peaceful purposes. 
  The president says Armenia is not a party in the conflict 
and 
nor is it recognized as such by the international community. He 
pledged Yerevan's commitment to establishing peace in the region. 
  Economics Minister Armen Yegiazaryan and Vice Foreign 
Minister Jirair Liparityan are due to go to Washington for a new 
round of talks with IMF officials to discuss the aid issue and 
the situation in Armenia. 
  In the meantime, the local currency, the dram, plummeted by 
30 to 40 points in Tuesday's sale. The dollar soared up to 
130-140 drams on the black market on Wednesday and 1,000 rubles 
fetched 70-75 drams. 
  Local experts say the setback follows government 
non-intervention in currency markets in the first days of the 
new year, a shrinkage in commodity supply, and the indexing of 
pay and incomes effective from January 1.

  [Text] Baku, JANUARY 6 (TURAN) -- Azerbaijani Cabinet 
passed a resolution concerning "Enlistment of foreign 
investments to oil industry". 
  The news centre of the government says that this resolution 
will enable to draw the attention to the development of oil and 
gas fields, to use foreign investments, labour and technical 
reserves more effective. 
  The resolution includes also the instructions of the SOCAR 
[National Petroleum Corporation of Azerbaijan]. SOCAR comes out 
for speeding up the talks with foreign companies on joint 
development of "Azeri" and "Chirag" oil-fields and to work out 
the draft of the agreement meeting the interests of Azerbaijan. 
  As the republic needs more natural gas, SOCAR with the 
assistance of American company "Pennzoil" intends to speed up 
installing of gas compression stations and building of sea 
gas-pipe, to start gas transportation from "Guneshli" field 
since the first quarter of 1994. 
  As TURAN agency was told by the sources close to the 
government, the draft of the resolution has been prepared by the 
President of SOCAR Natig Aliyev and was presented to the 
Prime-Minster Guseynov. 
  Judging by the context of the resolution, a group of experts 
led by Manaf Manafov does not intend to conduct talks with the 
consortium of oil companies any more. 
  Earlier SOCAR rejected the draft of the agreement prepared 
by 
this group as it did not meet the interests of Azerbaijan. 
There have been also some statements in press concerning the 
attempt of Manafov (the citizen of Slovakia) to get bribe from 
the members of the consortium in exchange for favourable 
conditions in the contract. 
  So, a new draft of the agreement will be of more severe 
character for foreign party. 
  The consortium of oil foreign companies was created in 
summer 
1993. It includes of such companies as AMOCO, BP-Statoil, 
Pennzoil, Unical, Turkish Petroleum Corporation. 
  At first only Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oil-fields have 
been 
involved into the process of exploration and development with 
total 1.5 billion tonnes of oil. 
  Autumn 1993 Guneshli oil-field was withdrawn from the 
project, Russian joint stock company "Lukoil" was included in 
the consortium.

today. Our correspondent Gulsafa Ahmedova reports: 
  [Ahmedova] Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Afiaddin 
Dzhalilov chaired the National Assembly session. 
  Though the bill on martial law was endorsed [as the basis 
for 
further debate] at its first reading at one of the previous 
session of the National Assembly, in view of proposals that have 
been made, it was recommitted to the relevant commission for 
amendments. 
  Metleb Mutallimov, chairman of the commission, submitted the 
new version of the bill to the parliamentarians. A new debate 
began. Its importance for the republic that is living under war 
conditions was noted.

bill on border guards, briefed the National Assembly about the 
bill. The parliamentarians put forward a number of interesting 
proposals during the debate. The bill was then put to a vote

vice-chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, Afiaddin 
Dzhalilov, received a delegation from the Ardebil province of 
Iran headed by the Vice- Governor 'Ali Akbar Iskanderi. The

Azerbaijan passed a decree on the creation of the free trade 
zone in this sector of the border. However, the opening of the

  [Text] Azerbaijan's Vice-Premier Abbas Abbasov and a 
delegation from the Iranian province of Ardebil discussed in 
Baku on Wednesday [5 January] ways of opening bazaars along the 
common border. 
  Abbasov reported that his government had drafted a plan on 
joint bazaars, and the republican leadership had been doing all 
it could to open such markets. 
  The project provides for stimulating the delivery of food 
and 
other prime necessity items to Azerbaijan from Iran. There will 
be primarily barter trade to keep Azerbaijan's currency reserves 
intact. Proceeds from market sales will be exempted from taxes. 
  Abbasov spoke highly of Iran's humanitarian relief to 
Azerbaijani refugees and welcomed Iran's proposal to set up a 
chain of Iranian shops in Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Experts in the local administration department of 
the Russian president called on Boris Yeltsin to set up a 
commission which would bring the constitutions of republics 
incorporated in Russia in line with the new Fundamental Law of 
the Russian Federation, the president's chief of staff Nikolay 
Medvedev told INTERFAX. 
  In his words, the experts found that numerous provisions of 
the recently adopted constitutions of Tatarstan, Bashkortostan 
and Tuva were inconsistent with Russia's Constitution. Twelve 
other republics, he said, still have old constitutions which are 
also inconsistent with the new Constitution of the Russian 
Federation. In particular, by its constitution Mordovia is a 
Soviet Socialist Republic. 
  Medvedev placed special emphasis on the fact that five newly 
established republics, Adygey, Altai, Ingushetia, 
Karachayevo-Cherkessia and Khakasia, do not have their own 
constitutions. The presidential chief of staff emphasized that, 
according to Article 72 of the Russian Constitution, the Russian 
Federation and its constituent parts would establish general 
principles of organizing systems of state authority and local 
government bodies. In numerous republics elections to the 
republican and local legislatures will be held shortly. In this 
light, the constitutions of the republics must as soon as 
possible be brought in line with the Fundamental Law of the 
Russian Federation.

  INTERFAX correspondents report that the official Groznyy 
accused Russia of unwillingness to quit the gendarme approach, 
as well as the policy of threats and intimidation. 
  The Chechen Republic believes that the date of March 13 is 
nothing else than a new deadline for the existence of the 
Chechen Republic to be possibly followed by punishment of the 
"obstinate".

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1013 GMT on 6 January broadcasts its "Documentary on the Air" 
program. During an 11-minute report, correspondent Tatiana 
Ulyanova gives brief details about the Republic of 
Kabardino-Balkar and introduces its president, Valeriy 
Mukhamedovich Kokov, who is interviewed by the program's 
presenter. 
  Asked whether he has established a hard-line dictatorship in 
the republic, Kokov replies: "I would not like to say that a 
hard-line dictatorship has been established on the territory of 
Kabardino-Balkar, but I can assert something else. We are in 
favor of discipline and order. It is for that reason that we 
take every measure to be in line with the both the political and 
economic changes that are occurring in the world, in good time 
and without excesses." 
  The relative calm in the republic is explained by the ways 
and wisdom of the republic's peoples. "They demonstrated this," 
says Kokov, "in the elections that took place recently. They 
assessed the situation in a fairly wise manner and, in spite of 
all the efforts of the political leaders to divide society into 
a minimum of two camps, the people of Kabardino-Balkar gave 
two-thirds of the votes in favor of stopping the further 
disintegration of our fatherland, for law and order, that is, in 
support of the constitution. What is more, the people of 
Kabardino-Balkar elected a new parliament in accordance with the 
new constitution of the Russian Federation." 
  Kokov then explains that he is giving this interview in the 
interval in the session. Kokov stresses that Kabardino-Balkar 
has exerted every effort to achieve a settlement in the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict, and is opposed to revenge actions in 
such conflicts.

measures to improve the activities of local executive bodies of 
power. 
  The staff of the administration head, which will exist in 
parallel with the local government, is to be cut by 20 percent. 
  The similar two-level executive structure was first created 
in 1992 by the former governor of the Sverdlovsk Region Eduard 
Rossel, who was dismissed by Yeltsin's decree. Now Rossel is 
the president of the Association of Economic Interaction of the 
Ural Region. He is also elected deputy to the new Russian 
Parliament.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Dolmatov: "Emergency Measures Introduced </F>
To Combat Crime"] 
  [Text] Makhachkala -- Last December the criminal 
statistics reached an alarming record: Over the past three 
years there had been 57 political murders in Dagestan, which is 
the highest indicator in Russia. It is not ruled out that in 
connection with the forthcoming parliamentary elections in a few 
months' time the wave of terror in the republic could rise even 
higher -- some political adversaries could settle accounts with 
the aid of weapons.... 
  Street hooliganism and thefts have become everyday 
occurrences in the life of Makhachkala and none of the city's 
inhabitants has felt safe. That is why the republic's 
leadership has deemed it necessary to take emergency measures to 
combat crime. From the first days of the New Year militia 
patrols have received the right to check the documents of all 
citizens and to search all vehicles. Those who have come to 
Makhachkala for no specific purpose can be expelled from the 
city within 24 hours. The special regime has been introduced 
for six months, and time will tell whether it is extended. 
  According to Magomed Magomedov, the head of the city 
administration, and Gadzhimagomed Gadzhimagomedov, chief of the 
internal affairs main administration, the militia has embarked 
on the special regime program in a state of full combat 
readiness. Reinforced detachments of internal affairs main 
administration staffers are serving at stations, markets, 
hotels, and airports. They have already made a "haul": Several 
owners of unregistered weapons have been arrested. 
  Understandably, the measures which have been adopted have 
been greeted with mixed feelings by the city's inhabitants: It 
is unpleasant for anyone to be subjected to total checks and to 
get involved in roundups, on the other hand nor could they 
tolerate the criminal anarchy. Indeed, the experience of the 
emergency situation in Moscow has shown that it is usually only 
the small "minnows" who get caught in the nets of such street 
checks, the big "sharks" are seldom caught without painstaking 
searching and investigation work. 
  However that may be, it is not out of the question that the 
Makhachkala experiment will be a positive or negative example to 
other cities, where crime is also rampant. In January it will 
already be clear whether it has given a good account of itself.

  [Text] President Yeltsin has not signed a cabinet reform 
decree yet, and, as one of his aides told Interfax on Thursday 
[6 January], claims about possible cabinet reshuffles are 
premature. 
  More than that, he added, the decree makes no mention of 
personal government appointments. A week after the document is 
signed and the first session of the Federal Assembly is held, 
Yeltsin is to ask Chernomyrdin to submit the list of deputy 
prime ministers for approval. 
  The prime minister intends to have four assistants, two of 
them first deputies. Even today government sources name with 
certainty Gaydar and Soskovets as candidates to the posts of 
first deputies. 
  Earlier, a well-placed source reported to Interfax that the 
president returned the decree for more work on it. On receiving 
the draft shortly before the new year, Yeltsin has discussed it 
in detail with Chernomyrdin and some other senior officials. 
  After studying it carefully, he has requested clarification 
on several important issues. 
  Observers regard as virtually decided the resignation of the 
current Deputy Prime Ministers Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey 
Shakhray. They also believe that Deputy Prime Ministers Yuriy 
Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha will step down, too. As for 
Anatoliy Chubays, it is not yet clear whether he will leave the 
government altogether or will stay as Chairman of the State 
Property Committee but step down as deputy prime minister. 
  A senior presidential administration official has confirmed 
that Shakhray will most likely leave the cabinet. In his words, 
Shakhray is engaged "in splintering activity, aimed at 
heightening confrontation even before the opening session of the 
Duma." 
  In saying that, the official referred to a "meeting, 
initiated by Shakhray" to bring together Duma members, elected 
from one-mandate constituencies in republics and other 
autonomies (the program of the Russian Unity and Concord Party, 
which is led by Shakhray, is popular among a significant part of 
parliamentarians from across the Russian Federation). 
  After a speech by Shakhray at that meeting, representatives 
of Tuva, Yakutiya, Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, Mari-El, Kabardino- 
Balkaria, Dagestan, Ingushetia, North Ossetia, Chuvashia, and 
other autonomies announced the formation of a parliamentary 
group and voiced their intention to nominate Shakhray to the 
post of Duma Speaker. In a document adopted at the meeting, its 
participants declared that their goal is to implement the 
provisions of the Federative Treaty. They demanded to elevate 
their group's status to that of a faction so that they can have 
equal rights in forming Duma structures.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- Russian Deputy Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said he did not know if he would 
remain in the government after a new cabinet reshuffle. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Shokhin said 
that 
a draft decree on the reorganisation of the government has been 
seen only by two people -- President Boris Yeltsin himself and 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. "Neither I, nor other 
deputy prime ministers to whom I have spoken have not been 
involved in the work on a new structure of the government." 
  He pointed out that "this is not the best variant of 
reorganisation when deputy prime ministers are excluded from 
preparatory work." 
  Shoknin said that according to newspapers the number of 
federal ministers will be reduced and some state committees will 
be reorganised into ministries or other federal services. 
  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said earlier 
today 
that the upcoming cabinet reshuffle will considerably reduce the 
number of ministers in the Federal Government. He said that 
"the number of ministers will be reduced sharply. There will be 
not more than 30 of them" in the government. He vowed that "the 
reduction will not hamper the government's work, but rather make 
it more efficient." 
  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko said that "a 
decree on the reorganisation of the government will be signed by 
the president either today or tomorrow." 
  Speaking about his future, Shokhin said that if "the foreign 
economic bloc of the government 'dissolves' in the economic one, 
I will have to go to the State Duma" where he hopes to head its 
Foreign Affairs Committee, provided it will also handle foreign 
economic issues and CIS problems. "Though I have some other 
variants as well," he added. 
  He admitted that if Boris Fedorov is chosen to handle 
foreign 
economic issues in the government "it will be easier for me to 
express my politicised point of view on what he will be doing 
from the parliament rostrum."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: By Andrey </F>
Pershin, Andrey Petrovsky, and Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed Yuriy 
Baturin his national security aide Thursday, the president's 
press service reports. 
  Baturin, 44, Dr.Sc.(Law), a graduate of the Moscow Physic- 
Technical Institute, the Moscow Law Institute and the School of 
Journalism of Moscow University, has been the president's legal 
aide. 
  The introduction of the new position is in line with the 
Constitution, which calls for a strong presidency, the 
president's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told 
Interfax's Vyacheslav Terekhov. 
  Furthermore, this is a natural continuation of the personnel 
policy in the post-Soviet period. Kostikov placed special 
emphasis on the fact that national security would be the 
responsibility of a civilian. 
  IF Note: According to a reliable source, Baturin was an 
adviser to Georgiy Shakhnazarov, an assistant to ex-USSR 
President Mikhail Gorbachev on foreign policy matters. Baturin 
was instrumental in drafting Yeltsin's key decisions last summer 
and autumn. In the opinion of a number of experts, he took part 
in working out in September of 1993 the presidential decree to 
dissolve the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies 
and schedule new parliamentary elections. 
  On the threshold of the opening session of a new parliament, 
the president has taken a number of decisions concerning his 
close aides. On Tuesday, he decreed relieving Sergey Yushenkov, 
Mikhail Mityukov, Mikhail Poltoranin, and Ekaterina Lakhova of 
their duties because of their future parliamentary work. This 
has been reported by the president's information service. 
  Mityukov has up until now led the Presidential Committee on 
Legislative Initiatives. Poltoranin has been in charge of the 
Federal Information Center, Yushenkov has been Poltoranin's 
first deputy, and Lakhova has been a presidential adviser. 
  By yet another decree, Yeltsin has dismissed his envoy to 
the 
Maritime Territory, Butov. 
  Earlier, he sacked two advisers -- Sergey Stankevich (on 
political affairs) and Aleksey Yablokov (on environmental 
problems).

  [Text] Yuriy Baturin, 44, who was appointed Russian 
president's national security aide on January 6, told Interfax's 
Vyacheslav Terekhov that he was taken by surprise. "The 
presidential telephone buzzed. I took the receiver. Boris 
Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) says that he came to a conclusion that he 
needs a national security aide and that I should be that aide. 
I had a second to think it over." 
  In Baturin's words, he understood that "it would be 
inappropriate to refuse or ask questions. ... Not because he 
(Yeltsin) was harsh or anything but I felt he really needed it." 
  Baturin said that he had a first brief talk with the 
president about his new functions Thursday and "we'll have a 
more detailed conversation probably two or three days after the 
holidays (Russian Orthodox Christmas). 
  "I will be coordinating the activities of special services 
and supervision and decision making on everyday matters which 
must not encumber the president," Baturin explained. 
  He said that, in addition to foreign intelligence, services 
such as government communication, border guards and 
counterintelligence "which brings about the largest number of 
problems daily" report to the president. 
  Unlike the foreign intelligence which must present a report 
to the president once a week, there is no telling when a 
decision on counterintelligence will have to be made. "The 
president entrusts his national security aide with making a 
decision jointly with the chiefs of these services. I should 
naturally report to the president," Baturin said. 
  He will brief Yeltsin on the situation in general terms and 
report strategic issues on which the president alone has the 
right to make a decision. 
  Unlike the national Security Council which is a consultative 
body, the national security aide "will have to do business with 
special services daily." 
  Baturin said that a concept of national security existed 
which covered the activities of special services and defined the 
kinds of political and other activities which might harm 
Russia's national interests. 
  He told Interfax that following his appointment he had a 
talk 
with chiefs of the Federal Counterintelligence Service at their 
invitation. "Their attitude (towards establishing the position 
of a presidential national security aide) was very positive. 
They view this as an essentially new approach to security 
matters. We had a very good, productive, meaningful talk," 
Baturin said.

  [Text] Russian Vice-Premier Sergey Shakhray told an 
Interfax interviewer on Thursday that there is a plan to 
re-subordinate the State Committee for Federation Affairs and 
Nationalities he leads to the presidential administration. 
  Commenting on the project, he suggested that such a move 
would make the committee less effective. He said the committee 
could be more productive under the government's command. But 
within the presidential administration it would turn into a 
secondary department. He voiced conviction that the plan had 
been devised because of his personality and re-emphasized the 
need for leading the committee by a vice-premier, as usual. 
Otherwise, in his words, it is impossible to make the finance 
and other ministries and departments turn their attention to 
ethnic relations and regional problems. However, he added, 
"there is every indication that a different decision has been 
taken." 
  He believes that there must be a body to work out political 
recommendations for the president on ethnic and regional 
policies. As for the federation committee, it should implement 
presidential and government decisions in this sphere.

  [Text] Sources in presidential circles reported to Interfax 
that a new structure to be in charge of ties with constituent 
members is supposed to be created in the government currently 
under reorganization. Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov is expected to 
head it. 
  The new structural body is to be created on the basis of the 
State committee on the Federation and nationalities and the 
unification of several other structures. 
  The sources indicated that the present State committee on 
the 
Federation would be withdrawn from the influence of the Party of 
Russian Unity and Concord [PRUC] headed by the vice premier and 
leader of the state committee Sergey Shakhray. 
  Ramazan Abdulatipov, another prominent functionary of the 
PRUC, works as deputy chairman of the State committee on the 
Federation. PRUC member Aleksandr Kotenkov heads one of the 
major structural branches of the committee.

<F P=106> [Kirill Varov report: "Shumeyko Remains a Favorite"] </F>
  [Text] Among the outgoing vice premiers in the government 
undergoing reformation Vladimir Shumeyko, who is considered by 
many a potential candidate in the future presidential elections, 
may receive the best possible "employment." It is known that 
Vladimir Filippovich does not intend to renounce the honor of 
running for the post of speaker of the upper parliament chamber 
-- the Federation Council -- if his candidacy is proposed by the 
president. It is another matter whether he has any real chances 
of getting a vote of confidence from his colleagues in the 
chamber. 
  The lineup of forces in the Federation Council appears to be 
far more enigmatic than in the State Duma, where partisan colors 
are much brighter and more definitive. In the Federation 
Council, on the other hand, according to preliminary estimates, 
Russia's Choice has six mandates, the communists about 12, while 
the bulk of the "senators," including almost 140 people, is not 
affiliated with any movement or bloc. Or rather they belong to 
the party of Russian bureaucracy, being officials of various 
ranks, and therefore it is quite natural that the great 
communicator Shumeyko, deprived of apparent extreme 
characteristics, has good chances of coming to terms with his 
colleagues in the vast Russian apparatus. Although, to be sure, 
there are various options....

  [Text] Lately we have been celebrating one holiday after 
another, but the complex political situation in Russia and the 
numerous uncertainties over how the Federal Assembly and State 
Duma will operate are preoccupying us very much. At the moment 
all parties and associations are declaring their positions and 
suggesting ways of making the work of the legislative body more 
constructive before the day the Federal Assembly holds its first 
sitting. We share these hopes too. This is what was discussed 
today at a press conference held by the leaders of the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord. The press conference was attended by 
Olga Vasilenko. 
  She will tell us about the position held by this party, 
whose 
leader is Sergey Shakhray. Over to you. 
  [Vasilenko] The aim of this party's deputies is to revive 
confidence in parliament, in the law, and to prevent a 
repetition of the confrontation between the legislative and 
executive branches. The State Duma's work must be based on 
equality of all its deputies, regardless of how they were 
elected -- from party lists or single- seat constituencies. In 
this connection, the representatives of the Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord believe that one of the speaker's deputies -- 
of whom there should be no more than two -- must definitely be 
nominated from deputies who were elected from single- seat 
constituencies. Furthermore, there should be a separate vote on 
each candidate, not on a package as is being proposed at the 
moment -- and the votes must be secret. 
  The party announces that it is urgently requesting all 
deputies to agree that there should be no live relays from 
sessions of the State Duma. This is because there is a tendency 
for certain personalities to show off before the country 
whenever they are at the microphone and this undermines the 
parliament's professional reputation. All these points are made 
in the party's statement. 
  Journalists were also given a list of certain legislative 
initiatives which the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, as this 
party is known for short, is proposing. I wish to draw your 
attention to the fact that this party proposes that there should 
be a law on state support for the periodical press. As you 
know, this has now become a very pressing subject. It is also 
proposing a draft treaty on a confederation of states belonging 
to the CIS. 
  Among the answers to questions raised by journalists I think 
it would interesting to hear what Shakhray, who is currently a 
member of the government, had to say about his personal future 
and about his relationship with the president in this respect. 
Here is what he said. 
  [Begin recording] [Shakhray] However the question is 
decided, 
I consider the question of Shakhray's personal membership or 
non- membership of the government as a political side issue. 
Irrespective of how this question is decided, I shall not get 
hysterical or start shouting anything against the president or 
the government. Unfortunately I know this kitchen too well to 
behave in such a childish way. 
  [Vasilenko] Sergey Mikhaylovich, what do you think the 
Duma's 
first day will be like? 
  [Shakhray] I think the first day will be quite a calm one. 
  [Vasilenko] In spite of the pronouncements by certain 
politicians and deputies who are saying that all sorts of 
commissions of inquiry should be set up? 
  [Shakhray] Commissions will be set up. However, one should 
remember that the new Constitution does not allocate parliament 
any supervisory functions. So, these will be commissions for 
the preparation of parliamentary hearings on various questions, 
on parliament's rights. I have no doubt that there will be very 
many of these commissions on parliamentary hearings. 
  [Vasilenko] You spoke of your intention to stand for the 
Duma chairmanship. 
  [Shakhray] I rated my chances as 50-50. Remember that 
seven of the eight leaders of political associations -- 
Zhirinovskiy, Gaydar, Yavlinskiy and the others [chuckles] -- 
have agreed that Shakhray should not be allowed to become 
speaker. This reduces my chances, of course, but I don't think 
it ends them altogether, because work is continuing. I am ready 
to discuss this question, the question of my speakership, as a 
package with all deputies' associations, including political, 
territorial, and independent ones, and to seek a solution. [end 
recording] 
  There was a question about criticism of Shakhray for running 
a separate election campaign from Russia's Choice. Here is what 
Sergey Mikhaylovich thinks about this. 
  [Begin Shakhray recording] There are two reasons for the 
percentage won by Russia's Choice. The first reason is the 
shock economic policy which created the social base for 
Zhirinovskiy and his ilk. The second reason is the 
unprofessional work with the mass media during the preparatory 
campaign. All other political associations -- those of 
Shakhray, Yavlinskiy, and some others -- were denied access. 
Only three of them -- Russia's Choice, the Communists, and 
Zhirinovskiy -- were allowed screen time. Furthermore, they 
tried to use the Communists and Zhirinovskiy as a means of 
intimidating the electorate, by showing them how bad the 
alternative to themselves would be. But this attempt to 
discredit them did not work. It only succeeded in giving them 
more publicity. [end recording] 
  Naturally the journalists asked how the votes would be 
apportioned in the State Duma. 
  [Begin Shakhray recording] I think all coalitions in the 
Duma will be formed in accordance with each specific question 
being debated. For better or for worse, there won't be any 
formally organized, block-voting coalitions in the Duma. But, 
whenever these questions have come up, I have always called on 
people to make a comparison between the present corps of 
deputies, with all its shortcomings, and the corps of deputies 
in the former Russian Supreme Soviet. According to Vorotnikov, 
who was leader of the Russian Federation during that period, 
democrats had 22 percent of the seats in that parliament. Now 
there are more of them, although they are still less than half. 
[chuckles] In other words, some progress has been made, in 
spite of everything. [end recording] 
  To conclude, let me say that Sergey Shakhray was, as always, 
calm, confident, laconic and -- judging by everything -- very 
constructively disposed towards his return to legislative work.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 6 (AFP) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin will seek a vote of confidence from the Duma, or 
lower house of parliament, when it meets next Tuesday [11 
January], Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray said Thursday. 
  He told reporters that the move "would help eliminate any 
misunderstanding between the government and the deputies." 
  Shakhray added that the 24 deputies belonging to his party, 
the Russia Unity and Accord Party that ran against the 
government-backed Russia's Choice party during the recent 
legislative elections, would give Chernomyrdin their vote of 
confidence. 
  He said that he expected a government reshuffle planned by 
President Boris Yeltsin to be a source of tension between the 
Kremlin and parliament, which has little say in the matter. 
  Shakhray, who may be targeted by the reshuffle according to 
local press reports, said he would not react "hysterically" if 
that were the case. 
  He said he plans to seek the presidency of the Duma despite 
the clear opposition of many of the political parties.

  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The two chambers of 
Russia's new parliament called the Federal Assembly will hold 
separate meetings on January 11, and not a joint meeting as 
planned earlier, informed sources told ITAR-TASS. 
  The upper chamber, the Federation Council will meet at 10.00 
Moscow time in the building of the former house of the press at 
25, Bolhsaya Dmitrovka. 
  The lower chamber - the State Duma -- will convene at 36 
Novy 
Arbat Street, the building which used to house the COMECON 
[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] headquarters and then 
the Moscow mayor's office. 
  In accordance with the constitution of the Russian 
Federation, the first meeting of the upper chamber will be 
opened by the president. The constitution does not provide for 
a joint opening session of the two chambers of the Federal 
Assembly. They can meet in a joint session to hear messages 
from the president and the Constitutional Court of the Russian 
Federation, or speeches by the leaders of foreign countries, as 
well as to attend the ceremony in which the president is sworn 
in.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "The Government Can Be </F>
Congratulated on Its New Home. But What of the New Russian 
Parliament?"] 
  [Text] Four days remain until the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly starts its work. It seems that this uncommon 
event in the country's life will be marked by the last-minute 
rush which is traditional for projects due for completion. In 
the new parliament's press center we were told that the venue 
for the first session is still unclear: either the Kremlin or 
the building which until the well-known events belonged to 
mayor's office. There is also total obscurity in respect of the 
standing orders. There is no question of agreed candidacies for 
the speaker and his deputies -- which, however, is not a drama 
in itself. We have been told by the Central Electoral 
Commission that four days before the State Duma begins its work 
the lists of deputies from parties and associations are still 
being sorted out. 
  Objectively speaking, the procedure for finishing such an 
important "project due for completion" has been messed up by the 
holidays, and there is also the effect of the "unraveling 
government" -- part of it has gone to apartments at the White 
House, and part has resigned in connection with the reform of 
government structures. The telephones -- not to mention 
continuity -- have been cut off.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 January -- A Union of Communist Parties 
(Roskomsoyuz) ["Russian Communist Union"] has, in effect, come 
into being in Russia. This statement was made to journalists 
today by Aleksey Prigarin, leader of the Union of Communists, 
who talked about the results of the meeting of the ruling bodies 
of all-Russia communist parties, held at the end of last year. 
The meeting, he pointed out, proclaimed the start of the 
consolidation of the previously uncoordinated and extremely 
small All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Russian 
Communist Workers' Party, the Russian Party of Communists, the 
Union of Communists, and the Leninist Platform in the CPRF 
[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]. 
  According to Aleksey Prigarin, the basis for the 
consolidation of these forces was provided by their common 
stance on the December elections and referendum. 
  Particular attention was devoted by the news conference 
organizers to an exposition of their view on the stance adopted 
by the CPRF leadership, given the conditions actually existing 
in Russia. As Aleksey Prigarin put it, the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation, headed by Gennadiy Zyuganov, had, in 
effect, adopted social-democratic positions. Aleksey Prigarin 
decribed the emergent Union's relations with the CPRF as 
"amicably hostile."

  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The coordinating council of 
the Military for Democracy Movement has supported the idea to 
create a system of state political control over power 
structures. Its statement, received by ITAR-TASS today, pointed 
out that the absence of such control "resulted in the 
self-isolation of the armed forces and the work of the military 
leadership without taking into consideration the economic and 
political processes in Russia." As a result of it, authors of 
the statement believe, "social tension among servicemen 
heightened both in the Army and the Navy." 
  The Military for Democracy Movement urged the Russian 
president and government to "take all necessary measures for 
improving the situation in the power structures of the Russian 
Federation, for which the personnel policy should be shaped 
directly by the Russian president."

  [Text] A specter is stalking Europe. It is the specter of 
fascism, and it is not from the opposition but from the 
executive, said leaders of the National Salvation Front said at 
a news conference today. 
  As confirmation of the fact that the country is moving 
toward 
dictatorship, (Viktor Ryukhin) primarily cited the president's 
dissolution of the Ministry of Security, in his words, the only 
organization capable to standing up to political and physical 
terror. So what was the KGB doing then, if not engaging in 
terror? 
  [Begin (Ryukhin) recording] The present situation in Russia 
is reminiscent of that of 1933 and 1934 in Germany. The 
constitution has been thrown right out just as in Germany at 
that time. It would seem that Russia does have a law, but it is 
utterly inoperative. [end recording] 
  [Reporter] It was said several times that the authorities 
have set up some kind of death squads which were allegedly tried 
out during the October tragedy. True, the opposition went on to 
the attack, thank God not with weapons, but with statements from 
the committee in defense of the victims of political terror and 
the Lefortovo committee. The statement says the shooting at the 
defenders of the White House was violence against democracy, 
just like the shooting of Barkashov and the subsequent detention 
of a wounded man with no legal grounds of any kind. 
  However, when journalists asked if they have any documentary 
confirmation of a Zionist [word indistinct] squad taking part in 
the storming of the White House and of the authorities' forming 
death squads, the patriots were unable to give an intelligible 
answer.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Smirnov, secretary of the </F>
Democratic Party of Russia's "ruling body," by Valentina 
Nikiforova; place and date not given: "Our Deputies Did Not 
Take Leave"] 
  [Text] Many voters have admitted voting for Communists and 
Agrarians although they also sympathized with the Democratic 
Party of Russia. Three weeks later Democratic Party of Russia 
headquarters is receiving telephone calls again. People are now 
asking: Are the Travkinites preparing to work in the State 
Duma? It is said that people from government blocs are already 
sharing out the positions.... What is the party doing? PRAVDA 
asked Vyacheslav Smirnov, secretary of the Democratic Party of 
Russia's ruling body, to talk about this. 
  [Smirnov] Our deputies did not take [New Year] leave, and on 
1 January party leader Nikolay Ilich Travkin relinquished his 
powers as head of the administration of Moscow Oblast's 
Shakhovskiy Rayon and set about preparing for serious work in 
the Duma. Our faction, although for the time being this is a 
conditional name, is not very big. That is why consultations 
with deputies from other blocs are now going on. There have 
been meetings with the Agrarians, the Communists, the Women, the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord, "Yabloko," and even the 
Liberal Democratic Party's "second echelon." The main topic is 
how to stop the Duma turning into a farce. There are fears that 
people will immediately try to discredit it. 
  [Nikiforova] Have Democratic Party of Russia deputies agreed 
to do only ordinary work or do they aspire to leading posts in 
the Duma and in committees? 
  [Smirnov] Our deputies have no particular aspirations. But 
there have been enticing offers. For instance, to S. Glazyev 
and O. Bogomolov. The party's ruling body has advised them not 
to refuse. 
  [Nikiforova] What is S. Govorukhin doing? 
  [Smirnov] The party has given Stanislav Sergeyevich the task 
of completing the film "The Great Criminal Revolution." If 
deputies are able to watch it at the beginning of the Duma's 
proceedings I am sure that work will proceed more productively.

incorporated in Russia. Following Shakhray's speech, 15 deputies 
of Tuva, Yakutia, Karachayevo-Cherkessia, Mari-El, Dagestan, 
Ingushetia, North Ossetia and other autonomies declared the 
setting up of a group which would nominate Sergey Shakhray for 
the position of the State Duma speaker. The deputies said that 
the group will work for implementation of the Federative Treaty. 
They want this group to be given the standing of a 
parliamentary party to be able to contribute to the formation of 
the State Duma bodies.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord supports the position of the Inter-regional 
Association of Independent Deputies on the election of the State 
Duma leadership. 
  Party leader Sergey Shakhray, who is also Russian vice-prime 
minister, told a news conference in Moscow on Thursday that 
there have been attempts by large election blocs to predetermine 
the fate of the State Duma behind the back of the majority of 
deputies. He stressed that the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord is ready for forming a broad coalition in the Duma "at 
least on the basis of a common approach towards the principle of 
election of the Duma chairman." This would ensure the equality 
of all deputies, he added. 
  Independent deputies of the State Duma warned on Wednesday 
that large election blocs are seeking to gain control of the 
State Duma. 
  A statement issued by the Inter-Regional Association of 
Independent Deputies of the lower house of the Federal Assembly 
suggested reforming the house factions not only by the principle 
of their party orientation, but also by other principles. It 
also proposed forming ruling bodies of the house on a parity 
basis. The deputies believe that every candidate should be 
elected by secret ballot. 
  They said that deputies of the State Duma chairman should be 
elected on a parity basis: One from the election blocs and the 
other from individual constituencies. Additionally, the house 
procedural regulations should be based not on a party principle, 
but on the principle of multi-factionalism which takes into 
account the interests of the whole deputy corps. As for the 
procedural regulations they should not violate the constitution 
or contradict the voters's will, the deputies said. 
  Shakhray said his party believes that the government should 
raise the question of confidence in itself in the State Duma. 
This would be a "forestalling step by the Cabinet of Ministers 
to promote interaction between the government and the 
parliament." In any case "we will support Viktor Chernomyrdin 
as prime minister," Shakhray added.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] Leader of the Agrarian Party [AP] of Russia Mikhail 
Lapshin says Russian troops must continue to guard the 
Tajik-Afghan border. "If not, our external borders will soon lie 
just outside Moscow," he told Interfax. 
  While hailing Russia's peacemaking role in what Russian 
diplomats describe as "near abroad" countries (meaning former 
Soviet republics), the AP leader is skeptical about Russia's 
involvement in similar operations elsewhere. In his view, 
Russia should have stayed away from the UN peace mission in the 
former Yugoslavia after betraying its fellow Slavs, notably 
Serbs there. 
  Nor does Lapshin share the foreign ministry's position on 
Iraq. "Supporting US police actions is not Russia's business," 
he said, adding: "I have a vague idea of the ruling regime in 
Iraq, but regimes come and go while people stay on." 
  The electoral platform of the Agrarian Party, which consults 
on foreign policy issues with former Soviet Foreign Minister 
Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, did not contain a section on 
international affairs. There are two reasons to explain this, 
Lapshin said. One is the brevity of the election campaign. The 
other -- foreign policy issues as applied to the strategy and 
tactics of the Agrarian Party, place the need for independent 
but competent experts. In our view, should the AP find itself 
to be a tiny party in the new parliament, it ought to focus on 
the farming sector's problems alone, he said, but with broader 
representation, the party would elaborate its own approach to 
foreign policy issues. 
  Judging from Lapshin's interview, the AP's approaches appear 
to be shaping up. Our party, he said, sets great store by 
Russia's economic and political independence. On foreign policy 
matters, Lapshin said the AP would stick to the concept of the 
country's self reliance for food, which among other things, 
provides for government regulation of food imports.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Leontyev commentary: "Elections Financing: "None </F>
Will be the Wiser?"] 
  [Text] Today is the deadline for submitting to the Central 
Electoral Commission documents about the sources of financing 
for the election campaigns of deputies and electoral blocs. 
While some blocs will have no difficulty providing the 
documents, a sizable number of deputies and parties have nothing 
to line up. One need not be surprised at a situation where, for 
example, the special account of "Zhirinovskiy's party" will show 
"zero" both in income and outgo in addition to the 50 million 
rubles issued by the Central Electoral Commission. Whereas the 
LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] had to disclose this 
account if only to receive the government subsidy for television 
in the election campaign, for many deputies doing so simply made 
no sense. 
  The fact is that the election regulation is only very 
particular about the use of special election accounts, whereas 
no one proscribes the use of any other accounts belonging to 
these persons and parties or to totally extraneous ones. This 
is something that virtually all blocs and deputies did. More, 
the extremely detailed rules on the use of special accounts 
envision no concrete sanctions for their violation. Therefore, 
neither the use of foreign sources nor the receipt of state 
funds to finance an election campaign can really endanger one's 
deputy seat thus received. 
  However, accountants for newspapers, radio stations and, 
first and foremost, television have all the documents in payment 
for ads and air time. The content of these documents is no 
commercial secret or even simply confidential information. No 
one is preventing television and the newspapers from publishing 
the sizes and sources of payment of these election campaign 
expenses -- and thereby to fulfill their moral and civic duty 
since the poorly compiled election regulations leave society at 
sea about who finances today's people's choices.

<F P=106> [Viktor Trushkov article: "Edict Not Bound by Constitution"] </F>
  [Text] It was dinned into both us and the world that the 
Russian Federation Constitution would come into force the moment 
it was published, that is, 25 December 1993. It is logical to 
assume that Article 90 of this document came into force at the 
same time. It says, in particular: "The edicts and directives 
of the president of the Russian Federation must not contravene 
the Constitution of the Russian Federation and federal laws." 
Incidentally, it was made the Constitutional Court's duty to 
monitor this. 
  But what fate befell it? First, the Constitutional Court was 
preserved, and second, Section 2 of the new constitution 
stipulates: "Courts in the Russian Federation administer 
justice in compliance with the powers laid down by the present 
Constitution. After the Constitution has come into force, the 
justices of all courts in the Russian Federation retain their 
powers until the expiry of the term for which they were elected. 
Vacancies are filled according to the procedure established by 
the present Constitution." The same document stipulates that in 
all there are 19 Constitutional Court justices (since 13 
justices were elected at the end of 1991, there are six 
vacancies left), justices are elected by the Federation Council, 
and the president submits nominations to the upper house. 
Everything was provided for, no room for false interpretations 
was left. But.... 
  On the day the fundamental law officially came into force 
the 
edict "On Filling Vacancies for Federal Justices" appeared. 
Already it lays down quite different norms. In particular, it 
orders...the Ministry of Justice and the All-Union Congress of 
Justices to submit independent lists of candidates for vacancies 
in the Constitutional Court. But that is not all. The 
president has stretched the number of vacancies by including in 
it the positions now held by V. Zorkin and V. Luchin. Thus, 
along with the new constitution, the Law on the Constitutional 
Court has been contravened. This federal law says that 
justices' powers can be terminated only at their request or when 
they reach the age limit of 65.... But what we have here is 
quite a different matter. 
  It seems that the brand-new, spick-and-span constitution, 
even if it does contain unambiguous norms, does not protect 
awkward customers from arbitrariness on the part of the 
authorities. Of course, this is nothing new. The only new 
element is that the authorities have shown contempt for the 
fundamental law from the very first day it came into force.

<F P=106> [Yelena Shaposhnikova report: "SCSE Deputies"] </F>
  [Text] At a Supreme Court session yesterday examining the 
State Committee for the State of Emergency case Anatoliy 
Lukyanov's and Vasiliy Starodubtsev's lawyers once again made a 
statement regarding the dismissal of the case against their 
clients in accordance with Article 98 of the Constitution 
concerning the privilege of the corps of deputies. What is 
more, the lawyer Genrikh Padva even read out a New Year message 
from Boris Yeltsin to his new comrade-in-arms Anatoliy Lukyanov, 
in which the president voiced hope for their mutual fruitful 
cooperation. 
  The prosecution responded to the defense statement with a 
different explanation of the selfsame Article 98 of the 
Constitution. In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, it is 
not a question of universal, but only of limited [usechennyy] 
immunity, namely from detention, arrest, and searches. No more. 
And that is why interpretation of the contentious article is 
needed from the Constitutional Court, a body to which either the 
president himself, people's deputies, or members of government 
can appeal with queries. And since this is an extremely lengthy 
procedure, the prosecution asked the case of Lukyanov and 
Starodubtsev be be treated separately [vydelit delo Lukyanova i 
Starodubtseva v otdelnoye deloproizvodstvo]. 
  However, after a long meeting the Supreme Court rejected 
both 
the lawyers' arguments and the prosecution's waverings. The 
trial of State Duma Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov and Federation 
Council member Vasiliy Starodubtsev will be continued after 10 
January. 
  The following question arises in this connection: Where is 
Lukyanov to go after Christmas -- to the Duma to "share 
responsibility with the president for the fate of Russia" or to 
the dock? And if he nonetheless prefers the Duma, what will the 
court do then? After all, under Article 98 he can no longer be 
taken there by force!

<F P=106> [Aleksey Chelnokov report: "Barkashov Affair Alive in the </F>
General Prosecutor's Files and in Anonymous Letters"] 
  [Text] The first cross-examination of Aleksandr Barkashov, 
ringleader of the neo-Nazi "Russian National Unity" [RNU] 
movement, who received gunshot wounds at the end of last year, 
was held 4 January. In the interests of the investigation the 
results of the cross-examination are not being made public. 
Information about the arrested man passed on through TASS 
channels by the Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] Public Relations Center abounds in contradictions. 
Hence the case of Barkashov's gunmen, who played an active role 
in the events of October, has become clouded with improbable 
rumors. 
  On Monday the law-enforcement organs publicly stated that "a 
detailed report on the RNU affair will follow" as early as 
Tuesday. However, at the promised time the power departments' 
press centers seemed to have decided to keep mum. What is more, 
they refused to comment on the report of the MVD Public 
Relations Center that the investigation into Barkashov on the 
prosecutor's directive had been...terminated one week after the 
suppression of the putsch. Vladimir Tskhay, chief of the team 
investigating the Barkashov affair, also refused to clarify 
anything on this question. It is known only that Barkashov is 
being "grilled" by investigators of the Russian Federation 
General Prosecutor's Office. 
  Meanwhile the circumstances of the attempt on the fascist 
ringleader are becoming more and more mysterious. It is not 
even known where exactly it took place. Two versions exist: In 
Zelenograd, and in Moscow Oblast's Krasnogorsk. In the only 
hospital in Zelenograd where the wounded man could have been 
operated on -- the Third City Hospital -- the report carried by 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI that Barkashov stayed there 22 through 30 
December has been categorically denied. Chief doctor Leonid 
Shushelya said that "following the appearance of the false 
report many doctors are refusing to go on duty, fearing 
reprisals from Barkashov's gunmen." 
  The "Krasnogorsk version" looks more authentic. Barkashov 
could have been operated on in three places in this city -- in 
the Krasnogorsk Machine Plant's Medical and Health Ward; in the 
114th District military hospital; and in the Vishnevskiy Central 
Clinical Hospital. Most likely the wounded man was registered 
under an assumed name. 
  How the attempt itself took place is also, to put it mildly, 
a cause of bewilderment. It is known for a fact that the 
fuehrer's bodyguard would never leave their leader's side. How 
did he come to be on the street in the hours before dawn, and 
completely alone? Why did the criminals not "finish off" their 
victim at that deserted hour? And finally, a strange 
coincidence: Where on earth did the car which took Barkashov to 
the operating table at 0400 hours come from...? 
  A person close to Barkashov told me that it cannot be ruled 
out that the incident was staged: that Barkashov shot himself, 
or received the friendly "assistance" of his comrades-in-arms. 
Only to what end? Yet another riddle... 
  Another riddle is the fact that the fuehrer is now being 
treated in the Russian Federation MVD Central Hospital, 
although, General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazanik said, he has been 
charged under a number of articles of the Criminal Code. 
  The other day many mass media were faxed a "Russian National 
Unity statement" in defense of their leader and signed by "the 
RNU Council." Another riddle: It is known that on 28 September 
last year Viktor Krivov, chairman of the RNU Council, quarreled 
with Barkashov and took some of the gunmen with him from the 
White House. So that a united Russian National Unity Council 
simply does not exist. 
  The Barkashov affair is turning into a web of unexplained 
circumstances. Some RNU members believe that it will never be 
untangled. Barkashov, thanks to influential friends in the 
power departments, will quickly find himself free, and ordinary 
members will take the rap for him on prison bunks.

<F P=106> [Sergey Turchenko report: "Attempt on A. Barkashov's Life. </F>
Many Theories, Truth Hidden"] 
  [Text] SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA has already reported (4 January 
1994) that an attempt was made on the life of Aleksandr 
Barkashov, leader of Russian National Unity [RNU], 22 December. 
He is currently in an MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] 
hospital with a severe gunshot wound. In a statement issued 
through ITAR-TASS the Russian MVD promised to publish the 
official version of the circumstances surrounding this act of 
terrorism by 4 January. But the facts that have reached the 
editorial office so far are not only contradictory but sometimes 
mutually exclusive. 
  According to one theory, friends took the wounded RNU leader 
to an ordinary Zelenograd hospital under an assumed name. The 
Russian special services tracked him down and moved him to the 
MVD hospital, where Barkashov is allegedly being held under 
arrest in connection with the events of 3-4 October. 
  But the General Prosecutor's Office investigations group 
reported that Kazannik had long ago rescinded Barkashov's arrest 
warrant for lack of evidence. 
  According to another theory, supporters of the RNU leader 
had 
themselves asked the MVD to move him to a militia hospital and 
organize security, since they feared another terrorist attack on 
Barkashov, who allegedly knows certain details of the Supreme 
Soviet shooting that could be "deadly" for some people. 
  In this connection the following frank admission in 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS (5 January 1994) strikes me as 
interesting: 
  "A statement by the `fuehrer' (Barkashov -- S.T.) received 
by 
us but not yet published clearly states that this brigade (the 
NATO 6th Brigade -- S.T.) under the command of Colonel Dzheyk 
Kenti [name as transliterated] methodically shot people on both 
sides at the White House in October so as to `make the conflict 
more bloody.' Israel's `Jericho' 4th Special Forces Brigade and 
the `Veytar' [name as transliterated] paramilitary organization 
were particularly brutal in dealing with unarmed women and old 
veterans. Moreover, in Barkashov's opinion, Yeltsin officially 
ordered that two high-ranking CIA station chiefs be attached to 
the Security Ministry and that all the security agents to 
coordinate their operations with them." 
  I will not make any judgment as to the accuracy of this 
report, but if it contains even a grain of truth, Barkashov's 
life could indeed be in serious danger.

<F P=106> ["Edict of the Russian Federation President on the Formation </F>
of the Russian Federation Republic Budget and Its Relationship 
With the Budgets of the Russian Federation Components in 1994," 
signed by Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin and dated 22 
December 1993] 
  [Text] With the aim of ensuring the uninterrupted 
financing of state expenditure pending the adoption of the 
Russian Federation Law "On the Russian Federation Republic 
Budget for 1994," and in accordance with Points 2 and 3 of the 
Edict of the Russian Federation President dated 7 October 1993 
No. 1598 "On Legal Regulation in the Period of Constitutional 
Reform in the Russian Federation," I decree: 
  1. That it is laid down that the revenue of the Russian 
Federation republic budget in 1994 is formed by: 
  value-added tax; 
  tax on the profit of enterprises and organizations; 
  excise duty on petroleum, gas, coal, spirits, vodka, 
liqueurs, automobiles, and goods imported onto the territory of 
the Russian Federation; 
  income from foreign economic activity; 
  income tax from individuals (at a rate of 1 percent); 
  deductions (taxes) on the reproduction, protection, and 
defense of forests; 
  deductions on the reproduction of the mineral and raw 
materials base, with the exception of deductions which, 
according to the established procedure, remain under the control 
of mining enterprises that independently finance geological 
exploration work; 
  payments for the right to use natural resources; 
  tax on transactions involving securities, specifically 
payments for the registration in the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Finance of prospectuses on the emission of securities, and 
also payments on deals made using securities; 
  income from the privatization of federal property, dividends 
from shares belonging to the state, and income from the 
commercial use of state property by enterprises, institutions, 
and organizations; 
  money from land tax and rent for agricultural land paid into 
the Russian Federation republic budget by national-state and 
administrative-territorial formations for the financing of 
centralized measures; 
  the state duty on cases examined by arbitration courts; 
  other taxes, duties, and payments determined by Russian 
Federation legislation. 
  2. That the following are consolidated in the Russian 
Federation republic budget: all non-budget state funds, whose 
revenue is formed by compulsory payments by enterprises, 
institutions, and organizations with the exception of the 
Russian Federation Pension Fund, the Social Insurance Fund, and 
the Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund, preserving the targeted 
orientation of the consolidated funds. 
  The organs of state power of the components of the Russian 
Federation are recommended to consolidate similar non-budget 
regional funds within the budgets of national-state and 
administrative-territorial formations. 
  3. That the channeling of excise received from the sale of 
automobiles for citizens' personal use into the revenue of the 
Russian Federation Federal Road Fund is discontinued. The 
Russian Federation Council of Ministers-Government is to 
introduce into the established procedure proposals on 
compensation for losses in the revenue of the Russian Federation 
Federal Road Fund. 
  4. That it is laid down that decisions of the federal organs 
of power adopted after 1 January 1994 which lead to an increase 
in expenditure in the budgets of national-state and 
administrative-territorial formations are of a recommendatory 
nature. The implementation of such decisions is carried out on 
the basis of individual decisions of the governments of 
republics within the Russian Federation and the administrations 
of krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and 
the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, out of and within the 
limits of the revenues of their own respective budgets. 
  5. That it is laid down that income tax receipts from 
individuals which constitute the difference between the tax 
rates established by the Edict of the Russian Federation 
President dated 11 December 1993 No. 2129 "On the Regulation of 
Certain Questions of the Taxation of Individuals," and the part 
subject to inclusion in federal budget revenue are included in 
the revenue of the budgets of national-state and 
administrative-territorial formations. 
  6. That the Russian Federation Council of 
Ministers-Government is permitted to transfer the following 
revenues from federal taxation to the budgets of components of 
the Russian Federation: 
  50 percent of the total income from excise on spirits, 
vodka, 
and liqueurs, with the exception of excise on goods of this type 
imported onto the territory of Russia; 
  100 percent of the total income from other excise with the 
exception of excise on petroleum, gas, coal, automobiles, and 
goods imported onto the territory of Russia; 
  25 percent of the total income from value-added tax with the 
exception of the value-added tax on goods imported onto the 
territory of Russia, precious metals, and precious stones 
deposited in the Russian Federation State fund and released from 
it; 
  payments for the right to use natural resources according to 
the norms established by legislation; 
  the payment of taxes on operations involving securities, 
specifically payments for the registration of prospectuses for 
the emission of securities in the localities. 
  7. That it is laid down that additional taxes and duties in 
republics within the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the 
autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and the cities of Moscow 
and St. Petersburg and additional local taxes and duties not 
stipulated by Russian Federation legislation may be introduced 
by decisions of organs of state power of components of the 
Russian Federation and local organs of state power. The payment 
of these taxes by legal entities should be effected out of the 
profit remaining to enterprises and organizations following the 
payment of income tax. 
  8. That a financial support fund is to be organized for the 
regions within the Russian Federation republic budget for 1994. 
  The Russian Federation Council of Ministers-Government is to 
ratify by 15 February 1994, following coordination with 
components of the Russian Federation, and implement as of the 
second quarter of 1994 the procedure for the formation and use 
of the aforementioned fund, which envisages common rules for the 
determination of the scale of financial support to the regions 
and the establishment of the direct dependence between the size 
of the aforesaid fund and the revenue of the Russian Federation 
republic budget. 
  9. That the Russian Federation Council of 
Ministers-Government is to prepare proposals on changing the 
Russian Federation budget and tax legislation which follow on 
from the provisions of the present edict and to implement these 
in the first quarter of 1994 in the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly. 
  10. That the present edict is to be submitted for 
examination by the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. 
  11. That the present edict enters into force as of the 
second quarter of 1994 unless a different one is adopted by the

<F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov report: "Duma Should Consider How To Keep </F>
Promises Made by Deputies During Election Campaign"] 
  [Text] I am making a small request of readers -- work out 
how much deputies have promised their voters. I got cracking 
and figured it out -- 333 trillion rubles [R]! 
  To put that figure in context, the state budget for the 
fourth quarter is just R17 trillion. You have to be a real 
fantasist to promise the unimaginable! 
  So what is imaginable? 
  I have already written about the state budget in the fourth 
quarter of last year. I can now quote the revised figures. 
  In order to limit the Russian Federation republic budget 
deficit in 1993 to no more than 10 percent of GNP, republic 
budget expenditure in the fourth quarter of 1993 has been set at 
R22,246.8 billion. 
  The ceiling for the Russian Federation budget deficit in the 
fourth quarter of 1993 has been set at R5,510 billion after 
being partly reduced by revenue of R1,500.1 billion from foreign 
loans granted to the Russian Federation. 
  Where has this money gone? 
  The revised spending on financing the economy in the fourth 
quarter comes to R2,958.8 billion, including R1,368.3 billion in 
state subsidies. 
  R3,628.5 billion has been allocated to fund state programs 
and investments, specifically: 
  the agro-industrial complex -- R526.4 billion; 
  financial support for northern regions -- R558.3 billion; 
  the program to support peasant farms -- R21.3 billion; 
  the enterprise support fund -- R12.8 billion; 
  funding for defense sector enterprises undergoing conversion 
-- R159.1 billion. 
  Defense spending comes to R4,476.4 billion, and spending on 
foreign economic activity to R1,303.1 billion. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has instructed the 
government 
to adopt for execution the revised spending figures for the 
republic budget in the fourth quarter of 1993. And he has 
submitted this edict for examination by the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly which, as is well known, will meet in January! 
  Our Duma will have the difficult job of thinking about how 
to 
sanction this lost money with dignity.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Velichenkov: "Privatization Dessert; </F>
In Late December Government Adopted New State Program of 
Privatization"] 
  [Text] Behind this document we can discern the guiding 
hand of the GKI [State Committee for the Administration of State 
Property] leadership. Let us recall that the GKI's previous 
attempts to establish a new state program ended with the program 
being recalled for further work while the GKI ultimately issued 
a statement on the extension of the operation of the old 1992 
state program for a further three years. 
  The GKI has several reasons for wanting the program to be 
adopted right now. The main one is the desire to avoid a 
detailed examination in the new parliament which would end in an 
as yet unknown way. The document is being put into operation by 
a president's edict. It is characteristic that its draft lacked 
the point, traditional for the president's October and November 
decrees, according to which the document should be examined and 
approved by the Duma. But in the end it was decided not to 
bypass article three of the law on privatization, in accordance 
with which the state program is put into operation by parliament. 
  One of the document's clauses is extremely curious, banning 
the use of procedures for re-registering debts on which state 
enterprises have defaulted as bills of exchange and circulating 
these bills on the secondary market in securities. In practice 
that means one thing: The opportunity for demanding the payment 
of debts from state enterprises is closed. As a result sooner 
or later the need will arise for another reciprocal setting off 
of debts. By defending its own property from being dragged 
apart in accordance with bill of exchange commitments, the GKI 
is in fact creating a situation in which no one is responsible 
for state enterprises' debts: neither the state nor the state 
enterprise itself. 
  The government session particularly criticized the benefits 
for investment funds (and that is tax legislation, not 
privatization legislation), procedures for the participation of 
foreign investors, and also the need to adopt a state program 
"for just half a year," that is until the voucher's term runs 
out. Although changing the privatization concept at a moment 
when the population has already used 80 percent of the vouchers 
is quite obviously already impossible. 
  Despite the fact that the state program provisions have been 
worked through, individual "underwater rocks" could prove too 
sharp. One of them is the privatization of uncompleted 
construction projects. This point is internally contradictory 
and provides unjustified benefits for the enterprise personnel 
and does not coincide with this question's interpretation by the 
recent Russian Federation Supreme Arbitration Court plenum. 
  The program also contains points which allow an expanded 
interpretation and which go beyond the framework of 
privatization legislation. But the program's main feature lies 
elsewhere. Without declaring new slogans, the new document fully 
confirms the thesis that within the framework of the current 
privatization there has been an internal substitution of its 
aims which has gone almost unnoticed. Instead of the "free" 
issue of state property to citizens proclaimed at the start, a 
different aim has emerged -- the speediest removal of vouchers 
from circulation and the retention of the maximum proportion of 
unprivatized property under GKI patronage. To judge by Ye. 
Gaydar's speech at the government session, the subsequent 
scenario looks like this: The actual concept of privatization 
will change and the rights of labor collectives will be 
substantially curtailed. 
  By the end of the vouchers' term no more than one third of 
state property will have transferred to private hands. Although 
110 million vouchers have already been put to use. In this 
connection serious doubts are strengthening that each voucher 
will be worth one 160 millionth of Russia's property. 
  In that sense the indexing of vouchers looks very 
attractive. 
But it looks as though it is possible only on paper as, indeed, 
is the indexing of fixed production capital. But for some 
reason the latter is being carried out for the second time in 
the past 18 months. Yet the indexing of vouchers has become 
something like a banned topic. In fact only enterprises' 
working capital is being privatized for vouchers now, that is 
the proportion of fixed capital at 1987 prices is becoming 
insignificantly small in the structure of the property of any 
enterprise. They can be spared this either by a decision of the 
GKI on indexing the voucher or by an analogous GKI decision on 
bringing working capital into line with 1987 prices through 
reverse inflation indexing. Either measure would fill the 
voucher with real values and not inflationary working capital. 
  To all appearances the SKI will not make up its mind to do 
that. The reasons are understandable. By leaving the "sweet 
course" for dessert it is reliably ensuring itself work for many 
years to come.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Fomin, Russian first deputy minister of </F>
fuel and energy: "What Will Oil Pool Provide?"] 
  [Text] The intensive reduction of oil extraction in Russia 
began after 1988, which went down in history as the year when 
the maximum of 569.5 million tonnes was extracted. Over the 
past six years the volume of annual extraction has declined by 
over 210 million tonnes. In the past two years the steepness of 
the spiral of decline has been characterized by the following 
indicators: a decline of 60 million tonnes in 1992 and of a 
further 50 million tonnes last year. In brief, the sector is in 
a deep crisis. 
  Why? The whole point is that there can be no talk of one 
single reason: Problems have mingled and settled one on top of 
another. It is scarcely possible to emerge swiftly and 
painlessly from beneath their heavy weight. 
  First of all we must consider that the quality of the 
sector's raw material base has changed -- and not for the 
better. The highly productive stocks in local deposits have to 
a considerable extent already been worked out, and this is the 
primary reason for the intensive reduction in extraction. 
Virtually the entire array of oil boreholes has had to be 
transferred from the gusher method to mechanized methods of 
extraction. It is the turn of the mass commissioning of 
low-yielding deposits. The result is a drastic increase in 
demand for material and financial resources for the sector's 
development. 
  These increased demands have, unfortunately, come up against 
an opposite trend -- a reduction in centralized capital 
investments in the development of oil extraction. The year of 
maximum extraction, 1988, has by an irony of fate become the 
last year in which sufficient funds were earmarked for drilling. 
Budget investments were a fair, albeit partial, compensation 
for the extremely low prices for oil. Through this policy the 
much-maligned administrative edict system nonetheless kept the 
sector afloat. The drastic cutting off of budget capital 
investments can only be described as a crime, with subsequent 
aggravating relapses. 
  The shortage of finance has meant a reduction in the volume 
of investments in the development of deposits, which has led in 
particular to the curtailment of drilling work. Thus the volume 
of operational drilling for oil has declined from 36 million 
meters in 1988 to 20 million meters in 1992, that is it has 
nearly halved. The pace of commissioning new deposits and the 
provision of wellhead facilities have declined. Because of the 
lack of technical and financial assets over 30,000 boreholes are 
standing idle, and the necessary operating regimes are not being 
ensured at operating wells. 
  There are also problems of a geopolitical nature, connected 
with the big economic and political upheavals in the economies 
of the former Union and Russia. Links have been disrupted 
between enterprises, and without them the sector's material 
resource provision is being disrupted. The breakdown of 
traditional contacts with Azerbaijan and Ukraine, on whose 
territory the majority of USSR plants producing oil industry 
equipment and oil pipes for the entire country were located, has 
been a disaster. When will Russia develop a similar industry of 
its own? 
  Not all sources of problems should be sought in the past -- 
some are emerging now. The sector's plight is being aggravated 
by mistakes in the price and tax policies being pursued in the 
course of economic reforms. These have not allowed oil industry 
enterprises to obtain a sufficient volume of funds of their own 
to make up for the centralized budget investments which the 
sector used to use for its development. The shortage of 
financial resources is fatally compounded by the overall crisis 
of nonpayment in the economy, whereby our enterprises, because 
of the rapid pace of inflation, take a long time to obtain money 
for the output they dispatch. The scale of the nonpayment 
problem -- debts to the fuel and energy complex are building up 
in an avalanche and are already approaching 10 trillion rubles 
-- of course greatly exceeds all others. At any rate, were it 
not for nonpayment many financial difficulties would have been 
overcome independently by the sector. Now it is in an impasse. 
  We should not pin hopes on the introduction of promissory 
notes. To whom should we present a promissory note? To the 
municipal services, to whom we are obliged to supply energy 
resources despite their inability to pay? Or to the industrial 
enterprises whose fixed capital is worth several times less than 
its debts? The process has gone so far that measures 
characteristic of an efficient market economy are no help here. 
  As a result of the simultaneous operation of these and other 
adverse factors, the accumulation and mingling of problems 
continues. It is not only oil extraction which is in decline -- 
the entire oil industry is experiencing a slump and crisis is 
paralyzing the oil supply system. A paradoxical situation has 
taken shape: While we are grieving over the drastic decline in 
production we are unable to sell readily the oil we have already 
obtained. 
  Export deliveries are being disrupted. For instance, as of 
24 November we had failed to deliver over 2 million tonnes of 
oil on schedule. At Novorossiysk, where our main terminal is 
located, we have been hampered by stormy weather, but in Ukraine 
and Belarus it is not just the elements that call the tune. We 
have been obliged to restrict deliveries to them because of 
chronic nonpayment. Once they encounter a few frosts they 
sometimes take advantage of the fact that oil pipelines cross 
their territory and try to lay hands on oil that does not belong 
to them, that is, they are simply starting to steal it. Thus in 
Belarus, in the Mozyr region, 112,000 tonnes of oil were 
recently stolen in a few days. 
  There are many problems connected with oil storage in Russia 
itself. Right now there is no room for nearly 3 million tonnes. 
A crisis has overtaken oil refining. Over the first 10 months 
of last year its volume declined by 31 million tonnes compared 
with the same period in 1992. The production of automobile 
gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil was respectively 84, 84.3, and 
88.1 percent of the same period in 1992. 
  Another result of nonpayment has been the overstocking of 
oil 
refineries. They are not taking new raw material. According to 
a situation report for one particular day (24 November) five oil 
refineries turned away over 45,000 tonnes of oil. For instance, 
the "Angarsknefteorgsintez" association (and that means a little 
over 30,000 tonnes) refused deliveries completely. The Saratov 
oil refinery refused Kazakhstan oil: It cannot even "digest" 
its own Russian crude: Since the start of the year it has 
turned away 181,000 tonnes. 
  The nonpayment problem, while objectively destabilizing the 
operation of the finely tuned system of oil and oil refinery 
product supply, is also pernicious in that ordinary 
extravagance, inefficiency, and carelessness are hidden in its 
shadow. One way or another -- even under conditions of the 
constant reduction of extraction -- the transport pipeline 
network is constantly being overloaded. For instance, in the 
course of 24 hours we accepted 890,000 tonnes of oil but were 
able to distribute only about 850,000 tonnes, and the rest had 
to be left in the system. This counterwave ultimately surges 
back to the operating boreholes and may be said to lash them. 
That is why they have to be brought to a standstill. 
  Will anyone see one of the most serious problems behind such 
chaos -- the extremely low yield of the oil reservoirs? And is 
now the time to worry about it? Despite everything, now is the 
time; because if we do not solve it, there is no future, there 
are no prospects. Can we really consent to leaving over half of 
the petroleum underground? This is impermissible now. After 
all, in the future we will have to bore deeper and deeper, 
overcoming the increasingly complex geological structure of the 
earth's interior. Developing such reserves requires the use of 
expensive new equipment, the creation of efficient methods of 
increasing the oil yield of productive strata. 
  Raising the oil yield of the strata thus becomes a strategic 
sphere of scientific-technical progress in the sector and 
another very important condition of the stabilization and 
development of oil extraction. That is precisely why, as more 
and more new deposits with reserves which are difficult to 
extract are put into exploitation, the scale of testing and the 
industrial use of hydrodynamic, chemical, thermal, and gas 
methods of increasing the oil yield is growing. Russia has at 
its disposal practically all the technologies which are 
currently used extensively worldwide. Laboratory research and 
industrial testing of unconventional methods of bed stimulation 
are also being developed -- vibration-seismic, biotechnological, 
and intrastratal generation of working agents. 
  Since the future of oil extraction is determined by the 
application and growth in efficiency of new methods and 
technologies, an analysis of the dynamics of this process is 
relevant. At present over 20 methods of increasing the oil 
yield and over 130 technologies for implementing them are being 
applied at experimental and industrial level. Work connected 
with them is being conducted at 333 facilities, and over 5 
billion tonnes of initial reserves of oil are involved here. In 
1992 an extra 33 million tonnes of oil were extracted as a 
result of the application of methods for increasing the oil 
yield of the strata, including: 24.3 million tonnes from 
hydrodynamic methods of stimulation, 6.7 million tonnes from 
physical-chemical methods, 1.5 million from thermal methods, and 
0.5 million tonnes from gas methods. 
  The speed at which oil extraction is increaased as a result 
of applying the aforementioned methods will depend on the 
relationship between the favorable and hindering factors. 
Experts are making the following predictions for additional 
extraction from applying the new methods: 10-20 million tonnes 
by the year 2000, and 20-40 million tonnes by 2010. 
  So what is hindering us from making full use of the 
advantages of the new methods and technologies of raising the 
oil yield of the strata? Apart from the shortage of technical 
resources and chemical materials, the high proportionate 
exploitation costs and capital expense involved in utilizing 
them have raised serious obstacles. These are far higher than 
in traditional methods of oil extraction. Measures of a 
legislative and normative nature are needed, aimed at economic 
incentives for the application of efficient new methods of 
raising the oil yield of deposits. These measures would enable 
us to raise a whole stratum of problems, such as the financing 
of scientific-research and experimental-design work in the 
creation of new technologies and technical resources and the 
development of the material-technical base of institutes 
involved in the creation of the new methods. The main thing, 
however, is that prospects will be opened up for increasing the 
oil yield from deposits with reserves that are difficult of 
access.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Oil Production To Fall by 30 Million </F>
Tonnes in Russia in 1994"] 
  [Text] In 1994, Russia will produce 327 million tonnes of 
oil with gas condensate compared to 357 million tonnes in 1993. 
The rate of oil production will be 8 percent against 10.5 
percent in 1993 and 14 percent in 1992. These figures are cited 
in a draft report projecting the country's social and economic 
development in 1994 prepared by Russian Economy Ministry experts. 
  At present Russia rates third in the world in oil production 
after Saudi Arabia and the United States. The Russian oil 
complex comprises in particular 148,000 oil wells, 48,300 km of 
main oil pipelines, 28 oil refineries that can refine between 
themselves more than 300 million tonnes of oil a year. Being 
developed are 840 oil fields. Enterprises of the oil industry 
and auxiliary services employ nearly 900,000 people including 
nearly 20,000 in the field of science. 
  More than 40 joint enterprises created with firms of the 
United States, France, Canada, Britain, Switzerland, Austria, 
Belgium, Czechoslovakia [as published], and a number of other 
countries are functioning in the country's oil sector.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "What Inflation Was Like in December </F>
1993"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Council of 
Ministers-Government center for the economic situation reports 
that according to operational figures for the weekly monitoring 
of prices in December: 
  the overall inflation index was about 112 percent, including 
102 percent for the period 21-27 December and 800 percent since 
the start of the year; 
  the growth rates of prices for food and nonfood goods 
continued to lag behind the change in rates for paid services 
for the population; 
  the growth of consumer prices in medium and small cities 
outstripped their increase in price in large cities; 
  the volume of sales of food goods was 5 percent higher than 
last month. 
  The cost of a selection of 19 of the most important foods in 
December throughout Russia on average was 30,700 rubles [R] 
calculated on a monthly basis and increased 11 percent compared 
with the previous month and sevenfold since December last year. 
The cost of this selection for stores (irrespective of form of 
ownership) is assessed at an average of R29,500 and for 
unorganized trade at R39,800. The cost of the selection 
according to prices which have taken shape at city and informal 
markets was 35 percent greater than its cost in the stores, as 
was the case in late November. 
  In December the gulf between the maximum and minimum cost of 
the selection in various Russian cities was equal to a factor of 
3.8 times. 
  The greatest increase in the cost of the selection over the 
month was recorded in the Central Chernozem and Northern regions 
-- 16 and 15 percent respectively. And the selection increased 
least in cost in the Central and Northwest regions -- by 7 and 8 
percent. 
  An increase of more than 20 percent in the cost of the 
selection of the most important foods was noted in 13 Russian 
cities. Of these the cost of the selection increased over 30 
percent in Rubtsovsk, Abakan, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and 
Naberezhnyye Chelny. 
  The cost of the selection in Moscow as of 27 December was 
equal to R34,600, exceeding November's level by 6.4 percent, 
while in St. Petersburg it was R29,700 (9.3 percent). In the 
list of observed cities Moscow moved to 35th place (in late 
November it was 33d) while St. Petersburg moved to 58th place 
(it was 59th).

<F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel report: "Ban on Hard Currency Trade So Far </F>
Unable To Influence Russians' Love for the Dollar"] 
  [Text] The auctions which took place in the Moscow 
Currency Exchange 5 January -- the first of the new year -- 
raised the exchange rate to 1,255 rubles [R] to the U.S. dollar, 
whereas in the final trading of last year it stood at R1,247 to 
the dollar. 
  In principle this jump can be considered insignificant in 
percentage terms. However, it is of special note that the 
demand for hard currency 5 January reached a record level for 
the entire existence of the exchange - initial applications to 
buy stood at $182,850,000, but the final volume of transactions 
was recorded at a level of $180,550,000. Thus are we witnessing 
a new flurry of heavy demand on the currencies market, with 
attendant consequences for the ruble? 
  I think that to draw such a conclusion would be premature. 
It is entirely possible that the record volume of hard currency 
trading could be caused by the factor of delayed demand -- after 
all, the exchange had not operated for almost a week. On the 
other hand, the influence of another factor on the change in the 
situation on the currencies market is being viewed extremely 
seriously by specialists. 
  It is well known that an instruction from the Central Bank 
of 
Russia banning the sale of goods and services for foreign cash 
anywhere on the country's territory came into force at the 
beginning of the year. And many trade firms -- and also 
wholesalers supplying goods from abroad -- will be forced right 
from the first days of the new year to convert their ruble 
proceeds via the exchange so as to settle with foreign suppliers 
and maintain trade turnover at its previous level. This should 
objectively lead to an increase in the demand for hard currency 
and to a growth in the daily levels of exchange dealing. 
  Incidentally, here it is worth noting the formerly 
unheard-of 
law-abiding behavior of Russian businesmen, since the 
overwhelming majority of hard currency stores refused to accept 
foreign cash after 1 January. Well, if anyone refuses to accept 
the rubles of Russian citizens anywhere, V. Smirnov, deputy 
chief of the Central Bank of Russia's Main Administration for 
Currency Regulation and Currency Control stated, the bank calls 
on such citizens to inform it about such incidents, and the most 
decisive measures will be adopted. 
  However, so that misunderstandings should not arise, let me 
point out that the Central Bank's instruction banning hard 
currency trade has some exceptions. They regard stores situated 
in the extraterritorial zone, that is to say, after you have 
been through customs, or, say, foreign airlines selling tickets 
on Russian territory. 
  All the same, discrimination against the Russian ruble can 
now be considered to have been eradicated in principle in our 
country. But here the question naturally arises: What is there 
to balance the increase in the supply of rubles from trading 
organizations on the currencies market, so that the exchange 
rate of Russian money should not fall even lower? 
  Only the more active sale of foreign currency by Russian 
citizens could be such a counterweight; according to 
specialists' estimates, the public have already accumulated 
several billion dollars' worth. But such a change in behavior 
patterns cannot, unfortunately, be observed at the moment. 
  At any rate, in the words of S. Stolyarova, chief of the 
"Rossiyskiy Kredit" bank's department of exchange outlets, at 
the end of last year their volume of sales of hard currency to 
the public reached a near-record level. And in the first 
two-three days of the new year the trend has not changed. 
  Nevertheless, it can be hoped that the situation will change 
markedly in two-three weeks' time, when the majority of 
customers of former currency stores will be forced to begin 
exchanging their dollars or German Marks for rubles. After all, 
they will not want to give up frequenting expensive stores and 
restaurants, and foreign cash will not be accepted in these 
places. 
  However, there is no doubt that a radical change in the 
behavior patterns of Russian citizens with regard to foreign 
currency will occur only when the dollar ceases to be a means of 
accumulation and when inflation falls to a level covered by 
interest rates on bank deposits. In this sense December has 
aroused in us real hopes; after all, inflation was at its lowest 
for the whole of the past year -- only 12 percent per month.

<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Bortsov of the Russian State Committee </F>
for Statistics: "Inflation in December Was 12 Percent"] 
  [Text] In December the inflation index was 112 points and 
turned out to be the lowest since the beginning of the year. In 
1993 as a whole prices of consumer goods and services increased 
tenfold. 
  From 21 through 27 December prices of foods increased by 2.3 
percent, nonfood goods by 1.6 percent, and services by 1.7 
percent. 
  The foods that registered the biggest price increases were 
eggs -- six percent; fish products -- 3.9 percent; and 
vegetables -- 3.6 percent. Tobacco products (0.9 percent), 
flour (1.2 percent), and salt (1.3) percent showed the smallest 
increases. Sugar prices remained the same, except in in 
Yoshkar-Ola, Makhachkala, and Ufa, where the price increased by 
4-7 percent. 
  Prices of meat and meat products and bread and bakery 
products increased by 2-2.3 percent on average. 
  In the period before the new year meat prices increased at 
the rate of 3.8 percent in city markets and prices of vegetables 
and fruit increased at the rate of 4.8 percent, a higher rate 
than in the previous weeks of December. 
  In December the price of industrial consumer goods increased 
by 10.5 percent, but at the end of the month the prices of 
cultural and everyday items were hardly rising at all. The 
increase in prices of sewn and knitted goods was within the 
range of 1.3-2.1 percent over the week. 
  The increase in prices and tariffs in the sphere of consumer 
services was higher than in the case of food and commodities and 
was 15.4 percent in December. Against this general background 
the rates for notaries' offices' services showed a sharp, 
twofold increase, since they depend on the official minimum 
level of pay. There was a faster-than-average increase in the 
rates for chargeable medical services. For instance, the charge 
for an initial consultation at the end of December was more than 
2,000 rubles and the charge for a general blood test was 1,233 
rubles. Dry cleaning and hairdressing rates increased by 1.2-2.1 
percent over the week.

<F P=106> [Boris Sopelnyak report: "First We Steal...in Other Words </F>
Accumulate"] 
  [Text] "Honest Business" -- that is the name of an 
international seminar, which has opened in Moscow on the 
initiative of the Criminological Association. 
  We ordinary mortals do not know that lawyers entertain in 
all 
earnestness a concept which acknowledges that enterprise and 
crime are indissolubly linked and that it is time to introduce a 
moratorium on the struggle against economic crime. What are the 
arguments for this? OK. It is impossible to accumulate 
original capital honestly -- that is self-evident. So, a 
moratorium must be introduced. When criminal businessmen steal, 
pardon me, accumulate quite a lot of money, they start investing 
it in legal business, thus helping out society by producing 
goods, creating jobs, and so on. 
  Nonsense? Nothing of the sort. This concept has not emerged 
from nothing and it has quite a few supporters. Admittedly, 
there are also other professors who think that you can avoid 
bloodshed, racketeering, and thievery when accumulating capital, 
but this group is clearly in the minority. 
  Life regrettably confirms that the first group of scientists 
are correct. M. Yegorov, Russian first deputy minister of 
internal affairs, said that over 40,000 state and commercial 
enterprises belong to criminal groupings. These groupings, 
using counterfeit advice slips and other methods, have effected 
financial operations worth over 1 trillion rubles. 
  Typically these bigwigs have little scope for crime and they 
are making vigorous inroads into politics, but this kind of 
fusion of criminals and corrupt politicians is very dangerous. 
The strangest thing is that Russia still does not have clear 
laws to help distinguish between honest and criminal business. 
  Criminal groupings are dividing up spheres of influence at 
full speed -- from below -- but at the very top a completely new 
trend has emerged: the creation of powerful organizations with 
leadership at oblast, kray, or even regional level. 
  In this situation the largest commercial structures must set 
up their own security services, but they still cannot do without 
the militia. And many people realize that. At any rate 
businessmen's mistrust of internal affairs organs is gradually 
subsiding. Today the Ministry of Internal Affairs is willing to 
guard banks and offices and transport money and securities, as 
well as ensure personal security. I am of course only talking 
about honest business. It may nonetheless exist....

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Shcherbak, deputy minister of </F>
agriculture: "A Countryside Without Money Means a Country 
Without Bread. Concerning the Situation in the Agrarian Sector"] 
  [Text] Agriculture had a difficult time last year. The 
problems began in the spring, but the farmers still managed to 
carry out the sowing at the optimum times. We were expecting a 
good crop, and these expectations were bolstered by actual 
results at the start of the harvest. But the farmers were 
unable to buy combines, spare parts, and fuel in good time 
because economic arrangements had not been settled between the 
producers and the purchasers of our products (the rural 
commodity producers did not have their own resources, and credit 
was exhausted). Then there were the adverse weather conditions 
in a number of grain regions. All this delayed the harvest work. 
More than three million hectares were not cleared. The gross 
grain harvest was 100 million tonnes. That is less than 
expected. 
  There were problems with other agricultural crops as well. 
The sugar beet yield was on a par with past years. The gross 
harvest was more than 25 million tonnes. But this time the 
sugar content was somewhat higher. The harvest of oil-seed 
crops was approximately on a par with 1992. As for fruit and 
vegetables and potatoes, the situation is as follows: A large 
part of the harvest (36 million tonnes were harvested) has not 
been taken up. Those who are supposed to store potatoes have 
not been taking them. 
  I believe there are two reasons for this. The first is the 
lack of circulating capital. (Consumers did not receive 
sufficient credit resources either). On the other hand, the 
wholesale depots were privatized during that period and these 
depots found that they could operate more profitably with 
commodities other than perishable products. In short, the 
process was administratively unmanageable, while market 
relations had not yet taken shape. Unfortunately we did not 
succeed in privatizing the entire rural infrastructure, as we at 
the Agriculture Ministry were intending. As a result, no matter 
what production chain you take, it turns out that none of the 
rural workers' partners is making a loss. Processing, even with 
reduced processing volumes, is operating profitably by raising 
the prices of products. The only loser is the rural commodity 
producer. 
  Even the alcohol industry is not taking potatoes any more, 
since it is more profitable to produce alcohol from grain. As a 
result many farms have had to store potatoes themselves, often 
in unsuitable storage facilities. This means that there will be 
major wastage. Moreover, owing to the lack of demand, some of 
the potatoes were not harvested at all, primarily in the 
European part of the country. 
  Livestock numbers continued to decline. This was due not 
only to prices, which are dictated by the processing industry. 
The main problem is that effective consumer demand is low. 
Some of the products are not being taken up. Even in Moscow 
Oblast, where milk yields are at their lowest in winter, a great 
deal of milk stays on the farms. All this is causing rural 
commodity producers to further reduce livestock numbers. There 
has been a marked reduction in per capita consumption of dairy 
and meat products in the current year. 
  Despite the rather good harvest, many agricultural 
enterprises are now almost bankrupt. The state, in the shape of 
"Roskhleboprodukt," which concluded contracts for the purchase 
of grain, owes more than 700 billion rubles [R] for products 
that have already been received. Purchases of oil-seed crops 
have been held up for that reason. Sugar beet has been 
purchased from the countryside, but the payment was in sugar, 
not money. 
  Moreover the state has not paid peasants for meat and dairy 
products that were supplied for processing and to the trade 
network. In view of this, we believe that the total debt to the 
countryside currently stands at more than R2 trillion. 
  This means that farms are unable to make normal preparations 
for next year. For example, we were unable to buy mineral 
fertilizers, seed, and fuel for fall cultivation or storage. 
  Credit policy has been tightened as well. What they are 
saying to us today is: Have the money, but at the bank rate, 
which is more than 200 percent. This means that the prices of 
our products, which are still not being sold in their entirety, 
are rising sharply. For these reasons we left around four 
million hectares of winter crop land unsown. This means that 
next year's harvest is in jeopardy. We left five million 
hectares unplowed in the fall -- which increases the spring 
workload by nine million hectares. Even fewer mineral 
fertilizers were applied than in the previous year. Stocks are 
not being accumulated. 
  It is still not clear what kind of arrangement the state 
will 
have with commodity producers -- whether it will form state food 
stocks or people in the countryside will be left to face the 
vagaries of the market alone. Will the state subsidize 
livestock products or not? All these questions remain 
unanswered. 
  Worst of all is that fact that the major livestock-raising 
complexes and poultry farms, once the most efficient, are now in 
a most difficult situation. They used to buy in feed, which 
became expensive, so production became inefficient. Unless the 
question of mixed feed compensation (at least 50 percent) is 
resolved, they are going to have to start slaughtering poultry, 
but even that would take at least three-four months, and perhaps 
as many as six. And the remaining birds have to be fed with 
something over that six-month period. 
  Even in countries where agriculture is seen as being highly 
industrialized it is still supported by the state in various 
ways. Either by direct subsidies or by price regulation. There 
are countries where the state meets up to 60-70 percent of the 
cost of agricultural production. It is perfectly clear to us in 
the agrarian sphere that Russian agriculture will not survive 
without state support. We appreciate that when the budget is 
bursting at the seams it is very difficult to contemplate such 
things. But a way must be sought. Because if the countryside 
is alive and well, the country and the entire economy will be 
alive and well.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Volkogonov, advisor to the Russian </F>
president on questions of defense, by Yuriy Rubtsov; place and 
date not given: "Armed Forces Are a State Institution"] 
  [Text] [Rubtsov] Dmitriy Antonovich, the immediate reason 
for our conversation was the fact that a number of organs of the 
mass media put out information on a fundamental reorganization 
of our defense department which is allegedly in preparation. 
According to these reports, the president "should" assume direct 
control over the Armed Forces.... Does this information have 
any basis in fact? 
  [Volkogonov] I was informed that the other day a foreign 
radio station had likewise already chimed in with the chorus of 
Russian publications. Journalists are phoning in, including 
foreigners. They are all asking the same question: Is it true 
that in the next few days the Defense Ministry will be 
fundamentally reorganized to become a civilian department, with 
the General Staff left to deal with the specifically military 
issues? 
  I would like to state definitely that all this is no more 
than a rumor. No official decisions on this matter are known to 
me personally. What is more, I think that there won't be any. 
  I think that in principle -- true, this is only my own 
personal view -- in three to four years, or five, or maybe by 
the turn of the century, the ministry probably will go civilian. 
As in all civilized societies it will be made up of civilians, 
of various specialists who will deal with political, technical, 
financial, economic, and international questions and hand over 
both operational and combat issues to a body like the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. But I think that Russia will preserve its 
indigenous tradition, continuing to call this body the General 
Staff. 
  Such a division will be of benefit. But it will only become 
possible when our society becomes very stable and governable. 
It is not right to resort to this kind of reorganization at 
present, indeed it is simply dangerous. This is something for 
the future. 
  I would recommend that when all the necessary prerequisites 
are in place this should be done gradually, step by step, by 
filling the Defense Ministry with civilian specialists and 
handing over particular functions to them. Maybe we should 
introduce an additional post, that of civilian deputy minister 
with responsibility for, say, finances or technical, engineering 
or medical questions. Other such steps should be carried out, 
but only gradually. Our history shows us that extreme 
discontinuity always leads only to confusion, chaos, and to the 
people's losing faith. 
  So I think that the time is not yet right for this major 
reorganization of the defense department about which people are 
writing and speaking. Society and the Army are not ready for it 
yet. I repeat, this is something for the future. 
  One other thing you have to bear in mind is this. We are 
often blamed because the military reforms are proceeding in a 
feeble and slow manner, that they are not really visible, so 
people claim. You can make a quick sketch of any diagram with 
"boxes" representing components of a military system, but this 
is not enough for a reform. The crux of the matter is that the 
main motive force in reforming the Army is financial, economic, 
material. The person who has control over force -- and this is 
only possible when, unlike today, the country has a stable 
economy -- will be able to carry out a real reform. You see, it 
does not in any way come down to combining some organs and 
splitting up others and transferring cadres here or there, as 
even some military men think. What kind of a reform is that! 
You will only get a real reform when, and I repeat, society has 
a suitable material and financial impetus. 
  [Rubtsov] As an advisor to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, you 
clearly know, do you not, what the president's evaluation of the 
Defense Ministry is? 
  [Volkogonov] The Ministry is today in a position to 
discharge its obligations normally, and is actually doing so -- 
this is the president's evaluation in a nutshell. The Army 
played an important role in averting a civil war. Although the 
Army does, of course, have many problems which should be 
resolved. Here gratifying changes can be noted.... 
  [Rubtsov] What do you have in mind? 
  [Volkogonov] Society has become noticeably more governable 
since the well-known events in October. In the last few days I 
have spoken to important statesmen, in particular to Yegor 
Timurovich Gaydar, and they pick this out as a clear trend. The 
vertical structure of executive power has become noticeably 
strengthened, and the government's role has increased, as have 
those of the president and the executive structures in the 
provinces. In time all this will, I think, also be reflected in 
the Army in many areas starting with conscription and ending 
with material security. Such changes will in turn stimulate the 
development of the military reform. 
  [Rubtsov] Dmitriy Antonovich, how from this viewpoint do you 
regard the problem of "the Army and politics." 
  [Volkogonov] I already had the occasion to express my 
opinion on this question prior to the recent elections. Now 
that it is known that the election results in a number of 
regions, including several military garrisons, turned out to be 
-- not to beat about the bush -- discouraging, this topic for 
discussion seems particularly topical. 
  I never could agree that the Army, as one of the state's 
most 
important instruments, can stand outside politics. Yes, it 
should stand outside party politics, but it cannot stand outside 
state politics. It should maintain the same course as the 
government and president/supreme commander in chief are 
steering, a course of security, an official course promoting 
military organizational development, reform, and so on. 
  [Rubtsov] If this matter were completely cleared up, it 
would certainly be easier for the military themselves.... 
  [Volkogonov] It would also, of course, be easier for the 
commanders and their assistants with responsibility for 
education work with personnel. Even so, the fear of breaking 
some rule, of overstepping the mark led to people being 
abandoned to their fates from a spiritual viewpoint. As a 
result quite a few servicemen cast their votes in the election 
on the basis of their mood at the time. It would seem that it 
is already clear: The idea that "the Army stands outside 
politics" was understood in a one-sided, legalistic manner; 
however, several leaders continue to cling onto it. 
  In this connection, I would like to express my own ideas 
about the role of the comparatively new organs working with 
personnel.... 
  [Rubtsov] Incidentally, the editorial office is receiving 
many questions on this.... 
  [Volkogonov] Previously two organs, two institutions 
characterized our system: the security organs and commissars. 
In the days of Stalin both organs tarnished their own 
reputations. I know from my own experience that the commissars 
stuck to those ideological aims which drove us up a historical 
blind alley. In many respects they are guilty of causing the 
present situation in society. I do not absolve myself of 
personal responsibility in this matter. 
  After August 1991 the absolutely correct decision was made 
that old-style ideological indoctrination was no longer 
thinkable in the Army. But at the same time the conclusion was 
reached at the Defense Ministry -- and this has been reflected 
in the president's and government's decisions -- that some 
organs are nevertheless necessary to specially take on the 
education of personnel. I am convinced that the fact that quite 
a few former political workers are employed in these organs 
should not cast doubt on them. 
  It would, in my view, be all the more wrong to put these 
weak 
-- at the moment "feeble" -- organs dealing with personnel 
"under the knife" in the light of the results of an 
"unsuccessful" poll rating. 
  We do not have an equivalent for the educational organs, we 
are unprepared to do without them, and we have neither the 
practice nor the experience of doing so. Some people say that 
the Russian Army did without such organs and no harm was done. 
But after all, how many decades did it take to make the system 
which we had in Russia when the 1917 October Revolution broke 
out, to get the necessary experience and practical work under 
our belts. And what is happening now? We will just destroy, 
eliminate what we have, and this will only lead to a future 
weakening of our spiritual potential. We will only achieve one 
thing -- we will radically cut down our degree of organizational 
influence on the educational processes in the Army. 
  A few people are attempting to blame only the old political 
workers for what has happened. I must say that any attempt to 
sow disharmony among officers is not only unconstructive but 
also dangerous. There were all different kinds of commanders 
and political workers. It is not right to lump them all 
together. But it is necessary to sort out each individual case. 
If a man fails to do his work properly, fails to "make out," he 
should be discharged or found a position commensurate with his 
knowledge and experience, or he should be taught, educated. 
  In my view the personnel organs should, proceeding from 
state 
policy, undertake the education of servicemen in the spirit of 
Russian history, Russian statehood, and the Russian Armed 
Forces. They should pay a great deal of attention to morale 
problems: military ethics and military valor. They simply must 
be at the heart of the work to inculcate the best qualities of 
the Russian soldier in our personnel. I consider that it is 
precisely these organs which should most of all engage in 
patriotic education. We have been called on to revive 
democratic patriotism, a patriotism which is not nationalistic 
or chauvinistic but democratic, taking into account not only our 
own interests but those of other peoples as well. 
  These organs should, of course, explain state policy, the 
supreme commander in chief's policy, and government policy. 
With regard to both foreign and domestic affairs, for example 
what kinds of reforms are in progress here. 
  I think that these organs, especially at the highest level, 
should take particular care of the subunits involved in the 
technology of propaganda. Without this we are deprived of a 
modern means of fighting for people's consciences. 
  These organs will in one form or another be necessary to 
promote the new Russian Constitution. You see, it is the 
Constitution itself which should, in my view, be the basis of 
the moral and legal education of the Russian Army's personnel 
today. 
  What about the cultural organs? We have so many officers' 
messes, clubs, libraries, and ensembles; if we let all this go 
there will be nobody involved professionally in this area, and 
everything will collapse. The claims you hear that only the 
commanders will be equal to all this are, in my view, 
superficial. 
  It is just as important to help the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces Humanities Academy to determine more quickly its role in 
the creation of the necessary psychological climate in the Army 
and Navy, and in arming the relevant workers with the most 
up-to-date information and methods. Managing the spiritual life 
of people in uniform is a complex task. 
  There must be no vacuum in the area of public consciousness. 
Gaps which appear will be filled immediately with anything at 
all -- all sorts of national-socialist prejudices and 
chauvinist, pseudo-patriotic views. I think it unnecessary to 
take a long time to explain what the consequences could be. 
  The Army is a state institution, and all the transformations 
going on in it presuppose a wise, balanced approach and 
circumspection.

<F P=106> [By D. Kokko and V. Gonchar from St. Petersburg's "Severnyy </F>
Zavod" Production Association; from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Kokko over video of missiles] A couple of years 
ago TV crews could not even dream of gaining access to this 
enterprise. For many years the "Severnyy Zavod" Production 
Association produced nothing but missiles for air defense 
systems. Nowadays the need for conversion is felt even here, 
although views differ on how to tackle the problems which have 
arisen. 
  According to the plant's director, owing to shortsighted 
government policy Russia currently has no real chance of 
entering the world market in defense weapon systems. Production 
is declining, but we simply must preserve our high-tech 
facilities. This gave birth to the project to build a spherical 
Tokamak. Previously this argon chamber was used to make wings 
for missiles. Now it is used to make titanium ice-axes for 
Norway. 
  However, recently a project was drawn up in cooperation with 
physicists from the Ioffe Institute to build a spherical Tokamak 
for research in the field of thermonuclear reactions. 
Theoretical studies have already been carried out and a 
1:10-scale model has been built. If it proves possible to 
translate the project to build a spherical Tokamak into reality, 
Russia will undoubtedly take up a leading position in the world 
in the sphere of thermonuclear fusion.

  [Text] Moscow -- Under an order by Colonel General Vasiliy 
Vorobyev, chief of the Main Military Budget and Finance 
Directorate of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry, as of 1 
January 1994 the allocation of funds in Russian or foreign 
currency from the Russian Federation Defense Ministry budget for 
the payment of allowances, salaries, material values, and 
communal and other services to Russian Federation military 
courts will be terminated. This order was issued "in line with 
the 24 December 1993 letter by the Russian Federation Finance 
Ministry" and in execution of the Russian Federation Government 
decree on approving of the Statute on the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Justice. According to this statute, the Justice 
Ministry is tasked with ensuring the requisite conditions for 
the functioning of general jurisdiction and military courts. As 
has become known, however, this decision has come as a total 
surprise for the ministry's leadership because the statute says 
nothing about financing military courts.

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> [Viktor Belikov and Viktor Litovkin report: "My Motherland </F>
Is Vast, But Not for the Su-34"] 
  [Text] IZVESTIYA has secured the exclusive right to be the 
first to talk in the Russian press about the new Su-34 
front-line bomber. Some people have already nicknamed this 
mysterious and top-secret aircraft the "Russian miracle." 
  "No, it is not a `miracle,'" Mikhail Simonov, general 
designer for the Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau and project 
leader, told us, "but the Su-34 series-produced front-line 
bomber, created in our firm. Its chief designer in the design 
bureau is Rollan Martirosov, and in the plant -- Oleg Sobolev." 
  The Su-34 is designed to repulse an attack on Russian 
territory and is to replace in the combat ranks the Su-24 and 
Su-24M front-line bombers which have been flying for almost 20 
years and to resolve certain other tasks. The fourth-generation 
bomber has all the potential for doing this. 
  It has a practically unlimited flight range. Without 
refueling in the air -- it is, nonetheless, equipped with such a 
system -- the Su-34 can fly for 4,000 km without wing tanks! It 
can easily be transferred in a matter of hours from one part of 
the country to another where a threatening situation might 
suddenly arise on the border. 
  Usually, Simonov said, it takes a combat aircraft a whole 
week to fly from the Far East to Tajikistan, for example. 
Sometimes an intermediate airfield will close owing to bad 
weather, then fuel will not be delivered in time, then people 
will forget to feed the airmen or will not give them an 
opportunity to rest properly. The new bomber is not affected 
either by weather conditions or by the time of day or night. 
  Despite any meteorological conditions, its fundamentally new 
onboard digital computer and other radioelectronic equipment, 
which, incidentally, is duplicated many times over, will 
unerringly bring the aircraft to the prescribed region with an 
accuracy to within one meter. The self-guiding and correcting 
missile and bomb weapons -- the stocks suffice to fulfill any 
tasks -- will hit even a well defended point target. At a range 
from zero to 250 km. 
  But the main "charm" of the new bomber is its cockpit. It is 
as spacious as the flightdeck of a Tu-134 passenger airliner, 
and equipped with air conditioning. The pilot and the navigator 
sit not one behind the other, in tandem, as is usual in any 
two-seater, but side by side. They can get up from their seats, 
stretch their legs, lie down in the aisle between the seats, do 
physical exercises, and then pour borscht from a vacuum flask or 
heat it and sit down to dine. There is even a toilet. 
  Everything has been done on the Su-34, Simonov said, to 
ensure that even after a flight of 1,000 km the airmen are not 
tired and are able to work above the battlefield as though they 
had entered the bomber's cockpit a few minutes previously. 
  The new machine is equipped with an active flight safety 
system or, as it is sometimes called, an artificial intelligence 
system. It enables the plane to execute aerobatic figures at the 
maximum ground speed (equal to 1,400 km per hour) and at the 
lowest altitudes, to unerringly follow the contours of the 
terrain, to hug [ogibat] the ground, and also to easily overcome 
ground forces' air defense weapons. The bomber is as hard to 
detect as a cruise missile, Simonov said. 
  The aircraft is "held" at a certain altitude from the 
ground not only by the digital computer and the active safety 
system -- a forward horizontal fin assembly is fixed to its 
fuselage (it can be seen clearly on the diagram beneath the 
large tapered wings -- author). This parries and suppresses the 
bumpy air which arises with any high-speed aircraft at the 
lowest altitudes and creates additional potential for the pilot 
and navigator to carry out efficient precision bombing, to 
maneuver under enemy fire, to suppress enemy fire weapons, and 
to guard themselves against an enemy missile or a rock face 
suddenly rising up in their path. 
  Moreover, an armored cockpit has been used on the Su-34 for 
the first time in the world, with the possible exception of the 
Su-25 ground-attack aircraft. Its 17mm thickness reliably 
protects the airmen even against chance hits by bullets, shells, 
or shrapnel. 
  Mikhail Petrovich Simonov spared no words in describing the 
new creation of his design bureau. Whereas the Su-24 was 
created, he said, in response to the U.S. F-111 strike bomber, 
willy-nilly resembled it in some of its external features, and 
conveyed a kind of pro-Western image, the Su-34 is unlike 
anything else. It has its own appearance, its own build, its 
own boldness, and its own purely Russian unpredictability. It 
is our own Russian aircraft, which threatens no one but has been 
created for itself and for our own satisfaction. 
  It really would be possible to speak about the new aircraft 
at greater length. True, we cannot present everything here to 
the general public. The majority of the bomber's performance 
characteristics are classified, and our description of it is 
being published only after it has been photographed above the 
deck of the aircraft carrier Admiral Flota Nikolay Kuznetsov and 
photographs of it have appeared in the foreign press with the 
puzzling caption: "What is this? Is Russia deceiving us with 
regard to its weakness?" 
  Incidentally, a recent issue of the British JANE'S DEFENCE 
WEEKLY carried an article devoted to the Sukhoy Experimental 
Design Bureau firm and its aircraft. It was published a few 
days before information on tests of the Su-34. 
  "If the Su-35 (a heavy fighter which flew splendidly at last 
summer's Dubayy Air Show -- author) appears at the Farnborough 
Air Show, as Sukhoy is promising," the magazine writes, "the 
greatest concern will be aroused, so commentators believe, by 
the aspect that it will have taken the West unawares. Their 
very best human and technical intelligence resources bear no 
comparison with Russian craftiness. This at a time when 
everyone reckoned that the former Soviet Union had been brought 
to its knees. If this is so, Russia may have still more 
surprises up its sleeve."

"Military Pensions Being Recalculated"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA of 
31 December 1993, basic pay and pay according to rank is being 
increased by a factor of 1.9 for servicemen in the Russian Armed 
Forces from 1 January 1994 in accordance with a Russian 
Federation Government decree. 
  The Ministry of Defense Main Directorate for the Military 
Budget and Finance announced: The Russian Federation Law On the 
Provision of Pensions to Servicemen (Article 49) and the decree 
of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers/Government of 22 
September 1993, No.941 (Article 14) says: If the monetary 
allowance for servicemen increases, pensions which have been 
previously fixed for discharged servicemen and members of their 
families are also subject to review from the same date. The 
military commissariats have already set about this work. 
  Many people are interested in the current minimum wage 
which, 
as we know, is taken into consideration when reviewing military 
pensions. It stands today at 14,620 rubles.

  [Correspondent N.Kandiashvili] Where does the reality about

his death? [passage omitted -- a Chechen delegation told 
Shevardnadze of the death] 
  Regarding the rumors that he was surrounded by armed

"Vesti," Eduard Shevardnadze said today: 
  [Begin Shevardnadze recording] I categorically deny this 
because we did not plan any military operations, and there was 
no such pursuit. And there was no need for such a thing since 
we considered and we still consider that he is not a serious 
political force. And if indeed he has been killed or has 
committed suicide, I am sincerely hurt. [end recording] 
  [Studio announcer] Gamsakhurdia's representative in Spain, 
(Zhordani), has stated that the former president of Georgia is 
still alive. Zhordani claims that the suicide reports are aimed 
at bringing Gamsakhurdia out of his refuge in Georgia in order 
to arrest him. 
  Valeriya Novodvorskaya, adviser to Zviad Gamsakhurdia, 
expressed her opinion today. 
  [Begin Novodvorskaya recording] I can state quite positively 
that nothing has happened yet. The president of Georgia is 
still alive. We are in constant contact with the president. 
Everyone who knows Zviad can only deride the story about the 
suicide of a deeply religious Christian and a man who bears 
responsibility for his cause and for his country. [end

  [Text] Supporters of deposed Georgian President Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia said he might be alive. 
  A source at the information center of Gamsakhurdia's rebels 
told Interfax that the conclusion was based on a careful 
analysis of the situation, but that the truth would be known 
after several days, for everything depended on whether a reply 
came from Gamsakhurdia himself, to whom an inquiry had been sent. 
  The source said those who had told Gamsakhurdia's wife 
Manana 
about his death had not been to western Georgia for two weeks. 
  The source said the rumors about Gamsakhurdia's suicide had 
apparently been launched by the Georgian leadership and had 
three aims: prepare a basis for his planned assassination, deal 
a mortal blow at the national liberation movement in western 
Georgia, and force Gamsakhurdia's closer relatives to return to 
Georgia in order to, by taking them hostage, force him to 
surrender to the authorities. 
  The source said the plot had had the opposite effect, 
Gamsakhurdia having received more support.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by IPRINDA correspondent Zurab Dvali from </F>
Tbilisi] 
  [Text] Today is exactly two years since the first popularly 
elected Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, together with 
about 50 of his followers, escaped at dawn from his bunker in 
the government house, surrounded by the opposition, and fled 
from the republic. It is 6 January again -- this time 1994, and 
again the destiny of this man is at the center of attention of 
virtually all the local and foreign media. 
  An official delegation lead by Chechen Republic Vice 
President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev arrived in Tbilisi late last 
night. According to information we have, the guests intend to 
investigate all the details connected with Zviad Gamsakhurdia's 
death -- along with examining a whole range of economic, trade, 
and other issues. They have also passed on to the head of the 
Georgian state a request made by the Georgian ex-president's 
wife Manana to allow the body of her husband to be buried in his 
homeland. She means the family cemetery in the grounds of the 
house in Tbilisi that belonged to the ex- president's father. 
Eduard Shevardnadze has declined this request. However, some 
sources claim that the funeral could take place in the 
Gamsakhurdia family home village in western Georgia. 
  It also become known today that Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev has issued an official statement in which he indicates 
that Zviad Gamsakhurdia should be buried in his homeland with 
all the honors that befit the first president of Georgia. In 
connection with this, Dudayev appealed to democratic circles of 
Russia, asking them to put pressure on official Tbilisi. 
  At the same time, the question of whether Gamsakhurdia has 
really shot himself still remains open. At any rate, a doubt 
about this version of events was expressed not only by 
representatives of the special services who, in one way or 
another, were closely following the ex-president's activities 
all this time, but also people who were personally close to 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Anyway, the fact remains -- a man whose 
name was connected at first with the best hopes and aspirations 
of the Georgian people, and who later was accused of every 
mortal sin and proclaimed a chief ideologist of provincial 
fascism and a traitor, is no more. 
  As the saying goes, speak no ill of the dead.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 2030 GMT on 6 January broadcasts an eight minute 
commentary on the report of the death of former Georgian 
President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. 
  The program interspersed its own commentary with the 
reactions and views of interviewees. It did not reveal 
additional information about the circumstances surrounding 
Gamsakhurdia's reported death, nor did it offer further 
confirmations of existing reports. 
  Valerian Advadze, Georgian ambassador to Russia, who was 
interviewed in the Georgian embassy in Moscow, said that he, 
like his colleagues in Tbilisi, had learned about Gamsakhurdia's 
death from the Russian media. Advadze expressed doubt that 
Gamsakhurdia had committed suicide: "With his character he would 
have been unable to kill himself; he would not have had the 
courage." He said he thought it more likely that Gamsakhurdia 
was killed by one of his own entourage. 
  Asked by the announcer whether Gamsakhurdia's death, if it 
had taken place, would be advantageous to the Georgian 
leadership, Advadze replied: "I can firmly state that it would 
have no influence and no significance for either the leadership 
or the people, because he had already shown himself up once and 
for all, and had been dead politically for a long time already. 
There was no chance that he could make another expedition to 
Tbilisi, like the one he launched recently." 
  Continuing his commentary, the announcer expressed the view 
that Gamsakhurdia's death would affect Russian interests, 
referring to Gamsakhurdia's links with Abkhazia and Chechnya. 
However, V. E. Yegoshkin, acting director of the Transcaucasus 
department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told the program 
that Russia's relations with Georgia did not depend on who was 
in power: "Our relations with Georgia and its people do not 
depend on who holds political power in that country. That is 
the internal affairs of the Georgians themselves, and Russia 
sees no point in interfering in Georgia's internal affairs." 
  Finally, the commentator recapped the latest controversy 
over 
Gamsakhurdia's place of burial, adding: "So one way or another, 
almost everyone is ready to bury him. If he is still alive, it 
will be difficult for him to find his place again in this 
rapidly changing world."

  [Text] Tbilisi January 7 TASS -- "So far we have not 
received any concrete facts confirming or denying reports of 
Gamsakhurdia's death and burial in one of the districts of 
western Georgia", Head of the Zugdidi District Administration 
Edisher Chargazia told ITAR- TASS on Friday. 
  Chargazia confirmed that an investigation is underway in the 
Zugdidi district and outlying areas. The investigation is being 
directed by the republic's Deputy Procurator-General Anzor 
Baluashvili. 
  Deputy Chairman of the Provisional Committee for Emergencies 
in Western Georgia Vakhtang Kvaratskhelia told ITAR-TASS that 
the investigative committee left Zugdidi today for the 
neighboring Tsalendzhikhi district, where it will visit two 
villages, Nakipu and Dzhagira. It was in this district that the 
rumor started of Gamsakhurdia's death and burial in one of the 
above-mentioned villages. 
  Kvaratskheliya himself proposes that "Zviad Gamsakhurdia's 
death did not occur in one of the districts of western Georgia, 
but beyond the republic's borders".

  [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev has offered Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia's relatives to bury him in Groznyy. According to 
Interfax sources, Dudayev believes that as Georgia's first 
legally elected president, Gamsakhurdia must be buried with all 
honors. 
  Groznyy's mayor's office told Interfax that requests were 
being made for naming a street in Groznyy after Gamsakhurdia. 
Groznyy's First Vice Mayor Sayid-Magomed Inorkayev said that 
Gamsakhurdia's name would be given to one of the city's most 
beautiful streets. He also said that the city administration 
was ready to organize a funeral ceremony in Groznyy. 
  Earlier, Gamsakhurdia's wife Manana had told Interfax that 
her husband must be buried in Tbilisi, in the courtyard of his 
house, near his father's grave. She doubts, however, that the 
Georgian officials will allow her to do so.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 7 TASS -- Late Thursday evening a 
group of Georgian law enforcement officials took a chartered 
plane out of Tbilisi to Groznyy, capital of the Chechen 
republic, Georgian First Deputy Minister of Security Avtandil 
Ioseliani told ITAR-TASS on Friday. The officials intend to 
meet with the person who first informed Manana Gamsakhurdia and 
the Chechen leadership about the death of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, 
the ousted president of Georgia. The goal of the trip is to 
determine the accuracy of the reports about Gamsakhurdia's death. 
  Ioseliani stressed that the group's fact-finding trip to 
Chechnya became possible due to an agreement reached with a 
delegation from Chechnya, visiting Tbilisi. The Georgian 
officials from the foreign ministry, security ministry, and 
procurator's office left for Groznyy together with the returning 
Chechen delegation.

<F P=106> [Speech by State Council Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze at the </F>
inaugural meeting of the Abkhazia regional branch of the 
Citizen's Union of Georgia at the Rustaveli theater in Tbilisi 
on 5 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] With all my heart and soul I would like to welcome 
the founding of the Abkhazia organization of the Citizens' Union 
of Georgia and to say at the outset that I regard this event as 
a very promising beginning along the way toward achieving our 
common goal and objective which is the victory of justice, that 
is, our dignified return to Abkhazia. Owing to reasons which 
are easy to understand, I have come to you feeling certain 
emotions. It was not easy for me to take this podium because 
the loss of Abkhazia, be it a temporary loss, is a great pain 
for the whole of Georgia and you, in the first place, for your 
friends and relatives, and for all Georgians and non-Georgians 
who have been expelled from Abkhazia. 
  I would like to start by saying I'm sorry. I am the leader 
of this country and I want to tell you frankly that I bear a 
very big share of the responsibility for what has happened, for 
this great disaster and tragedy. Things could have turned out 
differently had all levels of the Georgian leadership been up to 
snuff. We did not enter Abkhazia to fight. One cannot fight in 
one's own country and cannot deploy troops in an area unless 
there is an emergency there. We entered there to establish 
order. Unfortunately, the most difficult and unexpected thing 
has happened. I would like you to include me among the people 
who are now called refugees. Let me assure you that I am 
dreaming of returning to Abkhazia, as does each of you who has 
lost your home. I have the same emotions as each of you. I 
repeat: I consider myself a refugee until you and I return to 
Abkhazia. All my colleagues in the present leadership and the 
Citizens' Union of Georgia feel the same. 
  I profoundly believe that our meeting today and the founding 
of the Abkhazia branch of the Citizens' Union will not simply be 
a formal event. We will become a political force which will 
lead Georgia into a big arena, a force which will guarantee 
Georgia's unity, integrity, the unity of the Georgian people, 
the unity of all people living in Georgia, and it will guarantee 
Georgia's strength and future. If I did not believe in this, I 
would not spend the rest of my years with this organization. I 
profoundly believe in this and I also want you to believe. 
  It was said here quite rightly that the first thing to be 
done in the new year is to establish order in the whole of 
Georgia. First of all, a real Georgian army should be created. 
One of the main reasons for the loss of Abkhazia was our 
failure to create a real Georgian army, a national army. Those 
who were with me there -- I can see that Batoni [honorific 
title] Tamaz is present, as well as many others with whom I 
spent most difficult days, hours, and minutes -- can confirm 
that there was heroism, bravery, selflessness, and sacrifice, 
but I cannot say that there was a Georgian army. It was not an 
army. Judging numerically and qualitatively, if we consider 
each young man individually, judging by equipment and armaments, 
we should not have lost that war. Unfortunately, we lost it 
because there was no single and well- organized force. 
  In my short New Year's interview, I said that one of our 
priority tasks is to create a Georgian army in the next few 
months, in the next two or three months. The material and the 
means to do it exist. The main thing is to ensure good 
organization. As the head of state and the commander in chief 
of our army, I want to assure you that I will do everything to 
have such an army in Georgia. It is not accidental that I am 
saying this. Why I am saying this I will tell you towards the 
end. 
  The disaster which has befallen us was not accidental. I 
want 
us to look with self-criticism into our affairs and life. We 
have made so many errors. Did we not create a terrible 
phenomenon of modern times which is provincial fascism? I often 
say this and will often repeat it in future. We ourselves 
brought fascism, fascist forces, to power. We inculcated this 
ideology for several years. There will be a congress of the 
Citizens' Union of Georgia where we will show the whole country 
how this terrible disease was gaining ground in Georgia 
ideologically, psychologically, and philosophically. 
  I have recently asked my colleagues to select some 
newspapers, brochures, and books published at the time, so that 
I could leaf through them. They go even further than Hitler's 
Mein Kampf. And this was happening here in Georgia. And we were 
applauding this. Eighty-seven percent voted for this fascism. We 
were punished. We should have been punished and were punished. 
  The same fascism took root in Abkhazia. Even a worse brand 
of 
fascism. If provincial fascism had not existed here, then the 
Ardzinba regime would not have dominated Abkhazia. Our fascism 
legitimized that terrible electoral law which in practice meant 
apartheid, one nation oppressing another and the discrimination 
of one nation by another. This was fascism at work in Georgia. 
  This was followed by everything we have witnessed, the 
executions, including Zhiuli Shartava [chairman of the Council 
of Ministers of Abkhazia, who was killed in September 1993], the 
town mayor... [70 second loss of reception] 
  We were robbing them, is it true or not? Unfortunately, all 
this has happened. 
  Let us also remember how we drove Ossetians out of Tbilisi. 
After all, these people made up only one or two percent of the 
population here. You remember how we drove them out, how we 
fired and dismissed them from jobs, how we evicted them from 
their homes. And now they are living in the northern Caucasus. 
These were people who had been brought up in Georgian schools. 
Many of them wrote poems and stories in Georgian, worked in our 
laboratories and were engaged in work. I was brought up and have 
worked with many of them. They were wonderful people. How could 
we have expelled them from here? How could we have expelled 
them from the Borjomi gorge [in southern Georgia]. This was one 
of the areas known for its fertile land and hard-working people. 
Like gendarmes they [Georgians] took them and expelled them, 
and now these people are sheltering somewhere. How we tortured 
Ossetians. They also tortured Georgians, but how we tortured 
Ossetians. How we gouged out their eyes. How we committed 
terrible deeds. Was it fascism or not? Yes, it was. 
  This fascism gave Ardzinba that electoral law. It agreed 
with his aspirations. Therefore, we must say, as I said in my 
New Year's interview, that the year 1993 was, in a way, a year 
of purification. This purification must continue. We, the 
Georgian people, must be purified of sins. The sins which have 
been committed must be admitted. God will only be on the side 
of an honest man, an honest people and nation. This is a law of 
history and this is a lesson of history. 
  I think that we have swallowed a lot of bitter pills in our 
life, and 1992 and 1993 were years of drawing conclusions from 
bitter lessons. We have committed many other sins. We want all 
this to be discussed at the congress of our union. It will be 
discussed in a manly, direct, and resolute manner. If we do 
this, the Citizens' Union will become established in our society 
and will be a guarantor of our country's future. 
  We are making grave mistakes even today and I think this 
must 
also be mentioned. Most of you are now living in Tbilisi. I am 
not talking about hardship. It has affected everyone, both the 
refugees and locals. I know about many cases of people starving 
to death. It is difficult to imagine a disaster greater than 
that. However, let us talk about the New Year. Things are 
gradually improving but the New Year's fun was killed by endless 
shooting on New Year's eve. They were shooting from cannons, 
self-made guns, rifles, machine gun, from everything. One might 
think that it was the end, or, rather, the beginning of the 
storming of Berlin, or, rather, that the Berlin operation was 
under way. It was terrible. 
  I think that in a short while we will restore the kind of 
order which will allow the whole world to say that it is 
possible in Georgia, or, rather, that normal people live in 
Georgia. We are tarnishing our reputation by doing this. 
[applause] 
  It was a terrible night. The new year is a time of joy, but 
this time it was terrible. 
  At a meeting with people of Tbilisi I said that those who 
are 
confronting us, regardless of their rank, reputation -- and I am 
not speaking here about illegal armed formations whom I have 
already challenged to fight a duel -- will not be forgiven. 
This disaster will be over. [applause] 
  Reclaiming Abkhazia starts in Tbilisi, reclaiming Abkhazia 
starts in Samegrelo. I shall tell you one more truth. Had we not 
made so many mistakes in Samegrelo [Mengrelia], had we not given 
away Samegrelo to those people who did not deserve it, then 
nothing would have happened to Abkhazia, we would not have lost 
Abkhazia. Samegrelo was, in effect lost for Georgia and she was 
paralyzed. This is what Samegrelo means to Georgia. And you know 
what, the most difficult days...[pauses], I have the right to 
say that I am one of the refugees. I did not leave Sukhumi for 
one moment even when we seemingly gained a victory in the month 
of March nor when we were being defeated. Many of you probably 
left [Sukhumi] at the end and I was one of those people who 
escaped in the nick of time. To tell you the truth, I was 
dreaming of not leaving it [Sukhumi]. It just did not work out. 
I still think I was right to leave. But I witnessed...[pauses] 
When we had the biggest crisis, we should not have been 
defeated. We had everything that we needed: manpower, arms, and 
the population of Sukhumi was disposed to fight, but units after 
units disengaged themselves from combat posts. There are people 
from Sukhumi, they will confirm it. Is it not true? They used to 
disengage themselves and flee. 
  I shall not forget one session. We used to gather every 
night 
at 0200 and sum up the day's results until 0300 to 0400. I shall 
never forget this session. I shall not give away the name of the 
young man, he may not be alive or perhaps he is hiding in 
mountains; the Sukhumi funicular, the key strategic center -- if 
it is within your view then you control Sukhumi -- a 60 to 
70-strong unit was standing there. I asked at the session what 
the situation was like at the funicular. The leader got up and 
told me, do not worry, everything is well, it is guarded safely. 
The next morning, before the dawn, at 0500, I was told that the 
unit had disengaged itself and left the funicular. In half an 
hour mountain peoples and others went up there and occupied the 
funicular. Thirty-five of the best youths fell in the battles to 
recapture the funicular, but in vain, because it had already 
been captured by others and it was the beginning of the fall of 
Sukhumi. 
  Battalion after battalion used to disengage themselves from 
combat positions and at the end as we had no other option. Jaba 
Ioseliani, myself and two or three more men, we were begging 
with our hands up -- I cannot use a gun, I am not a shooter -- 
standing in the street: Please, units, get back, get back -- 
but they were fleeing like a flock of sheep. 
  What had happened? Why were they fleeing? Because there was 
an order from the ex-president, if Sukhumi falls, Shevardnadze's 
government will fall too. Is it not a betrayal? That is why I 
am saying that we must look into our hearts, our sins, our 
misfortune. Had we been united, a united Georgia, or had Loti 
Kobalia come in good time -- we had given him arms; Kitovani and 
others had given him and others three-fourths of the arms; they 
had given them everything there was, they were armed to the 
teeth and he did not budge. It was so easy to cross the Kodori 
river, there were only 1,500 men there. Karkarashvili had 
crossed over and back. They [Kobalia and his army] did not want 
to cross over. They were dreaming that Sukhumi would fall and 
they would come back to power. It is a dirty careerism. It is 
authentic fascism. It was the real cause. 
  Of course, there was a betrayal from Russia's reactionary 
forces which helped the rebels, supplied them with arms and 
plans but despite all this, Sukhumi would not have fallen by any 
means, had it not been for the betrayal. 
  Citizens' Union of Georgia must become the force which will 
tell everybody the truth, whenever, whatever the difficulties 
may be, however unpalatable the truth may be, it will tell the 
truth and it is for the first time that I am telling the truth 
about the Sukhumi disaster. 
  The key cause lies in ourselves, our betrayal, the dual 
nature and the duplicity of some Georgians who had allowed the 
unity of the country, the fate of the country, the salvation of 
Sukhumi and Abkhazia for the fall of a dream for a career. This 
is the trouble. 
  You know, we have been punished but not forever. They are 
dead ringers, like the two drops of water, the only difference 
being in the fact that in the first instance the matter is 
Abkhazians and in the second one it is Georgians. This is what 
the ideological preparation was like for what became to be known 
as the Abkhaz tragedy and disaster as well as the tragedy which 
had taken place in Georgia. 
  I am saying all this because the session of the Citizens' 
Union of Georgia is analyzing everything now and will tell the 
truth, the whole truth. 
  Georgia is now once again in the limelight not only because 
of the Sukhumi affair previously and other events; it is once 
again in the limelight. Why? Because fascism as such, is 
emerging as an event not only in one small corner and country 
but also on a larger scale. 
  The fascist force has come to the fore in Russia. When I was 
in Ashgabat, I felt a terrible alarm by the leaders of 
Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Moldova, Uzbekistan, our neighbors, and 
many others who were voicing a big fear over the emerging of the 
fascist force so boldly, obviously, in such an up-front manner, 
so unexpectedly in the arena. When they looked around, they 
said that Georgia had the greatest and most interesting 
experience in fighting fascism. 
  I said then and I say now that we have sorted out our 
fascism, we have defeated our fascism and now we must all unite 
in the CIS so that fascism does not win in Russia. If fascism 
were to win in Russia, it will be the burial of not only Russia, 
but Georgia as well. It will be a disaster. We shall not be 
able to stay away from these processes. 
  Therefore, the example of our fight, I do not mean only a 
physical fight, literally, but an ideological fight as well; and 
destroying fascism is our duty as it will help everybody. 
Fascism is one of the greatest dangers for the today's world in 
the same way as is separatism about which I used to talk much 
before and am still talking. 
  They have comprehended in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and other 
countries that separatism is charged with an equally explosive 
bomb as an atomic one. They have just comprehended it. Can you 
imagine what will happen in Kazakhstan where it is 40 percent 
Kazakh and 60 percent other nationalities? What will happen if 
separatism spreads its wings there? Or what will happen in 
Ukraine where there are 15 million people of other nationalities 
and at that in the best organized and highly developed regions? 
What will happen if separatism is revived there as well as in 
other countries? Here, too, although bitter but still, an 
experience of fighting separatism has been accumulated in 
Georgia. I mean aggressive, fascist separatism but all this is 
the past. 
  We must still talk about today and tomorrow. I have said 
already and it is my analysis, not just an accidental phrase 
that the year 1994 must become the year of the beginning of a 
great turn, a turn towards progress, it must become the year of 
a serious turn. I have confidence. This is the result of our 
analysis and the conclusion from that analysis. 
  When proving this, I am also pinning hopes on the formation 
of such a strong political force as the Citizen' Union of 
Georgia. I trust that the Citizens' Union will be able to offer 
the public and Georgia solutions for the crisis. It must happen 
at our congress which will probably take place in February: how 
to bring Georgia out of the economic and political crisis, the 
social hardship and many other disasters that descended on us. 
There are solutions for it. The main thing is to find these 
ways properly and show people that we are not predestined, that 
the situation is not that hopeless; and that if we do not give 
up, if we get down to work and choose proper ways, there are 
solutions and the country will be saved. I hope that the 
citizens' Union will be the very political force which will 
create such a program and present it to the public. 
  The Citizens' Union, as I have already told you, will 
present to the public an analysis of the events which took place 
in recent years. It will be a serious analysis and serious 
summary. The Citizens' Union must manage -- and I am sure we 
shall all unite in order to achieve this -- to offer the public 
the program of restoring justice in Abkhazia and returning to 
Abkhazia; not by using slogans, demagogy, populist appeals and 
drumming more support and creating a heroic name for oneself and 
so on, but a realistic, scientific program for reclaiming 
Abkhazia. I am sure we shall manage it. 
  I have said many times and I am repeating once again that 
there are two solutions. They were there before and remain in 
force now. There are two solutions. We cannot afford refusing 
political means for settling the conflict, if they [political 
means] correspond to our interests. I know the disposition of 
some of you. Please, do not take offense if I am say this 
because several times our hopes had been dashed and it cost us 
very dear, the aftermath was grave. Still, life keeps changing, 
there are slightly different conditions now. International 
organizations are more active and there are more hopes for their 
support. We have new friends, Georgia has new friends -- they 
have emerged, supervisors and observers of this process -- the 
United States of America, France, the Federal Republic of 
Germany, and Russia simultaneously with those negotiations held 
under the auspices of the UN. 
  Deep in my heart I believe that Russia herself, in the long 
run, has been assured; anyway this is my impression judging from 
the conversation with the president, that Georgia's losing 
Abkhazia means the beginning of Russia's disintegration. 
  I had been saying this for a long time before but 
unfortunately not everybody heard it and failed to hear it 
properly. If Russia were to follow democracy and the Russian 
president assured all of us -- the leaders of the CIS countries 
-- that there was no other solution and Russia's current 
constitution provides with a possibility that Russia will 
develop in a democratic way, then Russia must become our ally in 
reclaiming Abkhazia. 
  Our first and foremost task is the speediest return of all 
refugees. As soon as the refugees return, as soon as everybody 
returns to their homes -- some houses had been burned to the 
ground, some survived, most of them have been looted and 
destroyed, we shall still restore them, all of us, together -- 
then the Abkhaz issue will be resolved because then, only 
elections must follow it and you know very well what the results 
of the elections will be. 
  There are other terms as well. I consider joining the CIS as 
one of the important events. Let them say whatever they please 
and smirk wickedly, I still think that I was the first to have 
taken this step. I am right in my choice. I have not made a 
mistake and in Ashgabat I got assured once again that my 
colleagues and myself and those who think in the same way as I 
do, those who share my point of view, that we are right. We 
have not made a mistake. 
  At the closed session of the heads of states it was said 
that 
the CIS would be a viable organism only if it creates 
appropriate guarantees for the territorial integrity and the 
stability of the countries. A specific mechanism has already 
been created, it is being created. There is such a phrase in 
the document which all of us signed together, we all signed it 
unanimously. 
  This is one of the guarantees that the situation will 
change. 
  I must say that many countries did not understand our stance 
in connection with Abkhazia at the beginning stage, especially 
the central Asian countries; there was a misinterpretation in 
the beginning in Ukraine, and in Russia, of course. Today, as 
everybody has already seen what aggressive separatism means in 
reality and in action, nearly all these countries are on 
Georgia's side. It is a very important event; not to mention 
anything about the world support. 
  Friends, we all owe -- and I am not saying it in order to 
just pay tribute -- we really owe the refugees. We know how 
hard it is for you and even more for those who are not here, who 
could not come. I know all about it very well. Probably we 
must settle whatever needs settling. Unfortunately the coupon 
has no value but we must still double, triple the payment so 
that people heave a little sigh of relief and humanitarian aid 
will be reinforced. I shall have the possibility to specially 
summon the vice-premier, Batoni Irakli Menagharishvili -- many 
of you know him. I have delegated to him to create a system 
which would be just so that not a single gram of medicine or 
food be lost and that it reaches refugees in the form in which 
it is sent from the United States, France, Iran, Israel, 
Germany, and other countries. There will be a little help in 
the immediate future. 
  Many organizations are being established abroad whose aim is 
to save Georgia and her democracy. You know that the former 
secretaries of state, Shultz and Baker, have set up such an 
organization which includes quite influential people. Former 
President Carter expressed the wish to become an honorary 
chairman of the organization. A movement is starting in the 
Federal Republic of Germany and so on. But I think that by the 
time they do their job, we shall have returned to Abkhazia. 
  There is one threat... [pauses] Maybe as a nickname, we 
shall 
call the Citizens' Union the organization for returning to 
Abkhazia. This threat, as they say, has been inborn with our 
people and it is still there -- the split. There is no time for 
anybody's ambitions. Let nobody seek and attempt drumming up 
popularity at the expense of the people who are living in 
hardship, let nobody attempt it. 
  I think that all of you who are present must agree with me 
that there are two ways. I told you about one way. There is 
another way. It is not accidental that I started to talk about 
creating an army, a real army, an army which will not desert 
positions without an order from the commander in chief. If 
necessary, it will die, but will never retreat. Unless there is 
such an army, the other way, the way of a military solution is 
very difficult. We can talk endlessly that there is only a 
military solution, but we will achieve nothing without a real 
force, unless there is a real army which has been trained 
morally, psychologically, and militarily. Such an army is being 
created. Work to achieve this is under way. A little time is 
necessary. However, I want you to know that this is still on the 
agenda. People who are calling on the Georgians to arm 
themselves and go today are wrong because it is not so easy. All 
this is in the center of our attention and we are working to 
achieve this. 
  I think that in 10 or 15 days you will learn about some of 
the measures which will lead us to the creation of an army that 
will fight until the last drop of blood and achieve its task. 
[applause]] 
  A few more words now. I welcome...[pauses] I wanted Batoni 
Lorik Marshania [ethnic Abkhazian who was in the pro-Georgian 
Abkhazian government] to be with us today but he is away on a 
special assignment. I am very glad that his daughter, Kalbatoni 
[honorific title] Ada, delivered a speech. She did it in a very 
good, clever, and resolute manner. You know that her father and 
herself had to share the same fortune with each of you, and with 
us. It is good that there are Abkhazians among us. There are 
many Abkhazians in Moscow, Kiev, Sochi, and other towns with 
whom I am maintaining ties and I will never break these ties. I 
believe that the Abkhazians who have the right position are our 
brothers, they are and will remain our flesh and blood. We will 
live together. This is a law. I do not have in mind here one or 
two people or the group which has led us to this disaster. 
  I have said it before and, on behalf of our union, I will 
state again at this meeting that the democratic state of Georgia 
binds itself to guarantee not only the preservation, but also 
the development of the national identity of the Abkhazians and 
Ossetians. This may be in the form of autonomy or another form 
of statehood. We will together arrive at a decision which will 
be acceptable for the Georgians, Abkhazians, Ossetians, and 
other peoples. We give them a full guarantee of human rights 
protection and full equality in our free, independent, and 
democratic Georgia. Everybody should know and understand this. 
  We, the Georgians, are a hot-tempered people, but we are 
also 
a generous people. We will return to Abkhazia, however, we will 
return not for new bloodshed or vengeance, but to restore the 
justice of history, so that Georgians live together with 
Abkhazians and other peoples on that land and so that our 
children and grandchildren build a better and more beautiful 
Abkhazia within Georgia. 
  And this is how I would like to finish. It is possible that, 
-- one group has told me this recently, so it is not my own idea 
-- it is possible that a political process will not bring us the 
necessary result. The creation of an army may be delayed, which 
may result in other negative aspects. Your apartments and homes 
in Abkhazia are being misappropriated. 
  I would not rule out that the whole of Georgia will rise. I 
want this to be broadcast by television and to reach the UN and 
all other organizations. The whole of Georgia will rise. I 
will lead it. It would be hundreds of thousands, millions of 
people. They may be unarmed. We will start from the Inguri 
River -- there will be hundreds of thousands, millions -- and we 
will reach the Psou River. Even if we are unarmed. 
  This would be an unprecedented march, such as the world has 
never heard of. It would be a demonstration of the Georgians' 
will. The whole world will learn who and what the Georgians 
are. Half of us could perish. That is possible. But nothing 
is more supreme and sacred for us, including the Union of 
Georgian Citizens, than Georgia's unity, integrity, and happy 
future. 
  This is how I would like to finish my speech.

<F P=106> [Article by Tamaz Mchedlidze: "The Parliamentary Majority Is </F>
a Pro-Russian Force"] 
  [Text] Irakli Tsereteli, chairman of the National 
Independence Party, has assessed 1993 as a year characterized by 
failures of every kind, beginning with the loss of Abkhazia and 
ending with entry into the CIS. In his view, a coalition 
government has to be formed, which will unite forces opposed to 
the CIS. Tsereteli believes that it is impermissible to hold 
elections without Abkhazia. Therefore, a new government has to 
be formed on the basis of its attitude toward the CIS. 
  "The present parliamentary majority is a pro-Russian force 
and consequently did not block the illegal decision of the head 
of state. Joining the CIS contradicts the acts of 26 May 1918 
and 9 April 1991 [on the declaration of Georgia's independence]. 
In this way, the present government has abolished itself." 
  In the view of Irakli Tsereteli, there is no party existing 
in Georgia today that can form a government. Therefore, 
national forces should govern the state together. 
  Tsereteli assessed the Geneva negotiations [on settlement of 
the Abkhazian conflict] as fruitless and a shameful fact.

<F P=106> [Article by Soso Zaalishvili: "Giorgi Chanturia: </F>
`Gamsakhurdia's Return Would Have Been Preferable to the 
Occupation of Samegrelo by Russian Forces'"] 
  [Text] Giorgi Chanturia, chairman of the 
National-Democratic Party [NDP], called 1993 the year of the 
total failure of state policy. In his view, Russia forced 
Shevardnadze to change his Western orientation. 
  According to Chanturia, there is a big difference between 
Eduard Shevardnadze as he was at the time of the expulsion of 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia and now as head of state. The head of state 
is conducting non-Georgian policies today. If anyone should 
fear the return of Gamsakhurdia, it is his family. However, the 
return of the ex-president would have been preferable to the 
partial destruction of his supporters and to Samegrelo's 
[Mingrelia] abandonment as a zone under virtual Russian 
occupation as, in these conditions, everything would have been 
given its proper name. In our case, Western countries gave a 
very negative assessment of the use of Russian troops against 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia's supporters in western Georgia. As a result 
of this decision, Shevardnadze has permanently distanced himself 
from the West. 
  Giorgi Chanturia believes that Interior Minister Igor 
Giorgadze has been sent to Georgia by the Russian special 
services in order to neutralize the head of state himself. 
  In the view of the NDP leader, the NDP is the only real 
force 
in Georgia today that supports Georgian statehood. Chanturia 
did not participate in the 11 October elections as he did not 
consider it was necessary at that time to become head of state. 
However, he now fears that, in spite of his reluctance, he will 
have to participate in the elections that are expected to be 
held in the spring. In the event of his victory, Giorgi 
Chanturia has promised us that he will establish order in one 
month but he does not know how to deal with the economy. 
  So, the National-Democrats have finally distanced themselves 
from the former [Soviet] foreign minister whom they brought to 
Georgia. It is interesting to know who will follow their example 
next year.

  [Text] Abkhazia's Justice Ministry, temporarily based in 
Tbilisi, has evaluated the referendum on the legal status of 
this autonomous republic as a political farce. 
  The Justice Ministry's statement, distributed on Thursday, 
says that the aim of this measure is "to announce Abkhazia as a 
sovereign state" despite the UN and Security Council decisions. 
(As is known, their resolutions reconfirm Georgia's sovereignty 
and territorial integrity.) 
  "The intention to hold a referendum at a time when ethnic 
cleansing and genocide of the Georgian population are underway 
in Abkhazia is cynical," underlines the statement. 
  To this effect the ministry declared that "according to 
Georgia's laws and norms of international law, results of this 
referendum will have no legal force."

  [Text] Tbilisi January 6 GIA-TASS -- The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Georgia today issued a statement criticizing 
Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba for his announcement broadcast 
by radio that he felt "pretty skeptical" about the 
Georgian-Abkhaz consultations scheduled for January 11 in Geneva. 
  According to the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these 
words of Ardzinba "testify not only to his skepticism but also 
to his intention to poison the atmosphere around the forthcoming 
talks and even to disrupt them as far as possible". 
  This assumption is borne out by Ardzinba's reiterated 
statement that "Abkhazia is no longer part of Georgia" and that 
"the question now is about signing an agreement between Abkhazia 
and Georgia as two equal parties". 
  A second round of consultations between Georgia and Abkhazia 
is scheduled to begin in Geneva on January 11. "The delegation 
from Georgia has been instructed to draw up, jointly with the 
Abkhaz delegation, a framework for the full-scale settlement in 
Abkhazia, which can be used as the basis of a resolution to be 
adopted by the United Nations Security Council," the Georgian 
statement said. 
  "Only a document recognised and guaranteed by the 
international community can ensure the restoration of peace in 
Abkhazia," the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

<F P=106> [Vladislav Drobkov report: "What Will Bill Clinton Bring to </F>
Moscow? Once Again the U.S. Delegation's Baggage Contains More 
Advice and Political Declarations Than Specific Economic 
Programs or, Most Importantly, Funds To Implement Them"] 
  [Text] Washington, 10 Jan -- U.S. President Bill Clinton 
will fly into Moscow on the evening of 12 January. The agenda 
for the greeting ceremony and for Clinton's entire first 
official visit to Russia has been prearranged in great detail. 
Supper with B. Yeltsin at the presidential dacha, talks in the 
Kremlin, a trip to the Danilov Monastery, a reception at the 
U.S. ambassador's residence.... The places and the exact times 
of all the meetings and talks have been decided. 
  In recent days the U.S. press has devoted considerable 
attention to the upcoming talks and to the whole package of 
relations between our two states. I have talked with many 
political experts, commentators, journalists, and entrepreneurs 
here and with "high-ranking representatives of the 
administration" who traditionally wish to remain anonymous. As 
a rule, they have all attached great significance to the 
upcoming visit and hoped that it will help to determine the path 
for the development of Russian-U.S. ties. 
  At the same time both official spokesmen and the press have 
been unable to conceal the existence of serious problems in our 
relations. They have said that many Americans are unclear about 
the details of the changing political and social situation in 
Russia. 
  Commenting on the results of the elections to the Duma and 
the Federal Assembly, Sovietologists and Russian experts here -- 
from journalists to scientists and officials -- have been 
obsessed, as it were, by the figure of V. Zhirinovskiy, who 
suddenly pushed President Yeltsin himself into the background on 
the Russian political horizon. Clinton promised in advance not 
to meet with Zhirinovskiy. But then he seemed to regret his 
blurted assurance, since U.S. mass information channels at once 
carried caustic retorts from Vladimir Volfovich accusing the 
U.S. President of cowardice. 
  It has to be said that, in general, the U.S. reaction to the 
Russian elections still bears the imprint of perplexity and 
vagueness -- leading, so it seems to me, to serious tactical 
errors. Such, in my view, was Clinton's recent statement that 
Russia should not put the brakes on but "continue the policy of 
reforms" with the same persistence. And the United States in 
turn should "redouble efforts" to assist these reforms. 
  Such provisos can only reinforce suspicions that the 
reforms, 
in the form in which they have so far been implemented, are 
advantageous to the United States rather than to Russia. This 
is not to mention the fact that Clinton's statement struck a 
discordant note against the statements by Yeltsin and by V. 
Chernomyrdin, who are receiving him in Moscow, on the need to 
revise the reforms' course and speed of implementation and 
urgently amend the "shock therapy." 
  To judge from this and certain other statements by leading 
figures in the Washington administration, people in the United 
States still find it difficult to answer the question of where 
Russia is going. 
  The NATO Council session in Brussels, preceding the Moscow 
talks, will have been a factor of considerable importance 
determining the substance and tone of this top-level meeting. 
The attempt which Clinton made there to direct the evolution of 
the North Atlantic alliance into the channel of the "Partnership 
for Peace" doctrine, which has still not been formulated 
sufficiently distinctly, attests that Washington does not wish 
to offend Russia too overtly by hastily receiving into the bloc 
the East European and even certain Baltic countries which are 
knocking on its doors. 
  The picture of Russian-U.S. cooperation in the security 
sphere appears far from brilliant. Because of continuing 
sabotage by Kiev, the START I Treaty has still not been ratified 
by all the parties to it. This in turn is blocking the 
fulfillment of the next important agreement in the sphere of 
reducing strategic arms -- START II. 
  One more problem could arise because of the alarm caused in 
the United States by Russia's new military doctrine, which 
provides for the maintenance of an army of more than 2 million 
men and the possibility, so it is believed here, of its being 
used to protect Russian interests in the former Soviet 
republics. The United States is really concerned about such a 
manifestation of the "imperial ambitions" of Russian generals, 
although the White House and the State Department are trying to 
damp down this alarm. Attempts have even been made here to 
essentially repudiate certain statements by Russian Defense 
Minister P. Grachev. 
  It is not entirely clear how and at whose expense the 
program 
of joint maneuvers by U.S. and Russian military units will be 
implemented. The money allocated by the U.S. Congress to assist 
in the matter of destroying the nuclear arms being reduced under 
joint treaties and agreements is not being used. A derisorily 
small sum -- just a few million dollars -- has so far been spent 
on the widely publicized U.S. assistance in the sphere of 
constructing housing for Russian servicemen and their families. 
It is noteworthy that U.S. companies have refused to construct 
houses in Russia for such a pittance. True, there are now 
reports of the future allocation of considerably larger sums.... 
  It is obvious that both in the case of the "Partnership for 
Peace" within the NATO framework and in cooperation with Russia 
on questions of security Washington does not yet have a 
definite, clear-cut program or a clear strategy. There is only 
the desire to secure the U.S. leadership position, as the only 
military superpower, and to accelerate the nuclear disarmament 
of its former "No. 1 rival." 
  Now, so it seems to me, only decisive, major, and effective 
steps by the U.S. Administration for the specific revival of the 
Russian economy are capable of saving the pretty-well undermined 
prestige of U.S. and Western "aid" in general to Russia. 
  Matters have reached the point where last year Russia found 
itself unable to pay even for subsidized U.S. grain, which for 
long years was the most impressive heading under "aid" from 
abroad. In the opinion of many economists, it is precisely this 
"grain fix," like a narcotic, that has shattered the health of 
Russian national agricultural production. 
  Once again the U.S. delegation's baggage contains more 
advice 
and political declarations than specific economic programs or, 
most importantly, funds to implement them. 
  New aid initiatives for Russia should not be expected from 
the visit, THE WASHINGTON POST warns. Impressive new economic 
aid programs will hardly be announced in Moscow, other 
newspapers echo it. 
  In vain have I spent several weeks asking "high-ranking 
representatives" to report on specific new initiatives or 
agreements which have been prepared and which will be discussed 
by the U.S. and Russian presidents at their talks in Moscow. 
Nor have I managed to obtain a detailed answer to the question 
of how the large-scale joint projects already announced are 
being implemented. Although it is maintained here that the 
first $1 billion of the "Vancouver package" of $1.6 billion has 
already been distributed. 
  Nevertheless, we know that it has not yet been possible to 
start implementing even many of the financial aid programs 
already promised to Russia. This applies in particular to the 
ambitious $3 billion privatization aid fund. U.S. 
Administration staff admitted recently that this fund has not 
yet secured the necessary money. Nor has Russia succeeded in 
obtaining much of the $2.5 billion in additional aid allocated 
by Congress after the Clinton-Yeltsin Vancouver meeting. 
  I would like to hope that in the talks the two presidents 
and 
the other participants in the dialogue between the two great 
powers will be able to find the way to really fill their 
relations with specific, businesslike substance. 
  It seems to me that this alone is capable of ensuring the 
long-term interests of Russia's cooperation with the United 
States. The United States still has to prove that the 
statements frequently proclaimed in Washington about our 
relations' shifting from the period of coexistence to an epoch 
of partnership will be backed up by specific deeds and decisions.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev article: "U.S. President Coming to Moscow </F>
To Support Russian Reforms"] 
  [Text] Here's a joke. Bill and Hillary Clinton are 
driving down a country road. They stop to fill up. "Hey," says 
Hillary, looking at the pump attendant, "I know that guy.... 
He's someone I used to date at school." "So if you'd married 
him," Bill replies, "you'd be filling someone's car up now too." 
"No," Hillary objects confidently, "that guy'd be president." 
  There are not very many people in the United States who 
would 
argue that without Hillary, without her ambition, without her 
fierce self-discipline, and without her brilliant political 
instinct enabling her to recognize not so much current as future 
enemies and friends -- without all this Bill would most probably 
have remained a provincial politician, even if he had managed to 
make it to Washington by becoming, for instance, senator for his 
native Arkansas. 
  It is said -- and this is the truth, not a joke -- that 
Clinton's daughter Chelsea phoned the White House from her 
Washington school to check with her parents on whether 
"America's first child" was allowed to have some injections. 
They went straight to the President, as Chelsea had 
recommended, citing the fact that "Mommy's always busy, so it's 
better to ask Daddy." 
  But both Bill and Hillary are workaholics able to work late 
into the night and start again early next morning. I would note 
that in this sense Washington is a rather strange town. Press 
conferences starting at seven or seven-thirty are a tradition 
here rather than a rarity. 
  It is hard to be U.S. President without being a workaholic 
-- 
although it is possible. One need only recall Ronald Reagan, 
one of the most successful presidents of this century -- 
successful in the sense that he fundamentally carried out, and 
even exceeded, his agenda which, I would recall, combined a 
policy of exhausting and shaking up the Soviet empire while 
simultaneously building up America's prosperity. But this same 
Reagan had a truly legendary capacity to snooze through Cabinet 
sessions and limit his working day to four or, at most, five 
hours of normal presidential activity, devoting the rest of his 
time to pleasant pursuits such as riding or talking with his 
wife Nancy. 
  But Reagan had a surprising ability -- he was excellent at 
delegating. This ability is almost an art -- few politicians or 
statesmen have it. Those who do almost always win -- they can 
focus seriously and thoroughly on the main, strategic, long-term 
issues, while letting their ministers, advisers, and other 
clerks handle the details. 
  One of Bill Clinton's problems, which was evident almost as 
soon as he became President, is his insatiable need to decide a 
lot -- if not everything -- himself. Which, incidentally, was a 
characteristic of one of Clinton's predecessors -- the 
Democratic President Jimmy Carter. He himself decided which of 
his advisers and aides would play at what times and how often on 
the White House tennis courts. Any independence for the clerks 
was completely ruled out. 
  Carter often lost sight of what was important in a mass of 
trivia. Not for nothing is his presidency (while undoubtedly 
burdened by objective factors such as the very serious world 
energy crisis) considered one of the weakest in America's recent 
history -- symbolized by the crushing and tragic failure of the 
attempt to free the American hostages held in revolutionary 
Iran. Carter took part at first hand in the job of working out 
the rescue mission -- which required excellent military 
knowledge -- often "knocking down" the opinions of genuine 
specialists. 
  Clinton too plunged into the job straight after the day in 
1992 when the presidential election left him victorious over his 
rival -- the Republican George Bush. Bill took on everything, 
quite forgetting that he was no longer governor of Arkansas but 
the president of a superpower where the budget for military 
bands is more than some other countries' state budgets.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Clinton Not Averse to Talking </F>
With Yeltsin in a Small Group"] 
  [Text] Washington -- "There have been no zigzags in our 
attitude toward Russia," Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary 
of state, said in an interview with IZVESTIYA's correspondent on 
the eve of President Bill Clinton's trip to Russia. "We have 
not been backtracking or wavering. We have simply taken a short 
breather to study the results of the 12 December elections and 
to be sure that we have understood them correctly." 
  Even after his appointment to the number two job at the 
State 
Department, Strobe Talbott retains his position as architect of 
policy on the CIS countries. 
  Critics consider Talbott's erroneous forecast of the Russian 
Duma election results to have been a blunder. 
  "What happened 12 December was something we had not 
expected," Talbott admits. "But I do not think many Russians 
expected it either.... Our policy needed clarification. This 
has been done." 
  This interview took place on the eve of President Bill 
Clinton's departure for Europe. Certain critics have rebuked 
the presidential team for leaving some important tour issues 
unresolved until the last minute -- from the vague proposals on 
Bosnia to the question of whether or not representatives of 
pro-Communist factions in the new Russian parliament should be 
invited to the reception at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. 
  But Talbott clearly hinted that the United States has 
already 
gotten over its analytical pause, has cleared up its conceptual 
blank spots, and is again relying on a consistent program -- 
"although nobody is ever 100-percent happy." 
  Using very cautious expressions and invariably accompanying 
his conclusions with riders to the effect that "it is not for a 
U.S. official to give Russian citizens and Russian leaders 
directions about how they should run their economy or their 
policy," Strobe Talbott gives two main reasons for the 
pro-government blocs' election failure. 
  "No democracy can fail to be concerned about how humane the 
government appears to its citizens. All U.S. presidents have to 
be concerned about this. Leaders may be sincerely convinced 
that everything they do is exclusively in people's interests. 
It may even be directly in people's interests. Nonetheless, 
leaders need public support. If a leader and his policy do not 
meet with society's support, they will fail. This is not such a 
big message, but we want to bring it to the Russian side's 
attention, because it is the truth about how a democracy works." 
  The second reason for the Russian Government's difficulties, 
Talbott believes, lies in the means used to implement the 
economic reforms. 
  "I have learned from the Russian press that a considerable 
number of those who voted for the Liberal Democratic Party were 
middle-aged people scared of losing their jobs. But this is 
something with which we are very familiar." 
  Strobe Talbott said that certain observers had attached to 
his words "less shock, more therapy" a meaning that they did not 
have. Russian citizens will merely suffer if the reforms are 
delayed. 
  Another reason why the "Partnership For Peace" program has 
undergone no changes since the 12 December elections is because 
the U.S. Administration interpreted Zhirinovskiy's success as a 
failure by the democratic government to explain its policy and 
as a reaction to specific mistakes in the implementation of 
democratic transformations -- but by no means as evidence that 
three-quarters of Russian citizens like Zhirinovskiy's views. 
  There has been increased criticism of "Partnership" in the 
United States itself and particularly in East Europe in the wake 
of 12 December. The fact that the program lays down no specific 
timetable or conditions for new states to join NATO is seen by 
critics as playing up to an ever-present Russian chauvinism. 
  Talbott considered it necessary to emphasize that the 
program 
"is an excellent prospect for Russia, which gains many 
advantages." 
  The program does not exclude any European country -- either 
neutral countries like Austria and Sweden, or former Warsaw Pact 
members, or those which have emerged from the ruins of the USSR. 
  "I met with President Clinton yesterday and we talked about 
the Russia trip," Talbott said in conclusion. "One of the 
points which struck him as very important on this long trip is 
to sit down in a small group with President Yeltsin and hear his 
view of the future."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Veksler] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- An official ceremony to 
greet U.S. President Bill Clinton is to be held in the Grand 
Kremlin Palace on January 13. Prior to 1917, the Kremlin served 
as the Moscow residence of Russian emperors. In the famous St. 
George Hall, the distinguished guest is to be greeted by 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The palace's largest hall, it is the place for state 
receptions and meetings dedicated to the Russian military order 
of St. George the Victorious. The snow-white walled hall is 
richly decorated with stucco moulding. The walls bear 
bas-reliefs showing St. George hitting a dragon. Above the 
cornice, under the ceiling, there are statues symbolising 
Russian army victories in the 15-19th centuries. The marble 
plaques on the walls and pylons bear gold-lettered designations 
of military units that distinguished themselves in battles and 
the names of the holders of St. George, among them prominent 
Russian military and naval leaders: Suvorov, Kutuzov, Ushakov 
and Nakhimov. 
  The greeting ceremony in the Kremlin will be immmediately 
followed by bilateral talks between the presidents of Russia and 
the U.S. In-between their talks, the two presidents are to take 
a stroll about the Kremlin grounds. It is not yet known what 
landmarks President Clinton will want to take in but he is sure 
to take interest in the cathedral square featuring Assumption, 
Annunciation and Archangel Cathedrals, the bell tower of Ivan 
the Great and other world-famed monuments of ancient Russian 
architecture. 
  The Hall of Facets adjacent to the Grand Kremlin Palace is 
rightfully reckoned a national architecture monument. The 
majestic and spacious hall, decorated with wall painting dealing 
with biblical subjects, is intended for state ceremonies. 
Territorial councils used to sit and Russian military victories 
were celebrated in it in olden times. 
  A state reception in honour of the U.S. President is to be 
given in the Hall of Facets.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Talalayev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- Press secretary of the 
Russian President Vyacheslav Kostikov has expressed the hope 
that the Russo-American summit meeting, which is to begin here 
today, would contribute to the strengthening of bilateral 
cooperation. 
  Replying to reporters within the building of the Council of 
the Federation, which held its first meeting here, Kostikov 
noted that the sides would "negotiate comprehensively and 
seriously" the relations between Russia and the United States. 
He believes that the U.S. President will explain in greater 
detail the American "partnership for peace" initiative. "Russia 
has no reasons to keep aloof of this initiative," the press 
secretary stressed. "It only remains to see to what extent its 
implementation meets the national interests of Russia. 
  Kostikov described as sharp and prompt the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's reaction to the unlawful actions of the Lithuanian 
authorities against two Russian generals. He said that "at 
present this reaction is adequate". "But the reaction of the 
president and of Russia might be even tougher if such incidents 
were to reoccur in the future, even very tough compared to world 
precedents," the press secretary stated.
