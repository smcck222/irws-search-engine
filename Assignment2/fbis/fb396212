  [Text] The main political topic of the upcoming talks in 
Moscow between the U.S. and Russian presidents will be the 
problem of nuclear weapons on the territory of the former Soviet 
Union, Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian Federation 
president's staff, told a RIA correspondent. In his view, the 
main problem is finding a way to ensure that there is only one 
nuclear state, Russia, on this territory.

  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- "One should have no 
illusions about trade and economic ties between Russia and the 
United States. If U.S. companies see no advantages, they will 
not go to Russia," said Anatoliy Porokhovskiy, deputy head of 
the Institute of the U.S. and Canada Studies of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, in an interview with ITAR-TASS timed to 
coincide with the issue of the "diplomatic courier" bulletin 
devoted to the forthcoming visit of the U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to Russia. 
  Porokhovskiy said that "cherishing hopes that the U.S. will 
spend money only because Russia needs help is pointless. One 
must take into account that whenever the U.S. allocates funds to 
support this or that country, primarily, it will give support to 
their own companies which will provide this aid, i.e. up to 80 
per cent of funds will be realised trough American private 
business and only 20 per cent of the allocated amount will 
directly reach facilities on the territory of our country." 
  "What we can hope for is the acceleration of processes which 
already began and the creation of a favourable atmosphere for 
the American business in Russia. As for the main task, we have 
to resolve it by ourselves. In this country, pinning hopes on 
the American capital to take us out of the situation in which we 
found ourselves will be another illusion, to put it mildly," 
Porokhovskiy said. 
  "It is necessary to precisely forecast what will be 
advantageous to our country and not to confine ourselves to only 
one variant in the search for the best option. Apart from 
America, there are Europe, Japan and other countries. We should 
take a flexible and active economic position which would clearly 
show that we come out for the development of relations with all 
countries, but on a mutually advantageous basis, which is 
accepted in business circles of any country," Porokhovskiy said.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences A.G. Kvasov, </F>
deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's North America 
Department: "Russian-American Economic Relations Geared toward 
Era of Open Markets"] 
  [Text] Russian-American relations occupy a special place 
in the multipolar geometry of the world that has taken shape 
since the end of the Cold War. Looming larger and embracing 
more and more new spheres, economic collaboration between Russia 
and the United States has become a direct or indirect subject of 
discussion in our country. Discarding all the accretions, the 
main question here is: Why do we need economic relations with 
the United States? What is their role in Russian foreign 
economic policy? 
  Objective analysis of the world economy and the trends in 
technical progress indicates that for the commercial development 
of the most advanced achievements -- "the technologies of 
tomorrow" -- which Russian science and in part the defense 
industry possess we cannot do without the American market. In 
the 20th Century no country, not even Japan, has been able to 
establish a major technical innovation of any description 
without passing the test of the American market. That market, 
by virtue of its readiness to accept any innovation and its 
unsurpassed size, can also serve as a springboard for Russian 
enterprises. Our economic collaboration will require more 
favorable conditions if this plan is to be realized. 
  Russian-U.S. trade and economic ties have for many decades 
been subordinated to a considerable extent to considerations of 
a political nature. From this standpoint the meeting between 
Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in Vancouver in April 1993, which 
initiated the development of partnership relations between our 
countries, was a landmark. Even outwardly it was unusual in 
that for the first time discussion of economic problems took up 
a large part of the presidents' time. It was there that mutual 
understanding was achieved for the first time that the most 
effective way to help the Russian reforms is to give us the 
chance to earn the requisite foreign currency ourselves. 
  The creation of an intergovernmental commission under the 
leadership of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
U.S. Vice President Al Gore was an important decision made at 
the Vancouver summit. The commission was essentially charged 
with the task of "depoliticizing" trade and economic relations 
between our countries and rendering them such that they promote 
the development of Russian-American partnership. The 
commission's mandate is to remove all possible obstacles as 
quickly as possible and to launch specific bilateral cooperation 
projects, first and foremost in promising areas like power 
generation, including nuclear power generation, outer space, and 
other hi-tech sectors of the economy. 
  The first session of the Russian-American Commission for 
Economic and Technical Cooperation was held in Washington at the 
start of September 1993. During the meeting a broader remit for 
the commission was agreed and an appropriate structure of 
working bodies, including committees for the development of 
business cooperation, energy policy, the conversion of the 
defense industry, outer space, the environment, and science and 
technology, was set up. The opening up of the American and 
world markets to Russian space equipment, technology, and 
services was the chief result of the committee's first session. 
Thus, under an agreement on commercial launches, Russia was 
granted a quota of 12 launches of spacecraft into orbit in the 
period 1996-2000, which could provide our aerospace enterprises 
with contracts worth up to $700 million. 
  There was no issue, no problem, which Bill did not rush to 
tackle. Against the backdrop of his obsession with detail -- 
which prompted many political pundits to compare the President 
to a "head clerk" but not a leader -- Hillary, embarking on 
working out a strategy to reform medical insurance and the 
health care system in general, looked like someone who was 
really busy. 
  An abrupt change came almost immediately after he went on 
vacation in August and spent an uninterrupted three weeks not 
only relaxing and taking it easy, but thinking about whether he 
was organizing his presidential life properly. As the 
well-informed UPI noted at the time, "the President has clearly 
taken a big step forward in ditching his devotion to detail and 
getting a clearer idea of where he wants to take the country." 
  The switch to strategic goals does not mean, however, that 
smaller-scale problems have been totally removed from the 
President's attention, or that even when decrees and 
proclamations carry a computer-printed signature rather than 
that of Clinton himself, these decrees and proclamations are 
almost automatic candidates for revision, review, and repeal. I 
do not recall a single instance either in the Clinton presidency 
or during the Bush and Reagan era when a document in the name of 
the White House incumbent was repealed, altered, or simply 
ignored the next day. Indisputably, the President's staff 
deserves a great deal of credit in organizing this stability. 
And the fact that Clinton's guys -- whose average age is nearly 
30, who are mostly provincial products of Arkansas, and whose 
experience in government is virtually zero -- have managed to 
avoid situations that are ever-present here in Russia is, of 
course, the result of the Americans' different political and 
administrative traditions. 
  Starting with the Gorbachev era, high-ranking Kremlin groups 
-- led as a rule by the heads of presidential administrations or 
secretariats -- have been regularly sent to Washington for 
"proficiency enhancement" courses. Sergey Filatov recently 
visited their White House. The results of these trips are 
almost invisible. If the American experience had indeed been 
productive, the Kremlin would not have made frankly 
controversial and politically explosive decisions such as the 
decision not to allow the new Russian parliament into Moscow's 
White House. Even a 30-year-old rookie staffer from Arkansas 
would realize on joining the presidential staff that this kind 
of decision had to be avoided at all costs. It is an axiom of 
American political life and the basis of political stability 
that Congress must not be offended or humiliated. You can 
argue, shout till you're blue in the face, bang your fist, or 
even -- like Khrushchev -- your shoe, but in no circumstances 
must you wound, even by allusion, its comfortable sense of its 
own dignity and prestige. 
  Alongside the meetings which Clinton will hold in Moscow 
with 
Boris Yeltsin and which will be interspersed only infrequently 
with relaxation (such as a nice tour of a chocolate factory or a 
kind of TV discussion between the U.S. President and Russian 
citizens invited to "Ostankino") I would include on the Moscow 
visit agenda -- apart from the mandatory and longstanding 
disarmament, economic, and trade issues -- the question of what 
should be done and in what way to parliament when it becomes 
recalcitrant or simply unattractive because of its actions. I 
think that Clinton could tell us a lot, both from his 
gubernatorial practice in Arkansas and from his presidential 
experience. By hook or by crook he has achieved and is 
achieving ratification of bills in which his administration has 
an interest and which Congress initially met without raucous 
acclaim or even mere condescending approbation. 
  But, in general, if I were drawing up the program for 
Clinton's Moscow visit, I would expand the informal side of it 
as much as possible -- the U.S. President is a passed master at 
glad-handing, and has appeared far more often on the streets of 
Washington and other American towns and cities than many of his 
predecessors (or, to be blunt, more often than the Russian 
president has appeared on Russian streets of late). 
  Bill Clinton first visited this country almost 25 years ago. 
He came to Moscow as a tourist from Oxford, where he was then 
studying. That trip played a lot on his nerves during the 
election campaign -- Republican opponents charged that in that 
far-off era it was impossible for ordinary people to visit 
Moscow, and that if they did, it was only with the knowledge, 
approval, and, consequently, complete control of the secret 
police. 
  Now that Bill Clinton is coming again, the secret police as 
such no longer officially exists -- it is in the process of a 
prolonged reorganization. Have no worries about coming, Mr. 
President.

  [Text] St. Petersburg January 10 ITAR-TASS -- Specialists 
from Russia and the United States have pooled their efforts in 
coordinating international global research of the northern 
hemisphere. The first stage of the project provides for an 
exchange in geophysical technologies already tested by either 
side. 
  According to Yevgeniy Guryanov, vice president of the 
Leninets holding company based in St. Petersburg, leading 
research and producing firms of the two countries and aviation 
support groups will participate in fulfilment of the project. 
  Some contracts have already been completed, including the 
transfer of Russian magnetometers to an American company. Some 
earth surface research devices will soon be sold to the 
Americans. 
  The bulk of observations will be conducted from the air, 
using aircraft of the Canadian Air Force and coast guards. The 
parties involved have already identified the airfields and 
traffic control centres located in various Arctic regions in 
Russia, Canada and the United States.

  [Text] A two-day summit of NATO member-countries opened in 
Brussels today. It discussed as its central issue the 
Partnership for Peace plan proposed by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. This envisages the establishment of military links 
between the North Atlantic Alliance and the countries of East 
Europe and the former Soviet republics, including the Russian 
Federation. 
  As is known, Russia does not object to these links, but is 
opposed to NATO's expansion into countries in close proximity to 
the Russian borders. Incidentally, experts of the Russian 
Defense Ministry note that NATO itself lacks unity of views 
regarding the next steps after the possible adoption of the U.S. 
Partnership for Peace plan. Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian 
defense minister, speaks about the stand of the Russian military 
in greater detail: 
  [begin Grachev recording] We are advocates of a path that 
leads to a truly pan-European system of security. This means 
collective actions -- but not in accordance with the criteria of 
membership in the bloc -- aimed at preventing and settling the 
crises and conflicts now shaking Europe. I believe that 
security and international stability should be indivisible and 
should be based on common European structures. Russia is 
proceeding from the fact that our relations with NATO should be 
richer and should develop in broad-ranging cooperation. We 
believe that rapprochement between Russia and NATO should be 
going at an accelerated pace. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Manki Ponomarev article: "Meeting in Brussels Begins"] </F>
  [Text] The work of the extraordinary NATO Council session 
at the level of heads of state and government of the 
military-political alliance's member-countries began yesterday 
in Brussels. Judging from initial reports received from the 
Belgian capital three main questions will take a central place 
on the session agenda. First, can the transatlantic alliance be 
maintained now that the Cold War has ended and the United States 
is terminating its military presence in Europe, and if so, how 
can this be done? Second is the relationship between NATO and 
its former adversaries -- the states making up the Warsaw Pact, 
many of which, as well as Lithuania, Macedonia, and a number of 
others, are persistently knocking on the bloc's door. Third, 
what kind of future does the alliance have in general, and what 
tasks is it designed to fulfill now? In addition, at the 
insistence of France and the Netherlands, there will be a debate 
about whether bombing strikes should be made on Serb positions 
in connection with the latest exacerbation of the situation in 
the area of Sarajevo. 
  We will have to wait a day or two for the results of the 
discussion of all these questions. But even now it is clear 
that no NATO Council session has ever attracted such attention 
as the one now taking place in Brussels. An avalanche of 
speeches, statements, publications, and comments has swamped the 
public. The most diverse opinions are being expressed. The 
British SUNDAY TIMES, for example, claims that the North 
Atlantic alliance is on the brink of a slow death because the 
reason for its existence has disappeared. While THE NEW YORK 
TIMES observer W. Safire calls on NATO leaders to take advantage 
of the "temporary weakening of Russia" to expand the bloc and 
include East European countries in it. 
  U.S President Bill Clinton also agrees with the need to 
review the alliance's role. But he believes that efforts must 
be channeled into developing partnership with East European 
countries, including those which previously comprised the USSR. 
And, THE WASHINGTON POST observed, he has taken on a solemn 
duty: America will play a leading role, "linking" the stable, 
democratic states of the West with the emerging democracies of 
the East in the military and economic spheres and in the sphere 
of creating democratic institutions. 
  This purpose should be served by the "Partnership for Peace" 
program, which will essentially be an intensification of the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council's activity. The question of 
expanding NATO is not being put on the agenda now because it 
carries the risk of dividing Europe into blocs and drawing new 
demarcation lines on its map.

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report under the "Yesterday" rubric: </F>
"Russia and NATO"] 
  [Text] A NATO session at the level of heads of state and 
government opened in Brussels yesterday. It is assumed that two 
key decisions will be adopted: Readiness to accept new members 
into the bloc has been expressed, and the start of the 
implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" program, aimed at 
closer military-political cooperation between NATO and the 
countries of the former socialist community, has been announced. 
  The insistent knocking on NATO's door by a number of former 
Warsaw Pact countries -- first and foremost Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, and Slovakia, joined by Lithuania in the past 
few days -- has provoked a negative response from Moscow, which 
with every justification assesses the possible eastward 
expansion of the North Atlantic alliance as a manifestation of 
bloc ideology and an attempt to isolate Russia from Europe-wide 
processes. This assessment was voiced in a statement made by 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian Federation president's press 
secretary, and a number of speeches made by Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev. "The over-hasty eastward expansion of NATO has 
the potential to provoke the development of a most terrible 
scenario," the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry stressed 
notably during an interview with the German FRANKURTER 
RUNDSCHAU. "It will deliver into the hands of extremists in 
Russia a strong argument in favor of the need to revive the 
Russian empire in order to resist the 'offensive from the West.'" 
  According to Andrey Kozyrev, the fears about a renewed 
"threat from the east" about which our neighbors have been 
talking recently can be dispelled first and foremost through the 
strategy of partnership with democratic Russia, which is moving 
toward a rule of law state and a market economy. Those who talk 
about some kind of "aggressive" policy in Europe on Moscow's 
part are in no position to cite any specific evidence. 
  Nevertheless, East Europeans have the right to obtain 
greater 
guarantees for their security. No one is disputing this. But 
they can be secured in practice without becoming a permanent 
member of any military-political alliance. In particular, this 
aim can be achieved by carrying out the strategy of partnership 
in political questions, as well as in the sphere of security, 
put forward by Russia. As we know, Washington has agreed to 
this idea, formulating it in the "Partnership for Peace" 
program, as have the capitals of other European states. Right 
away, on his first day in Brussels, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
noted: "The changes which have occurred in recent years in the 
international arena require the NATO allies to review the 
organization's role and channel efforts into developing 
partnership with the East European countries which have embarked 
on the path of democracy." 
  Other Western leaders agree with this stance. "I am in favor 
of NATO's expanding its relations with Russia in the security 
sphere," FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated on the eve of the 
Brussels summit. At the same time, he especially stressed the 
need to dispel concerns that the West is pursing a line aimed at 
isolating Russia. Speaking in turn about the North Atlantic 
alliance's East Europe strategy, NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner stressed that the alliance's leadership has not yet 
determined specific dates for new members to join the bloc. 
  Today we will find out how close these statements are to 
specific actions. But one thing is clear: Without Russia's 
participation, security in Europe is impossible.

  [Text] In view of the agreement reached in principle on 
some important bilateral issues, including those connected with 
nuclear arms, President Boris Yeltsin invited his Ukrainian 
counterpart, Leonid Kravchuk, to come to Moscow, the Russian 
president's press service said on Monday. 
  The communique says that a working 
Russian-American-Ukrainian 
top-level meeting will take place in the Kremlin on January 14. 
According to an understanding reached between Boris Yeltsin and 
Bill Clinton, the American president may make a brief stop in 
Kiev's airport, Borispol, on January 12 on his way to Moscow. 
  At 16:00 on January 10 U.S. diplomats in Moscow announced 
they knew nothing about any stopover at Kiev's Borispol Airport 
on his way to Moscow. Their message was received by Interfax.

  [Text] Informed sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry 
told Interfax that Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk would 
arrive in Moscow to meet with Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill 
Clinton. The three presidents are expected to meet on January 
14. 
  The sources also said that the reports on Clinton's visit to 
Ukraine were "groundless." 
  Meanwhile, informed sources in Kiev told Interfax that the 
authorities there do not rule out the possibility of President 
Clinton's stopover in the Ukrainian capital. They say that a 
meeting of Kravchuk and Clinton could resolve all issues in the 
stationing of nuclear weapons in Ukraine that cause American 
concern. The same sources note that in this case Leonid 
Kravchuk's trip to Moscow would be "problematic" unless 
trilateral documents could be signed there.

Zhirinovskiy has called on the Crimean residents to cast their 
ballots at the coming presidential elections on January 16 in 
favor of the leader of the Russian Party of the Crimea, Sergey

  [Text] Riga January 10 TASS -- The Russian Embassy in 
Latvia sent a note to Latvian authorities on Monday protesting 
against the blockade of Russian military facilities by Latvian 
paramilitary units. 
  Vladimir Ionkin, the press secretary of the Russian Embassy 
in Latvia, told ITAR-TASS that the militants detained two 
generals -- Nikolay Tailakov and Anatoliy Vodopyanov -- who were 
sent to the facilities by the commander of the Northwestern 
Group of Russian Troops. They handcuffed them and drove in an 
unknown direction. The generals were freed only after the 
intervention of the Russian Embassy. The Latvian authorities 
sent their apologies for the incident and assured the Russian 
Embassy that the facilities were being unlocked. 
  Early on Monday a group of Latvian militants stopped a car 
of 
the Russian ambassador and refused to let it pass despite the 
ambassador's protests. After long deliberations they allowed 
the car to pass but waved their guns at it. 
  The Russian Embassy issued a protest to the Latvian Foreign 
Ministry, describing the incident as a potentially dangerous 
provocation. The embassy expressed the hope that the Latvian 
authorities will take the necessary measures to prevent such 
incidents in the future. The note considered the incident as an 
attempt to thwart the talks on the troop withdrawal.

  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- The Russian Defence 
Ministry issued the following statement on Monday, following the 
blockade of Russian military facilities by Latvian paramilitary 
units and detention of two Russian generals and the Russian 
ambassador's car. 
  "On the morning of January 10, 1994 armed groups of 
Zemessargs (Latvian paramilitary units) seized several 
facilities on the outskirts of Riga. Major-General Nikolay 
Taylakov, deputy commander of the Northwestern Group of Troops, 
and Major-General Anatoliy Vodopyanov, assistant to the 
commander of the Northwestern Group of Troops for work with 
personnel, arrived at the scene of the incident. In return to 
their demand to leave the seized facilities, the chairman of the 
Vidzeme district gave on order to arrest the generals. The 
Russian generals were handcuffed and put into a car which drove 
towards the Russian border. Commander of the Northwestern Group 
of Troops Colonel-General Leonid Mayorov informed the Russian 
defence minister about the incident. Defence Minister Army 
General Pavel Grachev issued an order to put Russian troops 
stationed in Latvia on alert and tighten security at the 
facilities and premises belonging to the Northwestern Group of 
Troops. On alert were also placed air-borne troops and military 
cargo aviation. The commander of the Northwestern Group of 
Troops informed Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis about the 
incident. The president expressed bewilderment over the 
incident, gave orders to free the detained generals and offered 
his apologies. By 17:00 the Russian generals and all seized 
facilities were freed. 
  The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation demands an 
immediate investigation and punishment of those guilty. Any 
violent or unlawful acts against the Russian servicemen, 
military units and facilities of the Russian Army will be 
checked in the most decisive manner. Responsibility for all 
possible consequences in this case will rest with the local 
authorities who must ensure a normal situation around the 
Russian military units," the statement said. 
  The generals were freed only after the intervention of the 
Russian Embassy. The Latvian authorities sent their apologies 
for the incident and assured the Russian Embassy that the 
facilities were being unlocked. 
  Early on Monday a group of Latvian militants stopped a car 
of 
the Russian ambassador and refused to let it pass despite the 
ambassador's protests. After long deliberations they allowed 
the car to pass but waived their guns at it. 
  The Russian Embassy issued a protest to the Latvian Foreign 
Ministry, describing the incident as a potentially dangerous 
provocation. The embassy expressed the hope that the Latvian 
authorities will take the necessary measures to prevent such 
incidents in the future. The note considered the incident as an 
attempt to thwart the talks on the troop withdrawal.

  [Text] Riga January 10 TASS -- A Russian airborne division 
deployed in the city of Pskov near the Latvian border went on 
high alert on Monday after an incident in Riga involving Russian 
military units, which Russian Ambassador-at-large Sergey Zotov 
qualified as a "provocation." 
  "Necessary measures have been taken to put the Pskov 
airborne 
division on alert," Zotov said in a statement on Monday, adding 
that units of the Northwestern Group of Russian Troops are also 
on high alert. 
  "As is known, on January 10 the talks were due to take place 
between the heads of the state delegations of Latvia and Russia 
on the set of problems connected with the troop withdrawal. 
Today, on the day of the delegation's arrival in Riga, 
outspoken provocative actions were taken against the 
Northeastern Group of Troops [as received] by the administration 
of the Vidzeme district of Riga," the statement said. 
  "Acting on the direct order from the district leadership, 
paramilitary units seized four facilities of the Russian Armed 
Forces and arrested Major-General Nikolay Taylakov, deputy 
commander of the Northwestern Group of Troops, and Major-General 
Anatoliy Vodopyanov, assistant to the commander of the 
Northwestern Group of Troops for work with personnel, who 
arrived at the scene of the incident. Violence was committed 
against the representatives of the troop command: The Russian 
generals were handcuffed and driven towards the Latvian-Russian 
border under guard," said Zotov, who is also head of the Russian 
delegation to the talks with Latvia on troop withdrawal. 
  "At the airport Commander of the Northwestern Group of 
Troops 
Colonel-General Leonid Mayorov informed the Russian state 
delegation about this flagrant provocative act by Latvian 
authorities. In this connection I voiced strong protest to the 
head of the Latvian delegation, Martyns Virsus, and demanded an 
immediate release of the arrested Russian generals and 
unblocking of the seized military facilities. The delegation 
announced its decision not to begin talks until all 
circumstances of this extraordinary incident have been found out. 
  "I informed the Russian Foreign Ministry, Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev and the top Russian officials about the outright 
arbitrariness of Latvian extremist forces. It has come to the 
delegation's knowledge that respective military units of the 
Northwestern Group of Troops have been placed on high alert. 
Necessary measures have been taken to put the Pskov airborne 
division on alert. The Russian delegation considers the 
provocative actions by the Zemessargs (Latvian paramilitary 
units) as nothing else but an attempt to torpedo the 
Russian-Latvian talks and complicate relations between Russia 
and Latvia. 
  "In connection with the coming reports about the release of 
the Russian generals and the beginning of the unblocking of the 
seized facilities, and taking into account the apologies made by 
the Latvian leadership for the Zemessargs's actions, the Russian 
delegation has agreed to begin the talks on January 11," the 
statement said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Kozyrev by Ivan Pankov on </F>
10 January; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Pankov] What happened in Latvia? 
  [Kozyrev] In Latvia, judging by everything, there has 
occurred a most flagrant provocation, perpetrated by armed 
representatives of the land guard [okhrana kraya], that is, the 
government forces. But today towards the end of the day we 
received an official apology via the Embassy of Russia which 
intervened in this situation and it is possible that it is a 
question of a provocation also against the line of the Latvian 
authorities themselves, the President. 
  And the factual aspect is very simple and crude. These armed 
gangs surrounded and blockaded military facilities which they 
claim constitute a threat to Latvia, but which in actual fact 
involve a stadium, a swimming pool, and the residence of the 
Russian ambassador in Riga, which of course cannot in any way 
constitute a danger to anyone. 
  The two generals which were sent by the Russian command in 
order to assess the situation on the scene were subjected to 
insulting behavior, virtually arrested, taken somewhere into the 
forest, subjected to threats, they were even handcuffed. 
  This is absolutely impermissible, intolerable behavior 
towards representatives of the Russian Armed Forces which have 
been placed on heightened combat alert. The embassy immediately 
undertook measures to clear up the situation. And we must with 
all resoluteness warn that Russia will take all necessary 
measures to protect her citizens especially those in military or 
diplomatic uniform, indeed simply any of her citizens, from such 
attacks and once again I repeat, we expect, at a higher level, a 
more extensive explanation, apology, and punishment of those 
guilty for this incident.

<F P=106> [From the "M-Trust" program; video report by unnamed </F>
correspondent] 
  [Excerpts] [correspondent over aerial shot of region] In 
December, on the eve of the New Year, the Governments of Russia 
and Kazakhstan finally decided on a way of preserving the vital 
operational capacity of the unique Baykonur Space Center 
complex. A recent press conference held at the Russian Space 
Agency was devoted to explaining the problems which have beset 
the multibillion industrial and scientific giant's 40-year 
history, and which are set to dog its present and its future. 
Baykonur started out as an isolated entity deep in the steppe 
heartland. Today, however, it is a whole state comprising 
impressive constructions, power-consuming plants, assembly 
buildings, and the city of Leninsk. Alongside the complex's 
famous No. 2 launchpad, the starting point for satellite 
launches, Gagarin's spaceflight, and indeed that of the 
cosmonauts currently in orbit -- that is, alongside this living 
legend other launchpads have been constructed, including sites 
for the Proton and Energiya rockets. Many kilometers of cable 
worth billions of rubles have been invested in this site. And 
state-of-the-art technology is used in the rockets, the 
payloads, in work carried out in orbit, and in the help 
proffered from Earth. So Baykonur's separation from Russia's 
multifaceted space sector would result in a loss of resources 
and a dissipation of personnel and profitable contracts. The 
point being that the new super-complex being developed on the 
basis of Plesetsk is going to take between eight and 10 years to 
build. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent resumes over video of servicemen sitting on a 
bench] At the moment, Baykonur keeps going basically by dint of 
the fact that 28,000 Russian servicemen are there to operate it. 
For this reason it is hard to imagine any kind of commercial 
mechanism succeeding, be it a firm or a corporation. Frankly, to 
totally demilitarize Baykonur and replace military with civilian 
experts overnight would spell disaster. And talk of generating 
sufficient revenue on site for the giant Baykonur-Leninsk 
complex to pay its own way is little short of ridiculous. 
Russia is going to rent the entire complex from Kazakhstan, 
financially compensate for the ecological damage, and clear the 
400,000 hectares of proving ground of scrap metal. However, this 
will not entail the billions of dollars which are being alluded 
to but will be done with due consideration for the overall state 
of accounts between Russia and Kazakhstan. Finally, at a time 
when 37 percent of Russia's space budget goes on maintaining the 
Mir space station, our participation in the new international 
space project -- the "Alpha" Station -- will create new jobs for 
tens of thousands of people and a billion dollars in profits in 
the next four years alone. Not to mention the production of new 
spacesuits in conjunction with the Germans, and of collapsible 
modules for India -- in fact, contracts have been concluded with 
20 states in all. And all this represents technology, profit, 
and prosperity. [video shows shots of Baykonur, government

<F P=106> [Svetlana Lyuboshits report: "`Hares' Were Mowed Down at </F>
Midnight. Belarus Has the Ruble Once Again"] 
  [Text] The lengthy hesitation about whether there should 
be a ruble zone were crowned on Christmas eve by the signing of 
a treaty merging the monetary systems of Russia and the Belarus 
Republic. 
  Andrey Illarionov, deputy chief of the Economic Reforms 
Working Center, thinks that in its content, the agreement brings 
us back to a situation where the noncash monetary systems of the 
former Soviet republics were still undivided. 
  But the situation is essentially fundamentally new. Russia 
has presented Belarus with a really royal Christmas gift. The 
thing is that the National Bank of Belarus keeps its 
independence, and two emission centers are being created -- that 
of the Russian Federation Central Bank and that of the Republic 
of Belarus National Bank. Curiously, the agreement envisions no 
effective mechanism to keep tabs on emissions, primarily noncash 
emissions. 
  One is also amazed, to put it mildly, at Article 6 of the 
agreement. Under it, the National Bank of Belarus and our 
Central Bank undertake to create a joint fund of gold [hard] 
currency, and other highly liquid assets in an agreed amount. 
Remarkably, the fund is to be formed in proportion to the share 
of the sides in the aggregate credit emission. Belarus has 
practically no such assets, with the result that the fund will 
be set up by Russia, with Russia having to transfer to Belarus 
part of its gold and hard currency reserves. 
  Being too big does not end there. It is proposed to merge 
the republics' [as published] on the basis of one "hare" 
[Belarus ruble has a hare depicted on it] per one ruble. Given 
the real market rate of 4.5 or 5 "hares" per one Russian ruble, 
this means that Russia would give Belarus virtually an 
interest-free loan of approximately 1.6 trillion rubles. 
  According to the most conservative estimate, Russia will 
simultaneously pay for it with a 10-percent rise in inflation in 
one fell swoop.

  [Text] While talking to journaliists, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russian nationalists, has confirmed his 
readiness to come to Poland. 
  [Correspondent Andrzej Siezieniewski] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
was in a hurry to attend the first meeting of the parliamentary 
floor group of his party, but when he learned that we were from 
Poland, he stopped and spared a moment for us. 
  [Zhirinovskiy, in Russian with superimposed Polish 
translation] "We have the highest brotherly feelings toward you. 
We are Slavs. The hostility of the period of the Czarist 
empire and the period of communism, humiliations, suffering, big 
brother, little brother -- this is all a thing of the past. We 
live side by side. We are neighbors and Slavs, and we would like 
Poland to be always a flourishing and democratic state." 
  [Siezieniewski] Asked whom he would like to talk to in 
Warsaw, he replied: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] "To everybody, the president, the head of 
government, Sejm deputies and leaders of every party and public 
organization. With journalists as well. I would like to talk 
with them about us ceasing to look at each other with hostility. 
How long could it last. You are Catholics, we are Orthodox. 
Is this sufficient reason to divide people? Let us take 
Yugoslavia as an example. The Orthodox Serbs and Catholic 
Croats are shooting at each other. This is a manifestation of 
savagery." 
  [Siezieniewski] We took the opportunity to ask him about his 
position toward Poland's plans to join NATO. 
  [Zhirinowskiy] "Negative. Let us all be neutral and neither 
we nor you join. Do not think that they are waiting for you 
there. Even if that is so, it is waiting for servants who would 
polish the boots of German or British generals. They would 
force you to feed foreign divisions, they would behave like 
peasants." 
  [Siezieniewski] This is what the leader of Russian Liberal 
Democrats maintains, and he adds: 
  [Zhirinowskiy] "Blacks from America will come over and kick 
you in the face. You are going to be a testing ground and a 
dump. You must understand that a neutral Poland and security 
guarantees for the whole of East Europe are what we need. 
  "We Russians have never had an urge to push west. We have 
problems in the south. So, if you want, we will give you Lvov 
back. Do not join NATO in any case." 
  [Siezieniewski] Finally, returning once again to his Polish 
sentiments, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] "I like Poles. My two deputies Zhebrovskiy 
and Vengerovskiy are of Polish origin. I want you to know that 
we are a normal democratic party. There is neither fascism nor 
communism nor any other extremism in us. We are for the best 
possible relations with Poland." 
  [Siezieniewski] During the first meeting of the Liberal 
Democrats parliamentary floor group, to which he was going, he 
pronounced himself for maintaining the strong presidential power 
and equally strong parliament. He accepts the new constitution 
90 percent. He believes that the time will come when Russia 
will be able to become a real parliamentary republic without any 
dictatorship.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS -- Estonian Foreign Minister 
Trivimi Velliste, to be replaced by Juri Luik under the current 
changes in the Cabinet, is to take over as the country's 
ambassador to the United Nations. 
  Estonia's current ambassador to the United Nations, the 
country's oldest diplomat Ernst Jaakson has announced plans to 
resign this year, Prime Minister Mart Laar said. It was decided 
earlier that Velliste would take over the office in New York. 
"It is in every way logical that the change takes place now," 
Laar said. 
  "The man to take over the foreign minister's office is the 
so 
far Defense Minister Juri Luik, of whom I believe that he will 
be more useful in that position," Laar added. "I believe that 
Indrek Kannik is able to successfully take over as the defense 
minister," he said. 
  Finance Minister Madis Uurike, who is also to be replaced in 
the same series of changes, will take up an adviser's position 
with the government. Uurike is to focus on issues connected with 
foreign loans, their usage and repayment, the prime minister 
added. 
  But he also said the necessity of changes in the Finance 
Ministry had been "long talked about." 
  "A certain working against the reforms or delaying them has 
been felt in the Finance Ministry every now and then," Laar 
said, pointing out the tax reform as one example. He said Heiki 
Kranich, who is appointed to take over as the finance minister, 
had been one of the parliament's main "driving forces" behind 
the tax reform. 
  Laar said that Toomas Sildmae, who is to quit as the 
economics minister, was to resume his office as the head of 
Finest Hotel Group Ltd., one of the country's three largest 
hotel companies. 
  The prime minister expressed the hope that Sildmae would 
keep 
up his ties with the government, but added that Sildmae as 
minister was at variance with the majority of the ruling 
coalition MPs. 
  "There is no reason to search where these variances had 
their 
beginning. But it is clear that in a parliamentarian system no 
minister lacking the trust of and cooperation in the parliament 
is able to work effectively," he added. 
  Toivo Jurgenson, to take over as economics minister, is to 
continue Sildmae's policy, at the same time increasing the pace 
of working out legislation in the sphere of the economy, Laar 
assured.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar at 1 p.m. local time [1100 GMT] today presented to the 
country's president the formal proposals concerning the 
replacement of Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste, Finance 
Minister Madis Uurike, Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae and 
Defense Minister Juri Luik. 
  The new appointments are Juri Luik as the foreign minister, 
Heiki Kranich as the finance minister, Toivo Jurgenson as the 
economics minister and Indrek Kannik as the defense minister. 
  Laar after the meeting at the presidential office at 
Kadriorg 
characterized the president's reaction to the planned changes in 
the Cabinet as "understanding." 
  "The president asked a few questions," Laar said. "He will 
surely consider the aptitude or inaptitude of each candidate for 
the office at least for himself." 
  Laar said no hindrances were to be expected from President 
Meri for the Cabinet changes. "I felt no such tone during the 
conversation with the president. This (changes in the Cabinet) 
is an issue to be decided upon by the coalition and the prime 
minister," he said. 
  The prime minister said that in his point of view the 
constitution didn't allow the president to refuse from approving 
a minister candidate. "But there also are gaps in the 
constitution," Laar added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar at 1 p.m. local time [1100 GMT] today formally 
presented to the country's president the proposals concerning 
the replacement of Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste, Finance 
Minister Madis Uurike, Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae and 
Defense Minister Juri Luik, officials at the presidential 
chancellery and the government press office said. 
  The new appointments are Juri Luik as the foreign minister, 
Heiki Kranich as the finance minister, Toivo Jurgenson as the 
economics minister and Indrek Kannik as the defense minister. 
  The changes are aimed at "bringing new blood into the 
government and improving cooperation between the parliament 
factions and the government," government spokesman Ain Saarna 
said. 
  Today's formal presentation of the appointments was preceded 
by the president's and the prime minister's consultations with 
the heads of the ruling coalition factions in the parliament. 
The minister nominees have also presented their plans of action 
before the council of the ruling coalition and the Cabinet. 
  All of the minister candidates received the support of the 
ruling coalition parties. 
  The changes in the government must be approved by President 
Lennart Meri, who under the government law has got three days to 
make his decision.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS - The policy of the Estonian 
Government won't change after the replacement of some of the 
ministers, Prime Minister Mart Laar said in an interview with 
BNS today. 
  Instead, it will provide the opportunity to more 
consistently 
carry out the current policy and change just a few points of 
emphasis, he said. 
  Laar said the government planned to pay special attention to 
the tax reform and to putting the Tax Department to work. Laar 
criticized the Finance Ministry, which in his words had delayed 
reforms and in some cases ever "worked against them." 
  He said the Economics Ministry under the new minister was 
expected to pay more attention to working out legislations. 
  Laar said he was sure that the ministerial changes were not 
going to bring down the professionalism of the Cabinet. "The new 
ministers have gained experience in politics, which will enable 
them to come to better terms with the parliament," he said. 
  The prime minister declined to comment on whether or not the 
other coalition partners -- the Moderates and the Estonian 
National Independence Party -- had plans to replace any of their 
ministers.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS -- The head of the Estonian 
delegation for talks with Russia may be replaced after the most 
important issues in the relations between the two countries have 
been settled, said the chancellor of the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry, Alar Olljum. 
  The Estonian delegation at present is headed by Defense 
Minister Juri Luik. Some sources say Luik is likely to be 
appointed the foreign minister in a series of changes in the 
government due before the Jan. 10 meeting of the parliament. 
  The official status of the Estonian delegation rose first 
with Luik's appointment as defense minister. The Russian 
delegation is headed by Special Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin. 
  "If we reach a breakthrough and an agreement on the main 
issues, including that of the troop withdrawal, and when only 
more prosaic and technical issues of detail remain on the 
agenda, we can easily replace the head of the delegation," 
Olljum said. 
  He also said the Foreign Ministry already had a candidate 
for 
the new leader of the delegation, but added that he considered 
it premature to reveal the candidate's name.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS -- Representatives from the 
foreign ministries of Estonia and Russia should meet still 
before the beginning of the next round of bilateral talks, says 
the chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Alar Olljum. 
  The next scheduled round of talks between the two countries 
is to begin on Jan. 18 in Moscow. 
  Olljum in an interview with BNS said several important 
events, including a U.S.-Russian summit and the first meeting of 
the new Russian parliament, are to take place before Jan. 18. 
The chancellor said these events caused the need for some kind 
of preliminary talks before the scheduled meeting of delegations. 
  Speaking about his planned meeting with Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, Olljum said "the invitation 
from the Estonian side remains in force." 
  The foreign ministers of the two countries at a meeting in 
Brussels early last month agreed in principle on a meeting 
between Olljum and Churkin. Olljum said Churkin had been ready 
to come to Estonia in the last week of December, when Olljum was 
having his vacation. 
  Estonia has received no proposal so far about a new possible 
date for Churkin's visit.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 05, BNS -- Estonian leaders' 
statements that the country wishes to join NATO haven't had much 
influence on the course of negotiations between the two 
countries, Vasiliy Svirin, the head of the Russian delegation 
for talks with Estonia, told BNS. 
  Svirin maintained that his country's position and the 
directions of its foreign policy are determined by the Russian 
president, who "has unequivocally stated his views on this 
issue." 
  The diplomat hinted that Russia is much more concerned about 
Estonia's cold attitude toward proposals for solving the 
problems of Russian-speakers' citizenship and social protection. 
  He claimed Russia presented the principles of troop 
withdrawal from Estonia already at the Dec. 1-2 meeting in 
Tallinn. 
  "Unfortunately, the Estonian delegation insisted even then 
that the pullout of Russian troops be completed by Jan. 1," 
Svirin claimed. He said he has no information about Estonia's 
proposals for the next round of talks scheduled to take place 
Jan. 18-19 in Moscow. 
  Svirin said the Russian delegation expressed during the 
latest round of negotiations its displeasure at the Estonian 
government's Dec. 1 decree on granting residence permits to 
retired military and their family members. 
  In his opinion, the requirement that military pensioners 
sign a promise to honor Estonia's constitutional order, not to 
endanger the country's security with their activity and not to 
participate in the activity of armed groups, is humiliating. 
  Svirin also said that, in the field of economy, Russia is 
preparing for "constructive work" this year to study closely a 
draft agreement on economic and commercial cooperation, as well 
as contracts on the use of ports, on transportation and on 
questions related to the Soviet Union's foreign debt. He said 
the drafts for about a dozen economic agreements will come under 
negotiation. 
  Svirin stated that Russia intends to tie the conclusion of 
economic agreements favorable for Estonia to the signing of 
humanitarian accords.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS -- Estonian political circles 
seem to have reached the conclusion that a border between 
Estonia and Latvia is not needed, Udo Helme, the head of the 
Estonian delegation to the joint border commission, charged in 
an interview to BNS today. 
  "Since Estonia and Latvia have established a visa-free 
regime 
between the two countries, erroneous references to several 
western countries that also don't require entrance visas are 
made," Helme said. "People who do so confuse the different 
functions of a border -- the political, the juridical, and the 
security ones. 
  "This is detrimental to the de facto restoration of the 
Republic of Estonia as an independent state," Helme claimed. 
  A Foreign Ministry official told BNS that Vello Saatpalu, 
the 
chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Commission, made a 
proposal to the government to stop designating the boundary 
between Estonia and Latvia, since it is "a waste of the 
taxpayers' money." 
  Under the Estonian-Latvian agreement on restoring the 
boundary concluded in March 1992, Estonia is to mark off the 
border from the Pededze River in the east to the town of Valga, 
and Latvia, from Valga to Ikla in the west. 
  Estonia has until now marked off an 82-kilometer stretch of 
the border out of a total of 158 kilometers. 
  The cost of the work was originally estimated at 9.2 million 
kroons, of which 2.3 million has been spent. 
  A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, told BNS that, if the work is suspended, resuming it 
will cost Estonia an additional 4 million to 4.5 million kroons. 
Denmark's aid to the amount of 2.4 million Danish kroner will in 
this case also stop. 
  "Thus, it is most doubtful if stopping the construction 
saves 
the taxpayers' money," the official told BNS. 
  Under the agreement, the demarcation of the border should be 
completed by the end of 1995.

  [Text] Tallinn, January 5 -- Estonian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs made an official statement, on Wednesday, regarding 
relations of Estonia and NATO in the light of the Lithuanian 
application to join the latter, stressing the danger originating 
from non-democratic powers in Russia, and the need for closer 
ties between Central and East European states, including 
Estonia, and NATO. 
  "Estonia is monitoring very closely the developments in 
Russia and the directions of Russian foreign policy," Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs' statement says. "The result of the recent 
elections should have made it clear to the world community that 
the democratic reforms in Russia may not be irreversible." 
Therefore, it is equally important for the world community to 
"support the reformers as well as to send a clear signal that 
the policies espoused by the extremist politicians will not be 
accepted," the statement continues. 
  According to the statement, this must include "tying the 
Central and Eastern European countries closer to NATO, inter 
alia through the `Partnership for Peace', in conjunction with 
their increased ties with the European Union." 
  "As NATO enlargement should be seen in harmony with European 
integration, so should the Baltic and Visegrad states be 
included among the group of countries first to be offered the 
possibility of NATO membership," Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
statement stresses. "This approach must be coupled with an 
invitation to Russian democrats to cooperate with expanding 
European structures," it adds. 
  "Separating the Baltic and the Visegrad states, however, 
either implicitly or explicitly, could be interpreted by some 
countries as a `green light' to restore `spheres of influence'," 
the statement concludes.

  [Text] Thursday, January 6 -- The Defence Police should 
handle the section of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party in 
Estonia, Justice Minister Kaido Kama said yesterday. Kama 
referred to a claim by a Pyotr Rozhok that a section of the 
party, headed by the extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, is active 
in Estonia. Since only registered political organisations are 
allowed in Estonia and only Estonian citizens can form parties, 
the activities of the Russian Liberal Democratic party in 
Estonia are illegal, Kama stressed.

yesterday on prevention of corruption in the Armed Forces, head 
of the Defence Forces Chancellery Mart Tiru announced. 
  General Einseln based the decree on his experience in the 
U.S. Army and the analogical U.S. code, since no regulations 
determining corruption or unethical behaviour existed so far in 
the Estonian Defence Forces. The decree bans, among other 
things, exploitation of official position for personal gain and 
the making of decisions exceeding the limits of authority.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 6 -- Members of a parliamentary faction 
"For Fatherland and Freedom", have accepted a message to be 
submitted to Max Van der Stoel, the CSCE High Commissioner of 
Ethnic Minorities Affairs. The message says: 
  "The faction of deputies of the Saeima or parliament, `For 
Fatherland and Freedom', considers it necessary to call your 
attention to the fact that issues of ethnic minorities and terms 
of granting citizenship are quite different, completely separate 
things. It is recognised that `an ethnic minority' is a term 
generally applied to those citizens of a country who do not 
belong to the indigenous population of the country. The number 
of such people in Latvia equals to 365,043 which amounts to more 
than 20 percent of the total of citizens. They are granted all 
citizen rights, moreover, the minority groups are also given 
large opportunities to develop their cultural autonomy. Thus 
there is no particular problems with ethnic minorities in 
Latvia." 
  "Meanwhile Latvia does face problems concerned with foreign 
nationals which have come to this country during the years of 
occupation, and their descendants. In violation of 
internationally recognised laws the invader country, the former 
Soviet Union, has brought a vast number of its civilians into 
the occupied country. Russia, which nominally has taken over the 
commitments of the former Soviet Union, is seeking to put an 
international pressure on Latvia in a bid to make it legalize 
consequences of occupation and colonization, instead of 
providing means for repatriation of the people transferred here 
under the occupation. Regrettably, those groundless claims have 
been met with understanding and encouragement also in some 
influential international bodies, as it is shown by your 
recommendations to Latvia, which would help to maintain 
political influence of Moscow here, endorsing it to pursue 
criminal policy of Stalin and Hitler. The faction 'For 
Fatherland and Freedom' calls on you to not only to counsel 
Latvia, but also to exercise your authority to ensure the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to voice as 
strong a support to repatriation of the persons transferred to 
Latvia under the occupation, as it is voting to the demand for 
Russian troops pull-out, as well as to provide a wide political 
and financial aid to the process." 
  One of the reasons for writing the letter was the fact that 
the high commissioner who is visiting Latvia, has scheduled 
meetings with representatives of various factions of the Latvian 
parliament, but he, incidentally, failed to slate talks with the 
faction "Fatherland and Freedom."

  [Text] Riga, Jan 6 -- On January 5, the CSCE High 
Commissioner on Ethnic Minorities issues, Max Van der Stoel, 
visited the Latvian parliament. He met with the Saeima's 
[parliament] deputy chairman, Aivars Berkis, and with 
representatives from various fractions. The guest was mainly 
interested in the solution of the question of citizenship in 
Latvia. Mr. Berkis pointed out that the bill passed in its first 
reading is the basis of further work on the bill on citizenship 
which should ensure survival of the Latvian nation. At present, 
there are 1.7 million citizens in the Republic of Latvia. 79 per 
cent of them are Latvians. Max Van der Stoel pointed out that he 
understands the necessity of the use of such criteria for 
granting citizenship as the knowledge of the Latvian language 
and residence in Latvia within a certain number of years. 
According to Max Van der Stoel, Latvian citizenship should not 
be granted to people who, holding high posts, acted against 
Latvia's interests. However, he cannot understand the necessity 
of using the system of quotas. At the end of the talk, Mr. 
Berkis pointed out that it is impossible to form a two-community 
society in Latvia. Max Van der Stoel reminded that in the 
previous year, 10,000 representatives from other nationalities 
left Latvia and there is no reason for thinking that their 
number will increase in future.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 6 -- On January 5, the Latvian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs released a statement saying that the leaders 
of the Baltic States and governments have repeatedly reiterated 
their common wish to strengthen their ties with NATO. The 
Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Latvia welcomes the 
initiative of the Republic of Lithuania to join the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). A positive solution of the 
question will be a serious step in strengthening the European 
and local security. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia 
appeals to all states of NATO to grant real guarantees of 
stability and security which can be offered by the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization to the countries displaying their 
wish to integrate in NATO. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia 
approves the programme of NATO's active cooperation with the 
Baltic states. According to the Foreign Ministry, cooperation 
with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its separate 
members in political questions and the questions of security is 
an essential foreign priority of the Republic of Latvia in a 
gradual integration in political and military structures of 
NATO. The Latvian Foreign Ministry appeals to all states of NATO 
to promote the formation of necessary preconditions for the 
possibly quickest joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
by Latvia.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] The press center of the Latvian government reported 
to Interfax that the Cabinet of Ministers had prepared an 
official answer regarding Russia's proposals on the conditions 
of troop withdrawal set forth at the interstate negotiations in 
November 1993. 
  IF Note: The Russian party expressed its readiness to 
withdraw Russian troops from Latvia by August 31, 1994, under 
the provision that the radar station in the village of Skrunda 
would be preserved for 6 more years until a comparable facility 
was built in Russia. The radar station in Skrunda was built in 
1967. It consists of four space tracking antennas, each 250 
meters long, which allows monitoring of practically all of 
Europe and the North Atlantic. 
  The Latvian government has commissioned the state delegation 
at the negotiations with Russia to agree to the time of the 
troops' final withdrawal, namely August 31, 1994. However, it 
believes that the treaty on the status of the radar station must 
provide for conditions of its exploitation only during its 
dismantling, but this is not reflected in the draft document 
prepared by the Russian party. 
  The governmental press center reported that the Latvian 
party 
insists that dismantling of the reinforced concrete building of 
the station start immediately after the agreement is set into 
force, at the same time the station's major functional element, 
the detector, would continue its work. 
  The government has also decided to propose an alternative 
time to use this site, however it will officially announce its 
proposal only by the beginning of the next round of 
Latvian-Russian talks. In addition, Latvia will propose its 
rent payment for the exploitation of the station. 
  The government's press secretary, Sergey Antsupov, declared 
to Interfax that "the presence of alternative proposals and 
additional issues should not be viewed as Latvia's intention to 
torpedo Russia's initiatives." 
  Meanwhile, Latvian scientists and biologists believe that 
the 
republic must present a report to Russia due to the harmful 
influence on people and the environment exerted by this 
strategic radar station in Skrunda. 
  A report of the scientific council of Latvian Academy of 
Sciences' Biology Institute points out that "the detector's 
electromagnetic radiation adversely affects people's nervous 
system, disturbs their sleep, and results in a state of 
depression and lowering of people's working abilities." The 
report also enumerates data testifying to the detector's 
negative influence on flora and fauna. The scientists believe 
that further existence of the radar station on Latvian territory 
is inadmissible.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 05, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs emphasized in an interview that Latvia is ready for 
all-round cooperation with Estonia and Lithuania. 
  During Birkavs' term of office, Baltic cooperation at the 
highest level has quickly developed, but also strong competition 
has sprung up. There are disagreements on building an oil 
terminal and on cooperation between aviation companies. 
  The Latvian premier regarded the oil terminal construction 
as 
the main problem at present. He added that Latvia and Lithuania 
have considered the option of building the terminal in the 
Latvian port of Liepaja instead of Butinge in Lithuania, and 
that Lithuania has already taken steps to implement the plan. 
  Birkavs recalled that, during the recent discussion in the 
United Nations of a resolution on human rights violations in the 
Baltic states, Latvia threw its backing behind Estonia. "We 
decided that we'd rather risk a common defeat than proceed from 
different positions," he said. 
  Commenting on the border question, Birkavs underlined that 
"Latvia doesn't intend to dig any ditches on its boundaries with 
Estonia and Lithuania." He said the three countries have reached 
agreement that only people entering any one of the states are 
checked on the border. Plans for a common Baltic economic space 
and for consolidating the border with Russia are under work, the 
premier added. 
  With regard to the Petseri and the Abrene regions, Birkavs 
said the issue has to be solved at interstate negotiations. 
Latvia and Russia disagree about the jurisdiction over the 
Abrene region similarly to the Estonian-Russian disagreement 
over the Petseri region. 
  Asked about the weapons of the Latvian armed forces, the 
premier said approaching NATO doesn't necessarily mean that arms 
used by NATO have to be taken into use. He attached top priority 
however to abandoning the former Soviet standards and 
guaranteeing the security of the state. 
  Birkavs said Latvia, too, is negotiating an arms deal with 
Israel, and that the country hopes for credit from Israel on 
favorable terms. Birkavs claimed the question will be solved 
this year.

  [Text] A statement was made by the Lithuanian Conservative 
party, Tevynes Sajunga [Motherland's Union], spokesman for the 
press concerning Russia's official reaction to Lithuania's wish 
to join NATO. 
  The statement reads that the statement made on 5 January of 
this year by the press secretary of the Russian president 
recognizes Lithuania's right to be concerned about her own 
security and that Russia respects this right. Now this right is 
being implemented by an official request to be admitted to NATO, 
however, Russia's regrets about bloc psychology should be 
addressed to Russia itself because Russia was the first to take 
up the initiative to restore the post-Soviet military bloc, 
which, after Belarus had been included, was threateningly 
approaching Lithuanian state borders. 
  According to Vytautas Landsbergis, Chairman of the 
Lithuanian 
Conservatives Tevynes Sajunga, Europe and NATO should note that 
the military bloc dominated by Russia today is just 30 
kilometers from the capital of Lithuania. Belarus alone 
declared having 100,000 men in its Armed Forces, and what about 
the Russian military units in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Region? 
  Therefore, Lithuania has very good reason to be concerned 
for 
the expansion of the new Eastern military bloc, especially in 
view that regrettably the Belarus Government and the members of 
parliament have renounced the neutrality that was solemnly 
declared earlier. 
  Russia's neighbors are also not less concerned about the 
openly aggressive Russia's new military doctrine. Assurances 
that this doctrine allegedly blocks the way to any 
manifestations of aggression in Russian foreign policy 
absolutely contradict the text of the above doctrine and the 
real actions. The illegal deployment of Russian troops in 
Latvia and Estonia and Russia's avoidance of carrying out its 
international obligations in the region is a continuation of the 
1940 aggression. Actions of the Russian troops in the Caucasus 
and Moldavia and threats and pressure exerted on her neighbors 
are the everyday examples of this deplorable policy. 
  We hope that the democratic forces in Russia will rally and 
become stronger dissociating themselves from the aggressive 
nationalism towards people of other nationalities and the 
neighbors, the statement by the Tevynes Sajunga -- Lithuanian 
Conservatives -- reads.

<F P=106> [Article by Justinas Karosas, chairman of the Lithuanian </F>
Democratic Labor Party, LDDP, faction in the Seimas: "Where 
Will Russia Turn?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Certainly, Lithuania is 
particularly concerned over the political situation that has 
emerged in Russia after the elections. We cannot alone rely on 
the authority that the new Russian constitution grants to 
President B. Yeltsin to exercise a large influence on the 
country's foreign and domestic policies. There is no doubt that 
B. Yeltsin, being under pressure from the militant wing of the 
legislature, will make certain compromises that will have a 
negative effect on the Baltic states. It is difficult to 
predict today what definite moves will be made in this 
direction. It is clear, however, that our currently complicated 
relations with the great neighbor will be even more complex. 
Therefore, our policy toward Russia must be better considered 
and adequately diplomatic. 
  First of all, we must take more intensive care of the 
integration of Lithuania, as well as of other Baltic states, 
with West European security structures. This, of course, does 
not mean Lithuania's militarization, but only a protective 
umbrella against any aggression. I think that the first 
significant move in this direction was made last Wednesday [15 
December] during a meeting of the three Baltic presidents in 
Tallinn. The presidents clearly formulated and expressed the 
desire of their countries to integrate with West European 
security structures. It is probable that West European 
countries will also become more attentive to the wishes of the 
Baltic states after the change in Russia's political situation. 
  The second problem that we should consider seriously today 
is 
the possible economic pressure on our country. After the 
collapse of the monopoly of Russia's Government as the sole 
manager of production, private business structures, out of pure 
economic interest, will do business with those who will bring a 
higher profit. 
  Under political pressure, economic ties with Russia may 
become more complicated. Therefore, it is vital for Lithuania 
to look for alternatives in other countries. The advancement of 
the construction of the oil terminal becomes simply crucial 
within this context. 
  To put it short, Lithuania, as well as other Baltic states, 
must closely observe events in Russia today and speed up its 
integration into Western Europe by all possible measures; 
certainly, by maintaining normal relations with all neighbors.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Energy Minister Algimantas </F>
Stasiukynas by Terese Smaroviene; place and date not given: "A 
New Dilemma: Liepaja or Butinge?" --first two paragraphs are 
TIESA introduction] 
  [Text] During the meeting of the three Baltic prime 
ministers on Friday [17 December] in Vilnius, Lithuanian Prime 
Minister A. Slezevicius and his Latvian counterpart V. Birkavs 
signed a protocol of intentions on the construction of an oil 
terminal and an oil pipeline in Liepaja, and on the delivery of 
oil products to the refinery in Mazeikiai, which has already 
evoked a reaction. The positive implementation of these 
intentions, most probably, does not satisfy the opposition. 
This project was criticized on the radio by A. Vaisnoras, 
member of the Seimas [parliament] Environmental Protection 
Committee. 
  TIESA's correspondent Terese Smaroviene has spoken with 
Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas about a new turn in the 
story of the oil terminal. 
  [Smaroviene] Mister Minister, will we really discard the 
Butinge option if we reach an agreement with the Latvians on the 
construction of a joint oil terminal at the former military port 
of Liepaja? 
  [Stasiukynas] This will probably be the case. If we reach a 
final agreement on the construction of the terminal in Liepaja, 
it would be unwise to build an identical object in Butinge. We 
do not need two terminals. 
  [Smaroviene] When will the community be able to learn which 
option has been chosen? 
  [Stasiukynas] By 15 January of next year. The protocol of 
intentions states that Lithuania and Latvia agree to consider 
the issue of the construction of a joint export-import 
enterprise. The responsible executor of the project in 
Lithuania is the Energy Ministry, and its responsible manager -- 
B. Vainora, deputy energy minister and managing director of the 
"Nafta" refinery in Mazeikiai. 
  In Latvia, this project will be reviewed by its Energy 
Ministry and the government. The latter will have to assign to 
the joint enterprise port facilities situated in the area of the 
Liepaja port, and the land necessary for the construction of the 
terminal and the pipeline to Mazeikiai. As I have mentioned, 
everything must be coordinated by 15 January. If the 
preliminary documents are not ready, or if we fail to reach an 
agreement by that date, the work in Butinge will continue. 
  [Smaroviene] Suppose, we choose the Liepaja option -- the 
conditions satisfy Lithuania, and the guarantees are firm. How 
will the stock holding be divided? 
  [Stasiukynas] This issue is included in the protocol of 
intentions. Lithuania would have a 51-percent share, while 
Latvia would have 49 percent. 
  [Smaroviene] Which option -- Butinge or Liepaja -- is 
cheaper? 
  [Stasiukynas] Undoubtedly, the construction of the terminal 
in Liepaja is less expensive for us. It would cost $50 million 
less than the Butinge terminal, because we would not have to 
build facilities in the sea -- they already exist. Thus, the 
terminal itself would be installed much faster. We must build a 
floating platform nine kilometers off the coast in Butinge, 
while in Liepaja everything is ready. The only thing that 
remains there is to clean the port area that has been neglected 
for many years. That would cost about $1 million. 
  [Smaroviene] How would you comment on current talks that a 
terminal in Liepaja will allegedly tie us to Russia? 
  [Stasiukynas] Liepaja is at the Baltic Sea rather than on 
the 
border with Russia. Tankers can sail to the port from any 
country. By the way, Latvia's proposal is assessed quite 
differently abroad. Recently, I met with the representatives of 
the EC and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
in London, who think that the bank's financing for this 
Lithuanian-Latvian project is guaranteed. In their opinion, 
this will be the first European object in the Baltic states. 
  [Smaroviene] In your opinion, why did the Latvians propose 
the Liepaja port as the site for the terminal so unexpectedly? 
Why were there no such proposals before the beginning of the 
work in Butinge? 
  [Stasiukynas] Our neighbors must have thought that we would 
not build this terminal. There probably would not have been any 
proposal, if the competition for the Butinge project had not 
begun. When it became clear that Lithuania is determined to have 
its own oil terminal, the Latvians proposed their option which 
we are considering very cautiously and thoroughly. 
  [Smaroviene] We, the Lithuanians, do not seem very serious. 
At one time, we discuss the issue of Ventspils, while later we 
become tempted by our neighbors' new proposal, despite having 
begun a project of our own facility.... 
  [Stasiukynas] Ventspils is a past stage that had many 
negative points, while Liepaja is a new and clean port. Why 
should we not take advantage of it if this is beneficial? 
  [Smaroviene] You have mentioned the guarantees that the 
Latvian Government is granting to our state in the construction 
of the oil terminal and the maintenance of the Liepaja port. 
  [Stasiukynas] The construction of such an important joint 
venture requires the guarantees that the tax system and other 
conditions will not change. A country in which that enterprise 
is located can invent various obstacles. However, these issues 
are solvable. There is an international legal practice. The 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has pledged to 
send its consultants who will draft such an international 
agreement. 
  [Smaroviene] Thank you for the interview. We will be looking 
forward to 15 January 1994.

<F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 409] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 6 (ELTA) -- Lithuanian Premier Adolfas 
Slezevicius gave his first news conference after his holidays in 
Florida on January 6. He commented on the state budget of 1994 
and expressed his satisfaction about the fact that a possibility 
had been found to finance restoration of historical buildings. 
Then Slezevicius returned to current problems. 
  At present one of the major problems is the forthcoming 
farmers' strike in February. Slezevicius said that he had met 
with the chairman of the strike committee Jonas Ciulevicius just 
before the news conference. At the meeting which lasted about 
an hour possibilities of avoiding the strike were discussed. 
  "The right to go on strike is guaranteed by the 
Constitution, 
but the organizers of the strike must know that they have no 
right to force farmers to go on strike and stop supplying 
processing enterprises with produce. The fact that strikers 
will take their produce to market places instead of processing 
enterprises shows that this action could hardly be called a 
strike as they had a similar right before", Slezevicius said. 
  Another important problem is the construction of the oil 
terminal. Slezevicius emphasized that the construction of the 
oil terminal in Liepaja did not mean that another terminal would 
not be built in Butinge. Slezevicius told the press once again 
that if the terminal is build in Liepaja, Lithuania should have 
the controlling block of shares, that is 51 percent of capital. 
In addition, Lithuania should get some land in the port 
territory for building the joint-venture as well as some land 
for construction of the oil pipeline to Mazeikiai. The final 
decision on the issue should be adopted next week in Liepaja at 
the meeting of Lithuanian and Latvian state delegations.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 06, BNS -- Lithuanian Energy Minister 
Algimantas Stasiukynas once again denied accusations of allowing 
to import and to use toxic fuel in Lithuania. 
  It is strange that lawmakers have no idea of who is 
responsible for what and direct their interpolation "to the 
wrong address," Stasiukynas said at a press conference Wednesday 
[5 January]. 
  The parliament's rightist opposition demands to take a vote 
of confidence in the minister for allegedly allowing to burn 
toxic fuel in boiler houses of several Lithuanian towns and 
regions. The opposition said the step resulted in numerous 
gas-poisoning cases. 
  Stasiukynas said Absorbent A-1, the toxic fuel used in some 
areas, will be collected and stored in a special reservoir of 
the Elektrenai thermal electric power station. The minister said 
there are several ways to get rid of the fuel. Experts suggest 
either to burn it at the Akmene cement factory and in 
Elektrenai, or to take the absorbent out of the country. 
  The minister said poisonous substances are emitted only when 
the fuel is burned in low temperatures. In theory, toxic 
substances should also be emitted when the absorbent is burned 
in high temperatures, but laboratory tests proved the opposite, 
he said. Additional tests will reportedly be made in the West. 
  Stasiukynas said Tuesday that the fuel was unlawfully 
imported by the Lithuania-USA company Lamaringas and sold to the 
state-run company Siluma (Heat). The importer forged customs 
documents, which indicated a different kind of fuel, he said. 
  The first warning signals came from the Environmental 
Protection Department last May. Stasiukynas said his ministry 
immediately began a search for places where the fuel was used. 
All absorbent users were known by July-August and all 
reservoirs containing the fuel were sealed. The minister said 
the only incident occurred in the town of Kelme where some fuel 
spilled through a leaky pipe.

<F P=106> [Article by Jonas Uzurka, chief of staff at the Vilnius </F>
division of the Volunteer National Defense Service: "Farewell 
to SKAT"] 
  [Excerpts]Lithuanian Prime Minister A. Slezevicius 
has confirmed to RESPUBLIKA that a presidential decree is being 
drafted which will reorganize the Volunteer National Defense 
Service [SKAT]. It seems that it will be restructured as the 
National Guards, and the name of SKAT will disappear. "The SKAT 
has required changes for a long time. However, everything will 
be planned and accomplished consistently. We will try to do our 
best to prevent the sad events in the woods near Kaunas 
[reference to volunteer mutiny] from recurring," said A. 
Slezevicius. A detailed plan of reorganization has already been 
drafted at the National Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces 
Staff. Today we are publishing an article by Jonas Uzurka, 
chief of staff at the SKAT Vilnius division. 
  Many Lithuanian citizens become concerned when they see a 
man, wearing an indefinite uniform and a red beret with the 
national emblem, in the street. Many foreigners are terrified 
when they see a volunteer, dressed the same way, but armed and 
usually drunk, at the airport. [passage omitted] 
  People fail to understand the extent of such disorder in the 
SKAT. In my opinion, the principal reason for this is that the 
SKAT was created and managed by people who ignore military 
discipline. The most important issue for them was to get cushy 
positions for themselves and their acquaintances. Therefore, 
they invited "like- minded" persons to assume positions, the 
number of which was exaggerated immoderately, awarded ranks and 
orders to themselves, and engaged in commercial activities 
shamelessly. Where have you seen an officer working as a 
marketer!? Is it possible to train a volunteer to defend the 
homeland if the facilities of the SKAT division in Vilnius are 
leased to 17 commercial firms alone? We need not be surprised 
that volunteers guard commercial stalls rather than warehouses 
with ammunition. 
  Currently, the SKAT has about 1,000 full-time employees, 
while there were only some 500 of them in the National Defense 
Ministry between the wars. This may be why SKAT employees react 
so noisily to any criticism and accuse critics of destructive 
communist activities for their word of truth immediately. 
  "Honor" trials for honest volunteers are becoming more 
frequent. [passage omitted] 
  Therefore, the reorganization of the SKAT is essential. 
According to the plan, the number of its full-time jobs will be 
reduced to 500. One should understand at last that not a single 
military formation can be beyond the law, and that commerce is 
not an officer's job. It is only when the armed forces are 
isolated from politics, and when soldiers obey the statutes and 
laws alone, that the Lithuanian people will believe that they 
see a defender of the homeland rather than an armed criminal. 
Let those who are unable or unwilling to submit to the military 
discipline engage in trade, but not in military activities. 
This will be more beneficial to the community. 
  Despite the current commotion over the SKAT, I hope that we 
will have real, disciplined, and honorable defense structures 
shortly.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Social Security Minister </F>
Mindaugas Stankevicius by Jolanta Zilinskaite; place and date 
not given: "The State -- Not an Aunt From America"] 
  [Excerpts] New Minister Mindaugas Stankevicius has headed 
the Social Security Ministry for a month already. He has told 
TIESA's reporter Jolanta Zilinskaite about his first official 
duties. 
  [Zilinskaite] It is said that a new broom sweeps clean. 
With what duties did you begin work in your new position? 
  [Stankevicius] I am continuing the work begun by others. I 
have participated in the creation and restructuring of the 
social security system for several years. Although being pushed 
around as a chess piece, an individual enjoyed a minimum of 
security in socialist times. As we are trying to move toward a 
modern market economy, we must understand that all principles of 
social security are changing in essence. A human being must 
begin to provide for himself or herself, while the key task of 
the state is to help those who really cannot survive without its 
assistance. Our country is still very poor. Thus, we cannot 
pay such benefits to unemployed people all year round as in 
other states, which would be sufficient to live on. 
  The Seimas [parliament] and the government must draft 
definite laws, while a person should receive assistance at his 
or her place of residence. So, we want to assist local 
self-governments in organizing such work. We think that local 
social security services should expand such activities more 
actively. We have definite proposals how to help them. The 
state has assigned some means for this, while the EC, which is 
ready to help us, has promised to supply the aforementioned 
services with computers through the PHARE [Poland and Hungary 
Action for Restructuring the Economy]. This is one of such 
broader initiatives, while my everyday work is routine. 
Although much criticized, the social insurance system "Sodra," 
is doing its work, as well as the labor exchange. Services for 
retraining of adults encounter more difficulties. They should 
help jobless people react quickly to the current situation -- to 
either improve their skills, learn new jobs, or engage in 
private business. It is very important that the State Labor 
Inspection get down to serious work, because many job injuries, 
accidents, and occupational diseases still occur in Lithuania, 
and a "black" labor market is emerging, where the people are 
unprotected. 
  I agree with the criticism that social security is not 
sufficiently balanced. There are many pressing problems that 
are even hard to list. For example, we compensate part of the 
expenses for urban pensioners, while rural pensioners who buy 
expensive fuel do not have such compensation. [passage omitted] 
  [Zilinskaite]Does state assistance reach primarily 
those who require it most of all? What is to be done to prevent 
those who can earn a living on their own from collecting 
benefits? 
  [Stankevicius] The larger part of assistance really reaches 
such people. However, there are different cases. I think that 
one or another trader from Gariunai [large market-place in the 
suburbs of Vilnius] receives unemployment benefits from the 
Labor Exchange. 
  What must be done to prevent this? First of all, the state 
must have such a mechanism that would assess the real income of 
each citizen. The law on the declaration of income is, 
probably, the best outcome. However, this is not so simple. 
Therefore, we do not intend to idle about. We are drafting 
proposals to toughen existing laws. 
  [Zilinskaite] People's life is hard, while the state 
budget coffers are empty. There are no means for supporting all 
those who cannot earn a living. While the Seimas is debating 
the budget for next year, I would like to ask you whether there 
are any possibilities for assigning more money from the budget 
for the poor? 
  [Stankevicius] Even if all of next year's budget was 
earmarked for social security, this sum would not be too large. 
Seriously speaking, the social sector receives about 43 percent 
of the budget money. This includes both health care and 
education, because all three of these issues mean social 
security. 
  We must help the needy. However, the most important issue 
today is to create conditions for profitable jobs. Currently, 
about 7 percent of Lithuanian residents receive the lowest 
reward, that is, 48 litai a month. We are often reprimanded for 
this. Even the average pension is only 103 litai. Certainly, 
we could increase the minimum wage to 90-100 litai. However, if 
they become mandatory, no one would be able to pay less, and the 
number of jobless people would climb several times. That is why 
we are discussing which is better -- to leave people without 
work straight away or allow them to earn something, because we 
have no means to support the unemployed. Neither of these 
options are good! 
  [Zilinskaite] It looks like the number of jobs will 
drop considerably next year. How are you going to create new 
jobs? 
  [Stankevicius] The official current figure of jobless people 
in Lithuania is 30,800. However, that is only the tip of the 
iceberg -- many people work part-time, some of them are on leave 
without pay, while others simply do not apply to the employment 
office and earn a living anyway they can. 
  I think that the restructuring of industry will bring many 
enterprises to bankruptcy in the near future. We are preparing 
for mass unemployment. I pray that our predictions do not come 
true. I suppose, however, that we may have about 200,000 
jobless people by the end of the coming year. The experience of 
most countries shows that the constant unemployment rate is 
about 10 percent. The same is likely to inevitably occur here, 
at least until the economy gets back on its feet. 
  Private structures must create new jobs. The possibilities 
of the state are very much restricted. Therefore, it is 
necessary to grant credits and tax privileges to businessmen, 
and create the most favorable conditions for foreign 
investments. Employment is the outcome of the state's economic 
policy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At today's news conference by the prime minister, 
journalists were informed that the government has decided to 
increase pensions and wages of officials at institutions 
maintained from the budget from 1 January. 
  The prime minister said this will not completely compensate 
for December's price increases but it is something. According 
to Adolfas Slezevicius, inflation was 6.2 percent in December.

  [Text] Leaders of six opposition parties signed a joint 
statement on the state of emergency law which is currently under 
discussion by the Lithuanian Seimas, ELTA reported. 
  The statement reads that some articles which have already 
been adopted by the vote of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
party faction are a challenge to the constitutional state system 
of the Republic of Lithuania. With the help of the law on state 
of emergency the Lithuanian Democratic Labor party creates 
conditions for itself to be able to suspend the functioning of 
essential clauses of the constitution on the decision of the 
party's faction alone on the pretext that it poses a threat to 
the public order, thus to violate basic human rights and 
freedoms, to introduce the dictatorship of their party by means 
of allegedly legal actions of coercion. 
  We stress, the statement goes on, that the right of the 
nation and of every citizen to oppose anyone who encroaches on 
the constitutional state system is inalienable. 
  The statement was signed by the leaders of the Lithuanian 
Democrats party, the Lithuanian Christian Democrats Party, the 
Independence Party, the Lithuanian Liberal Party, the Lithuanian 
Nationalist Union and the Lithuanian Conservative Party.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Lithuania's unfriendly 
statements about Kaliningrad Oblast cause bewilderment and could 
complicate Lithuanian-Russian relations. This was said at a 
briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the department 
of information and the press of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in 
connection with the latest statements by some Lithuanian 
politicians who have called for the "demilitarization" and 
"deoccupation" of Kaliningrad Oblast, for a review of its 
international status, and for it to be removed from Russia by 
forming on its territory "a new Baltic republic integrated into 
the structures of Northern Europe." 
  In connection with this the Russian diplomat recalled that 
the decision of the Potsdam Conference on transferring 
Kaliningrad Oblast to the Soviet Union was final and without any 
time limit. The territorial possession of the oblast by the 
Soviet Union and consequently by Russia was subsequently laid 
down in the treaty on the final settlement in relation to 
Germany of 12 September 1990 and the treaty on 
good-neighborliness, partnership, and cooperation between the 
USSR and the FRG of 9 November 1990. "Thus, juridically and by 
right of morality and history Kaliningrad Oblast is an 
inalienable, integral part of Russia, and Russia will not permit 
a review of the international legal acts establishing and 
confirming its present status," he stressed.

  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- A Russian high-ranking 
official will arrive in Latvia next week to discuss a draft 
agreement on the status of the disputed radar station in 
Skrunda, Grigoriy Karasin, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, 
told a briefing in Moscow on Thursday. 
  Sergey Zotov, who heads the Russian delegation to the talks 
with Latvia, will arrive in Riga on January 10 to discuss a 
draft agreement on the radar station after the Russian troops 
have left Latvian territory. 
  Karasin said that the absence of such an agreement hampers 
the signing of the prepared main document which sets the 
deadline of the troop withdrawal and two other agreements on 
social welfare of the Army personnel and the retired military 
and members of their families.

  [Text] Spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy 
Karasin has described the latest developments in the zone of the 
Azeri-Armenian conflict as more bloodshed and another attempt to 
settle the conflict by force. This is taking place in 
conditions when the world community, including Russia, proposed 
real possibilities for the bloodless solution of disputed 
problems by peaceful means, the spokesman told a briefing in 
Moscow January 6. 
  Karasin said that over the past two weeks the Azeri armed 
forces were fighting to liberate some of the republic's regions 
earlier captured by units of the Karabakh Armenians. There are 
widespread hostilities around Nagorno-Karabakh with heavy 
casualties. 
  The spokesman drew the attention of journalists to the two 
sides' mutual accusations of responsibility for the resumption 
of fighting, shelling and new offensives. This is not 
infrequently close to manipulating the public opinion and 
non-critically reproduced by the media causing misinformation, 
said the diplomat. He believes the propagandist war only 
aggravates the profound mutual mistrust between the conflicting 
sides. 
  The spokesman has voiced regret that Baku rejected the 
proposals of its Russian mediator put forward on December 16 and 
20 on a temporary cease-fire which would create more favorable 
conditions for signing an agreements on ending hostilities.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan -- Continuing to occupy a position of 
noninterference in the conflict inside Afghanistan, Russia calls 
on all sides involved to display restraint, to reject actions 
using force, and to seek political compromises for the sake of 
national consolidation. This was stated by Grigoriy Karasin, 
director of the information and press department of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, at a briefing today. 
  He noted that Russia views with deep concern recent events 
in 
Afghanistan, the flaring up of armed clashes in Kabul and in the 
north of the country which have already caused numerous 
casualties, including among the civilian population. It is 
evident that such a development can only further intensify the 
polarization of the forces in Afghan society, make the prospects 
for restoring peace in Afghanistan even more remote, and 
seriously complicate the situation on the southern frontier of 
the CIS and in the region as whole, the Russian Federation 
Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed. 
  Together with other states and the United Nations, Russia is 
prepared to assist the process of achieving an Afghan 
settlement. Grigoriy Karasin said getting such a settlement 
going and furthering it would correspond to the common interests 
of the whole of the international community.

  [Begin Karasin recording] About the plans of the Russian 
side 
as chairman of the Commonwealth of Independent States: In 
connection with the decision of the Ashgabat meeting of CIS 
heads of state, that the Russian Federation would, at the 
present stage, take the chair in the main bodies of the CIS, the 
Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry is beginning to work 
out proposals for specific ways of the future development of the 
CIS. These proposals, that are based on results already 
achieved within the Commonwealth, cover the following main 
areas: Establishing the mechanisms for an economic alliance; 
ensuring human rights and the rights of minorities throughout 
the CIS, and creating mechanisms to guarantee these rights; 
restoring cultural, scientific, and educational ties between the 
Commonwealth countries; creating a unified humanitarian space; 
shaping an effective system of collective security, with the 
stress on peacekeeping functions; developing practical 
mechanisms of the CIS to prevent armed conflicts; ensuring 
greater effectiveness for joint action by members of the 
Commonwealth in the foreign-political sphere in the development 
of cooperation between the CIS, the United Nations, the CSCE, 
and other international organizations. 
  The corresponding ministries and departments will take part 
in drawing up these proposals. The Foreign Ministry also 
intends to draw in the representatives of scientific circles and 
public organizations. These proposals will be submitted to the 
Russian leadership, and then Russia, as the current chairman of 
the CIS, will table them for examination by the other 
Commonwealth member states. [end recording]

  Speaking to journalists before the meeting began, B. Clinton 
said that discussion of his proposed "Partnership for Peace" 
concept, which provides for the phased integration of East 
European countries in NATO, must be one of the main themes on 
the agenda at the upcoming Brussels conference of NATO 
countries' leaders. However, according to the U.S. President, it 
would be premature to start talking abut the possibility of 
giving Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic full membership 
status in NATO right now. 
  "I am not opposed to expanding NATO," the head of the White 
House stressed. However, from what he said "there is no accord" 
at the moment among the organization members as to the 
expediency of accepting East European countries. "Therefore, 
following many decades of work to abolish the `boundary' 
dividing Europe, we do not want to create the impression that we 
are aspiring to a new division of the continent," Clinton said. 
"We favor a secure and stable Europe. At the same time, I 
believe that sooner or later the `Partnership for Peace' concept 
will lead to an expansion of NATO." 
  When asked whether in his view the implementation of this 
concept would lead to the integration of all European states, 
including Russia, in the North Atlantic Alliance, the U.S. 
President said: "I hope that ultimately all European countries 
will clearly and unequivocally put themselves in the hands of a 
peaceful, stable, and secure Europe, whose states will respect 
each other's borders." 
  "We cannot simply move the Berlin Wall several hundred miles 
to the East," General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated at a White House news conference 
Tuesday. He warned against "creating a division" in Europe 
again, whether "deliberately or unintentionally," and expressed 
his opposition to expanding NATO at present by including former 
Warsaw Pact states. 
  Speaking to journalists on the same day, U.S. presidential 
national security adviser Anthony Lake stressed that the United 
States is committed to the "evolutionary" process and is 
avoiding drawing "new demarcating lines" right now between East 
and West in Europe. The hasty acceptance of East European 
countries into NATO could lead to the destabilization of the 
region and "would be an involuntary confirmation of pessimistic 
predictions in respect of Russia," was the way he explained 
Washington's official viewpoint. This, in his opinion, would not 
be in line with "either NATO's interests or the interests of the 
states of Central and East Europe." Lake deemed it necessary to 
stress that this position enjoys the support of President Bill 
Clinton.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Drobkov: "Washington Shows </F>
Leadership"] 
  [Text] Washington, 5 Jan -- In a few days' time Bill 
Clinton sets off on his first "presidential" tour of Europe. On 
Saturday 8 January he flies from Washington to Brussels. There 
the head of the U.S. Administration will attend the NATO Council 
winter session and meet with the leaders of the European Union. 
On 11 January the U.S. President is to meet with the leaders of 
Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in Prague. From 12 
through 15 January Bill Clinton makes his first official visit 
to Russia, and then to Belarus. Then he goes to Geneva, to meet 
with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Such a busy program for the U.S. President's European tour 
would appear to be intended to demonstrate an active U.S. 
foreign policy and Washington's leadership following the end of 
the Cold War. At the same time Clinton intends to "pay his 
respects" to Europe, whose problems, obviously, were pushed into 
the background by domestic political concerns during the first 
year of his presidency. 
  Brussels is intended to be the main area of U.S. foreign 
policy efforts during the visit. There Clinton will try not 
only to "revive NATO" but also to persuade his bloc allies to 
accept the U.S. vision of the future development of the 
situation in Europe and, indeed, in the world as a whole. 
  An important part of this vision is the "Partnership for 
Peace" doctrine, proclaimed a few weeks ago. The purpose of 
this doctrine is to steer the desire of a number of East 
European states to become full members of NATO as soon as 
possible in the direction the U.S. wants. While voicing support 
for these aspirations, the United States and most of its bloc 
partners are in fact not particularly enthusiastic about them. 
  The point is that, having lost their main potential enemy in 
the shape of the USSR, Washington and NATO are concerned about 
preserving the former "combat character and spirit" of this 
organization -- which the "dilution of NATO" by former members 
of the Warsaw Pact would not help at all. Moreover, there are 
fears in NATO that new members would bring to the bloc the 
chronic disputes and problems of Europe, which have come to the 
surface in the most obvious fashion in the course of the 
Yugoslav crisis and the endless war in Bosnia. 
  Finally, Washington and the other NATO capitals obviously do 
not want to "tease the Russian bear" needlessly. Indeed, the 
bloc's acceptance of Moscow's former allies might in fact be 
interpreted as a step intended to establish a new "cordon 
sanitaire" around it. The "partnership for peace" is devised in 
such a way that "no new lines are pursued in Europe," U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Oxman said. 
  It was no accident that, at a recent Washington news 
conference, senior administration spokesmen tried to demonstrate 
when pressed by East European journalists that it is not in 
their countries' interests to be trying too overtly to isolate 
Russia and that the "success of the Russian reforms" is an 
absolutely essential condition of the success of the process of 
reforms in their own countries. 
  But the calls for the bloc's doors to be flung open as soon 
as possible to new members -- former enemies -- are not 
diminishing. They have grown particularly loud, THE CHRISTIAN 
SCIENCE MONITOR notes, since the recent elections in Russia, 
which most local observers see as a defeat for the "Yeltsin 
reformers" and a victory for "nationalist, procommunist forces." 
And the Russian president's proposal on jointly guaranteeing 
with NATO the security of the East European countries appears to 
have aroused more suspicion than support. 
  The other day Polish President Lech Walesa even said that 
the West runs the risk of bringing about the revival of the 
Soviet bloc and the return of communist regimes in East Europe 
unless it takes bold steps to incorporate a number of former 
Warsaw Pact allies into NATO. It would be a "tragedy," the 
Polish president said, if the 10 January meeting of state and 
government heads in Brussels did not adopt a precise schedule 
for the admission of East European countries to the bloc. 
  In this situation the need for NATO to devise a common 
response to the East European governments' aspirations is 
particularly urgent. And to all appearances, the U.S. President 
is prepared to pull out all the stops to persuade his bloc 
allies to accept the U.S. way of solving this problem -- 
Washington's "Partnership for Peace" doctrine. But the problem 
is that this doctrine has not yet been fully formulated in an 
integrated and clear form. 
  Its general provisions could be described in a nutshell as 
follows: It offers the East European countries and the new 
independent states, as the former Soviet republics, including 
Russia, are sometimes called here, not simultaneous and proud 
entry but a stage-by-stage and somewhat humiliating process of 
"creeping" into NATO. First the door will be opened just enough 
to let in those that are "furthest advanced along the path of 
reforms." Then, others can be admitted to the select band of 
NATO members as they reach "democratic adulthood." No 
exceptions or allowances will be made for anyone -- they will 
all have to go through a long and and as yet vague process of 
adaptation. 
  At the first stage the NATO countries will have to 
obligingly 
agree to participate in joint maneuvers as "aspiring" members. 
This could be followed by closer cooperation in the security 
sphere. And only then, some observers believe, would it be 
possible to start talks on the particular form of NATO 
membership. At any stage those wishing to be admitted to the 
closed Atlantic club could face "elimination" if its original 
participants arrive at the conclusion that one of the new faces 
is not sufficiently "dedicated to democracy" or is delaying 
market reforms. 
  According to THE WASHINGTON POST, the U.S. State Department 
has already started an "intense diplomatic campaign to persuade 
skeptical East European governments to accept the evolutionary 
plans for NATO expansion, rather than seek immediate 
membership..." The main targets of the State Department's 
"attack" are Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, which are 
knocking at the bloc's door. 
  If these countries will not be persuaded by the United 
States 
and resolutely reject the "partnership" they are being offered, 
it could undermine the U.S. enterprise at the 10 January NATO 
summit, even if the bloc allies themselves approve it. Anxious 
local observers and even some "senior administration 
representatives," who traditionally wish to remain anonymous, 
are currently warning of this. 
  On the eve of Clinton's visit Madeleine Albright, U.S. 
representative to the United Nations, and John Shalikashvili, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are going to see the East 
Europeans in order to prepare them properly to take on board the 
U.S. plan. According to Anthony Lake, adviser to the president 
for national security affairs, the purpose of their trip will be 
to dispel fears that the Washington "partnership" is intended to 
delay the entry of new members into NATO, just to please the 
Russian opposition. In fact, Lake tried to show, it will lead 
in a evolutionary way to the "expansion of NATO," but not at the 
expense of a revival of an East-West split in Europe... 
  So Bill Clnton's European tour, which begins very soon, does 
not promise to be easy. In a changing world U.S. claims to 
leadership need to be constantly confirmed by specific actions 
or new ideas capable of captivating allies and partners. The 
new administration does not have too many of these in its 
foreign policy baggage at the moment.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report on interview with French Foreign </F>
Minister Alain Juppe in Paris; date not given: "Democratic 
Russia Does Not Need a Cordon Sanitaire, According to French 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe"] 
  [Text] Paris -- The outcome of the NATO summit meeting 
which is to be held in Brussels 10-11 January with the 
participation of American President Bill Clinton is 
predetermined, to judge by the statements by the political 
leaders of France and other countries. There will be no 
surprises. 
  The admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak 
Republics to NATO would not only not strengthen European 
security but could, on the contrary, exacerbate the internal 
political situation in Russia and complicate relations between 
the Western capitals and Moscow. That is Paris' position, which 
is supported on the whole by its allies. 
  "The entry of East European countries to the North Atlantic 
Alliance would be premature today. It would fundamentally alter 
the very nature of the North Atlantic Alliance, which agreement 
envisages security guarantees in the event of a bloc member's 
coming under attack," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe stated 
in conversation with your correspondent. 
  "However, I do have a positive attitude to the strengthening 
of relations between NATO and the states of East Europe and 
between NATO and Russia," the minister went on to stress in 
response to a question from IZVESTIYA; "therefore we have 
supported in principle the American Partnership for Peace 
initiative. Moreover, France and Germany intend to go further 
and to propose that East European countries become associate 
members of the Western European Union." 
  Partnership for Peace, the minister went on to explain, will 
not become a cordon sanitaire between Europe and Russia. On the 
contrary, this initiative is addressed to Moscow, whose 
participation will be only welcome. Premature membership of 
NATO for Poland, Hungary, and other countries would, on the 
contrary, play the role of a kind of cordon sanitaire. Given 
such conditions, Paris favors a more flexible form of 
cooperation with them. 
  Europe has not been a peaceful and stable continent in 
recent 
years, the minister also said. Alongside the instability in 
Russia -- our great partner --crises continue in other parts of 
Europe. Therefore it is essential that we engage first and 
foremost in preventive activity. To that end France is calling 
a conference on stability in Europe, which will take place in 
Paris in April and to which Russia and the United States have 
been invited.

especially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, under the general heading 
"NATO: From Confrontation to Partnership. This Is the Only Way 
of Reaching Agreement in East and West Europe": "While 
Politicians Argue, Czech Army Switches to NATO Regulations"] 
  [Text] Prague -- "In the past Czechoslovakia played a key 
role in winding up the Warsaw Pact -- that instrument of Soviet 
hegemony," Czech President Vaclav Havel said recently. "Our 
efforts were not only designed to eliminate the last obstacle to 
participation in the system of collective defense of European 
democracy, but were also aimed at eliminating the last obstacle 
to the North Atlantic alliance's being turned into a European 
instead of a West European structure." 
  Some politicians here were surprised that the president 
devoted the second speech to deputies during his presidency not 
to the republic's domestic political problems, but to joining 
NATO. This speech was most likely directed not at Czech 
parliamentarians but at Western politicians and Moscow. 
  What arguments did the first president of the Czech Republic 
adduce in favor of NATO membership? 
  First, the Czech Republic is at the very heart of Europe and 
is the traditional meeting point of geopolitical interests; many 
wars have begun or ended here. Incidentally, this was in the 
past one of the arguments for Czechoslovakia joining the Warsaw 
Pact. "Historical experience shows that we cannot worry only 
about ourselves, but for our own benefit we must show interest 
in the all-European process, which, whether we like it or not, 
concerns us more than other countries," Vaclav Havel believes. 
"Our endeavor to accede to the alliance is not merely a desire 
to receive international guarantees of our own security, but is 
also based on our wish to assume some responsibility for the 
situation on our continent...." 
  Second, the Czech Republic shares all the main values of 
Euroamerican civilization, including a civil society, 
parliamentary democracy, political pluralism, a rule-of-law 
state, and respect for the individual. Since NATO's task is to 
defend these values, the Czech Republic cannot remain aloof. 
  Third, based on historical experience, tragic experience 
included -- primarily Munich 1938 -- the Czech Republic feels 
the need to be included in a system of active collective 
security. 
  In Vaclav Havel's opinion, Central Europe is currently in 
the 
foreground of the struggle for democracy and stability on the 
whole continent. "I therefore believe," he said, "that the 
Central European states should logically be prime candidates for 
NATO membership." 
  The Czech president devoted a considerable portion of his 
speech to Russia: 
  "To all appearances, NATO's relations with Russia and the 
other republics of the former Soviet Union will be far more 
complex. I think that there are just two options: Democratic 
forces win victory in Russia, forces aware that NATO is not 
Russia's enemy but an extremely promising partner and that 
NATO's drawing near Russia's border does not mean the approach 
of an enemy but a zone of democracy and prosperity, and that 
this process accords with Russia's vital interests. But there 
is also another option. Forces that are unable to give up the 
imperial ambitions of the former Soviet Union, chauvinist, great 
Russian forces...may gain the upper hand in Russia -- 
temporarily of course. They would undoubtedly protest NATO's 
being expanded by the admission of the former Soviet satellites 
and the alliance's drawing closer to Russia's borders.... I 
think that the West would be making a fatal error were it to 
succumb to their pressure. That would herald a return to Yalta 
and the `cold war' period...." 
  It is hard to say whether Vaclav Havel convinced Western 
politicians, but Czech parliamentarians viewed with approval the 
-- albeit not that immediate -- prospect of acceding to the 
North Atlantic alliance. It was only J. Ortman, chairman of the 
Leftist Bloc deputies' club, who opposed the Czech Republic's 
joining any military alliance and proposed that the question of 
NATO membership not be resolved in parliament but by means of a 
national referendum. Premier Vaclav Klaus was somewhat more 
restrained than the others. In response to questions from 
TELEGRAF newspaper readers he said: 
  "I think that the question of joining NATO is not on the 
agenda now. We are still not ready for this and no one is 
offering us membership at the moment. So, it is simply 
pointless and unfeasible at the moment to raise the question of 
a referendum. But I am convinced that NATO has played, is 
playing, and will play its role in Europe, that is, the region 
where the Czech Republic is situated. From this viewpoint it 
would of course be good for us to be members of NATO." 
  Defense Minister Antonin Baudys believes that "the earlier 
we 
join NATO the better." Speaking about the October events in 
Russia in an interview with LIDOWE NOVINY he noted: "Personally 
they made me want to speed up the steps in NATO's direction. 
This was an example of the possible danger. Today NATO is the 
only functioning, well-organized military pact in the world. 
Our only chance is to get full membership thereof...." 
  But FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, during an official 
visit to Prague, recalled that the question of expanding NATO 
eastward cannot be decided without considering Russia's 
interests. "Russia is an extremely important factor for 
stability in Europe," he said during a meeting with journalists. 
"Stability can only be achieved `with' Russia but not under any 
circumstances by uniting `against' Russia." 
  Nonetheless the problem of the Czech Republic's joining NATO 
is still featuring in the Czech press. "The question of our 
secure future is today closely linked with whether Russia joins 
the West or not," PRACE wrote. "But if that does not accord 
with Russia's wishes, we cannot abandon our intention of 
becoming full-fledged members of the North Atlantic alliance." 
  A summit of all 16 NATO countries will be held in Brussels 
in 
a few days and important decisions on the bloc's future are 
expected. "If the January political decisions on the North 
Atlantic alliance's future strategy are extremely positive for 
us, that does not by any means signify that the Czech Republic 
will become a full-fledged member of this organization 
overnight," Vaclav Havel believes. "At best this will be just 
the start of a lengthy, fairly complex process...." 
  But, before the verdict is in, there is every indication 
that 
the Czech Army has already joined in this process. According to 
Major General Pavel Jandacek, deputy chief of the General Staff 
of the Czech Army, steps are being taken "to close the gap 
between us and NATO armies and structures where possible in the 
near future." In particular linguistic and professional training 
is already under way, bearing in mind the Czech Army's future in 
NATO. Over 160 officers and men have been sent to military 
schools and courses in NATO, the United States, Canada, France, 
Britain, the FRG, and Holland. 
  While the politicians are arguing, the military is acting.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov] </F>
  [Text] The summit of the presidents of Russia and the 
United States in Moscow on the 12-15 January will follow on the 
heels of the conference of leaders of NATO in Brussels, where 
the American concept of Partnership for Peace will be discussed. 
Vladislav Kozyakov examines these two events and he writes: 
  It can safely be predicted that the talks between the 
presidents of Russia and the United States, Boris Yeltsin and 
Bill Clinton, will be influenced to a very large extent by what 
happens in the two preceding days in the Belgian capital. 
  Russia is worried about information that Western leaders are 
looking into requests by a number of East European countries for 
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On 
Wednesday, an official reaction to this issue was made known by 
the publication of a statement by a presidential press 
secretary. The Russian president warned that an expansion of 
NATO might lead to a military-political destabilization in key 
regions of the world. 
  True, Washington says it does not intend at present to 
support the admission of new members into the alliance. At this 
stage, in place of full membership, America is offering the 
concept of Partnership for Peace to the newly independent states 
of Eastern Europe. 
  However, this American concept needs further clarification. 
It has not been fine-tuned, so to speak, and details have not 
been agreed between NATO's members. 
  The temporary character of the Partnership for Peace also 
deserves some attention. After a period, according to this 
American concept, all countries wishing to join NATO will be 
admitted. 
  It's paradoxical that in the changing cirsumstances of the 
present world, it's precisely NATO that is involved in 
generating a feeling of apprehension in Europe. In its time the 
establishment of this military bloc drew a corresponding 
response and led to the establishment of the Warsaw Pact. Then 
followed decades of confrontation. Now at the end of the Cold 
War, when NATO has no Warsaw Pact to contend with, it's causing 
anxiety with its prospects of an expansion of its membership and 
drawing closer to the Russian borders. 
  The question arises, Why should the stereotypes of bloc 
mentality be kept alive in Europe. If Partnership for Peace 
intends to establish a system of security in Europe, Russia 
including, then why must this system be based on a military 
organization of Western Europe. 
  This question becomes more relevant as a new actual system 
is 
already in existence. It's the Council for North Atlantic 
Cooperation, in whose ranks are NATO members as well as 
countries in the former Warsaw Pact. 
  Why should not the Partnership for Peace see as its final 
objective not admission of new members into NATO but the 
creation of an all-embracing collective security in Europe and 
in the space from Vancouver to Vladivostok, developing for this 
project the North Atlantic Cooperation Council? This would be 
quite in the spirit of the Council for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe. 
  In Moscow there is support for the American concept of 
Partnership for Peace. However, this idea must not be a 
prisoner of the bloc mentality. It must take into account the 
security interests of all governments without exception. 
Partnership for Peace should orientate itself to the creation 
of a new mechanism for the provision of security for Europe and 
the world. 
  The new time and the new situation in Europe demands a fresh 
untried approach to the problem of cementing peace and the 
development of cooperation. To act from a bloc position in this 
new era would be at least unrealistic.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan -- The Russo-U.S. consultations held 
in the U.S. capital were very successful; an agreement was 
reached on all of the main points of the program for U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's state visit and of the agenda for the 
summit meeting in Moscow, Georgiy Mamedov, the Russian 
Federation deputy foreign minister, believes. He has just 
returned here from Washington, where he discussed the program 
for the visit with Strobe Talbott, coordinator of U.S. policy 
toward Russia and the CIS countries. 
  In Georgiy Mamedov's view, the Moscow forum will devote its 
main attention to problems of economic interaction between the 
countries, and examination of a set of questions linked with the 
implementation of the policy of reform in Russian society. On 
the international level, the sides will consider the 
strengthening of security and the settlement of regional 
conflicts, particularly in Bosnia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and also 
problems of nuclear nonproliferation and cooperation in arms 
control.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yuriy Soltan] </F>
  [Text] On the invitation of the Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, the head of the Washington administration, Bill 
Clinton, will arrive in Moscow on 12 January on a state visit. 
Yuriy Solton examines the significance of this visit: 
  [Solton] It is symbolic that the new external political year 
for Russia is beginning with a meeting between Boris Yeltsin and 
Bill Clinton. This has once more refuted the speculations that 
have appeared in some media as though the Russian Government, 
embroiled in internal and other problems, considers its 
relationship with the United States less significant. 
  In Moscow, the Vancouver Declaration, under which the two 
presidents attempt to conduct their business with the aim of 
strengthening bilateral cooperation and friendship, is seen as 
an important principle. By all accounts, Washington also feels 
the same about the Vancouver Declaration. As to what meaning 
the United States of America attaches to the Russian factor can 
be gleaned from the appointment of Strobe Talbott [as] 
coordinator of American policies on Russia and other 
Commonwealth countries. 
  President Bill Clinton himself believes that the main task 
of 
his visit to Moscow is to demonstrate America's support for the 
democratic and market reforms, which are the preoccupations of 
Yeltsin and his team. He is not carrying with him any new aid 
package to Russia. The sum of $4.5 million has already been 
announced, and during the visit of the American Vice President 
Albert Gore to Moscow in December some concrete agreements were 
reached. 
  Of course, during the Moscow talks prospects for further 
development in trade and economic cooperation between the two 
countries -- which for Russia, that has entered a period of 
radical changes, is important -- will be discussed. The 
negotiations in Moscow promise to be all-embracing and concrete, 
including the issue of security, cooperation in the control of 
weapons, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and joint 
action in resolving regional conflicts. 
  It is possible that different approaches to the solution of 
all or any problem may arise, but there can be no doubt that the 
meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, designed to 
define the program of cooperation and joint actions by these two 
great countries at the end of the century and the beginning of 
the next, will become an important event in world history.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "U.S. Economists Criticize </F>
President Clinton for Indulging Yeltsin"] 
  [Text] Washington -- We know that the Americans do not use 
fives and twos but instead grade students with letters of the 
alphabet. The essence is the same, however. The economics 
professors who gathered in Boston from the country's leading 
universities gave President Bill Clinton a solid "B." 
  For his first year of administration, especially in the 
sphere of the economy, the young President gets a "four plus" as 
though there were no minus point. But the positive notes would 
have been even stronger if it had not been for what one 
professor called "the green light for President Yeltsin's 
vacillations." 
  The economics professors call the U.S. Administration's new 
approach to the rate of economic transformations in Russia 
following the parliamentary elections "indulging Yeltsin." Both 
advocates of more confident state intervention in economic 
regulation (the Massachusetts school) and Harvard adherents of 
profound market freedom believe that any delay in switching from 
the state plan to the market will lead only to additional 
difficulties for people, and will still further compromise the 
ideas of democracy. 
  Believing that during his recent visit to Moscow, Vice 
President Al Gore sent the Russian leadership the wrong signal, 
Professor Dornbusch called his visit a "complete and utter 
disaster." 
  But speaking at the same meeting of professors, Lawrence 
Summers, under secretary of the Treasury, denied that the 
administration approves of a "gradual approach" in Russia. He 
simply said that President Yeltsin is having to deal with social 
and economic difficulties whereby privatization and measures to 
switch to the market may be sabotaged by the political 
opposition. 
  However, international notes were muffled at this meeting. 
The domestic economy dominated. 
  "The administration's actions have not only proved 
surprisingly fruitful, they have also been very sensible," R. 
Dornbusch, the famous academic from the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, told the worthy members of the U.S. Economic 
Association. 
  This high assessment by a representative of this institute 
is 
not very surprising. From his first days, Clinton began to look 
to people and ideas from this famous educational establishment. 
The studies of scientists from Massachusetts have been 
reflected in many of the White House's economic measures -- from 
the national program for the retraining of workers to the plan 
for the radical reform of health care. 
  Naturally, with the advent of this administration, the trend 
which held absolute sway in the Reagan-Bush years has been 
squeezed out. This trend is exemplified by the venerable 
Harvard University, many of whose researchers, incidentally, 
came to advise the Russian Government during President George 
Bush's term and are still here. 
  Probably no one objected to the assessment of the 
administration given by Lawrence Klein, the most senior 
professor of economics at Pennsylvania University and a Nobel 
prize winner. He did not intervene in the debate with figures 
and formulas but commented on Clinton's first period as follows: 
"An excellent spring semester." 
  But there were arguments about figures. They mainly 
concerned the permissible unemployment level. And the reduction 
of the defense structure is proceeding by no means painlessly in 
the United States. 
  According to Professor Alan Blinder, the country's economy 
will feel quite comfortable with unemployment at less than 5.5 
percent. However, this level remains only a goal, since in 
November unemployment in the country was at 6.4 percent, and 
critics maintain that the trigger mechanism of inflation starts 
to operate beyond the limit of 6.1 percent unemployment.

  [Text] Berlin, DDP/ADN -- Russian right-wing radical 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has described former Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev as "mad." In an interview with the Berlin 
daily B.Z. (Friday edition), the chairman of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) said of Gorbachev's accusation 
that he (Zhirinovskiy) was a KGB puppet that Gorbachev had "gone 
mad. It's just envy because he has destroyed his own party and 
the Soviet Union." 
  With regard to the refusal to grant him a visa to enter 
Germany, Zhirinovksiy said he did not get a visa "because Gorby 
sold you the GDR." 
  Once again Zhirinovskiy demanded reparations from Germany 
for 
the damage inflicted in Russia during the World War II, referred 
to Soviet war victims, and heavily criticized German reparations 
to Jews. He demanded "an agreement" on Russian property in 
Germany and said that Gorbachev sold East Germany "so cheaply, 
for 14 billion marks," when Chancellor Kohl had offered 140 
billion. Zhirinovskiy said: "We accept this offer." 
  He seeks "good relations" between Russia and Germany, he 
went 
on to say. Twice "our countries have been driven into war." 
This was "wrong," Zhirinovskiy said. "Only we Russians and 
Germans can guarantee stability." 
  With regard to the future of eastern Prussia, Zhirinovskiy 
told Germany: "Solve that with Poland. We don't give a damn 
about it." 
  Concerning his readiness to meet with Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel, Zhirinovksiy referred to wishes for talks expressed by 
Austria, Spain, France, Norway, and Australia and added: "When I 
have some time again then we'll meet." 
  Zhirinovskiy also said he is ready for a meeting with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, but added that in his view Clinton fears 
him and is afraid. Clinton is "exactly the kind of democrat you 
find in our government". Zhirinovskiy went on: "Tell him from 
me: In Russia there is only one party, my LDPR, there are no 
other parties." Boris Yeltsin does not represent the interests 
of Russia, so Clinton had "better meet with us".

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's Liberal 
Democratic Party, said he would seek to become head of an 
international affairs committee in the new parliament, fight for 
the dismissal of Andrey Kozyrev as foreign minister, and replace 
him in that capacity. 
  Talking to journalists in Shchelkovo, a town near Moscow, on 
Thursday [6 January] Zhirinovskiy said, addressing Japanese 
reporters: "You'd better not raise the Kuril Islands issue, 
otherwise we'll bring up the issue of compensation for the 40 
years of the illegal use of Sakhalin by Japan." 
  "We'll drive everyone out of the Sea of Okhotsk -- the 
Japanese, the Koreans, the Filipinos... The Sea of Okhotsk will 
be a closed Russian sea. We'll establish a 200-mile zone, and 
you'll be fishing in Australia," Zhirinovskiy said to the 
Japanese journalists.

that no one can or should interfere in the affairs of the 
Transcaucasus or Central Asia to prevent a new Lebanon. The

planned to occupy the position of Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, and as his first step in the ministerial post intended 
to invite Tokyo to sign a peace treaty. If it refuses 
Zhirinovskiy promises to use the Russian Navy to blockade all

  [Text] Russian-Japanese relations are so far lacking in 
"genuine" trust, Interfax was told Thursday by the new Deputy 
Russian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov, who will be in charge 
of relations with Japan and the countries of Asia and the 
Pacific instead of Georgiy Kunadze, who is now Russian 
Ambassador in Seoul. 
  Panov, who was until recently the Russian Ambassador in 
South 
Korea and for whom the present post was somewhat a surprise, 
sees his main task in promoting confidence in the relationships 
between Russia and Japan. 
  Panov has said that relations with Japan are a key priority 
of the Russian foreign policy determined by Russian President 
Yeltsin. 
  During his last year's visit to Tokyo the two sides fixed 
the 
top priorities of Russian foreign policies towards Tokyo. I do 
not see what is to be changed so much to deviate radically from 
our course, said the diplomat. 
  Speaking about the territorial problem in the Russian- 
Japanese relations, Panov has said that everyone in Russia seems 
to know about its existence. The problem does exist but joint 
forces are needed to search and find the way out, he said.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by political observer Lev Korneshov: "History </F>
Dangerous To Repeat"] 
  [Text] Over the holiday period we were shown "Cabaret," a 
wonderful movie by U.S. director Bob Fosse, on television. Let 
me remind you that the events in it take place in Germany 1931 
during the Nazis' ruthless rise to power. 
  The analogies are too obvious to ignore. But "Cabaret" came 
to the screen in 1972, many years after the end of World War II, 
and now we are being offered instant conclusions that may serve 
as a basis for action in certain circumstances. 
  The first of these conclusions, one which must be 
immediately 
dismissed, is that the situation in "that" Germany and "this" 
Russia is similar: impoverishment, prices, inflation, economic 
recession, etc. But this is only an "outward" resemblance. 
Regrettably, it is on this that many articles and people 
organizing the creation of antifascist committees, "fronts," and 
so forth are focusing their attention. The very idea that the 
Russian people may be infected by the bacilli of fascism, that 
voters who voted for V. Zhirinovskiy and his party are suffering 
from the fascist plague is a blasphemous idea insulting to the 
Russian people, who made countless sacrifices for the sake of 
victory over fascism. 
  There is also a second conclusion: The democratic stratum in 
our society has proved all too thin and barren. During the 
years of the triumphal routing of totalitarianism the small 
number of true democrats has been swelled by a vast number of 
fellow travelers and timeservers, and all together they have 
been unable to take advantage of the unique opportunity that 
they have been given by the people and history. And panic and 
hysteria are now springing up among certain people as a result 
-- owing to the realization that Russia today does not need 
them. Especially since the new constitution does not envisage 
any "eternal" sentinels under democracy -- it is itself the 
guarantor of democracy. 
  In this connection I would like to remind you that the 
coming 
parliamentary battles that some politicians are craving so much 
cannot be of crucial importance for Russian citizens' lives. If 
the Federal Assembly adopts sensible, necessary laws, they will 
be grateful. If not, well, vast sums of the people's money have 
been wasted and people may be called to account.... In any case 
the parliament has its own functions strictly defined by the 
Constitution and those who are trying to overstep them will be 
running a very great risk. That is the third conclusion, with 
which of course by no means everyone agrees. 
  Finally, a word about something that must be discussed, 
picking one's words as carefully as possible. There are just 
two or three men along with the president today (perhaps a few 
more) who are real Russia-wide figures in terms of character, 
erudition, and their understanding of the real problems and ways 
of resolving them. That is lamentable since a commander's 
strength lies in his marshals, and Russia is a burden that one 
man alone cannot bear. 
  I think that the elections were a litmus test measuring not 
verbal effusions of personal devotion but various politicians' 
true significance and clout and their popularity with the 
people. To be blunt, the voters did not see anyone worthy of 
universal trust among those for whom they were asked to vote. 
And had Vasiliy Ivanovich Chapayev suddenly appeared in this 
situation, 99.99 percent of the voters would quite probably have 
voted for him.... 
  It is also bad that the president is running the risk of 
losing such a devoted ally as the mass media, in particular the 
newspapers, not only the big, but also the "small" publications, 
which are simply collapsing under the pressure of Decree No 
1233. Democracy without freedom of speech is an empty shell, 
demagogy. 
  It seems that there are now plenty of people in countries 
near and far from Russia wanting to exploit the uncertain 
situation in our vast country. 
  Today the weather is foul in our country, but I would like 
to 
believe that the storm won't last long. At the end of "Cabaret" 
the main protagonist leaves Germany as it plunges into the 
insanity of nazism -- for him it is a foreign country, he can 
afford the luxury of evading fascist passions. But we Russian 
citizens must not remain on the sidelines when democracy won at 
the price of such hardship and pain is in jeopardy.

  [Text] Andrey Illarionov, leader of the governmental group 
on analysis and planning, declared Thursday that the signing of 
the agreement on unification of Belarus' and Russia's monetary 
systems and formation of a ruble space of these two republics 
"are dangerous and destructive." 
  He said the agreement provides for creation of "two emission 
centers or two central banks with a single currency, the ruble." 
However, as he underlined, it does not provide for efficient 
mechanisms to control emission. 
  Consequently, Illarionov summarized, "there appears an 
opportunity for Belarusian residents to transfer monetary funds, 
bypassing the Central Bank of Russia." "Belarusian residents 
receive an opportunity to compensate their expenditures at the 
expense of the Russian Federation," he added. 
  Illarionov reported that the agreement between Russia and 
Belarus also provides for the creation of a joint fund of gold 
and currency reserves and "it will be a hard burden for Russia 
as it is quite obvious that Belarus has no such reserves." 
  According to Illarionov, creation of such a single monetary 
system could become an additional stimulus for the inflationary 
process in Russia, totaling 10 percent. "At the same time such 
an agreement creates a precedent for other CIS republics to sign 
agreements with Russia on similar conditions," he noted. 
  Illarionov also reported that according to the governmental 
working center of economic reforms, in December inflation was 
10.9 percent (according to the state statistics committee -- 12 
percent) and will remain the same until April 1994. After that 
"there could be a substantial rise in the level of inflation," 
he believes. 
  The working center reports that the industrial production 
level remained stable over the last 5 months but the number of 
unemployed is growing. In December there were already 1.5 Mn 
[million] unemployed in Russia or 1.2 percent of Russia's 
employable population. 
  "Growth in unemployment is the reaction of the Russian 
economy to the toughening of the government's monetary policy," 
said Illarionov.

  [Text] Tajik Prime Minister Abdulmadjid Samadov and Russian 
Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin ended talks in Moscow on Thursday 
by approving a draft agreement on this year's bilateral trade 
and economic cooperation between the two countries. 
  Speaking afterwards, Shokhin said the question of a new 
ruble 
zone was also high on the agenda. The two sides had agreed to 
speed up work by a joint commission on creating a common 
currency system. 
  The commission, due to meet later this month, is expected to 
discuss outstanding issues related to bilateral cooperation, 
Shokhin told reporters. 
  He says Russian experts will draw up measures designed to 
prevent the flight of Russian cash from Tajikistan. "For the 
time being, we are trying to gauge the prospects of creating a 
common ruble zone, but final conclusions will come later," 
Shokhin said.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Glukhov "Observer's Opinion" article: "Afghan </F>
Patience"] 
  [Text] For several days in a row fierce fighting has been 
going on in Kabul. It has also spread to north Afghanistan, to 
the Mazar-e Sharif area, which until now had been considered 
safe. Since 1 January over 100 mojahedin gunmen were killed and 
over 800 were wounded in the Afghan capital as a result of 
rocket and artillery bombardments. Around 4,000 civilians -- 
including women, children, and old people -- have been 
hospitalized with injuries. 
  The new outbreak of violence amounts to a kind of showdown 
between Afghan President B. Rabbani and Prime Minister G. 
Hekmatyar. This time General Dostom appears side by side with 
the latter. The very same "Red general" and commander of Uzbek 
formations who went over from Najibollah's side to that of his 
opponents. It was he who, in that new alliance, forcibly 
blocked the entry of Hekmatyar's troops into Kabul. So 
Hekmatyar hitherto had a score to settle with Dostom. 
  But the alliance of yesterday's enemies and the bloodletting 
between friends (let us recall the fate of Taraki or Amin) is a 
usual phenomenon in Afghan political life. As in a 
kaleidoscope, the pattern of alliance can form from surprising 
combinations. Nevertheless they have their own logic every time. 
  The current outburst of enmity and the new marriage of 
convenience is a reaction to the strengthening of Tajik 
influence in the country's life. Most of Afghanistan's 
population are Pushtuns. Political power has traditionally 
belonged to them. All the Afghan kings have come from Pushtun 
tribes. And of course it was taken for granted that the 
Pushtuns would run affairs in the capital. 
  But what happened? The post of head of state was taken by a 
Tajik. The ambitious Pushtun leader Hekmatyar, head of the 
Islamic Party of Afghanistan, could not even enter Kabul. 
Sessions of the coalition government he heads take place in 
Chahar Asiab, 25 km from the capital. 
  Rabbani is supported by another Tajik -- Shah Mas'ud, the 
regime's "strong man." His clout, authority, and power have 
been accumulated during his years of dogged resistance to 
republic government troops in the Panjshir Valley. It was no 
accident that he became the first defense minister after 
Najibollah's overthrow. 
  Another powerful figure is Ismail Khan, a Tajik. He "rules" 
in Herat, which has become the center of a kind of "Emirate of 
West and South Afghanistan." It comprises six provinces, or 
around 40 percent of the country's territory. They border Iran. 
In his domain Ismail Khan has managed to disarm all other 
opponents and minor detachments. 
  Rabbani's recent trip to Dushanbe was possibly the spark for 
the new outbreak of fighting. It is known that Hekmatyar made 
repeated threats to extend the jihad, the struggle for the 
triumph of Islam, to the Central Asian republics of the former 
Union as well. In that case a normalization of the situation on 
the Afghan-Tajik border, or a strengthening of ties between 
Afghan and former Soviet Tajiks, do not suit him. This 
ultimately leads to the strengthening of Rabbani's positions. 
  Hekmatyar and Dostom are pursuing different aims in the 
alliance against Rabbani. The first's ambitious task is to 
restore the Pushtuns' power in the country's state structures 
and to strengthen personal influence. The second's is to 
preserve the maximum independence from Kabul. At present Dostom 
has control of Afghanistan's six northern provinces with their 
center in Mazar-e Sharif. This area is a symbol of business 
activity. Field commanders who grew rich from the war have 
started acquiring real estate. By ensuring regional stability 
Dustum was able to create a local front uniting various 
political forces, from neocommunists to fundamentalists. What 
suits the "Red general" most is a constantly weakened center. 
  Given the almost complete regional autonomy, instability in 
Afghanistan is becoming a chronic illness. The situation is 
exacerbated by the manifestation not only of national-ethnic but 
also of religious conflicts. Tajiks profess Islam of the Shiite 
persuasion. The Pushtuns are Sunnis. Besides domestic friction 
they have a different foreign policy orientation. The center of 
Shiism is Iran. For Sunnis the highest authority is Saudi 
Arabia. Eternal internecine conflict and the inability to find a 
common language are leading to Afghanistan's self-destruction 
and to the self-destruction of Afghan national groupings. It is 
quite possible that in the near future it will not be they but 
Tehran, Islamabad, and Riyadh playing Afghan patience.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Oliynik report: "Russian `Blue Helmets' in </F>
Yugoslavia Increased. They Will Reinforce the First Russian UN 
Battalion of Peacemaking Forces"] 
  [Text] Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of 
the Airborne Forces, has said in conversation with KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA's correspondent that an additional Russian Army subunit 
is being sent onto Yugoslav territory along with hardware and 
armaments with the knowledge and consent of the UN Security 
Council following a petition from British [as published] Gen. 
Jean Cot, commander of the peacemaking forces in Yugoslavia. It 
is made up of 305 servicemen -- officers, ensigns, sergeants, 
and soldiers serving in the Airborne Forces. This composite 
subunit is equipped with mortars, antitank weapons, and 
antiaircraft weapons. 
  It should be pointed out, Col. Gen. Podkolzin emphasized, 
that this additional contingent is joining the UN peacemaking 
force not to fulfill any separate task on Yugoslav soil but 
merely to reinforce the first Russian infantry battalion of 
"blue helmets," which is presently commanded by Col. Sergey 
Voznesenskiy. As is well known, our battalion has been there 
since April 1992 and is fulfilling a difficult task on the 
so-called demarcation line between opposing forces -- Serbian 
and Croatian -- which passes through the border zone between 
Serbian Krajina and Croatia. It extends for more than 100 km 
along the front and approximately 30 km deep. There are 24 
checkpoints in the zone of responsibility of the battalion, 
which is in the "East" sector. Here the armistice is regularly 
violated, and there is shooting from both the Croatian and the 
Serbian side. Unfortunately, there have been casualties. To 
date two men have died in the battalion, and 19 have received 
injuries of varying degrees of severity. In short, Col. Gen. 
Podkolzin said, it is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfill 
the task in this region with the former forces, and our "blue 
helmets," moreover, only have small arms. This is why the 
decision has been made to reinforce the Russian UN battalion 
with men and combat hardware. Its task is as before -- to bring 
peace to the Balkans....

<F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Vladimir Glod for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk, 6 Jan -- In an exclusive interview with a 
BELINFORM correspondent, Belarus Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Stanislaw Shushkevich confirmed the report distributed by TASS 
channels about his forthcoming meeting with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  The speaker of the Belarusian parliament said the meeting 
will take place next week. During the meeting, the two sides 
will adjust their positions before the forthcoming arrival in 
Moscow and Minsk of U.S. President Bill Clinton and will also 
discuss a wide range of problems of Belarusian-Russian 
relations. Stanislaw Shushkevich said that at the meeting with 
Boris Yeltsin "I will put forward not my own personal point of 
view but the united opinion of the members of the Presidium of 
the Supreme Soviet, who have thoroughly studied the proposals 
put forward by the government and the National Bank of Belarus." 
  Stanislaw Shushkevich said the statement of the heads of 
governments of Belarus and Russia, which was signed yesterday 
but which has not yet been supplemented by the signing of 
documents specifying the mechanism for its implementation, is 
more like a declaration of intent. 
  Concerning Bill Clinton's forthcoming visit to Minsk, the 
head of the Belarusian parliament noted that the talks between 
the Belarusian and U.S. sides "will be conceptual." "If we 
resolve conceptually such problems as disarmament, conversion, 
and the monetary question, then the subsequent signing of the 
relevant documents will be essentially a technical task." 
  Stanislaw Shushkevich said he was very surprised to read in 
the media that Belarusian government head Vyachaslaw Kebich said 
that he "expects Belarus to be able to join NATO after Russia 
joins." The speaker explained that all of Belarus's most 
important documents specify its policy of neutrality and of not 
adhering to any blocs. "We have a totally different foreign 
policy doctrine centered on neutrality," Stanislaw Shushkevich 
said.

  [Text] Grigory Marakutsa, who chairs the parliament of the 
self-proclaimed Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic (TMR), 
welcomed the signing of CIS and economic union documents by 
Moldova in Ashgabat. He told INTERFAX that "these documents 
enable Moldova and Transdniestria to do business with former 
Soviet republics." Marakutsa emphasized that "Transdniestria 
wants Moldova to sign the collective security treaty, which it 
refused to do." 
  In his view, the Transdniestrian conflict cannot be resolved 
unless Moldova, Transdniestria and Gagauzia make a federation or 
confederation within the framework of the former Moldovan SSR. 
"Everybody, notably Ukraine and Russia, wants the existing 
borders of Moldova to be preserved while its internal structure 
is the republic's internal affair," he said. 
  Marakutsa ruled out the possibility of handing over the 
Ilascu group convicted by the Tiraspol court to Moldova. 
  In early December 1993, the TMR Supreme Court sentenced Ilie 
Ilascu, the leader of the Tiraspol branch of the Moldovan 
Christian Democratic Popular Front, to death on charges of 
terrorism while his five comrades were sentenced to different 
prison terms. 
  "In Kishinev, Ilascu and his men are regarded as patriots, 
not terrorists," Marakutsa said. "For this reason we are not 
sure that a new trial will take place there." He said that 
Transdniestria would welcome a retrial by an independent court 
with Russian or Ukrainian judges. 
  Marakutsa denied reports that he pressed for resignation of 
Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army. "We have 
different political views on numerous problems but this does not 
imply that one of us should resign," he said.

Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan-Turkmenistan-Iran-Turkey route. A convoy 
of cars from Kazakhstan will make the first trip along this 
route in February. 
  They also supported a proposal by the Turkish side to invite 
a Turkish-based company to participate in the construction of 
rail cars, and the prime minister suggested that Germany should 
take part in implementing this project. The Turkish minister 
expressed readiness to immediately start addressing some of the 
specific issues. The head of government expressed hope that 
cooperation between the two countries will help the joint 
development of seagoing vessels.

  [Text] We start our program with a report from the Defense 
Ministry press service. 
  Lately Armenia's Armed Forces have been trying to broaden 
their offensive operations in order to occupy more Azerbaijani 
lands. Having brought in a considerable amount of troops and 
military hardware, Armenia's Armed Forces are engaged in a show 
of force in Agdam and Beylagan sectors of the front. The brave 
Azerbaijani fighters are courageously resisting the enemy's 
onslaught, inflicting counter strikes, and forcing him to 
retreat from the occupied lands. Following bloody and fierce 
battles, the Azerbaijani troops repulsed large-scale enemy 
attacks and liberated (Ashagy-Yaglyvent), Kerimbeyly, and 
Shukurbeyly settlements in Fizulinskiy Rayon. At present, our 
troops are in control of Goradiz. The Armenian fighters fleeing 
in panic left behind eight tanks, 12 antitank missiles, six 
missile launchers, seven cannons, three vehicles, and numerous 
other military hardware. 
  Overall, the enemy lost some 500 soldiers, 32 tanks, five 
vehicles, six grenade launchers, and 10 artillery pieces during 
the latest fighting in this sector of the front. More than 
3,000 mines were neutralized. 
  At present the Azerbaijani Army subunits are in control of 
certain regions in Fizulinskiy, Khodzhavend [Martuninskiy], and 
Kelbadzharskiy rayons. Fighting is continuing. 
  The valor of the Azerbaijani fighters is given duly praised 
by the Supreme War Command. Most of the troops and officers 
have been considered worthy of orders and medals. 
  During a reconnaissance operation, Sergeant-Major Ismailov 
Etibar Beyleroglu infiltrated behind the Armenian units and 
displayed bravery in fighting his way in the direction of 
Khodzhavend and inflicting effective blows at the enemy. The 
scouts destroyed six enemy cars, a tent camp, an arms depot, 
three tanks, and some 70 troops. 
  The brave fighter Sergeant-Major Etibar Ismailov, in trying 
to destroy an important Armenian target on 4 January threw the 
grenade he was holding under an enemy tank and saved his 
comrades-in-arm and was martyred heroically. God bless his 
soul, and may his grave be filled with bliss. 
  The Azerbaijani Armed Forces command expressed condolences 
to 
the kin of soldiers martyred during the fighting.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Vladimir Kiryanov: "Capitalists </F>
of Poland, Unite To Trade With the East!"] 
  [Text] Warsaw -- Those were approximately the words with 
which Stanislaw Ciosek, Polish ambassador to Russia, appealed to 
participants in the "Poland and the East" economic forum held 
recently in the city of Krynica. Here there was an exchange of 
opinions among experts, politicians, scientists, and 
entrepreneurs from four neighbor-countries -- Poland, Russia, 
Ukraine, and Belarus. They discussed a "hot" topic: how to 
establish regional economic collaboration. 
  "A very necessary exchange of ideas is taking place at our 
forum, and impulses are being generated which will help 
businesspeople to arrive at real contracts," Yuriy Kashlev, 
Russian ambassador to Poland, told ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's 
correspondent. 
  It is hard not to agree that there is a great need for ideas 
and powerful impulses at the present transitional stage. As S. 
Ciosek noted, Poland and its eastern neighbors at present have 
very little chance of competing with giant international 
capital. In his opinion, the central-eastern and eastern 
countries should pool their efforts and create major economic 
structures. Something else is also important. "The governments 
must adopt a clear stance," S. Ciosek said. "We all have 
similar conditions for the creation of mechanisms to facilitate 
an advantageous exchange of goods and services. But the 
mechanisms do not yet exist. Unfortunately, bureaucrats in both 
countries -- Poland and Russia -- are too accustomed to mere 
talk, to slogans and assurances, to consensus that is merely 
verbal." 
  The state should also help to create the necessary 
international accounting centers and think about guarantees for 
businessmen, the creation of insurance companies -- everything 
that, in the West, makes it possible to avoid risk in trade. 
There is a lot of talk about this too, but everything stays the 
same. "I think the Russians do not really know what they could 
buy from us," S. Ciosek lamented. "They think of Poland in 
terms of apples and potatoes. So they go to other countries to 
look for technology..." 
  Of course, it is no bad thing that the Poles have learned to 
sell us potatoes and apples. But Poland has already been 
invited to participate in joint conversion projects with Russia 
in the aviation industry, transportation, and other sectors, 
projects which will have their application in the 21st century. 
Poland, for its part, could offer the Russians some of its own 
technologies for joint development. 
  And here is the opinion of Polish Marshal Jozef Oleksy, who 
agrees: 
  "In central-eastern Europe and Russia," he said, "in the 
course of changing the former systems, people have been strongly 
attracted to a model of development based on unilateral 
cooperation and integration in a Western direction. The time 
has now come to reflect on this phenomenon. Whichever way you 
look at it, it must be admitted that no system of aid from the 
West -- which is selfish and does not always have a full picture 
of the extent of real changes in the East, and furthermore has 
its own recession and economic difficulties -- can resolve 
problems relating to changes in the economic structures and the 
economic development of Russia, Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus. 
This means that, while maintaining close links with the world 
economic system, it is necessary at the same time to seek a 
basis for change in our own potential and in the development of 
economic collaboration within the region." 
  It is first and foremost a question of government 
regulation, government guarantees and insurance for firms, and 
the formulation of customs and taxation agreements. Only then 
will private and state firms active in the international market 
be able to operate efficiently.... 
  Yevgeniy Rogovskiy, Russia's trade representative in Poland, 
noted that support from the governments for the entrepreneurial 
activity which we would like to initiate must take the form, 
first and foremost, of the creation of permanent information 
systems which report to one another not on trivia, but on major 
areas of internal demand. 
  He gave an illustration. It is well known in Russia that 
Poland has decided radically to modify its petroleum-refining 
industry. It is very much hoped that it will bear in mind the 
enormous potential available in Russia and other countries. 
Concrete interests could emerge in other sectors too -- 
electronics, chemicals. 
  Zbigniew Czezadlo, who works for the well-known Polish 
brewery "Zywiec" and brought the product to the "Mining Lands 
Fair," noted that at the moment business with the Eastern 
neighbors is proceeding with difficulty. If you manage to sell 
anything, it is exclusively on a barter basis. Last time, beer 
was exchanged for Russian salt. He was very surprised to learn 
that Russian enterprises have the right to pay for goods in hard 
currency and to transfer that currency to the foreign producers' 
accounts. 
  This may be an isolated case. But it shows how little 
businessmen operating on different sides of the border still 
know about their neighbors' economic potential, not to mention 
their laws. Polish entrepreneurs now want to bring together all 
the structures scattered across the country which are concerned 
with the East, and to create a Polish business center in Moscow. 
Its staffers, working on commercial terms, would take the place 
of uninterested state officials. There are a great many other 
ideas, such as the plan to develop the Eastern Institute, which 
is already preparing a program for a grants foundation to help 
students and scientists from the former USSR.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Karpov report: "Christmas-Tide Fortune-Telling. </F>
Kiev Clearly Wants To Join the List of European Capitals Waiting 
for Clinton"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the Russian capital, a 
number of agreements, including documents on the 
nonproliferation of nuclear arms, are scheduled to be signed on 
14 January. Whether it will be the presidents of three or two 
states who will affix their signatures to the documents, 
however, is anybody's guess. Still, according to THE WASHINGTON 
POST, "the United States, Russia, and Ukraine have stepped up 
talks on dismantling Ukraine's nuclear potential in the hope of 
signing a corresponding agreement in Moscow next week." 
Intensive negotiations are under way in the U.S. capital 
attended, aside from Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy 
Mamedov, by his Ukrainian counterpart, Valeriy Shmarov. 
  Still, it seems unlikely that Leonid Kravchuk will arrive in 
Moscow. Giving up nuclear missiles together with going hat in 
hand to big brother would have become too good a trump card in 
the hands of his domestic opponents, who would not miss an 
opportunity to accuse the Ukrainian president of a lack of 
"genuinely national thinking." Nonetheless, squandering a 
chance to give himself a 60th birthday present of meeting with 
the U.S. President would be unforgivable from a purely human 
point of view. This is why reports that Kravchuk invited 
Clinton to pay a visit to Kiev -- although, to all appearances, 
the American side seems to be thinking that a trip to the U.S. 
capital was quite enough for the Ukrainian president -- are 
hardly credible. 
  It is well known that by giving up Belarus' nuclear 
potential, Shushkevich earned warm thanks from the U.S. leader, 
consequently Minsk has firmly reserved a slot on the itinerary 
of Clinton's European tour. At the same time, being the CIS' 
head office, it may just as well offer to play host to a summit 
of the U.S. and Ukrainian Presidents. All the more so, because 
in this event the meeting will be devoid of the "Moskal" 
[derogatory Ukrainian word for "Russian"] accent. [passage 
omitted]

been inaccessible so far. Recently in Ukraine, the first 
Ukrainian-German joint venture UNA has been established in this 
area. Among its founders were the Rivne nuclear power plant, 
the Kiev Institute Enerhoproekt, and the German joint stock 
company KAB. 
  German nuclear power engineers have great experience in 
constructing nuclear power stations and improving their 
security. The new joint venture company will reinforce hermetic 
containers of the first and second power units at the Rivne 
nuclear power plant. Experts have recommended installation of a 
pass for polluted metal in a special smelting furnace. Also 
preliminary inspection of containers has already been conducted.

  [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent learned from reliable 
sources on 6 January that an agreement determining Ukraine's 
debt to Kazakhstan and transferring this debt to the state 
account was made ready for Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's arrival in Ukraine, which according to preliminary 
information is planned for mid-January. Ukraine will have to 
have 1.2 million U.S. dollars repaid by 1999. The Ukrainian 
side has not yet defined its position on determining either the 
debt of Kazakhstan to Ukraine or those of Russia and other CIS 
countries, although there have already been cases of debts made 
over to be repaid by the state, in particular in mutual 
relations with Russia.

  [Text] A meeting between Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko, and 
the editors in chief of Russian periodicals and the heads of 
newspaper unions has begun at the Russian Government House on 
Krasnpresnenskaya Naberezhnaya. This is the first meeting the 
head of the Russian cabinet has had with such a representative 
group of journalists since he became prime minister a year ago. 
  The meeting may untie the complex knot of problems which has 
risen since the government's 25 November decision to reassess 
the basic assets of national economy enterprises. Media chiefs 
believe that the increase in the value of the basic assets of 
printing enterprises will lead to a six-fold increase in the 
cost of typographical services. The critical situation which 
has emerged has thus far all but led, like all journalists' 
protests, to a suspension of the publication of a number of 
publications from 10 January. 
  Opening the meeting, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed that the 
Russian Government is looking closely at the journalists' 
problems, but he expressed the opinion that the journalists, who 
from the outset have favored market reform, have today become 
fully integrated into market conditions.

  [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan -- Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
said today he will introduce a special procedure for operating 
the 25 November government decision on revaluing the basic funds 
of national economy enterprises with respect to the printing and 
paper-making industries and communications. He made this 
decision as a result of his meeting today in the House of the 
Russian Federation Government with the editors in chief of 
Russian publications and the heads of journalists' unions. 
  At the same meeting, the editors in chief promised not to 
hold the protest action -- halting the output of a number of 
publications -- planned for 10 January. 
  The 25 November government decision on reassessing among 
other things the value of the basic funds of printing 
enterprises could have led to a six-fold rise in the cost of 
printing services. The journalists of a number of publications 
threatened to strike in protest against this.

"Why Milk Goes Sour Quickly in Russia"] 
  [Text] A new list of duties on imported goods is being 
discussed extensively in various ministries in Moscow. 
  Duties on imported goods may serve several purposes. First 
of all, there is basic protectionism, that is, the protection of 
domestic manufacturers against competition from foreign 
companies. Second, the fiscal aim, or the strengthening of the 
income part of the state budget. Third, by regulating the flow 
of commodities into the country, you can strengthen its balance 
of payments and the national currency rate. Some people in 
Russia believe that high tariffs can be used to protect 
consumers' interests within the country. 
  First of all, something about protectionism. The main rule 
is that you cannot simultaneously protect all sectors by means 
of tariffs (this can be achieved only by completely closing the 
borders, with entirely predictable consequences). You can only 
protect individual, relatively small industries. Let us suppose 
that a decision is adopted to raise tariffs on the import of 
automobiles, automobile spare parts, and machine tools. Does 
the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant gain something? Can it 
successfully compete even on the domestic market against 
imported output? The answer is by no means obvious. The price 
of imported automobiles will go up to some extent. This will be 
followed by the price of domestic automobiles, but the plant's 
profit as a whole may fall because of the simultaneous increase 
in the cost of production connected with the acquisition of more 
expensive equipment and spare parts. You can draw one 
conclusion from this simple example: Which of the enterprises 
are protected is unknown, but on the other hand, it is clear who 
has lost -- all the country's automobile manufacturers. 
  The introduction of duties on machines and equipment may 
have 
even more serious consequences (particularly loud appeals are 
being made by lobbyists to introduce such duties). A high 
tariff will be an obstacle to importing state-of-the-art 
equipment, and Russian manufacturers will be forced to use old 
and obsolescent machines. This will make all potential exporters 
uncompetitive, because they will be working with old equipment. 
  The second rule is that, if raised duties of a protectionist 
nature are implemented, then this should only be on consumer 
goods. 
  Now something about the fiscal role of duties on imports. 
Despite popular opinion, the overwhelming majority of budget 
income from this type of tax depends not only on the rate of the 
tax itself but also on how easy it is to collect. Furthermore, 
importers seek and often find a possibility of completely 
avoiding or significantly reducing payments. The idea of 
re-grading, as old as the whole command system itself, is in 
operation here: One commodity is imported, but another is 
declared, and it is not the state treasury that gains, but 
individual interested parties. 
  Hopes that higher import tariffs may have a favorable effect 
on the balance of payments and the rate of exchange are also 
illusory. In theory, the demand for foreign currency will most 
likely fall, which may help maintain a stable exchange rate. 
But stabilizing the exchange rate by reducing imports is using 
the worst of all the possible methods. First of all, an 
increase in exports could have a far more significant favorable 
effect on the exchange rate and its stabilization (the abolition 
of export quotas in 1994 would make it possible to increase 
exports by $18 billion). And second, successful macroeconomic 
stabilization would ensure a stable rate of exchange in the long 
term. But after all, the exchange rate is not an end in itself. 
And although the historical experience of countries which have 
suffered high inflation and hyperinflation shows graphically 
that the stabilization of the currency rate was always a 
constituent element of a successful policy of curbing inflation, 
the experience of summer 1993 testifies that the stability of 
the ruble against the dollar has not led to a reduction in 
internal inflation or an improvement in any other macroeconomic 
indicators. 
  In conclusion, the thesis about the protection of the 
Russian consumers' interests. You have to start with the fact 
that the actual approach is wrong in principle. The rights of 
the consumer may best be protected by a system of no import 
duties. 
  In 1990 the Polish peasants, who are a powerful and 
well-organized force in the country, demanded that the 
government maintain high duties on the import of milk and dairy 
products. More or less in the same way as Russian manufacturers 
are now complaining that Russia will suffer from lower tariffs, 
they stated that the unrestricted import of milk into Poland 
would lead to a significant reduction in agricultural production 
and increase unemployment. The reformers' government stood firm 
and refused to compromise. The beginning of open competition 
against foreign milk was a really difficult time for the Polish 
farmers, as Polish milk was literally going sour after a few 
days, whereas European milk could keep for far longer. But in 
the end they were able to significantly improve the quality and 
saleability of the product, and they were victorious. West 
Europe is now being forced to protect itself against Polish 
dairy expansion. It is obvious who was the winner in this story 
-- the Polish consumers, who received good-quality milk, and the 
Polish producers, trading with Europe. 
  Russia differs from Poland in that here it is not only the 
peasants who are well organized. Russia has the most effective 
system in the world for lobbying decisions being adopted by the 
government. Enterprises relate to industrial ministries, and 
their interests are protected in the government by the 
ministers. Only the poor consumer is left unprotected. If the 
government is led by the industrial ministries and raises the 
rates on imported output, the Russian consumer will continue to 
drive automobiles which are eternally lagging behind Western 
models, work using outdated equipment, and drink sour milk.

  [Text] Moscow is waiting for the visit of President Bill 
Clinton, who is to arrive here on Wednesday. The media say the 
program of the meeting between the American head of state and 
President Boris Yeltsin has been agreed upon on all key matters. 
It will be a continuation of the summit that took place last 
April in Vancouver, Canada. 
  According to the press service of the Russian president, the 
Moscow meeting will continue the search for ways of expanding 
partnership, in particular cooperation in the light of the 
strategy of reform carried out in Russia. The agenda also 
includes key international problems, such as the strengthening 
of security and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
peace-making operations in regional conflicts. The talks should 
cover the entire spectrum of questions of bilateral relations 
too. 
  The Moscow summit should become a major international event, 
like the meeting in Vancouver and other top-level talks between 
the two great powers. This can be explained by the role that 
Russian- American relations play in the world community. 
  Still, one can say that the coming summit talks will have 
their own identity. They are going to take place in conditions 
of the further advancement of reforms in Russia. The reforms 
were in the centre of attention during the parliamentary 
elections in Russia last month. The pros and cons of the 
reforms became evident then. The election results influenced the 
domestic political scene in Russia and to a certain extent 
international relations too. A somewhat new situation emerged 
and new questions appeared, some of which are linked to 
Russian-American relations. 
  Vladislav Kozyakov comments on the distinctive features of 
the upcoming Moscow meeting. He writes: 
  If you review the road between Vancouver and Moscow, that is 
between last April and January, you will notice quite a few 
achievements. Russia and the United States have come closer to 
each other. Much of what was agreed on in Vancouver has been 
done. Here one could name the decision of the United States 
Congress to earmark means for support to Russia and several 
concrete aid programs. What is more important, scores of 
agreements in economy have been concluded. Russia will take 
part in the construction of an international space station 
together with the United States, while America will be involved 
in the modernization of the Russian oil industry. These and 
other programs should benefit both nations. 
  But now new tasks have come to the fore, primarily 
cooperation directed at encouraging democratic changes in 
Russia. The parliamentary elections in Russia clearly showed 
that the reforms, the way they were carried out so far, were too 
harsh for the broad masses. At a recent news conference 
President Yeltsin spoke of the need for additional social 
measures. The Russian reformers are determined to somewhat 
amend their own strategy and take steps to raise living 
standards. It is indicative that Western capitals arrived at a 
similar conclusion. Declarations were made there in support of 
broader efforts to back social programs in Russia. President 
Clinton even spoke for doubling the efforts of Western countries 
in this sphere. One can foresee that this aspect of 
Russian-American partnership is going to be discussed in detail 
at the Moscow summit. 
  However, certain aspects of relations between Moscow and 
Washington should be altered in the current situation. The time 
that has passed since Vancouver has demonstrated the great 
potential of the establishment of fully normalized, equal 
relations in trade. However, even now, far from all the 
restrictions introduced by the United States during the cold war 
have gone down in history. Unfortunately, in some other spheres 
one can also notice that the West does not fully realize the 
true needs and lawful interests of Russian reformers, conducting 
democratic changes in such a mammoth country. Washington and 
other Western capitals, as well as international financial 
organizations, are trying to measure the progress of Russian 
reforms, their scale and speed, according to their own pattern 
and accordingly determine their attitudes to actual programmes 
of economic cooperation. Meanwhile, such an approach is 
absolutely unacceptable in relations with a great power. 
  There are also some other areas in which the west should 
stop 
being didactical in its dialogue with Moscow, to use the 
expression of the Russian foreign minister, Andrey Kozyrev. 
Russia expects the coming summit in Moscow to be productive and 
be marked by new understanding, greater partnership in all 
spheres of cooperation.

"Visiting Boris -- Via `Borispol'? The U.S. President Has Quite 
a Lot of Things To Do in Europe -- Beginning With Deciding 
Whether To Open the Doors to NATO Membership for All Who Want To 
Enter and Ending With an Impromptu Meeting With the Ukrainian 
President"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- The special booklet carefully produced in 
Washington for those members of the U.S. press bound for the 
summit meeting in Moscow points out that Russia is a cold 
country where survival in winter is hard and where furthermore 
crime is to be feared and rides in "private taxis" are to be 
avoided. Among the plus points it lists "the likelihood of 
moderate prices for souvenirs if you pay in dollars." I would 
dispute that point: Prices in Moscow today, both in general and 
in particular, have outstripped those in America, despite the 
fact that the country is falling apart before our very eyes. 
  The present meeting between the two leaders is a jubilee 
one, 
the 25th since Khrushchev's time. But in terms of meetings 
between Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, it is the second and is 
surely once more akin to a "leap into the unknown." In 
Vancouver their discussion took place on the eve of the April 
referendum after a week of feverish thought in Washington about 
whether there was any point in meeting "on the eve of 
uncertainty." The situation is also quite tricky after the 
December elections in Russia. I am bound to agree with Brent 
Scowcroft, Bush's former national security adviser, who remarked 
that if this visit had not been planned long ago Clinton would 
surely not now have wanted to make the trip but would have 
waited for the dust to settle and for relations between Yeltsin 
and Zhirinovskiy to become clear. As for Vladimir Volfovich, 
the U.S. President has already decided not to meet with him for 
the moment, although during the visit he may demonstrate his 
sympathies for reformers not only of the pro-Yeltsin type. 
  Meanwhile during the visit the U.S. President will clearly 
have to try to convince his own fellow countrymen that, even if 
America does not have a clear concept of its relations with 
Russia today, it is at least working on one. That criticism has 
been expressed increasingly loudly lately, along with barbs 
aimed at the secretary of state, who is increasingly loudly 
being called "sluggish" and "irresolute" in the United States. 
Meanwhile the accusations that the U.S. Administration's course 
is unclear are being countered by the thesis that it is not only 
America but also international financial institutions which 
should respond more clearly and promptly to the social reforms 
in Russia -- in the sense of providing Western aid. On the 
subject of Western aid, Russia has so far not received even the 
amount that it was promised. For example, the $5.5 billion 
which the IMF proposed giving us is still in doubt. Since 1992 
Russia has received $2.5 billion. The rest will be paid only if 
the IMF considers that we will fulfill the agreed conditions. 
  Clinton's team believes that this is right, while at the IMF 
the rate of inflation and the imbalance in the money system are 
giving rise to definite doubts. In this connection two IMF 
missions will come to Russia to work in January. If they 
believe that the government does have concrete and durable 
remedies for stabilizing the economy they will "release" a 
further $1.5 billion to us and will make recommendations on 
social aid to citizens who have suffered during the economic 
reforms. 
  According to information in BUSINESS WEEK, the U.S. 
President is considering offering his Russian counterpart a 
further $1 billion for items of expenditure in the new budget in 
1994. He will also focus attention on the theme of creating a 
social safety net in Russia -- I do not rule out the possibility 
of technical assistance in elaborating it -- relating to a 
system of unemployment benefits, food subsidies, and so forth. 
  During the visit there will probably be an announcement of a 
joint Russian-U.S. project aimed at prospecting and opening up 
oil fields in West Siberia and on Sakhalin. U.S. oil and gas 
companies are planning to set aside $3.4 billion for this 
purpose -- meanwhile U.S. investments in Russia stand at $400 
million today. 
  I would recall here that the two presidents will also give 
their formal blessing to a whole series of agreements concluded 
in Moscow during U.S. Vice President Gore's visit -- agreements 
on space, on ensuring the safety of nuclear reactors, and on new 
norms for foreign investments. 
  The U.S. President will spend four hours in Minsk -- as a 
mark of gratitude for Belarus' constructive stance on the 
question of scrapping nuclear missiles. As for a meeting with 
the Ukrainian leader, after rumors that Clinton had invited him 
to Moscow earlier than Yeltsin a statement was made on an 
agreement to hold a meeting of the three presidents in Moscow. 
On 12 December the U.S. visitor will probably stop off at 
[Kiev's] "Borispol" airport. 
  The U.S. first lady and her daughter will join the President 
on Friday after spending a few days in Europe. 
  Here is one more fact: Several days ago, before New Year, 
the U.S. President visited his native state of Arkansas and with 
a laugh showed the whole country the "family" shorts given to 
him for his morning jog by the people of his state. Last 
Thursday Bill Clinton had to return to his home state, 
unfortunately for a very solemn occasion -- in connection with 
the death of his mother. But one of the drawbacks to the 
President's work is that even personal tragedies do not cause 
state visits to be canceled.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas believes 
that Lithuania's decision to join NATO should not change the 
relations established with Russia and other neighboring states. 
  Brazauskas declared this to the Russian service of 
Lithuanian 
national radio, which he visited on Thursday together with Prime 
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius. 
  Brazauskas underlined that this political move should not be 
viewed as an intention "to change or to toughen relations with 
Russia and other states." In his words, leaders of all European 
countries should have reached an agreement on creation of "a 
single security umbrella." 
  Slezevicius added that "Lithuania's orientation towards the 
West does not represent any innovation in our foreign policy" 
and integration into the European security system, such as NATO, 
"would be a premise for stabilizing the situation in the 
region, and this is important both for Lithuania and all 
neighboring states."

  [Text] A Russian Foreign Ministry official believes that 
"the haste" with which Lithuania's President Algirdas Brazauskas 
has formally applied for NATO membership "looks odd and 
counterproductive." 
  Briefing newsmen in Moscow on Thursday, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Grigoriy Karasin suggested that this step reflected 
the sentiments of "certain political forces which regard 
alignment with military and political unions as the key to 
national security." 
  He called "for giving more thought to what is of prime 
importance for guaranteed stability in Europe." 
  Moscow, in his words, favors "a genuinely European security 
system for all states, collective actions to meet any challenge 
today, and efforts to boost the CSCE potential." 
  "Equal security for each and everyone and cooperation rather 
than new dividing lines between states - that's what Europe 
requires today," Karasin declared. 
  In his words, such an approach prevails in CSCE, in the 
North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council, and in NATO itself. No wonder, 
the concept "Partnership for Peace" has been devised to 
strengthen security across Europe rather than within blocs. The 
concept has drawn much response.

  [Text] Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, 
who returned from Washington to Kiev Saturday, believes that 
"one should not be in a hurry to make any conclusions" 
concerning statements of the American officials on impossibility 
to expand relations with Ukraine until the nuclear weapons 
problem is solved. "One should wait," he declared to Ukrainian 
journalists in the airport. 
  At the same time the deputy minister deviated from any 
comments regarding results of the Ukrainian-American 
negotiations held by the Ukrainian governmental delegation this 
week. 
  Ukraine's Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov, head of the 
delegation, is still in the United State and will return to Kiev 
on Monday. Ukrainian officials are expected to voice their 
statement on the result of the negotiations the same day. 
  Meanwhile, the official press release distributed by the 
Ukrainian Embassy to the United States says that "during the 
consultations held by the Ukrainian delegation in the US State 
Department the parties focused their attention on economic 
development of two countries." 
  The document says that in the course of a meeting between 
members of the delegation with the US President Bill Clinton 
"the parties have discussed a wide spectrum of issues related to 
bilateral relations between Ukraine and United States and, in 
particular, prospects of expansion of economic relations between 
two states, military-political problems, and international 
security issues." 
  The negotiations paid special attention to the discussion of 
a program of negotiations of the Ukrainian governmental 
delegation which is scheduled to visit the United States late 
January. 
  In Pentagon the parties signed a statement on principles 
related to the creation of an American-Ukrainian committee on 
defense industry conversion. 
  The press release contains no information on tripartite 
Russian-Ukrainian-American consultations on nuclear disarmament.

  [Text] Odessa January 10 TASS - "We are studying now" the 
question of a place and time for a possible meeting between 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, Viktor Stelmakh, head of the press service of the 
Ukrainian president and the government said in a telephone 
interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday at 10:45, Moscow time [0745 
GMT]. 
  This is the only response by Ukraine for the time being to 
an 
issue which is of interest to many other capitals, apart from 
Kiev. 
  However, nobody doubts Ukraine's interest in such a meeting. 
Describing numerous possible versions, local analysts prefer 
three most probable: the first suggests that a meeting may take 
place at the Kiev Airport on January 12 if Clinton makes a 
stopover en route from Prague to Moscow. 
  According to the second version, the Ukrainian president 
will 
visit Moscow on January 14. The third presupposes the two 
presidents' meeting in Minsk on Sunday, January 16. 
  Kiev very painfully reacts to another inaccuracy circulated 
by various mass media, including Russian, concerning the number 
of missiles in Ukraine. Some periodicals wrote about 1,000 
nuclear missiles. 
  In actual fact, this is an error made as a result of 
confusing nuclear warheads with missiles. Ukraine has 176 
strategic nuclear missiles. Kiev believes that it is to destroy 
130 of them in compliance with the START-1 treaty.

  [Text] The head of one of the commissions of the Ukrainian 
parliament has accused the United States of putting pressure on 
Ukraine to make it speed up its nuclear disarmament. 
  Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary Commission 
on 
International Affairs, said such pressure, which came from 
Russia and the United States, could only give a better chance to 
radicals at the March 1994 parliamentary election. 
  "If we're talked to from a position of strength, the only 
result will be that we'll want to defend ourselves," he told 
reporters in Kiev. Ukraine is a sovereign state, "and we won't 
go on our knees before anyone, not even before the president of 
America," he said, commenting on a statement by a White House 
spokesman, who said on January 5 that U.S.-Ukrainian relations 
would remain at their present low level until Ukraine met all 
its nuclear disarmament commitments. 
  Pavlychko said the United States was mainly interested in 
Russia, with which Ukraine would, however, find "common 
language." "We have lived together and will continue to live 
together," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Martsynovskyy: "Missiles on Target. </F>
Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons Are Among the Main Objectives in 
Moscow's Offensive External Policy" 
  [Text] It would be naive to believe that our missiles 
constitute a military threat for Russia. These missiles are 
under the operational control of Russia's Strategic Missile 
Troops headquarters; they are serviced by Russian specialists 
alongside Ukrainian ones; our military doctrine does not 
envisage first nuclear strike, and so forth. Notwithstanding 
this, Russia seeks Ukraine's nuclear disarmament as soon as 
possible and the "missiles issue" remains a stumbling-block in 
relations between Ukraine and Russia. 
  Moscow is developing vigorous activity. Taking advantage of 
its prestige (more specifically, our lack of prestige) in the 
world, it does everything it can to continue playing the role of 
a big brother who holds the younger brother's hand and keeps 
pointing at him: "A naughty boy!" This negative image of 
Ukraine, the image of a minor nuclear aggressor is also steadily 
being created by the Russian mass media, which are readily 
quoted by the West. The world community is being encouraged to 
put pressure upon Ukraine. An appeal was recently issued by 
Russian designers, scientists, and specialists of the Atomic 
Energy Ministry [Minatom] to citizens and governments of world 
states, in which the Russians intimidated those governments with 
the dangerous state of Ukrainian nuclear warheads. All the 
numerous statements by high-ranking Ukrainian politicians and 
military figures on the groundlessness of such assertions do not 
produce any special effect and constitute, figuratively 
speaking, whispers against a background of Russian loudspeakers. 
  Russia's official argument in this political struggle is the 
dangerous state of our missiles. Having pointed out that our 
politicians (people's deputy Serhiy Semenets, co-chairman of the 
group for studying aspects of ratifying START I: "Emergency 
Situations Are Impossible") and military figures (Minister of 
Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy: "The State of Missile Facilities Is 
Satisfactory") have a different opinion, we will proceed to some 
other, more spontaneous, methods resorted to by Moscow for 
attaining Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. 
  If Ukraine gets rid of its missiles, Russia will become the 
only nuclear power in the region of Central and Eastern Europe. 
This will also give it the traditional and desired possibility 
to be at the top. The Russian desire to be in control is more 
than obvious: For example, Russia's nervous reaction to plans by 
Poland, Hungary, and Czechia to join NATO was very revealing. 
If such plans are implemented, the alignment of forces promoted 
in the region will not be in Russia's best interests. At a 
recent (1 December 1993) CSCE conference in Rome, Russia 
demanded that the mandate of a peacekeeper in CIS countries be 
given to it -- not a single country supported that initiative. 
Fortunately for us, because that mandate, alongside statements 
by Russian politicians, in particular, Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Andrey Kozyrev ("Russia must actively defend the rights 
of the Russian-speaking population, using rapid-deployment 
forces for the purpose"), would give our neighbors an 
opportunity for large-scale activities, since (again, from 
Moscow's point of view) that "Russian-speaking population" is 
abused in almost every former Union republic. Thus, Russia is 
clearly striving to gain control of the region, and Ukrainian 
missiles, which are presently a real factor of deterrence, do 
not in any way suit its "far-reaching" plans. 
  Another factor of Russian impatience is totally prosaic -- 
the cost of the content of the Ukrainian warheads. This amounts 
to billions of U.S. dollars. That is why Russia demands that 
the warheads be transferred precisely to it. Kazakhstan, which 
had hitherto been "quiet," played a dirty trick on Moscow: On 
13 December, an American-Kazakhstan agreement was signed -- the 
Americans want to buy the entire uranium content of Kazakhstan's 
missiles. That uranium is worth about $1 billion; therefore, 
this money is flowing under Russia's nose into Kazakhstan's 
treasury. Moscow newspapers immediately called Kazakhstan's 
missiles "in fact, Russian property" and regretted that 
Ukraine's uncompromising position is having such a bad influence 
upon Kazakhstan's behavior. Therefore, Russia's striving to get 
hold of Ukrainian warheads is perfectly understandable, as is 
also Moscow's anxiety on this point: There is no agreement 
between Ukraine and Russia on transferring warheads to Russian 
plants. 
  Russia's reaction to our parliament's decree on ratifying 
START-1 was all the more negative. At that time, Moscow 
resembled a furious fisherman looking at yet another empty hook. 
Kozyrev demonstratively refused to receive our Ambassador 
Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy. The aforementioned appeal by Russian 
scientists to the world was quickly arranged. The Moscow press, 
having stopped pouring dirt by buckets, opened all the taps on 
the tank. 
  A few words on the decree itself. It is quite obvious that 
this document cannot be assessed in a simple way. Yes, despite 
previous promises, we have actually become a nuclear power, 
although temporarily so; yes, the decree is at variance with 
some articles of the Lisbon Protocol under which our president's 
signature appears; yes, the document itself, from the point of 
view of politicians, contains rather naive points regarding 
security guarantees for Ukraine. However, it is pointless to 
assert either the wisdom or worthlessness of that document, 
proceeding from immediate considerations alone: Doubtless the 
future, perhaps, not so distant, will provide such an 
assessment. Let me remind you that the deputies almost 
unanimously (what a surprise!) approved the reduction, over 
seven years, of 36 percent of launch vehicles and 42 percent of 
warheads. They [the deputies] advanced conditions to the world: 
Never use nuclear weapons against Ukraine; do not use 
conventional armed forces against it, and do not resort to the 
threat of force; refrain from exerting economic pressure for the 
purpose of resolving any disputes; respect Ukraine's territorial 
integrity and inviolability of borders. By the time the decree 
was adopted, Ukraine had 176 vertical-launch installations with 
1,240 nuclear warheads and 43 heavy bombers with 372 nuclear 
warheads. 
  That the position of the Ukrainian parliament should not be 
characterized in categorically negative terms was soon confirmed 
by the Russian elections in which Zhirinovskiy, a "sincere 
friend" of the former imperial colonies, triumphed. 
Anti-Ukrainian articles on nuclear topics immediately 
disappeared from Moscow newspapers (apparently, not for long). 
The world became concerned and a question arose: Is it 
generally safe to transfer the Union's nuclear weapons to 
Russia? At any rate, the warheads of 17 missiles that were 
deactivated by Ukraine at the end of December have remained "at 
home." At other times, this would have given rise to certain 
emotions in Russia. Now, there is complete tranquility. Maybe, 
the United States will also revise its policy with regard to 
Ukraine. So far, it only listened to what Russia was saying. 
  According to Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine will continue to 
adhere 
to its decision to become a nuclear-free state, but we will 
demand that a tripartite agreement be concluded with Russia and 
the United States. Meanwhile, an opinion is being formed among 
Ukrainian parliamentarians on the need for Ukraine to gain full 
control of its missiles: Such control on the part of Russia is 
dangerous for our country. It is significant that there is no 
nonaggression agreement between the two states. Besides, 
Russia's military doctrine envisages a preventive nuclear strike 
against nuclear countries. Technically speaking, according to 
specialists, it is not a major problem for Ukraine to gain 
positive control over the missiles. The problem is, rather, a 
political one. 
  Without doubt, we are in favor of a nuclear-free world. 
However, at present, a number of political and economic 
considerations prompt us to refrain from hasty steps, such as 
was the proclamation of the country's nuclear-free status at the 
dawn of our independence. At any rate, the fulfillment of the 
parliament's decree has already started, and this is a specific 
step toward a nuclear-free Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy by </F>
Georgiy Chernomorskiy; place and date not given: "I Will Not 
Accept Reproach Regarding Ashgabat"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Chernomorskiy] There have 
been reports in the press regarding your speech at the session 
of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council in Ashgabat, blaming you 
for making statements contradicting our official state policy. 
Is that correct? 
  [Radetskyy] I believe that some lies have been added to the 
truth. Tell me, what was wrong with Ukraine's desire to share 
its experience of forming national armed forces with other 
states, given the fact that our Republic was the first to set 
out upon that path? Or what harm could be done by my statement 
regarding building our relations on a bilateral basis? This 
would be the most acceptable solution for us. Besides, I do not 
rule out the possibility of resolving several problems within 
the CIS framework. Some politicians have attempted to reproach 
me. Thus, I would ask you to publish the text of my Ashgabat 
speech in your newspaper. [passage omitted] 
  [Chernomorskiy] Television reports have repeatedly 
emphasized that a number of important issues were resolved in 
the course of your meeting with Russian Defense Minister 
Grachev, and that there was no confrontation between you two. 
What did you discuss? 
  [Radetskyy] I used to study with Pavel Grachev at the 
General Staff Academy, where he was in his senior year. When I 
met him in Ashgabat I was afraid that the "elder brother 
syndrome" might have an impact on our relations. However, 
Grachev was very polite, both to me and my motherland. That 
determined the atmosphere of the negotiations. We discussed 
military-technical issues. If Russia does not receive Ukrainian 
subassemblies it will not be able to produce certain arms. At 
the same time, Ukrainian defense industries will face work 
stoppages without Russian parts. We also reached an agreement 
on another important issue. The point is that a number of 
Ukrainian military educational institutions offer training not 
available in Russia. At the same time, there is no need for us 
to open new departments or institutes provided we can train our 
specialists in the neighboring state. An agreement was also 
reached regarding a balanced approach to nuclear issues and the 
dispute over the Black Sea Fleet. 
  [Chernomorskiy] Our newspaper has been receiving a lot of 
letters from mothers of soldiers drafted in spring 1992. Were 
it not for the Supreme Council decree prolonging their term of 
service, those soldiers would have returned home by now. 
  [Radetskyy] I will be happy to reassure mothers with your 
newspaper's assistance. I want to point out that this is a 
temporary measure. On the one hand, we are reducing our Armed 
Forces now and that will alleviate the demand for manpower. 
Secondly, I believe that our lawmakers will review the 
categories of draftees excused from active service. I also hope 
that the number of young people dodging the draft will 
substantially decrease. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Kostenko; from the "Voskresenye" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Kostenko] The situation in 
Sevastopol can already be likened to a state of emergency. One 
ruble fetches 25 coupons today. For the most part, people get 
to work on foot -- there are few cars around, as there is 
virtually no gasoline to be found anywhere. These warships have 
not left their moorings for several months now. The vast 
majority of officers have remained loyal and true to the oath 
they swore. And every day, early in the morning, the old 
power's navy ensign is raised high above the warship's stern, 
and they salute it. It is almost all they have left. The 
actual purchasing power of a Black Sea naval officer's wage is 
five times lower than that of his counterpart in, say, the 
Baltic Fleet. Rubles sent from Russia are converted into 
karbovantsy according to the official state exchange rate, and 
not the market rate -- that is, at a rate of 4:1 rather than 
25:1. The fleet pays customs duties on imported food, fuel, and 
various types of equipment -- including things brought in for 
the Ukrainian Navy. It pays for the use of land, roads, and 
test ranges. The Ukrainian Army is exempt from such taxes. 
What's more, according to some statistics, 40 percent of the 
strategic reserves in Ukraine have already been used up. 
Meanwhile, a Russian officer coming to serve in Sevastopol has 
to pay Ukrainian customs officers almost a whole month's salary. 
In November, 52 billion karbovantsy deposited in Black Sea 
Fleet accounts in Ukrainian banks were frozen. This money had 
been sent over from Russia to build homes for naval officers. 
It was finally released in December following wholesale price 
increases in Ukraine, only to become a pile of worthless bits of 
paper. Russia has long borne nigh-on three-quarters of the 
expenses of maintaining a fleet on the Black Sea. Ongoing talks 
on the future of the fleet and of Sevastopol have in practice 
led nowhere. Many people here in Sevastopol believe that the 
option of transferring the fleet's main base to Russia on a 
leasehold basis should suit everybody. That way, Yeltsin will 
not look like an occupier, nor Kravchuk a traitor.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vasyl Vasylyovych Durdynets, first deputy </F>
chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council, by unidentified HOLOS 
UKRAYINY correspondent; place and date not given: "The Time To 
Adopt Crucial Decisions"] 
  [Text] The eighth session of Ukraine's Supreme 
Council was held in conditions of an exacerbation of critical 
phenomena in the economic, social, and political spheres and an 
intensification of the social tension in society. What are its 
achievements? What could it elaborate? What is awaiting the 
Ukrainian parliament in 1994? Our correspondent talks about 
this with first deputy chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council, 
V.V. Durdynets. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Esteemed Vasyl Vasylyovych, the present 
situation in Ukraine is difficult. The prestige of the power 
structures has been shaken. Notwithstanding this, many people 
still believe in our state's supreme legislative body. This 
follows at least from the fact that people gather precisely 
under the windows of the parliament building in order to express 
their dissatisfaction with something, expound their demands, or 
simply hold discussions with people's deputies. Therefore, they 
hope that parliament is still capable of doing something to 
build up the state. Has the eighth session justified these 
expectations? Which of the legislative acts adopted by it can 
be assessed by you as fundamental and leading? 
  [Durdynets] Well, this question is not a simple one, and I 
would generally agree with the emphasis that you have placed in 
it. However, one point needs to be better specified: Today, 
people do not only pin their hopes on the Supreme Council, but, 
to a no lesser degree, on the bodies of executive power, the 
president, and the Cabinet of Ministers, which are directly 
responsible for the fulfillment of the laws and decrees that 
have been adopted. People gather at the square in front of the 
Supreme Council mainly on the days of plenary sessions in order 
to hold a direct dialogue. This is, undoubtedly, mutually 
useful. 
  As regards the work of the eighth session, it was really 
held 
in difficult conditions. It is worth stressing here that this 
session adopted quite a number of exclusively important 
legislative acts, which may be called a political reaction on 
the part of the legislators to the topical demands of our time. 
The session worked very hard and was very productive. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Before closing the session, Ivan 
Stepanovych Plyushch quoted some figures.... 
  [Durdynets] Yes, Ivan Stepanovych quoted specific figures. 
In terms of quantitative indexes, the session differs from 
others. Its 52 meetings discussed 249 questions and adopted 66 
laws and 133 decrees. 
  However, it is not only by this that I would characterize 
the 
session. It must be said, first and foremost, that, by passing 
the law on the early elections of the Supreme Council and 
president, it responded to the need to renew the power 
structures, a need that has become felt in our society. 
  The Law on the Elections of Ukraine's People's Deputies was 
adopted and the composition of the Central Electoral Commission 
was approved. In fact, the adoption of these documents marked 
the beginning of the pre-election campaign. The people were 
given a chance to delegate their new envoys to the Supreme 
Council, and the political parties -- their representatives. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] At its eighth session, the Supreme Council 
repeatedly discussed the issue of the economic situation in 
Ukraine and of the social protection of the population. The 
"dialogue" between the people's deputies and the Cabinet of 
Ministers was quite sharp. The government has changed three 
times over the three years. A number of laws and decrees have 
been adopted. What positive changes have taken place? What has 
the Supreme Council managed to achieve, in your opinion? 
  [Durdynets] Economic and, in particular, social problems 
were and still are the most painful ones for our society. It is 
clear that the economic situation in Ukraine is also quite 
noticeably affected by foreign factors and by the still severed 
production ties within what used to be a single national 
economic complex. Nor is the structural and technological 
rebuilding of Ukraine's economy proceeding smoothly: It is too 
delayed, sluggish, and has many shortcomings. However, our 
misfortunes are largely due to strictly internal problems, 
inefficient administration, and errors in the implementation of 
reforms. 
  Unfortunately, the economic programs, including those 
proposed by previous governments, have not produced positive 
results. The expanding spiral of inflation and the uncontrolled 
price increases have led to a drastic deterioration of the 
people's standard of living. In the course of the eighth 
session, the Supreme Council had to adopt nine legislative acts 
directly associated with the social protection of the 
population. I mean the Law on the Status of War Veterans and 
Guarantees of Their Social Protection, the Law on the Main 
Principles of the Social Protection of Veterans of Labor and 
Other Citizens of Old Age, changes to the Law on State 
Assistance for Families With Children, the Decree on Urgent 
Measures for Overcoming Hyperinflation in Ukraine, and other 
legislative acts. 
  It is important to emphasize that, in view of the conditions 
that have recently taken shape in the state, the Supreme Council 
adopted, a few days ago, a new Concept for the Social Protection 
of Ukraine's Population. It has laid down the principles for 
the legal and formative foundation for social protection and 
elaborated mechanisms that, proceeding from the actual economic 
possibilities, will ensure the fulfillment of state guarantees 
regarding the implementation of the citizens' rights to labor 
and unemployment benefits: Remuneration for labor and minimal 
wages; provision of state assistance and other types of social 
assistance for low-income citizens and families with children. 
  Yet another important principle, which follows from the 
concept, is that the system of social protection must be built 
in such a way as to prevent egalitarianism and moods of 
parasitism from prevailing during the distribution and 
consumption of benefits. This system must not weaken the 
motivations and incentives for labor, but must create conditions 
for their fullest possible manifestation. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Some politicians assert that it is 
precisely the Supreme Council that raises prices.... 
  [Durdynets] There are such politicians, but they cannot 
confirm this with a single document. The Supreme Council has 
not made a single decision to raise prices. On the contrary, as 
you remember, last spring, it imposed a moratorium on price 
increases, but owing to the government's persistent requests 
(the government assured us at that time that it was the last 
price increase), the Supreme Council agreed to authorize the 
decision. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] How about the considerable price increases 
in December? 
  [Durdynets] It is precisely on this that I want to stress 
that the last month of work of the Supreme Council's eighth 
session was particularly strained. In connection with the sharp 
price increases and popular discontent, the situation called for 
urgent and extraordinary measures on the part of the Supreme 
Council, the president, and the government. After the 
discussion, which continued for many days, of the reports by 
Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Chairman of the Board 
of Ukraine's National Bank Viktor Yushchenko, Minister of 
Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, and Minister of the Economy Roman 
Shpek, the Supreme Council passed, on 17 December, an important 
decree on the economic and social situation in Ukraine with 
specific recommendations for the emergence from the economic 
crisis and, a week later, a decree on additional measures for 
stabilizing the socio-economic situation. In my opinion, these 
documents will somewhat mitigate the situation. Certainly, 
provided that strict control is established over the timely and 
thorough fulfillment of the regulations on stabilizing the 
socio-economic situation and overcoming inflation. Here, the 
standing commissions of deputies must actively interact with the 
executive bodies. At the ninth session, which will start on 20 
January, the Supreme Council will analyze how these decrees have 
been fulfilled. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] At the beginning of the interview, you 
mentioned legislative laws adopted by the eighth session as a 
response to the need for a political renewal in society. Unlike 
some politicians, you seem to be convinced that elections will 
be held. Am I right? Another question: Will it not happen 
that quite a number of those people's deputies who, today, work 
actively and competently on commissions, will not be elected to 
parliament for the simple reason that they appear in front of 
the microphones or at rostrums less frequently? 
  [Durdynets] I will start with your second question: It will 
be a pity if this happens. It is a fact that a professional 
nucleus of legislators, highly erudite politicians responsible 
to the state and the people, has formed in the present 
parliament. However, I hope that these deputies will continue 
to serve our country. It is high time that we created a 
civilized and professional parliament. 
  As regards new elections, it will not be simple to hold 
them. 
However, I do not think that the majority of voters will not 
come to the polling stations at all, as some people predict. I 
hope not. It cannot happen that the majority of voters will not 
care who works in parliament and who will come there. The law 
passed is not as bad as some people picture it. It is 
democratic. I am sure that the majority of citizens in our 
society are mature enough to have a profound understanding that 
it is precisely they who must form a new parliament through 
elections and take care of their own future. This is, 
incidentally, attested to by the political tension in the state. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Perhaps, the discussion of the draft of the 
new constitution of Ukraine should be placed into the category 
of key problems? 
  [Durdynets] Undoubtedly. The work on the draft of the new 
constitution was quite time-consuming. It is the main law of 
the state, and the deputies consider its elaboration to be a 
particularly important matter. The eighth session discussed the 
draft into which the Constitutional Commission introduced 
fundamental changes and additions -- taking into account the 
results of the nationwide discussions. Much time was devoted to 
its discussion at plenary meetings. The deputies were able to 
analyze the draft in depth. 
  Many important remarks and proposals were voiced in the 
course of the discussion. They refer to all parts of the draft, 
but in particular, to those articles that deal with the general 
principles of the constitutional system, democracy, the 
electoral process, forms of state power and administration, the 
main principles of Ukraine's territorial system, and the 
organization of state power and self-government in the 
provinces. I want to stress that different points of view were 
voiced in the course of the discussions, but one could feel a 
constructive approach in assessing the draft constitution and 
the desire to find the best variant, which would take into 
account the experience of democratic countries and our national 
traditions and specific features of state building. 
  It was decided to publish the draft constitution in the 
press once more, so that all the citizens of Ukraine could 
familiarize themselves with it. The Constitutional Commission, 
which generalizes the proposals made by the people's deputies, 
is already receiving letters with specific proposals. We expect 
that the question of the new constitution will also be discussed 
in substance at the conference of the representatives of local 
councils of Ukraine's people's deputies, which will be held on 
18 and 19 January. We are also thinking how to speed up the 
amendment and adoption of the new constitution, because it is 
extremely difficult to build a young state without new main law. 
Ukraine needs a new constitution. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] The ratification by parliament of START I 
and of the Lisbon Protocol gave rise to very strong reactions, 
which are also quite controversial. How would you comment on 
this? 
  [Durdynets] Right, the adoption, on 18 November, by the 
Supreme Council of the decree on the ratification of these 
documents gave rise to a considerable response in the world. 
The numerous reactions and commentaries by state and political 
circles point to their understanding of the motivations for 
adopting such a decision. At the same time, some political 
figures and mass media offered interpretations of some aspects 
of the decree that differ from what they really meant. 
  As you know, the adoption by the Supreme Council of the 
decision on the ratification was preceded by an almost year-long 
discussion and thorough collective analysis of possible 
military, political, economic, ecological, and social 
consequences of the implementation by our state of this treaty, 
which had been concluded without Ukraine's participation. In 
their approach to this issue, the parliament, its standing 
commissions, and the temporary working group of deputies, 
created to pass the corresponding recommendations, proceeded 
both from Ukraine's noble intention to become, in the future, a 
nuclear state and from the ideas of the inviolability of state 
borders, as well as from other national interests. In the 
course of the in-depth and comprehensive study of the problems, 
the deputies also paid attention to such a serious matter as the 
economic feasibility for our state to fulfill, to a full extent, 
the obligations that are stipulated by the treaty. 
  We have striven to convince the international community, and 
first and foremost nuclear and other influential world powers, 
that it is essential for them to make reciprocal steps and offer 
Ukraine reliable security guarantees and provide it with proper 
financial assistance, enabling it to destroy those weapons, and 
to compensate us for the nuclear warheads. Unfortunately, our 
hopes were futile. 
  That is why the Supreme Council, while adopting the decision 
on the ratification of START I with reservations, took these 
aspects into account and proceeded from the real situation that 
had taken shape. Incidentally, recent events, and particularly 
openly anti- Ukrainian statements made by individual Russian 
political and state figures, justified our position. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] The problems of combating crime in our 
country continue to be acute. How were they dealt with by the 
Supreme Council? 
  [Durdynets] The deputies analyzed these problems with great 
concern, because the growth of crime, and in particular 
organized crime, are a matter of serious concern to our society. 
This problem is constantly within the Supreme Council's field 
of vision. This session alone approved more than 20 normative 
acts intended to strengthen law and order and intensify the 
struggle against crime, in particular, laws on more severe 
punishment for certain crimes against the state and on the state 
protection of court and law- enforcement officials; the draft 
law on combating corruption was given its first reading. 
Important changes and additions were introduced into the 
Criminal and Criminal-Procedural Codes and other legal acts. 
Active work is under way on the elaboration of new codes. 
  Serious criticisms were directed against the Procurator 
General's Office in connection with the shortcomings in its 
work. The Supreme Council strengthened the leadership -- a new 
Procurator General was appointed and a new composition of the 
board approved. Changes were introduced into the Law on the 
Procurator's Office that are intended to improve its work. 
  A number of acts that were adopted are aimed at reforming 
the 
judicial power and improving legal proceedings. A new 
leadership of Ukraine's Supreme Court was elected. 
  The main task now is to strengthen parliamentary control 
over 
the implementation of legislation on legal issues and to combine 
the efforts of executive and law-enforcement agencies in 
combating crime. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] However, one does hear much more criticism 
than approval of the Supreme Council's activities.... 
  [Durdynets] All of this is understandable. Life does not 
get any better, and the legal acts that are adopted do not, 
unfortunately, work the way in which we would like them to. 
Incidentally, many voters judge the Supreme Council's work only 
by the plenary meetings. They do not see the colossal, 
painstaking, and, I would say, very hard work done by the 
Presidium, standing commissions, and subdivisions of the Supreme 
Council apparatus. Every issue, no matter how unimportant it may 
be, is subjected to expert analysis by specialists and is 
discussed in deputies' groups and commissions before it is put 
on the agenda of the plenary meeting. Diverse, sometimes 
opposite, ideas and proposals need to be studied, substantiated, 
and compared in order to enable a proper decision to be made. 
  For example, I mentioned two extremely important decrees 
adopted by the Supreme Council at the end of the session -- on 
the economic and social situation in Ukraine and on measures to 
stabilize the socio-economic situation in the state. A special 
working group had been created to prepare this. It included 
people's deputies, ministers, and specialists -- economists and 
lawyers. I happened to be the head of this group. We worked 
hard for several days and nights. Everything was there -- sharp 
discussions, opposite views, and some peoples' narrow 
departmental ambitions. We had to go through all of this to 
reach a compromise and arrive at coordinated and well-weighed 
decisions that would take into account the numerous appeals from 
the provinces and proposals made by people's deputies. Believe 
me, this was a very difficult task. We have to make the 
decisions, as people expect us to do. 
  I must say that, since these decisions were made, the 
government has made considerable efforts to implement them. 
There are great difficulties here. 
  [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Before the end of the last plenary meeting, 
it was announced that the next session, the ninth, will start 
work on 20 January. Meanwhile, one hears doubts: Will the 
Supreme Council be able to work at full capacity if some of the 
deputies become involved in the pre-election struggle? 
  [Durdynets] The ninth session will primarily discuss two 
most important issues -- the plan for Ukraine's economic and 
social development and the draft state budget for 1994. They 
were on the agenda of the eighth session, but the Cabinet of 
Ministers was unable, for various reasons, to submit these bills 
on time. 
  Of course, this cannot be considered a normal situation, 
when 
a new year starts and there is still no plan for the country's 
economic and social development and no state budget. That is 
why the deputies at the session sharply criticized the 
government for such a delay. We hope that the drafts of these 
documents will be submitted to the Supreme Council within the 
first 10 days of January. By the beginning of plenary meetings, 
the deputies will be able to analyze them in detail in standing 
commissions. Until the budget for 1994 is adopted, the Supreme 
Council, by its decree of 24 December allowed the government and 
the National Bank to carry out the financing of immediate 
expenditure in January 1994 within the limits of real 
contributions to the budget. 
  I will also list those issues whose discussion cannot be 
delayed in view of their social significance. These are, in 
particular, the draft state program for privatization meant for 
next year. It must take into account the best experience 
accumulated by other countries and our specific characteristics 
and mistakes so that it would open the way to an intensification 
of the economic reforms. 
  We must discuss the second reading of the bill on combating 
crime and introduce the appropriate changes into Ukraine's 
Criminal and Criminal-Procedural Codes. It is not necessary to 
prove the great need for this law today, when corruption 
seriously threatens the development of our national economy. 
  The Supreme Council must discuss the amended draft concept 
of 
Ukraine's national security (policy principles). As is known, 
this global issue was discussed at the eighth session, but the 
discussion was not finished. 
  There also are a number of bills that were already passed at 
first reading. They are expected in particular sectors. Some 
of the currently effective legal acts also need to be altered 
and supplemented. However, is it possible to put all of them 
into the "working portfolio" of the future parliament? 
  Therefore, I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of 
the deputies will consider these questions with great 
responsibility and that the ninth session will work in a normal 
and businesslike manner. Now, during the period between the 
sessions, standing commissions do not halt their legislative 
work and also conduct checks on the implementation of the laws 
and the decisions that have been made. 
  I am using this opportunity to greet all Ukrainian citizens 
and their families for Christmas and the New Year and wish them 
happiness, prosperity, peace, accord, and a better life. 
  Thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Vladimir Grinev in </F>
Kiev by correspondent Boris Sverdlov; date not given: "We Must 
Learn from Russia"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- What was essentially a sensation took place 
at the first presidential elections in Ukraine. Vladimir 
Grinev, a quite youthful doctor of science from Kharkov, took 
third place among the six candidates. Recalling the contest, 
Vladimir Borisovich says: "At the time I was only trying my 
strength. Today I am feeling more resolute." 
  To judge by the mounting authority of the "New Ukraine" 
movement he heads, in the opinion of sociologists he has quite 
good chances of becoming head of state. Especially as he has 
coordinated his actions with the no less popular candidate 
Leonid Kuchma. They will go to the new presidential elections 
together. 
  Nonetheless Grinev believes that at the present stage for 
Ukraine the election of a new president is not the main issue. 
Beginning radical reforms without delay is far more urgent. 
Because for the young independent state which has come under the 
pressure of economic and political collapse delay is like death. 
  [Grinev] I believe that Ukraine has fallen into a quagmire 
because of an abominable domestic and foreign policy, he says. 
Having won independence through suffering, its president and 
Supreme Soviet decided to set off on their journey with the old 
administrative-edict baggage. And without making any moves in 
the direction of reform. And a state with an enormous domestic 
potential in industry and agriculture ran aground. The attempt 
to retain all-embracing state control over the economy naturally 
ended in catastrophe. 
  Successes are no better in foreign policy. Ukraine is so 
integrated with the East that in the next few decades it will be 
unable to exist without it. But politicians see a threat to its 
sovereignty from Russia. But the threat in fact does not come 
from Russia, as the national-radicals are trying to persuade us, 
but from spurning rapprochement with our Eastern neighbor. 
Without Russia and the CIS countries, without economic alliance 
with them, it is impossible to improve the prosperity of a 
people driven into deep poverty. 
  From my viewpoint, we must immediate eliminate border 
barriers which impede the movement of citizens, goods, and 
capital. Ukraine is most interested in this. And of course we 
are perturbed by RUKH leaders' statements that the thwarting of 
the ratification of the treaty on economic alliance is a victory 
for the democratic forces. The president, instead of adopting a 
firm stance on such a decisive issue, has resorted to his 
favorite method -- maneuvering and playing word games with 
himself. 
  Meanwhile we have contrived to lag very considerably behind 
Russia. I view economic alliance with it primarily as a 
prerequisite for joint movement along the path of reforms. 
  [Sverdlov] So the present authorities cannot amend anything? 
  [Grinev] Naturally. The question today is this: Can the 
present authorities bring Ukraine to the repeat elections 
without cataclysms and in general will we live to see the repeat 
elections? I can reply in the affirmative. 
  [Sverdlov] If you are elected president what first three 
edicts will you issue? 
  [Grinev] The first will be on the land market, the second 
on the capital market, the third on the real estate market. It 
is naive to believe that without putting these levers into 
operation we can, for instance, stabilize the financial system. 
  [Sverdlov] As deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet you 
suggested to parliament your own economic program for Ukraine's 
resurrection. But it was not supported.... 
  [Grinev] There is nothing surprising in that. The 
parliament tried to do in the old way what cannot be resolved 
under the new conditions. But, you see, I mounted the rostrum 
with the demand that the economy be reformed through the market. 
It is a good thing I was not hissed off the platform. I 
realized then that I could not deal with that Supreme Soviet and 
I resigned. 
  Today there are at least five or six fine programs for 
stabilizing the economy. And they have all been shelved merely 
because there is no one to implement them. Neither the 
president nor the parliament relies on a single political force. 
  [Sverdlov] You are running with Leonid Kuchma in the 
election campaign. Are you not afraid? After all, it was under 
Leonid Kuchma that Ukraine's economy started to crack at the 
seams. 
  [Grinev] To be precise the seams had cracked under the 
former premier. Incidentally, Kuchma's popularity rating is 
increasing. He is a man who only tells the truth and who, 
counter to politicians of a nationalist bent, who have only an 
anti-Russian syndrome to their name, he is resolutely advocating 
rapprochement with Russia. And to all appearances the majority 
of voters are in solidarity with him.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 8 Jan -- Speaking on a Crimean radio 
program, Ivan Yermakov, head of the Sevastopol state 
administration, sharply criticized the leadership of Ukraine, 
saying that the Ukrainian Government's policy was leading to the 
impoverishment of the population, first of all, in Sevastopol. 
At the same time, Ivan Yermakov spoke emphatically against the 
transfer of the Crimea to Russia: "One should not rush events 
and promise the unfeasible. This would lead to critical 
developments," Yermakov said. He spoke in favor of Ukraine, 
Russia, and Belarus joining in a political and economic union.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The citizens of Ukraine have gotten used to 
surprises of all kinds from the government. In December they 
had time to resign themselves to the latest surprise, and not 
the most painful: under the new television broadcasting 
schedules, television channels have been working only from 1800 
until midnight on working days. 
  Broadcasting resumed in full in the New Year, but it turns 
out that viewers' rejoicing was premature. This was just a 
small Christmas present, and the restrictions come back into 
force on 10 January. Naturally the official reason remains the 
same: the shortage of electric power. However, local 
authorities in certain regions do not conceal their own view on 
the matter, using figures to prove how small the savings have 
been as a result of these restrictions and describing them as 
primarily a political move.

  [Text] While reports of an impending currency reform which 
are sweeping the Ukraine are mere rumors at the moment, hryvnas 
are already being traded openly on the main market in 
Zaporozhye, the homeland of the Ukrainian Cossacks. Both 
bankers and law enforcement agencies are worried at this 
development. They want to know how the new banknotes, which 
were printed in Canada and, supposedly, kept securely under lock 
and key, turned up on Zaporozhye's black market. By all 
accounts, the black marketeers already know what the exchange 
rate for the new currency will be. 
  One hryvna is being exchanged for 24,000 karbovantsi, only 
50 
percent less than the U.S. dollar.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Popular Front Chairman Zyanon </F>
Paznyak by Vital Tsyhankow; place and date not given: "Zyanon 
Paznyak: `Empire Cannot Be Democratic' -- Belarusian Popular 
Front Chairman on Russia and Russian Elections"] 
  [Text] [Tsyhankow] How do you assess the results of the 
elections in Russia? Were they a surprise to you? 
  [Paznyak] The results of the elections are natural for an 
empire that is experiencing a deep socioeconomic crisis. Such 
situations bring people to power who address the lower instincts 
of the lumpen-proletariat and promise too much. This is a 
well-known path by which some European countries have gone and 
by which Russia is now going. The results of the elections were 
not startling for the Belarusian Popular Front [BPF]. Moreover, 
we did not expect that the elections could improve the political 
situation in Russia, because the political platforms of Russian 
political parties were nourished by imperial trends. All of 
them, in greater or lesser degree, backed a general Russian 
imperial mood because -- and I would like to repeat this again 
-- an empire cannot be democratic. That is an axiom. 
  It is evident that Russia is developing in an antidemocratic 
way -- this is natural for Russia, though it is at the same time 
a tragic way for events to develop. All the power will be 
polarized (not only the State Duma!), with the mutual opposition 
of the president and legislature. All this can lead to civil 
war, even to global war. 
  Speaking about the results of elections in Russia, we can 
state the complete failure of Western policy toward Russia. The 
West has once again demonstrated its complete misunderstanding 
of the events in the former states of the USSR. In general, I 
assess the Western policy as being Philistine. A similar policy 
had caused the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentropp Treaty in the 
1930's.... The policy directed at the creation of a democratic 
Russia is illusory as long as Russia remains an empire. 
However, it can exist only as an empire.... 
  [Tsyhankow] That is to say, you think that Russia can exist 
only as an empire or it better cease to exist at all? 
  [Paznyak] Yes, this is the case. 
  [Tsyhankow] Does this fit the interests of the world 
community? 
  [Paznyak] Yes, it will be better when an empire ceases to 
exist. Having reached the peak of its economic potential in the 
19th-20th centuries, Russia became a source of military danger. 
An empire is always extending its borders, it is ready to 
swallow the entire world, foreign cultures and economies and 
later deem them Russian. The Romans thought this way, so what 
happened later? The Roman Empire collapsed, the Roman nation 
and language disappeared. 
  The Russian nation should specify its nationality. It is 
always the national culture that is aspiring to develop and 
defend its creative potential. Currently, the Russians have an 
imperial consciousness and think along imperial lines. 
  [Tsyhankow] How can Russians understand that they need to 
split the Russian Federation? 
  [Paznyak] It is impossible to realize. This topic demands a 
lot of time and we are limited to a newspaper interview. 
However, you should realize: Russia is an empire whose 
population thinks along imperial lines. 
  [Tsyhankow] It is a vicious circle. Is there a way out? 
  [Paznyak] In the opinion of BPF, the way out lies in the 
creation of a counterbalance in East Europe. The Baltic-Black 
Sea Association will stabilize the situation in this part of 
Europe. This idea was born in Belarus in 1916. The empire can 
start falling and this dangerous and lengthy process should be 
kept under control. 
  [Tsyhankow] How do the results of the Russian elections 
effect the pro-communist Supreme Soviet majority who advocate a 
close union with Russia? 
  [Paznyak] Communism and fascism have the same roots, they 
have similar ideas and symbols. On a certain level of 
development, they can change color and even unite with someone 
else. However, history demonstrates that communists will never 
share power with other political forces. By the way, Russian 
history is a vivid example of this: Communists required only a 
single night to murder the members of several political parties! 
Communists are ready to unite with anyone, however, they will 
betray and do away with their allies as soon as they secure 
unlimited power. When the position of communists in the State 
Duma is strengthened, their Belarusian colleagues will resume 
their activities. 
  Currently, Belarusian communists are at a crossroads -- they 
do not know what to do. Please, pay attention to this: More 
than two weeks have passed since the Russian elections were 
held, and our Supreme Soviet is still silent on the issue; as if 
Russia has ceased to exist. 
  [Text] [Tsyhankow] What conclusions has the BPF made? 
  [Paznyak] We propose nothing extraordinary. There are legal 
norms according to which the international community should 
operate. These legal norms were violated for decades and only 
now are they being revived. Belarus should introduce its own 
national currency and carry out an independent national policy 
or, in other words, Belarus should force the world to recognize 
it so it can reap the fruits of its labor. 
  The second and more significant conclusion concerns nuclear 
weapons. When adventurers seize power in a nuclear state and 
plan to wage aggressive wars and change borders, they should not 
get access to the nuclear button. This is clear to everybody. 
Therefore, Ukraine and Belarus should both give back their 
nuclear missiles to Russia. Belarus does not require nuclear 
weapons and I want to remind you that the BPF was the first to 
propose that a nonnuclear and neutral status of a Belarusian 
state become a constitutional requirement. We do not need 
nuclear weapons but we cannot give back the nuclear warheads to 
politicians who can start a world war. 
  [Tsyhankow] In your opinion, can the acting Belarusian 
Government arrive at the same conclusion? 
  [Paznyak] It is not difficult to draw this conclusion, 
however, our cabinet members are busy discussing an issue of 
corruption in high places and are anxious over how to stay in 
power. The problem is that we cannot destroy our weapons 
without our Western partners -- it is an expensive affair. Even 
today Belarus is dismantling its tanks and missiles, however, no 
other state in the world is doing the same. All this is done at 
the expense of Belarusian taxpayers and without any Western aid. 
What is it? If the West is not going to aid us in the future, 
we should find another way out of this predicament. 
  [Tsyhankow] Can we expect that the policy of the West toward 
Russia will change? It will be more embarrassing to change 
their policy after the presidential elections are held in Russia. 
  [Paznyak] All the political, moral, and financial support of 
the West is going to Russia, while Belarus and Ukraine are 
completely ignored. The West authorized Russia (with its huge 
oil and gas potential) to subordinate Belarus and Ukraine. The 
West did it consciously, pretending that it was pursuing a wise 
policy of creating a "democratic Russia." 
  However, if the West is concerned with the spreading of 
European civilization, it should have started with the 
strengthening of Baltic, Belarusian, and Ukrainian statehood. 
The West should not have earmarked credits to this procommunist 
regime but should have rendered moral and political support to 
democratic forces. We do not even require their money -- we 
have both labor and intellect. We require consultative visits by 
foreign experts. We do not get this -- all the aid is directed 
to Russian, where people fight and kill each other. 
  Will the West change its position on the issue? Of course, 
they will introduce some changes. However, as far as my 
personal opinion is concerned, the Western mind is very inert 
and slow, and cannot be radically changed in a short period of 
time. The West thinks that Russia and its neighbors are far 
away, however, they are very close to its door.... I am scared 
that the West will unwillingly -- as was done with Hitler -- 
help Russian fascists come to power.

  [Text] The second stage of reform in the Belarusian Armed 
Forces will be completed in 1994. According to reports from the 
republic, the strength of the Belarusian Army will be reduced to 
100,000 men. This is three times less than the strength of the 
military grouping inherited from the former Soviet Union. 
According to the Belarusian defense doctrine law, the strength 
of the national army should be within the limits needed to 
ensure the country's sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Report by Mircea Dascaliuc from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] Moldovan Parliament Speaker Petru Lucinschi today 
received Petre Roman and Eugen Dijmarescu [leaders of the 
Democratic Party-National Salvation Front -- PD-FSN, of 
Romania], who are in Chisinau after having accompanied a 
humanitarian convoy that conveyed gifts to the children of 
Moldova. 
  During the talks, the officials briefed one another on the 
current situation in the two countries, laying special emphasis 
on finding ways for achieving real cooperation in the future 
between the two countries. They also tackled financial, 
economic, law-making, social, and political issues. 
  Lucinschi presented the situation in the eastern and 
southern 
rayons of Moldova, detailing the difficulties facing the 
leadership of Moldova in ensuring legality in those areas. In 
that context, Lucinschi made some remarks referring to the 
situation of the Ilie Ilascu group [imprisoned and sentenced to 
death by the authorities of the self-proclaimed Dniester 
Republic], assessing that within a short time, the entire group 
will be transferred to Chisinau and handed over to the 
authorities of Moldova. 
  Assessing Romanian-Moldova relations, the speaker of the 
Moldovan Parliament asserted that, unfortunately, the results 
obtained so far in the furthering of those ties do not 
correspond to what was originally intended and expressed his 
hope that in the future the cooperation between the two states 
will develop from mere declarations to concrete actions, 
including in the law-making field. 
  The meeting was also attended by Marian Enache, Romania's 
ambassador to Chisinau.

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 8/01/1994 -- From our 
correspondent: The United Workers' Committee (OSTK) in Tiraspol 
pronounces against the transfer of the Ilascu group to other 
states [the Republic of Moldova]. It is also against the 
reduction of the imprisonment period. Valeriu Garbuz [prisoner 
who acted as a witness incriminating the others] could be an 
exception, states the OSTK declaration announced by the local 
radio. The OSTK leaders believe that the transfer of the 
convicted to another state could be made only on the basis of an 
international agreement concerning this field. OSTK opposes 
that Moldova's [February] general elections should also be held 
in the Dniester Republic. OSTK does not support the idea of a 
referendum on the future social and state order in the Dniester 
region. The idea of this referendum was launched by the union 
of parties, organizations, and social movements. In OSTK's 
opinion, the results of the referendum can be used by enemies of 
the Dniester Republic to undermine the state order.

  [Text] A new party, the Civilized Dniester 
[Tsivilizovannoye Pridnestrovye], has been set up in the Dnester 
region. The party's main social aims are that each family in 
the Dniestr region should enjoy modern housing with full 
amenities with at least 20 square meters per person, a car, a 
telephone, good furniture, and television and video recorder. 
Creators of this party believe their action program is similar 
to those of President Boris Yeltsin's team, Yegor Gaydar and 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, as well as programs of democrats and 
reformists in Ukraine and Moldova. Its leaders stated that 
their party will strive for the Dnestr republic achieving a 
status that would guarantee conditions for civilized democratic 
development, irrespective of what happens in the main territory 
of Moldova. The party's efforts will be directed to achieving 
the lasting peace in the region.

  [Text] A session of the Cabinet of Ministers took place 
yesterday, chaired by Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko. Under 
examination was the republic's draft budget for the current 
year, which had been sent earlier for finalizing. It was noted 
that a complex situation had developed in the credit and 
financial sphere. A lot of difficulties have been experienced 
with ensuring revenue for the budget. 
  However, a 1994 draft budget gives us hope that its 
implementation will change the republic's socio-economic life 
for the better. First of all, it is based on the national 
currency. Secondly, it has taken into account recommendations of 
international financial organizations, such as the IMF and the 
World Bank. Thirdly, it pursues a tough policy which is dictated 
by the needs of market economy. At the same time, we should 
support the less well off sections of society. Social support 
should be targeted and preserved. It was decided to submit the 
draft budget for consideration by the president of the republic. 
  The government's report on the main issues of a program for 
systematic and economic transformations for 1994 was also 
approved by the session. This report will be submitted for 
consideration by the Paris meeting of the IMF consultative group 
on 14 January.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Kazakhstan: They Finished Celebrating </F>
and... Found Themselves Faced With the Market"] 
  [Text] The first week of the new year has literally made 
every inhabitant of Kazakhstan face up to the market. The 
policy pursued by the republic's government last year of 
artificially containing inflation and the attempts to protect 
the population by means of the usual "socialist distribution 
methods" ended in failure. Kazakhstan has adopted extraordinary 
measures to regulate the funds channeled into consumption. 
  Journalists have called the decree of the State Commission 
for the Introduction of a National Currency, published here 
during the first days of January, "the first dose of shock 
therapy" in the republic. According to this decree, wages and 
all forms of remuneration will now be coordinated strictly with 
the amount and quality of work done. So Kazakhstan's experiment 
in "distributive entry into the market" is over. What is 
essentially the first attempt, founded on market laws, to lay a 
reliable foundation for increasing the amounts of output, goods, 
and services produced has begun. 
  The aim set by the Kazakhstan Government is more than 
obvious, although the local press is in no hurry to comment on 
the deep-seated reasons for what happened. Moreover, the true 
dynamics of the inflation which gripped the republic were 
persistently concealed from the republic's inhabitants for many 
months. It is vexing that the unprecedentedly large increase in 
food prices announced 5 January also passed without comment in 
the press. For example, the cost of one liter of milk increased 
sixfold! This means that one more good intention of the 
republic's government -- that "everything will be settled as 
before" -- has burst. The fixed prices introduced by the 
republic's government two months ago in connection with the 
switch to a national currency have failed to withstand the 
pressure of inflation. All fixed prices, with the exception of 
bread prices, were abolished as of 5 January. This means that 
Kazakhstan is the first country in the Central Asian region to 
abandon regulated food prices and has been forced to let them 
float freely. 
  "Russia has survived a price shock, and Kazakhstan will also 
cope with it," local journalists sympathizing with the 
parliamentary bloc of optimistic marketeers commented on the 
present situation.

  [Text] Dear compatriots. Orthodox believers are 
celebrating their great festival on 7 January, the birthday of 
Christ. I congratulate in a most heartfelt way all our 
Christian citizens on their great holiday and wish every success 
in their work for the benefit of our motherland, health, and 
happiness. May this solemn festivity unite Kyrgyzstanis around 
the ideals of good, justice, mutual tolerance, and respect. We 
highly value the activity of the Orthodox church aimed at 
consolidation of compatriots irrespective of their outlook and 
political beliefs, for strengthening of civil peace and 
interethnic accord, and for spiritual renewal of our existence. 
  Our state sees its duty in helping people to share eternal 
spiritual values. The new constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, 
which guarantees rights for freedom of belief and for spiritual 
and cultural freedom opens up the way to a civilized human 
communication based on cooperation, mutual help, and unification 
of all creative forces. 
  I am convinced that this will play an important role in 
overcoming the current difficulties and creating the life which 
our people deserve. Happy Christmas!

  [Text] In conformity with the law of the Kyrgyz Republic on 
the customs tariff, and in order to further improve the system 
of the state regulation of foreign trade as well as to create 
conditions for the development of interstate economic ties, the 
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic issued a resolution on the 
introduction of temporary customs tariffs of the Kyrgyz 
Republic. The temporary customs tariff of the Kyrgyz Republic 
was confirmed. Special duties have been introduced temporarily 
as a precaution against participants of foreign economic 
activity who violate the interests of the Kyrgyz Republic 
concerning importing of goods in line with the direct exchange 
of goods -- barter. Tariffs and duties are levied on all 
exported and imported goods that are included in the appendix to 
this resolution with the exception of cases envisaged by the 
laws of the Kyrgyz Republic on customs tariffs and in line with 
the stipulations of agreements of the Government of the Kyrgyz 
Republic with foreign countries, companies, and international 
organizations. 
  Export customs duties should not be levied when the produce 
is delivered to those countries that have not adopted a decision 
on such duties or have abolished previous laws on this topic. 
The Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance charged with levying customs 
duties in accordance with the procedures stated by the ministry. 
Export and import customs duties should be paid before or at 
the moment of showing the goods to the customs. The Kyrgyz 
Ministry of Finance can grant the postponement of the payment of 
export duties for a term of up to 60 days from the moment of 
showing the goods under a bank's guarantee. Payment of duties 
for imported goods can be put off for a term of 30 days under a 
bank's guarantee or property collateral. If duties are not 
paid, goods will be confiscated. Tariff rates can be changed by 
the government under relevant circumstances. The government 
sets, cancels, or lifts tariffs at the recommendation of the 
duties and tariffs' council of the Kyrgyz Republic. Tariff 
allowances or preferences are granted only by the Government of 
the Kyrgyz Republic.

  [Text] Dushanbe January 8 TASS -- Tajik leader Imamali 
Rakhmanov has expressed concern over the intensified Afghan 
internal military and political conflicts in a letter sent on 
Friday to the U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. His 
concern is prompted by the fact that unrest in the neighbouring 
country has led to new aggravation of the situation on 
Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan. 
  The Tajik military point out that a new surge of tension on 
Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan is due to the deteriorating 
military and political situation in Afghanistan, where different 
groups are clashing also in the northern provinces bordering on 
Tajikistan. It is in these provinces that major Tajik armed 
opposition forces are concentrated. Taking advantage of the 
Afghan unrest, they have stepped up their own activity aimed at 
reaching their own ends. 
  According to military sources in Dushanbe, the current 
situation along parts of the border between Tajikistan and 
Afghanistan is increasingly tense because of such armed 
provocations by Tajik opposition forces acting from the Afghan 
territory. 
  Russian border guards early on Saturday suppressed one of 
the 
growing number of attempts by groups of opposition militants to 
cross the border from Afghanistan to Tajikistan towards Shaartuz 
in the Pyanj border guard detachment zone. 
  Military sources, however, say more attempts of this kind 
are 
likely to follow soon in the same zone. For this reason extra 
steps are being taken to prevent such attempts. Border troops 
are being reinforced in the area controlled by the 12th frontier 
post of the Moscow border guard detachment where armed 
provocations are on the rise too.

  [Text] Yesterday, heavy clashes took place in one of the 
posts in Shurobad Rayon, Kulyab Oblast. Military sources in the 
Islamic Rebirth Party of Tajikistan [words indistinct] report 
that as a result of these clashes, which continued for (?three 
hours), 17 government soldiers were killed and even more were 
wounded. (?One) armored vehicle and one GAZ-66 vehicle were 
destroyed. One person from among the mujahidin was also wounded. 
  The military sources of the Islamic Rebirth of Tajikistan 
have denied a report by the press office of the Border Forces of 
Russia to the effect that an armed group of the opposition was 
forced to turn back from the border. A (?statement) published 
by the military committee of the Islamic Rebirth Party of 
Tajikistan says that the mujahidin of the Islamic Rebirth Party 
of Tajikistan are functioning not along the borders but inside 
the territory of Tajikistan. [Words indistinct) the border 
guards have for some time now lost (?control) of the borders and 
movement across the borders was even easier than to enter the 
city of Tursunzoda.

  [Text] Dushanbe January 7 TASS -- Tajik opposition 
fighters, based in Afghanistan, have staged new provocations on 
some sectors of the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned today from military sources that a 
small gang of Tajik mojaheeds attempted on Thursday to break 
through the positions of Russian border guards, deployed on the 
Pyanj sector of the border, heading for Shartuz. However, they 
were stopped by Russian border guards and men from one of the 
battalions of the CIS peacekeeping force in Tajikistan and 
forced back into Afghanistan. 
  Futile also were the attempts of two small groups of Tajik 
opposition fighters to illegally cross into Tajikistan through 
the zone controlled by men of the 12th Russian border post. 
  According to the same source, Tajik mojaheeds, entrenched in 
several border provinces of the Islamic state of Afghanistan, 
have staged several more minor armed provocations since the 
beginning of January on sectors guarded by the Pyanj and 
Moskovskiy borderguard detachments. Two violators of the border 
were killed. There were no casualities among Russian servicemen.

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] At the recent meeting of the council of CIS defense 
ministers in Ashgabat, it was decided to extend the collective 
forces' operational period [in Tajikistan] by another year. 
Thus, our Russian soldiers will be there for another year. 
Here is the commander of the collective forces, Colonel General 
Boris Pyankov: 
  [Begin Pyankov recording] Unfortunately the situation 
remains difficult. Units, bandit formations, and groups, which 
penetrate into the territory of Tajikistan with hostile 
intentions, are making attempts to cross the state frontier 
almost continually. 
  The prime purpose of these attempts is reconnaissance, 
sabotage, and terrorism. And tension is arising as a result of 
these attempts. 
  There are also formations which have gone underground in 
Tajikistan, and I think that they are also, for the time being, 
not disposed toward keeping the peace. 
  The most important thing is that, along with the border 
guards, Tajikistan's national army, and units and elements of 
the Interior Ministry, the peacekeeping forces have taken steps 
to guarantee, as far as possible, peaceful conditions for 
constructive work in Tajikistan. [end recording]

  [Text] Estonian President Lennart Meri on Saturday approved 
some of the changes in the government proposed by Prime Minister 
Mart Laar. 
  Meri dismissed Maadis Uurike as finance minister and Trivimi 
Velliste as foreign minister, replacing the latter with Juri 
Luik, up till now defense minister. 
  Luik was born in Tallinn in 1966 and is a member of the 
Isamaa-Pro Patria Party, the largest in the present government 
coalition. A journalist by profession, he has been in the 
present government since December 1, 1992, having held the posts 
of minister without portfolio and defense minister. Luik also 
heads the Estonian delegation at current Estonian-Russian 
negotiations. 
  The post of defense minister has been given to Indrek 
Kannik, 
a member of parliament, born in Tallinn in 1961 and also a 
journalist by profession. Kannik is also a member of the 
Isamaa-Pro Patria Party. 
  However, the president turned down Laar's proposals to 
replace Toomas Sildmae with another member of parliament, Toivo 
Jurgenson, as economics minister and to appoint Heiki Kranich, 
also a member of parliament, finance minister. 
  For this reason, Government Press Secretary Ain Saarna has 
issued a statement accusing the president of violating the 
legislation. He said the head of state is authorized to appoint 
the prime minister alone but that the Constitution and the law 
on the government prohibit him from rejecting the government's 
proposals for the replacement of other ministers. The 
president's refusal to approve the appointment of some of the 
ministers means that "the renewal of the government will be 
postponed until the constitutional dispute is resolved by the 
chancellor of justice or, if necessary, by court," Saarna said. 
  He said the new ministers would not be sworn in and take 
office before the issue was resolved. 
  The press secretary quoted the prime minister as saying that 
the instability caused by the dispute might have negative 
consequences, especially with Estonia's present foreign-policy 
problems. 
  "The prime minister has reaffirmed that Estonia is a 
parliamentary, not a presidential republic," Saarna said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 8, BNS -- President Lennart Meri wants 
to have larger powers than what the Estonian Constitution 
provides grounds for, said Vello Saatpalu, the head of the 
parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission. 
  Saatpalu was commenting to BNS on the president's refusal to 
approve the nominations of the new ministers of finance and 
economics. 
  He called Meri's decision regrettable. 
  "Our country is on the route towards such a surrogate system 
of state government, where it will be soon no more clear if it 
is a parliamentary, presidential, or some third kind of a 
country," Saatpalu said. 
  He said the "customs" being introduced by the president had 
already long caused his bewilderment. 
  "Customs like this are at variance with the Estonian 
Constitution. I have pointed President Meri's attention to this 
already before. Several ambassadors of foreign countries have 
turned to me, because they find themselves unable to draw up the 
protocol for contacts with Estonia. They cannot understand what 
are the power limits of our president," he said. 
  He said Meri's way of acting with respect to the signing of 
agreements with other countries was "fully incomprehensible." 
  "Estonia belongs to the group of countries of the so-called 
Austrian line," he said. These are parliamentary countries, such 
as Germany, Austria, Iceland and Greece. The presidents of those 
countries never sign foreign agreements; this is being done by 
the prime ministers. President Meri, contrary to the spirit of 
our constitution, has signed agreements with France and Turkey," 
the head of the parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission said. 
  He said such conduct by the president might lead to problems 
with Russia in the future, when Estonia would have to sign an 
interstate treaty. 
  "What becomes if we told Russia that the treaty will be 
signed from the Estonian side by the prime minister? This would 
be absolutely impossible," Saatpalu said. He added that 
Germany's President Richard Weizsacker "would never do anything 
like this." 
  "Weizsacker would never sign any treaty, for instance, with 
Boris Yeltsin. But our president wants to do it himself," he 
said. 
  Saatpalu said the constitutional crisis in Estonia was 
expected not to affect the country's position, when the NATO 
Council meeting on Jan. 10-11 in Brussels starts discussing the 
issue of possible membership of the Baltics in the alliance. 
  He added that the crisis after all was Estonia's internal 
problem.

  [Text] A dispute over a government reshuffle has driven 
Estonia into a government crisis. According to Estonian radio, 
the government still lacks four key ministers. President 
Lennart Meri today appointed Juri Luik as the new foreign 
minister and Indrek Kannik as the defense minister. However, 
these two people refuse to take up their posts unless the 
president also ratifies the other changes of ministers proposed 
by Prime Minister Mart Laar. President Meri is not, however, 
willing to dismiss the current economics minister and will not 
ratify the prime minister's candidate for a new finance minister 
either. Prime Minister Laar is prepared to take the dispute as 
far as the constitutional court.

  [Text] Tallinn, January 9 -- Estonian President Lennart 
Meri has rejected parts of government reshuffle proposed by 
Prime Minister Mart Laar leaving key cabinet positions vacant. 
  Meri signed a decree on Saturday [8 January] replacing 
Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste with Juri Luik who has thus 
far held defence minister's portfolio. Under the same decree, 
Meri awarded defence minister's job to Indrek Kannik. He also 
dismissed Finance Minister Madis Uurike, but turned down Laar's 
nominee for the position leaving the post vacant. Meri also 
rejected Laar's proposal to dismiss Economics Minister Toomas 
Sildmae. 
  "Under the constitution of the Republic of Estonia, changes 
in the government lie within prime minister's jurisdiction while 
the president has no right to form the cabinet," the 
government's press office said. 
  President's legal advisor Vahur Glase replied telling ETA 
that the government's statement had not been correct and that 
under paragraph 90 in the constitution, changes in the 
government were to be made by the president after a proposal by 
the premier. Premier's proposal is of advisory, not compulsory 
nature, Glase added. 
  Laar also said in his statement he was prepared to take the 
matter to the legal chancellor and the constitutional court 
while ministers who had been appointed by Meri would not take 
office. 
  Consequently, Estonia has no foreign, defence or finance 
minister. 
  "This is a crisis on how to interpret the constitution and 
legislation and by no means a government crisis," government's 
spokesman Ain Saarna told ETA. 
  Laar expressed his regret over the situation saying 
instability in Estonia's domestic policy was not acceptable in 
the present situation. 
  Four nominated ministers -- Juri Luik, Toivo Jurgenson, 
Indrek Kannik and Heiki Kranich -- met Meri in his presidential 
palace Sunday evening. After the meeting, the situation 
remained unchanged. Luik and Kannik refused to take up their 
new positions and Meri refused to accept the package and appoint 
all four ministers. 
  Jurgenson was Laar's choice for economics minister and 
Kranich was his nominee for finance minister's position. 
  The current government reshuffle contains danger of crisis, 
but is not crisis, Environment Minister Andres Tarand said in 
his commentary to ETA while adding the situation was not 
dramatic. 
  "At the moment, we have a replacement system which is being 
used during ministers' foreign trips," Tarand said.

<F P=106> [From Office of the President official statement, 10 January </F>
POSTIMEES, p 1] 
  [Text] Monday, January 10 -- President Lennart Meri made a 
TV and radio statement Sunday [9 January] evening. The 
government reshuffle has run into difficulties, but there is no 
crisis, he stressed. The president described his actions as 
"usual in Germany, Austria or any other parliamentary state" and 
regretted that an internal crisis has broken out in Estonia. 
  President Meri announced that he had discussed a possible 
change of some ministers in September already, but the prime 
minister had not considered any changes necessary then. The 
local elections proved that the balance of power had changed and 
the prime minister did start preparations for a cabinet 
reshuffle. The president had recommended to postpone the 
changes until late February so as to consider the changing 
powers in Europe. The government failed to listen and the 
government restructuring regrettable coincided with major events 
in foreign politics. 
  The president further provided his interpretation of the 
constitution, explaining that while the prime minister presents 
the candidates, the president has the right to accept or reject 
them. 
  As for the background of the decision, the president 
stressed 
that the government's activities must be understood by the 
people and the Riigikogu [parliament]. However, the prime 
minister's assurances that Toomas Sildmae had lost the 
confidence of the government, was not borne out by statements of 
other cabinet members, President Meri stressed. Accepting all 
changes proposed by the prime minister would have been 
irresponsible, Meri declared in the statement. He further 
pointed out that the efficiency of the prime minister's 
decisions must be clear to the nation, the Riigikogu and the 
president. "When making any political decisions, we have to 
consider the state's interests first and subordinate them to any 
party interests," the presidential statement read. 
  The president concluded by appealing to the Riigikogu to 
contribute to the completion of the cabinet changes.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 07, BNS -- The main Russian combat 
unit still stationed in Estonia, the 144th armored infantry 
division, keeps on taking its equipment out of Estonia, 
officials at the Estonian Defense Ministry say. 
  According to information obtained by BNS, the division 
headquarters applied to Estonian authorities for 80 different 
transport permits in December. The division took a total of 96 
vehicles and 1,800 tons of property out of the country on 16 
railway trains last month. 
  The division hired 8 trains to take 57 vehicles and 2,800 
tons of property out from Estonia in November. 
  As much as 254 vehicles and 5,300 tons of army property were 
taken out of Estonia by the same unit on 42 trains in July. 
  The division, stationed in bases in Tallinn, as well as at 
Keila and Klooga to the west of the capital, was still about 
1,000-strong in December. 
  The division's tank regiment, stationed in Keila, until now 
comes for shooting exercise to Manniku on the outskirts of 
Tallinn. The division's ammunition depots at Klooga and Manniku 
contained about 3,500 tons of ammunition at the end of 1993.

  [Text] The Union of Russian Citizens held a meeting in 
Narva yesterday, calling for action against the "genocide 
policy" of the Estonian Government. Spokesman of the Union 
Vladimir Yefimov invited the persons attending to use all means 
against the Estonian authorities, including civic disobedience. 
A letter will be sent to the UN and the CE [Council of Europe], 
he announced, adding that a major meeting in central Narva is 
intended for January. 
  The unemployed held a meeting in Jaanilinn (Ivangorod) 
yesterday, demanding that all inhabitants of Narva be dismissed 
from the enterprises in Jaanilinn and the jobs provided for the 
locals. Approximately 15 hundred of those present had been 
dismissed from the firms in Narva as a number of major 
enterprises cut jobs late last year. Mayor of Jaanilinn Viktor 
Dmitriyev announced that the Russian laws would not allow such a 
move.

<F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Zheludkov and Aleksey Chelnokov: </F>
"Visitors to the Capital From Ukraine and Belarus Offer Good 
Bargains"] 
  [Text] Many of Moscow's streets and squares, especially 
those near stations, markets, and subways, have been taken over 
by citizens from Ukraine and Belarus. They trade in everything 
they can manage to carry out of their "coupon-economy" and 
"counter-economy" states. The Russian ruble, only recently 
dubbed "the wooden currency," has suddenly become an object of 
passionate desire for citizens of the former Union republics. 
For the sake of acquiring the ruble thousands of people are 
giving up their homes and families, going without sleep for days 
on end, and standing for days in the winter mud of Moscow's 
streets.... 
<H5>  A Cosy Breeding Ground for Crime... </H5>
  The Tashinka market has its own laws which effectively 
conform not at all to the generally accepted laws, and no one 
here is worried about concepts such as licensing, quality 
control, and health norms. Only Muscovites for whom prices at 
central stores are too dear now come to the dilapidated market; 
vendors are divided into two categories -- dealers in old rags 
and nails and sellers of food. 
  The first category of trade "workers" are of interest to no 
one except scrap metal merchants. But the second, dubbed "the 
Belarusian trade mafia" in the neighboring homesteads, are of 
interest to everyone. To exact a tribute from a Belarusian who 
has arrived in Tashinka Square is as easy as picking up money 
off the street -- only the lazy or very scrupulous do not do it. 
  The first to rush to the ranks of traders are 
representatives 
of the market administration -- the janitors. In return for 
2,000 rubles [R] they give the vendors something like a little 
table or market stall and an oral guarantee of freedom to trade 
within the perimeter of Tashinka Square. There are no visiting 
traders in the market itself -- their potential customers hardly 
go there at all. But here they sell almost everything in which 
fraternal Belarus abounds: soap, brassieres, milk, cottage 
cheese, soda, cranberries, meat, cured fish, and even beer from 
the bottle -- at R100 per glass. They can even pour you a drop 
of vodka. 
  Prices on Tashinka Square are indeed low: Boiled ham goes 
for R1,500-R2,000. Smoked meat sells for between R3,000 and 
R4,000. Smoked ham goes for around R4,000, and lightly smoked 
ham for R3,000 per kilogram. Cranberries and apples cost R1,200 
and R1,300 respectively. Soda, which is not to be found in 
Moscow, costs R250 a packet. Children's soap sells for R75, 
whereas the state food store in the neighborhood sells only 
"Camay" at 10 times the price. 
  Despite fears, no incidents of food poisoning from goods 
from 
Belarus or the pharmaceutical preparations which sell abundantly 
here were recorded over the past year in Krasnopresnenskiy 
Rayon. True, the traders here bring product quality to mind only 
when the local health and epidemological monitoring service puts 
in an appearance, but that is not more than once a month. Hence 
to the question "Where does this meat or cheese come from?" the 
traders usually answer: "From Brest." But this is only for 
those who recall that half of Belarus' oblasts have been 
contaminated by Chernobyl. For those who can only afford to buy 
"poshekhonskiy" cheese [low-quality provincial cheese] here at 
R2,500 instead of "Suluguni" -- R1,500 dearer in the state trade 
network -- this is not a question of fundamental importance. 
  A different kind of quality control appear on Tashinka 
Square from 1000 hours -- officers of the militia's 88th 
department. The guardians of order walk in twos and regularly 
check documents, something that is especially topical following 
the restrictions introduced by the capital's mayor on foreigners 
from the former republics entering and residing in the city. 
The militia officers have trained eyes, and both sergeants 
skirted past an old man dealing in cranberries; but they at once 
became interested in two women selling walnuts. The brassiere 
dealers did not escape their attention either. The militia 
officer aptly dubbed the contents of the bags "Chernobyl 
umbrellas." And for some reason he took R4,000. "That is their 
tax," the traders explained to me. "They don't issue receipts." 
  The third set of "controllers" of the square's bazaar were 
Azerbaijani kids who flocked from the market gates. "These kids 
take money on a fair basis: How much each man can afford," the 
old man with the cranberries says, whether in jest or in 
earnest. Probably a sense of justice has indeed developed among 
racketeers, because yet again nothing was taken from the old 
man. "I got nothing," as the old man himself said in Ukrainian. 
On the other hand the brassiere sellers once again had to cough 
up "5 grand" and unhappily started to gather up their wares. 
  Traders from Belarus frequently come in order to buy cheap 
audio and visual equipment in Russia with their hard-earned 
rubles. They stay with friends and relatives. They are 
convinced that "it is more profitable to work in Russia today 
than in Poland." 
  The second group of traders are those for whom it is more 
profitable to "work" in Poland, but more convenient to sell in 
Russia. In their native Belarus they earn less from brassieres, 
and the taxes there, it seems, are higher. And the third group 
-- the largest -- are people stopping off in Moscow on their way 
to visit relatives in the Russian heartlands, or in countries of 
the former republics. For them Moscow is the place to convert 
their native "counters" into a more stable currency. This kind 
of trader finds out about Tashinka Square accidentally, from 
friends, or even at Belorusskiy Station, where they spend the 
night for free and live for several days. 
  On the whole, the militia's 88th department told me, 
Tashinka 
Square is "a cosy breeding ground for crime." 
<H5>  Six Pay Packets for Four Trips </H5>
  Every morning an avalanche of speculators with heavy bags 
descends from the trains arriving at Moscow's Kiev Railway 
Station. Having negotiated the barriers at the doors and 
turnstiles they rapidly disperse among the capital's flea 
markets. But the bulk of them stop in the immediate vicinity of 
the station -- at the Dorogomilovskiy market. 
  Just as at Tashinka, the enterprising citizens from the 
coupon-economy state are not allowed underneath the arched vault 
of the market. Here citizens of Azerbaijan trading in tropical 
fruits have long since firmly established themselves. Hence, 
despite the rules on trade, for several hours a day Kievskaya 
Ulitsa is transformed into a huge flea market. 
  The Christmas vacation, we discovered, does not extend to 
the 
private sector. Thousands of street traders, mixing Russian and 
Ukrainian words, were vying with one another in extolling their 
wares. Squeezing my way through the crowd with difficulty and, 
so as to avoid trouble, clutching my bag closely, I looked over 
the range of goods available. It was inexhaustible: women's 
blouses embroidered with glass beads, large axes, peacock 
feathers, bodices, sausage meat, pickles, preserves, and so on 
and so forth. All this magnificence lay strewn not very 
esthetically on bushes beside the road or was piled high in 
dirty boxes. But still more amazing were the prices -- 
two-thirds to one-half the Moscow average. 
  The customer in this flea market also has his own character. 
They are people who as a rule are poorly dressed; many are 
elderly. "Aren't you afraid of being poisoned?" we asked a 
woman for whom a guy in a greasy quilted jacket was fetching a 
"stick" of sausage meat from his rucksack. "What do you mean," 
she replies, "I have been buying from him for a long time. 
Excellent Ukrainian sausage meat, for which in a store you pay 
not R2,000, like here, but R4,000-6,000." 
  The sausage meat seller is from near Chernigovo. He works in 
a cooperative, but he makes up the bulk of his family budget, in 
his own words, through shuttle trips to Russia. 
  "For four trips to Moscow I get six monthly pay packets," 
he says. "The coupon is now 35-40 times more `lightweight' than 
the ruble. One trip -- 40 kilograms of lightly smoked sausage 
meat. This is snatched up within three hours; I change the 
rubles for coupons, or else I buy goods here to sell at home." 
  "But surely the goods are confiscated by Ukrainian customs 
officials?" 
  "Of course not, pal -- we give them all a little extra to 
keep them sweet! And if some crank takes the rucksack -- it's 
no big loss: I return home for another consignment of sausage 
meat." 
  The mechanics of the flea market are elementary: The dealer, 
arriving in the capital at, say, 0800, has already gotten rid of 
his wares by midday. Two-three hours are spend on the purchase 
of consignments of imported cigarettes or chocolate from small 
wholesalers (on the square by the station the wholesale market 
is the cheapest in Moscow). And later on the same day the 
evening train carries the breadwinner back to his native peasant 
house. 
  "You force down prices on the Moscow markets" -- we are 
talking to the same trader. "Haven't your competitors tried to 
punish you for this?" 
  "There has been no such incident in my time. The problem 
lies elsewhere: Often some boys `call round' and demand money 
for the space. We pay them R4,000-5,000 a time. All the same 
we do not go away with empty pockets." 
  The customer and the trader at the local flea market, all 
the 
indications suggest, are entirely happy with one another. But 
at the 123d militia department they believe that the spontaneous 
congregation of thousands of people in this area creates a 
dangerous breeding ground for crime. Pickpockets, muggers, and 
small-time racketeers gather here like flies around honey. It 
is very difficult to combat them, because regulars to the 
market, preferring "not to get involved," refuse to complain to 
the militia. 
  "All we can do is curse under our breath," Oleg Sharov, 
deputy chief of the militia's 123d department, says. 
"Nevertheless, in the last six months we have caught 150 
pickpockets and roughly the same number of muggers at the 
market. But, of course, this is just a drop in the ocean." 
  Sharov calls his detectives "the paperwork brigade": They 
barely have time to fill out their official reports. Some days 
the number of detainees reaches hundreds! Yet aside from the 
market, they have to watch over order on the square in the 
station precincts. Four criminal groups keep tabs on the 
commercial kiosks on this square, and they are repeatedly 
organizing bloody affrays between one another. 
  Sooner or later the patience of the militia or the health 
and 
epidemological station will snap. The Ukrainian traders will be 
arrested and fined, and then they will move to Tashinka Square 
-- which is where we began this report....

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 10 ITAR-TASS -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
carries an article of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's press 
secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov who discusses some of the pressing 
issues of Russian political life. Touching on the defeat of the 
democratic forces in the parliamentary elections on December 12 
Kostikov says, "one of the root causes of the failure of the 
democrats in the elections is that neither their parties nor 
their leaders have a taste or skills for conducting routine work 
for the sake of true values for the state and the people." The 
aim of the electoral campaign was not to promote ideas capable 
of normalising Russia but "winning a deputy mandate and reaping 
the interest on the success. The programme of none of the 
electoral coalitions contained even a hint at the ways in which 
national and not inner party or group problems will be tackled". 
  Explaining why the country needs a trial of the August 1991 
coup plotters and of the totalitarian ideology as a whole 
Kostikov writes: "Millions of people who suffered enough from 
the omnipotence of the communist party of the Soviet Union will 
only believe that the suppressed rebellion (in October 1993) 
liberated us from the threat of communist restoration if the 
admirers of the red-and-brown sauce, sickles, hammers and 
swastikas have a firm and clear indication of their place in 
society". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI lead with a report about the opening of 
the 
Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on Tuesday. "This day 
will open a new political year. Because everything that happened 
between the elections and this day is no more than an 
anticipation, a presentiment and guesswork". 
  Explaining why the bulk of the voters cast their ballots in 
favour of the opposition electoral coalitions, the newspaper 
notes that most people "voted for those who was active. There is 
nothing can be done because we still believe in the strength of 
speeches, convincingly sounding pronouncements and propaganda 
push." Along with this, the newspaper writes, it would be 
erroneous to think that the considerable number of voters who 
favoured the communists, the agrarians close to the former and 
especially the liberal democrats personifies radical left or 
right wing public sentiments, although such sentiments 
undoubtedly exist. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI see as a good sign the fact that even the 
oppositional coalition leaders seek to convince the public that 
they "are going to the parliament not to make war but to work 
constructively". The confrontational political style, or at 
least its rhetoric, is no longer in fashion, the newspaper 
concludes. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) writes that there are more 
questions than answers on the eve of the opening of the Federal 
Assembly. The newspaper adds that only one parliament group -- 
that of the deputies from the communist party of the Russian 
Federation -- gathered in the parliamentary centre on January 9. 
  The same newspaper comments on the presidential decree 
(dated 
December 22, 1993), which endorsed the regulation for the 
federal civil service. It says this system of state power has 
existed in Russia for centuries but was forgotten in recent 
years. Civil servants of all ranks are known to present-day 
Russians from historical tales and fiction.

  [Text] The president of Estonia, Lennart Meri, has called 
upon NATO not to react to the warnings of the Russian president. 
If NATO wants to survive it must prove that it is Manfred 
Woerner, not Boris Yeltsin, who holds the NATO council, the 
Baltic News Service quotes the Estonian president. In Lennart 
Meri's opinion the Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas 
acted very correctly in making an official request for Lithuania 
to be admitted to NATO. According to the Estonian president, 
there is a vacuum of security in the Baltic states at present, 
and certain forces in Russia may be tempted to fill it.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 07, BNS -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher expects the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels 
to make decisions on the establishment of essentially new 
cooperation between the alliance and East European countries. 
  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys received a letter 
from Christopher this week, saying the Brussels summit would be 
a favorable possibility to start closer security cooperation 
between the alliance and the newly emerging democracies in 
Eastern Europe, including Lithuania, the Lithuanian Foreign 
Ministry said. 
  Christopher said the summit is likely announce that NATO 
will 
welcome new members in the future. The alliance's evolutionary 
expansion would preserve its strength, harmony among its members 
and its ability to act. 
  The secretary of state said the Partnership for Peace 
program 
offers Lithuania close practical cooperation with both military 
and political structures of NATO. The initiative would require 
serious military and political steps -- to observe international 
obligations, to guarantee civil control of the armed forces and 
to properly arrange the military budget. 
  Christopher expressed hope that Lithuania will support the 
Partnership for Peace program and will take an active part in it.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 07, BNS -- Estonia and Latvia were 
informed in advance about Lithuania's intentions to officially 
ask for NATO membership, said Lithuanian Foreign Minister 
Povilas Gylys. 
  In an interview with the leftist TIESA newspaper, Gylys said 
the reaction of the two Baltic neighbors was slightly different 
because Estonia is more reserved about Lithuania's step. 
Apparently, the Lithuanian minister gave the interview before 
Estonian President Lennart Meri's view on the matter was made 
public. 
  Gylys said "although we maintained close relations with 
NATO, 
our desire was unexpected to many." 
  The minister said Lithuania's request for NATO membership is 
based on national security interests and is not directed against 
anybody. "We move toward an era of politics without 
confrontation." 
  In Gylys opinion, rapprochement with the alliance is an 
evolutionary process, while Lithuania's move might only speed it 
up. "This depends not only on Lithuania."

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Today's news conference in the 
Seimas held by Seimas Deputy Chairman Aloyzas Sakalas focused 
its attention on foreign policy and international relations. 
[passage omitted] I asked him to describe our foreign policy 
  [Begin Sakalas recording] Lithuania's foreign policy must be 
based on some main principles. There must be a foreign policy 
concept containing some main principles. [passage omitted] 
Unfortunately, I do not at present see such a concept in our 
foreign policy based on principles. These principles should be 
as follows: Relations with the closest neighbors, relations with 
other countries. 
  In relations with the closest neighbors I would put in the 
first place relations with Russia. Russia, as is known, has 
taken over the rights of the former USSR, it has only taken over 
the rights of the former USSR. If only rights, then why not 
responsibilities, too? And if responsibilities, then such 
issues as compensation and others may be discussed. If it has 
taken over rights only, then on what basis? So much about 
relations with Russia. In addition, we must evaluate the 
Russian military doctrine that has been published and is well 
known. We must respond correspondingly to this doctrine. There 
has been no such response so far. [passage omitted] We must 
evaluate this doctrine. [passage omitted] We must support all 
democratic forces in Russia and evaluate statements by the 
Liberal Democratic Party. We have not done this so far. 
  When we have all such criteria, our evaluations, we will be 
able to conduct our diplomacy in relations with Russia. 
  As for other neighbors, for instance Poland, are concerned, 
we have no treaty with Poland, we have no treaty with Belarus. 
[passage omitted] We must evaluate on what basis we are prepared 
to sign a treaty with Belarus. [passage omitted] The trouble 
with Poland is the Zeligowski action and the Suwalki Treaty that 
was broken, and it seems to me that we must say whether we 
adhere or refuse [as heard], but there must be a decision, and 
not like it is now -- diplomats travel to Poland and back and 
there is no order. Either we firmly say that until this is 
evaluated we do not intend to sign the treaty, or give up some 
things and sign a treaty that does not mention history and deals 
with the present only. 
  As far as Germany is concerned, there are many people who 
have suffered from the Nazis, were deported to Germany and were 
lost there. The Bundestag is examining the issues of 
compensation and we should say something and not wait for 
something to happen. 
  And lastly, Latvia and Estonia. Either we integrate in a 
common economic zone with some common political obligations, or 
each country remains separately. We must think about this. 
[passage omitted] 
  We must not find ourselves under the influence of a single 
foreign state. [passage omitted] It must not happen that 60 
percent our economy is linked with some specific country that 
can later dictate its economic and political conditions. 
[passage omitted] 
  I do not think our statement on joining NATO will result in 
a 
positive decision. I think that there has to be an additional 
incentive for the West to think, as soon as possible, about the 
possibility of admitting us to NATO, but not yet as the solution 
of such possibility. [sentence as heard] [end recording]

  [Text] Despite the conspicuous failures and considerable 
loss in men and material on the fronts in recent days, the 
Azerbaijani authorities are adamantly continuing to put out 
disinformation about alleged advances by the Azerbaijani 
National Army. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters 
reports that in fact the Azerbaijani National Army's renewed 
large-scale offensive along the Karabakh-Azerbaijan conflict 
line has again failed. According to preliminary reports, 
Karabakh Army units basically maintained their defensive 
positions during fighting which has been taking place all along 
the front line since the early hours of 7 January, and in 
certain sectors they even launched counterattacks and ousted the 
enemy from the captured positions. There are dead and injured on 
both sides. Casualty figures are being determined, but the 
losses suffered by Azerbaijani side are several times greater.

  [Text] Today, the Azerbaijani Army units again disrupted 
the peace on Armenia's border. Armenian Defense Ministry press 
service reported that there was intense enemy howitzer fire at 
the defensive positions around Vahan in Krasnoselskiy Rayon at 
about 1000. The Armenian side did not retaliate. There were no 
casualties on our side. No other incidents have taken place 
along the rest of the border since last night. 
  Fierce battles are continuing along almost the entire 
Karabakh confrontation line. Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense 
Army press service reported that though the Azerbaijanis have 
made certain insignificant advances, the Karabakh troops are 
managing to halt enemy attacks in some sectors of the front. 
The enemy is trying at all costs to break through the Armenian 
defensive lines at some point, and is therefore launching 
attacks and sustaining heavy losses. Nearly 3,000 Azerbaijani 
troops and officers have been killed during the incessant 
battles since 18 December. More than 70 fighters were killed on 
the Karabakh side during that same period. 
  The Azerbaijanis launched attacks in the eastern and 
southern 
sectors of the front this morning, but Armenian forces are 
repulsing them.

  [Excerpt] Yerevan, Jan 9 (AFP)--The Azerbaijani Army 
launched a major two-pronged offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh on 
Sunday, as fighting continued around the Armenian-controlled 
town of Agdam, the enclave's separatist army headquarters said. 
  The Azerbaijani forces, backed by armoured vehicles, were 
heading toward Mardekert in northern Nagorno-Karabakh and toward 
Askeran in the east, some 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the 
capital Stepanakert, the army headquarters said. 
  Heavy fighting was also continuing around Agdam, a strategic 
Azerbaijani town two kilometres east of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
border, which was captured by Armenian separatists six months 
ago. 
  The Stepanakert headquarters confirmed that Goradiz, a key 
town near the Iranian-Azerbaijani border, had been recaptured by 
the Azerbaijani Army. 
  But it denied Baku's claim Saturday that Azerbaijan 
controlled the road linking Goradiz and Fizuli, on the southern 
border of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  The Armenian separatists had "succeeded in halting the 
Azerbaijani offensive" in that area, the headquarters said.

following information on 7 January. Despite sustaining crushing 
blows in various sectors of the front in recent days, the 
Armenian Armed Forces are not giving up their occupationist 
plans, and are trying to breach the defensive positions of the 
Azerbaijani Army. Their efforts in this direction are being 
brought to naught thanks to the gallantry of our fighters; and 
the enemy is retreating, while sustaining enormous losses. 
  Our brave fighters destroyed more than 200 enemy troops and 
more than 50 armored vehicles in fighting today. The fleeing 
Armenians, who were chased out of the positions they had 
previously occupied, are leaving behind considerable amounts of 
military hardware and provisions. The gallant Azerbaijani Army 
once again showed its strength to the enemy.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev has received 
commander of the Group of Russian Forces in Transcaucasus 
Lieutenant General Fedor Reut, on a working visit in Baku. 
  In the course of their conversation the parties discussed 
issues related to regulation of transport communications' 
functioning in Transcaucasia and, in particular, in Azerbaijan. 
  Aliyev pointed out that aggression being waged by Armenia 
against the republic seriously affects normal functioning of 
transport and energy communications in Azerbaijan. 
  The president reported that at present almost the whole 
section of the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia is a 
battlefield and it is very difficult to restore normal 
functioning of the communications in this zone. 
  Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Cabinet of Ministers told Interfax 
that Baku had declined a proposal to organize a meeting of 
Transcaucasian states' vice premiers on the border of three 
countries to discuss security of the gas-main laid via Georgia's 
territory to Armenia. In 1993 this gas-main was subjected to 
numerous explosions on the territory of Georgia's Marneul region 
which is predominantly inhabited by the Azerbaijanis. The last 
explosion occurred on December 18. 
  Azerbaijan explained its rejection to participate in this 
meeting by the fact that it has nothing to do with these 
subversive acts.

  [Text] Azerbaijan's leaders have reiterated their view that 
a peaceful solution must be found to end the war between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan and called for the Armenian Armed Forces' 
immediate and unconditional withdrawal from the areas they have 
occupied. President Aliyev outlined this when he received 
Colonel General Fedor Reut, commander of the Transcaucasian 
group of Russia's troops, at his request on 6 January. 
  President Aliyev said the illusions of Armenia's extremist 
circles, which believe the occupationist forces will remain in 
the territory they have occupied in Azerbaijan indefinitely, are 
meaningless. He asserted: Azerbaijan can and will safeguard 
its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the nonviolation of 
its border. But we believe the dispute, which has continued for 
nearly six years, is meaningless. So, we call for obstructing 
unnecessary bloodshed and killing. 
  President Aliyev also asserted: CIS resources must be used 
to achieve that; the organization was not established just to 
solve economic problems. It also has political and military 
responsibilities. We have signed the agreement on collective 
security. The CIS must not remain inactive in the face of 
aggression by one member against another. On behalf of 
Azerbaijan, which is a sovereign republic, I brought the issue 
to the attention of the participants at the Ashgabat summit. As 
the commander of Russia's troops in the Transcaucasus, you must 
contribute to the effort to halt Armenia's continuing aggression 
against Azerbaijan. 
  Geydar Aliyev said: Russia has military bases and units 
under your command in Georgia and Armenia. Many of our kin live 
miserably in several rayons in Georgia. We have received 
serious information that they are being unjustly treated. We 
have held talks with Georgia's leaders. A great tragedy may 
emerge if the negative developments are not stopped. The 
incidents in Karabakh confirm that. Stability must be 
established in the region at all costs. 
  According to President Aliyev, Russia's military units in 
the 
Transcaucasus and Russia must play a significant role in 
arranging relations among the republics in the Transcaucasus. 
He said: The [word indistinct] of Russia's troops in Armenia 
has a military status. Azerbaijan and Russia are members of the 
same alliance. We are independent countries. I have the legal 
and moral right to make my request. I wish to unofficially 
stress that Azerbaijan's leaders have received information that 
Russia's military units in Armenia have helped that republic's 
military forces in various ways. But considering our friendly 
relations with Russia, Azerbaijan will spare no effort to 
facilitate the transit of freight through our republic for 
Russia's military forces in Armenia. Information we have 
received that the freight, fuel in particular, is falling into 
the hands of the Armenian military forces makes us very uneasy. 
  Gen. Reut described his talks with Aliyev as a very 
important 
development. He said Russia's political and military leaders 
support the effort to find a peaceful solution to the dispute 
between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Without directly referring to 
the points raised by Aliyev, Gen. Reut said the dispute in the 
region has made everyone, including Russia's military forces, 
very uneasy. He said that they too are forced to live under 
conditions of war. Gen. Reut stressed that he has arrived in 
Azerbaijan to ask the Republic's leaders to facilitate the 
uninterrupted transit of military echelons [last word in 
English] travelling to Armenia through Baku. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov and Defense Minister 
Mamed Rafi Mamedov attended the meeting.

  [Text] [Announcer Sergey Vozyanov] Colonel General Fedor 
Reut, the commander of the Group of Russian Forces in the 
Transcaucasus, is continuing his visit to Azerbaijan. He has 
had a meeting with Geydar Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan. 
Aliyev noted that active fighting is in progress at the moment, 
but it was not initiated by the Azerbaijani side. For a month 
now, he said, plans are being hatched for the annexation of 
further Azerbaijani land. Addressing Fedor Reut, the president 
called on the Russian side to promote a peaceful settlement of 
the question of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Aliyev also 
asked for help in defending the 600,000-strong Azerbaijani 
community in Georgia, which is being subjected to attack by 
criminal elements. That was a report from the ANI news agency.

  [Text] Georgia's leader Eduard Shevardnadze has no 
objection to the possibility of ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia 
being buried in Tbilisi; but he is of the view that the Georgian 
people will be against it, Interfax learned today from a 
highly-placed official in Chechnya's foreign ministry who has 
been in the Georgian capital as part of a republican delegation. 
At meanwhile, an enquiry group from Georgia, which has arrived 
in the west of the republic, has not yet found any evidence to 
confirm allegations that Zviad Gamsakhurdia committed suicide or 
was murdered.

  [Text] Groznyy, 8 Jan -- An IBERIA correspondent learned 
that Manana Archvadze, the wife of Georgia's former president, 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia, said in a conversation with journalists that 
she had spoken with the men who had personally witnessed how 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia had ended his life by committing a suicide. 
  "However sad it may be, we have a 100% proof of this fact", 
said Manana Archvadze-Gamsakhurdia. 
  According to her, the body of the deceased is in a secure 
place and she is waiting for the right moment which will make it 
possible to bury Zviad Gamsakhurdia's corpse in Groznyy. 
  Manana Archvadze refused to meet the representatives of 
Georgia's law enforcement bodies as, according to her, they 
would force her to hand over Zviad Gamsakhurdia's corpse for an 
examination; the results of which, Eduard Shevardnadze would use 
to his own advantage.

  [Text] A team of criminal investigators working in Groznyy, 
capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, has come to the 
conclusion that deposed Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia 
died on Georgian territory, said the head of the team, Zurab 
Dzhordzhikia. 
  According to his widow, the ex-president shot himself in 
western Georgia on December 31. 
  Dzhordzhikia, senior assistant to Georgia's prosecutor 
general, told INTERFAX no evidence had been found to prove the 
reports that Gamsakhurdia had been wounded in Chechnya. 
  Dzhordzhikia said two witnesses of Gamsakhurdia's death had 
been found. One of them is in Chechnya, but it has been 
impossible to contact him, for Gamsakhurdia's family, living in 
Groznyy, objects to this, Dzhordzhikia said. 
  He said President Dzhokhar Dudayev of Chechnya had given a 
"good and friendly" reception to the Georgian investigators. 
The latter, who include staff from the Prosecutor General's 
Office and the Interior and Security Ministries, had an 
hour-and-a-half-long meeting with Dudayev, who promised them 
whatever help they might need, Dzhordzhikia said. 
  The investigators also met Merab Kiknadze, a member of the 
former Georgian parliament, who said the Gamsakhurdia family 
objected to a post mortem. 
  It is still unknown where the ex-president is buried, but 
the 
Tbilisi team has had a letter from his widow, Manana 
Gamsakhurdia, who, "on behalf of the whole family of the 
deceased president," asks for his body to be buried in Chechnya, 
"where his family has lived in exile for the past two years." 
She has made the same request to Dudayev.

  [Text] Groznyy, 8 Jan -- An aide to Chechnya's president 
yesterday told an IBERIA correspondent in a telephone 
conversation that Zviad Gamsakhurdia's wife, Manana Archvadze 
appealed to the Chechen government to act as a mediator with the 
Georgian government in clarifying the matters connected with the 
death of Georgia's former president. 
  Dzhokhar Dudayev's aide also said that Chechnya's president 
had agreed that independent experts are participating in the 
clarification of the above-mentioned matter which Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia's wife, Manana Archvadze, assesses negatively. 
  It was noted during the conversation that the Chechen 
government had consented to Manana Archvadze's wish that the 
former president be buried in Chechnya. 
  The representatives of the Georgian procurator's office are 
currently visiting Chechnya where they met Dudayev in connection 
with the above-mentioned matter.

  [Text] Our correspondent today met the vice premier of 
Georgia, Irakli Menagharishvili. 
  [Begin recording] [Menagharishvili] The Georgian authorities 
did everything in their power in order to establish the truth. 
You know that a special investigatory group has been sent to 
Samegrelo region, west Georgia, and another investigatory group 
comprising the representatives of the prosecutor's office, and 
the Security and Interior Ministries has left together with the 
representatives of the Chechen authorities for Groznyy. They 
tried there to meet the witness who, according to the Chechen 
authorities, had witnessed the fact of Gamsakhurdia's death. 
Unfortunately, this meeting did not take place and the witness 
has not said yet where the former president is buried. 
  Our representatives in Chechnya learned only that Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia's corpse had been buried in a mountainous zone of 
Samegrelo, approximately in the rayon which is still being 
controlled by one of the armed groups of his supporters, 
therefore, the authorities do not yet have a possibility to 
establish the truth by going to the scene. 
  The official version about the alleged besieging of the 
former president and his suicide is doubtful to us as during the 
recent weeks no combat or search operations for finding him have 
taken place and accordingly, this statement raises serious 
doubts. 
  The demands which our authorities put to the supporters of 
the former president are that the supporters officially legalize 
the burial place of the deceased so that the official 
authorities have a possibility to establish the truth -- what 
had happened, and the relevant examination be carried out 
followed by a traditionally accepted routine. 
  Unfortunately, we have not yet received a positive answer to 
all these demands and therefore, we have no possibility to tell 
the public more details. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] If the Georgian authorities in 
the long run get a positive answer to this demand, and if all 
these doubts are confirmed, where will Georgia's former 
president be buried? 
  [Menagharishvili] It has already been officially announced 
that we are unanimous in thinking that the burial place of the 
former president, whether he is buried in Tbilisi or somewhere 
else, must be chosen solely by his family. It has always been a 
tradition in our society and nobody is going to break this rule. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] Based on Irakli Menagharishvili's words, we 
shall 
add that in case of a necessity, the Georgian authorities 
undertake the responsibility of reburying the corpse, provided 
that a qualified forensic examination is carried out and that 
every interested party as well as foreign experts are given a 
possibility to take part in the examination.

  [Text] Aleksandr Kavsadze, Chairman of the Georgian Ethnic 
Relations and Human Rights Committee, said that the Georgian 
delegation has a package of peace proposals for the 
Georgian-Abkhazian talks that are scheduled to be held in Geneva 
on January 11. 
  Kavsadze, who is a member of the Georgian delegation, told 
Interfax that the return of refugees to Abkhazia rather than the 
political structure of that republic would dominate the talks. 
"Abkhazia's autonomy is not questioned. It is the shape of its 
statehood that will be discussed by the Georgian Constitutional 
Commission and the whole people of the republic," he said. 
  On the other hand, he continued, the Georgian delegation can 
expect anything in Geneva even though UN, CSCE and Russian 
officials who will attend the talks want the conflict to be 
resolved by political means. 
  In his words, if the talks are impassed, "we will have to 
protect the national interests by force. We have the right to 
do this because the conflict in Abkhazia is an internal affair." 
Kavsadze placed the blame for the possible failure of the talks 
squarely on the Abkhazian authorities. 
  He did not agree that Georgia would be in the position of a 
country which lost the war at the talks. He said that "there 
will be no winners or losers in this war" because "both 
Georgians and Abkhazians lost it, for this is a war within a 
country." 
  The Georgian negotiators in Geneva will be headed by 
Chairman 
of the Emergency Committee Jaba Ioseliani and the Abkhazian 
negotiators, by Prime Minister Sokrat Jinjoliya.

  [Text] The second round of talks on the peaceful settlement 
of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict will be held in Geneva on 11 
January. In this connection, Aleksandre Kavsadze, chairman of 
the Georgian committee for inter-ethnic relations and human 
rights, has stated that Georgia is opposed to the examination of 
the future state system of Abkhazia at the Geneva talks. He 
said that the state system of Abkhazia is Georgia's internal 
problem and that it is now being examined by the republic's 
Constitutional Commission. 
  Mr. Kavsadze believes that the subject of the Geneva talks 
should be the future of the Georgian refugees who left Abkhazia 
last year.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] For several days the Georgians have been 
preoccupied with two sensational news stories: first is the 
death of Gamsakhurdia, and the second, even more powerful, is 
that, according to rumors, 25,000 Russian troops have been 
brought into Georgia and are stationed in Tbilisi, near the 
Vaziani military airfield. To be honest, the people are more 
interested in Gamsakhurdia's suicide. [passage omitted] 
  As for the introduction of 25,000 Russian soldiers, the best 
informed person -- Georgia's Security Minister Igor Georgadze -- 
has given us an answer to this question: 
  [Georgadze] As for 25,000 Russian soldiers being stationed 
on 
Georgian territory, I can tell you with full responsibility that 
this does not correspond to reality. 
  [Correspondent] Georgia's Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze 
was simply shocked by this question. He said the following: 
  [Shevardnadze] Rumors are being circulated abroad that order 
is being poorly maintained in Tbilisi, and so why don't we call 
in the Russians and get them to organize a normal life for us? 
I think this is simply farcical. [Video shows correspondent 
reporting from Tbilisi, officials being interviewed]

television viewers and Supreme Council deputies on the occasion 
of Christmas from the studio in Tbilisi on 9 January--recorded] 
  [Text] Dear television viewers, Merry Christmas and a Happy 
New Year! I wish you joy and happiness. As you know, our 
parliament will not resume its work until 18 January, and there 
are some acute, pressing issues that have to be discussed by 
both the deputies and the public as a whole. Therefore, let me 
address you and the members of the Georgian parliament with a 
short speech. 
  Dear colleagues, friends. Merry Christmas and a Happy New 
Year. I wish you happiness, together with Georgia. If Georgia 
is not happy, then God forbid our happiness. 
  We have lived several months through an illusion reminiscent 
of a temporary mitigation of acute pain through the use of 
painkillers. The war with the invaders has stopped by our 
joining the CIS. A definite chance for our survival has 
emerged. We must use every minute, but we are still slow. Once 
again, we are facing the danger of physical self-destruction, 
and we are watching with folded arms how intense Cain-like 
actions are becoming. There still is the fear: What if we lose 
the title of a patriot? What if I do not come across as a good 
man? 
  The question is whether the country and the people are going 
to survive. It is a question of life and death. All of us have 
forgotten that we are living in an age of technical 
civilization, when the global danger of destruction is greater 
than ever before. If a long time used to be needed to destroy a 
country, now it requires only a matter of hours. I do not mean 
a weapon of mass destruction. 
  Georgia has lost thousands of lives in recent years. We have 
over 200,000 refugees. Georgia has suffered huge financial 
losses. The country that was built badly--or maybe well--has 
been destroyed, Marriage and birth rates have dwindled 
dramatically. Drug addiction is on the rampage. Children's 
lives and health are in danger. The hereditary potential of the 
nation is in danger. Every normal citizen must think of only 
one thing: to save the country somehow from the current 
catastrophic process of autogenocide. Those who think that this 
is just excessive panic have ambition that is more important to 
them than the fate of the country. 
  I may be mistaken, but there is no time for doubts now. 
Waiting and useless postponement is the evil today. It is not 
like me to look for the culprit who drove the country to this 
state and to blame someone or a group of people. We must stop 
passing the buck if we want to avoid the fate of the Biblical 
[word indistinct]. Yes, we are all to blame for whatever has 
happened to us. God will judge us for our sins very soon. It 
is the punishment for a lie. If we do not stop telling lies, 
then our judgment will continue. It is clear. All it takes is 
normal reasoning, an elemental conscience, and a sense of 
responsibility. 
  The war has changed its face today. It has been socially 
reincarnated. Our own compatriots--by carrying out a 
sabotage--are trying to slit those vital arteries that are still 
pulsating, to break the power and engineering system, to get 
hold of fuel, and to deprive the country of a possibility for 
life. The country is being brutally murdered by bandits wearing 
either ties or guns. The treasury has been destroyed. In 
effect, we are a country that does not have money. People are 
dying of hunger. Children and women have become miserable and 
poor. Moral norms, which still exist, are dwindling day by day. 
If Davit Guramishvili [Georgian poet] were looking at our 
conditions today, he would forget the trouble that Georgia was 
living through in his time. We all know it very well. 
  What will save us? Only telling the truth. We must give our 
condition a name and an accurate diagnosis and think about 
tomorrow. Before we say something, compare the thought with the 
inner voice of our conscience. I will tell you directly what 
nearly 99 percent of the population thinks, but not a single 
percent says what they are thinking aloud. I will tell you what 
I have to say, irrespective of what you do. Trample me over or 
embellish me with different epithets of a traitor. I prefer to 
die rather than live such life. Therefore, do not let anybody 
think that I will be afraid. Neither should they think that 
they will traditionally go down in history as patriots or 
traitors. This time it will be God who will decide who is a 
traitor. 
  God forgive me for using his name so frequently, but even a 
poisoned atheist must see now that God is near us, and he is not 
stroking us but is here with fire and a sword because we are 
telling lies and are lying to the country. If we do not 
comprehend this, then more disaster will come. It is wrong to 
say what additional disaster can happen to us. 
  By joining the CIS, we have made one step forward toward 
Russia, and Russia toward us. They are not throwing their hats 
up in the air exclaiming: What happiness! Georgia has honored 
us! Russia is telling us directly that she will move forward to 
us by as many steps as we move toward her. We will be your 
brothers if you want to be our brothers. 
  We are talking with Russia by issuing ultimatums, however. 
We can talk to Russia in the language of brotherhood and trust, 
and it will be more honorable. Personally, I will be proud to 
be Russia's brother, but those who will not probably have a 
better brother. I will tell you honestly that we will not find 
a more reliable brother than Russia. There are no states or 
families who do not have brothers or allies. 
  I call on you to talk to Russia in the same language as the 
great Ilya Chavchavadze [Georgian 19th century writer] used to 
talk to Russia. Ilya is more alive today than any of us is 
alive. I call on you to talk to Russia in the language of trust 
and friendship. If we are late, however, then we will cease to 
exist. If we were to survive, then nobody would want to be our 
brother. Let us talk to Russia in the same way as our fathers 
and grandfathers did. Russia saved us once. She united a 
country torn asunder. If we do not admit it, then let me remind 
you that God does not like either an ungrateful man or people. 
It is a Biblical truth. 
  I know that I will irritate you, but may you be irritated. I 
would rather kneel before Russia than see my people kneel. If 
somebody else has a talent to do the contrary, then may God 
judge them. I support talking to Russia in the language of 
brotherhood, trust, and openness. I am asking her to support my 
country actively in order to save it and to help get to its feet. 
  I would like to ask those who have a different view not to 
waste time by talking about my treachery but to give us, not an 
alternative for Georgia's heroic self-destruction, but a 
specific program for saving Georgia honorably. 
  I will be more specific. Let those who have a different view 
present to us an alternative view, but not the traditional 
rigmarole like: Some resolution must be found. Let them present 
only specific views. 
  The issue of joining the ruble zone must be put on the 
agenda 
as soon as possible. I am not sure whether we will be accepted, 
but we must try. We are the country where there is no money, 
and there are no salaries. History has not seen a country 
without money for a long time. If anybody knows of other 
financial sources and possibilities, then I admire him. I will 
remind you once again. I am talking specifically about cash and 
not an indulgence. Clever politicians will favor this point of 
view, but those people whose pockets are lined with dollars and 
rubles will, of course, oppose it. They are making a mistake 
here, however, because their dollars or rubles will go down the 
drain if the country is destroyed. 
  Those who say that order can only be maintained by using 
law- 
enforcement bodies are mistaken because a penniless policemen is 
a potential bandit and maybe a real one. A hungry policeman 
will be thinking of getting food, and he will not be thinking 
about high ideals and state order. 
  Deputies, it must not be difficult either for you or for 
Russia to guess about the tragic state of the author of these 
lines. I wanted and still want the kind of Georgia that will be 
able, not only to defend itself, but also to defend others. I 
repeat: Georgia has to be saved today. I call on all of you to 
stop labelling me and to think about the way to save Georgia, a 
way that can be seen. 
  Vakhtang Goguadze. Thank you for your attention.

  [Text] As INTERFAX learned from well-informed sources in 
Russia's Foreign Ministry, President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine 
accepted President Boris Yeltsin's invitation to come to Moscow 
and join the upcoming Russian-American summit. 
  It is already known that the U.S. President's visit to 
Russia 
and his talks with Boris Yeltsin are scheduled for January 
12-15. The meeting between the three presidents is expected to 
take place in Moscow on January 14th. 
  As a senior official from Russia's Foreign Ministry told 
INTERFAX, Leonid Kravchuk's arrival in Moscow became possible 
thanks to the progress reached at trilateral 
Russian-American-Ukrainian consultations in Washington, where 
the problem of nuclear arms deployed on Ukrainian soil was under 
discussion. 
  "In the Russian capital, Kravchuk will evidently reaffirm 
all 
commitments concerning nuclear weapons made by Ukraine earlier," 
the Russian diplomat said. This involves the START-I treaty and 
the Lisbon Protocol to it, he explained. 
  As it is known, last November Ukraine's parliament ratified 
the treaty with numerous reservations. As for the Lisbon 
Protocol, it was ratified with the exception of Article 5, which 
guarantees Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty as a denuclearized state. 
  "The extremely negative reaction" displayed by the world 
community, above all by Russia and the U.S., was understood by 
Leonid Kravchuk, who announced his intention to submit the 
START-I treaty for ratification to Ukraine's new parliament, 
which is to be elected on March 27th, the diplomat said. 
  INTERFAX's source described the allegations that the U.S. 
President might make changes in the plans for his European tour 
in order to visit Kiev as "unfounded." "The meeting to be held 
by the three presidents in Moscow makes Bill Clinton's trip to 
Kiev pointless," he said. 
  According to him, the three presidents' meeting in Moscow 
will evidently result in some document, possibly a declaration, 
in which the stands taken by the three sides and Ukraine's 
commitments will be clearly stated. 
  As the diplomat said, one more declaration -- on the outcome 
of the Russian-American summit -- is expected to be adopted in 
Moscow. "This will be a general document reflecting the present 
state of bilateral relations," he said. "In addition, the head 
of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, and Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher will sign on behalf of their countries a 
number of `routine' agreements, in particular on air 
transportation." 
  According to INTERFAX's source, the Russian-American talks, 
both bilateral and otherwise, will be held in the Kremlin. 
However, some meetings might take place at one of President 
Yeltsin's out-of-town residences, he conceded. 
  At the request of the American side, a meeting with the 
Russian public has been included in the already coordinated 
program for President Clinton's visit to Moscow, the diplomat 
noted. "On January 14, the American president will address 
Russian journalists and the public in one of Ostankino's 
television studios. Evidently, this event will be presented 
live," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "Partnership </F>
for United, Peaceful, and Democratic Europe"] 
  [Text] On 10 January, the government heads of the NATO 
states will try to find an answer to the new challenges in terms 
of security policy in Europe. Should the North Atlantic 
Alliance be extended to the East? How can the security 
interests of the Eastern Europeans and the Russians be taken 
into consideration equally? What roles should organizations such 
as the European Union, the Western European Union [WEU], the 
CSCE, and the NATO Cooperation Council [NACC] play in this 
connection? With the contribution of Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU ends a series of 
discussions that includes articles by national and international 
politicians and scientists on this issue: 
  It has become a hackneyed phrase to say that Europe is 
living 
in a decisive period of its history. Still, particularly today, 
this statement is more true than ever before. Major events are 
taking place in both Western and Eastern Europe. With the 
European Union, which is preparing for the accession of new 
members, integration has reached a new stage. Russia has freed 
itself of the remnants of the Soviet political system and is now 
entering a stage of parliamentary democracy, which rests on a 
stable, solid constitutional basis. A big step toward economic 
integration has been made within the CIS by signing the 
agreement on economic community. 
  However, it is obvious that the efforts to create a 
democratic Europe as one united entity are falling behind 
tendencies toward a fragmentation of our continent and the 
emergence of new dangers and threats. Which of these 
developments will gain the upper hand depends to a great extent 
on the decisions that have to be made by the responsible 
European politicians at the NATO summit and the CSCE summit in 
Budapest this year. An ill-chosen peace structure for Europe 
can become a burden for all Europeans just like a bad design for 
a house and can itself become the reason for frictions and 
conflicts, similarly to what happened in the past through the 
Versailles Treaty. We must not repeat the mistakes of our 
forefathers. 
  By what objectives should the general security system, which 
has to be created by the Europeans, be guided? What criteria 
should it fulfill? What paths can be pursued for its 
implementation? 
<H5>  The Trap of Simple and Quick Solutions </H5>
  There is no lack of simple solutions for Europe's security 
problems that appear superficially efficient. In short, one can 
say that they essentially consist of the extension of Western 
institutions, whose existence was justified in the Cold War era, 
to the countries of Eastern Europe and to Russia. Here the main 
attention goes to the quickest possible integration of the 
Central European countries into Western military-political 
structures. 
  These recommendations are based on two myths that are 
regarded by their advocates as axioms of current European 
policy. First, the thesis of a "security vacuum" in Central 
Europe, of a "gray area," which almost inevitably becomes the 
site for Russian-German rivalries or falls into the sphere of 
Russian expansion. Second, the thesis of "Russia's move toward 
a nationalist, imperialist policy" as a result of the recent 
parliamentary election. 
  The solution is produced by taking these two statements 
together: NATO should protect the countries of Central Europe 
against the inevitable thrust from the east. The "guard house 
on the Rhine" should thus be shifted to the banks of the Bug. 
This request is substantiated by references to the West's 
"moral obligation" toward the young democracies in the region 
and by reflections about the "natural geopolitical interests" of 
the Western nations themselves. 
  In my opinion, this approach replaces the ability to spot 
dangers, which is essential for any politician, with a strategy 
that does not only assume the "worst scenario" but even provokes 
it. 
  One can seriously speak of a "security vacuum" in Central 
and Eastern Europe only if one claims and predicts with equal 
seriousness the existence of hostile security-political blocks 
in Europe, in whatever form, and the continued existence of 
hostility between the East and the West. Put differently: To 
support the thesis of a "security vacuum" means to deny the 
essence of the all-European process, which is expressed in the 
Paris Charter: the unity of the democratic peoples of Europe. 
This would be the biggest declaration of bankruptcy of all of 
European politics, which, despite seemingly insurmountable 
difficulties, tore down the Berlin Wall, brought German unity, 
and led to the collapse of the totalitarian monsters of the 20th 
century. Instead of moving forward, one is making a panic step 
backwards by at least half a century. 
  The "security vacuum" is bound to restore rivalries between 
Moscow and Berlin in Central Europe. Yet, this would be a step 
backwards, dictated by fears and the ignorance of what has been 
achieved. Today there are two major democratic states in Europe 
-- the Russian Federation and the FRG, two partners that 
cooperate politically and economically and are united through a 
bilateral treaty and through their participation in the CSCE 
process. To pave the way for a confrontation between these two 
states in any "gray area" would mean to challenge German-Russian 
partnership as the greatest feat of the current Europe and to 
undermine the foundation of European stability. 
  In the strategy of the "worst scenario," one can see the 
inertia both in the interpretation of the "threat from the East" 
and the appropriate counter-recipe. If the worst of all 
scenarios is predicted -- the renewal of Russian imperialism -- 
then one must not start from an attack of "Soviet tanks" against 
the East, but one must start from the repetition of the Yugoslav 
drama in the former Soviet Union. The consequence would be 
millions of refugees, disasters in the major industrial 
complexes, and the danger of a use of tactical nuclear arms. 
What could NATO do in such a situation for the protection of 
its eastern members? The cloud of the various Chernobyls would 
certainly be enough for all of Europe. The "guard house on the 
Bug" would not have the necessary power to help anyone at all. 
  Yet, it is exactly such an overhasty extension of NATO that 
might provoke this worst case scenarios. It would serve the 
extremists in Russia as a strong argument for a revival of the 
Russian empire and for resistance against the "attack from the 
West." Hence, the strategy of the "worst scenario" is 
particularly dangerous because it includes a self-fulfilling 
prophecy. 
<H5>  The Russian Factor for European Security </H5>
  Fears of a new "threat from the east" may be dispelled 
mainly 
through a strategy of partnership with democratic Russia, which 
has embarked on the path toward a law-governed state and the 
market economy. Those who speak of an "aggressive" Russian 
policy in Europe cannot produce a single shred of evidence, 
apart from statements by some Russian politicians who do not 
have any influence on the determination of the course of the 
government of this country. In real life, one can usually speak 
of an aggressive foreign policy only when a country declares the 
conquest of other countries as its objective, pursues an 
offensive military doctrine, and supports an ideology to this 
effect. 
  These criteria do not apply to the Russia of today. The 
Russian president's foreign policy has proven that we want to 
achieve our country's interests as a nation state through 
partnership and not through confrontation with the world around 
us. This objective is supported by our democratic constitution. 
Russia does not have any territorial claims against any country 
in the world, including countries in Central and Eastern Europe. 
According to Russia's new military doctrine, our armed forces 
serve the sole purpose of defending our country and our allies 
and of peacemaking efforts in line with Russia's international 
obligations. As a military power, Russia is limited to the 
quantity necessary for defense, as established by the treaty on 
conventional disarmament in Europe and the START I and START II 
Treaties. All military activities are predictable and have been 
laid bare within the framework of the applicable agreements on 
confidence-building measures. Speaking of a "Russian threat" 
under these circumstances means to deliberately twist facts. 
  The success of right-wing nationalist forces in the recently 
held parliamentary election is not a symptom for a pathological 
decay of Russian society but a vaccine for a healthy organism, 
which, of course, leads to an increased temperature. There 
cannot be a deep fertile ground for really pro-fascist 
conditions in Russia, which did more for the defeat of fascism 
in World War II than any other country in the world. The people 
did not caste their votes for a "campaign against the West" or 
for an "advance toward the warm seas," and neither for the 
renewal of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp by force. 
They voted against the ambitions and the self-complacency of 
some reformers, against their inability to explain the people 
the objectives of the reform in a simple language that people 
can understand, and against lacking social protection of the 
population, and an insufficient struggle against crime. 
Comparisons with the Germany of 1933, which are now popular, are 
only acceptable to mobilize forces for the defense of Russian 
democracy, but not to establish the allegedly inevitable fate, 
its defeat. 
  The Russian democrats have started to draw the necessary 
conclusions from the sobering lesson of the parliamentary 
election. The reform program will clearly be revised in favor of 
strengthening social measures. We are determined to fight 
against crime without any mercy. Yet there is no and there will 
not be any flirting with right-wing extremism. We reject any 
overt or covert form of extremism, aggressive nationalism, and 
fascism. 
  The West must also draw its conclusions from the election 
success of Zhirninovkiy's Liberal Democratic Party. Our 
partners must revise their tone and accents in the dialogue with 
Russia. Constant preaching and criticism are inappropriate for 
talks with Moscow. Partnership is hardly reconcilable with 
proposals that we should either accept or reject as a whole 
without being granted the right to revise them with a view to 
our own interests. Such attempts are sometimes being made when 
it comes to evaluating the Yugoslavia conflict or the situation 
in Libya and Iraq. 
  It is precisely now that Russia must have a stronger 
feeling of support from abroad for its reform policy. What is 
essential is a clear, well-developed strategy for cooperation 
between Russia and its democratic partners in the West. At the 
moment, in many respects, we remain at the level of a generally 
correct "idea of partnership" (Russia and the West are partners 
because they belong to the democratic community of states), but 
our actions are based on decisions of the moment. When Russia 
made its entrance on the international stage as an independent 
state, this approach was the only one possible. However, this 
stage is now over. We need new strategic formulas and 
mechanisms for their implementation that fully correspond to the 
present quality of our relations. What is most important is 
that the cooperation that Russia was promised in Tokyo must be 
put into practice without reservations. Europe does not need a 
strategy in which Russia's return to imperialism forms, as it 
were, a "built-in" component, but a system-shaping strategy that 
promotes the unity of all the democratic states in Europe. 
<H5>  Partnership for a United Europe </H5>
  At the end of the 1940's, Western politicians were able to 
find a genuine strategic answer to the great problems of their 
times -- the rebuilding of Western Europe and the resistance 
against Stalin's expansionist policies. Adequate mechanisms 
were set up in good time, including the foundation of the 
European Community and NATO. Here we are talking not about 
dismantling well-proven mechanisms, but about adjusting them to 
the new realities and drawing them into a truly all-European 
system of security and cooperation. 
  In creating a new architecture for Europe, one has to pay 
urgent attention to a number of criteria, including the 
following: 
  -- A balanced, gradual approach to the creation of the 
European security system. Here, "shock diplomacy" methods and 
policies of accomplished facts are excluded. The Russian side 
supports thorough consultations between all interested parties. 
We are conducting such a dialogue in the runup to the NATO 
summit with partners in the North Atlantic Alliance, in Central 
Europe, and with neutral states. 
  -- Openness of regional organizations and institutions as a 
surety for a successful adjustment to the new European 
realities. Russia has no right to stipulate who and who may not 
join NATO. However, we do have the right to proceed on the 
assumption that the North Atlantic Alliance will take into 
account the special features of an unavoidably long transition 
period and -- if one looks even further into the future -- will 
emphasize the point, enshrined in NATO's articles, that states 
that NATO remains open for any democratic European or Atlantic 
state to become a member. It should not be excluded from the 
outset that Russia will apply for NATO membership at some time 
in the future. It is important to ensure an effective and equal 
partnership in a period a general change and adaptation to one 
another. 
  -- The guarantee of an equal level of security for all 
European states. In Europe, "first and second-class security," 
"gray areas," and "special spheres of influence" are just as 
unacceptable as "isolated regions" and a "cordon sanitaire." 
  -- The treaty-based foundation of European security, as it 
has emerged, must be preserved. This also concerns the treaty 
for final settlement in relation to Germany. 
  -- Exclusion of territorial claims between European states. 
Are the intentions of certain Baltic states to join NATO 
compatible with territorial demands against their neighbors? 
  The chief goals of our proposed strategy for partnership at 
the political level and in the field of security should be the 
following: 
  First, development of Euro-Atlantic cooperation. The 
transformation of the CSCE into a political organization for the 
entire region and of the NACC into an autonomous organization 
for military-political cooperation but one closely linked to the 
CSCE. Their aim must be to coordinate the efforts of NATO, the 
WEU, and the CIS in strengthening international security, acting 
to strengthen peace, and providing genuine protection for the 
rights of national, linguistic, and other minorities in Europe. 
I regard the declaration adopted at the CSCE conference in Rome 
on combating aggressive nationalism as a significant step in 
this direction. 
  As far as the NACC is concerned, one should not regard it 
as an anteroom for NATO according to the "NATO plus" formula, 
but as envisaged when it was originally set up, as a independent 
instrument of equal partnership between one-time enemies for the 
building of a new Europe. Proposals for expanding NACC to 
include neutral European states and to form a compact 
secretariat for the Cooperation Council are of considerable 
interest. The NACC itself must direct its work toward 
developing cooperation in the security field, in military 
planning, arms conversion, and maintaining peace. 
  Second, the creation of a system of overlapping security 
guarantees between the states of Western and Eastern Europe. 
The closer the states are intertwined with one another, the 
stronger the network of their relations will be. For this 
reason, should one not consider, for example, creating a 
security network of mutually complementary treaties in the 
security field between Germany and Poland and Poland and 
Germany? Corresponding treaties could also be proposed for 
other states in the region. 
  Third, I welcome the proposals made by my German colleague 
Klaus Kinkel concerning concluding an agreement for cooperation 
and consultations between NATO, on one side, and the countries 
of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and Ukraine, on the 
other. It would be useful to set up a communications channel 
between NATO and the CIS. 
  Fourth, increasing the ability of the European states to 
ensure peace. For the time being, frankly speaking, the East 
and the West have as yet found no joint [solidarische] answer to 
the challenge posed by the local conflicts in Yugoslavia and the 
former Soviet Union. In the meantime, these conflicts are 
developing into a big European security problem. Our partners 
should effectively support the efforts of Russia, which is 
carrying the main burden of ensuring peace in the post-Soviet 
area. The establishment of a voluntary fund for supporting the 
efforts to guarantee peace in the CIS is now on the agenda of 
the day. NACC can provide practical support (such as financial 
aid in training personnel for peacekeeping operations). 
  Fifth, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in Europe. It is 
a mistake to regard the strategic missiles dispute between 
Russia and Ukraine as one aspect of the division of the Soviet 
legacy. This is a matter of preventing a contravention of the 
nuclear weapon nonproliferation regulations and affects the 
interests of the whole of Europe. Our partners in NATO 
supported the Russian position at NACC's meeting in Brussels 
when they rejected Kiev's attempts to represent the decisions of 
the Supreme Soviet as a ratification of the START I Treaty. The 
strategy of the European partnership must provide a strong 
incentive for strict observance of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
  The economic elements of the partnership deserve special 
mention. Their essence lies in the transition from isolated, 
chronically delayed support programs to including Russia in the 
international division of labor on an equal, nondiscriminatory 
basis and in providing Russia with access to European markets. 
  In many respects, the fields for action that I have 
mentioned 
have connections with the proposals that my colleagues from many 
European countries have put forward in recent months. The 
dialogue concerning a security partnership for Europe is already 
gaining intensity. I hope that the NATO summit will further 
this development in a useful way through its balanced and 
farsighted decisions. Russia is a responsible and committed 
partner for the members of the North Atlantic Alliance in the 
development of such a strategy.

  [Text] Bucharest January 10 TASS -- Russia was not 
conquered as a result of the disappearance of a bipolar 
geo-political system. As before it remains a powerful state, a 
great power which is only passing through a difficult stage, 
apparently, just as other East European countries, Romania's 
Defence Minister Lieutenant-General Niculae Spiroiu emphasised 
in an interview with ITAR-TASS. According to him, it concerns 
the selection of a new social, political and economic system by 
the people of Russia, and it does not at all mean that Russia 
has lost some kind of battle. 
  As far as ensuring security is concerned, after the 
disintegration of the Warsaw Treaty Organization its member 
states were left in a vacuum. That why it was natural for them 
to strive to improve their state of affairs. A kind of 
competition started to join NATO, the minister said. I presume 
that at the NATO summit in Brussels a decision will be adopted 
within the American initiative network of "partnership in the 
name of peace" and provide these states certain support in the 
sphere of security, Spiroiu noted. This initiative will be a 
step ahead, according to him. 
  Russia's apprehensions in connection with the widening of 
NATO are very well understood by us, the head of the Romanian 
defence department indicated. That is the reason why we 
consider that Russia should participate in programmes of 
cooperation with NATO. If Russia is not included in the new 
structures of security, then they will not get the needed trust 
in them and will not become sufficiently effective. The Russian 
Federation cannot be excluded from this process. There is a 
need to create a system of equal security for all in which 
Russia will acquire its place and role corresponding to its 
importance. Any kind of discrimination would only lead to 
suspicion, tension and potential hot spots of instability, the 
Romanian defence minister said.

  [Text] Washington January 9 TASS -- President Clinton left 
for Europe late on Saturday [8 January] for an eight-day 
mission. He is to attend a NATO summit, then fly on to Prague, 
Moscow, Minsk, and to Geneva for a January 16 meeting with 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad before flying home. 
  According to top officials of the U.S. Administration, the 
President's European tour pursues three goals. The first goal 
is to bring the U.S. "partnership for peace" concept up for U.S. 
NATO allies' endorsement. The concept envisions the 
establishment of the bloc's closer military cooperation with the 
former socialist countries of Europe. 
  The second goal is to show U.S. support for democratic 
processes in former communist states, and the third one is to 
reduce the spread of nuclear weapons and work for a greater 
Europe that is more economically vibrant.

<F P=106> [Manki Ponomarev report: "U.S. President Leaves for Europe"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton left Washington late 
Saturday evening for a 10-day tour of European countries. He 
intends to visit the Belgian capital, where a meeting of NATO 
heads of state and government will be held 10-11 January. A 
meeting will then take place in Prague with the leaders of the 
Czech and Slovak Republics, Poland, and Hungary. The president 
will pay a state visit to Russia 12-15 January, after which he 
goes to Belarus. The U.S. Administration head's tour will end 
in Geneva, where he will hold talks with the president of Syria. 
  Setting out the aims of his trip to journalists, Bill 
Clinton 
stressed: "I hope that we will be able to work out a policy in 
relation to Europe which will not lead to the formation of new 
`lines' dividing up the continent but will further its 
political, economic, and strategic integration." 
  Three basic tasks face the White House head during his trip, 
according to top figures in the Washington administration. The 
first is to submit for ratification by America's North Atlantic 
alliance partners the U.S. Partnership for Peace concept, which 
envisages the establishment of close cooperation in the defense 
sphere between the bloc and the former socialist states of 
Europe. The second is to demonstrate support for the democratic 
processes in those states. The third is to to help reduce the 
threat from weapons of mass destruction. In this regard Vice 
President Al Gore stated firmly in a radio broadcast to the 
American people devoted to the trip now under way: "One nuclear 
power alone should be the successor to the USSR." 
  Discussion of the Partnership for Peace concept will indeed 
be one of the the main topics of the Brussels meeting. However, 
according to Clinton himself, it is not possible to admit the 
East European countries to NATO as full members because this 
would exclude Russia from the new security alliance and cause 
alarm in Ukraine and other new independent states. The 
president added here that the West is proposing that Russia also 
take part in implementing the Partnership for Peace concept and 
that Russia will thus obtain the opportunity to demonstrate its 
desire for a new future. 
  As far as the state visit to Moscow is concerned, Bill 
Clinton described it as his main task to show support for 
democratic and market reforms in Russia as well as to show 
support for the creation of social mechanisms to reduce the 
impact of the economic "shock" on people. In Moscow, according 
to Strobe Talbott, special envoy and special adviser [sovetnik] 
to the U.S. secretary of state on the new independent states, 
the U.S. President will also declare that "Russia should have 
its own powerful voice" in determining how the "post-Cold War 
situation in the security sphere in Europe and Eurasia" will 
look. The adviser to the secretary of state also noted that, in 
Washington's opinion, "all states formed since the collapse of 
the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact will have the right to join 
the North Atlantic alliance in the future." 
  So the U.S. President's European trip is now under way. One 
can only express the hope that it will bring beneficial results 
not just to the United States but to the other states and 
peoples too.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo January 8 TASS -- The U.S. Administration is 
holding talks with the Russian Government with the aim to 
specify the content of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM), 
concluded by the USSR and the United States in 1972, prominent 
U.S. politicians Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar said today, 
responding to an ITAR-TASS question during a press conference in 
Tokyo. 
  Sam Nunn, who is head of the Committee on Armed Services in 
the U.S. Congress, explained that the point at issue is not the 
revision of the fundamentals of that unlimited document aimed at 
continually reminding people of the nuclear threat, but the 
clearing up and fixing of basic differences between the ABM 
system within the framework of an individual theatre of 
operations, which is not banned by the ABM treaty, and a 
strategic nuclear ABM system, which is the main subject of that 
document. The NIHON KEIZAI newspaper reported today that the 
settlement of the issues dealing with the ABM treaty may be 
speeded up by the Russian-American summit in Moscow, scheduled 
for next week. 
  Touching upon the nuclear problems facing former USSR 
republics, the U.S. senators, who visited Russia recently, said 
that the ensurance of long-term storage, safe elimination and 
prevention of smuggling abroad of the splitter materials, 
released as a result of the dismantling of combat missiles and 
nuclear-powered submarines, are the most important of them. 
  According to Lugar, the problem for Russia, Ukraine and 
Kazakhstan is how to divide in a just way the responsibility for 
the storage and processing of highly enriched uranium. He 
stressed that in principle the U.S. is ready to purchase from 
the former USSR republics part of that uranium and process it so 
that it can be used for peaceful purposes. 
  The problem of Ukraine, which is not living up to its 
commitment to become a nuclear-free country, should be resolved 
as soon as possible. According to Nunn, Kiev should join the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratify the START agreements 
without setting the terms, which make the ratification senseless. 
  The senators stressed that, along with problems created by 
the nuclear disarmament, there are others, which are potentially 
no less dangerous and which are connected with nuclear power 
plants on the territory of the former USSR. Of course, it is 
economically expedient that the International Monetary Fund and 
other international financial institutions are prompting Russia 
and other republics to fully liberalise prices of energy 
carriers, reducing the way to the world market, Sam Nunn pointed 
out. However, one cannot rule out a possibility that in case of 
such a transition some countries, like Ukraine for example, will 
have to put to full use all the nuclear power plants they have 
in order to obtain sources of cheap energy, which will increase 
the probability of serious accidents.

  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- Russian-American relations 
in the defence and security sphere have been marked by high 
intensity and big scope in the last few years, Dmitriy 
Kharchenko, head of the Russian Defence Ministry International 
Department, said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday [10 January], 
Kharchenko said that in 1994 Russia and the United States plan 
to carry out 26 joint projects, compared to 17 in 1993. 
  He said the documents on mutual understanding and military 
cooperation signed by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev 
during his official visit to the U.S. last year open up new 
prospects for partnership between the two countries. The 
documents have also sealed both sides' intention to leave the 
years of nuclear confrontation between the two superpowers in 
the past for good. 
  Grachev and his American counterpart agreed to meet 
annually, 
exchange delegations at all levels and train the Russian 
military in the U.S. The delegations of the two ministries will 
discuss a wide range of issues, including national security and 
employment of the former army personnel in civilian sectors of 
the economy. The two countries will also provide each other 
with information. 
  The agreements provide for exchanges of ships and aircraft, 
joint manoeuvres and war games, Kharchenko said. 
  In April 1993 the armies of the two countries conducted the 
first joint manoeuvres to rescue the crews of aircraft and 
helicopters in the Polar region. In June the U.S. and NATO 
navy forces held war games in the Baltic Sea which were also 
attended by warships of all Baltic Sea states, including the 
Russian mine- laying destroyer Nastoychiviy. 
  Russia and the U.S. will conduct joint manoeuvres of their 
peace-keeping forces in the Volga region this coming summer, 
Kharchenko said.

  [Text] Moscow January 10 ITAR-TASS -- A new trend is 
emerging in relations between Russia and the United States: 
Transition has become from technological confrontation to 
technological partnership, according to Viktor Glukhikh, 
chairman of the State Committee for Defence Industries of the 
Russian Federation. 
  According to Glukhikh, one hundred joint projects in the 
field of basic and applied research, development, production and 
marketing are already being implemented. Recently a memorandum 
of mutual understanding was signed with the U.S. National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration which promises to become 
one of the major joint projects. It sets the parameters for 
joint basic research in aeronautics which will be implemented 
with the help of the potential, technical capacities and 
intellectual resources of both Russia and the United States. 
  We developed and produced arms separately but are now 
looking 
for sensible and ecologically clean methods of eliminating them, 
Glukhikh stressed. 
  Moreover, we have thrown open the doors of "closed" 
factories 
and research institutes to demonstrate our readiness to 
cooperate in the technological fields in which Russia's priority 
is beyond doubt. It is not accidental therefore that recognised 
American industrial leaders such as the Boeing, Pratt and 
Whitney, Hughes and Rockwell international corporations are 
among our present partners. 
  We have already passed over to the American side packages of 
proposals relating to conversion and involving enterprises in 
practically all defence industries. We would like to hope that 
the upcoming visit of President Bill Clinton to Russia will 
further boost Russian-American contacts in the field of research 
and industrial cooperation, Viktor Glukhikh said.

<F P=106> [Pavel Shinkarenko report under the "Talk of the World" </F>
rubric: "Warren Christopher's Alter Ego"] 
  [Excerpts] On New Year's Eve the U.S. President nominated 
Strobe Talbott for the post of U.S. deputy secretary of state. 
Thus on the eve of the first official visit to Moscow by the 
U.S. President, the list of "portfolios" which Talbott has 
already held for eight months -- special envoy and special 
adviser to the secretary of state on new independent states -- 
has been supplemented by a new portfolio: He has become 
Christopher's "alter ego." 
  The State Department chief commented as follows on the new 
appointment of his envoy: "He is the most suitable man for the 
job. I am convinced of Talbott's capabilities, his knowledge of 
international relations, and his human qualities. I can 
certainly say that Strobe will make a unique and long-term 
contribution to the formulation and implementation of U.S. 
foreign policy...." [passage omitted] 
  "I have known and respected S. Talbott for over 25 years and 
have always regarded him as a man of enormous potential, 
intellect, and insight," Bill Clinton stressed in turn. "Strobe 
is coping admirably with his present duties as special envoy to 
the former Soviet republics. I am absolutely convinced that he 
will be just as successful in his new post at the State 
Department." 
  This new appointment of Strobe Talbott's is viewed by 
analysts on THE WASHINGTON POST as one aspect of Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher's wider efforts to put right at least 
two weaknesses for which he has been criticized. The first is 
the not particularly inspiring manner of his public statements, 
and the second is his inability to anticipate potential crises 
before they occur. Christopher's entourage also believes that 
Talbott will continue to carry out his principal task -- dealing 
with relations with Russia and the other republics of the former 
USSR. However, he is now allowed to make public comments on 
foreign policy problems. 
  The State Department's number two has already availed 
himself 
of this opportunity. Speaking at the National Press Club in 
Washington, he stated that "Russia is on course for reforms, and 
the international community should do everything in its power to 
encourage movement in this direction." At the same time S. 
Talbott stressed: "When we say that we support the reforms 
course in Russia, we mean the following. First, we support 
political leaders who are committed to the principles of 
democracy and reserve for the people the final say on who should 
rule the country and what the country's policy should be. This 
is why we so doggedly support Boris Yeltsin, because over the 
last two years he has on several occasions resolved complex 
situations to the satisfaction of the Russian people. Second, 
we support economic reforms. And third, we support a reform of 
foreign policy direction, which is a major component of our 
policy." 
  Within the next few days we will see how this aim will be 
put 
into practice when the U.S. President comes to Moscow.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman </F>
of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, by unidentified 
correspondent in Moscow; date not given; from the "Panorama" 
program--recorded; Zhirinovskiy speaks in Russian with 
superimposed Hungarian translation] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] The office of the misleadingly 
named the Liberal Democratic Party is situated on the third 
floor of a residential block of apartments on a back street. 
  Hungarian leaders will very soon meet President Clinton. 
Hungary would very much like to join NATO, or at least in the 
Clinton initiative, the Partnership for Peace. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This is Hungary's private affair; however, I 
would not recommend that any single country of the globe join 
military blocs hastily. It would not lead to any good. It is 
better to remain a neutral country. 
  Regarding NATO membership, even if Hungary, Poland, 
Bulgaria, 
the Czech Republic, and Slovakia were to be admitted as members, 
they would be admitted as tiles on the roof and not as the 
columns of the structure. 
  [Correspondent] The issue here is security, however, and 
many say that it is specifically you, Zhirinovskiy, who is 
threatening the security of the neighbors of the former Soviet 
Union. What do you say to that? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I deny it. We do not threaten anybody, 
especially not in the West--God forbid. 
  [Correspondent] President Yeltsin bowed his head in front of 
the grave of Imre Nagy. If you were the president of Russia, 
would you repeat this gesture? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I do not bow anywhere. I will look, first of 
all, at the way in which the tombs of Soviet and Russian 
soldiers are treated. If, as in Sofia, they are covered with 
graffiti, if paint has dirtied the memorial, I will not bow my 
head in front of anybody in a country like that. On the 
contrary, I would leave that country as soon as possible. 
  [Correspondent] Above your head here is a map of Alaska. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, that is a historical map. That is what 
Russia was like 120 years ago. We do not want to restore these 
borders. That was when the Russian empire was flourishing. Why 
should we not be proud of the finest chapters of our history? 
  [Correspondent] So this is not a plan for the future? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There is no question of that. It is only 
history -- just as the 12 December victory was, for me, the 
finest day of my life, and 12 June will be the same. This does 
not mean that I am expunging the rest of my entire life, but 
they are the two most important and happiest days of my life. 
  It is history--merely history. Heaven forbid that this is 
the case again. This type of thing is not (?our aim). 
  [Correspondent] You said not long ago, however, that you 
wished to send 300,000 soldiers to Germany and that Germany 
would be a poor country because it would be compelled to pay you 
reparations. If you are able to threaten Germany, which is some 
distance away, then Hungary, which is smaller and nearer, has 
more grounds to be afraid. Is that not the case? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] That is an erroneous interpretation. What 
was the issue at hand? Germany is paying Israel considerable 
reparations for almost every single Jew who was killed. Why 
have the Russians, who lost the greatest number of people in the 
last war and who defeated German fascism, received the smallest 
reparations? That is why I say: If the relationship between 
Russia and Germany deteriorates, a review of compensation issues 
is not ruled out. 
  If I understand correctly, Kohl would have been ready to pay 
Gorbachev 100 billion marks for East Germany. However, 
Gorbachev was satisfied with 10 billion. 
  [Correspondent] From where do you get these figures? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] From the press. Gorbachev agreed on 14 
billion. 
  [Correspondent] Marks? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, but they would have given more, so we do 
not know why Gorbachev requested less for East Germany. What is 
at issue here is not a military threat. What is at issue is 
that there should not be dual standards, that there should be a 
uniform standard in politics concerning reparations, security, 
national issues, and the economy--only in this sense. 
  This is all I was thinking about when I spoke about these 
issues--not at all about the use of force or armed forces. Our 
soldiers will never take a step in the direction of the West. 
Never. They have nothing to seek in the West. 
  [Correspondent] You spoke differently to the newspaper WELT 
AM SONNTAG the other day, however. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I said that we had 300,000 soldiers there, 
and 
a suspension of the troop withdrawal was not ruled out if our 
relationship deteriorated, because it is in Germany's interest 
for all of the foreign armies--including U.S., French, British, 
and Dutch troops--to pull out at the same time. Why should only 
the Russians pull out quickly? Our soldiers and officers must 
spend the nights in tents in the taiga, on the steppes. Why? 
Why the haste? 
  This was arranged by Shevardnadze, and where is Shevardnadze 
now? What did he do with his own country? He ruined his own 
country. 
  [Correspondent] So WELT AM SONNTAG distorted your words? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, it distorted them. I was suggesting that 
a deterioration of the Russian-German relationship is not in 
Germany's interest, that occupying troops are still stationed in 
Germany, and we want all of the occupying armies to leave 
Germany. We will make every effort for the Russian troops to 
withdraw--but not too hastily because this would give rise to 
tensions in Russia. This is also contrary to Germany's 
interests. 
  [Correspondent] Since you have a little time, I would like 
to 
ask you a few more questions. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Please, go ahead. 
  [Correspondent] Where should the Russian borders be in the 
future? Along the former Soviet borders? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We will not object if the currently 
independent areas--the former Soviet republics--ask to be 
allowed back to the fold. We will examine the question of 
readmitting them, and then the borders of the former Soviet 
Union will gradually become the borders of Russia. 
  [Correspondent] What is your opinion of what Solzhenitsyn 
said--that the Slav republics, Ukraine, Belarus can come back, 
but it is better if the Muslim and southern republics go 
separate ways because they would be only a burden for the 
Russians? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This reflects nationalistic, psychological, 
and historical viewpoints. If we consider economic viewpoints 
and military strategy, however, then there are certain small, 
specific issues. This, specifically, is what I wrote about in 
my book The Last Push South. 
  [Correspondent] It would be interesting to read. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I would be pleased if it was translated into 
Hungarian. It is now being translated in several countries. It 
describes everything in detail--my entire geopolitical concept, 
the nationality issue. 
  [Correspondent] You recently said that there would be many 
small wars, which have begun to an extent--between Abkhazians 
and Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis --and that these 
peoples would be so weakened that they would fall on their knees 
to plead for their readmittance into the former Soviet Union. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, that is exactly right. 
  [Unidentified announcer] The book's title is The Last 
Push South. It is Zhirinovskiy's Mein Kampf. 
In it, he says that the Russian Army will occupy Afghanistan, 
Turkey, and Iran, and that Russia will be the master from 
Istanbul to Kabul. Of course, just like in every mendacious 
work of this type, it says that this fight will be the last one. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] You also proposed that Macedonia be handed 
over to Bulgaria. What is your opinion of the current southern 
Slav conflict? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The best thing would for all of the foreign 
armies--including the UN troops--to be withdrawn from 
Yugoslavia, and for the Yugoslavs themselves--the Serbians and 
Croatians--to decide their own fate. 
  [Correspondent] What is your opinion of Yeltsin? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] What should it be? He has been the president 
of our country for two-and-a-half years already. He will retire 
in two more years, and he will remain in our memory as Russia's 
first president. 
  [Correspondent] All right, but what kind of economic policy 
is necessary? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Another kind, completely different. He is 
being let down by his team. The Gaydar-Fedorov-Shokhin team 
must go. 
  [Correspondent] What, specifically, should he do? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] He should change the formula of the economic 
reform. 
  [Correspondent] But in what direction? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] For example, support for certain regions of 
the former Soviet Union must be halted. The peaceful conversion 
of the military industry must be halted. The state sector must 
not be ruined. The private sector must not be stifled. Crime 
must be dealt a blow. The situation must be stabilized. There 
must be an end to the division within Russia along national 
lines, so that there are only counties. Such reforms would 
quickly improve our lives. 
  [Correspondent] So the current national autonomous regions 
should cease to exist? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Full rights for every citizen--irrespective 
of nationality. If there is autonomy, it means war--the path 
leading to war. Well, there are some hotbeds of war in the 
ruins of the former Soviet Union [word indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] What is your opinion of Saddam Husayn? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We have never had any special relationship 
with him. What happened historically was simply that the Soviet 
Union invested enormous sums in Iraq. Therefore, Iraq now owes 
us more than $10 billion, and it is ready to pay this. That is 
why it is not in our interest to take part in the embargo 
against Iraq-- just like in the case of the embargo against 
Serbia and the embargo against Libya. 
  [Correspondent] So you want to change policy? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, in that we do not participate in 
embargoes against countries that intend to pay us their debts. 
  [Correspondent] And the pressure exerted on Kim Il-song 
these days? What do you think of it? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There is no problem with that. North Korea 
owes us very little. Perhaps it is not a debtor of ours. We 
also oppose the spread of nuclear weapons. There would be a 
possibility for joint action on this. 
  [Correspondent] Not long ago you mentioned a terrifying 
nonnuclear weapon in the possession of Russia--the elipton. 
What type of weapon is this? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This question is for experts. This weapon is 
stronger than nuclear weapons because its consequences are 
different, and there is no antidote. This is where its strength 
lies. There is no way of defending against it. It is the same 
with the sonic weapon [hangfegyver]. We also have this. What 
happens is that the cartridge detonates, and the sound is such 
that it brings down an entire military division. That is it; 
they are dead. 
  [Correspondent] How does the elipton work? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The elipton has the same effect. There is 
no radiation, no fire. There are no wounds. An entire military 
division simply dies. It is similar to the neutron weapon, but 
the latter has radiation. It has a damaging effect. The 
neutrons enter the human body; those cause the destruction. 
With the former, there is no damage, but all of life is 
immediately destroyed. 
  [Correspondent] Do the Americans not have this type of 
weapon? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No. 
  [Correspondent] No one has it? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No one. Russian scientists developed it 
exclusively. 
  [Correspondent] But no one has yet heard about this weapon. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Because it is secret. 
  [Correspondent] You know, when one speaks with you--and I am 
thinking of your recent statements abroad--we simply are unable 
to ascertain how many types of Zhirinovskiy there are. Because 
there is a Zhirinovskiy who speaks sensibly, and at the same 
time there is a Zhirinovskiy who proposes to the Bulgarians that 
they need a new president, who offends entire countries. We are 
unable to get our bearings with regard to you. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Things must be clarified in a direct manner. 
You have come here, and we are now having a chat. I will 
explain everything if I am invited to Hungary. I will explain 
that no one should fear anything. Never did I want to dismiss 
Bulgaria's president. The whole thing was built up by the 
journalists and by President Zhelyu Zhelev's office. He took 
fright and really thought that I came for that reason. 
  [Correspondent] And your friend? Did you not recommend your 
friend, Svetoslav [Stoilov] as president? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I said to journalists, since they were 
nearby: Here is my friend, Svetoslav. He is a person who has 
done very much for Bulgaria, Macedonia, Eastern Europe, and 
Russia. Such people can become presidents--in Bulgaria and in 
other East European countries. I was speaking in this sense. 
  [Correspondent] Look here: Russian Hitler. This is written 
by [name indistinct]. Here is a quote from a British paper. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Oh, of course! 
  [Correspondent] France warns that Zhirinovskiy is making 
provocative statements. Here you are in the newspaper 
clippings: Decoding the Russian Message, How Should We Decipher 
Zhirinovskiy? This is with what they are preoccupied. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] But here is TIME magazine. They make a very 
good presentation. They write very well. Other means of mass 
media present me in a different way, so there you are. The 
NEWSWEEK article is not so bad, nor is this, either. Look at it. 
  [Correspondent] There are episodes in your life, however, 
that have not been clarified. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Please go ahead and ask. 
  [Correspondent] What did you do for a few years in Turkey? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I worked as an interpreter for eight months. 
I had work experience for a few months. I was a university 
student in my final year at the time, and the fifth year 
consisted of work experience. I gained experience on the radio 
and television committee, and elsewhere as well. Then I went to 
Turkey as an interpreter, with a Russian engineers' delegation. 
  [Correspondent] Gorbachev says that the KGB is pulling your 
strings. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] He says this out of envy. He destroyed the 
party, the country. He ruined the economy. Then a new party 
with a young leader appears who succeeds in making advances in 
the elections. Because of this, he thinks that I am helped by 
someone-- or by a lot of capital, or by the KGB, as the world's 
most powerful secret police. 
  They are unable to accept that we are now living through 
different times. We ourselves created a party. I had very 
little money. There is more now. With regard to KGB-like 
bodies, no one is helping me. I would be pleased if I was given 
money. 
  [Correspondent] So Gorbachev is not telling the truth. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, that is certain. 
  [Correspondent] Another thing from your past. Israel 
supposedly gave you an entry permit as an immigrant. Is that 
true? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, that is a lie. 
  [Correspondent] Israel says this--the Israeli Government. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is a complete lie. Of course, show me the 
supposed relative of mine! If I had a relative there, I would 
be pleased. But I have no relative there. 
  [Correspondent] It is also said .... 
  [Zhirinovskiy, interrupting] I am Russian--I myself, my 
mother, my father, and the whole family. Half of them have 
already died. 
  [Correspondent] It is also said that you participated in the 
establishment of the Shalom association in Moscow. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] That is also a lie. The establishment of 
nationality associations was begun in Moscow five years ago by 
Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, and so forth. All those who live 
here. Almost 1 million people of foreign descent live in Moscow. 
Among them, the Jews also decided to set up a cultural 
association called Shalom. I then visited these associations 
one after the other; I was invited and visited them. I am a 
legal expert, and that was the time that the association's 
statutes were adopted. I made some comments that they liked. 
  [Correspondent] Are there armed men in your party? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, not one--nothing near it. There is not 
one. I do not even have a penknife. All that I have--I bought 
this in Austria--is an ordinary exercise device to strengthen 
one's grip. 
  [Correspondent] So you will use only constitutional means in 
contending for power? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] That only. Heaven forbid. We have never 
organized violent action. In Moscow and in all of Russia, our 
party held the most peaceful rallies. That is history. There 
has never been violence--not a bit. There has never been a 
single scuffle. The whole world has been able to see this. 
Everyone saw these rallies. They were filmed: the most 
peaceful rallies in Moscow and the whole country; the most 
peaceful party members; the most peaceful groups of deputies in 
the regional bodies and at the national level. Everything was 
in full view. 
  The journalists, however, under the influence of certain 
international and national headquarters that oppose me, seek 
compromising facts. They must think up something: Either I am 
not Russian, or I am (?piarist), or anti-Semitic, or fascist, or 
communist, or a KGB person. They struggle. They are envious. 
They are jealous. Even Gorbachev. 
  All that Gorbachev is able to do .... [pauses] He said that 
supposedly. The paper was here somewhere; perhaps I left it at 
home. It was meant to show what he concerns himself with, but 
let's leave it. Let's leave it so that there is no quarrel. 
The whole thing has to do with sensitivities. 
  I gained an unprecedented victory. I agree with that. The 
whole world is upside down. Europe is trying to recover. They 
did not expect a four-year-old party, without special financial 
support, without the direct support of social strata--kolhoz 
members, farmers, the military industry--to be victorious in the 
elections. The instruments of power--the media, money, the 
powerful levers of influence--are in their hands, and they were 
still the losers. 
  That is what shocked them, because what happened here was 
that a military division defeated an army consisting of several 
hundreds of divisions. Naturally, the army consisting of 
several hundreds of divisions faints when a small division 
defeats an enormous army. That fact that one small party 
completely defeated the country's system was a political shock. 
  [Correspondent] Why does your colorful style terrify the 
world? They fear you more than the devil. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] What should we do? The whole world is 
slightly (?spoiled). Here, the communists were harmful; 
everything is atrophied. In the West, Europe is being 
Americanized. Everyone eats and drinks. They eat and drink, 
and then a new, young party appears with a resolute program and 
with energy. This naturally gives the impression of being new. 
Everything new generally is a bit frightening because they do 
not understand what it is--what type of party. 
  I tell everyone in advance to be calm, however. This is a 
democratic, centrist party. There is no danger, either 
domestically or abroad; nor will there ever be a danger. There 
will be only a legal constitutionality--pluralism, democracy, a 
mixed economy, and human rights. 
  Look only at my life story. The subject of one of my studies 
was human rights in the modern world. The topic of another of 
my studies: the writer and the man. Look at what I concerned 
myself with for 47 years. What did I concern myself with? Was 
I [word indistinct] a commando? Did I suppress rebellions? 
Then the price for this would be different. 
  I was a civilian my whole life. I was a soldier in Tbilisi 
for two years. I served in the staff headquarters in Tbilisi 
town center from 0900 until 1800 hours. I pushed papers about 
at the staff headquarters. I was never rebuked for anything. I 
did not abuse anyone. I did not participate in anything. This 
is generally known. 
  Please understand: I am 47 years old. I was born after the 
war. My life and that of my party are open to general view. It 
is unnecessary to think up anything. 
  [Correspondent] Then I thank you for the interview and for 
your time. The future will show what Zhirinovskiy means to 
world. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Good. 
  [Announcer] After this stream of propaganda, the fuehrer set 
off for the Kremlin for a meeting of leaders of groups of 
deputies to the newly elected State Duma. His parting words: 
Europe do not fear! You know, we feel that we have reason to 
be afraid of this so-called liberal democrat.

  [Text] I am in favor of friendship and close cooperation 
between Poland and Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told our 
correspondent Irena Parchimowicz before his announced visit to 
Poland. 
  [Parchimowicz] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told me that he intends 
to visit Poland in the very near future. The leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was in a good mood today and 
declared his fraternal feelings for Poles. Many evil things 
happened in relations between the Tsarist empire and Poland, as 
well as in relations between the Soviet Union and Poland. One 
must forget and neutralize all that, Zhirinovskiy said, so that 
our relations will become good and Poles should not be afraid of 
us, because Russians and Poles are Slav brothers. 
  Asked whether Russia will allow the Germans to take away 
from 
Poland the former Prussian territories, Zhirinovskiy replied 
that he is against any changes of borders, which were finally 
recognized in Helsinki in 1975 at the CSCE conference.

  [Text] Spain's royal court has emphatically denied the 
reports in some of the mass media that King Juan Carlos invited 
Zhirinovskiy, the leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, 
to visit Spain. These reports are totally devoid of any 
meaning, journalists were told by an official spokesman of the 
royal court. 
  According to Spain's EFE agency, Zhirinovskiy had himself 
spoken of the existence of the invitation to visit Spain, and 
his close associate Aleksandr Vengerovskiy claimed that the 
invitation had come through diplomatic channels. 
  Official circles in France recently reacted negatively to 
the 
intention of the Liberal Democratic Party leader to visit Paris 
in February. Earlier he was asked to leave Bulgaria and not 
allowed into Germany.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Jan -- Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad today 
received a letter from Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian 
Federation. The MENA agency reports that the personal message 
from the Russian President to the leader of the Syrian Arab 
Republic "concerns the development of the peace process in the 
Middle East and questions of bilateral relations between Syria 
and Russia." 
  The letter from Boris Yeltsin was handed over by the Russian 
Federation ambassador in Syria to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar'. 
  The Russian Federation, together with the United States, is 
one of the sponsors of the process for a peaceful settlemnt of 
the Middle East conflict between Israel and the Arab states. 
The Arab-Israeli talks began over two years ago at the Madrid 
conference, of which Russia was one of the main organizers.

  [Text] New Delhi January 8 TASS -- "Russia and India have 
favourable prospects of developing bilateral cooperation, 
including in the military sphere," commander-in-chief of the 
Russian ground forces Colonel General Vladimir Semyonov said, 
ending his official visit to India as head of a military 
delegation. 
  According to Semyonov, Russia is committed to developing 
friendly relations with India, regarding it not only as a 
"strong ally, but also as a guarantor of stability in the 
Asia-Pacific region." He said that one of the objectives of the 
visit was to analyse right there, in India, matters dealing with 
military-technical cooperation, which are of interest for both 
sides. We should work for removing doubts that emerged recently 
in the minds of our Indian partners, Semyonov said. 
  During the visit Semyonov held talks with senior officials 
of 
the Indian Defence Ministry and met commanders of all the three 
armed services. They discussed issues connected with the 
organisation in the republic of a production base for the 
modernisation of Russian tanks other other military hardware, 
with which the Indian Army is equipped, as well as its repair 
and operation. 
  The commander of the Russian ground troops visited the 
southern military district, the training centre of the armoured 
troops and the higher artillery school near Puna, the state of 
Maharashtra. Besides, he acquainted himself with the everyday 
life of the Indian Army and praised its combat preparedness, 
professionalism and the skill of its generals, officers and 
soldiers.

  [Text] Tehran January 9 TASS -- Russia and Iran ended 
two-day talks on the Karabakh settlement in Tehran on Sunday [9 
January]. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Sunday, Vladimir 
Kazimirov, 
head of the Russian delegation to the talks, expressed 
satisfaction with the negotiations, stressing that both sides 
consider as inadmissible any attempts to internationalise the 
conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  The participants in the talks agreed to take practical steps 
and act together if need be in order to end the bloodshed and 
stabilise the situation in the war zone. Iran and Russia are 
ready to support constructive moves by international 
organisations and separate countries in this direction, 
Kazimirov said. 
  Over the last two days Kazimirov met with Iranian [Deputy] 
Foreign Minister Mahm'ud Va'ezi and Iranian Foreign Ministry 
department for the CIS and the Caucasus Morteza Bank. [sentence 
as received] 
  Russia is acting as a mediator in the conflict settlement in 
the disputed enclave. It channels its efforts in several 
directions: Mediation proper, activities within the framework of 
the Minsk talks of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, as well as active contacts with the states interested in 
ending the bloodshed because of their geographical closeness to 
the war zone, Kazimirov said. 
  "Within this context we continue enhancing mutual 
understanding with Iran, whose borders are now close to the war 
as never before," Kazimirov said. 
  He stressed that the talks have revealed the closeness of 
the 
two countries' approaches to and assessments of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. An agreement has been reached to 
maintain regular contacts and take concrete steps to resolve the 
conflict. 
  Kazimirov noted that Russia will continue "persistent" 
mediatory efforts in order to reach a concrete and binding 
agreement on ceasefire and termination of hostilities. This 
will pave the way for solving many other problems caused by the 
conflict, including the withdrawal of troops from the occupied 
territories, the return of refugees to the places of their 
permanent residence, resumption of transport services and energy 
supplies, and acceleration of the negotiation process on the 
whole. 
  Kazimirov's visit has been initiated by the Russian side, 
following a new aggravation of the conflict. The Russian envoy 
is expected to leave Tehran on Monday.

  [Text] Moscow January 9 TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry has worked out a special programme to protect the 
rights of Russians living in other countries, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Sergey Lavrov said. 
  Speaking on Russian television on Sunday, Lavrov said that 
the programme will be submitted to the government as soon as the 
sources of its financing are found. 
  He voiced concern about the position of many Russians in 
some 
republics of the former Soviet Union, especially in Latvia and 
Estonia where about 1.5 million Russians are deprived of their 
civil and political rights. 
  He said similar problems face Russians in Central Asian 
republics, including Kazakhstan. Although Russia has friendly 
relations with that republic, the Kazakh Constitution says that 
the Kazakh nation, rather that Kazakhstan's people, will seek to 
restore its statehood. This lends an ethnic flavour to the 
entire concept of statehood of Kazakhstan where Russians and 
Kazakhs account for about 40 per cent of the total each, the 
deputy minister noted. 
  Lavrov said that the idea of dual citizenship is 
encountering 
tremendous difficulties in former Soviet republics. He 
admitted, however, that although dual citizenship will not solve 
all the problems, it may have a positive psychological impact on 
people and help ease tension.

<F P=106> ["Own information" report: "Beware of the Car"] </F>
  [Text] The trial in Chisinau of Russian military personnel 
accused of stealing a car long ago acquired the hallmarks of a 
political trial -- in the same category as those which give 
grounds for maxims like "Politics is a dirty business!" 
  The prosecution is studiously silent about the defendants' 
real "guilt" -- their participation in the protection of polling 
places in Chisinau during the March 1991 USSR referendum banned 
by the local authorities. In the two years they have been kept 
in custody these three officers and one private have been 
punished worse than for murder. They have been kept in Chisinau 
detention centers in health-endangering conditions. On 6 June 
1993 they were even put before the court with traces of beatings 
on their faces. 
  During his imprisonment Major Vladimir Teterin has lost 20 
kg 
and has caught tuberculosis in its open form; several times he 
has coughed up blood. The effects of the skull and brain injury 
and contusion he received in Afghanistan are manifesting 
themselves in Captain Vladimir Gram, the other paratrooper; he 
is plagued by terrible headaches. The health of Major Sergey 
Cherkasov and Private Andrey Khorkov has been wrecked. 
  It would be a mistake to think that the slow killing of 
Russian officers and soldiers was carried out only at a time 
when their fate did not attract public attention. In June the 
court cynically refused to allow Chisinau's N. Pirogov 
Association of Medical Workers to carry out an independent 
medical examination of the detainees. Instead of stopping the 
beatings and giving treatment for tuberculosis and the effects 
of contusion they were sent for psychiatric observation, which 
culminated in a finding as to their sanity. As regards Teterin, 
the detention center doctor issued a piece of paper saying that 
he is healthy and that it is apparently only a question of 
"residual fluctuations in the lungs after a previous bout of 
tuberculosis," as though what was staring him in the face was 
not a man virtually on the brink of death. No appeals to the 
law are of assistance. When asked 23 December by the judge 
whether he had any complaints or statements to register, Maj. 
Cherkasov replied in the negative: "No. Complaints are useless 
because they don't give a damn about them here." 
  Representatives of public human rights organizations 
continue 
to be amazed by the cynicism of the people staging this court 
spectacle. First, for some reason a military tribunal is trying 
people who have never served in the Moldovan Army. Second, the 
judge, Captain Vladimir Timofti, is clearly trying to drag out 
the court examination. On 22 December the court session was 
canceled on a humorous pretext: The judge deemed the tribunal's 
corridors too narrow to allow such dangerous criminals as the 
alleged car thieves to be led along them. The next day the 
corridors evidently seemed wider to the judge, but the 
defendants -- each of them -- were brought under an escort of 
two men armed with submachine guns and dogs. The entrance to 
the tribunal was guarded by an entire platoon with assault 
rifles. Who was the judge trying to impress? 
  At the session Maj. Teterin refused to give evidence, 
demanding medical aid. The court's aim, Maj. Cherkasov stated, 
is to discredit the Russian Army and portray the Russian 
military as criminals. He bluntly accused the court of carrying 
out the government's orders and refused to recognize it. 
  Capt. Gram expressed his solidarity with Cherkasov. He 
demanded that an expert medical examination be made and accused 
the detention center organs of treating the defendants brutally. 
Every time I make statements the court does not like, he said, 
I am transferred to conditions fit only for cattle, to a cellar, 
to a cell in which 30 instead of 10 people are kept. Citing his 
grave state of health, the captain refused to give evidence to 
the court. It is hard to think of the military prosecutor as a 
person who has not been initiated into the covert essence of the 
"case," but having seen the defendants even he echoed the 
defense's demand for them to be medically examined. The judge 
refused on this occasion too, placing the attorneys in a state 
of disarray. Viktor Magnushev, a Russian jurist and 
representative of the Congress of Russian Communities, expressed 
doubt about the advisability of his participating in the trial 
given such an attitude by the court toward the defense's 
arguments. 
  The Chisinau press is full of tearful bleating about the 
trial in Tiraspol of a group of Moldovan Ministry of National 
Security terrorists which killed two Dniester region 
politicians. In two years no information about Moldovan 
Justice's outrage against the persons of Russian military 
personnel has found its way onto the pages of local newspapers. 
The Russian Defense Ministry and the Russian judicial organs, 
not to mention the Foreign Ministry, are apparently concerned 
only with searching for a reason to cast four Russian soldiers 
to the mercy of fate and Chisinau officialdom. The Dniester 
region press has already expressed the suspicion that the 
Chisinau leadership regards S.A. Cherkasov, V.Ye. Teterin, A.M. 
Khorkov, and V.A. Gram as hostages, intending to exchange them 
for the murderers convicted in Tiraspol. No denials from 
Moldova have been forthcoming. 
  "Anything goes in relation to Russians! The West will 
approve of everything we are going to do against Russians!" 
These slogans, which for five years now have been quietly 
voiced in editions of pro-Romanian newspapers and sometimes in 
local corridors of power, can be read between the false lines of 
the indictments and the admissions obtained by the investigation 
by recourse to threats and violence. Only a firm word from 
Moscow can stop what are in many respects reprisals which have 
already been carried out against Russian military personnel. 
Are the Russian power structures capable of doing this? The 
Russian soldiers in the Chisinau torture chamber continue to 
hope so.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kosarev article: "Russia Must Take Its Place in </F>
the Arms Market. Thoughts Inspired by the Results of the 
`Lima-93' International Naval and Aerospace Exhibition"] 
  [Text] Dozens of arms exhibitions are held in the world 
every year. It is symbolic that the largest of them (the Abu 
Dhabi exhibition of arms and military hardware) was held at the 
beginning of 1993, while the second most important one (the 
"Lima-93" international naval and aerospace exhibition on the 
Malaysian island of Langkawi) marked the end of the year. 
  For Russian defense industry workers both exhibitions were 
landmarks and were even unprecedented, above all because 
practically all our leading enterprises, scientific research 
institutes, and design bureaus engaged in designing and 
producing weapons were represented there for the first time, 
along with their latest products, including those stemming from 
conversion. It was these exhibitions that gave specialists an 
opportunity to judge the place that Russia holds on the world 
arms market and how successful our attempts have been to counter 
such arms suppliers as the United States, Britain, and France in 
a very fierce competitive struggle. 
  In recent years Russia, in the grip of political 
confrontation, has lost many of its priorities, including those 
in the sphere of arms production and the arms trade. Since 1990 
we have seen an almost fivefold reduction in arms exports. 
Market laws are particularly severe in this specific sphere of 
trade: Russia has reduced arms sales, and other countries have 
sharply increased production and at once filled the vacuum. The 
United States today controls more than 50 percent of world arms 
exports. So under these conditions the Russians' decision to 
participate so extensively in exhibitions was justified 
politically and economically, although to a considerable degree 
it was also risky. Russian defense industry workers -- above 
all, the organizers of our exhibit -- felt the tough pressure 
from competitors back during preparations for the exhibitions. 
  Tribute must be paid to the specialists of the 
"Oboroneksport" Russian State Foreign Economic Association for 
Exports of Military Products and Services who, working in close 
contact with representatives of the Ministry of Defense, made a 
thorough study of the regions where exhibitions are held and of 
the interests of potential buyers. The best of what we have was 
shown both in the Emirates and in Malaysia. The S-300PMU-1 and 
S-300V, Igla, and Tor-M1 antiaircraft missile complexes and 
systems, the Piranya and Triton small and miniature [malyy i 
sverkhmalyy] submarines, and the Ka-50 combat helicopter were 
the real sensation of the exhibitions. 
  The aviation section of the Malaysian exhibition was 
probably 
the most interesting. Some 300 major aviation companies 
presented their products -- everything that holds leading 
positions in the aviation world. The Russian exhibit appeared 
highly impressive against this background. 
  Whereas our country demonstrated just one Ruslan and one 
MiG-29 fighter at the previous exhibition in Malaysia, we took 
four MiG-29's, two Su-27's, and also the MiG-31 long-range 
fighter-interceptor to "Lima-93." At the same time all the 
aircraft and airmen arrived straight from the ranks, as it were 
-- from combat air units -- and had not made any special 
preparation for the exhibition. Under a blazing sun (up to 40 
degrees in the shade) our military engineers and technicians 
prepared the MiG's in just two days, exceeding all existing 
norms. 
  The demonstration flights began right after the official 
opening of the exhibition, and our military airmen participated 
in each of them: Colonels Aleksandr Kutuzov and Vladimir 
Bazhenov, Lieutenant Colonels Boris Grigoryev, Vladimir Gryzlov, 
and Aleksandr Lichkun, and Majors Aleksey Sherstnev, Andrey 
Makarenko, and Aleksandr Katashinskiy, displaying brilliant 
skill in very complex aerobatics figures and eliciting the 
admiration of onlookers and specialists and the envy of foreign 
colleagues. "Selfless work by airmen with excellent hardware." 
This is not my assessment -- this was what the foreign press 
wrote about our airmen. 
  Among the conversion output of defense enterprises 
specialists and businessmen showed special interest in the 
passenger surface-effect vehicles developed by the Central 
Design Bureau for Hydrofoils (Nizhniy Novgorod), in the 
underwater excursion craft created by St. Petersburg's "Rubin" 
Central Design Bureau for Marine Equipment, and in helicopters 
and launches which can be used for sea patrols, rescue 
operations, and services to island resorts. It is only to be 
regretted that for purely economic reasons these exhibits were 
shown in the form of models and photographs and not in real 
life. Incidentally, all the recreational vessels were sold out 
at the previous "Lima-91" exhibition before it ended. 
  Journalists expect sensations from exhibitions. The 
Emirates' purchase of a large consignment of French Leclerc 
tanks was named as the sensation at "IDEX-93 in the United Arab 
Emirates, and at the "Lima-93" exhibition it was the contract to 
supply Malaysia with eight F/A-18 fighters, whereas the contract 
with Russia, which has long been in preparation, to supply the 
Malaysians with 18 MiG-29's was not signed. In my view the 
reasons for this are not commercial but purely political. This 
is particularly obvious in the context of the results of the 
conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
Organization held in Seattle before the exhibition itself. We 
know that the ASEAN countries are the fourth largest source of 
imports to the United States and stand in sixth place among 
America's export markets. In 1992 the volume of U.S. trade with 
them amounted to $60 billion, while U.S. investments in these 
states topped $16 billion. The Americans held the conference 
with great pomp, making it their main aim to turn APEC into a 
disciplined organization capable of ensuring the expansion of 
trade and investments in the Asia-Pacific region. The first 
major obstacle to face them on this path was the refusal by 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed to participate in the 
Seattle meeting. The main reason for the boycott was the 
reluctance to turn APEC into a means of U.S. domination over the 
countries of Southeast Asia. In the opinion of experts, 
Malaysia's purchase of U.S. fighters is a kind of goodwill 
gesture or an attempt at reconciliation with the United States. 
According to other assessments, Malaysia deliberately acquires 
military hardware from different countries, so "limiting these 
countries' opportunity for dictating terms and influencing 
Malaysia's policy." 
  The contract with Russia for MiG-29's is still at the 
elaboration stage. "There is only a small holdup," Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamed assured journalists, "and the 
champagne can already be ordered." I would like to hope that 
the skill of the Russian military airmen and the quality of our 
combat hardware demonstrated at the Malaysian exhibition will be 
a weighty factor in the competitive struggle with Western 
aircraft companies and a good argument in favor of signing the 
contract. But its birth pangs demand a thorough analysis and 
exacting assessments. The BROOKINGS REVIEW, published by the 
Brookings Institution in Washington, carried an analysis of 
Russian arms exports. It describes with heavy irony the history 
of the preparation of the MiG-29 contract. It reports, in 
particular, that representatives of 18 different intermediary 
organizations, each of which claimed to have the right to sell 
these aircraft, visited Malaysia within a short space of time. 
The competition that developed among the Russians created chaos 
and substantially undermined their positions in the negotiations. 
  Until recently "Oboroneksport" was the head organization 
with 
the right to sell Russian weapons. With offices in 40 
countries, it supplied abroad almost 90 percent of all the 
weapons exported by Russia. Recently the "Spetsvneshtekhnika" 
GVK [expansion unknown], the Main Administration for Cooperation 
and Collaboration, and "Promeksport" have been trading in 
weapons. Other organizations, including the manufacturing 
plants, have also sought the right to sell weapons, frequently 
competing but more frequently hindering each other in the 
conclusion of contracts. Shortly before the opening of the 
Malaysian exhibition the Russian Federation president signed an 
edict setting up the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company for Exports 
and Imports of Arms and Military Hardware on the basis of 
"Oboroneksport," "Spetsvneshtekhnika," and the Main 
Administration for Cooperation and Collaboration. The ink on 
the edict was not dry before a mighty wave of criticism crashed 
down on it in the press in full accordance with our Russian 
traditions. A group of very famous arms producers even proposed 
suspending the president's edict. 
  Be that as it may, a desire to instill order in the arms 
trade and to elaborate a state concept of military exports can 
be seen behind the new presidential act. Only it is important 
that all the innovations do not end in an elementary shakeup of 
the former systems in order to satisfy somebody's ambitions, and 
that the tremendous experience accumulated by "Oboroneksport" 
over the 40 years of its existence and the unique cadres it has 
reared are fully employed when the new mechanism is created. 
  We have only just realized the importance to Russia of arms 
exports and learned to ignore the preaching about the immorality 
of the arms trade which only recently was issuing both from the 
pages of the press and from parliamentary rostrums. I remember 
how Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation minister of 
defense who headed the Russian delegation at the Abu Dhabi 
exhibition, was forced to explain to our own Russian journalists 
that we do not seek to sell weapons to just anyone to be used in 
combat operations of an offensive nature or in order to upset 
the balance of forces in a region. We offer military output in 
strict accordance with international laws for defensive 
purposes. "Commerce will not conflict with politics but will 
ensure the achievement of Russia's political and economic ends." 
  It is not only the destinies of millions of working people 
in 
the military-industrial complex and our economic revival that 
depend on whether our country returns to the world arms market 
and on how successful our arms business is -- the fate of Russia 
itself also depends on this.

  [Text] The Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission 
proposes to the people and leadership of the Chechen Republic 
that they examine and resolve positively the question of the 
Chechen Republic's participation in the elections to the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly in March 1994. 
  In accordance with the Russian Federation Constitution, the 
Chechen Republic was and still is a fully equal component 
[subyekt] of Russia and must by rights be worthily represented 
in the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. 
  By means of their active stance and their daily dialogue 
with 
colleagues from other parts of Russia the newly elected Federal 
Assembly deputies from the Chechen Republic could make an 
appreciable contribution to eliminating the problems that exist 
today. 
  For its part the Russian Federation Central Electoral 
Commission is ready to provide organizational and financial 
backup in holding the elections to the Federal Assembly from the 
Chechen Republic. 
  We are convinced that, given good will and the desire for 
happiness and prosperity for the peoples of our common 
multinational motherland -- Russia -- a second appeal on this 
question will elicit understanding and a positive decision from 
the people and the leadership of the Chechen Republic.

Central Electoral Commission 
  [Dated] 5 January 1994 
  The elections of deputies of the Federation Council and the 
State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly were not 
held in the Chechen Republic 12 December 1993. 
  For the purposes of ensuring the right, provided for in the 
Russian Federation Constitution, of citizens of the Russian

and to elect and be elected to federal organs of state power, 
the Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission decrees: 
  The elections of the deputies of the Federation Council of 
the Russian Federation Federal Assembly in the No. 20 two-seat

  [Text] We have received a statement from the press service 
of the permanent representation of Ingushetia under the Russian 
president. It says that one month has elapsed since the Russian 
president signed the edict on the procedure of returning 
refugees and forced migrants to their permanent places of 
residence on the territories of the Republics of North Ossetia 
and Ingushetia. 
  According to this edict, the first stage of the return of 
deported Ingush citizens to their permanent places of residence 
was due to begin last December. However, the Russian 
president's edict has not been implemented. The statement says 
that leaders of the Republic of Ingushetia have often expressed 
their readiness to sit down at the negotiating table with 
leaders of North Ossetia. However, the latter have a negative 
attitude to such statements. The statement also says that those 
who hamper the implementation of the Russian president's edict 
will bear full responsibility for the potential consequences of 
such a policy. This statement is signed by Ingushetia's 
President Ruslan Aushev.

  [Text] In a statement for media, President Ruslan Aushev of 
Ingushetia accuses North Ossetia's leadership of ignoring 
President Yeltsin's decree to bring back the refugees who were 
forced to leave their homes since 1992 when hostilities between 
Ossetia and Ingushetia began. 
  "Although the decree was signed almost a month ago, it has 
not been implemented", Aushev stressed. 
  He also drew attention to the fact that his administration 
had repeatedly voiced readiness to sit down at the negotiating 
table with North Ossetian leaders to work out mutually 
acceptable mechanisms of fulfilling the presidential decree to 
guarantee the full safety of the two republics citizens. 
"Regrettably, our appeals to the North Ossetian leadership have 
evoked a negative response", Aushev said. 
  All of this, in his words, has been least conducive for 
stability and has been discrediting the federal authorities and 
the newly adopted constitution. "I believe that responsibility 
for possible consequences rests with those who obstructs the 
presidential decree", the statement says. 
  In cables to Russia's Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik 
and 
to the Central Electoral Commission's Chairman Nikolay Ryabov, 
Aushev stressed that more than 60,000 deported Ingushes - 
citizens of North Ossetia - cannot return to their homes and 
are deprived of the constitutional right to take part in 
presidential elections scheduled for January 16 in North 
Ossetia. "If voting takes place without them, election results 
cannot be recognized as valid", the messages say. A request is 
made to send legal experts to North Ossetia to monitor the 
election campaign and the course of presidential elections in 
line with Russia's constitution.

  [Text] The Chairman of the North Ossetian Council of 
Ministers Sergey Khetagurov intends to ask the republic's 
Interior Ministry to clarify circumstances behind the murder in 
the summer of 1993 of Viktor Polyanichko, head of the temporary 
authority on the territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
Khetagurov made the statement Sunday addressing a news 
conference in Vladikavkaz. 
  The statement was caused by the article in the 
MEGAPOLIS-EXPRESS weekly, which says about the the North 
Ossetian prime minister's complicity to Polyanichko's 
assassination. Khetagurov characterized the publication as an 
outrageous statement which deliberately appeared during the 
election campaign in North Ossetia and Khetagurov stands for 
presidency. 
  The statement by the MEGAPOLIS-EXPRESS weekly was denied at 
the news conference in Vladikavkaz by a senior official of the 
criminal department at the Russian Interior Ministry, Lieutenant 
General Vladimir Kolesnichenko.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 9 Jan -- A statement by Ingushetia's 
President Ruslan Aushev to the effect that North Ossetia is 
hampering the implementation of the Russian president's decree 
on the procedure for the return of refugees has provoked a 
negative reaction from the North Ossetian leadership. 
  Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of North 
Ossetia, today sent a telegram to Boris Yeltsin expressing 
categorical disagreement with the assertions of the Ingush 
president. The position of the Ingush president is described as 
a "desire to draw the federal authorities into resolving the 
complex refugee problem by force, to destabilize the situation 
and hamper the normal process of preparing for and holding 
elections for president of the Republic of North Ossetia on 16 
January." 
  "Attempts to impose conditions from the outside while 
resolving internal matters of our republic," the telegram says, 
"are leading to the disruption of the difficult negotiating 
process of settling the relations between the peoples of the 
neighboring republics and are aggravating the situation in North 
Caucasus."

  [Text] Sergey Levushkin, head of the Koryak Autonomous 
Okrug, on 4 January approved the decree which sets the date and 
ratifies the statute for the election of deputies to the okrug 
Duma. Elections are set for 6 March 1994. The voters of the 
Koryak Okrug are to elect eight deputies to the okrug Duma, two 
deputies from each rayon, who will work on a full time basis. 
  The decree of the okrug electoral commission establishes the 
okrug electoral districts, some of which will be territorial, 
and others, national. The composition of the rayon electoral 
commissions is to be submitted for approval before 14 January. 
The commissions will prepare and conduct the election of 
deputies to the okrug Duma. It is presumed that the elections 
will be conducted according to the same procedure as for the 
Federal Assembly of Russia. So, on this occasion, the Koryak 
Autonomous Okrug is behaving like a member of the Russian 
Federation ensuring independent economic and cultural 
development in the territory.

  [Text] Yuzho-Sakhalinsk January 9 TASS -- The Sakhalin and 
Kuril islands expect a growth in political activity in the 
second half of the winter, due to elections to the new regional 
parliament, scheduled for March 20 1993. 
  In accordance with Regional Governor Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov's 
order, the parliament will consist of two chambers, the Regional 
Council and the Regional Duma. The council will consist of 17 
deputies who will continue to hold their regular jobs while 
fulfilling their representative functions. The duma will 
consist of 13 full-time representatives. 
  Local observers predict, with a few reservations, that the 
March elections will be similar to the national December 
elections in that most of the islanders will vote primarily for 
the person, not his party or his programme. It would not be 
surprising if most of the seats in the regional council go to 
leading figures in the municipal and regional administrations or 
their proteges. 
  In contrast to the upcoming electoral activity, the 
political 
thermometer on the Sakhalin and Kuril islands has been around 
zero for the past five months. The few representatives of 
different parties, blocs, and movements have had practically no 
effect on the lives of the islanders.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASs -- The presidential decree 
"on the structure of federal authorities of the executive 
branch," which both journalists and many members of the 
government were so eager to see, was signed by Boris Yeltsin 
today. While the decree was being drafted, both the president 
and the prime minister pointed out that it was aimed, in the 
first place, at improving the efficiency of the government's 
work, the reduction of its staff and of the number of ministries 
and agencies. 
  As was expected, only cosmetic changes were made in the 
government structure: The number of ministries was reduced from 
about 30 to 23, a number of state committees were merged with 
others or transformed into ministries and federal services. 
From now on, the government will include 24 state committees 
and 20 federal services and departments. 
  It is noteworthy that, according to the decree, some federal 
agencies, specifically the Defence Ministry, the Interior 
Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the external intelligence and 
counter- intelligence services, the main guards department, the 
government communication and information agency, the archive 
service, the TV and radio broadcasting service are subordinated 
to the president. 
  The decree leaves open the question of who will be 
second-in- 
command in the government. The only thing the decree says is 
that there will be four deputy prime ministers instead of nine. 
Two of them will be first deputy prime ministers. The decree 
suggests that "the chairman of the Russian Government shall 
nominate within a week candidates for first deputy chairmen and 
deputy chairmen of the Russian Government, as well as federal 
ministers." 
  Oleg Soskovets and Yegor Gaydar now have the greatest 
chances 
of becoming first deputy prime ministers, ITAR-TASS learned from 
reliable government sources. So far as the remaining two 
candidates are concerned, the situation is not clear. Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, now in charge of the agricultural sector of the 
national economy, may become one of them. According to the 
sources, it is quite probable that Boris Fedorov, now deputy 
prime minister and minister of finance, will become the fourth 
deputy prime minister. His chances are fifty-fifty. Fedorov 
gained the reputation of a skillful politician thanks to his 
open polemics with Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin and 
the chairman of the Central Bank. 
  And still, this forecast of the government official about 
Fedorov may be wrong, because it is doubtful that the minister 
of finance will be able to find a common language with Chairman 
of the Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko, who enjoys the support 
of Viktor Chernomyrdin and shows no intention of leaving his 
post. 
  Those who are now deputy prime ministers will hardly be left 
without high posts, this time in the Federal Assembly. Most 
probably, this will happen to Vladimir Shumeyko and Sergey 
Shakhray. As for Anatoliy Chubays, the Russian privatization 
supremo, he is expected to retain only the post of chairman of 
the State Property Committee. 
  The fact that Yeltsin signed the decree on the 
reorganisation 
of the government today, of all days, is important for one more 
reason: Contrary to all forecasts, he did it before the 
beginning of the work of the Federal Assembly. Instead of 
gaining some political advantages by signing the document after 
the parliament starts working, Yeltsin decided to take this step 
today. This shows that the president is set to maintain 
"tough-constructive" relations between the executive branch and 
the lawmakers, and is going to build relations with the new 
parliament, proceeding, in the first place, from the broad 
powers given to him by the new constitution.

<F P=106> [By correspondent A. Dubnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Representatives of the newly reconstituted Federal 
Counterintelligence Service held a news conference today at the 
Foreign Ministry's press center in Moscow. On 5 January 1994, 
an edict of the Russian president endorsed the service's 
standing orders which, according to its deputy director Sergey 
Stepashin, was an expected surprise [as heard] for its members. 
  The new structure is not a copy of the disbanded Security 
Ministry but makes the service answerable directly to the 
president, as is the practice in many other countries. Its 
remit covers such important matters as identification, advance 
warning, and prevention of subversive and intelligence 
activities directed against the Russian Federation by foreign 
special services and organizations; supply of intelligence 
information on threats to Russia; the fight against terrorism, 
illegal trading in weapons and narcotic substances, and illegal 
armed groups; and also counterintelligence support to ensure the 
security of Russian borders. This is despite the fact that the 
border troops have reorganized into a separate federal service 
with ministry status. 
  One thing worth pointing out is that the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service's manpower has been cut by 46 
percent and will total 75,000 persons. The number of 
administrators has been more than halved. 
  In the new structure, the main emphasis is on strengthening 
the counterintelligence and the anti-terrorism departments. 
  So, this notorious power structure has undergone yet another 
overhaul. Time will show how effective this one will be.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 8 TASS -- Less than a month after the 
parliamentary elections in Russia, centrists led by Vladimir 
Voronin have begun tossing up the question of early presidential 
elections this coming summer. 
  Commenting on their calls, Georgiy Satarov, an adviser to 
President Boris Yeltsin, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS on 
Saturday [8 January] that under the new Russian Constitution 
"the president of the Russian Federation... As of the day this 
constitution enters into force shall execute his powers 
established thereof until the expiration of his term of office 
for which he has been elected." 
  This provision can be changed by two thirds of the state 
Duma, two thirds of the Federation Council and as many of the 
subjects of the federation. Additionally, attempts to question 
the will of the voters by any party would mean disrespect for 
their opinion, Satarov said. 
  At the same time, Satarov, who also heads the Russian Social 
and Political Centre which groups over 20 parties, believes that 
the "state, if it is interested in normal communication with 
society, should provide material support to all political 
parties irrespective of their political orientation because it 
is the parties that perform the function of such communication." 
If the state intends to maintain the dialogue with society, it 
should find out, with the help of parties, and take into account 
public interests in its policy, Satarov added. 
  He noted that as far as multi-party system is concerned, "we 
are still living by the old Soviet legislation which does not 
differentiate between the types of public organisations." 
According to Satarov they are divided into three groups. 
Political parties are one of them. "Because they (political 
parties) participate in the formation of such important 
substance as power, political parties should be absolutely 
`transparent' for society and the state," he said. In other 
words, citizens have the right to know what goals are pursued by 
such parties, who finances them and how they spend their money. 
Under the current legislation, this cannot be found out because 
it is impossible to differentiate between political parties and 
non-political organisations. 
  Apart from political parties, there are also non-political 
organisations in Russia, including human rights, youth, children 
organisations and others. "The state can and should effectively 
use such organisations to pursue its policy, for example provide 
support for the family, victims of repressions and so on." 
Satarov believes that these organisations would carry out their 
functions and use state funds more effectively than the 
structures within the presidential administration. 
  "In all civilised countries the state tries to hand over 
such 
functions to public organisations," Satarov noted, stressing 
that the state should retain the right to control their 
expenditures. 
  Additionally, there are sort of interest clubs which unite 
philatelists, dog owners, plant growers and others. They act 
independently from the state and solve their problems on their 
own. 
  Satarov emphasised that "there should be three different 
legislations for different public organisations." But in Russia 
which has no normal civil society, its formation cannot be left 
without the participation of the state. The Russian Social and 
Political Centre has been established as a means of the state's 
participation in this process. As a state structure, the centre 
provides information and analytical materials to all branches of 
power. Recently, Satarov appealed to President Boris Yeltsin, 
urging him to work out a new legislation applicable to different 
types of parties and public organisations and taking into 
account the new realities of Russian life.

  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- On the eve of the first 
parliament session presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov 
warned communists against launching attacks on the president and 
the Constitution and added that the president wants to 
constructively work with the legislature. 
  Kostikov told a briefing on Monday [10 January] that there 
are signs that communists are planning to launch attacks on the 
president and the new Constitution in parliament thus resuming 
what the former anti-Yeltsin legislature had failed to complete. 
  "Unfortunately, according to information which we possess, 
there are big fears that some factions, in particular the 
communists, are getting ready for attacks on the government, the 
president. We have all grounds to expect that attacks on the 
new Constitution will be launched", he said. 
  Kostikov called on communist leaders to remember "the bloody 
trace left by communists and learn lessons from it" while 
criticising the young Russian democracy and accusing the 
president of dictatorship. 
  "On the eve of the first session of the State Duma I would 
like to recall the tragic events connected with the bolshevik 
history", he said referring, in particular, to the 
anti-Bolshevik uprising in the fortress of Kronstadt in 1921 
which was drowned in blood. 
  On Monday the Russian president decreed to rehabilitate the 
soldiers and navymen who were executed during and after the 
anti-Bolshevik uprising. 
  Kostikov said the president wants that cooperation with Duma 
goes calmly and constructively. "Tomorrow a new page of the 
Russian democracy begins and we are all interested that this 
stage of cooperation of the president, the government with the 
legislature is quiet and constructive", he stressed adding that 
the executive authority would "keep a close eye on the 
behaviour" of all parliamentary groups.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Lillevyali from Moscow; from the "Vesti" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The communist faction, one of the largest factions 
of the new parliament, held a working meeting seminar in the 
Moscow parliamentary center today in the run up to the start of 
the work of the parliament. 
  [Correspondent] On the agenda of the meeting which was held 
behind closed doors were issues connected with the running of 
the State Duma. During the very first days of the work of the 
parliament's lower chamber the communist deputies intend to give 
a political assessment of the October 1993 events in Moscow and 
of the referendum on the new constitution. 
  Replying to a question about the election of the State Duma 
chairman, Deputy Viktor Zorkaltsev said that the four largest 
factions: Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Russia's Choice, 
Communists, and the Agrarians have decided not to put their 
candidates forward for the position of speaker. He underscored 
that if a faction is powerful enough it can exert its influence 
in other ways. That is why representatives of the four largest 
factions have decided to allow a candidate from the smallest 
factions run for the post of chairman of the chamber. 
  [Zorkaltsev] The largest factions will put forward their 
candidates for the positions of deputy chairmen. In all there 
will be candidates for chairman and four deputy chairmen and 
they should be put to the vote as a package. Resolving that 
issue in this way provides an opportunity to elect the 
leadership of the Duma in a matter of a few hours, to elect and 
approve the composition of the Duma committees, and elect the 
leadership of those committees without having to drag out the 
resolution of the organizational matters for two to three months 
as used to be the case in the past. 
  [Lillevyali] According to Zorkaltsev, the main bone of 
contention to emerge in the Duma will concern the accomodation 
of the Duma and not the election of the speaker.

  [Text] The Russia's Choice bloc has suspended its 
participation in the negotiations held by the leaders of the 
State Duma's factions. Members of the bloc's executive 
committee and representatives of Russia's Choice in the deputies 
commissions, who are members of the organizational committee to 
prepare the State Duma's work, made this decision on Thursday 
evening. 
  Commenting this decision for INTERFAX, Yegor Gaydar's aide 
explained position of Russia's Choice bloc's leader on this 
issue. He said that despite the unacceptability to cooperate 
with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, at the request of 
small parliamentary factions the bloc had participated in the 
negotiations because it believes that it should use any chance 
for a constructive work of the State Duma. 
  However, as Gaydar's aide said, in the course of the 
negotiations on the future chairman of the State Duma, his 
deputies and chairmen of the parliamentary committees, opponents 
of Russia's Choice bloc tried to prolong the time because at 
every sitting they offered new candidacies to replace those 
approved the day before. 
  It has become obvious, he said, that "a tripartite bloc," 
consisting of Liberal Democratic Party, Communist party, and 
Agrarian Party of Russia, has formed in the process of the 
negotiations which has started to divide the posts of 
parliamentary committees' leaders. According to their plans, 
representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party must head, in 
particular, the committee on international affairs and defense, 
representatives of the communist party -- committees on state 
security and economic policy, and a representative of the 
Agrarian party -- a committee on constitutional legislature and 
legal reform. 
  Under this situation the Russia's Choice bloc has decided 
that it will not participate in such a division of the State 
Duma and make it legal as it is prematurely a non-constrcutive 
one. Simultaneously Russia's Choice called the State Duma's 
democratic factions, that is, all factions except the Liberal 
Democratic Party, Communist party, and Agrarian party to hold 
active consultations in order to adopt decisions which would 
promote for the constrcutive work of the State Duma. 
  "It will not take much time if there is a mutual wish to 
find 
a coordinated decision," said INTERFAX interlocutor. In his 
words, Russia's Choice views the principle according to which 
representative of one of the small factions must become chairman 
of the State Duma and representatives of Russia's Choice, 
Liberal Democratic Party, Communist party, and Agrarian party - 
his deputies as "rather doubtful because it does not take into 
account interests of small factions." 
  According to Gaydar's aide, Russia's Choice would agree to 
see either Alevtina Fedulova (leader of Russia's Women bloc), or 
first deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin or Vladimir 
Lukin, both representing Yavlinskiy's bloc, on the post of the 
chairman of the State Duma. 
  Yegor Gaydar's aide also reported that in the course of a 
two-day working conference held by the members of the bloc on 
January 5-6, the Russia's Choice bloc had discussed the bloc's 
tactics in the Duma and working documents to be submitted to the 
parliament by Russia's Choice. 
  Russia's Choice wants to propose to the State Duma to go 
through the organizational stage as soon as possible and to 
concentrate its efforts on the law making work. However, "the 
situation is being painfully worsening," said INTERFAX 
interlocutor.

  [Text] In his interview with Interfax on Friday [7 
January] Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Central Executive 
Committee of Russia's Communist Party, declared that the 
unwillingness of the bloc Russia's Choice to participate in the 
negotiations on the speaker of the State Duma, as declared the 
bloc's leader Yegor Gaydar, does not mean that the ongoing 
consultations would be concluded. 
  In his opinion, representatives of the Russia's Choice bloc 
"cannot come to ourselves" after the large defeat at the 
December 12 elections. Zyuganov believes that Russia's Choice 
does not understand that its influence in the parliament, in 
contrast to executive power bodies, is not a dominating one and 
it "will have to take into account" other political forces as 
well. 
  In Zyuganov's words, in the course of the negotiations the 
Communist Party will defend interests of all factions, including 
the Russia's Choice. Zyuganov called a compromise variant which 
was considered at the negotiations, namely when representatives 
of each of eight factions will head one key parliamentary 
committee (there are correspondingly eight committees).

  [Text] Commenting the Russia's Choice bloc decision to 
suspend its participation in negotiations, deputy of the State 
Duma Gennadiy Burbulis, one of the leaders of Russia's Choice, 
said in his interview with Interfax on Saturday [8 January] that 
in the course of negotiations between leaders of the State 
Duma's factions there appeared two extremist radical groupings. 
The Russia's Choice bloc believes that it is not only 
"fruitless" but also "unacceptable and dangerous for the public 
conscience" to negotiate with them under the present situation. 
  "One of this grouping is a left-wing radical one made up of 
representatives of the ideology of the Soviet, namely communist 
period of the Russian history," said Burbulis. The question 
concerns the parliamentary factions of Russia's communist party 
and agrarian party, he explained. The second right-wing radical 
grouping is represented by the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia which "openly propagates national fascist ideas," 
believes Burbulis. 
  "All constructive proposals set forth by Russia's Choice 
confronts self-mercenary interests of there two radical 
groupings," he said. 
  In Burbulis' opinion, continuation of negotiations with 
these 
two extremely radical forces could lead to the oblivion of those 
strategic goals for the sake of which the Russia's Choice bloc 
has been formed and of those positions which its candidates have 
defended in the course of the pre-election campaign. 
  The deputies elected from the bloc Russia's Choice, Burbulis 
continued, strive "to ensure stability in the country without 
deviating from the principal course aimed at deep democratic 
transformations in Russia." 
  Burbulis believes that the participation of Russia's Choice 
in the negotiations probably has been a demonstration of its 
"political shortsightedness." 
  In the course of the negotiations, Burbulis said, "appetites 
of extremist radical factions have grown into the claims to head 
key parliamentary committees, including the committee on 
international affairs, defense, security, legislature, and 
financial-economic committees." 
  While commenting the intention of the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to head the 
international affairs committee, Burbulis declared that "it 
should not take place under any situation." "This will be an 
appeal to other countries to defend and to move away from Russia 
again though the latter has demonstrated that it is ready for a 
comprehensive and useful integration into the world community," 
said Burbulis. 
  When asked whether the faction Russia's Choice does not fear 
to appear in the minority, Burbulis answered: "It is more 
dangerous for us to loose our positions in the society and 
confidence of our electors." According to Burbulis, position of 
Russia's Choice is well known to the participants of the 
negotiations."

  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- Russia's Choice, one of 
the new Russian parliament's major groups, began an all-night 
vigil on Sunday [9 January], which ended at 01.00 on Monday 
morning, to discuss organisation of its work in the Federal 
Assembly. The meeting elected faction leaders. 
  Yegor Gaydar was elected head of the "Russia's Choice" 
parliamentary faction, a spokesman for the State Duma leadership 
told ITAR-TASS. 
  Boris Zolotukhin, a former people's deputy and a member of 
the Russian Supreme Soviet's democratic wing, was elected the 
deputy head of the group. He will be in charge of the 
legislative work and relations with other parliamentary groups. 
  Anatoliy Chubays, the second deputy, will be responsible for 
ties with the government. Sergey Yushenkov, also a former 
member of the Russian parliament dissolved by President Boris 
Yeltsin last September, will be the faction's senior secretary. 
  The meeting also discussed and approved a programme for the 
first session of the State Duma and the faction's activity. It 
was agreed that any faction member "must vote solidarily" if so 
decided by a two-third majority at the faction's general meeting.

  [Text] Deputies in the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
faction are now holding their first meeting in the Russian 
parliamentary center. In his brief opening speech, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy once again described his party as one of the best 
in Russia. He said that the faction does not intend to enter 
any blocs and that at present it is not interested in what kind 
of republic Russia will become, presidential or parliamentary. 
He also noted that the party stands for reconciliation, 
liberty, and law, and that society should not now be divided 
into communists, blues and greens -- everyone should be equal 
before the law. 
  After this, he asked journalists to leave, saying that 
thereafter, the faction's deputies would be tackling their own 
problems and tasks, which by all appearances we will be learning 
about in the next few days.

  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- The parliamentary group of 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia held its first meeting on 
Monday [10 January]. 
  Journalists displayed great interest in this event, since 
all 
other top party functionaries, apart from LDPR leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, as well as newly elected legislators are, in 
fact, unknown to the public at large. 
  However, despite Zhirinovskiy's assurances of his commitment 
to "openness and freedom of speech", journalists were barred 
from the business part of the meeting. They could only listen 
to a 30-minute speech by the party leader. 
  Zhirinovskiy said that the parliamentary group will consist 
of 64 legislators, 59 of whom were elected on the party list and 
five from one-seat constituencies. According to the LDPR 
leader, the group consists of representatives from "all 
professions, trades and social sections". 
  "The party's position is reconciliation," he said. "The LDPR 
is ready to cooperate with all but will not join blocs or 
agreements with anybody." According to Zhirinovskiy, there are 
"many good lawmakers" among communists and agrarian deputies, 
but they are beset with "negative historic past". 
  As for democratic blocs, Zhirinovskiy said that "there are 
people who treat us well". 
  Although the LDPR supports the new constitution in every 
way, 
regarding it "good for 90 per cent", the party plans to strive 
for creating "a strong parliament along with the strong 
president", the LDPR leader noted. 
  Zhirinovskiy underlined that the LDPR group will lend 
strength to parliament.

  [Text] Today, on the eve of the opening of the Russian 
parliament, we have more than once turned to the vital issue of 
tactics to be pursued by various factions in their work. You 
will now learn what tactics the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia [LDPR] faction is going to pursue in the State Duma. 
Their tactics are described for Mayak by Stanislav Zhebrovskiy, 
a member of the LDPR Supreme Council, the party's deputy 
chairman and a deputy in the State Duma. The recording was made 
on the telephone. 
  [Begin Zhebrovskiy recording] The Liberal Democratic Party 
will operate as a separate faction in the State Duma. This is 
because entering into blocs with someone always means colluding 
against someone else. The Liberal Democratic Party is going to 
the Duma not to wage war against someone, but to work in the 
interests of the state. That is, we stand for doing something 
in the interests of the state every day, and for agreeing to 
compromises. 
  We shall always be a constructive political force. We are in 
opposition to the present government, but, I repeat, it is 
constructive opposition. Our stand is: Whoever proposes a 
sensible law directed at safeguarding Russia's interests, we 
shall always back this law. This is what we mean when we say we 
are constructive. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Vladlen Ginzburg article: "Through the Eyes of a Political </F>
Manager. Election Race Intrigue. Important for Victors and 
Vanquished To Understand Its Implications. Particularly Those 
for Whom Spring Holds an Election Campaign"] 
  [Text] The main sensation in the recent elections is 
deemed to be the success of Zhirinovskiy's party, something that 
came as a surprise to many people. Lively discussion of the 
political, social, psychological, and even psychiatric reasons 
for and possible consequences of the resultant apportionment of 
votes is continuing. Many articles mention in passing the 
special features of a particular bloc's propaganda campaign. 
This is generally said to be a secondary factor with no 
decisive effect on the election results. That is true to some 
extent, but nonetheless for the main participants in the 
election race, had they taken a different approach to the 
election campaign, the results could have been appreciably 
different from those we have now. 
  There is no point in analyzing the features of the election 
campaign conducted by all 13 movements, parties, and blocs. The 
overwhelming majority of these campaigns' organizers displayed 
professional feebleness. The results generally reflect not only 
the political amorphousness and featurelessness of these 
formations, but also their leaders' inability to competently 
plan and organize what Americans call the election race. 
  The fact that V.V. Zhirinovskiy conducted his campaign the 
most professionally played an important role in his success. 
  The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] 
had strict targets for his propaganda. He was perfectly well 
aware on whom he could rely, clearly understood what worries his 
future voters, and deliberately put forward arguments that were 
understandable and appealing to the dregs of society [lyumpeny] 
(with or without a higher education) who form the backbone of 
his electorate. 
  Efficient orchestration of the campaign played a 
considerable 
role. Each of Vladimir Volfovich's speeches was devoted to a 
single issue alone. This enabled him to outline in a thorough 
and at the same time very specific manner ways of resolving all 
the problems that really worry people. 
  The choice of topics for the speeches created a certain 
amount of intrigue and ensured the momentum of the campaign. 
Anyone who started listening to Zhirinovskiy's passionate 
monologues could not wait for the followup, particularly when 
the subject of the next speech was not announced in advance. 
The propaganda campaign followed a rising curve, and, 
evidently, all its reserves were not depleted. The LDPR leader, 
with his inherent modesty, said after the elections that had the 
campaign lasted another 10 days he would have gotten 70 percent 
of the vote. Needless to say, that is an exaggeration, but 
other opportunities for the LDPR to enlarge its electorate did 
exist. The point is that Zhirinovskiy very skillfully and 
purposefully drew broader and broader population groups into his 
orbit. It is not after all only among hoboes that you find 
people who like simple solutions to complex problems. 
  All these and many other means of conducting political 
(primarily election) campaigns are well known to campaign 
specialists and political managers, of which there are fairly 
large numbers in countries with a developed democracy, but which 
still have virtually no representation in our country taking its 
first steps down the road to democratization. 
  Zhirinovskiy's advisers may not be very experienced 
managers. Otherwise it is difficult to account for the 
occasions which deflated his campaign. Video clips, inevitably 
prepared by other people, often strayed from the general 
strategy, proved protracted, and detracted from the exuberant, 
energetic rhythm of the campaign. Appearances on air by members 
of the leader's entourage were even worse -- their image was in 
sharp contrast with that of Zhirinovskiy himself and would have 
been more suitable for featureless political groups incapable of 
making any impression on the voters. 
  Zhirinovskiy's irresponsibility and happy-go-lucky style 
that 
were pointed out by all his critics may quite well have been 
just a skillful election ploy. The nature of the LDPR leader's 
behavior will almost certainly change after the elections, and 
the stunned country will see a fairly respectable, restrained 
legislator who has forgotten most of his fantastic election 
outbursts and, bit by bit, is assembling the political baggage 
for his next electoral surge. The voters who have come to love 
this understandable, accessible politician will willingly 
forgive him certain departures from election promises in the 
realization that this is the cost of the struggle and 
circumstances sometimes make it necessary to switch to gradual 
actions. 
  The election campaign of the "Russia's Choice" bloc was 
conducted at a far lower professional level. One of the main 
principles necessary for success seems to have been infringed. 
In planning the bloc's campaign its organizers were unable to 
work out a fundamental strategy that should have laid down all 
the tactical methods and been the cornerstone of all campaign 
events. The bloc's leading politicians made vigorous use of 
something which was not available to virtually all their 
adversaries, to wit -- their not inconsiderable experience of 
implementing the reforms and the government's definite 
achievements. This strong argument could have been the basis of 
their strategy, but in order for that to be so it should have 
been exploited consistently throughout the campaign. 
  Generally speaking the campaign propaganda material was 
glaringly at variance with this fundamental idea. The exception 
being only the brilliant monologues by E. Pamfilova, the 
speeches by A. Chubays at the end of the campaign, and also 
certain (by no means all!) recordings of Ye. Gaydar's speeches. 
Viewers were most often shown a lyrical video clip with a cute 
kid and an appealing hound that had no connection with the 
presumed strategy. The election campaign lacked purpose, 
integrity, and a single ideological core. Virtually all the 
pieces were good in themselves, but put together the entire 
thing lacked punch. Nor did any of the "Russia's Choice" 
posters, without exception, in the slightest degree accord with 
any unified strategic line. Elegant views accompanied by the 
bloc's emblem were as feeble in backing up its leaders' 
arguments as pop concerts against the backdrop of the selfsame 
emblem. The only poster which in some way accorded with the 
main idea was executed extremely badly. It carried a picture of 
Ye.T. Gaydar in a somewhat affected pose, and the text could 
equally have been interpreted both for and against the bloc. 
  You get the impression that the bloc campaign organizers did 
not entirely know whom they were addressing. The bloc's staunch 
supporters and adversaries did not need this kind of 
campaigning, while for the waverers totally different approaches 
were needed. 
  There is reason to think that a considerable proportion of 
the supporters of democratic reforms, lulled by the cheery 
forecasts of an inevitable victory for "Russia's Choice," did 
not turn out to vote. That is the direct result of the campaign 
organizers' basic incompetence. Any professional manager knows 
that during the last few days before an election the main effort 
should be focused on persuading your supporters to turn out 
without fail. 
  At some point, roughly a week before the election, the 
LDPR's 
growing superiority began to emerge clearly. An emergency 
adjustment to strategy was needed. One main adversary had 
emerged from among the 12. Had the main attack been focused in 
that direction, the gap could have been closed and some of the 
waverers -- those at least who, having voted for Zhirinovskiy, 
have now been frightened by the results -- drawn away from the 
LDPR. Many people would have changed their decision had 
everything now being said about Zhirinovskiy been said then in a 
fairly cogent and serious way -- during the last few days before 
the election. There was no sign of any effort to do this. 
  The results indicate that inadequate use of the factor of 
the real fascist danger was also made during the formation of 
the coalition of democratic forces. For all their 
uncompromising arrogance, all the democratic blocs are now 
resolutely dissociating themselves from the LDPR. Consequently, 
attempts to pool efforts should have been more persistent prior 
to the election rather than now when little can be changed. 
  It is easy to work out how many Duma seats the democrats 
lost 
owing to their disunity if you examine the election results in 
single-seat districts. As far as I know, in one of these 
districts alone -- namely Universitetskiy District No. 201 -- a 
serious attempt was made to avoid splitting the democrat vote. 
A primary election procedure was formulated here and 
coordinated with local democratic organizations, making it 
possible to select a single candidate from democratic 
associations and focus all efforts on supporting him. This was 
the first time such primary elections have been held in Russia. 
They were a success and attracted a large turnout. An 
experienced political manager from the United States, who was 
present during the primary elections as an observer, voiced a 
high opinion of their procedure and organization. It is deeply 
regrettable that the republic leaders of all democratic 
associations without exception did not back this initiative. 
The upshot was that candidates from all three democratic blocs 
vied with one another and an independent candidate, who was 
seeking election with the help of simple forgery, was close to 
success. Fortunately everything turned out OK and the Russian 
Movement for Democratic Reforms candidate was elected, but in 
many districts the fragmented democrats helped their opponents 
win. 
  It should be emphasized that under these conditions it was 
impossible to qualitatively affect the course of the campaign 
and radically alter the result thereof during the voting on 
federal lists. Underlying social and political factors played a 
decisive role, but the quantitative indicators could have been 
different. After all, we now calculate in hundredths of a 
percent. 
  So, what is to be done? 
  The two years' lifespan allotted for the new parliament is a 
short period. Serious politicians, above all reformers from 
"Russia's Choice," must learn from their defeat. As well as 
carrying out an in-depth analysis of the reasons for this defeat 
they must immediately start preparing for the next elections. 
  To this end they must, in particular, begin the immediate 
professional training of party organizers capable of competently 
planning and conducting a national or regional campaign. It is 
also necessary urgently to organize the training of professional 
political managers capable of conducting local campaigns on the 
instructions of party organizers or individual candidates, 
primarily in single-seat districts. Methodological material 
must be based on two sources: on our already fairly extensive 
experience and on foreign experience adapted to fit Russian 
conditions. 
  No one could have expected our country to move smoothly and 
triumphally to a democratic way of life. There will be more 
victories and defeats on this difficult road. We must draw the 
correct conclusions from the palpable defeat suffered by the 
reformers 12 December and start working intensively. That is 
the guarantee of future success!

  [Text] Today at the eastern district prefecture building in 
Moscow, a working conference of the leaders of the Russian 
All-People's Union [RANU] took place. 
  The conference began with a wave of displeasure in the hall 
when the chairwoman attempted to address those in attendance as 
gentlemen. However, this vexing slip of the tongue did not 
affect the course of the meeting. On the agenda were economic 
and political issues as well as the RANU's tasks for the next 
six months. 
  The greater part of a speech by Nikolay Pavlov, one of the 
RANU leaders, was devoted to criticizing the president and the 
government. On the whole, it contained nothing new: the 
accusation that Yeltsin and the government had organized the 
putsch, the dissolution of parliament, the slump in 
manufacturing, corruption and criticism of foreign policy, and 
of the START II treaty in particular. It was asked why so many 
people had perished on October 3-4 if the balance of forces in 
the new parliament will not, in the opinion of RANU members, be 
in favor of those now in power, in so far as former deputies and 
opposition members have once again got into the Duma. [sentence 
as heard] 
  There was, however, recognition that the RANU is an 
insufficiently powerful political force and therefore it has 
been decided to re-register the movement as a party.

  [Text] Moscow January 8 TASS -- A working conference of the 
leaders of the Russian All-People's Union (ROS) has taken place 
in the building of the prefecture of Moscow's eastern district 
on Saturday. 
  The ROS is a right-wing organisation with a great power 
ideology, favouring a highly centralised state and a strong 
executive branch. It was founded in October 1993. 
  The speakers admitted, that the ROS is not yet a powerful 
political force. It did not run with other electoral coalitions 
in the December 1993 elections. Nonetheless, they adopted a 
resolution to register the movement as a party.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In Moscow today, approximately 100--mainly elderly-- 
people picketed near the statue of Karl Marx on Teatralnaya 
Ploshchad in defense of the Lenin Museum and the Mausoleum. 
  Now for another rally held today: 
  [Correspondent Nikolay Ivanov] A rally by the so-called 
Russian All-People's Union was held not far from the White House 
near the stadium at Krasnaya Presnya. The assembled did not 
exceed 2,000 in number. Although the rally was devoted 
officially to the memory of those who died during the defense of 
the White House in October last year, those gathered and the 
speakers easily extended the limits of their speeches. These 
ranged from expressions of dissatisfaction with the Russian 
president and Government to displeasure at the forthcoming visit 
by the U.S. President. 
  Mikhail Astafyev, the well-known opposition leader, pointed 
toward the U.S. Embassy, saying that, according to anonymous 
witnesses, in October the White House defenders were fired at 
from the buildings of the Embassy. In addition, he called on 
those assembled to remind people of the Russian All-People's 
Union through gatherings outside the buildings of the Federation 
Council and State Duma while they are in session. 
  The notorious Sazhi Umalatova and Viktor Alksnis also spoke, 
attempting to draw a parallel between Bloody Sunday, 9 January 
1905, and today. Given that the small number of militiamen did 
not even try to influence those at the rally in any way, this 
kind of association did not really seem relevant. Donations 
were collected during the rally to help those wounded during the 
events at the White House and to help those imprisoned in 
Lefortovo.

  [Text] Today in Moscow, representatives of centrist parties 
discussed the possibility of holding presidential elections in 
Russia this year. 
  Taking part in today's open sitting of the Centrist bloc, 
apart from the hosts, were representatives of 14 parties and 
associations whose political inclinations and ideologies were in 
complete contrast, even at first glance. For instance, the 
Sakharov Union of Democratic Forces -- the initiator and creator 
of the Centrist bloc; the Muzyka publishing house; and arriving 
slightly late, but accompanied by a whole detachment, leader of 
the Pamyat National Patriotic Front Dmitriy Vasilyev. Very 
impressive, don't you think? 
  It was Mr. Vasilyev who began the discussion on the only 
issue on today's agenda: The possibility of holding early 
presidential elections on 12 June this year. 
  Well, the sitting started very sluggishly, and after 
numerous 
appeals by Chairman Vladimir Voronin [head of Sakharov Union of 
Democratic Forces] to begin discussing this vital political 
question, which received no response, the distraught chairman 
had to repeat his opening speech once again to rouse the sleepy 
participants. 
  Today's meeting is expected to result in the signing of a 
joint document on the need for early presidential elections. 
Many participants already believe that such a decision will be 
adopted.

  [Text] Moscow January 8 TASS -- Ad hoc committees and 
parliamentary groups set up to handle the preparation of the 
first session of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's new 
parliament, continued their work on Saturday. 
  Most heated debates took place at a meeting of the 
inter-regional association of independent deputies which was 
also attended by deputies who represent some Russian constituent 
republics and autonomous entities. The speakers stressed that 
independent deputies elected in individual constituencies who 
are not bound by any pledges to political parties, blocs and 
movements and who realise their responsibility before their 
voters, the constitution and Russia believe that "integration 
and coordination of efforts are necessary for real work of the 
State Duma." 
  The participants in the meeting discussed ways to reach the 
goals set by their joint declaration adopted on January 5. In 
the declaration they expressed their determination to build 
their activities in the State Duma on the basis of 
"parliamentary freedom and responsibility, common sense, 
political realism, pragmatism, and respect for opinions and 
positions of other factions and groups." They plan to nominate 
their own candidate to the post of the chairman of the State 
Duma as their first step in this direction. 
  The deputies called on their colleagues elected in 
individual 
constituencies to join their efforts for the benefit of all 
peoples of Russia. 
  The commission for the procedural regulations of the State 
Duma and the deputy status discussed key questions the solution 
of which should ensure the effective work of the parliament.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 8 Jan -- The opening of the Russian 
parliament, the Federal Assembly, which is scheduled to take 
place in three days, may be called the final result of the 
election marathon of last November and December. 
  The first sessions of the chambers will be held on 11 
January. They will sit separately because the Constitution does 
not provide for a ceremony of a joint opening session of the two 
parliamentary chambers. The chambers may sit together to hear 
messages from the president and the Constitutional Court and 
speeches of the leaders of foreign states, as well as on the 
occasions when the president of the country takes the oath of 
allegiance. [passage omitted] 
  In accordance with the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation, the Russian president is to open the first session 
of the upper chamber of the parliament. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from well-informed 
sources in the Kremlin that there are no plans for a "big 
opening speech" by the president in connection with the 
beginning of the parliament's work. It will most probably be 
just a message to the elected deputies, wishing them success. 
  According to the same source, Boris Yeltsin is planning a 
long program speech at a joint session of the two parliamentary 
chambers a little later, shortly after the Federal Assembly 
begins its work. It has been revealed that economic, political 
and social aspects of reform in Russia will be touched upon in 
that speech. At the moment it is still unknown in what form the 
president is going to convey it to the deputies; that is, 
whether it will be a message or whether he will deliver the 
speech in person.

  [Text] Moscow January 9 TASS -- Russia's communists 
gathered in the Moscow parliamentary centre on Saturday [8 
January] to discuss organisational and practical issues 
connected with the opening of the new parliament, the Federal 
Assembly. 
  The participants in the meeting focused on the political 
situation in the country and tasks of the communist faction in 
the State Duma, the lower house of the new parliament, the 
constitutional crisis in Russia, issues concerning the formation 
of the apparatus of the Federal Assembly and ways to resolve the 
economic and political crisis on the country, the Federal 
Assembly press service said. 
  The meeting was attended by party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
Valentin Kuptsov, Anatoliy Lukyanov, Vladimir Isakov, Sergey 
Glazyev, as well as representatives of other parliamentary 
factions and some independent deputies. 
  The Federal Assembly will convene for its first session on 
Tuesday, January 11. Both houses, the State Duma and the 
Federation Council, will seat separately since the new 
Constitution does not provide for joint sessions. However, the 
lower and the upper houses may get together in several cases, 
including to hear out presidential addresses and messages of the 
Constitution Court, speeches by leaders of foreign states and 
witness the inauguration of a new president. 
  The Federation Council, the upper house, which is comprised 
of two representatives from each subject of the Federation, is 
expected to convene at 10:00 in the former house of the press at 
Pushkinskaya Street, 26. 
  Simultaneously, the State Duma will gather at Novyy Arbat 
street, 36, in the former Comecon headquarters. For the first 
time in the history of Russia, the 450-seat lower house will be 
represented not only by independent deputies, but also election 
blocs and parties which have cleared the five per cent threshold 
as required by the law on elections to the State Duma. The 
political spectrum is very diverse and represents practically 
all forces from democrats- reformists from the Russia's Choice 
election bloc, on the one hand, to the Communist, the Agrarian 
and the Liberal Democratic parties, on the other hand. 
  In accordance with the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation, the first session of the upper house will be opened 
by the president. Well-informed sources in the Kremlin that 
there will be no "big opening address." Most likely, the 
president will give a brief speech laying the guidelines for the 
Council's future work. 
  The source said that Yeltsin is preparing a big speech which 
he will deliver at a joint session of the two houses some time 
after the Federation Council begins working. The speech will 
touch upon the economic, political and social aspects of reform 
in Russia. So far it is unclear whether the president will 
address the parliament personally or send a message.

  [Text] The organizing committee of State Duma sessions 
discussed the agenda for the first session of the new Russian 
parliament. Officials in the president's press service told 
Interfax that it will start with a speech by the oldest deputy, 
Georgiy Lukava, of the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  After that, deputies will hear a report of the Central 
Election Commission on the elections to the State Duma, elect a 
commission to supervise the operation of the electronic voting 
system, as well as elect a counting commission and a provisional 
secretariat of the State Duma, and discuss the procedural rules 
on parliamentary groups. 
  Following that, the organizing committee wants to have a 
break for the formation of a parliamentary group. The Duma must 
approve the minimal size of the group to be registered. Figures 
such as 14, 20, and 50 deputies have been suggested.

  [Text] The first session of the Federation Council, the 
upper house of the new Russian parliament, will open at 10:00 on 
Tuesday [11 January]. It will be held in the former Russian 
Press House, Ul. Pushkinskaya 26, and is to be addressed by 
President Boris Yeltsin, a source in the office of First Deputy 
Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeyko told Interfax. 
  A meeting chaired by Shumeyko on Monday prepared the agenda 
for the Federation Council's first day, which includes the 
election of the speaker, his deputies, chairpersons for 10 
proposed committees and the senior bodies of the house, as well 
as voting on session regulations. 
  Shumeyko is going to run for speaker, the source in his 
office said. 
  Federation Council deputies, who asked not to be identified, 
told Interfax that, in addition to Shumeiko and former chairman 
of the Moscow City Council Nikolay Gonchar, candidates to the 
post of speaker might include the chairmen of the parliaments of 
the Russian republics of Karelia and Komi, Viktor Stepanov and 
Yuriy Spiridonov. The deputies described the latter two as 
"independent politicians standing for a single Russian 
Federation." 
  The deputies said a motion was expected to be made to elect 
three deputy speakers, one representing the republics, one the 
regions, and one the autonomous areas of Russia.

  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- A list of materials to be 
submitted for the consideration of people's deputies at the 
first meeting of the State Duma was drawn up on Sunday [9 
January] at a final session of the organising committee for 
preparing first meetings of the State Duma of the Federal 
Assembly of the Russian Federation, ITAR-TASS learned today at 
the current information centre under the administration of the 
Russian president. 
  The suggested materials include the Russian Constitution, a 
list of the laws of the Russian Federation adopted between May 
31, 1990, and September 20, 1993, presidential decrees to be 
submitted for the consideration of the Federal Assembly, 
collections of decrees of the Russian president, resolutions of 
the Council of Ministers -- Government of the Russian 
Federation, as well as draft documents drawn up by the 
organising committee for preparing first meetings of the State 
Duma, which are needed for the beginning of the State Duma's 
work. 
  A draft procedure for holding the first meeting of the State 
Duma was approved and submitted to people's deputies. It 
envisages the opening of the meeting of the State Duma by the 
oldest people's deputy, a report of the Central Electoral 
Commission of the Russian Federation on the results of elections 
to the State Duma, the election of the commission for control 
over the electronic system, the election of the counting 
commission, the election of the provisional secretariat of the 
State Duma, the adoption of provisions of the regulations of the 
State Duma on parliamentary factions and groups. 
  On the suggestion of members of the organising committee, it 
is planned to make a break for forming parliamentary factions 
and groups. After the break the State Duma will hear a report 
of the provisional secretariat of the State Duma on the 
parliamentary groups created there, as well as suggestions of 
the groups about a further working schedule of the Duma. 
  Members of the organising committee got back to discussing 
individual articles of the draft regulations of the State Duma 
to be submitted for the consideration of the first meeting. 
Thus, the proposal was accepted on granting equal rights to 
factions and groups. During the exchange of views a discussion 
began about the minimal strength of the parliamentary group, 
needed for its official registration. On the suggestion of 
individual factions, it is planned to submit for the 
consideration of the Duma the following figures: the minimal 
strength of the group should be 14, 20 or 50 people's deputies. 
  The organising committee discussed as well materials of the 
commission for organising the work of parliamentary factions, 
the commission for forming State Duma committees and the 
commission for locating working agencies of the State Duma. It 
was decided to submit those materials for the consideration of 
people's deputies. 
  According to the current information centre, the meeting of 
the organising committee was held in a businesslike and 
constructive atmosphere.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
0311 GMT on 10 January broadcasts a correspondent's report on 
interviews with members of the new State Duma about what the 
first day of the parliament's work will bring. 
  Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord [PRUA] says: "I believe that the first session will be 
fairly quiet." He goes on to say: "Various commissions will be 
set up. One must remember, however, that the new Constitution 
does not give the control function to parliament. Therefore, 
commissions will be involved in preparing parliamentary hearings 
on various issues. This is the parliament's right, and I am sure 
that there will be many commissions on parliamentary hearings. 
I believe that the emergence of coalitions in the Duma will 
depend on the nature of questions at issue. There will be no 
organized coalitions in the Duma, with a unanimous vote. Is 
that good or bad? 
  "Speaking about all of this, I would always urge one to 
compare the present body of deputies, albeit very imperfect, 
with the body of deputies of the Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet of the previous convocation. According to Vitaliy 
Vorotnikov, formerly chairman of the Russian Federation Council 
of Ministers, democrats had 22 percent of seats in that 
parliament. Now they have more seats, though less than 50 
percent. Therefore, we are moving forward despite everything." 
  Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist faction, is then 
asked for his view of the work of the new State Duma. He says: 
"The coordination is proceeding with difficulty. Burbulis 
stated recently -- it is no secret -- that they are not too keen 
on developing contacts with others, including us, but I believe 
that they are doomed to seek agreement, unless they plan to give 
new orders to disband the Duma by force. Not only has their 
position no future, I believe, but in the context of the recent 
changes in public opinion and in attitudes to their course, it 
is also dangerous for everyone. One should understand very well 
that we all have very little time for all this coordination 
because there are already mass stoppages of production. At many 
factories, people will only work 10-12 days at most in January, 
and will receive a small allowance. By spring, they will have 
eaten up their supplies, they will have worn out the shoes 
bought back in the times of developed socialism, and they may 
then behave in a way totally different from what some of our 
radicals think." 
  In conclusion, an independent deputy is then asked for his 
views. He says that the independents will push the interests of 
their districts. There are many young people in the Duma who 
are keen on working but not on squabbles. Viktor Sheynis of the 
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc says that the Duma will have two 
main levers affecting the state policy: legislation and the 
budget.

  [Text] Addressing the group of independent deputies in the 
new parliament, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said 
that the government will never align itself with the extreme 
right or with the extreme left, but will always stick to its 
reform policies. He said that the country will no longer be 
subjected to shock treatment. Inconsistent and impetuous 
behavior is intolerable, especially where it concerns the 
economy, he said. At the same time Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed 
that the government does not intend to use populist methods 
either.

  [Text] Representatives of the State Duma's influential 
factions intend to demand a detailed report on government 
spending on repairing the White House. 
  Deputies of a major parliamentary faction told Interfax that 
the rubles and hard-currency reserved for buying building 
materials, equipment and furniture had been mishandled. 
  According to some estimates, spending on the restoration and 
construction work alone amounts to $75 Mn-$85 Mn. The work is 
done round the clock by Russia builders and their Turkish 
colleagues from the companies Enka and Gama.

<F P=106> [Ruslan Ignatyev report: "Parliamentary Center Will Be </F>
Built"] 
  [Text] Russian Federation Government Chairman Viktor 
Chernomyrdin signed on 6 January 1994 decree No. 1 "On 
Constructing a Complex of Buildings for a Parliamentary Center 
-- Official Residence of the Federal Assembly." ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA's correspondent asked Russian Federation Minister V. 
Kvasov, leader of the Russian Government apparatus, to comment 
on this document. 
  "This decision was adopted with a view to creating 
conditions 
for efficient work by the Federal Assembly's Federation Council 
and State Duma. Work on constructing the complex of buildings 
for the new Parliamentary Center will be carried out in 
1994-1995. The Moscow Government, jointly with the Russian 
President's Administration of Affairs, have been instructed to 
identify within one month a site in central Moscow where the 
complex will be built. A government commission has been set up 
for the prompt examination of issues and for coordinating the 
activity of organizations engaged in building the Parliamentary 
Center. 
  "A competition has been announced to decide the best 
project, 
open to Russian and foreign firms. The conditions and procedure 
for conducting it are being elaborated at present. Russia's 
Ministry of the Economy has been instructed to provide for the 
appropriation of the necessary limits of state capital 
investments, including foreign currency funds, for planning and 
building the complex in 1994-1995. 
  "It is planned that the complex will be connected to the 
presidential, government, and special systems of telephone 
communications and data communications network; it will be 
fitted with modern technical safety systems, and it is planned 
to use a system for television surveillance, radiation 
monitoring, and fire safety. 
  "The new Parliamentary Center is scheduled for commissioning 
during the first six months of 1995."

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Orlov article: "Portrait of Duma in Figures"] </F>
  [Text] The Central Electoral Commission's lists are short 
and dry, but they allow us to make several observations on the 
composition of parliament's lower chamber. The deputy is first 
and foremost a person with higher education (94.4 percent), male 
(87.2 percent), and he is often a Muscovite (62.2 percent of the 
federationwide list). The Duma's oldest member is Georgiy 
Lukava (born 1925), head of department at the Moscow State 
Technical University for Civil Aviation, and the youngest is 
Aleksey Zuyev (born 1970), an adviser to the president of the 
"GMM" company (both are members of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia [LDPR]). The average age of deputies in the Duma is a 
little over 40. It is noteworthy that although almost equal 
percentages of deputies have higher education [as published], 
the figure is lower in the LDPR where it is 89.9 percent 
(according to the federationwide list). 
  Some 54 of the 444 deputies elected are functionaries of 
electoral associations and political organizations which did not 
participate in the elections for the federationwide district. 
Party leaders account for 5 percent of the Duma's total 
membership (22 deputies), and local party functionaries, 
advisers, and leaders of party apparatuses account for 7.2 
percent (32 deputies). Contrary to expectations, representation 
of trade union activists proved to be low -- three deputies or 
0.7 percent. 
  Some 80 of the people's elected representatives are 
representatives of the executive or representative branches of 
power, including 25 members of the Russian Federation Government 
and leaders and workers of the central ministries and 
departments (5.6 percent) and 49 administration heads, 
representatives of the president, and other leaders of the 
executive branch of power in the provinces (11 percent). 
  Workers in the intellectual sphere (the "educated class") 
are 
very well represented with 116 deputies, or 26.1 percent. 
Frankly, there are few doctors and school teachers and there 
are not many more higher education teachers among the deputies; 
however, the numbers of leaders and staff of the new kind of 
analytical organizations (specialists and the like) is 
significant. The new parliament will be scarcely more 
professional than the previous one: It contains only 29 lawyers 
(6.5 percent), and a significant number of them are concentrated 
in potentially government-oriented factions. There are 11 
journalists in the State Duma (2.3 percent). The number of 
entrepreneurs and managers of commercial and state enterprises 
-- 47 (10.6 percent) -- is significant.

affecting public interests; 
  to issue warnings to mass media in accordance with Article 
16 
of the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media" in the absence 
of the Russian Federation Ministry of Press and Information. 
  4. To appoint Anatoliy Borisovich Vengerov chairman of the 
Court of Appeal for Information Disputes Under the President of 
the Russian Federation. 
  5. To appoint members of the Court of Appeal for Information 
Disputes Under the President of the Russian Federation (see

activity, to form as its working apparatus a Secretariat of the 
Court of Appeal for Information Disputes Under the President of 
the Russian Federation with the status of department within the 
Russian Federation President's Administration. 
  The leader of the Russian Federation President's 
Administration is to approve the structure and numerical 
strength of the working apparatus.

associations, and officials and over the decisions being made by 
them associated with the observance, protection, and defense of 
citizens' rights and legal interests. 
  4. It is prescribed that state television and radio 
broadcasting companies' information programs are to inform 
citizens without fail of the main provisions of legal acts and 
the decisions of state organs for main questions of domestic and 
foreign policy on the day they are broadcast. 
  5. State television and radio broadcasting companies are to 
produce cycles of broadcasts (programs) explaining the activity 
of federal organs of the legislative, executive, and judicial 
branches and the essence of the decisions being made, with 
leading specialists, experts, and drafters of the relevant 
documents being brought in to work on these programs. 
  It is prescribed that the length and frequency of the 
broadcasting of the said programs is determined autonomously by 
the leaders of state television and radio broadcasting companies. 
  6. State television and radio broadcasting companies' 
programs are to give equal coverage to the activity of federal 
organs of legislative, executive, and judicial power. 
  The Court of Appeal for Information Disputes Under the 
President of the Russian Federation is to monitor the 
objectivity of the coverage of such activity. 
  7. Guided by Article 15 Paragraph 4 of the Russian 
Federation Constitution, when the mass media are covering the

Assembly on relations between states' parliaments and mass media 
(Collected Acts of the Russian Federation President and 
Government, 1993, No. 15, Article 1340), and this includes 
bearing in mind the limited nature of television channels:

parliamentary activity is to be published. 
  The provisions of Resolution No. 820 (1984) apply to 
relations between other federal organs of state power and the 
mass media, and this includes establishing the following 
principles for making live television and radio transmissions or 
recorded broadcasts which are the same for all federal organs: 
  the need for a television or radio broadcasting company to 
obtain consent to make a transmission from a session of the 
relevant federal organ of state power; 
  the timely notification of television and radio broadcasting 
companies about the proposed consideration of the most important 
questions of public interest; 
  a television or radio broadcasting company's choice of time 
(length) of broadcast and its form (live or recorded). 
  8. The Russian Federal Service for Television and Radio 
Broadcasting is to tighten control over television and radio 
broadcasting organizations' strict observance of the Russian 
Federation Law "On the Mass Media." 
  9. This edict comes into force the moment it is signed.

  [Text] Moscow January 9 TASS -- Directors of nine leading R 
&amp; D institutions of Russia have addressed President Yeltsin 
with 
a letter backing the policy of the Russian Ministry of Science, 
which gives priority to a competitory way of financing national 
research and development, in lieu of the centralized and 
"departmental" way of financing, suggested by Russia's Academy 
of Sciences. 
  Among the address' authors were directors of Kurchatov's 
Institute of Nuclear Physics, Institute of Physics of Russia's 
Academy of Sciences, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Russian 
Research Centre of Applied Chemistry and the All-Russian 
Research Institute of Electric Machinery. 
  The letter was written in response to a resolution adopted 
in 
December 1993 by the presidium of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences. The resolution said that the modern crisis of "the 
eldest scientific organization of the country" was largely 
caused by the lack of budgetary funds "passing through the 
Ministry of Science." 
  The presidium of the academy urged to reshuffle the Ministry 
of Science to the corresponding state committee which would 
focus solely on federal R &amp; D programs, and not on 
independent R 
&amp; D projects. In other case, the academy leaders warned they 
would submit a resolution of no confidence to Science Minister 
Boris Saltykov. 
  However, scientists who addressed Yeltsin wrote that such a 
policy would even further aggravate the collapse of science in 
Russia protesting against "the departmental principle of money 
distribution" as it "will result in equal empoverishment (of all 
institutions)." On the contrary, it would be better to keep 
pursuing the ministerial policy aimed at financing priority 
studies, they concluded.

  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- The state security service 
detected and thwarted last year attempts to recruit several 
high-ranking officials, about which President Boris Yeltsin was 
personally notified, Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of 
the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, said at a briefing in 
the Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday [10 January]. 
  "We are working on all these cases in close contact with 
head 
of the president's office Sergey Filatov," Stepashin added. 
Some people who established contacts with foreign intelligence 
officers, have been released from their posts. 
  According to Stepashin, 20 people were arrested on espionage 
charges in 1993. Several dozen more espionage cases are still 
under investigation. 
  Stepashin specially stressed that, apart from countries 
outside the former Soviet Union, the Baltics and countries of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States with which Russia has an 
understanding on refraining from intelligence operations against 
one another, are actively engaged in intelligence work against 
Russia. 
  The deputy director confirmed that Russian security officers 
arrested last summer five Georgian spies fulfilling intelligence 
tasks. An Estonian intelligence agent was detained in the Pskov 
region. Apart from all else, he committed a grave criminal 
offence -- a murder.

<F P=106> [Mariya Varenga article: "First Anniversary of Channel Six"] </F>
  [Text] New Year's Day 1994 marked the first anniversary of 
the first independent Russian channel, TV 6 Moscow, going out on 
air. 
  So the fledgling enterprise is alive. When it was still only 
at the planning stage, people were bewildered by the author and 
parent of this scheme, Eduard Sagalayev: This popular 
television journalist had held too high posts in the past for 
him so easily to launch himself into a fairly risky venture. 
Nevertheless, in this country it is not the "nocturnal Zephyr" 
which floods the airwaves but the Ostankino state television 
tower's central control room. This is why the freedom to express 
oneself on television is as yet subject to many conditions here. 
What is there to say about one private television channel taken 
in isolation, which is beating the state television network's 
cunning ruses. 
  At first the founder of the Moscow Independent Broadcasting 
Corporation's channel six really did have literally nothing 
except a license to broadcast -- good intentions to begin the 
unitary television system's destatization. He had neither 
premises nor funds, but nevertheless persistent rumors about 
each TV 6 staffer having his own Mercedes were doing the rounds 
even among experienced television personnel. All the more so 
as, after all, billionaire Ted Turner, who is famous for his 
whims and a certain weakness for Russia, became TV 6's patron. 
  The emergence of the channel was, oh, so complicated. For a 
whole year representatives of the Moscow Independent 
Broadcasting Corporation and Turner Broadcasting 
Systems,zmopping their fevered brows, busted a gut to put 
together a contract for the joint enterprise: Lawyers in Russia 
had never before had to work on such a project. They came to an 
agreement after long discussions: Russian news stories would 
come together in a sizzling combination with American films on 
TV 6. 
  The idea behind Sagalayev's enterprise could not have made 
better sense: a channel standing outside politics and ideology 
and enjoying all the advantages of an outsider. "A very 
opportune idea," a well-known politician, who today would hardly 
be able to hold his audience's attention, would say about this: 
The elections proved that the "electorate" no longer excuses 
poor delivery. 
  As far as TV 6 is concerned, politics exists only in its 
strictly private manifestation -- in the family setting. Here 
it is, however, no less controversial and hazardous than 
intrigues at the highest level. Whereas the other five channels 
are running discussions on the grave crisis, TV 6 is unabashedly 
putting out a Fred Astaire tap dancing routine, the breathy 
tones of Tatyana Doronina, the guilty smile of Leonov, and so on 
and so forth. Unfortunately, the majority of our cinemas' 
posters simply cannot compete with TV 6: "Hollywood's Golden 
Film Library," "Cinema TV 6," "Children's Screening," and 
starting in the new year "Masterpieces of World Cinema" -- where 
else will you see such a wide range of films? 
  But channel six had to remember about unity of place and 
time: The neutral black studio backdrop was no help. The talk 
show "Eduard Sagalayev Presents..." first of all introduced the 
viewers to an "apolitical" Federov, then afterwards announced a 
forthcoming meeting with Sergey Shakhray. It is good that this 
rendezvous did not take place: Politicians are not protected by 
the wives they appear alongside on TV 6. The very sad 
conclusion has inevitably to be drawn: It is impossible to live 
in our society and be free from.... It is all right to talk 
about anything else, and he has some highly attractive future 
proposals. 
  In January the first editions of the television magazine 
program for men and women will go out: To the CNN international 
news will be added thematic news broadcasts from this 
corporation which are unknown to the Russian viewing public: 
"Show Business News," "Traveler's Guide," "A Look into the 
Future," and "Style." An unusual gameshow "Your Decision" is in 
store for the viewers, which is a series of films, in which the 
viewers themselves determine the outcome of the action. The 
first sports broadcasts will appear on TV 6 in 1994: TV 6 will 
be screening footage of the U.S. open figure skating 
championships in January.

<TEXT>
Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
0939 GMT on 7 January carries an interview with Sergey 
Aleksandrovich Zverev, deputy director general of the MOST 
group, one of founders of the new Independent Television 
service, Nezavisimoye Televideniye, NTV, by correspondent Boris 
Simonov. 
  Introducing the interview, the announcer notes that a 
Russian 
government decision to set up NTV on the 4th channel has been in 
effect since the beginning of the year. 
  Zverev says: "NTV will start to go out on the 4th TV channel 
round about mid-January, from 1800," adding that on weekdays 
services will run until about midnight, and maybe later on 
Friday and Saturday. 
  On programming, Zverev says: "To start with, there will be a 
cartoon for the children--various cartoons, both home-produced 
and foreign. At 1830, a documentary TV serial will be shown. 
That will begin with the TV series `The Most Notorious Crimes,' 
which are documentary films about the most notorious courtroom 
trials of the 20th Century. After that, at 1900 and at 2200, 
there will be the daily editions of the `Today' news program, 
after which there will be a feature film." Zverev goes on to 
mention some of the feature films to be shown - all detective 
stories. 
  Asked why he is going into television, Zverev replies: "From 
a certain point onward, it's quite a profitable investment of 
money, a profitable business. Admittedly, that time doesn't 
come until about 10 years after work has started. But it's also 
quite a profitable investment of money from the point of view of 
our slight contribution to the stabilization of our society." He 
adds: "After all, we're all tired of the joyless TV screen that 
awaits us every evening at home. There is no happy program that 
one could watch every evening. And when people came along, 
saying that they knew how to do it, they had the ability to do 
it, the banks that are taking part in the financing simply took 
their word for it and dealt only with the finance. All the 
ideology and the content aspect of the channel is a matter for 
the professionals who are dealing with it today." 
  Asked to expand on the financing, Zverev said: "We have an 
agreement on the financing of NTV. There is the National Credit 
Bank and the MOST group in the capital. All these financial 
groups are the founders of NTV. I would like to stress once 
again that we conduct all discussions, all decisions and the 
financing of all projects on a completely equal basis."

<F P=106> [Nikita Vaynonen commentary: "Will Things Be Any Easier for </F>
the Reader? The President Is Concerned About the Right to 
Information, the Premier About the Newspapers' Survival"] 
  [Text] The start of the year has been marked by two events 
for the mass media. The strike by leading Russian newspapers 
seems to have been averted. Journalists had been about to 
venture upon this as a forced measure to protest against the 
increased cost of printing brought about by the revaluation of 
industry's fixed capital. Presidential edicts have been issued 
"On Additional Guarantees of the Right of Citizens to 
Information" and "On the Judicial Chamber for Information 
Disputes Under the Russian Federation President.". 
  It is impossible not to perceive a certain logic in the fact 
that these events coincided. Albeit a paradoxical logic. It is 
difficult to make any objection to the revaluation of fixed 
capital. It has been brought about by the objective need to 
bring its value into line with the ruble's desiccated weight 
category. There has long been talk of this, so the government's 
decision just cannot be called unexpected. There was more than 
enough time to reflect on all its consequences. It was not hard 
to foresee that the revaluation of fixed capital would prove 
ruinous to those production processes whose output is paid for 
by the consumer a long time in advance -- subscriptions to 
newspapers and journals represent just such a form of payment. 
Consequently, if we do not wish to be deprived of the press, we 
must be forearmed: We must provide for tax breaks for 
periodicals and subsidies for subscribers, allocating for the 
purpose some portion (not even a very considerable portion!) of 
the increase that the treasury will receive as a result of the 
growth in the capital's value and, thus, the tax on that value. 
Nothing of the kind was done, and things turned out once again 
as in the proverb: The peasant only bothers to make the sign of 
the cross when he hears thunder. It seemed that a compromise 
solution had been found at last Thursday's meeting between the 
chief editors of leading newspapers and Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. A promise was made to think about how to ease the 
tax burden for the press, about the participation of journalists 
in the flotation of shares in printing plants, and about other 
demands made. In the television report on the meeting certain 
editors were even heard to say that this was almost the start of 
a new epoch in relations between the press and the power. But 
such optimism seems somewhat premature. 
  It probably goes without saying that in planning to strike, 
journalists were thinking above all not of themselves but of the 
readers -- of the very right of citizens to information which is 
the subject of the presidential edict. If the powers that be 
strengthen juridical guarantees of that right with one hand 
while undermining economic guarantees with the other, this 
clearly attests to a lack of coordination in their actions. The 
path of free speech is of itself thorny and steep, but must each 
step along it really demand that press people have to resort to 
extreme measures and superhuman effort? The ink had not had 
time to dry on the president's signature on the Edict on 
Information Guarantees before journalists started saying that 
the edict was unlikely to work. Quite frankly, there are 
serious grounds for this skepticism. 
  The legal norms proclaimed in the edict conform to the most 
modern world standards. State organs, organizations, 
enterprises, public associations, and officials must conduct 
their activity on the principles of information openness. As 
the edict explains, this means that any information which is of 
public interest or which affects citizens' personal interests 
must be accessible to them. The state is obliged systematically 
to inform you and me about decisions proposed or adopted, and we 
have the right to monitor these decisions if, as the edict 
states, they entail "compliance with or protection and defense 
of citizens' rights and legitimate interests." 
  In order for even the very best legal norm to be 
implemented, a mechanism is needed for its execution, but the 
edict does not contain this. Let us hope that it will appear in 
the law on the right to information, which the same edict 
entrusts the Legislative Proposals Commission with drawing up. 
While this law is being created, there is a perfectly real 
danger that the edict could be utilized by no means 
beneficially. Who will decide which information "is of public 
interest" and consequently must be generally accessible? Who is 
authorized to indicate which decisions entail "compliance with 
citizens' rights and legitimate interests" and which do not? 
Without a clear-cut legal answer to these questions, such 
powers will undoubtedly be appropriated by a state official, 
i.e. by the person who possesses the information. Having 
appropriated them, he will use them in his own interests. You 
and I will never learn what he categorizes as being of no public 
significance.... 
  It seems to me that the existing Law on the Mass Media 
contains a far more sensible legal norm (Article 40): "It is 
possible to withhold requested information only if it contains 
information which constitutes a state, commercial, or other 
secret specially protected by law." The Law on the Mass Media 
also provides for a mechanism for exercising the right to 
information and penalties for an unsubstantiated refusal to 
provide it (Articles 38-41, 47, 58, 61). I believe that 
references to these legal norms in the presidential edict would 
have sufficed to remove all questions. It is hard to understand 
why the drafters of such an important document did not do this. 
  On the other hand, the Edict on Information Guarantees 
rectifies the mistake made at the time of the election campaign 
or, to be exact, long before it: Owing to the paucity of 
information, chiefly television information, society had a very 
poor and largely a distorted idea of the government's policy, 
and in the runup to the election this idea was still further 
distorted by the false populist propaganda of overt and covert 
antireformers. The edict obliges the state television and radio 
companies to notify citizens of all legal acts and decisions of 
state organs on the day they are issued and to create programs 
which explain the activities of the legislature, the executive, 
and the judiciary. 
  To monitor the objectivity of the coverage of these 
activities, the other presidential edict sets up the Judicial 
Chamber for Information Disputes. I would like to be able to 
welcome it, like the first edict, unreservedly. The chamber is 
to help the president of Russia in protecting rights and 
freedoms in the sphere of mass information, ensure the objective 
and reliable nature of reports and the principle of equality in 
this sphere, protect the moral interests of children and young 
people, observe pluralism of opinions, and even correct factual 
mistakes in information reports, but here too there are 
questions. The Judicial Chamber is entrusted, inter alia, with 
resolving disputes among parliamentary factions over the 
distribution of airtime and issuing warnings to editorial boards 
which abuse freedom of speech. This requires direct powers. 
Although the edict states that the Judicial Chamber "is not 
part of the system of Russian Federation federal courts," if you 
proceed from the essence of the assignments given it, it will 
possess not only judicial but also administrative power, and 
also, partly, legislative power, it seems, since it just cannot 
manage without drawing up corresponding legal regulations in 
order to carry out its functions (for example, to distribute 
airtime, ensure equal rights, and resolve disputes). Will it not 
turn into something like the notorious oversight council, of 
which the former Supreme Soviet used to dream so, only this time 
under the Russian Federation president? The boards of guardians 
which exist in many countries, representing the interests of 
society in television, operate by force of authority, not 
imperious command, but the chamber is not free of the risk of 
turning into an administrative organ with a censorial bent. 
Firm guarantees are needed against such a metamorphosis.

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Excerpts] You are listening to Slavyanka, the radio 
station of Russia's Ministry of Defense, and now -- and what 
could be more natural -- here is Russia's Defense Minister, Army 
General Pavel Grachev. The recording was made at the very end 
of the outgoing year when he was rounding up its results, and 
these results, I must say, were extensive and varied, and out of 
all that variety, we have selected the things that concern 
everyone directly: housing, conditions of service -- but each of 
you can add to the list yourself. Listen on. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Grachev recording] [passage omitted] Regarding 
military discipline: the results of 1993 show that, 
unfortunately, due to serious failings in the work of staff 
commanders and educational organs at all levels, and also 
through lack of personal discipline, people continue to die, 
weapons, ammunition, and military property are misappropriated, 
and cases of absence without leave continue to occur. 
  The Ministry of Defense is making every effort to solve 
these 
problems. To illustrate this, we managed this year to slightly 
reduce the gravity of problems linked to losses and 
misappropriations of weapons and ammunition. In comparison with 
the identical period last year, the quantity of misappropriated 
weapons fell by a factor of more than 17. In comparison with 
1992, the number of dead was almost halved. 
  An order of the Ministry of Defense on measures for 
maintaining law and order and military discipline in the Russian 
Armed Forces has been worked out and dispatched to the troops 
with the aim of improving discipline in the forces. 
  We believe that its execution will enable the state of 
affairs in this area to be improved significantly in 1994. [end

Directorate announcement: "In Strict Accordance With the Law"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Defense Ministry has ceased 
funding the activity of Russia's military courts as of 1 January 
1994. 
  This decision fully conforms with the Russian Federation Law 
"On the Status of Courts in the Russian Federation," regulating 
both the status of courts under general jurisdiction and 
military courts. The law, in particular, envisages that the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Justice takes steps to create the 
conditions needed for judicial activity and its cadre, 
organizational, and resources support. 
  A 4 November 1993 decree of the Russian Federation Council 
of 
Ministers-Government ratified the statute on the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Justice. This document also confirms 
that military courts are part of the unified system of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Justice. One of the tasks 
assigned to the said ministry, according to the statute, is to 
fund the appropriate courts. 
  The said draft legislative acts were formulated directly by 
organs of justice and were not coordinated in any way with the 
Russian Defense Ministry.

<F P=106> [Article by Russian Federation Communist Party Central </F>
Committee First Secretary Gennadiy Zyuganov: "On the Military 
Doctrine. The Contours of Russia's Strength"] 
  [Text] The many centuries of Russian history teem with 
military upheavals -- attacks, aggression, and intervention. 
There have often been people around who wanted to test the 
strength of our statehood to "breaking point." The country's 
fate has often hung by a thread -- and only the Army's military 
might and the mass heroism of the people saved our dying 
country. In this respect the special, close attention and 
impassioned and burning interest which Russian society has 
always shown for issues of military policy and the country's 
defense doctrine are understandable. The recent collapse of the 
seemingly immovable foundations of life and philosophy, 
accompanied by the major shifts in the international 
military-strategic sphere, has exacerbated these problems still 
further. That is why the impatience with which the emergence of 
the new Russia's military doctrine -- promised by the president 
more than a year ago -- is entirely understandable. 
  The "Main Provisions of Russian Federation Military 
Doctrine" 
examined at the Security Council's 3 March and 6 October 1993 
sessions and introduced by Presidential Edict No. 1833 of 2 
November have finally appeared in the press. 
  Quite frankly, when you read certain parts of the document 
you may doubt that it is talking about the armed forces of an 
independent and sovereign state -- the service of some abstract 
"world community efforts" and "different collective security 
organs" is imposed so blatantly. The following provisions are 
quite simply discouraging: "in order to safeguard military 
security the state resolves the following tasks: ...providing 
backup for operations by the UN Security Council and other 
international organizations." Will our state henceforth really 
be just an organ to serve Security Council operations; will UN 
interests really take precedence over our own national interests? 
  On reading the document it is alarming to learn that the 
Armed Forces are given the role of guaranteeing so-called 
"democratic transformations" -- in other words, the Army is 
called upon to use its bayonets to maintain a regime pursuing an 
antinational, antistate policy and, consequently, to wage war 
against its own country's citizens. The Army does not have such 
functions in any state other than a dictatorship. 
  This cannot be acceptable for Russia -- not only because of 
its historical traditions, but also because of the people-based 
[narodnyy] nature of the Army. Despite all the political 
upheavals in the USSR and Russia, despite all the gibes and 
mockery, the Army has accomplished the impossible -- it has 
remained intact following the collapse of the Union, when it 
found itself in the situation of being an "army without a state." 
  This is all the more impressive given that this mortal blow 
was followed by a campaign to divide up the living Army between 
the newly "sovereign" republics, to extort new oaths, and to 
bribe and blackmail the officer corps. The Army's position 
among the people has remained firm, despite the fact that 
certain crack teams of elite forces riddled the country's top 
state organ with bullets before the very eyes of a stunned 
world. The scorn and hatred of their fellow soldiers are the 
everlasting companions of these splittists. The Russian Army 
saved itself thanks to the powerful patriotic instinct of our 
officers and men, and to the fact that the backbone of the 
command staff is made up of Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, 
and Tatars -- the peoples who laid the foundations of our great 
state. 
  This also applies in full to the millions-strong army of 
scientists, managers, engineers, and workers in the 
military-industrial complex who never cease to astonish the 
world by producing the most modern equipment and armaments in a 
country where everything has seemingly collapsed for good. 
  Conceptually a military doctrine, by definition, represents 
the socially accepted totality of the state's views on the goals 
and nature of a possible war, of the preparations for it by the 
country and the Armed Forces, and of ways of waging that war. 
It should define the enemy or enemies with which military 
confrontation is possible, what might be the aims and nature of 
such a war or wars, what armed forces the state requires to 
conduct hostilities successfully, and what are the main areas 
for their organizational development and the procedure for 
preparing the country for different military conflicts. 
  In general terms a state's military doctrine is based on 
interrelated military-political, military-strategic, and 
military-technical foundations. A detailed elaboration of 
military doctrine as a guide to action for the various state 
structures, ministries, and departments responsible for the 
country's protection "by force" presupposes an extensive 
description of the practical organizational, legal, financial, 
and other mechanisms which guarantee the effective 
transformation of the state's military potential into specific 
factors of its Armed Forces' combat might. At the same time, 
its fundamental political section -- compact and clear-cut -- 
can be briefly set out in the form of a number of theses. 
  I do not plan to assess the published document from a purely 
military or military-technical standpoint. To certain 
specialists it seems quite constructive and in line with the 
realities of our difficult transitional period. But when it 
comes to its political tenets it looks -- sadly! -- more than 
dubious in respect of a whole series of positions that are of 
fundamental importance for Russian security. 
  The tumultuous events of recent years have fundamentally 
altered the geopolitical situation in every aspect -- from the 
ideological to the economic and the religious. These changes 
could not fail to affect the military-political sphere, the 
situation in which can now be described in terms of the 
following highly important factors: 
  1. The collapse of the USSR. The disappearance from the 
geopolitical arena of such a powerful military-political entity 
has led to a major deformation of the "force field" of all world 
politics. The global balance of power established in the world 
as a result of World War II and for which mankind paid with tens 
of millions of lives has been irreversibly destroyed. The 
bipolar world system based on the strategic priority of two 
equally great "power centers" -- the USSR and the United States 
-- has become a thing of the past. 
  2. The abolition of the Warsaw Pact. This military bloc -- 
the counterweight to NATO in Europe -- served to maintain the 
military balance of power on which world stability has been 
based for the past 40 years. Its collapse is the second factor, 
following the collapse of the USSR, that marks a fundamental 
change in the military-strategic situation in the world. 
  3. The qualitative increase in U.S. geopolitical positions. 
As a result of the disappearance of the Soviet "power center," 
the United States has to all intents and purposes managed to 
carry out a fundamental revision of the results of World War II 
in its favor, to use its influence to fill the 
military-political "vacuums" that have emerged in the world, and 
to adopt in the international community the role of undoubted 
global leader in terms of all the most important power 
parameters. 
  In abstract terms our national interests in the immediate 
future would be best served by well-intentioned partnership 
relations with America in all spheres -- including the 
military sphere -- provided that the relationship is one of 
equal rights and mutual advantage. That is beyond dispute. 
What is at issue is the question of how realistic it is to try 
to ensure the long-term stability of these relations without 
sacrificing Russia's state priorities. Thus, while making the 
utmost effort to develop Russo-U.S. cooperation in the political 
and economic spheres, we simply do not have the right to 
forget that our military might, which ensures the proper respect 
and attention of our partner, will in this case be a very 
constructive factor in such bilateral relations. 
  It would also be irresponsible to forget that, since World 
War II, every U.S. military doctrine -- whether the strategy of 
"massive retaliation," "realistic deterrence," or "flexible 
response" -- has been subordinate to the idea of global 
hegemony. Even back in 1945 President Truman stressed in a 
message to Congress that the victory in the war had left the 
American people "confronting an urgent and permanent need to 
assume world leadership." 
  In January 1993 the U.S. defense secretary submitted to 
Congress a document entitled "U.S. Defense Strategy for the 
Nineties: The Regional Dimension." This document recognizes 
"maintaining a high level of armed forces' combat readiness" and 
a deterrence potential across the range of possible conflicts as 
being "extremely important to maintaining the U.S. leading role, 
with which it can shape the future." Given the overall trend 
for a shift in emphasis in armed forces' organizational 
development away from confrontation with the USSR (now Russia) 
toward "countering regional threats," the "Defense Strategy" 
recognizes that "deterring nuclear attack should remain the top 
priority." 
  Under these conditions it is necessary for the Russian 
military doctrine to envisage symmetrical combat capabilities 
for our Army. 
  4. The strengthening of the NATO bloc and its new quality. 
The evident desire of a number of Central and East European 
countries to join NATO, the lack of any realistic counterweight 
to its military might in Europe following the Soviet troop 
withdrawal from Germany and Poland, and the attempts to expand 
the bloc's sphere of responsibility and win a UN mandate for 
"peacekeeping operations" in "hot spots" in Europe and even the 
CIS all demonstrate that NATO aspires to the role of 
military-political referee in the vast geopolitical area 
stretching from Greenland to the Persian Gulf. 
  5. The emergence of a European geopolitical center. 
Following the end of the Cold War, the importance of the United 
States as guarantor of European security is to a considerable 
extent being lost, which makes it possible to predict the 
galvanization of an independent "Eurocentric" policy within the 
EC. 
  In its many centuries of confrontation with Russia, Europe 
-- 
particularly West Europe -- has always seen itself as an 
integrated whole. The trend toward integration among the 
European states, should it result in the creation of a viable 
and lasting union with a unified military-political structure, 
could in the future substantially influence the geopolitical 
force picture by forming a new, European "power center" that 
would be fully competitive with America and Russia. 
  For Russia this means that it is necessary to safeguard the 
security of its European borders in light of the fact that these 
will be borders with a united Europe. "The border between 
Europe and Russia is an obligatory measure in order to avert the 
possible emergence in Russia of a temptation to move against the 
West," [prodvinutsya na zapad], Guy Sorman, the well-known 
French political scientist and economist, believes, expressing a 
view that is widespread among the European political elite. The 
active attempts by certain NATO and EC forces to integrate 
Central European countries -- Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, and so forth -- into their structures should also be 
seen as part of this concept. 
  "A strong and independent Europe should be created not 
against Russia but without Russia" -- that assertion of Sorman's 
could reasonably claim to be the fundamental slogan of 
European policy in the foreseeable future. It is no 
accident that the talk of a "united European home" and a "Europe 
from the Atlantic to the Urals" -- which Western leaders used to 
love using with Gorbachev -- came to nothing so quickly. 
  Even the remaining supporters of a "big Europe" involving 
Russia see such a geopolitical combination merely as a means of 
restraining the Russian giant's development. "Russia will 
become a fully healthy and viable great power 40 years late," 
Doctor Herbert Kraus, the Austrian political scientist and 
analyst, warns. "It is inevitable that it will rival and be 
predisposed to conflict with the EC.... If we want to save the 
next generation from this, we must start acting today. Right 
now we can peacefully defeat Russia, which is the key to the 
entire surrounding area.... We who are facing recession will 
obtain highly valuable technical material and a ready sales 
market!" 
  This group of factors, linked to the Soviet Union's loss of 
the Cold War and to the considerable shift in the geopolitical 
balance in the West's favor, could be termed a group of 
"purposeful changes," since it is the result of a deliberate 
policy pursued by the "developed countries" throughout the 
postwar era. This policy, in turn, undoubtedly has its 
historical roots in the West's centuries-old military, economic, 
and ideological practice of "containing the Russian threat." 
This traditionally meant that the Russian state should follow 
their national interests. 
  It would be logical and entirely justifiable today if the 
new Russian military doctrine stipulated that its Armed Forces 
had the capability to counter new military threats on the 
continent.... 
  The "purposeful change" factors by no means exhaust the 
results of the global changes of recent years. The most 
powerful "side effect" of the weakening of the historical 
Russian "power center" has been the controlled growth in 
regional threats, which are now casting doubt on the ability of 
the Cold War "winners" to respond appropriately, and are 
threatening to nullify all the strategic advantages won by the 
West during the Soviet "perestroyka" era. 
  Quite recently U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin admitted at 
a 
press conference that the end of the Cold War, contrary to 
expectations, had made the world even more vulnerable than 
before. "The old Soviet threat, although very dangerous, made 
for a certain degree of comfort," he stated. "The old 
principles worked very well...." But these principles do not 
work under the new conditions of universal regional instability, 
and the Pentagon has been forced to urgently revise the concept 
for the use of its strategic nuclear forces, since under the new 
conditions this concept has become virtually meaningless." [no 
opening quotation marks as published] 
  "We are all facing one common problem today -- growing 
global 
discord," Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former U.S. national security 
adviser, warns. The latest book by this analyst who is 
influential in world circles is entitled "Out of Control. 
Global Turmoil on the Eve of the 21st Century." It is imbued 
with a sense of acute alarm about the avalanche of 
uncontrollable changes that are occurring. 
  And the geopolitical bloc which we are accustomed to calling 
the "West," which seemed monolithic during the period of tough 
anti-Soviet confrontation, is starting to display internal 
cracks. The many centuries of infighting among the European 
powers, which ended in the 20th century in two terrible world 
wars, did not disappear in the face of the "Soviet threat" but 
merely took a back seat. Today, on the eve of a major new 
rearrangement of spheres of influence, this infighting is again 
making itself felt -- and so actively that it is calling into 
question the effectiveness of the mechanisms to create a "united 
Europe." 
  Moreover, many analysts specializing in elaborating 
predictions about the changes in the geopolitical sphere are 
pointing to the fact that by the end of the century there will 
be an exacerbation of the United States' relations not only with 
China and India but with its current allies -- Germany and 
Japan. Their claims are based on the fact that the U.S. economy 
will continue to be uncompetitive against the German and 
Japanese economies not only in the European and Asian markets 
but in the traditional American market too. The United States 
will have no way to resolve this conflict other than by 
political and military means. And the possibility of Russia's 
being involved -- on the American side, of course -- in 
"pacifying the recalcitrants" cannot be ruled out. 
  In a recent interview Margaret Thatcher expressed the 
conviction that the Maastricht Treaty would "inevitably lead to 
the establishment of German domination of Europe." According to 
the "Iron Lady," this frightens her a lot, because she believes 
that Germany has never abandoned the idea of achieving world 
domination and that "the Germans are very stubborn people who 
ultimately always get what they want." The united German 
colossus alarms French politicians just as much, although they 
try not to advertise the fact. 
  A major factor in any possible global destabilization 
remains 
Islamic fundamentalism, which is rooted, apart from the 
religious sphere, in the Muslim peoples' natural indignation at 
interference by the "developed countries" -- above all, the 
United States -- in their internal affairs. There is a growing 
environmental crisis, and world conflict is increasing after 
"simmering" for many years between the rich, prosperous North 
and the hungry, poor, debt-laden South. 
  Thus, along with the controllable factors of "purposeful 
change," the geopolitical and military-strategic sphere is being 
influenced increasingly strongly by the virtually uncontrolled 
group of "risk factors," which are a consequence of the overall 
destabilization of the international situation and constitute a 
major obstacle to a predictable, evolutionary development of 
events. The struggle between these two trends will, clearly, 
continue to determine the direction of world politics in the 
next few years. 
  There is only one force in the modern world capable of 
decisively influencing this struggle. In the military-political 
sphere it is implemented through a range of measures aimed at 
universally establishing a "new world order." And its basic 
structures are international, supranational, and suprastate 
organizations -- first and foremost, the United Nations with all 
its subsidiary and ancillary institutions. 
  The ultimate aim of the cosmopolitan elite comprising the 
organizational nucleus of the "new world order" is to create a 
unified global network of planetary control -- a kind of world 
superstate run from a united center and enjoying legal priority 
over "local" legislation. 
  The world's press is actively discussing the question of the 
"legitimate basis for intervention." All this makes it possible 
to assume that the trend toward the forcible limitation of the 
state sovereignty of "disobedient" countries will be developed 
and honed in the very near future. 
  Moreover, it is necessary to clearly understand that the 
"developed countries" today see the "new world order" primarily 
as a way to reinforce their leading position in the 
international community. Nonetheless, it is obvious that at 
some point the processes of global political integration will 
conflict with the interests of the national state elites in 
these very countries -- the United States, Germany, or Japan. 
If the world's behind the scenes powers directing the 
integration processes succeed in overcoming this conflict, their 
entire might will be thrown into controlling further "purposeful 
changes" in the geopolitical and military-strategic spheres in 
the context of the "new world order." But if they fail, it is 
quite possible that the world's elites will use all their 
influence to expedite the strengthening of "risk factors" with a 
view to "detonating" the situation, exploiting the results of 
the general turmoil, and achieving at a time of global crisis 
what had proved impossible under an evolutionary development of 
events. 
  On the basis of all this it seems logical and justifiable 
that the political foundations of Russia's defense doctrine 
should be laid down, taking account above all of the following 
provisions: 
  The qualitatively different geopolitical and 
military-strategic situation requires a radical and 
comprehensive reevaluation of the military doctrine of the 
"Soviet period," which was based on the bipolar system of a 
world balance of power. The abandonment of the excessive 
geopolitical ambitions which exhausted the country's economy and 
were often dictated not by its national, state, or historical 
interests but by ideological claims to the rapid "victory of 
world socialism," presupposes the active reorientation of the 
Armed Forces to the priority of confronting regional threats to 
our security. Provided, of course, that we unconditionally 
maintain our strategic military potential at a level where it 
can guarantee to inflict "unacceptable damage" on any potential 
aggressor. 
  At the same time, the historical continuity of our 
"patriotic 
defense mentality" in all its spheres -- from military-political 
theory to military-strategic practice -- should also be ensured. 
In reality this means recognizing that Russia's security could 
continue to be safeguarded only in the event of its Armed 
Forces' being ready to independently and effectively counter the 
full range of potential force threats -- from the global to the 
regional, local, and even internal. 
  2. [no number 1 as published] The prospects for military 
organizational development should take proper account of the 
alarming trends in international politics. Analysis shows that 
in the foreseeable future the military-political situation in 
the world will be defined by collaboration and confrontation 
between the three such trends which we previously dubbed 
"factors of purposeful change," "risk factors," and "new world 
order factors." Not one of these trends is favorable for Russia, 
coincides with its long-term economic, political, or military 
interests, or promises us anything new in the future other than 
more unrest, worry, and diverse threats. And a readiness to use 
force to counter such threats, along with a vigorous 
peacekeeping policy to avert them, seems to be the most 
effective combination of the various means of safeguarding 
Russian security. 
  3. The Russian military strategy that has been adopted in 
the light of present-day conditions can be characterized on the 
whole as a strategy of "defense sufficiency" founded on the 
political basis of "healthy national pragmatism." This means 
that: 
  a) The immediate period of Russian development should be 
seen primarily as a period of stabilization during which it will 
be necessary above all to minimize the damage done to the 
country by the ill-conceived and undistinguished actions of 
politicians over the past few years; mechanisms for mobilizing 
all of society's potential with a view to getting the country 
out of its profound systemic crisis as quickly as possible will 
have to be elaborated; priority attention to the internal 
problems of social revival and national regeneration will have 
to be guaranteed; any kind of external state activeness will 
have to be reduced to a necessary minimum to rule out the 
possibility of Russia's getting dragged into the activities of 
any supranational international organizations whatsoever which 
claim a right to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign 
states; and the military activeness of the country's Armed 
Forces will have to be very strictly limited to the framework of 
Russia's national interests, for the purposes of whose 
protection they should have the necessary technical, 
organizational, and legal base. 
  b) The material and personnel resources channeled into 
defense should be determined on the basis that the most 
important task in this sphere is to prevent any further 
deterioration in Russia's military-political and 
military-strategic positions in the world arena. The events of 
recent years have revealed that we lack reliable military 
allies, therefore the priority avenue of military organizational 
development should be to safeguard the country's security 
against both direct military aggression against it and regional 
threats associated with local areas of military-political 
instability escalating into the threat of a comprehensive 
geopolitical crisis ("global turmoil"). 
  4. Along with the concepts of "healthy national pragmatism" 
and "defense sufficiency" the key terms in the Russian military 
doctrine, defining its practical features, could now be the 
concepts of "vital interests" and "potential enemy." It would 
be expedient to introduce the latter term in place of the term 
"probable enemy," which was discredited during the Cold War. If 
the term "probable enemy" is taken to mean states or alliances 
of states that were viewed as hostile in the unjustifiably 
ideologized system of references that prevailed earlier, then 
the concept of a "potential enemy" could be stripped of its 
"state affiliations" and acquire a concrete meaning independent 
of ideological predilections -- exclusively in conjunction with 
detailed and justifiable military-political forecasts. 
  The existence of potential military threats in the modern 
world is obvious and generally accepted. Consequently, the 
introduction of the proposed term should not unjustifiably 
concern anyone since it does not affect the overall defensive 
nature of our military doctrine. At the same time, it makes the 
processes of shaping specific aspects of the state's military 
policy and the day-to-day combat training of Russia's Armed 
Forces substantially easier. 
  In turn, the concept of "vital interests" makes it possible 
to render the military organizational development process clear 
and purposeful wherever its requirements cannot be adequately 
reflected with the help of the simple "potential enemy" 
definition. These interests -- understood to be Russia's 
legitimate right to stake a claim to a geopolitical or regional 
balance of power which would safeguard its security and 
territorial integrity -- can exist in areas where a "potential 
enemy" is simply absent. They may also be made the basis of our 
military policy in areas where friendly relations with local 
states, mutual loyalty, or other factors rule out the 
possibility of any other view being taken of the situation and 
require a flexible approach to the safeguarding of Russian 
security.... 
  It would be naive to believe that this brief review could 
cover all of today's military-political problems. Moreover, 
Russia's current position is so vague and complex, so unstable 
and changeable, that any claims that the highly important 
provisions determining the country's military security which we 
have tried to formulate here are final would look very dubious. 
Nonetheless, it is necessary to define right now the future 
basis for our defense doctrine, to outline its specific forms, 
and to map out the general direction of its evolution. 
  It is the specialists' job to elaborate the 
military-strategic and military-technical aspects of military 
doctrine, it is the politicians' duty to elaborate the 
military-political provisions. 
  But we must not refrain from emphasizing that the Russian 
Army's future lies solely in its link with the people [v yeye 
narodnosti]. No mercenary force -- and this is demonstrated by 
the experience of manpower acquisition for the Special-Purpose 
Militia Detachment -- is capable of defending the people or of 
winning their support. 
  We are obliged to preserve universal military service for 
Russia's citizens. We are compelled by life itself to foster in 
Russian citizens a sense of patriotism, pride in their 
motherland, and a readiness to defend it. We must preserve and 
augment the state's defense capability and the Army's combat 
readiness. It is necessary to clear away many obstacles and 
"democratic" prejudices in this area.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Dolinin "Reportage for This Issue": "`First Aid' </F>
for Missiles" -- first three paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Hundreds of ballistic missiles "held" by the 
Strategic Missile Forces are on alert duty in Russia. Russian 
missilemen also have a headache over the launchers stationed in 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. They have plenty of trouble 
with this whole "nuclear missile business." 
  Missiles, which are packed full of electronics and fuel and 
have nuclear warheads, require constant surveillance and care, 
particularly in the event of the aging and the malfunctions 
which are making themselves felt increasingly clearly today, 
given the meager funding, depleted spare parts, tools, and 
accessories kits, the destroyed collaboration within the former 
Union, the customs obstacles.... 
  In these conditions specialists locally and at the 
operational-technical control center of the Strategic Missile 
Forces, which our correspondent visited, are operating a "first 
aid" system. 
  Operational-technical control centers appeared in the 
Strategic Missile Forces High Command and in missile large 
strategic formations and combined units several years ago. They 
proved their viability in auspicious times, and in the present 
times -- with universal shortages -- they have proved simply 
essential. 
  "Such a center in the Strategic Missile Forces High 
Command," 
Lieutenant General Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander in chief, 
believes, "is the eyes and ears of the forces' leadership. Here 
measures are taken to rectify the simplest fault in missile 
hardware and, if necessary, major technical decisions are worked 
out." 
  The center itself is housed in small, well-equipped 
premises. 
Nothing here is superfluous. Showing me round his facility, Lt. 
Colonel Mikhail Poludnitsyn, the center's chief, drew attention 
to the alert-duty personnel's posts and the collective 
electronic panel. The latter highlights information on the 
faults which have arisen, down to each individual launcher, 
gives their characteristics, and shows the time of reinstatement 
of "indisposed" missiles and protection systems. All this is 
conveyed via a computer link to the display units of chiefs of 
directorates and services. 
  The alert-duty personnel are headed by Col. Yuriy Surnin, 
who 
is assisted by two Alekseys -- Captain Kotlyarevskiy and Senior 
Lt. Klychnikov. Col. Vladimir Bezgreshnov, preparing to take 
Surnin's place, unhurriedly bones up on the situation. 
Engineers are on duty round the clock, being operationally 
subordinate to the Strategic Missile Forces Central Command Post. 
  I asked Surnin to assess the condition of the missile 
armament and hardware over the past 24 hours. 
  "Twenty launchers (more than half of them outside Russia) 
required prompt [operativnyy] intervention," he said. "On one, 
for example, an instrument has failed." On this score he 
reported: Measures have been taken, and the instrument is being 
delivered to the launcher by courier from a store in one of the 
divisions. The alert-duty personnel knew the train's number and 
were monitoring the officer's time of arrival in the unit and 
the hardware's readiness to receive him. 
  "We strive for stability, operational efficiency, secrecy, 
and continuity in the center's activity," Lt. Col. Poludnitsyn 
emphasized. 
  This is achieved not only by constant alert duty but also by 
means of the planning meetings conducted on a daily basis by Lt. 
Gen. Anatoliy Perminov, chief of the Main Directorate for the 
Operation of Missile Armament, and on Saturdays by Lt. Gen. 
Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander in chief, directly at the 
operational-technical control center 
  Invited to the meetings are leading specialists of main 
directorates and officers of the state technical supervision, 
communications, the motor vehicle service.... Such 
representation has entirely justified itself. This staff of 
professionals resolves all problems. It is only when these fall 
outside the competence of the deputy commander in chief that 
direct application is made to the commander in chief of the 
Strategic Missile Forces himself. 
  The Saturday conference at the center was held in a calm 
working regime, but you could sense the anxiety and inner 
tension of the people gathered there. There are quite a few 
problems in Russia, so it turned out, and things are still more 
difficult in the event of equipment malfunctions in Ukraine. 
There are more malfunctions in just two missile divisions there 
than in all the Missile Forces. Technical decisions on them 
have been worked out in good time, and the Ukrainian side has 
not rejected them; but it cannot implement them. There are not 
the material and financial means or even the fuel to enable the 
routine inspection and maintenance crews to travel to the 
launchers. 
  Problems also arise in the divisions in Kazakhstan. For 
example, instruments intended for the automated systems for the 
protection of nuclear weapons are not allowed through customs. 
Whether they like it or not, the "technical personnel" are also 
required to be diplomats and prepare requests to the Main 
Customs Administration. 
  On visiting the operational-technical control center I saw 
for myself that an unwritten law exists among the missilemen: 
Don't leave a missile until a malfunction has been rectified. 
Those on duty in the control center and those who work with a 
wrench directly in a combat position really are like "first aid" 
for nuclear missile weapons.

<F P=106> [Colonel Gennadiy Miranovich article: "Reforming the Armed </F>
Forces: What Is Planned for 1994"] 
  [Text] Looking back over what has been done already in the 
course of the reforms begun in the Army and Navy in 1992, you 
suddenly discover with satisfaction that, despite everything, we 
are advancing steadily and consistently along the planned path. 
You will agree that against a background abounding with examples 
of the failure to oblige or to display assiduity, including on 
questions of state importance, this appears encouraging. 
  I will remind you that it was planned to form the Russian 
Armed Forces in three stages, over six or maybe even eight 
years. In particular, at the first stage (during 1992) it was 
proposed: 
  -- to create the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense; 
  -- to create the legal basis of the building and functioning 
of the Armed Forces; 
  -- to elaborate the structure, combat composition, and 
groupings of the Armed Forces; 
  -- to withdraw to Russia's territory the troops under its 
jurisdiction; 
  -- to complete the formation of administrative agencies of 
the Armed Forces. 
  The creation of the Defense Ministry was the priority area 
in 
all this work in 1992. As is known, the Russian Federation 
president approved the statute on it 27 July. By that time (the 
end of July) the elaboration of the structures of the Armed 
Forces for the next few years and the longer term was 
practically complete, the complexion of the ministry itself had 
been decided, and the basis of the concept of the organizational 
development of the Armed Forces had been drawn up. 
  In addition, a thorough and objective stocktaking of 
existing 
arms and hardware was carried out in 1992. The status of the 
Russian troops stationed outside the country was decided at an 
interstate level. In addition to their withdrawal to Russian 
territory, there was a planned reduction in the numbers of 
personnel, arms, and military hardware. The fundamentals of the 
legal basis of the organizational development and functioning of 
the Armed Forces were also drawn up. In August 1992 the Ural 
Military District was reinstated, the reforming of a number of 
other districts was begun.... 
  Thus, by the end of the first stage of the formation of the 
Russian Armed Forces we already had quite a clear idea of their 
structure and, most importantly, we had bodies capable of 
administering them. At the same time the Defense Ministry's new 
structure is fundamentally different from the previous one. 
Above all, in terms of a clearer demarcation of functions 
within the central apparatus, which by November 1992 had been 
reduced by more than 30 percent (approximately 6,000 people). 
Some 140 generals' posts, 41 directorates, and 140 departments 
and sectors had been abolished. Directorates of the high 
commands of troops of sectors, of the Turkestan Military 
District, of two armies of the Transcaucasus Military District, 
and of several divisions and military schools had also ceased to 
exist. By the end of the year the strength of the Armed Forces 
as a whole had fallen by more than 200,000 men. 
  As we have already told our readers, the tasks at the second 
stage (1993-1994) of the formation of the Russian Armed Forces 
are: 
  -- to complete, in the main, the withdrawal of Russian 
troops 
from other territories; 
  -- to reduce and reform the troops (forces) and to create a 
military infrastructure on Russian territory; 
  -- to create and enshrine in legislation a system of social 
guarantees for servicemen, members of their families, and 
persons discharged from military service into the reserve or 
into retirement (including ahead of schedule); 
  -- to go over to a mixed system of manning the Army and Navy 
with personnel; 
  -- to introduce alternative service. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's readers have been informed about the way 
these tasks were resolved in 1993. With the withdrawal of 
troops from East European countries, as is known, the first 
strategic defense echelon of the former Soviet Union ceased to 
exist. Troops of the second echelon have pulled back to Ukraine 
and Belarus, and their withdrawal from the Baltic region is 
continuing. As a result, military districts which had been 
internal -- Moscow, Leningrad, and North Caucasus -- have become 
border districts. The Ural and Volga Military Districts are 
becoming a base for the preparation of mobilization resources 
and a basis for creating a new operational-strategic formation. 
  The withdrawal of Russian troops from other territories will 
continue this year. In particular, it is planned to withdraw 
250,000 servicemen and approximately 120,000 units of diverse 
hardware from the Western and Northwestern Groups of Forces, the 
Transcaucasus, and the Baltic countries. It is proposed that 
this process can be completed before 1 September. 
  In connection with the aforementioned changes in the 
military-strategic situation and the troop withdrawal the work 
on creating troop groupings and a military infrastructure on 
Russian territory, on improving their organization and 
establishment, and on equipping them with modern hardware and 
armament will naturally be continued. 
  Consequently, groupings of conventional armed forces will 
essentially be created anew on Russian territory before 1995. 
At the same time there is to be a sharp reduction in the 
overall number of large strategic formations and combined units. 
In the opinion of experts, the groupings which are being 
created will be capable of repulsing aggression in local and 
regional wars and military conflicts. In the event of a 
large-scale war being unleashed, they will be capable of 
ensuring the strategic deployment of the Armed Forces. The 
existing structures of the Armed Forces (Strategic Missile 
Forces, Ground Forces, Air Defense Forces, Air Force, Navy) and 
the way the Russian Federation's territory is divided up from 
military-administrative perspective will be preserved for the 
time being. 
  The priority tasks for 1994 include the creation of mobile 
forces capable of quickly being transferred, being deployed, and 
conducting mobile combat operations in any direction and in any 
region where a threat to Russia's military security arises. 
  It cannot be ruled out that that the arrnagements for and 
planning of the organizational development of the Armed Forces 
will be determined more precisely, taking account of the state 
system of planning that is taking shape and economic and other 
realities. 
  The switch to the mixed method of manning the Army and Navy 
began in 1993. According to General Staff data, contract 
servicemen already hold one post in every seven among those 
manned by privates, sergeants, and petty officers. This year 
they are to make up 30 percent of the Armed Forces' total 
personnel strength. Posts which determine the combat 
effectiveness of units and ships and also troops fulfilling 
peacemaking functions will primarily be manned by specialists 
volunteering for military service under contract. Naturally, 
the quality of this contingent will largely depend on those who 
recruit volunteers and, in particular, on their ability to 
prevent persons whose moral and professional qualities are poor 
from finding their way into the military. 
  At the same time the continuation of the policy of 
professionalizing the Army will require the allocation of new 
targeted budget appropriations, the drawing up of new normative 
acts, etc. 
  In general, in terms of the organizational development of 
the 
Armed Forces, 1994 will be remarkable for the fact that we 
already have a practically full "military package" of laws, 
right down to the general military regulations. The "Main 
Provisions of the Russian Federation's Military Doctrine," 
adopted at the end of last year, make the work of shaping the 
Armed Forces still more focused not only in the political and 
strictly military respects, but also as regards 
military-technical and economic aspects. All this certainly 
does not mean, however, that the new parliament no longer has 
anything to do in the sphere of military legislation. Rather, 
on the contrary, life is posing more and more new tasks here. 
These include, incidentally, the introduction of alternative 
service planned for the second stage of shaping the Armed Forces.

Romanenkova] 
  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- For the first time in the 
history of Russian cosmonautics a space crew will miss one 
back-up astronaut when it blasts off on January 8 for a 
rendezvous with the orbiting stations Mir. 
  The state commission has removed German Arzamazov from the 
stand- by crew in which he was included as a medical researcher, 
following his statement opposing the candidature of Valeriy 
Polyakov as a member of the main crew. Arzamazov vowed that 
Polyakov had not practiced medicine for a long time and 
therefore cannot fly as a medical researcher. He offered his 
own candidature. 
  However, Vasiliy Agapov, Russian deputy health minister, 
believes that Polyakov is a highly skilled professional who has 
been working as a deputy director of the institute of medical 
and biological problems for a long time. Additionally, he has 
spent 241 days in space. 
  During the flight, Polyakov will carry out medical 
experiments on himself. As for Arzamazov, he has developed some 
"psychological problems" in relations with his colleagues. 
Besides, he has never been in space before, Agapov said. 
  The deputy minister said that taking account Arzamazov's 
experience -- he has been in the cosmonauts's team for 17 years 
and been included in stand-by crews twice, -- he may be included 
as a crew member for the future Russian-American joint space 
flight. 
  Agapov stressed that according to the standing rules, the 
entire crew has to be replaced if one of its members is removed. 
However, in this particular case, because of the extraordinary 
nature of the situation, a "reserve cosmonaut" has been prepared 
for a flight "in case of emergency."

Ivanov] 
  [Text] Moscow January 7 TASS -- Twenty-four hours are left 
before the start of the 15th main space expedition to the "Mir" 
orbital station. It is scheduled for 13.05 minutes 32 seconds 
Moscow time, January 8. 
  A "Soyuz TM-18" vehicle with three cosmonauts on board is to 
be orbited by Russian military-space forces from the Baykonur 
cosmodrome. The rocket is already in position on the launching 
pad. A meeting of the state commission is to endorse the main 
and stand- by crews today. 
  At present, the main crew includes Viktor Afanasyev 
(commander of the vehicle), Yuriy Usachev (board engineer), and 
Valeriy Polyakov (research cosmonaut, physician). The stand-by 
crew includes Yuriy Malenchenko (commander) and Tolgat 
Musabayev (kazakh board engineer). The docking of the "Soyuz 
TM-18" vehicles with the "Mir" orbital complex is to take place 
at 14 hours 50 minutes Moscow time on January 10 (plus-minus 10 
minutes). 
  The members of the 15th main expedition will work on board 
the station for three days together with the crew of the 14th 
main expedition -- Vasiliy Tsybliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov, who 
began their orbital flight on July 1st, 1993. Tsybliyev and 
Serebrov had to remain on orbit for 146 days (until November 24, 
1993), but due to difficulties with the timely delivery of 
carrier-rockets for the "Mir" complex, the crew's stay on the 
orbit was prolonged for 200 days (until January 17, 1994). The 
cosmonauts agreed to this prolongation. And now the landing 
capsule of the "Soyuz TM-17" transport vehicle is expected to 
touch down at 11 hours 25 minutes Moscow time, January 14. 
  Tsybliyev and Serebrov have made five exits into open space 
in the course of the flight, remaining there for a total of 14 
hours 2 minutes. The implementation of the planned research 
programme and experiments was impeded by the limited financing 
of technological, biotechnological, geophysical and applied 
studies. Therefore, priority attention had to be given to 
research carried out on the commercial basis (for instance, 
nature studies and ecological research carried out to German and 
American orders), to astrophysical experiments ordered by the 
space research institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and 
also to works needed to draw up a target programme for the 
"Mir-2" station. 
  The 15th main expedition is to stay on the orbit for 179 
days 
(up to july 4). But the research cosmonaut (physician) will 
remain on the orbit for a much longer period -- 427 days. He 
will play host to two more expeditions on board the "Mir" 
station this year, first to the 16th expedition which is to last 
for 135 days (from June 22 to November 2), and to the 17th 
expedition, which is to last 157 days (from October 3). The 
17th main expedition will include a representative from the 
European Space Agency. 
  The experiments that are to be carried out during the 15th 
main expedition will focus on medical research. No exits into 
the open space are planned. Supplies to the "Mir" station will 
be brought by three cargo "Progress M" transport vehicles.

  [Text] Moscow January 8 TASS -- The programme of the 15th 
main expedition to the Mir orbital complex, started today, which 
is made up of Mission Commander Viktor Afanasyev, Flight 
Engineer Yuriy Usachev and Cosmonaut Researcher and Physician 
Valeriy Polyakov, is going to be very intensive. 
  On January 10 the spacecraft is planned to be docked with 
the 
Mir orbital complex. For three days the crews of two 
expeditions -- the 14th expedition (Vasili Tsibiliev and 
Aleksandr Serebrov) and the 15th expedition -- will be working 
there. On January 14 Tsibiliev and Serebrov will return to the 
Earth on board the Soyuz TM-17 spacecraft. Afanasyev, Usachev 
and Polyakov will work at the Mir complex for 179 days. 
  The fact that the crew includes a professional medic is the 
characteristic feature of the expedition. He is going to set 
the record of the longest stay of man in outer space and to 
spend more than a year at the orbital complex (429 days). 
Polyakov will work as a member of the 15th, 16th and 17th main 
expeditions. 
  A number of medical experiments will be conducted during the 
current space mission. Special attention will be devoted to the 
medical and sanitary-hygienic aspects of super-long space 
flights, including the future space expeditions to Mars, as well 
as to methods of offsetting the negative impact of 
weightlessness on human body during long flights. 
  During the simultaneous work of the two crews a series of 
biotechnological experiments will be conducted, so that 
Tsibiliev and Serebrov will be able to bring their results to 
the Earth. 
  Afanasyev, Usachev and Polyakov will conduct some 
technological experiments in the sphere of crystallography, the 
study of the impact of vacuum on various materials, and to 
continue astrophysical studies and the long-distance sounding of 
the Earth. The work on geological anomalies will be resumed. 
The study from outer space of the emergence and development of 
typhoons in various parts of the world ocean is going to be very 
interesting. No space walkouts are planned. 
  The crew will receive three cargo spacecraft, one of which 
will have a ballistic capsule to be returned to the Earth. 
Planned repair and maintenance work will be continued in order 
to keep the Mir complex in a proper condition.

  [Text] Moscow January 9 TASS -- A spacecraft carrying three 
Russian cosmonauts blasted off from the Baykonur space centre in 
Kazakhstan on Saturday with just a two-second delay, proving 
that the Russian cosmonautics lives up to the standard despite 
financial hardships. 
  The flight will mark a record-breaking mission on orbit due 
to last a year and two months. Researcher Valeriy Polyakov will 
spend 429 days aboard Russia's orbiting station Mir carrying out 
medical experiments. The two other cosmonauts, Viktor afanasyev 
and Yuriy Usachov, will replace their colleagues, Vasiliy 
Tsibiliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov who will return to earth on 
January 14. 
  During the expedition, the cosmonauts will carry out a 
series 
of medical and biological experiments. Special attention will 
be devoted to the medical and sanitary-hygienic aspects of 
super-long space flights, including the future space expeditions 
to Mars, as well as to methods of offsetting the negative impact 
of weightlessness on human body during long flights. 
  During the simultaneous work of the two crews a series of

  The crew will receive three cargo spacecraft, one of which 
will have a ballistic capsule to be returned to the earth. 
Planned repair and maintenance work will be continued in order 
to keep up the Mir complex in a proper condition. 
  The experiments will provide invaluable scientific material 
for designing and building a new orbiting station, tentatively 
called Alpha, which is expected to be put in orbit after 1997, 
which will mark the beginning of an era of manned space 
programmes in world astronautics. An agreement to build such a 
station has been signed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice-President Al Gore.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 8 Jan--The Russians have once again 
amazed everyone by their precision: the launching of the 
spacecraft "Soyuz TM-18"--planned for 13 hours 05 minutes 32 
seconds--was carried out with only a two-second delay, whereas 
the permissible divergence from the launch time is plus-minus 60 
seconds. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the Russian cosmonauts and their colleagues from 
other countries will have to work on the Russian "Mir" station. 
It is true that the shortage of funds has had its effect on the 
state of the orbital complex. Launched in 1986, the station was 
meant to exist in orbit for five years. The shortage of funds, 
however, has lead to the fact that setting up a substitute--the 
"Mir-2" station-- has been delayed. Regular work is being 
carried out on "Mir" to prolong its "life". 
  The "old age" of the station is already having a negative 
effect. It was noted at one of the latest sessions of the 
interstate committee that 661 defects have been revealed, 
including 18 during the period of the 14th main expedition (from 
1 July 1993). However, these defects do not pose any direct 
threat to the safety of the crew. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tartu, Estonia, Jan 07, BNS -- The replacement of 
ministers in the Cabinet is absolutely normal and essential for 
improving the work of the ministries and the government as a 
whole, said Tonis Lukas, deputy chairman of the Pro Patria party. 
  Lukas, who heads the Tartu section of the senior party in 
the 
country's ruling coalition, said there were no reasons of 
ideological character behind the changes in the Cabinet. 
  He said the planned replacement of Toomas Sildmae, the 
minister of the economy, was necessary because of shortcomings 
in the ministry's work on drawing up legislation. He said it had 
been the ruling coalition's Pro Patria and National Independence 
Party parliament factions that were most dissatisfied with the 
ministry's work under Sildmae. Lukas added that the ruling 
parties had been at one with Sildmae over the economic policy. 
  Sildmae, who entered the political government from the 
country's young business elite, is receiving continuous support 
from the industrial and business circles, who say Sildmae's 
replacement as minister would negatively affect the economy. 
  Commenting on possible problems related to Sildmae's 
quitting 
the office, Lukas said he was still not quite sure that all the 
four ministers would be replaced. 
  Lukas said the appointment of Defense Minister Juri Luik to 
take over as the foreign minister was called by the need to gain 
better control over different departments in the Foreign 
Ministry and make the ministry work more effectively. 
  "As far as I know it was the wish of (Prime Minister) Laar, 
Luik, as well as President Meri that Luik be removed from the 
office of the defense minister," Lukas added. 
  He said that the issue of replacing Finance Minister Madis 
Uurike had "stood long on the agenda." 
  "When all ministers cope with their work and the government 
works well together, the government's popularity will rise," he 
said. 
  "I consider the government repair a practical step without 
any ideological background," Lukas mentioned. "It is high time 
for the people to get used to such steps," he added.

  [Text] A working meeting of the prime ministers of five 
Central Asian countries started in the Uzbek town of Nukus 
Monday [10 January]. 
  The presidents of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan are expected to hold a meeting 
there on January 11. This meeting will continue the work 
started in Kyzyl-Orda last March when the leaders of the five 
countries agreed on joint action to rescue the Aral Sea and help 
the coastal areas. 
  The coordination committee of the Central Asian countries 
has 
drafted numerous documents for this meeting, notably guidelines 
on the interstate council and its executive committee and a 
concept of ways to revive the Aral Sea. 
  Informed sources close to the Uzbek government told Interfax 
that the leaders of the Central Asian republics would discuss 
numerous economic problems in introduction of national 
currencies when they meet in Nukus. Cooperation in the 
ecological or any other sphere is impossible unless these 
problems are resolved, the sources believe.

  [Text] On Friday morning Armenian formations supported by 
armored vehicles made fruitless attempts to return their 
positions in Azerbaijan's south lost the day before, a source in 
Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry reported to Interfax. 
  As Baku asserts, on January 6 the Armenians left the village 
of Goradiz and several more populated centers in Azerbaijan's 
Fizuli region. 
  Interfax interlocutor underlined that as a result of 
liberation of the village of Goradiz the blockade of the 
Nachichevan autonomous republic, a part of Azerbaijan which has 
not common borders with it, has been softened. In his words, 
vitally important shipments, including fuel and food products, 
can be carried out via this rail way junction to the autonomy 
along the Iranian territory. 
  The source has reported that a tank and a motor vehicle 
assigned to the headquarters of the southern grouping of the 
Karabakh forces were destroyed in the course of hostilities on 
January 7. 
  According to this source, the Azerbaijani army has managed 
to 
regain control over the 40-kilometer section of the Azerbaijani- 
Iranian border. 
  Meanwhile, Stepanakert has failed to reconfirm the 
information about the loss of the village of Goradiz.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina and Yulia </F>
Kantor] 
  [Text] January 10 ITAR-TASS -- Parliamentary groups and 
individual deputies must take political responsibility for any 
damage done to Russia's national and state interests, stability 
and peace by their pronouncements and actions, the parliamentary 
faction made up of members of the Russia's Choice electoral 
coalition said in a statement, which it adopted on January 9 and 
plans to submit for consideration of the State Duma as a 
legislative initiative, faction Chairman Yegor Gaydar told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  The statement was prompted by some actions and 
pronouncements 
of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal Democratic 
Party which has the largest single faction in Russia's new 
parliament. According to Yegor Gaydar, these prononcements and 
calls fall clearly within the scope of those articles in the 
criminal code of the Russian Federation which outlaw the 
propaganda of war. "We will raise a question about due legal 
assessment of violations of this ban," Gaydar said. 
  He was evidently referring to Zhirinovskiy's threats to 
Germany, Europe and NATO, and Gaydar's Deputy Boris Zolotukhin 
said a call for war was unmistakable in Zhirinovskiy's book "The 
Last Push to the South". 
  According to Gaydar, Russia's Choice reached an agreement 
about solidary voting of 94 faction members in the parliament, 
whenever a decision on such voting is adopted by a two-third 
majority of faction members. 
  As concerns interfaction cooperation, Russia's Choice tends 
to interact with all factions in the State Duma's bodies, but 
"is unable to collude with the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia, Communists and Agrarians against other parties". Gaydar 
expressed apprehension that these factions may seek to "usurp 
control over the key committees and commissions of the State 
Duma, in particular, over the commission in charge of defence 
and international relations." 
  As concerns the constructive programme of Russia's Choice, 
the faction has prepared a package of initiatives in the field 
of social and economic policy, including initiatives in the 
housing sphere. 
  The new parliament's law-making activity should focus on 
this 
key issue of the development of society, Gaydar said. He added 
that his faction has worked out proposals for legal and economic 
guarantees of the freedom of the press. 
  The faction Secretary Sergey Yushenkov said in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS that the faction fully supports the journalists' 
demand that the government resolution be repealed before the 
prices of periodicals increase six-fold. 
  As concerns relations between faction and the government, 
Gaydar distanced himself from the cabinet decisions which 
stipulated the expansion of subsidies to enterprises in 1993, 
and led to the increasing budget deficit and unjustified 
procurement of farming produce, all of which resulted in a 
financial crisis of the state. 
  Russia's Choice is planning to support in parliament those 
members of the government who share the faction's objectives. 
  Gaydar said he has come to realize the need to establish a 
single party of liberal reforms to coordinate the activity of 
all democratic forces in Russia.

  [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, now on 
a visit to the Central Asian countries, has held wide-ranging 
talks in Tashkent with the Uzbek president, Mr. Islam Karimov. 
During the 90-minute meeting, they exchanged views on regional 
situation and bilateral relations. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali 
briefed President Karimov on the explosive situation in Kashmir 
and drew his attention to the massive human right violations 
being committed by Indian security forces in occupied Kashmir, 
especially the custodial deaths. He emphasized that the 
liberation movement in the Indian- held Kashmir cannot be 
characterized as terrorism. He also apprised the Uzbek 
president about the recent Pakistan-India foreign 
secretary-level talks which were unproductive due to Indian 
intransigence. 
  On the Afghanistan situation, Pakistan and Uzbekistan shared 
the view that the situation there is volatile. Sardar Asif 
Ahmad Ali briefed the Uzbek leader about Pakistan's continuing 
efforts to revive the process of conciliation for a lasting 
political settlement. They agreed that the continuing turmoil 
in Afghanistan poses a serious threat to regional peace and 
stability. 
  President Karimov expressed his country's keen interest in 
the development of road links between Pakistan and Uzbekistan 
via Afghanistan. The two countries are expected to reinvigorate 
the process of consultation within the framework of the 
Pakistan-Afghan-Uzbek memorandum of understanding. On bilateral 
matters, the Uzbek president conveyed his full support to 
strengthen bilateral cooperation with Pakistan in every field. 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali also held talks with his Uzbek 
counterpart, Mr. Saidmukhtar Saidqasymov. The two sides had a 
detailed review of bilateral issues and mutual cooperation in 
diverse areas of bilateral interest, including cooperation in 
the field of antiterrorism and antinarcotics. Uzbekistan also 
indicated its desire to open its embassy in Islamabad. Mr. 
Saidqasymov will be visiting Pakistan shortly at the invitation 
of Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali. Today the foreign minister is holding 
substantive talks with the Uzbek deputy prime minister and 
minister for foreign economic relations.

  [Text] Islam Karimov, the president of Uzbekistan, has 
issued a decree confirming model rules for collective farms. 
The document makes changes to the procedure for electing farm 
leaders. From now on, collective farmers are deprived of the 
right to independently nominate candidates for election to 
collective farm chairmen at general meetings. This can only be

last two years the number of collective farms in Uzbekistan has 
doubled.

  [Text] Last year's inflation rate in Uzbekistan reached 
1,000 percent because of excessive money supply and the shortage 
of consumer goods, an Uzbekistan senior banking official told 
INTERFAX. Minimal wages, pensions, and grants increased 
sevenfold in 1993 and their volume by 350-fold compared with 
1990, and average wages rose 320-fold, according to Uzbekistan's 
State Committee for Statistics.

Uzbekistan, no independent newspaper owned by its staff has been 
registered by the state committee for the press. 
  The five leading dailies were registered under the aegis of 
the Supreme Soviet and the government, President Karimov's 
People's Democratic Party (formerly communist) and the 
republican support fund for the press established under a 
presidential decree. Regional governments have become founders 
of local newspapers.

  [Text] Latvia's government refrained from a meeting with 
NATO officials planned to be held on January 7 to discuss the 
country's relations with the alliance. 
  As Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs has explained to 
INTERFAX, the cabinet found such a discussion "premature" before 
January 10, when NATO will open its summit. 
  Western leaders are to work out a common position toward the 
prospects of integration in the alliance of Central and East 
European states, the Baltic republics included. 
  As has been reported, President Algirdas Brazauskas of 
Lithuania formally applied to NATO for membership on Tuesday [4 
January].

  [Text] Riga, Jan 07, BNS -- Latvia will abstain from 
making an official application for the NATO membership until 
Aug. 31, the prospective deadline of the Russian troops' 
withdrawal, said Alexander Kirsteins, the head of the Saeima 
(parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  Latvia will, however, seek possibilities to sign bilateral 
military cooperation pacts with the alliance's member states, 
like the Jan. 3 accord with Denmark, Kirsteins said. 
  Kirsteins described as absurd a country's request for 
acceptance to the NATO while it is still occupied by a foreign 
army. 
  The Latvian government received an official invitation to 
join the NATO summit in Brussels next week, which is scheduled 
to consider the participation of the East European states to the 
Partnership for Peace program. 
  The Latvian army could act in the NATO framework regardless 
of its newness and poor ammunition, noted Kirsteins. 
  Latvia would have the chance right after the projected 
Baltic 
Peacekeeping Battalion receives budget funding, and Latvia and 
Russia reach a final accord on troops' withdrawal, said 
Kirsteins. 
  The Latvian army cannot expect the NATO to extend funds for 
the purchase of weapons unless the foreign troops are pulled out 
from its territory. 
  Kirsteins staunchly rejected any possibilities for Latvia to 
cooperate with Russia in the military sphere because Russia was 
presently "the sole military force threatening to the Latvian 
security." 
  As reported, the Latvian Foreign Ministry made a statement 
Jan. 5 urging the NATO to grant security guarantees to countries 
that expressed a wish to integrate into the organization. 
  Latvia puts a foreign political priority on political and 
military cooperation with the NATO and its separate member 
states to get accepted to the alliance in the future, the 
ministry said. 
  As reported, Lithuania officially asked for the NATO 
membership Jan. 4.

  [Text] Latvia's Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs told the 
BALTIC NEWS SERVICE news agency today that the United States had 
offered the Baltic states to replace the possibliity of becoming 
NATO member states with the possibility for cooperation which, 
although does not give guarantees of security, however, taking 
into account the results of the elections in Russia, the Baltic 
states can expect from NATO more stable guarantees of security 
in the nearest future [sentence as received]. 
  Only NATO can give the Baltic states guarantees of security. 
That is clear to all NATO member states. 
  According to Georgs Andrejevs, the joining of NATO by Latvia 
will be determined to a great extent by foreign policy of larger 
NATO member states in the nearest future. Latvia, similarly to 
Lithuania and Estonia, has expressed the wish to join NATO in 
the future, on the occasions of meetings of both prime ministers 
and presidents of the Baltic states on 15 December 1993. 
However, Latvia has not yet considered the possibility of 
passing a separate document on joining NATO, stated Georgs 
Andrejevs. 
  In a letter to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, 
signed 
by the Lithuanian president, there is a request to send to 
Lithuania a commission of NATO experts who will determine 
whether Lithuania can be admitted to NATO. But according to 
Andrejevs, Lithuania is not ready for admission to NATO. 
Latvia, for its part, has to tackle the issue of the withdrawal 
of the Russian Army from Latvian territory before it invites a 
commission of NATO experts. 
  As Andrejevs admitted, cooperation within the framework of 
the Partnership for Peace program, as the United States has 
envisaged it, already means the conclusion of bilateral 
agreements with NATO, and depending on the readiness of each 
state this agreement also envisages the opportunity to become a 
fully-fledged NATO member state. Thus, NATO can itself offer to 
join this organization, if cooperation within the framework of 
the peace program is successful and a country meets NATO's 
conditions in the military sphere.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 07, BNS -- The U.S.-proposed program for 
the cooperation of the East European states with the NATO "is 
not as concrete and clearly cut as this document should be," 
Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis told BNS. 
  In the Pavlovskis words, the program should provide clearer 
conditions and terms for the entrance of the states, signatories 
to the program, into the NATO. 
  Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup, who visited Riga 
earlier this week, already pledged Pavlovskis to do everything 
he could to amend the program, Pavlovskis said. 
  "My personal opinion is that Lithuania's application for the 
NATO membership was premature," Pavlovskis said. It prompted 
Russia to air its (negative) stance on the acceptance of the 
Central European countries to this organization with a pretext 
that the move could undermine the European security, the 
minister said. 
  Pavlovskis prognosticated that Western politicians would 
heed 
to Russia's anxiety in fear of the destabilization of the 
situation in Russia itself. 
  Subsequently, the Western leaders may refuse to amend the 
Partnership for Peace, said Pavlovskis. He also said he hoped 
his prognosis would not come true. 
  The East European security problems could be tackled much 
easier if "Europe guaranteed our security." Then, Eastern Europe 
could focus its efforts on the development of economy and 
democracy. Besides, the entrance to the NATO is very costly 
because the member states need good armament and equipment. 
  It would also be more advantageous for the NATO to grant the 
East European countries some security guarantees than to enroll 
new members. The motion would even benefit Russia by 
stabilizing the situation in its neighboring states.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 06, BNS - The CSCE high commissioner on 
ethnic minorities, Max van der Stoel, voiced new, constructive 
proposals for the resolution of the citizenship problem in 
Latvia, said parliament's speaker Anatolijs Gorbunovs. Van der 
Stoel is visiting Riga this week to discuss citizenship and 
ethnic minorities' problems with Latvian officials. 
  Under the proposals, Latvia should naturalize citizens' 
spouses and children, and ethnic Latvians who still lack 
citizenship in 1994 and 1995. 
  In 1996, citizenship should be offered to all permanent 
residents who speak Latvian and have lived here a certain number 
of years, recommended van der Stoel. The residence qualification 
could be 20, 30 or 40 years, he said. 
  This option, said van der Stoel, would not threaten the 
identity of the Latvian nation and would provide non-citizens 
with clearcut future prospects. 
  Van der Stoel criticized as too vague the naturalization 
mechanism in the ruling coalition's citizenship blueprint. The 
resident non-citizens may find it difficult to judge their 
prospects to ever get naturalized, the high commissioner said. 
  The Latvia's Way-Farmers' Union bill grants citizenship 
under 
a system of annual quotas. The government sets the quotas in 
compliance with the current economic and demographic situation 
to ensure the development of Latvia as a national state. The 
parliament passed the first reading of the bill Nov. 25. 
  Gorbunovs pointed to one major shortcoming in van der 
Stoel's 
proposal. The bulk of non-citizens came to Latvia by 1977 what 
may lead to mass-scale naturalization if the country introduces 
a 20-year residence threshold, for example, in 1996. 
  The speaker told van der Stoel that the new version could 
only be considered if the problem of repatriation of 
non-citizens was tackled simultaneously. 
  Gorbunovs suggested that the CSCE structures could be 
helpful 
in drafting a repatriation program, just like they are helpful 
in settling the citizenship issue. 
  The Saeima (parliament) would discuss the high 
commissioner's 
recommendations when discussing the citizenship bill. At the 
same time, Latvia waits for conclusions by international 
organizations to whom the citizenship bill was sent for expert 
study, Gorbunovs added.

Latvia and said he hoped Latvia and Russia would reach an accord 
soon. 
  The officials also discussed the process of adoption of 
Latvian citizenship law. The high commissioner advised to attach 
a greater priority to the knowledge of the Latvian language as a 
basic prerequisite for naturalization.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 7 Jan -- Max van der Stoel, CSCE high 
commissioner for national minorities, who has been studying the 
problems of citizenship in Latvia, ends his regular visit to 
this country today. 
  During his meetings he has been acquainted with the draft 
law 
on citizenship, which has already passed its first reading. The 
draft envisages that, depending on the demographic and economic 
situation, the [Latvian] Government will decide how many people 
are granted citizenship every year. 
  In the opinion of the CSCE commissioner, prospects for many 
citizens will remain vague. He suggests that one should be 
guided by the number of years people have lived in Latvia. 
  However, according to Saeima Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs, 
this approach will lead to a "large wave of naturalization." 
The parliament head said a repatriation program is needed, 
which would encourage people to leave voluntarily. In his 
opinion, the CSCE structures could demonstrate initiative by 
drawing up such a program. 
  During his visit Max van der Stoel was told that non-Latvian 
citizens intend setting up an association to protect the 
interests of more than 700,000 people. Representatives of the 
initiative group handed him a list of laws which restrict the 
rights of citizens with no citizenship, who amount to one-third 
of the population. They are deprived of the opportunity to work 
as lawyers and judges, to own land, to freely choose their place 
of residence in Latvia, and to go to some European countries 
without a visa. The bill on the elections to local authorities, 
which has passed two readings, does not allow them to elect and 
be elected. Sergejs Dimanis, leader of the "Equality" 
[Ravnopraviye] movement, commented on the bill in detail. 
  The Latvian Foreign Ministry press service reports that at 
the meeting with the head of the Foreign Political Department, 
the CSCE commissioner said he "can see no violations of human 
rights in Latvia."

  [Text] Riga, Jan 07, BNS -- Ethnic Latvians should ensure 
their national identity in their historic homeland but resident 
non-Latvians should also enjoy guarantees of peaceful life, Max 
Van der Stoel, the CSCE high commissioner on ethnic minorities, 
told the Baltic nation's President Guntis Ulmanis Friday. 
  The high commissioner made a conditioned division of the 
country's non-Latvians into those who really want to integrate 
into the Latvian society and those who do not, and would leave 
the country in next five years. He estimated the second group at 
10,000 persons. 
  If somebody who lived in Latvia for a longer time failed to 
learn the language, his willingness to integrate into the local 
society as a full-fledged citizen becomes doubtful, said Van der 
Stoel. 
  Van der Stoel, however, criticized the quota principle 
stipulated by the Latvian draft citizenship law. The doubts and 
uncertainty among non-citizens should disappear; they must have 
a clear picture of their future, he said. 
  Ulmanis answered that he could not think about the future 
not 
thinking about the future of Latvians who also did not have 
clear prospects in view of the threat of being pulled back to 
the sphere of Russia's interests. 
  Consequently, it is not enough to judge by the language 
skills on naturalization. The people brought to Latvia by force 
or lured in by sweet promises should be offered a chance to 
return home. But Latvia should receive some help to manage the 
complicated process, said Ulmanis.

  [Text] 140 Russian families, belonging to the resettling 
association "Roots" and wishing to return to Russia for 
permanent residence, have sent a letter to President Bill 
Clinton. 
  They note that attempts to secure credits from the 
governments of Latvia and Russia to build settlements in the 
Pskov region where construction sites have already been provided 
for repatriates have been deadlocked. 
  They tell Clinton that they would appreciate assistance from 
American businessmen to build a construction materials 
enterprise, a creamery and a meat packing plant in the area. 
  "We do not want to be a blind weapon in the hands of 
nationalists like Zhirinovskiy and his party, playing skillfully 
on our feelings," the message says. 
  As the Association's Chairman Vyacheslav Tikhomirov has 
reported to INTERFAX, about 5000 people are ready to leave 
Latvia for Russia. 
  According to the results of a poll made available earlier in 
the week to Max van der Stoel, the CSCE high commissionaire for 
ethnic minorities who visited Latvia last week, 160,000 people 
want to go to Russia and 190,000 to western countries from 
Latvia.

Kiev on 9 December: "Ukraine Will Be Independent and Strong"] 
  [Excerpts] The President Stakes His All on the Issue 
of Nuclear-Free Status and Makes a New Statement Through 
UKRAYINSKA HAZETA 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, thank you very much for finding 
time and responding to my request to meet with UKRAYINSKA HAZETA 
and discuss issues that are of particular concern for the 
Ukrainian people today. There is no doubt that these issues 
also concern you as president, the first president of 
independent Ukraine. Today, you, Mr. President, are bitterly 
assailed from all sides -- by National Democrats, Social 
Communists, and so-called Centrists. The common people also 
criticize you (and not without reason). They have become 
disillusioned by the present leadership and present government 
due to the catastrophically declining standard of living. Let 
us, Leonid Makarovych, speak openly. 
  [Kravchuk] Okay. 
  [Zholdak] UKRAYINSKA HAZETA also has and does criticize you, 
if you have read its publications. 
  [Kravchuk] I have. I follow your newspaper's activity. I 
like it. 
  [Zholdak] This is probably why you agreed to hold this 
meeting, because our attacks on you do not involve insults or 
pinning on labels. Our columnists, among whom, as you know, 
there is one of the most authoritative, decent, and integral 
Ukrainian figures -- Ihor Yukhnovskyy.... 
  [Kravchuk] Yes. 
  [Zholdak] Our columnists assess what you are doing for 
Ukraine's good and where you are failing.... 
  [Kravchuk] You have a subjective view of things. 
  [Zholdak] No, Leonid Makarovych, we have an independent 
point of view. We are not inclined to support a single party or 
a single political force and, of course, we do not support the 
opposition for that matter. Our position is as follows: Assist 
the president, Supreme Council, government, and leaders of 
institutions in their best deeds and be objective in assessing 
their mistakes, failures, or even anti-Ukrainian actions. 
UKRAYINSKA HAZETA only depends upon one thing -- Ukraine, its 
independence, and the prosperity and well- being of the 
Ukrainian people. All of our publications focus on two topics: 
Who are we? Who leads us? 
  [Kravchuk] I share your aspirations. 
  [Zholdak] In order to keep this conversation to the point 
and make it as frank as possible, I will tell you about my 
attitude toward you, Leonid Makarovych. I have mixed feelings. 
I feel primarily, gratitude. If you remember the year 1988 
when the Kiev Ivan Franko Theater was preparing the performance 
"Moment," the first in Ukraine based upon the works by the 
"bourgeois" and, not very long ago, also nationalist, prominent 
writer Volodymyr Vynnychenko. At that time you, as head of the 
ideological department at Ukraine's Communist Party Central 
Committee, were the only one to rescue the first show. 
  [Passage omitted on cultural issues] 
  [Zholdak] Let us start with what is particularly important 
for the fate of Ukrainian independence -- its national security. 
The preceding issue of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA, if you read it, 
carried an interview with Yuriy Kostenko, head of the working 
deputies' group on preparing for the ratification of START I and 
Ukraine's nuclear-free status. Yuriy Kostenko is Ukraine's 
people's deputy and Ukraine's minister of environmental 
protection. 
  [Kravchuk] I read it thoroughly. 
  [Zholdak] In particular, it expresses disagreement, Mr. 
President, with your position regarding the immediate transfer 
of all the nuclear weapons to Russia. 
  [Kravchuk] My position on this point is final and 
invariable. 
  [Zholdak] In our interview with Kostenko, we quoted your 
letter to U.S. President George Bush of 7 May 1992 in which you 
informed the American president that you were trying to urgently 
transfer to Russia all the nuclear weapons from Ukraine -- 
tactical in 1992 and strategic -- by 1994. Did you make such a 
commitment? 
  [Kravchuk] In that letter nobody made such a commitment. 
The entire letter should have been read. I wrote something 
else. I wrote that Ukraine would do what is envisaged by START 
and by the Statement on Ukraine's Nuclear-Free Statement, which 
was adopted by our Supreme Council. 
  [Zholdak] Why are you in such a hurry to transfer everything 
at one go? Russia has not paid us a cent for the tactical 
weapons that have already been transferred there. 
  [Kravchuk] The point is that even now I believe that we must 
transfer our nuclear weapons as soon as possible. However, of 
course, you are right, we must get compensation for our expenses. 
  [Zholdak] They [Russia] will not give compensation for 
anything! 
  [Kravchuk] Why not? We have already reached an agreement 
with Russia on strategic weapons. We have signed an agreement. 
  [Zholdak] However, that agreement applies to strategic 
weapons. We have received nothing for tactical ones. In the 
opinion of our and foreign specialists, they are worth billions 
of U.S. dollars. 
  [Kravchuk] Negotiations are now under way on the tactical 
weapons as well. There is an agreement in principle on 
compensation for those weapons, too. 
  [Zholdak] Cannot you, like Russia, also put pressure upon 
them and fight for our good? 
  [Kravchuk] We are fighting within the limits of our 
possibilities and law. However, you see, the oil- and gas tap 
is on the other side. So far, we are deeply in debt. Generally 
speaking, putting pressure means a policy from a position of 
strength. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you received the belated 
telegram from Yeltsin regarding the ratification of START I by 
Ukraine. 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, I did. 
  [Zholdak] Our press wrote much about it. One newspaper even 
quoted the telegram and asserted that Mr. Yeltsin humiliated you 
and set an ultimatum to the effect that all the strategic 
weapons be transferred to Russia within two years. Can you read 
this telegram to me or give it to me to publish in UKRAYINSKA 
HAZETA? Or is it a secret? 
  [Kravchuk] No, there is nothing secret about it. However, 
it is a personal letter. Why make it public? It is not for 
publishing. 
  [Zholdak] However, the Ukrainian people must know that the 
Ukrainian president is bound hand and foot. Here, I take your 
side and do not want you to be humiliated. 
  [Kravchuk] Nobody is bound. Let us analyze the situation 
soberly. Yeltsin's letter deals with two aspects. 
  [Zholdak] Is it a letter or a telegram? 
  [Kravchuk] A letter telegram. It was meant as a telegram, 
but arrived as a letter. 
  [Zholdak] Excuse me, Leonid Makarovych, how does this letter 
telegram start? Esteemed Comrade President? Highly esteemed 
Mr. President? 
  [Kravchuk] What difference does it make? 
  [Zholdak] It is very interesting. 
  [Kravchuk] He writes: "Dear Leonid Makarovich." 
  [Zholdak] Oh, this is good! 
  [Kravchuk] No, this does not mean that this word determines 
the policy. 
  [Zholdak] Well, there are two aspects in the letter. 
  [Kravchuk] Two aspects. First. He analyzes the situation 
that has taken shape after the ratification of START I by the 
Supreme Council and thinks that this cannot be considered as a 
ratification. 
  [Zholdak] Whose situation does he analyze? The one that has 
taken shape in Ukraine or in Russia? 
  [Kravchuk] In the world. 
  [Zholdak] Why does he consider our parliament's decision 
wrong? 
  [Kravchuk] Because it deviates from the promises that were 
previously made by Ukraine's Supreme Council and by Ukraine in 
signing the Lisbon Protocol. It is true. We did deviate from 
our promises. Here, we must call a spade a spade. It was not 
my decision to deviate. I insist that we must be consistent. 
In my opinion, the Supreme Council did things that I consider 
to be short-sighted for Ukraine. Our state's international 
prestige has been seriously undermined. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, the Lisbon Protocol was not 
signed by you as president and head of our state responsible for 
Ukraine's well-being, but by Mr. Zlenko, the country's minister 
of foreign affairs. 
  [Kravchuk] This does not matter, because we are dealing with 
a certain status of the document. 
  [Zholdak] How come it does not matter? Why, in that case, 
is there any need for the Supreme Council's decision? It must 
ratify or refuse to ratify that protocol. This is world 
practice. I believe that the minister's signature is legally 
not valid. The Supreme Council has the right to either ratify 
or not ratify, to do either one or the other. 
  [Kravchuk] The right must be used in the interests of the 
state. 
  [Zholdak] Was it not ratified in the interests of the state, 
with demands that we must receive compensation for different 
things? That we must get international security guarantees? Was 
that a bad thing to do, Mr. President? 
  [Kravchuk] Am I saying anything against it? However, it was 
also necessary to ratify the NNT. 
  [Zholdak] The what? 
  [Kravchuk] NNT -- that we join the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
  [Zholdak] Is this the fifth item? 
  [Kravchuk] Yes. I am not saying that the Supreme Council 
was wrong to make those reservations. However, it depends on 
which of them. I agree with some of them, while others are 
fundamentally at variance with our previously determined 
position. 
  [Zholdak] However, if we had endorsed that fifth item of the 
Lisbon Protocol, we would have agreed juridically that we did 
not possess nuclear weapons, and then we would have been 
rejected like worn-out horses. 
  [Kravchuk] How do you mean we do not possess nuclear 
weapons? 
  [Zholdak] This is what is written there. 
  [Kravchuk] It is written there that we do not spread nuclear 
weapons. 
  [Zholdak] If we sign it, Russia will get the right to remove 
anything it wants from our territory. Knowledgeable specialists 
told me about this. 
  [Kravchuk] That is what they are saying. You had better 
listen to what I tell you. 
  [Zholdak] Yes. 
  [Kravchuk] Has Russia joined the protocol? 
  [Zholdak] It has. 
  [Kravchuk] It has joined the protocol. Have Belarus and 
Kazakhstan joined it? Yes, they have. All states have joined, 
and Ukraine has not done so. Why? How will you explain this to 
people? That you are in favor of the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons? Tell me how you are going to spread them. Or explain 
to me that nonsense one hears from the lips of both 
ultra-left-wing and ultra-right-wing chatterboxes to the effect 
that we can change the codes of our warheads. I want to ask you 
my first and main question. These are not abstract notions. Do 
you want to retarget them against the United States, or Russia, 
or France? There is no such thing as abstract coding. The 
missiles are presently targeted against the United States. 
  [Zholdak] Yes. 
  [Kravchuk] However, the button is in Russia. Do you 
understand? 
  [Zholdak] Yes. 
  [Kravchuk] This means that, today, I, as president, have 
nuclear weapons, but I do not control them. 
  [Zholdak] We have them as a dangerous tenant? 
  [Kravchuk] For me, they only constitute danger. I know that 
the button is "there." That is why I am saying: Why don't we 
deactivate these weapons, and demand compensation for them, and 
give them away? We will never use them. Everybody must realize 
this. 
  [Zholdak] At the same time, Mrs. Thatcher said that this is 
protection and that this is deterrence against attacks. 
  [Kravchuk] In what way? 
  [Zholdak] If we have these formidable weapons, we will not 
be attacked. 
  [Kravchuk] But I told her. Suppose, you have a stick. 
  [Zholdak] Yes. 
  [Kravchuk] A cue. It is yours. At present, a person who 
sits there in the reception room holds it. Tell me, will you be 
able to use it? 
  [Zholdak] No. 
  [Kravchuk] Then why prattle, excuse me for the word? I have 
missiles that I cannot use. 
  [Zholdak] What can we do to make them usable for us? 
  [Kravchuk] It is un-re-a-lis-tic! [hyphens as published]. 
  [Zholdak] That is why you did not want the Supreme Council's 
decision not [as published] to specify 36 and 42 percent of the 
initial reduction of nuclear weapons? 
  [Kravchuk] This is all nonsense, because when the service 
life of the warheads expires, we will transfer them irrespective 
of decrees or edicts. Nobody will allow a tragedy to happen. 
When I gathered all scientists that could be found in this 
sphere and we discussed this question twice at the Security 
Council, the scientists proved in detail that it is the 
manufacturer alone who can change anything. We in Ukraine do 
not manufacture the warheads. Russia does. The manufacturing 
plant installs a code and nobody else in the world knows it. 
  [Zholdak] I see. 
  [Kravchuk] We can remove the warhead and put it aside "for 
storage." 
  [Zholdak] And launch.... 
  [Kravchuk] Never. A missile may be launched, but there will 
be no nuclear explosion. Because this is encoded and the codes 
are in Moscow. Well, this is common knowledge. Moreover, every 
part has its own service life. The fact that the Supreme 
Council did not ratify.... I reiterate, suppose that tomorrow 
the period of safe physical life of a missile expires.... They 
may refuse to ratify, I do not care. I will remove these 
warheads! I am making this statement through UKRAYINSKA HAZETA. 
Because, tomorrow, it may be too late and, tomorrow, something 
irreparable may happen. It will not be your responsibility 
and not the responsibility of the Supreme Council as a 
legislative organ, but of the president who allowed this to 
happen. 
  [Zholdak] You have made very strong statements, Leonid 
Makarovych.... I am already inclined to believe that this is 
what should be done.... 
  [Kravchuk] I am telling you how things really are. By 
comparison with what may happen in connection with the nuclear 
weapons, Chernobyl was child's play. I do not want to 
intimidate anybody. We have 176 missiles, and every warhead is 
such a terrible force that is hard to imagine. 
  [Zholdak] As you are saying, one of them may explode on its 
own if its "death" comes? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, we will not allow this to happen, because 
we will ensure technological supervision. However, there are 
time limits beyond which the warheads acquire a difficult state. 
Then I will turn to Russia: "Take them away!" To this, 
specialists may say: "We will not go there. It is already 
dangerous." That's it! Do anything you want with them. Then 
you will give them away and beg to have them taken, but they 
will not be taken. 
  [Zholdak] I see. 
  [Kravchuk) These are such complicated things, and should not 
be resolved through emotions or in an unprofessional manner. 
One can declare with pride: "We have nuclear weapons, and we 
are strong!" Those who say so realize that, today, Ukraine 
cannot use its nuclear weapons. 
  [Zholdak] It appears then that it is pointless to hope that 
we may leave at least one missile to intimidate somebody? 
  [Kravchuk] Absolutely! There is, however, one thing, if we 
approach this problem realistically. We can see how we can use 
the launchers for peaceful purposes. I reiterate that nuclear 
weapons cannot be used by our country. We are driving ourselves 
into a deadlock. Why? I will tell you. Every nuclear state 
manufactures its own nuclear weapons. 
  [Zholdak] We cannot manufacture them on our own? 
  [Kravchuk] No, we cannot, because we do not have a nuclear 
industry. In order to create a nuclear industry, we need many 
years and tens of billions of karbovantsi. 
  [Zholdak] In order to manufacture them and to build a plant? 
  [Kravchuk] A plant. 
  [Zholdak] Tens of billions.... This.... This is, so far, 
unrealistic for us.... 
  [Kravchuk] This may be achieved in 15 years. 
  [Zholdak] We will have this much money? 
  [Kravchuk] No, if this question arises and the entire 
economy is aimed at this, as well as the resources and the 
people's efforts.... And if there is also money, then we could 
handle this.... The enrichment of uranium.... Control.... In 
that case, the state does everything on its own. Nobody sells 
nuclear weapons to anybody. It is not a rifle. A state that 
proclaims itself as nuclear, must have the entire nuclear cycle. 
By its decree, the Supreme Council has, in fact, proclaimed 
Ukraine's nuclear status. On what grounds? We are not a nuclear 
power. We only have the nuclear weapons that we have inherited. 
The world and Yeltsin are saying: Once you have proclaimed 
yourselves as a nuclear power, take upon yourselves all the 
relevant responsibilities. Can you service your nuclear 
weapons? No. Can you create them? No. Do you have 
technological provision or spare parts? No. What do you want 
then? What can I say to that? Nothing. 
  [Zholdak] Is this what Yeltsin wrote to you? 
  [Kravchuk] Not in these words, but this is the meaning. 
Another thing. He wrote about the consequences of all of this 
for Russia. If you are a nuclear power, then why should we 
service your nuclear complexes? You must do that on your own. 
What do we need all those intricacies for? You have not joined 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, whereas Russia has. By 
helping you, we will be in violation of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. For my part, I am telling him: We 
want compensation. For us, this is the main issue. So that 
there is no recurrence of our transferring our weapons for free. 
After all, it is the people's work. Both tactical and 
strategic weapons cost something. Let us resolve these issues: 
One -- compensation, and the other -- security for our 
statehood.... 
  [Zholdak] They will agree and then deceive us. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, if we proceed from this, then not a single 
document can be signed. This is not serious. The third 
condition is financial and technological assistance. Three 
aspects. Shall we resolve them? Then we will proceed further, 
and the Supreme Council will return to this question. I am sure 
of it. 
  [Zholdak] Did you say that to him? 
  [Kravchuk) To him and to Clinton. 
  [Zholdak] You have already answered his [Yeltsin's] letter? 
  [Kravchuk] Of course. I wrote and also said this in a 
conversation. 
  [Zholdak] What kind of letter was that of Yeltsin's? 
Benevolent? Without any ultimatums? 
  [Kravchuk] There were no ultimatums. He reasons what and 
how could be done. That he is concerned. That the world may 
look upon Ukraine as a state that may be blamed for halting 
nuclear disarmament. You know what they say and write abroad: 
You have not joined the treaty, you have, in fact, failed to 
ratify the treaty, and, therefore, you stand in the way of total 
nuclear disarmament. START I is followed by START II. If 
historians start analyzing, believe me, we will be accused of 
causing political and military tension on our planet. You will 
not be able to prove anything to hi-sto-ry. 
  [Zholdak] It is, however, suspicious that America is so keen 
on our disarmament. It does not disarm itself and, while being, 
perhaps, the strongest nuclear power, it puts pressure upon us 
not to allow us to be a nuclear power. Even though we are now 
economically weak, our military armor and guns are powerful. 
That is why they [the Americans] are preoccupied with us like 
big dogs with a nice little cat. The cat has sharp claws. If 
these claws are cut off, we will do what they want us to do or 
else we will be punished. We also want to be a strong state. 
We deserve it. 
  [Kravchuk] There is also much I would like to have. 
However, we must think soberly. The missiles deployed in 
Ukraine are targeted against America. 
  [Zholdak] That is so. 
  [Kravchuk] They know that the button is in Moscow. There is 
economic chaos both here and there. There is also political 
chaos. The Americans fear that this chaos may be dangerous for 
the world and for peace. It may occur to somebody.... When 
there is stability, order, discipline, and scientific 
supervision, it is a different matter. They are afraid. I 
understand them. I told Clinton that we are ready to deactivate 
our warheads and leave them in Ukraine. Not to transfer, but to 
store them here. 
  [Zholdak] Will they be safer then? 
  [Kravchuk] To begin with, safer, and I will know that the 
button will not be used by somebody somewhere to launch these 
missiles from the territory of Ukraine. I am responsible before 
the world. These are ideas and assumptions. We will do 
everything to prevent this from ever happening, but we must take 
into account other countries' fears. 
  [Zholdak] This is not bad. We can arrive at such a 
decision: Either you or the Supreme Council? 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, we can! However, we want some steps to be 
made toward us. We want other countries to trust us, and I will 
do everything I can to achieve this trust and get some normal 
assistance without humiliating conditions, an economic 
assistance and normal attitude not only because we possess 
nuclear weapons. We must see to it that Ukraine is looked upon 
as a country with high culture, science, and a large economic 
potential, which may be put into effect. To make first steps. 
We will make them, too. We will start working in a civilized 
manner and with respect for one another. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, they [the Americans] do not 
really want to help us. They promise us $175 million. 
According to estimates made by specialists, up to 2 billion is 
necessary for disarmament. Nobody will give us that much money. 
Our state treasury is empty. What difference will it make if 
the Supreme Council does adopt a decision, which you, Yeltsin, 
Clinton, and the whole world expect? 
  [Kravchuk] After adopting such a decision, we could raise 
the question of money. We want it like in [Ilf and Petrov's] 
"Twelve Chairs" [on a blue-bordered plate -- without any effort 
on our part]. I already said this at the Supreme Council 
session: If chairs are handed over in the morning, then money 
must be paid [the previous] evening, or, if the chairs are 
handed over in the evening, then money is received [the 
previous] morning, but money first. 
  [Zholdak] Did you speak to Clinton here, from your office? 
  [Kravchuk] This is the telephone through which I spoke to 
Clinton. 
  [Zholdak] How did he talk to you? Politely or as a dictator? 
  [Editorial note] To be continued in the next issue.

  [Text] Kiev, Jan 11 (AFP) -- Ukraine on Tuesday cast doubt 
on whether it will sign a definitive agreement to dismantle its 
nuclear arsenal on Friday, as announced by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton in Brussels. 
  "Despite Bill Clinton's declarations in Brussels, the 
Ukrainian side is not sure that the definitive version of the 
accord on the fate of its nuclear weapons will be signed in 
Moscow on January 14," Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuriy Sergeyev 
said. 
  "If by that date the definitive version has not been worked 
out, realised, the three-way summit (between Clinton, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk) in 
Moscow will be purely consultative," Sergeyev told reporters.

"Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Speaking on Ukrainian television, Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko stated that the inability to find the necessary 
ways of solving imminent problems of Ukrainian-Russian relations 
"does no credit to either Ukraine or Russia." However, 
according to Zlenko, Russia for Ukraine is a special strategic 
partner, and therefore the result of bilateral talks "always 
determines the desire to find ways to settle differences that 
crop up." Anatoliy Zlenko also stated that he values highly the 
efficiency of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev while 
always openly criticizing him for inconsistency. Characterizing 
his relations with the current Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, Zlenko 
stated that they are businesslike because the deputies had 
passed a number of documents elaborated by the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in particular the guidelines of 
Ukraine's foreign policy. Zlenko expressed the wish that a 
future parliament of Ukraine would consist of professionals, 
honest people who would not so often revile Ukraine, a country 
which they intend to serve. The foreign minister listed among 
Ukraine's accomplishments last year the establishment of the 
first stage of foreign policy, the creation of the basis for 
expanding relations between states, the establishment of an 
embassy and consulate infrastructure abroad, and the acquiring 
by his agency of new premises and new diplomatic cadres. 
Anatoliy Zlenko pointed out as the main event of last year the 
fact that the Ukrainian people "showed patience, wisdom, and 
good sense, and we have come to the New Year in peace and 
accord."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Zlenko by an unidentified </F>
reporter at the Foreign Ministry; date not given; from "Without 
a Protocol" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] What, in your opinion, were the 
most dramatic events in the sphere of foreign policy in 1993? 
Were they the Massandra agreements, the START-I ratification 
with all its provisos, the adoption of Ukrainian foreign policy 
directions, or some aspects of negotiations? 
  [Zlenko] I want to start by pointing out that Ukraine has 
been acknowledged by 145 nations of the world, and 132 have 
initiated diplomatic relations with us. This is very pleasant. 
This is a factor of great significance for the development of 
our state. With regard to dramatic events, all the issues that 
you mentioned had influenced the work of the Foreign Ministry 
in some way, as well as the life of the state in general. 
However, speaking of the most relevant problems that may impact 
on the future, I think these were nuclear issues, in particular, 
the discussion and ratification of START and the Lisbon 
Protocol. I would like to underline that right at this moment, 
when we are holding this interview, Ukraine is not in isolation. 
It enjoys normal relations with different nations of the world 
and this, too, gives me grounds to say that we will soon find a 
resolution for this difficult problem. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Andrey Kozyrev is another representative of a new 
generation of diplomats. You probably worked with his 
predecessors. Interesting situations something occur when this 
man says different things about Ukraine. 
  [Zlenko] I pay attention to this, and I openly criticize 
Andrey Kozyrev in his and my retinue's presence. I openly speak 
out at forums trying to rebut [his statements] to a maximum 
extent. This, in particular, happened both in Brussels and Rome. 
Speaking of who is victorious in such disputes.... We have 
special relations with Russia; we are trying to treat Russia as 
a special partner. Of course, a large number of unresolved, 
complicated problems has piled up. We are trying to find ways 
to resolve them which determines the nature of our negotiations. 
One cannot say that these issues have been unresolved because 
Ukraine did not try hard or because the Russian side outwitted 
us. I think that the very fact that these problems still exist 
does no credit to either Ukraine or Russia. 
  [Reporter] What are your relations with the current 
legislature? One sometimes gets the impression that the Supreme 
Council treats the Foreign Ministry as an office issuing 
documents for lawmakers' foreign trips. 
  [Zlenko] I want to point out that in general, my relations 
with the current legislature are good. A lot of legislative 
acts drafted by the Foreign Ministry were approved by the 
Supreme Council. There were difficulties in lobbying the 
foreign policy concept but lawmakers finally passed it. I think 
that the majority of deputies have an understanding of today's 
foreign policy and the activities of the Foreign Ministry. Of 
course, there have been conflicts with some of the deputies, 
even overt attacks on me. But I have never descended to their 
level and held debates with them. I would like the next Supreme 
Council to be professional and manned with patriots of Ukraine 
with an understanding of the problems of foreign policy. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] What was your and your team's main accomplishment 
in 1993 on the international arena? 
  [Zlenko] I think that the first matter worth mentioning is 
the completion of the first stage of determining Ukraine's 
foreign policy. Second, we have managed to create the basis for 
developing international relations. Third, we have formed a 
diplomatic and consular infrastructure abroad. Finally, it is 
the very fact that we are now sitting in this new building with 
new people arriving. The process of expanding the Foreign 
Ministry is under way. However, the main issue for me is that 
during the difficult year of 1993 our people displayed courage, 
patience, and wisdom and that we have ended the year in peace 
and accord. There were no ethnic conflicts. Perhaps, the 
living standards have deteriorated but we have not stooped to 
grabbing arms to resolve ethnic or other problems. I believe 
that this was our main accomplishment in 1993.

<F P=106> [Report by Volodymyr Chikalin: "Nobody Can Prohibit Loving </F>
Ukraine"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported, the fifth congress of 
the Ukrainian Officers' Union [SOU] has taken place. Some 
observers predicted it could be the last congress, however, 
similar forecasts were voiced prior to all the previous 
congresses. As Mykola Rerikh once said: "The loftier the idea, 
the more dogs bark at it." 
  The fifth congress, unlike previous ones, was held in an 
everyday atmosphere which is understood, because the Army, like 
the rest of society is living through hard times. When times 
get hard, people concentrate on the most acute problems. 
  The Ministry of Defense leadership did not attend the 
conference, which demonstrated its attitude toward the SOU. On 
the eve of the congress, the ministry discussed whether 
delegates should be permitted to arrive in Kiev. However, some 
commanders had concealed the cable with the permission to hold 
the congress and a group of deputies failed to show up. Those 
who arrived said: "Banning the SOU is like banning love for 
Ukraine." When I was listening to their speeches, I became more 
and more assured that the strengthening of the national Armed 
Forces had become the primary goal in these people's lives. 
  The union is currently being blamed for involvement in 
political activities. However, is it not politics to implement 
the national policy of safeguarding Ukraine's security? Or why 
not grant officers a right to express their opinions regarding 
reform in the Army? Yet, the military command believes that 
every serviceman can only express opinions regarding his post. 
Thus, a squad commander can only speak on behalf of his squad 
and not meddle in the company's affairs. Those officers 
refusing to live in accordance with the 
cobbler-should-stick-to-his-last principle are risking the lose 
of their posts and ranks. This information was made public at 
the congress -- Colonel Serhiy Dudko was relieved of duty for 
sending a report on embezzlements of military property to a 
local newspaper. Even generals are being persecuted for 
"dissidence." Not long ago, General Major Oleksandr Rol, deputy 
chief of staff of the Ukrainian Air Force, expressed his 
viewpoint on reform of the Air Force speaking to a VECHIRNIY 
KYYIV correspondent. For this, he fell into the Staff's and 
Council of Ministers' disgrace. Persecution of "dissidents" is 
under way at all levels. 
  I met a former colleague of mine who is now a military 
reporter, and he said: "When I visit a military unit and people 
learn that I am a reporter, they run away from me." 
  Not all the officers put up with this kind of mentality 
prohibiting independent thinking. Speaking at the congress, SOU 
Deputy Chief Hryhoriy Omelchenko said: "We must leave this 
conference hall having relieved ourselves from our slave 
mentality. Without this, one cannot be a genuine patriot." 
  The congress demonstrated that not all the members of the 
union withstood the test. Some people backed out after 
abandoning hope of resolving social problems, others simply got 
scared in the face of reactionary command's attack. There was 
not a single regiment, battalion, or similar level commander 
among the delegates. Delivering a revision committee's report, 
Volodymyr Tymofeyev pointed out that the number of retired 
officers in the union is twice as large as that of active ones. 
Retired officers are even chairmen of some oblast 
organizations. When the union was being formed that situation 
was easy to account for -- people had nothing to lose. However, 
when the union was registered and entered the history of the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces as one of the most active forces 
supporting their development, a decrease in the number of union 
members gives ground for thought. I have already named some of 
the causes of the situation, but some demand separate 
consideration. Among SOU members, 85 percent are represented by 
Ukrainians, while the number of Ukrainians in the Armed Forces 
is much smaller. This is why delegates discussed the issue of 
reviewing personnel policy. Colonel Tsymbalyuk and Captain 
Second Rank Khryshchuk emphasized that the command is trying to 
ban SOU representatives from working in certification 
committees. The same opinions were voiced in the speech by Rukh 
Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil, who added that without reforming 
personnel policy we cannot build a national army capable of 
guaranteeing Ukraine's independence. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Volodymyr Mulyava also spoke on 
working under new conditions. He called upon delegates to 
expand SOU's influence in all spheres of Army life. In his 
opinion, in the future the union should be transformed into a 
general association of officers and noncommissioned officers. 
  The words "concrete measures" were not used at the first 
four 
congresses, because at that time, a program was being drafted. 
Not abandoning this line, the fifth congress paid more 
attention to resolving current problems, in particular, the 
union members' image as a model in combat training and social 
activities. Colonel Tretetskyy, chief of a unit's psychological 
service, said in this respect: "We used to have 17 officers in 
our organization; only 12 are left today, but they are real 
fighters for the cause of building Ukraine's Armed Forces. We 
are determined to serve as a model for others to follow. This 
opinion found its reflection in the resolution of the congress. 
  Today, when our Army is experiencing hard times, officers' 
personal examples play a very significant role. Here are a 
couple of examples demonstrating how difficult it is for the 
military to perform their functions. The Army receives only 33 
percent of necessary financing and even lacks money to pay 
servicemen's wages in timely fashion. Thus, it is no wonder 
that the Defense Ministry has recently bought only one T-80 tank 
produced in Kharkov. Shortages of fuel and spare parts have had 
a negative impact on training of airmen and led to the 
resignation of 170 young pilots. However, it takes a lot of 
determination to unselfishly serve the motherland in these 
conditions. The fact that the union appealed for personal 
examples means that the organization will see better times. The 
more difficult the situation in the Army, the higher its rating 
among the people. Today, 62.5 percent of Ukrainians have 
confidence in the officers' corps, while among farmers this 
figure reaches 83 percent. The people rely on its defenders for 
the protection of their most cherished values--freedom and 
independence. This gives the Army strength and inspiration.

  [Text] Chairman of the Belarusian parliament Stanislav 
Shushkevich put off his visit to Moscow until January 12. He 
had earlier agreed with Russian President Boris Yeltsin that the 
visit would take place on January 11. 
  Valeriy Tsepkalo, an adviser of the head of parliament, told 
INTERFAX that Shushkevich needed more time to analyze the 
results of the Moscow visit by a Belarusian government team 
headed by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. 
  Shushkevich will go to Moscow by train, which will leave 
Minsk late on January 11 and arrive in Moscow early next morning. 
  Vasily Vorobyov, Shushkevich's press secretary, told 
INTERFAX 
that Shushkevich would meet with Yeltsin alone behind closed 
doors in the Kremlin on January 12. 
  Shushkevich will leave for Minsk on the same day and give a 
news conference there on January 13 about the results of his 
meeting with the Russian president.

<F P=106> [Report by Valer Kalinowski: "Shushkevich on Clinton's Visit </F>
to Belarus] 
  [Text] [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich has 
described the upcoming 16 January official visit by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton as an important and positive event for 
Belarus. Currently, special committees are preparing and 
drafting special interstate agreements. Stanislav Shushkevich 
emphasized that an array of important agreements is to be signed 
during the visit. In his opinion, the main goal of the visit is 
to clarify positions on the main strategic objectives of our 
policy and, in particular, the issue of Belarus' security. We 
would like to obtain guarantees for the protection of our 
neutrality -- such as Finland once received from the United 
States and the USSR -- when Belarus implements its 
constitutional law on neutrality and nonnuclear status, stressed 
Stanislav Shushkevich. Additionally, the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet chairman noted that he does not expect that such a 
statement can be voiced by the United States already on 16 
January, however certain steps will undoubtedly be made. 
  Commenting on Bill Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" 
initiative, Stanislav Shushkevich stated that he considers it 
expedient to examine Belarus' official strategy in establishing 
in Central Europe a belt of neutral states with certain 
guarantees from great states of the world. 
  Additionally, Stanislav Shushkevich believes that Bill 
Clinton's visit to Minsk will contribute to Belarus' 
international image and encourage U.S. investment in its economy.

  [Text] As BELAPAN has learned, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
will pay a visit to Belarus on 16 January 1994. During the 
visit, Belarusian and U.S. officials are expected to specify 
their positions on the issue of security guarantees for Belarus, 
which has implemented its constitutional law to become a neutral 
and nonnuclear state. Although it is unlikely that such 
guarantees will be announced on 16 January, in a conversation 
with BELAPAN, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich 
said that he will present, within the framework of Bill 
Clinton's Partnership for Peace initiative, Belarus' strategy 
for establishing a belt of neutral countries in Central Europe. 
  Problems connected with the protection of U.S. investments 
in 
Belarus will also be discussed during the negotiations.

  [Text] In an exclusive interview with a BELINFORM 
correspondent, Belarus Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislaw 
Shushkevich confirmed news agency reports that he is to meet 
with Boris Yeltsin. The sides intend in the very near future to 
make adjustments to their positions before U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's coming visit to Moscow and Minsk, and also to discuss 
the major problems of Belarusian-Russian relations. 
  Stanislaw Shushkevich said the state of our economy is 
critical. Moreover, I do not support suggestions that joining a 
single ruble zone will solve all our problems. [Words 
indistinct] sick and must be cured. We ourselves must find ways 
of restoring our economy on market relations. If that does not 
happen, the republic will be threatened with a terrible collapse. 
  Speaking about Bill Clinton's coming visit to Minsk, 
Shushkevich noted that if we solve theoretically such problems 
as disarmament, conversion, and monetary questions, then signing 
the corresponding agreements after that will be essentially just 
a technicality. So it is hardly likely that many specific 
documents will be signed in Minsk. That will have to be done in 
the future. 
  Stanislaw Shushkevich's statement also dealt with the 
INTERFAX report quoting Vyachaslaw Kebich as saying that after 
Russia joins NATO, Belarus may also become a member of that 
bloc. The point is, the speaker explained, that all Belarus's 
most important documents, including the constitutional law, 
indicate that Belarus adheres to a path of neutrality and of not 
adhering to any blocs. We have a completely different foreign 
policy doctrine, at whose center lies neutrality. Belarus never 
officially declared its desire to enter the North Atlantic 
union. This statement is no way connected with the CIS 
countries' collective security treaty, which Vyachaslaw 
Frantsavich [Kebich] has always supported. Perhaps this is some 
sort of mistake by journalists, Stanislaw Shushkevich concluded.

<F P=106> [Statement by Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich </F>
in Minsk on 31 December: "On Unification of Belarusian and 
Russian Monetary Systems" -- first paragraph is ZVYAZDA 
introduction] 
  [Text] On the eve of the new year, Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet Chairman S. Shushkevich met with the staff of our 
newspaper and answered numerous questions. Mr. Shuskevich 
concentrated on the issue of creating the ruble zone. What is 
his assessment of this move by the Belarusian parliament? What 
implications will it have for Belarusian citizens? When should 
the unification be expected? Here is what Stanislav Shushkevich 
told journalists. 
  [Shushkevich] I abstained from voting on the issue of 
unification of the monetary systems because this is not the only 
way to solve this problem. Even when Russia, for political 
reasons, accepts the losses it would incur by the merger, our 
life will continue to depend on the way we manage our economy. 
No one is going to take care of us all the time. But what 
kinds of situations might this move create? For example, 
salaries may not be paid out because a Russian bank did not 
release the cash. (Incidentally, it would be a wise thing to do 
-- one should shrewdly conduct business.) Thus, all this can 
give rise to populist politicians who want to capitalize on this 
move. Let us see what advantages it will bring for the 
Belarusian economy? Take our tractor plant, for instance. 
Suppose the price for one tractor is about 1 million Russian 
rubles [R]. For this money, the plant can receive 4 million 
"hares" [nickname for Belarusian national currency] at the 
official exchange rate. The purchasing power of our currency, 
as far as foodstuffs are concerned, is almost the same as that 
of the Russian ruble. So what do we get? A rank-and-file 
worker gains by exchanging the "hare" for the ruble. However, 
it is like a shot out of the blue for the manager of the tractor 
plant. Now, with the plant's funds in Russia, he is able to 
settle there accounts for raw materials and components, while 
here he has to pay using the one-to-four exchange rate. 
  By the way, Fedorov and Gerashchenko no longer have anything 
against this idea. Only their deputies continue to press for 
the one-to-two rate. A political decision certainly depends on 
Russia's highest leadership. 
  I believe that different prices for energy sources is the 
key 
issue in our relations with Russia today. This undermines our 
economy. Experts estimate that energy consumption accounts for 
4 percent of the production cost of the world's best tractors. 
The figure for Belarusian tractors is almost twice as big. If 
this tendency continues, energy consumption might jump to 15 
percent this year. In this case, we will pay 40 ECU more for 
oil than Russia, greatly reducing the competitiveness of our 
products. This puts our economy at the edge of an abyss. 
  Among consequences that we could see from the merger of our 
currencies is the removal of all custom duties. However, one 
should be completely frank here. When the OPEC countries gather 
for their meetings, they do not decide what price they should 
sell oil to Germany or France. They set just one common price. 
Russia is a kind of OPEC for us. What happened? It set 
different prices for Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and 
Uzbekistan. Even though we behaved ourselves, we pay 40 ECU 
more for their oil than clients inside Russia. We should be 
outspoken about this if we consider ourselves honest 
politicians. What kind of political union it is supposed to be 
when it makes our economy a mess. I think it tightens the noose 
around our neck, which is in the interests of Russia. I believe 
that in this situation, Russia should make some concessions to 
us and cancel all customs payments. And when we manage to merge 
our monetary systems along decent and fair lines, I think a lot 
of government members, bank chairmen, and many other officials 
will lose their jobs. It is going to be a time for tough 
monetary policies, which many politicians are not able to accept 
because of their market-hostile mentality.

  [Text] Representatives of the opposition Belarusian 
Popular Front [BNF], Z. Paznyak, V. Golubev, and S. Naumchik 
have held a news conference at the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. 
In the words of S. Naumchik, "despite the resistance of certain 
circles," U.S. President Clinton will visit Kuropaty [burial 
site of thousands of victims murdered by Soviet security police 
in the 1930's] on 16 January and meet with BNF Chairman Z. 
Paznyak. "The initiative to meet came from the American side," 
Z. Paznyak specified. The parliamentary opposition leader also 
voiced harsh criticism of Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Shushkevich for signing the CIS Collective Security Treaty. He 
accused Shushkevich of betraying the national interests of 
Belarus. Speaking on the issue of unifying the Belarusian and 
Russian monetary systems, Z. Paznyak noted that Russia is 
"waging economic war against Belarus," and that the last 
agreement concluded by Yeltsin, Kebich, and Chernomyrdin means 
that "our country has surrendered." At the news conference, 
parliamentary opposition activists denounced Belarus' entry into 
NATO. "Only a policy of neutrality and the support of European 
states will help Belarus survive," Z. Paznyak emphasized. In 
addition, he said he doubted that the elections set for this 
spring will actually take place.

Belarus and the Russian Federation as to the unification of 
monetary systems of the two countries. The first one concerns 
currency exchange rates. Belarus insists that NBB's bills be 
exchanged for Russian rubles at the one to one rate. Russia 
demands that the rate be one Russian ruble to three Belarusian 
ones. Another controversy is that whereas Belarus demands that 
Russia's internal prices for energy sources be extended to 
Belarus, representatives of the Russian Government do not agree 
with this. The Russian Ministries of Finance and Economy 
present a particularly uncompromising position. Yet another 
meeting of Russian and Belarusian Government delegations is to 
be held in January, at which attempts to solve the problems are 
to be made. The visit last week to Moscow by a Belarusian 
delegation resulted, as is known, in signing another declaration 
on intentions to unify the monetary-credit systems of Belarus 
and Russia.

  [Text] Minsk, 10 Jan -- "Conversion -- employment -- 
entrepreneurship -- energy saving." The government of Belarus 
has embarked on creating a national program under this title. 
While it is being implemented, it will provide jobs for about 
7,000 military servicemen in the republic who are now living in 
military townlets which the Russian strategic troops are 
leaving. Soon former servicemen and the members of their 
families will be able to work in the sphere of small and 
medium-sized business. Representatives of entrepreneurial 
structures of the republic and the Minsk energy center of the 
European community have declared an interest in this. 
  The military townlets in the Polotsk, Gomel, Klimovichi, and 
Bykhov rayons will be the first to be reconstructed. The 
prospects for their transformation were discussed at an 
international seminar on conversion which ended in Minsk today. 
  The problem of creating new jobs for military servicemen was 
discussed with representatives of international labor 
organizations and business circles of Britain, Italy, the United 
States, and Switzerland. Representatives of the World Bank and 
the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development have said 
they are willing to take part in financing the program.

  According to Shirkovskiy, "the Oswald files are classified,

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM: "Europarliament Delegation in Belarus"] </F>
  [Text] A Europarliament delegation for cooperation with CIS 
states has arrived in Minsk. 
  Magdalene Phoff who headed this delegation said that the 
main 
aim of the visit is to get acquainted with the political and 
economic situation in the Republic and to widen the existing 
contacts between the Europarliament and Belarus. 
  On 4 January, Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, first deputy chairman of 
the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, received the members of the 
Europarliament delegation. During the talks, Magdalene Phoff 
said that the Europarliament will provide Belarus with specific 
aid. The Europarliament has already drafted a program for 
cooperation in the sphere of technology, and currently the 
implementation of this program is being studied. 
  Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, in his turn, spoke about the situation 
in the Republic. He said that 1994 will become a year of 
political activity for Belarusian citizens and a turning point 
for the development of the Belarusian economy. He stressed that 
the Supreme Soviet elections and the elections of a leader of 
Belarus will give an impulse to this process. The Supreme 
Soviet deputies are convinced that presidential elections should 
be carried out through nationwide elections. Further, 
Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, emphasized: "It is very important for us 
to hold presidential elections in the spring of 1994. A new 
president will form a new government; later, we could elect a 
new legislature." 
  The first deputy chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet 
spoke about the moves of the Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers and 
the Supreme Soviet aimed at the creation of an economic union 
and a ruble zone of a new type. This will enable us to upgrade 
cooperation among the CIS states and, particularly, to bolster 
economic cooperation. Speaking on the historic relations with 
Russia, Vyacheslav Kuznetsov emphasized that in the new 
political and economic situation the Supreme Soviet is striving 
to integrate the Belarusian economy into the world economic 
community. In connection with this, the lawmakers have adopted 
a range of laws regarding the foreign economic relations which, 
in the experts' opinion, correspond to existing international 
norms. 
  On the same day, Belarusian Foreign Minister Petr Kravchanka 
and CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya received the 
Europarliament delegation.

  [Text] Chisinau -- The election struggle in Moldova is 
gathering momentum. The usual methods are being employed to see 
who can inflict the worst bite. An official spokesman for the 
Moldovan president has issued a statement on the election 
campaign, in the course of which M. Snegur's is being bandied 
about in a variety of contexts and for a variety of reasons. 
Opposition political forces are accusing him, in particular, of 
not failing to give international publicity to the conflict in 
the Dniester region and of bringing about economic disaster in 
the republic. The president rejected all these charges as 
absurd and unsubstantiated. Snegur promised to issue a 
statement in the very near future "in response to irresponsible 
accusations by those who have turned patriotism into a trade" 
and to name those who are really to blame for the bloody 
conflict on the Dniester. Snegur once again peremptorily 
brushed aside suspicion of being involved in affairs connected 
with a branch of the Seabeco firm, which is headed by his 
son-in-law. Finally, he expressed confidence that the people 
will make their choice and thereby dot all the "i's."

<F P=106> [Correspondent Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] MOLDOVA PRESS has issued some information denying 
rumors according to which the sentence to death by shooting, 
pronounced in the case of Ilies Ilascu by the court of the self- 
proclaimed Dniester Republic was carried out yesterday, on 9 
January, after one month had passed since the respective 
sentence had been pronounced. The MOLDOVA PRESS correspondent 
contacted competent sources at the Presidency, Parliament, and 
Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Moldova, which 
categorically denied these rumors, calling them ill-favored and 
conniving in the current social-political context, their 
disseminators having other goals in mind than the ones directed 
by common sense and healthy reasoning. 
  According to MOLDOVA PRESS, Ilie Ilascu continues to be 
imprisoned in the Chlinaia-Grigoriopol Prison. As a matter of 
fact, in an interview granted exclusively to our radio station, 
Mr. Nicolae Andronic, president of the parliamentary 
subcommission in charge of solving the conflict in the eastern 
rayons of the Republic of Moldova made the following statement: 
  [Begin recording] [Andronic] What can happen because one 
month has passed? I do not know where the term one month comes 
from, but in the old legislation, which the Dniester Region is 
currently observing, it is not stipulated that the sentence 
should be carried out within one month or less than a month. 
The respective legislation stipulates that in two days the 
accused can still submit an appeal for a pardon. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Then why was the term of one month 
mentioned for submitting the pardon appeal in case of a sentence 
against which, the court stated, no appeal can be made. 
  [Andronic] Thus, again, the term one month was used more as 
a political than a legal term. A certain date was announced to 
ruffle spirits and set an ultimatum, maybe not a direct one, but 
an indirect one. However, I want to tell you that, currently, 
the date of 12 January is expected when the State Duma will 
start its proceedings in [word indistinct]. After Maracuta's 
[Grigore, president of Dniester Republic Parliament] latest 
visit there, he found people to support among those who [word 
indistinct] as a results of the elections in the Duma. This in 
order to receive something from Moscow. [end recording] 
  [Dascaliuc] This was the statement made to our correspondent 
in Chisinau, by Nicolae Andronic, president of the parliamentary 
subcommission in charge of solving the conflict in the eastern 
rayons of the Republic of Moldova.

  [Text] Ashgabat January 10 TASS -- The Council of Border 
Troop Commanders of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
opened its meeting in Ashgabat, the capital of the Turkmen 
Republic, on Monday [10 Janaury]. The commanders will discuss 
illegal migration and drug trafficking across outside borders of 
the commonwealth states. 
  They will also examine principles of cooperation in logistic 
supplies to border troops. The meeting will last two days. 
  Turkmen president Saparmurat Niyazov received the commanders 
on Monday morning. At the reception, the Turkmen president 
pointed to the importance of political factors which, emerging 
under the influence of new processes, affect positively 
relations between neighbouring states. 
  He instanced relations between Turkmenistan, on the one 
hand, 
Russia and Iran, on the other, which, "thanks to mutual respect 
and trust, opened a possibility to find ways for settling all 
problems, including border issues". 
  Niyazov singled out the factor of inviolability of the 
present borders as a guarantee of peace and quietude, stressing 
that his recent talks with Iranian President Rafsanjani 
"revealed full concurrence of the two leaders' views on these 
and other issues of cooperation". 
  "While touring the world, we saw that there were no borders 
with barbed wire anywhere. They remain only as a heritage of 
the former Soviet Union," Niyazov noted. He expressed hope in 
this connection that the present Ashgabat meeting and the 
following ones will bring closer the solution of problems 
existing on CIS borders.

<F P=106> [Oleg Falichev article: "View of the Problem. The </F>
President's Eyes and Ears, or How the Missile Attack Early 
Warning System Operates Following the Breakup of the USSR"] 
  [Text] The top-secret missile attack early warning system 
[MAEW] was certainly assigned a special role among the strategic 
deterrence systems developed in the USSR during the Cold War 
years. Why? It provided the president, the country's 
military-political leadership, and the command of the branches 
of the Armed Forces with the information needed to adopt a 
definitive decision regarding the use of nuclear missile forces. 
That is, it can be said to have been in the direct sense of the 
word the eyes and ears of the country's leadership. 
  Today the Cold War is behind us. The Soviet Union does not 
exist. Many over the horizon [OTH] tracking stations, the basis 
of the MAEW, have ended up over the border. Furthermore, the 
geopolitical position of Russia itself has changed. How has all 
this affected the combat readiness of the system and the lives 
and service of the troops? 
  Here were are on the outskirts of Moscow. The trees are 
covered with snow. Before us is an outwardly unremarkable 
building, which has so to speak been legendary for many years. 
This is an MAEW command post, and no journalist has set foot 
inside it in its entire existence. 
  Inside the light is dim and the duty shift wear soft 
footwear. There are telephones to the defense minister and the 
chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff on 
the duty officer's desk.... Opposite stands a huge panel, the 
size of the screen at Moscow's "Rossiya" Movie Theater, 
indicating the operational situation, the movement of space 
objects, and the status and operation of OTH tracking stations 
tracking near-earth space, satellites in near-earth orbit, and 
all launches of carrier missiles that come within the zone of 
visibility.... Figuratively speaking, the key to our strategic 
security is here in this room.... 
  It is here that the alarming inscription suddenly flashes 
from time to time (for training purposes): "Stand by. Launch. 
Missile Attack." Whereupon it gives the launch site, the 
number of missiles, and where they are targeted.... This 
information automatically enters the special "Krokus" device 
which is then used to activate the "nuclear attache case" held 
by the country's president. At the same time it is accompanied 
by an audio signal, which was said to have irritated M. 
Gorbachev a great deal. This is said to have ended in the 
"Krokus" being rapidly removed from his office. 
  As for the people stationed at the command post day and 
night 
(the duty officer, the systems analysts, and officers in the 
analytical service...), throughout the Cold War they were 
destined to be the first to learn of the start of the nuclear 
apocalypse. Cynical as it sounds, their job is to anticipate 
nuclear war. 
  Information comes into the multicolored command post panel 
today from eight MAEW stations, five of them located abroad: in 
Ukraine (Mukachevo and Sevastopol), Azerbaijan (Mingechaur), 
Kazakhstan (Balkhash), and Latvia (Skrunda). They are still 
providing information, but what guarantee is there that it will 
not suddenly stop one fine day? 
  From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's file. 
  The development and creation of OTH MAEW and space 
surveillance radars began in our country in the sixties at the 
USSR Academy of Sciences Radiotechnical Research Institute under 
the leadership of Academician A.L. Mints. The first "Dnepr" 
stations were deployed in Kazakhstan and Siberia, forming a 
tight radar barrier 5,000-km long ensuring the accurate 
detection and tracking of space objects. During the seventies 
it proved possible to expand the radar field by including 
stations in the polar region, Latvia, and Ukraine. 
  A plan was then developed for total, continuous OTH 
coverage in the missile-vulnerable western, southwestern, 
southern, and northeastern sectors. At the same time work was 
also under way on a fundamentally new phased-array OTH radar 
station called "Daryal".... 
  As we can see, the system was progressively built in 
missile-vulnerable areas. Needless to say, at the time no one 
thought that the Union would break up and that the radar field 
erected would be bisected by the national borders of sovereign 
states. Or that they would de facto end up under Russia's 
"nuclear umbrella." However, now the question is this: Do the 
republics need these services today? And, if so, on what terms? 
If not, what is to be done with the stations? 
  Regrettably these are not idle questions, since there are 
still no clear accords in this sphere or clear prospects. 
Admittedly there is the Treaty on Collective Security signed by 
six CIS states. But "nothing is forever".... Remember the 
promises about the unified ruble, economic, and information 
area. What has happened to all that? Is it true that the 
future of these stations and maybe the future of the MAEW is 
today being decided not only in Moscow but also in the CIS 
nation states? 
  ...The Balkhash area, where an MAEW unit is stationed, 
greeted us with cold gusts of wind and snow. A strange building 
like a gigantic hut rose above the wild semidesert. 
  "Our new `Daryal' looks strange and, you'll agree, 
impressive," Colonel G. Kozlyuk, deputy commander for work with 
personnel, broke into my thoughts. "The only thing is that the 
construction workers and fitters are unable to hand it over. So 
at the moment we are working with a `Dnepr.'" 
  Vast sums of money at the old prices have been invested in 
the station -- around 1 billion rubles. It is a reliable 
radar. It has triple-redundant technological apparatus, several 
independent power sources, and space, radio, and facsimile 
communications.... It provides highly important information 
about ballistic missile launches, identifies objects during the 
booster phase of their flight path, and can instantly compute 
warheads' launch and landing sites as well as their flight 
time.... 
  "We provided backup for the `Soyuz-Apollo' flight and all 
flights from Baykonur and obtained information on `Ferret,' 
`Columbia,' and the shuttle," Colonel N. Buchuk, deputy 
commander for arms, said not without pride. 
  The MAEW has never given a false alarm regarding a missile 
attack (unlike its U.S. counterpart). But the "Dnepr's" have 
virtually outlived their service life, working continuously 
throughout this period. 
  It became clear that the almost complete new "Daryal" 
station 
is not at its best. 
  "Everything is vague now," Deputy Chief Designer Yu. Konkin, 
who leads a wretched life here now with an uncertain future, 
told me. "So it is not surprising if the equipment gradually 
gets neglected...." 
  Regrettably, signs of this neglect are already striking, to 
whit "explosive" old electric cable in the living quarters, 
empty shelves in the military trading store, the boarded-up 
windows of empty apartments, and the lack of clear guarantees 
for the officers that they will be provided with amenities in 
Russia.... Major General Yu. Kabakov, army deputy commander for 
rear services, involuntarily added to the picture by citing the 
following figure: "Compared with former conditions, supplies to 
our units in neighboring countries have dropped by around 40 
percent, although the tasks have remained the same." 
  The various restrictions on the movement of freight and 
property and the confusion over supplies represent another 
barrier. In terms of some categories the unit remains on 
Kazakhstan's payroll, whereas as far as others are concerned it 
has been transferred to the Ural Military District. 
Realistically at the moment the unit doesn't know whether it is 
coming or going. And virtually everything -- from uniform 
badges to pipes -- has to be brought by air from Moscow. You 
can imagine the kind of megabucks this costs, but there is 
evidently no choice at the moment. 
  Needless to say all this cannot fail to affect the people, 
their mood, and ultimately their attitude to their work. 
  It is becoming more and more difficult to get replacements 
for these units from Russia, Colonel Ye. Tokarev, head of the 
army cadre department, thinks. 
  Nonetheless at the moment, we would stress, all this is 
only indirectly affecting the unit's combat readiness. A 
commission from the Center led by Major General V. Pronov, the 
formation's chief of staff, came here to work and pointed to the 
reliability of the whole complex. It investigated a great deal 
and set a great deal to rights, so to speak. The unit received 
good marks, but its status remains unchanged. "We have no 
future here...," one officer told me bluntly. 
  Why is that happening in our country? The people who have to 
"pull" the strategic installation out of the mire without 
receiving proper pay, in many respects through personal 
initiative and self-restraint, should be rewarded, but they 
"have no future." Why did we make such a mess of the identical 
installation in Krasnoyarsk, owing to then Foreign Minister E.A. 
Shevardnadze's, so to speak, tractability and under pressure 
from the Americans, and why are we now turning it into...a 
furniture factory? At a time when the United States has not 
just failed to mothball its long-range tracking radar in 
Greenland but has even modernized it and has absolutely no 
intention of cutting back its other stations. 
  From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file: 
  The U.S. BMEWS ballistic missile early warning system 
is established and operating. It comprises three posts on 
Fylingdales Moor (Britain), in Thule (Greenland), and in Clear 
(Alaska), which have been modernized in recent years to enable 
the system to detect missiles at long range. This system uses a 
multifunctional Precision Approach Radar station comprising a 
"Safeguard" ABM defense system. During the eighties more 
powerful assemblies of the Pave Paws OTH stations were deployed 
on U.S. eastern and western seaboards and southern borders. The 
NORAD command post in Colorado Springs exercises operational 
control of the entire nuclear missile early warning system. 
  There is also a first-echelon tracking missile launches 
and engaged in nuclear burst fix acquisition -- five "IMEWS-2" 
artificial earth satellites in orbit at distances of 
30,000-40,000 km. This system still monitors the entire surface 
of our planet, including Russia and the CIS. And in spring 1993 
during the Western European Union's military and scientific 
conference the question was raised of creating a European ABM 
defense system (EUROWISAT) combined with similar U.S. systems. 
Its deployment is scheduled for the year 2005. 
  So the breakup of the Union cannot so far be said to have 
had 
any effect on the MAEW. But there are problems, as we can see. 
Above all, the question of the status of MAEW units abroad needs 
to be resolved most speedily. Regrettably, everything is not as 
easy as we would like. Kazakhstan, for instance, has a bone to 
pick with the Russian military over use of its airspace, 
fulfillment of customs regulations, etc. But that is not the 
main thing. Major General A. Kasymov, chief of the Main Staff 
of the Kazakhstan Armed Forces, gave his view of the problem as 
follows: "The question of the future of the MAEW unit is in my 
view linked to the question of Kazakhstan's accession to the 
1972 ABM Treaty. We know the Russian Federation's stance: 
People say that Kazakhstan cannot be a party to the treaty 
because it does not have the status of a nuclear state.... But 
this treaty must be reviewed today to take account of the 
opinions of states with elements of the strategic nuclear forces 
stationed on their territory It is therefore necessary to lay 
down new conditions for the creation of the `nuclear club,' 
either on a multilateral basis or on a bilateral basis with 
Russia. And to record these in a corresponding protocol like 
the Lisbon Protocol...." 
  S. Tyurin, Russian consul in Kazakhstan, is inclined to 
think 
that Russia should be quicker in making up its mind about the 
status of the MAEW military unit in Kazakhstan: "I am not a 
military man, but I believe that this unit is a very important 
installation, spearheading scientific and technical progress. 
And failure to pay attention to it will cause us a setback just 
like the earlier setback with Baykonur in terms of the space 
program. At the moment -- this is a fact -- the military are 
surviving here as best they can. You cannot describe them as 
occupiers, since their main weapon is radar equipment...." 
  Everyday material and technical difficulties are a minor 
misfortune. It is their uncertain status that is causing 
discord among the officers and the personnel. The republic has 
after all adopted a law laying downm that anyone who does not 
apply for other citizenship by 1 March automatically becomes a 
citizen of Kazakhstan.... So you can understand their position. 
And, moreover, that of their wives and school-age children, who 
are not particularly enthusiastic about the need for mandatory 
study of the Kazakh language in local schools or about obtaining 
secondary education certificates here. Not to mention the fact 
that there are Kazakhstani security and prosecutor's office 
organs at the garrison.... Colonel General (Retired) Yu. 
Votintsev, one of the people who developed the MAEW system, 
believes that a sorry fate lies in store for these installations 
if the problems are not resolved. "The outdated `Dnepr' 
stations will be able to operate for another two or three years, 
six years at most, and then the whole Commonwealth will be left 
without some of the most accurate means of detecting attacking 
missiles." However, owing to the dismantling of the Krasnoyarsk 
radar a gap has already formed in our OTH tracking systems in 
the northeast of the country. Therefore logic itself suggests 
that it is necessary to at least preserve what is left. 
  "The point is that the highly effective system only works 
when it receives information from all OTH tracking stations. It 
would therefore evidently be right for the MAEW to be not a 
national but a supranational system," Lieutenant General S. 
Sokolov, MAEW army commander, said. "And, naturally, it would 
have other CIS countries taking a shared financial part in 
running it." 
  The Main Staff of the Air Defense Troops takes a similar 
view. 
  "Whether we need this installation or not is not under 
discussion," Colonel General V. Smirnov, commander of the 
missile-space defense troops, said. "But, in order to resolve 
the problems arising there, an agreement is first needed on 
Russian-Kazakhstani military cooperation -- an agreement which 
is not yet in place." 
  Well, this would evidently be the optimum solution to the 
very difficult situation that has developed since the breakup of 
the USSR as far as preserving the MAEW installations is 
concerned. It is after all easy to destroy things -- something 
that we have repeatedly seen over the last few years -- but it 
is hard to create them. The MAEW embodied the best achievements 
of many generations' intellectual potential. And, however 
stable the world may be today, it was, is, and remains a crucial 
deterrent against the unleashing of a nuclear missile war. 
  A final point. A session of the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry Collegium was held recently. It analyzed the results 
of the Russian Federation's military cooperation with 
neighboring states and identified tasks for 1994. It was 
stressed that, as a result of joint work on the part of the 
Russian Federation Defense and Foreign Ministries, a 
normative-legal base has by and large been created for 
military-political and military-technical cooperation with the 
republics of the former USSR. It was pointed out at the same 
time that, in view of Russia's strategic interests in this 
sphere, there are still plenty of unresolved questions. 
  It only remains to hope that the necessary decisions on 
strategic arms will not be shelved. After all, the fate of the 
military and their relatives and friends depends on them. And 
ultimately the reliability of Russia's defense itself.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- Russian newspapers 
highlight a major event of the day -- the opening of a session 
of the newly elected parliament of the country -- the Federal 
Assembly. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, while noting that for 11 days Russia 
has 
had no parliament at all, points out that by the beginning of 
the session the deputies' factions in the State Duma have failed 
to reach agreement on important questions, despite numerous 
talkfests. 
  "As far as the Federation Council session, opening here on 
Tuesday, is concerned, one can suppose that a struggle for 
leading positions in it will be no less tough than that in the 
Duma." 
  TRUD on the Federal Assembly functioning: 
  "The legal life of the Federal Assembly begins today. Will 
it be marked by an end to antagonism between branches of power 
and by businesslike contacts between the parliament and the 
government? It is only businesslike contacts that can bring 
reassurance and future material wellbeing to the country". 
  PRAVDA on the first State Duma session: 
  "The first day of the session of the State Duma will be 
decisive... Despite a certain played-up excitement, the general 
impression is that the deputies want and are prepared to work 
efficiently". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Yuriy Baturin 
who was recently appointed the first assistant to the president 
of Russia on national security affairs. 
  Having pointed out that there are a lot of difficult tasks 
in 
this field, Baturin emphasised that "Russia's national security 
existed before and is still being elaborated". His opinion is 
that the concept "should be continuously modified in response to 
changing conditions. In our days, conditions change fast". 
  TRUD runs an interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy 
director of Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) 
which was founded by a presidential decree. 
  Stepashin dwelt on how the newly-established service differs 
from the old one and singled out six main tasks of the FCIS, the 
first among them being "to expose, prevent and put a stop to 
intelligence and subversive activities of foreign secret 
services and organisations against Russia". 
  PRAVDA carries notes by Former Russian Parliament Speaker 
Ruslan Khasbulatov. The notes, dated October 3, last year, are 
headlined "Notes from the `White House'". Khasbulatov analyses 
the situation in Russia after the August of 1991, expresses 
considerations about "direct motives for the anti-state coup" 
(as Khasbulatov describes the presidential decision to terminate 
the functioning of the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's 
Deputies -- note by ITAR- TASS), and criticises President Boris 
Yeltsin's policy, the kingpin of which, as Khasbulatov 
maintains, is "antagonism and confrontation" 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Ramiz Rizayev, 
Azerbaijan's plenipotentiary representative in Russia, who 
denied information that Afghan mojahedin take part in combat 
operations on Azerbaijan's side in the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  In SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, Vladimir Isakov, former people's 
deputy of Russia and one of the leaders of the National 
Salvation Front, strongly criticises the current privatisation 
policy. He believes that "everything seems to indicate that 
privatisation in Russia will go down in history as an example of 
unprecedented and shocking social hypocrisy". 
  PRAVDA on President Clinton's forthcoming visit to Moscow: 
  "The U.S. delegation again has in its bag more pieces of 
advice and political declarations than specific economic 
programs, and, most importantly, funds for their realisation".

  [Text] According to the latest information obtained from 
the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army Press Service, 
the Azerbaijani side has been carrying out a large-scale 
offensive all along the war front since 0700 this morning. The 
enemy directed its main thrust in the direction of Matagis and 
Hakop Kamari [Lulasaz] in Mardakertskiy Rayon in northern 
Karabakh, Agdam-Askeran in the east, and Fizuli-Gadrut in the 
south. 
  In the afternoon, the Armenian forces managed to halt the 
offensive and then regrouped and launched a counterattack. The 
Karabakh Defense Army units managed to encircle and destroyed a 
large enemy Army unit made up of two battalions, that is, 300 
soldiers, which was moving in the direction of Matagis and 
Hagop-Kamari. (Two) were killed and 15 injured on the Armenian 
side. 
  Again, following fierce battles in the direction of 
Agdam-Askeran, in the afternoon the Karabakh formations managed 
to halt the Azerbaijani advances and completely destroy an enemy 
battalion, nearly 200 soldiers. 
  An important post was ceded to the enemy in Martuninskiy 
Rayon in the morning. However, it was retaken in the afternoon. 
Here, Azerbaijanis lost 30 soldiers. There are injured on the 
Armenian side and their numbers are being determined. 
  The Karabakh Defense Army units' operations were more 
successful in the southern war front in the direction of 
Fizuli-Gadrut. There, they halted the enemy's attack and then 
launched a counteroffensive and penetrated 12 km into enemy 
territory. According to preliminary reports, both sides have 
losses in this sector, and casualty figures are being determined. 
  The same source reports that the Azerbaijani side used the 
Air Force today. The aircraft violated NKR's airspace but did 
not take part in the combat operations, apparently their purpose 
was reconnaissance. 
  Battles were still continuing all along the Karabakh fronts 
as of 1830 today.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Armenian Government in Yerevan on 8 </F>
January] 
  [Text] Having once again rejected the CSCE and the Russian 
Federation plan for the peaceful resolution of the Karabakh 
conflict, Azerbaijan unilaterally renounced the cease-fire and 
launched new military operations, not only against 
Nagorno-Karbakh but also all along the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
border. This time an intensified economic blockade, now being 
implemented even on the territory of a neutral country, is 
accompanying the military operations. The gas pipeline entering 
Armenia was again blown up on Georgian territory. It has not 
yet been repaired. 
  All this proves that Azerbaijan, having chosen the use of 
force as the only way to solve the problem, is trying at all 
costs to drag Armenia into the conflict. Azerbaijan is 
attempting to internationalize the conflict by using armed men 
from other countries in its combat operations. It obstinately 
tries to implement a visionless plan: Every time its aggressive 
operations fail, it resorts to every propaganda gimmick to 
present itself to the international community and various 
international forums as the victim of Armenian aggression. All 
such statements are then followed by massive new offensives. 
  The Armenian Government resolutely condemns Azerbaijan's 
policy of solving the problem by the use of force, a policy that 
is fraught with the danger of the eventual deepening of the 
conflict between the two peoples and will in the end lead to 
further human loss on the Azerbaijani side and diminish the 
possibility of a peaceful resolution of the Karabakh-Azerbaijani 
conflict. 
  Armenia has always favored a peaceful solution to the 
problem 
and is ready to continue its efforts in this direction.

<F P=106> [Report by Gevorg Nazaryan on news conference held by </F>
presidential Press Secretary Aram Abrahamyan in Yerevan on 10 
January] 
  [Text] Today's news conference was of interest for 
reporters not only because it was the first of the year but 
because recently the political situation has become tense in the 
Karabakh conflict zone and in Armenian-Georgian border regions. 
  In congratulating the reporters on the occasion of the new 
year, Press Secretary Aram Abrahamyan said: 
  [Begin Abrahamyan recording] As is already known to you, an 
unprecedented escalation of military operations has been taking 
place in Nagorno--Karabakh since 18 December. Having rejected 
every peace plan, Azerbaijan is launching fierce offensives all 
along the Karabakh-Azerbaijan front. The Azerbaijani 
infringements have taken place against our Republic in recent 
days. The political assessment of these operations has already 
been made in the statements issued by the Republic's president 
and government. 
  Azerbaijan is again entertaining the illusion that the 
problem could be solved by military means. The neighboring 
country is always paying dearly to be convinced that such 
illusions do not conform with reality. 
  Regarding our position, Armenia has always realized that 
there is no military solution to the problem. Therefore, the 
Armenian leadership will use all the possibilities, even the 
infinitesimal ones, at its disposal to make the problem a 
political one. [end recording] 
  Regarding Armenian-Russian relations, the press secretary 
said that they are stable and practical. As you know, the 
Armenian prime minister was in Moscow at the beginning of this 
year. The result was positive on the three main issues under 
discussion: the nuclear power plant, unfreezing of credits, and 
trade-economic relations between the countries in 1994. 
  Mr. Abrahamyan referred to the reoperation of the gas 
pipeline entering Armenia through Georgia. It is obvious that 
in this case also we are dealing with one of the worst 
manifestations of the Azerbaijani militaristic policy. The 
neighboring republic is sending terrorist and sabotage groups to 
another country, in this case Georgia, and is blowing up the 
only gas pipeline entering Armenia and is mining the area around 
the pipeline. The Armenian Government is taking various 
measures to resolve the gas pipeline issue. Following the 
meeting between the three deputy prime ministers of Armenia, 
Georgia, and Azerbaijan, there was a possibility that mine 
cleaning work would begin. However, certain problems have 
arisen between the bordering Armenian and Azerbaijani villages, 
delaying the mine cleaning work. 
  Mr. Abrahamyan informed reporters of the difficulties of 
obtaining fuel by the Georgian railway. Stable state structures 
have not yet taken shape in Georgia and the state is not in full 
control of the situation. Talks with the Georgian Government 
are continuing at various levels, and there is positive movement 
on the issues under discussion. 
  The press secretary noted that U.S. colleagues have not yet 
succeeded in bringing heating oil to Armenia as part of 
humanitarian assistance. 
  As you also know, the Armenian president called for a 
Supreme 
Council meeting on 12 January to discuss the 1994 program for 
privatization. This program, as well as the 1994 socio-economic 
plan submitted to the parliament, arise from the situation 
prevailing in our Republic. There are plans to private a total 
of 15 percent of the industrial enterprises. Abrahamyan said: 
We hope that this will stimulate the development of industry. 
  The press secretary also said that Vice President Gagik 
Arutyunyan will leave for Zangezur [southern Armenia] on 11 
January. The next day, an extraordinary session of the 
Coordination Council on Armenian-Iranian ties will be held in 
Megri. In addition to the members of the council, 
representatives from all the interested organizations, local 
authorities, customs posts, border guards, and business circles 
in both countries have also been invited to the meeting. It is 
expected that [Iranian charge d'affaires in Yerevan] Ahmad 
Sobhani and [Armenian charge d'affaires in Tehran] Vahan 
Bayburdyan will also take part in the meeting. The entire 
complex of Armenian-Iranian economic-trade ties will be 
examined, such as the construction of the bridge, transit 
transportation, border trade, the normal functioning of customs 
posts, and so on.

  [Text] Yerevan, January 10 (SNARK)--Vahan Papazyan, 
Armenian foreign affairs minister, mentioned today that the 
appeal to the terror and bloodshed should be punished. Recently 
speaking in Vanadzor Garnik Isagulyan, deputy of the Armenian 
Parliament and a representative of the "Dashnaktsutyun" Party 
[Armenia Revolutionary Federation], accused Armenian authorities 
declaring that "the Foreign Affairs Minister Papazyan did with 
the pornoproduction [word as received] trade". In his turn 
Vahan Papazyan appealed to the "Dashnaktsutyun" making the party 
specify the attitude to Isagulyan and expressed his sorrow in 
connection with the fact that "Armenian Parliament is not only 
unable to express his attitude but to accuse the deputy of his 
declarations".

  [Text] Following the publication in the 7 January edition 
of HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN of a statement made in Vanadzor by 
Garnik Isagulyan, an Armenian parliamentarian, member of the 
Armenian Revolutionary Federation [ARF], and member of the ARF's 
parliamentary group, the Armenian Foreign Ministry Press Service 
asked Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan to comment on Isagulyan's 
statements. 
  Papazyan said: I think the ARF must publicly clarify its 
position on this member because the Armenian security organs 
must know whose political views Isagulyan expressed--his own or 
ARF's. If they are party views, then the Armenian Justice 
Ministry must open a serious investigation into the ARF's 
programs and decide on the legality of the party. 
  It would be logical to expect parliament to express its 
position on a member. 
  Regrettably, this is not the first time a deputy of the 
Armenian Supreme Council has issued overt or covert threats or 
calls to topple the government in an illegitimate way. Sadly, 
our parliament has never shown enough strength to react to or 
condemn such behavior by a member. 
  The case is already extremely bizarre. An open call for 
terror and bloodshed by a deputy cannot go unpunished. Any 
self-respecting parliament would have stripped a deputy of his 
mandate for such a statement. I think that this time around 
parliament has no right to remain silent. 
  As for the calumny directed against the Armenian foreign 
minister--who does the orator have in mind? He has mentioned no 
specific name. The previous foreign minister was also appointed 
by the same authorities. In that case too the calumny would 
have been as disgusting. Isagulyan must be brought before the 
court. If he made his fiery revolutionary rhetoric in a 
feverish moment or under the influence of alcohol or drugs or if 
he is suffering psychological trouble -- his statement does 
leave that impression -- this should represent extenuating 
circumstances for Garnik Isgulyan, as long as this is confirmed 
by an authorized medical group and made public. 
  Personally in such cases I try to persist despite my heavy 
workload and regardless of the personal worth of the author of 
calumny. If we aspire to a law-based state we must realize that 
each of us must persist so that laws in the Republic can finally 
take effect, Papazyan concluded.

  [Text] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border is not 
calm. According to officers of the Russian operational group in 
Dushanbe, over the past few days the Tajik opposition has 
continued its armed provocations from the territory of 
Afghanistan. The 12th and 13th outposts of the Russian border 
troops and the positions of the servicemen of the Russian 201st 
Motorized Rifle Division are being subjected to sporadic firing. 
Fortunately there are no casualties among the servicemen of the 
Russian Federation. 
  According to the Russian military, the new spiral of tension 
on the border has been caused by the exacerbation of the 
military and political situation in Afghanistan, where clashes 
between various conflicting groups are taking place.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Yakov report: "No Shooting at Russian Border Guard </F>
Subunits on This Occasion"] 
  [Text] Sundry news reports over the last few days have 
repeatedly announced that the Moscow Border Guard Troops 13th 
Subunit in Tajikistan had come under missile fire Saturday and 
Sunday [8-9 January]. The Russian Border Guard Troops Press 
Bureau refutes these reports. 
  There was indeed fire along the border over the weekend, as 
reported by INTERFAX citing the headquarters of Russian Border 
Guard Troops in Tajikistan. But for some unknown reason the 
report went on to identify the 13th Subunit and even mentioned 
the exact number of missiles launched against it -- five on 
Saturday and seven on Sunday. Moreover, the time when they were 
fired was given down to the minute. 
  On hearing this report on the radio, the duty operations 
officers at Border Guard Troops headquarters in Moscow were 
initially alarmed: Why had they not been informed of these 
facts? It proved to be a false alarm. In actual fact -- and 
reports to this effect had arrived at headquarters -- Tajik 
opposition gunmen had fired mortars and recoilless rifles at 
positions held by border guard troops from the 12th Subunit on 7 
January. 
  On Saturday the gunmen launched five rocket-propelled 
projectiles and fired two recoilless rifle rounds at the village 
of Pervar. On Sunday, again using recoilless rifles, they fired 
eight rounds at the village of Arvar. The fire came from the 
territory of Tajikistan. Both villages are located in the zone 
controlled by the 12th Border Guard Troops Subunit and the 
gunmen's positions came under appropriate retaliatory fire. We 
are very happy to report that there have been no casualties 
among servicemen from the 12th Subunit, let alone from the 13th 
Subunit.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] During the past week as well as during the first 
days after the 18th session of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan, 
the deterioration of the situation in relations between the 
Center and Leninabad oblast has not decreased. On the contrary 
it [deterioration of situation] has been increased. 
  The Parliamentary coup, as a result of which the dynasty of 
ex-Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdullodzanov fell, became the theme 
of a lot of talks in different circles in Khujand. 
  According to a report on Radio Liberty, this event in 
particular became the reason for the intense rivalry between the 
ethnic groups and political disputes between the dynasties which 
are fighting for power. 
  A well known Tajik journalist [word indistinct] writes: The 
existence of the groups and the dynasties which are fighting for 
power in Tajikistan is a reality which one cannot deny. At no 
other time was the government of Tajikistan in such a state of 
disarray and mistrust. The politicians are developing the 
spirit of the local tendencies by their actions among the 
citizens and explain all their mistakes and failures only 
because of the existence of misunderstandings between the groups 
and the dynasties. 
  Recently, thanks to the efforts of the so-called Kulyabi 
dynasty, the representatives of the Khujand dynasty [words 
indistinct] Abdullodzanov, former chairman of the Council of 
Ministers and his relatives, Homidov, chairman of the executive 
committee of Leninabad oblast and his supporters were removed 
from power. Abdulmadjid (?Dostiyev), first deputy chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan and Abdulmadjid Samadov the new 
prime minister arrived in Khujand during the final days of 1993. 
They have relieved (?Abujalil Homidov), [chairman of the 
executive committee of Leninabad oblast] as well as the 
prosecutor of the oblast, the head of department of Internal 
Affairs and the head of the National Security Committee of the 
oblast of their posts and have appointed to these posts the 
people who are loyal to the Central government. 
  According to the latest news, (?Homidov) is at present at 
the 
government hospital of Tashkent city. Ergash Kurbonov, the 
other representative of this dynasty who was the head of the 
Leninabad oblast National Security Committee and who took the 
initiative in killing and arresting hundreds of opposition 
supporters have fled the oblast. Kurbonov, being an experienced 
employee of the KGB and former chairman of Committee on 
Legislation and the Human Rights of the Parliament of 
Tajikistan, has played a big role during the bloody events of 
Tajikistan. In particular, he took a great part in formation of 
the people's front in Syrkhandarya oblast of Uzbekistan and 
exerting big pressure on the people's deputies in the town of 
Khujand during the historical [16th] session of the Supreme 
Soviet of Tajikistan. And it was Ergash Kurbonov, who by the 
order of Rakhmanov forced the deputies of Leninabad oblast to 
abandon their separatist views and to come to Dushanbe for the 
18th session of the Supreme Soviet. 
  But all these worthy services of the latter could not change 
the decision of Dushanbe with respect to him. The oblast 
[Leninabad] calmly reacted to the forced resignation of its 
leaders. According to many analysts, the reason of this is that 
Abdullojonov and Homidov have transformed the new economic 
structures in oblast into their dynasty's monopoly and caused 
hindrance to dozens of businessmen and entrepreneurs. That is 
why this middle class of the Khujandi society have approved the 
sudden changes; but on the contrary the reaction of the 
leadership of the neighboring Republic of Uzbekistan to these 
events was provocative. 
  Right after the resignation of the top persons of Leninabad 
oblast, two platoons of the army of Uzbekistan left 
Tavildarinskiy rayon and one platoon left the mountainous region 
of Mastchoh and Aniyskiy, former Zahmatobod, rayon and returned 
to Tashkent. 
  The relations between Imamali Rakhmanov, chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan and Uzbek President Islam Karimov 
have become further complicated. All of these are evidence to 
the fact that lately the leadership of Uzbekistan had relied on 
Abdullojonov and Homidov. In particular the proposals related 
to revival of the presidential structure and nomination of 
(?Homidov) to this post could be the evidence of this. It is 
thought that these proposals have been started from Tashkent. 
The support given to the above- mentioned proposals by Uzbek 
speaking deputies of the Parliament and the Society of Uzbeks of 
Tajikistan also point to the same conclusion. 
  The measures of Tashkent with respect to Imamali Rakhmanov 
took place at the time when the latter has established close 
relations with Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani. It is 
possible that the latest events in Afghanistan may be connected 
with these political games. At present, the units and companies 
of the Uzbek Army have only remained in the border region of 
Shaartuzskiy rayon and their presence is because of the events 
in Afghanistan. 
  Similarly, protection of the Tajik-Uzbek border in the north 
has been reinforced after the changes in Khujand. Tashkent 
fears that in the case of the deterioration of the situation in 
Khujand oblast [as heard], the unrest could spread to Fergana, 
Syrdarya, Tashkent, Dzhisakh, Samarkand and Bukhara oblasts. 
  According to the opinions of the local observers, the action 
of Imamali Rakhmanov related to relieving the leadership of 
Leninabad oblast of their post as well as resignation of 
Abdullojonov took place because of Russia's support. 
Essentially, all these rivalries are the result of 
contradictions between Russia and Uzbekistan in order to have 
influence in Tajikistan. However, according to analysts, the 
course of events could completely destroy the situation in the 
region and cause even greater bloodshed. The experts say that 
only finding a way of reconciliation between the government of 
Tajikistan and the Tajik opposition can solve this case.

  [Text] [video opens with shot of airliner taxiing] 
[Ganieyv] After lengthy tests, the aircraft builders of the 
Chkalov Aviation Production Association in Tashkent today 
released the first Il-114 passenger plane for use by the 
Uzbekistan airline. Hava Yolari, Uzbekistan's national airline, 
has acquired two of these planes. The comfortable passenger 
compartment has room for 64 people. The fundamentally new, 
multiblade, virtually silent engines are twice as powerful and 
economical as those of the An-24. It can even land and take off 
from a dirt strip. The cabin controls have been simplified as 
much as possible. Many of the instruments have been replaced by 
an on-board computer. The new plane will replace the outdated 
Yak-40 and An-24 on CIS internal routes. To be frank, this 
shows that once again the series production of modern equipment 
is reliant on economic integration between Russia, Uzbekistan, 
and other CIS states.. [video shows extensive views of aircraft

  [Text] Russia's former Prosecutor General Valentin 
Stepankov has dismissed various rumors concerning his fate after 
the early October events in Moscow. Right after the tragic 
developments of October 3 and 4 he decided to use up his annual 
leave for the past two years. After his vacation he resigned. 
  The new Prosecutor General, Aleksey Kazannik, signed his 
request for resignation without even interviewing him. "I 
resigned because the present office of prosecutor general with 
its new functions and powers does not conform to the model I had 
created," Stepankov stressed. 
  According to him, he has not been summoned yet as a witness 
in the legal proceedings connected with the October events, 
though he participated in them on both sides. 
  Beginning with September 21, Stepankov explained, he visited 
the parliament building more than once, where the congress of 
people's deputies was taking place, and attended sessions held 
at the headquarters led by First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets. 
  As Stepankov said, he is still out of work. He declined the 
only offer he received: the Foreign Trade Minister, Oleg 
Davydov, offered him a job abroad. 
  When asked by INTERFAX's correspondent why he had taken no 
part in the race for parliament, Stepankov said that his former 
work as a member of the Supreme Soviet had not satisfied him, 
and so he was not prepared to join the new parliament. "I 
belonged to no faction in the previous legislature, and now I 
have no wish to represent the interests of any party in the new 
parliament," Stepankov pointed out. 
  With reference to the case of those who plotted the failed 
August 1991 coup, the former prosecutor general said: "Now, 
looking back, some charges against myself could be revoked." 
According to Stepankov, at one time he was accused of 
procrastinating with investigations. "But those investigations 
began only four and a half months previously, and 9 months more 
were spent on acquainting the defendants and their lawyers with 
the materials. The trial has been in progress for over a year 
now, but only one defendant has been questioned so far."

government that the new government will be as little changed as 
possible, despite the reduction in numbers. Judging by all 
accounts, the candidates for the two first deputy chairmen of 
the government have already been decided. Oleg Soskovets and 
Yegor Gaydar will retain their former posts as first 
vice-premiers. This is shown by the fact that they have both 
taken an active part in drafting the president's decree on 
reforming the government. 
  The source also noted that members of the government will be 
of similar outlook, as they say, to Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
share his views on the implementation of economic reforms in the 
country. On the basis of that, the source said, it is most 
likely that the vice-premiers' posts will be taken by Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, who is responsible for the agricultural sector in 
the government, and Yuriy Yarov, who is in charge of social 
issues.

<F P=106> [Viktor Zamyatin, Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Personnel </F>
Shakeup in Russian Foreign Ministry. Minister Will Have New 
Deputies"] 
  [Text] The just completed New Year and Christmas season 
has brought about more changes in Russian diplomacy. According 
to information available to KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the question of 
appointing Aleksandr Panov, the current ambassador to Seoul, as 
deputy foreign minister, has for all intents and purposes been 
resolved. It has come to light simultaneously that Igor Ivanov, 
ambassador to Madrid, will probably become yet another deputy 
for Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Georgiy Kunadze, whose place will probably be taken by 
Aleksandr Panov, was in charge of Foreign Ministry personnel 
policy and relations with the countries of Asia and the Pacific 
region. Kunadze was not quite successful in the personnel job, 
though, some high-ranking diplomats note. One of the probable 
reasons is the fact that he has not been a career diplomat 
(before joining the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he was in 
academic science), which is why they argue on Smolenskaya 
Ploshchad that he could not entirely get rid of his "outsider" 
image. Last October, personnel work was entrusted to an 
"insider" -- Sergey Krylov -- and some time later, the question 
of Kunadze's appointment as ambassador to Seoul was resolved in 
principle. This leaves the Asia and Pacific region "untended," 
and now Aleksandr Panov is to step into this breach. 
  As for Igor Ivanov, according to some information, he is 
tipped to take the place of current First Deputy Minister 
Anatoliy Adamishin, who has become a member of parliament. It 
is still not clear, though, which Foreign Ministry areas he will 
be in charge of if one thinks that changes in the ministry's 
structure (and the redistribution of duties among top diplomats 
it entails) have not been yet completed.

  [Text] Russian Vice Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray 
believes that the presidential decree "On the structure of the 
federal bodies of executive power" was influenced by the 
following three factors: the political situation, adoption of 
the new constitution and the state of economy. In an interview 
with Interfax today, he pointed out that he listed the reasons 
for the decree in the descending order. 
  Shakhray declined to comment on individual provisions of the 
document, though pointing out that "this seems to be a fourth 
reshuffle of the government." He supposed that if they left 
more than one vice prime minister in the government, there will 
be more of them in future (according to a presidential decree, 
the prime minister shall have four vice prime ministers, two of 
them being first vice prime ministers - Interfax note.) 
  Shakhray said he had not received a proposal to chair the 
ministry for federation affairs and regional policies designed 
to replace the State Committee for Federation and Nationalities 
Affairs he chairs now.

<F P=106> [By CRIME-PRESS correspondents Sergey Oleynik and Vladimir </F>
Taranov] 
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 10 Jan -- The main task of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS], set up by a presidential 
edict to replace the former Security Ministry, is to prevent 
foreign special services from carrying out subversive activity 
against Russia. [passage omitted] 
  A number of subunits of the [former] Security Ministry have 
been transferred to the Federal Agency for Government 
Communications and to the directorate for protection of the 
government. 
  Unlike the Security Ministry, which was subordinated to both 
the president and the government, the FCS is subordinated 
directly to the Russian president. 
  A special attestation commission now working in the FCS will 
spend one month reassessing staff, Sergey Stepashin [deputy FCS 
director] said. The central apparatus will be reduced from 
3,500 to 1,500 employees. Sergey Stepashin said that, in a 
conversation with him, Yeltsin asked not for purges during the 
reorganization process but for selection of staff on the basis 
of professionalism, loyalty, and willingness to serve the 
country and state. Staff members who do not pass the 
attestation will not end up without a job, Sergey Stepashin 
said, but will be able to transfer to the Interior Ministry, the 
tax inspectorate or the general procuracy.

<F P=106> [By CRIME-PRESS correspondent Sergey Oleynik -- tass] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- The staff of the central 
Moscow headquarters of the Russian Counterintelligence Service 
will be reduced by more than a half and will go down from 3.500 
to 1.500 officers, first deputy director of the service Sergey 
Stepashin told a press conference on Monday. 
  Earlier spokesman of the service Aleksey Kondaurov told TASS 
that the total number of Russian counterintelligence officers 
will amount to 75.000 which is 46 per cent less than before the 
former Security Ministry was transformed into the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service. 
  Stepashin said that besides counterintelligence tasks, his 
service will, jointly with the Interior Ministry, fight 
political terrorism. 
  "The president, the government and the parliament have to 
know what's happening in the country. It is necessary to 
predict also situations connected with political terrorism, 
other actions aimed to overthrow the constitutional system", he 
said. 
  This task will be partially solved by the Interior Ministry 
and partially by the counterintelligence service, he added. 
  The main objective of the counterintelligence service, which 
directly reports to the president, is to cut short foreign 
spying and subversive activities against Russia, according to 
Stepashin. 
  The service will have a department of counterintelligence 
operations, of counterintelligence provision for strategic 
objects, of military and economic counterintelligence. 
  At the same time the former Security Ministry anti-organised 
crime department was transferred to the Interior Ministry, while 
the investigation department became a part of the office of the 
Russian prosecutor general. The former KGB investigation prison 
in Lefortovo was also trasferred to the Interior Ministry. The 
counterintelligence service, in its turn, nay get the "Alpha" 
and "Vympel" commando units.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Fatigarov report: "Russia's Counterintelligence -- </F>
Special Service Without Investigative Functions and Lefortovo"] 
  [Text] A press conference, timed to coincide with the 
creation of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], was 
held in Moscow yesterday. Taking part in it were Sergey 
Stepashin, first deputy director of the FCS, and Yuriy Baturin, 
assistant to the president of the Russian Federation for 
national security. 
  Henceforth the FCS, in terms of both its structure and its 
purpose, will be a special service which will in no way mirror 
the former Ministry of Security. In Sergey Stepashin's opinion, 
"all prerequisites for the revival of political surveillance 
have been destroyed." The new service is intended only to 
expose and terminate operations by foreign special services 
against the Russian Federation and "to acquire information about 
threats to our country's security." It is also tasked with 
waging a struggle against terrorism, the imports of weapons and 
drugs, and the struggle against illegal armed formations. 
Despite the fact that the Border Guard Troops have evolved into 
an autonomous service, the FCS will continue to provide 
counterintelligence backup for the effective protection of 
Russia's state borders. 
  Although the FCS is the successor of the former Ministry of 
Security, it will henceforth be subordinate only to the 
president. The service has parted with its Investigations 
Directorate, having transferred its establishment to the General 
Prosecutor's Office. And the notorious Lefortovo prison has been 
transferred to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. 
Nonetheless, the former Ministry of Security's operational and 
technical services remain under the FCS. The question about 
transferring the "Alpha" and "Vimpel" special subunits to the 
FCS has not been raised yet. 
  According to Stepashin, the FCS's creation became necessary 
in light of the growing corruption within power structures, the 
stepped up activity of foreign special services from both nearby 
and distant foreign countries, and the attempts to recruit state 
apparatus officials. Last year alone, 20 persons were sentenced 
for espionage against Russia. 
  The press conference participants also dwelled on the 
problems of social protection for FCS military personnel. 
Former Ministry of Security staffers who have failed the 
certification process can either transfer to other state 
structures or take retirement with all statutory benefits. 
  Cutbacks in the FCS's numerical strength have affected 
primarily the central apparatus. Whereas the service as a whole 
will be 46 percent smaller than the former Russian Federation 
Ministry of Security, the center will employ only 1,500 instead 
of 3,500 staffers. Cutbacks apply primarily to backup and 
management structures, rather than to operational structures.

<F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy report on interview with Yuriy Baturin, </F>
newly appointed assistant to the president for national 
security; place and date not given: "The Most Secure of the 
President's Assistants"] 
  [Text] The appointment of Yuriy Baturin, assistant to the 
president for legal affairs, to the specially instituted 
position of assistant to the president for national security 
created a sensation just before Christmas. Only time will tell 
whether this event will turn out to be a Christmas gift to the 
country, but for now this is what Yuriy Baturin told IZVESTIYA's 
correspondent about the circumstances surrounding his 
appointment to the new position. 
  President Yeltsin telephoned Baturin in his Kremlin office 5 
January and said, according to Baturin, literally the following: 
"I have come to the conclusion that it would be right for the 
president to have an assistant for national security. I would 
like you to be this assistant." 
  Doctor of Juridical Sciences Yuriy Baturin was offered his 
former position in the president's administration in April 1993 
and had almost two months to think it over and accept, with his 
formal appointment coming on 2 June 1993. But the tone in which 
the president's new request was couched ruled out any delays and 
Baturin agreed immediately. Being no doubt in possession of 
much more extensive information than he can reveal today, 
Baturin realized at that moment the precise nature of the danger 
threatening the president, the state, and Russia, the diverse 
interconnections, and the reason why a certain role in 
preventing this danger was being assigned by Boris Yeltsin 
precisely to him. 
  When describing Yuriy Baturin it is evidently necessary to 
dwell primarily not on his businesslike qualities, no matter how 
high they might be, but on his personal qualities. Being in 
many regards an "outsider" in the president's administration and 
a highly obstinate person who only superficially accepts the 
apparatus rules in operation there, Yuriy Baturin has 
nonetheless succeeded in integrating within the presidential 
apparatus, primarily due to the fact that he lacks personal 
political ambitions (his ambitions lie in some different 
sphere). He has the rare ability to abandon his personal 
motivation outside the offices he has occupied and, thanks to 
this, many people both in Yeltsin's apparatus and in Gorbachev's 
apparatus earlier on have found him to be an obstacle that is 
difficult to surmount, rather than a rival in the struggle for 
power and influence. 
  Baturin asked just one question during his 5 January 
telephone conversation with Yeltsin: Would he be able to carry 
on performing his duties as assistant to the president for legal 
affairs? The president replied that the nature and volume of 
his new duties would hardly allow him to physically cope with 
that, although there are no objections at all in principle to 
Baturin continuing to assist the president also in the sphere of 
his legal policy. A new assistant will evidently be appointed 
to replace him, someone from among a number of qualified jurists 
whom Baturin himself would be able to nominate, although the 
final choice will rest with the president. 
  During his conversation with IZVESTIYA's correspondent, 
Yuriy 
Baturin refused to offer an exhaustive definition (not even a 
list of general functions) of the extremely broad term "national 
security," claiming that it would be more appropriate to do so 
not in a newspaper interview but in the concept of national 
security which ought to be elaborated on a priority basis with 
his participation, but the principles and details thereof have 
not yet been coordinated with the president. 
  His appointment to the new position came as a complete 
surprise to Baturin and to everyone else, as did the earlier 
edict disbanding the Ministry of Security, which the former 
assistant to the president for legal affairs saw only after it 
had been signed. But, since the end of December, on Yeltsin's 
instructions, and in his former capacity, he has been taking 
part in elaborating the Statute of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS] jointly with the former 
leadership of the Ministry of Security, reported to the 
president on this matter, and the latter was evidently pleased 
with it. His practical experience of work with security organs 
is evidently limited to this. 
  Already exercising his new powers as assistant to the 
president for national security (incidentally, he is the only 
one of the president's assistants whose range of duties is 
enshrined in an official description of his office), during the 
Christmas holidays Yuriy Baturin met with FCS Head Nikolay 
Golushko and his first deputy Sergey Stepashin, and had a 
separate meeting with Colonel General Nikolayev, chief of the 
Federal Border Service. 
  Baturin will evidently have meetings in the very near future 
with the leadership of the Army, the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs], the Foreign Intelligence Service, and other structures 
which are conventionally described as "power structures." The 
separation of powers with the Security Council, which will 
continue to function under the president, is being clarified. 
According to Baturin, his appointment has not resulted in any 
changes regarding the future of leaders of the Presidential 
Protection Directorate, which has recently expanded its activity 
beyond the limits of strictly ensuring his personal protection 
right up to the setting up of its own analysis subunits. 
  Answering a question about the way his new activity fits in 
with his former beliefs, Baturin replied that he does not intend 
to "convert" and adapt his well-known and firmly held legal 
beliefs to some new tune. Especially since the law offers the 
basic system of security for citizens and the state alike. But 
the special services, whose activities will henceforth be in his 
charge, by their very nature operate in conditions of extreme 
necessity -- so who but a legal expert is best placed to define 
the criteria of such necessity and the limitations for any 
retreat from overall law and order permissible under extreme 
necessity, if it were to arise at all? 
  Yuriy Baturin evidently attaches priority importance in the 
sphere of national security to the creation of powerful 
analytical subunits which should, from this specific point of 
view, evaluate the objectives of the Russian state's national 
policy, including economic, legal, foreign, domestic, and 
regional state policy, as well as the means used to attain these 
objectives. Security primarily means the security of citizens, 
the president is perceived as the main guarantor of this 
security bearing total responsibility for it by virtue of his 
office, and state security is conceived in the key of the 
concept of a rule-of-law state, in other words a state which 
attaches paramount importance to the interests of its citizens 
and not of its functionaries.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1728 GMT on 10 January in a new, live program of news 
and analysis entitled "Details" [Podrobnosti], journalist 
Nikolay Svanidze interviewed Gennadiy Eduardovich Burbulis, of 
Russia's Choice. Svanidze opened the program by looking briefly 
at the immediate accommodation problems facing the new Federal 
Assembly over video of building work in progress. The interview 
was interspersed with brief voice excerpts over video of 
Chernomyrdin speaking on 5 January and of Yegor Gaydar speaking 
at today's press conference. 
  Svanidze began by asking Burbulis why the Russia's Choice 
faction left the talks over election of a parliamentary speaker. 
  Burbulis replied: "We realized that these talks had very 
little to do with the final results of electing a chairman. 
They were cunningly demonstrative and, moreover, the Russia's 
Choice bloc risked losing its political face which is something 
we cannot allow. We are very worried about the possible 
domination of parliament by two extremist political forces, 
namely the communist and national- fascist ones and we cannot be 
linked with decisions worked out hand- in-hand with them." 
  Svanidze then said: "I have learned that a split is 
developing in the Russia's Choice bloc, or rather has already 
developed. Incidentally, you were not there next to Gaydar today 
at the press conference, nor have you formally become one of the 
bloc's leaders and I have even learned from the lobbies that 
Andrey Makarov has sharply criticized Yegor Gaydar." Burbulis 
replied: "I think those observations are rather surface, 
superficial ones. We criticized not only Gaydar but also each 
other. Most importantly this partial assessment was needed to 
evaluate honestly the causes of the relative defeat that we 
suffered in the elections." Svanidze pressed him further: "If 
the criticism of Gaydar is connected with a search for reasons 
for the election defeat, then it would be logical to assume that 
you link this defeat with the name Gaydar?" Burbulis replied: 
"No it is not so simple, not so straightforward." 
  Asked whether the Russia's Choice faction should now lobby 
the present government, Burbulis said; "No I don't believe so 
and I think that it would be useful both for the government and 
for the country if our tactics were to draw a precise and clear 
distinction between those government actions and decisions which 
correspond to our notion of reform of the country's economy and 
those which do not correspond to it at all but which manifest 
contrary interests and aims." 
  Svanidze inquired: "So you do not like being associated with 
the government?" to which Burbulis responded: "We do not like 
this and we made a serious mistake in the election campaign when 
we took on full responsibility for the actions of the government 
and our opponents readily exploited this." 
  Burbulis added that Russia's Choice would very much like to 
be able to coordinate its actions with the president, actively 
and constructively and asserted that "the country needs a new 
political culture, a culture of coalitional activity. This is 
required of the president, it is required of the government and 
it is required of all of us." 
  Asked whether now he personally regarded himself as 
Yeltsin's 
political supporter, Burbulis said: "To the extent that the 
president adopts decisions and acts while preserving the 
country's reformist, democratic future, yes I am Yeltsin's 
supporter. Where his actions do not correspond to that future 
and where they give rise to considerable problems and 
difficulties in the system of government, I cannot support him 
and I will not support him." 
  On Russia's Choice's attitude toward Zhirinovskiy, Burbulis 
had this to say: "Any political or ideological contacts with 
Zhirinovskiy and his grouping are totally unacceptable until an 
assessment, including a legal one, has been made of the 
obscurantism which he has offered the country today." He added: 
"Any compromises with the national-fascist ideology which 
threatens to appear and find a mouth-piece in parliament are 
totally unacceptable," but he accepted that his faction would 
have to find a way of working with other factions in parliament.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1614 GMT on 10 January presents a program on Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) 
entitled "There Actually Is Such a Party" hosted by Sergey 
Torchinskiy. His studio guests are Zafar Maksudovich Fatkudinov, 
Academician at the Academy of Economy, Finances and Law, doctor 
of juridical sciences and a writer and Andrey Fedorovich 
Zavidiya, Chairman of the Galant company. 
  Asked to explain why he wanted to take part in the program, 
Zavidiya says: "Well, to be brief, there is currently too much 
noise around the LDPR's sensational victory at the parliamentary 
elections. As the main organizer of these victories, I bear my 
share of the responsibility for all the statements which 
Vladimir Volfovich subsequently made and that is why I am here: 
to debunk a myth, dispel some rumors and conjectures." 
  Zafar Fatkudinov explains that no single party was as 
skilled 
as the LDPR in capitalizing on people's fears, emotions and gut 
feelings, hence its electoral victory. 
  Andrey Zavidiya then says, "The point is that the LDPR's 
program and its rules are completely out of sync with Vladimir 
Volfovich statements." Zavidiya shows the viewers 
Zhirinovskiy's "The Last Push South" and the party's program, 
entitled "The Liberal- Democratic Party of the Soviet Union -- 
Documents and Materials" and says that the party's program "is a 
fine program. I recall that when I paid for it, it was 26,000 
-- the Zavidiya firm paid for the LDPR's program in 1991. Let 
me just remind you that I was, I am, and will remain a rank and 
file communist and that it is possible and desirable to 
cooperate, if not with everyone, then with the majority. I have 
practically no objections to this program and that is why I lent 
my support to the leader of the party whose program we intended 
to implement together. In particular, during the 1991 
presidential elections we came third with him, in tandem with 
him and this was sensational. But the LDPR's program certainly 
fails to tally with Vladimir Volfovich current statements and 
that is why it is actually necessary to shed some light on this 
issue. 
  "That is to say that the program does not plan any pushes 
south, or any other direction, north, west or east. But in his 
book he does plan such pushes, going so far as to state that it 
would be no tragedy at all for a country like Turkey to vanish 
from the face of the Earth. These statements are very poor 
tactics, of course, and I am aware of my own personal guilt in 
the sense that this man has practically come to power and I am 
the main agent to have facilitated this and that is why I would 
like to take this opportunity to say that I am duty bound to 
apologize to the peoples and countries visited by Vladimir 
Volfovich where he was rude to their peoples and leaders". 
  Fatkudinov explains that the retaking of the Baltic states 
or 
the area of Alaska, as advocated by Zhirinovskiy, would entail 
rivers of blood, as was already once the case with Finland in 
1940. Zhirinovskiy's adventures might lead to a nuclear 
holocaust, says Fatkudinov. People in the post-imperial Russia 
are very sensitive to the perceived suffering of their fellow 
countrymen elsewhere, but these issues are to be resolved by 
diplomacy and not tanks. No one has yet been able to recreate 
their own former empire and the way forward is to try and find 
room for refugees as was done successfully in Germany after the 
Second World War, says Fatkudinov, stressing that this is the 
only way to avoid bloodshed. Torchinskiy regrets that this was 
not spelled out during the election campaign and Fatkudinov 
agrees. The government must facilitate this expected influx of 
refugees and Zhirinovskiy's statements merely exacerbate the 
position of the Russophone population outside Russia. 
  Asked by Torchinskiy about the LDPR's economic program, 
Zavidiya replies that it owes a great deal to former Prime 
Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, a personal friend. Torchinskiy jokes 
about Zavidiya's self-proclaimed communist views and his 
position as Chairman of the Galant company which has 1,500 
enterprises. Zavidiya goes on to say that the Galant company 
set up 3,500 organizing committees throughout the country and 
that they voted for him, rather than Zhirinovskiy who allegedly 
relegated his party list place from 
  Zavidiya says that his was "a decisive" contribution to the 
victory. "The point is -- and we have had conversations with 
him on this -- that generally speaking he senses that I am a 
more serious rival than he is himself at the future presidential 
elections in 1996." 
  Returning to the party's economic program, Zavidiya says 
that 
it revolves round the principle of mixed economy and the 
development of all forms of ownership. Fatkudinov derides 
Zhirinovskiy's reckless promises to improve the lot of all and 
sundry immediately. He finds particularly objectionable 
Zhirinovskiy's notions of fighting crime: Execute them on the 
spot. We've been there once, recalls Fatkudinov. Zavidiya adds 
that many people expected Zhirinovskiy to step down from his 
party chairmanship following the victory and to concentrate on 
being a deputy in the Duma. Torchinskiy then goes on to ask: 
"Many materials appear in the press to the effect that the 
appearance of the LDPR was provoked by the CPSU, the then CPSU 
leadership, of course and by the KGB." 
  Zavidiya replies: "I categorically disagree with this, for 
the simple reason that I first made my acquaintance with 
Vladimir Volfovich during the events marking the anniversary of 
the October Revolution on 6 November 1990. It was also there 
that I met Boris Nikolayevich. I personally gave my visiting 
card to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and to Vladimir Volfovich 
Zhirinovskiy, during the celebrations of the October Revolution 
anniversary in the Kremlin. Boris Nikolayevich did not 
telephone me, but Vladimir Volfovich did. We met and began to 
cooperate. The first thing he said was: Andrey Fedorovich, how 
can the program, already being printed, be paid for? I said it 
would have to be looked at. I mean he gave me, he showed me 
their program, I saw that it was a normal program pure and 
simple and paid for it -- 26,000 rubles all in all, I paid for 
the whole program. I also paid 10,000 for his posters -- 10,000 
for his posters and not a single kopeck more was handed over 
personally or otherwise. As for the election campaign in 
Russian, I paid for my travels with my own money." 
  Asked about other sources of financing, Zavidiya says: "I 
simply have no such information, but since he turned to me for 
such a trifle as 26,000 and 10,000 -- well, I do not know, if 
there were other sources of financing, surely he would not have 
turned to me for such trifles, but this is just what I think." 
  Asked about who defrayed Zhirinovskiy electoral expenses, 
Zavidiya says it was not his concern, for his organization 
worked for and voted for him and assured him that they did not 
share Zhirinovskiy's views. Fatkudinov concludes his 
contribution to the program by quoting the Criminal Code which 
makes propaganda of war a crime punishable by imprisonment of 
between three and eight years. Zavidiya doubts that many people 
share such extreme views. The task of electoral victory was 
accomplished, but between 50 to 60 percent of those who voted 
are his supporters, now leaving the party, says Zavidiya: "The 
LDPR bloc will collapse in the nearest future, you will see 
that". Asked for his forecast for the future, Zavidiya says 
that Zhirinovskiy will desperately push for presidential 
elections in 1994 -- his last chance. He hopes there will be no 
such elections. Asked whether he would take part in a live TV 
debate with Zhirinovskiy, Zavidiya says he would be delighted to 
do so, it would be his wildest dreams come true, and that he is 
ready for this at any time.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Kostikov: "Outlines of a `Clean </F>
Russia;' Law and Order Are Product of Mature Democracy and Legal 
and Everyday Standards, not Ideology"] 
  [Text] I remember that one of the most pleasant sensations 
of my childhood was the clatter of our yardwoman's broom. The 
windows of our old Moscow house looked out onto the streets and 
in the intervals between the thunder and squealing of the tram 
wheels turning the sharp corner at the church of Metropolitan 
Filipp, at number 2 Meshchanskaya Street, I could clearly hear 
this "whoosh," which I still remember, coming from the 
yardwoman's ancient broom. These sounds began at around 
0500-0600 hours, that is when it was still dark in the winter, 
but when early in the morning the Moscow working people or we 
primary school children emerged from our homes the sidewalks 
were "scraped clean" and swept and in the summer were washed 
with water from a black hosepipe and in winter after snowfalls 
neat piles of snow rose up at the roadsides and were later taken 
away into the yards in huge plywood crates with the most 
vigorous support from us small boys. 
  Today many people are inclined to idealize the order 
maintained on the streets and in the yards and doorways and to 
present it as a model of the "socialist way of life." Most of 
us probably remember how Moscow was ordered to be a model 
communist city and consequently the world's cleanest city. With 
the adroitness of communist propaganda and the vitality of 
Soviet myths this illusion of outward order fools many people. 
And there is nothing surprising in the fact that the party of 
the "communist broom" was very successful at the Federal 
Assembly elections. 
  The Communist Party and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party 
of 
Russia] as though in collusion both put forward the introduction 
of order as virtually their main election slogans while not, it 
is true, specifying how this would be achieved in reality: 
through rebukes from the "parteigenosse" at party meetings, 
with the aid of a radical GULAG or, even more radical, by means 
of a war against their own people, on which subject the leaders 
of the All-Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks-CPSU have 
nothing to learn from anyone: They surpassed everyone in 
practice, beginning with the suppression of the Kronshtadt and 
Tambov uprisings. Here the communist and national-socialist 
agitators "forget" to tell the population that order, legality, 
and cleanliness have existed in the majority of European cities 
for several centuries. That is, long before Lenin, Stalin, and 
Hitler tried to grace Russia and Germany with the theory and 
practice of social and racial cleansing. 
  Law and order are the product of mature democracy and legal 
and everyday standards, not ideology. 
  How to explain the popularity of slogans of order for Russia 
or the interest displayed by the public in the idea of a "clean 
Russia," if we are speaking of its more workaday transformation? 
  Probably by the fact that alongside civil rights, rights to 
education, medical services, freedom of religion, and others 
there is, without being described in law, citizens' right to 
order. If you talk of simple and clear elements in the people's 
life then the concepts of democracy and freedom as reflected in 
daily life are implemented through the order, calm, and 
cleanliness of urban and rural life. Cleanliness and order in 
the country begin with cleanliness in your own doorway, on your 
own threshold. 
  It is only in our politically unsettled times that we have 
to go to the polling stations several times a year. In 
countries with a stable democracy such an expensive "pleasure" 
is permitted only once every several years. It is we, concerned 
with repelling the ideologists and leaders of the 
communo-fascists, who are prepared to go to the barricades or 
meetings at the first call to defend our fragile democracy. In 
old Europe meetings and demonstrations take place with the 
strict observance of established regulations and under police 
guard. In our country abuse and obscenities against the 
president and government are considered virtually to be in good 
taste for the newspapers which flaunt their new independence. A 
real democratic press knows how to say unpleasant things and 
even to cut into the flesh with the expertise of a skilled 
surgeon. During Watergate Richard Nixon was brought to 
political death not by the newspapers' unbridled statements but 
by professional journalists' painstaking work. 
  In a healthy society politics and the population do not 
notice each other, in the good sense of the word. The assembly 
bell should ring in exceptional cases and only when the people 
do indeed need to be pushed to accomplish something 
extraordinary. 
  One of the underlying reasons for the democrats' failure at 
the elections is the fact that neither the parties nor their 
leaders have the stomach or the ability to perform routine work 
for the sake of the genuine values of the state and the people. 
The aim of the election campaign was not to put forward ideas 
which could normalize Russia but to obtain deputies' seats and 
to win a successful percentage. Not a single one of the 
election blocs' programs essentially even mentioned how 
nationwide problems, as opposed to narrow party or group 
problems, would be resolved. The Agrarian Party of Russia quite 
frankly preached the conservation of the collective and state 
farm system in the interests of "soviet landowners" -- the 
directors and chairmen of the state and collective farms. The 
"Civic Union" interpreted the interests of the "red directors." 
"Women of Russia" introduced its own "feminine" note to the 
chorus of demands made on the government. The communist party, 
having repealed the dictatorship of the proletariat for reasons 
of expediency, traded wholesale and retail in the specters of an 
equalizing social happiness. 
  The very concept of the "social state" stuck in the new 
Constitution sounds like the echo of communist ideology and 
essentially reflects the same party division in the face of the 
general and indivisible interests of all Russia and the entire 
people. It is merely through the inertia of Soviet thinking 
that it preserves the illusion of the possibility of preserving 
social peace by issuing unbacked loaves. 
  Yet the lack of uniting national-strategic political 
parameters that are clear to the people is extremely dangerous. 
The Federal Assembly, recruited on the basis of the party and 
leader [vozhdevoy] principle, by virtue of this face alone is 
already programed for political and personal disputes. It is 
hard to believe that, counter to the Russians' hopes, it will be 
able to given an account of itself as the expresser and defender 
of the people's life. Russia's national, underlying interests 
could again be beyond the Federal Assembly's purview. 
  It could happen that a truly broad movement of the 
population 
for national normalization will be formed around a 
nonparliamentary figure and outside the Federal Assembly walls. 
Examples of such phenomena are known to history. There has 
been Gandhi and Gandhism in India, Tolstoy and Tolstoyism in 
Russia, and the movement around Martin Luther King in the United 
States. There is the O. Palme phenomenon in the Scandinavian 
countries. A. Sakharov could have been such a figure in our 
country were it not for his untimely end. 
  Without underestimating the country's economic difficulties 
I 
should like to express the opinion that the main barrier 
complicating Russia's emergence onto a strategic expanse is the 
lack of a clearly formulated national goal brought to the 
awareness of every family and citizen. The absence of, if you 
like, a "Russian idea," a Russian goal and dream. And it is 
obvious that this aim is outside short-term politics and even 
outside the economy. 
  One reason for the democrats' defeat at the elections was 
that masses of the population did not want to identify 
themselves with any of the democratic parties or with any bloc. 
And it is not that the leaders or promises were bad but because 
not a single party was able to clearly disclose a uniting 
strategy. 
  Our new politicians argue intelligently about a collective 
approach [sobornost] and its benefits to the Russian man and 
state. They forget that for the overwhelming majority of 
peasants, workers, and housewives whom they want to tempt with a 
collective approach and great powerdom these words sound as 
absurd and incomprehensible as "Snickers" or the "Maastricht 
Treaty." 
  A person will understand that matters in our country have 
finally turned toward order not because he is given a correct 
explanation of how and why the White House was burned down and 
why a trial was needed of the State Committee for the State of 
Emergency and totalitarian ideology but only if his wife, 
daughter, and grandchildren are no longer afraid to leave the 
house after dark. Millions of people who suffered from the 
tyranny of the CPSU will only believe that the suppressed 
rebellion has saved us from the threat of a communist 
restoration if the lovers of red-brown sauce, sickles, hammers, 
and swastikas are firmly and clearly shown their place in 
society. 
  But if in our country punch-ups, drunkenness, car thefts, 
and 
fighting between racketeers continue on the streets even after 
the October events, if a month after the rebellion's leaders 
entered Lefortovo their lawyers are beginning shamelessly to 
demand that the president stand trial, if several weeks after 
the president's supporters were almost hanged on the Kremlin 
trees, the inflammatory newspaper DEN is again starting to be 
sold in Moscow, if after all that we learned of the National 
Salvation Front and of Anpilov and Anpilov's supporters and they 
have the impudence to apply to picket the new parliament... then 
that person, whom they want to lead by collective and 
great-power means toward democracy with a Russian face may quite 
justifiably send the democrats and democracy packing and demand 
a real dictator. Which in part is what happened 12 December. 
  The new parliament will probably be able to become a testing 
ground for running in and calibrating statesmen. For all the 
shortcomings already discerned in it, that will be its useful 
mission. Here they must not only be clearly aware that 
politicians' personal accounts far from always coincide with the 
nation's aspirations. Being a politician is always a profession 
with all its transient, often pleasant but, alas, short-lived 
attributes and gifts. 
  In connection with the possibility of the Federal Assembly's 
"self-disillusionment" in the very first months of its work, 
particular importance attaches to the Constitution which has 
been adopted. The development of the Constitution is of 
strategic importance to Russia. It reveals the democratic 
future of a single and indivisible Russia as the aim of national 
policy. In other words, for the first time in our state's 
history a general national uniting task has been set before 
Russia's people. 
  But the new Constitution, with enormous internal creative 
energy, is nonetheless a sleeping Ilya Muromets. This hero 
still has to be awoken and taught to walk and act. It would be 
naive to suppose that after 12 December there will be a miracle 
of Russian transformation. The great American constitution was 
adopted 200 years ago yet the American economic boom began only 
after World War II and without any direct link with the 
constitution. The constitution is only a "great promise." 
  And perhaps the most important thing which we must all 
understand is that the new Russian Constitution is not the 
truth, it is a path. 
  With the coordinated collaboration of the state and the 
democratic parties that path can be shortened. But only the 
united people themselves can plow the deep furrow of their own 
fate and implement it on the basis of the ideals of the 
Constitution. 
  I have already written about the idea of the "Clean Russia" 
movement. About the extra-party people's movement which would 
be based on Russia's nationwide aims. Of course it is not a 
case of revising the democratic idea of pluralism. The parties 
in a democratic society perform an essential role, ensuring the 
generation of competing ideas and the necessary level of 
critical control over the activity of the government, president, 
and other parties. But the actual principle of party-mindedness 
contains the idea of people's division on the basis of their 
interests: class, professional, corporate, social, and property 
interests. In addition the party is always a vehicle for moving 
toward power. And whether the leaders of the parties want it or 
not, even the most sincere of them are obliged, especially under 
crisis conditions, to subordinate their actions to the 
imperatives of the struggle for political survival. National 
aims proclaimed in the party programs are most often camouflage 
for the road leading not to the temple but to power. 
  The "Clean Russia" movement would not set itself power 
goals. It does not need deputies' seats or government posts. 
Its strength would lie in the moral solidarity of the entire 
population around a few goals determining the health of the 
nation and the unity of the country. The instrument of the 
"Clean Russia" movement would be not violence but the voluntary 
donation of a small part of one's labor, a modest contribution, 
physical or moral participation. It would not be a movement of 
likeminded people. But people adhering to different views could 
unite for joint actions for Russia's benefit. I could cite as 
an example one of these nationwide goals. 
  The collapse of the USSR generated major migration 
movements. 
The Russian-speaking population is flowing out of nearly all the 
former USSR republics. In each specific case, for each family 
obliged to move away from their home and go out into the unknown 
it is a drama, often a tragedy. 
  Of course, one can see this problem in a political and 
propaganda focus. One can demand sanctions against the states 
which expel the Russians. One can push the Russians to resist. 
One can ultimately achieve certain concessions through the use 
of certain means. In the short term this policy and these 
tactics can bring short-term dividends for a party or leader who 
has declared himself the defender of the oppressed. But as a 
result of reciprocal national violence there can arise such a 
complex knot of contradictions and hatred that it cannot be 
unravelled without bloodshed. 
  There is another path. A nationwide program, based on 
all-Russian solidarity, for the Russians' return, to draw them 
inside Russian borders. We have tens and hundreds of cities and 
villages which were once declared "unpromising" and escheated. 
Yet Russian people lived for centuries in these cities and 
villages. They lived and worked, augmenting the country's 
wealth. Today these lands lie empty and the cities are going to 
ruin, degenerating demographically. 
  Russia has spent too generously on "developing" adjacent 
lands, exerting itself immoderately, tearing its own umbilical 
cord. Dozens of cities, plants, factories, and airfields 
constructed by the genius of the Russian mind and the skill of 
Russian hands, when union property was shared out made us the 
hostages of alien intentions, the victims of national 
improvidence. We are already being blackmailed with the 
technological and cultural munificence we ourselves bestowed. 
Russia gave primers to many peoples who did not even have their 
own written language and now they are trying to teach us, the 
heirs of Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevskiy, they are trying to 
teach us "human rights" on the basis of these primers. 
  Russia does not need other people's resources. But we must 
distribute our own resources in the manner which is customary in 
a healthy family: first to our own children, elderly parents, 
and our own orphans, and then (if the granaries are not empty) 
to close and remote neighbors. 
  The "Clean Russia" ideas are based not on racism but on a 
normal and healthy feeling of national egotism. Someone who 
does not know how to provide a sufficiency in his own home is 
useless to his neighbors. We must equip and sweep clean our own 
house and only then speak of the concepts of humanism for all 
mankind. 
  Here the Russian people, the Russians must pose least of all 
in the guise of some kind of ideal and model and least of all 
surrender to the messianic temptations of the "third Rome" 
ideology. We have no grounds for this. We must simply reach 
the level of other peoples who have learned to live normal human 
lives under the conditions of democracy. 
  For this discipline is needed. The discipline of the nation 
and of each person. We must rid ourselves of laxity in work and 
daily life. We must introduce normal models of labor discipline 
and conduct into society. So that it is clear to everyone where 
the permissible limit of "naughtiness" ends and where 
hooliganism begins, where there is normal festive drinking and 
where it turns into drunkenness, boorishness, and lack of labor 
discipline. Today these borderlines are eroded in our country. 
In our country people can ridicule a teetotaller, a man who 
speaks in a literary Russian language, an educated man, and 
softheartedly take pity on a drunkard and idler known to 
everyone in the apartment block. A dangerous distortion of the 
concepts of good and bad has occurred in society. A 
foul-mouthed idler drinking with the foreman at the plant in our 
country often passes as a "great guy." An overt criminal passes 
for a resourceful businessman. We have become accustomed to the 
shameful filth of our doorways, muck on the streets, and 
bureaucrats' bribe-taking and arrogance. We have gotten out of 
the habit of walking normally and dressing normally. Often not 
even because of poverty but because of the primitive nature of 
our taste and education. 
  And at the same time these are Russian citizens or ethnic 
Russians [russkiye ili rossiyanye]. The task of the "Clean 
Russia" movement is to return to them their human dignity or at 
least not to allow them to defile the lives of their own 
children. 
  We do not need much money for that. 
  We need powerful and coordinated work by all the mass media 
interested in the country's upsurge. 
  I do not remember whose idea it was that to encourage a 
people to rise up they must be aware of the degree to which they 
have fallen. In my opinion we are close to that. Today many 
people in our country are speaking and writing about patriotism. 
The false monopoly of the Communists and national socialists on 
love for the Fatherland is being broken. Democratic writers and 
journalists are speaking seriously and profoundly about 
patriotism. Patriotic impulses are emanating from the Russian 
president. 
  But today it is important to take the next step. To switch 
from agitation and competition in patriotism to action. It is 
important to transfer the concept and expression of patriotism 
to the plane of routine, daily life. It is not every day and 
every year (fortunately) that society requires lofty sacrificial 
patriotism, examples of which were given to us by the Great 
Patriotic War. Patriotism and love for the Fatherland in 
everyday life can most often be displayed in the unremarkable 
actions about which no one will write in the newspapers. 
  If instead of being in the habit of cursing the Moscow city 
hall for badly cleaned streets several apartment block residents 
were to go out onto their own doorway with brooms and shovels 
after a heavy snowfall that would be a small step toward a 
"Clean Russia" (someone would probably ridicule it to start 
with). If in a small provincial city a few intellectual and 
educated people were to organize lectures on linguistic 
standards that would be a small exploit in the name of Russian 
culture. If through our collective protests (not political 
protests, with no banners or raised fists, but through peaceful 
civic means) we were to get television to observe a ban on the 
advertising of alcohol and tobacco, that would mean that the 
"Clean Russia" movement had begun to exist in reality. If 
together with the church we were to ensure that it is not the 
funeral mafia which runs the cemeteries but that normal, honest 
people work there, that would be a small step toward returning 
the nation's dignity. 
  "Clean Russia" is not a fantasy, not mythmaking. It is a 
feasible reality precisely because it calls people not to 
exploits, not to sacrifice, but to the display of humaneness and 
discipline in the simplest circumstances of daily life. If 
there are millions of us, Russia will be transformed.

  [Text] Sergey Glazyev, former Russian minister of foreign 
economic relations, has denied assertions that economic 
stabilization has begun in Russia. 
  The "chaotic disintegration" of the economy may continue for 
a long time to come, he told a conference in Moscow on Monday 
[10 January]. 
  Glazyev listed what, in his view, are the essential measures 
to stabilize the economy. The main step is to restore the 
controlled public sector, namely a network of state-owned 
enterprises, he said. 
  Another important measure is stimulation of "vertical 
reintegration" and creation of "large vertical corporations." 
The restrictions on the merger of enterprises and the 
absorption of one enterprise by another must be lifted, Glazyev 
believes. Creation of corporations -- state, private and mixed 
ones alike -- should be encouraged, he said. "One of the main 
destabilizing factors" in the economy is the implementation of 
the government program of privatization, which "is leading to 
the severing of economic links," he said. 
  State control of natural resources should be restored, for 
that could also play an important stabilizing role, Glazyev 
believes. No less important, in his opinion, would be tight 
control over the use by enterprises of the funds they receive 
for the maintenance and renovation of their equipment. Today 
such money is often spent on wages, he said. 
  In general, it is efficient microeconomic ties that would 
provide the basis for stabilization, Glazyev said. "We do not 
reject macroeconomic stabilization, but we believe it is 
insufficient," he said.

  [Text] Russia's economic performance in 1993 has proved 
much less impressive than the government's economic forecast 
made at the end of 1992. 
  The gross domestic product diminished by 12 percent, and, 
compared to 1991, by 29 percent. 
  Experts of the independent research center Macroecon-Link 
note in this connection that in October 1992 the Economics 
Ministry predicted a 5-8 percent decrease. The rate of the 
reduction of Russia's gross domestic product has outstripped the 
same index in the U.S. during the great depression (38 percent 
compared to 30 percent in the U.S. from 1930 to 1933). 
  In 1993, the volume of industrial production dropped by 16 
percent, which is slightly down from the 1992 index of 18 
percent. 
  The aggregate price index grew 10 times (in 1992 - 26 
times), 
while the average salary increased 8 times. 
  Last year, Russia manufactured 6 percent less electric 
energy 
than in 1992, 12 percent less oil, 4 percent less gas and 10 
percent less coal. 
  The production of steel dropped by 13 percent, tractors - 35 
percent, harvesters - 43 percent, cement - 18 percent, fabrics - 
26 percent, meat - 14 percent, milk - 17 percent and sugar - 5 
percent. The crop of grain amounted to 99 Mn tons compared to 
107 Mn tons in 1992. 
  Manufacture of refrigerators increased by 10 percent, TV 
sets 
by 9 percent and vegetable oil by 14 percent. 
  Russia's foreign trade turnover amounted to $76 Bn. The 
exports grew by 13 percent to $ 45.9 Bn, including the export of 
oil by 21 percent, gas - 3 percent and timber - 3 percent. 
  The value of Russia's imports was over $30 Bn, which is 15 
percent less than in 1992. Grain imports did not exceed 11 Mn 
tons, which is 62 percent less than in 1992.
