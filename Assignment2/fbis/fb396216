<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report under the "Results" rubric with the </F>
general headline: "Ruble Falls Following Gaydar. Yeltsin Proved 
To Have Not Been Ready for Gaydar's, Fedorov's Resignations, 
Although Both Could Have Easily Been Predicted"] 
  [Text] Now that Boris Fedorov has left the Russian Cabinet 
of Ministers, the only ideological figure still in the 
government is Anatoliy Chubays. His fate is unlikely to be 
subject to change before check privatization is completed next 
summer. 
  Both Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov managed to leave the 
government nearly gracefully. This should not be misunderstood, 
though: Yegor Gaydar made a wrong move last September, and 
Boris Fedorov, an ideologist of pragmatism in economic policy 
turned "stubborn" monetarist, proved unable to tackle inflation. 
Moreover, the excessive strengthening of the ruble, which has 
undermined the domestic industry's export capacities, does him 
no credit either. This factor could be an example for the former 
minister's address in an American university on the occasion of 
the complete and final defeat of inflation in Russia, but at 
this stage it makes almost no sense at all. 
  Boris Fedorov's political clout, which was heavily 
undermined 
in the provinces (by delayed wages and nonpayments for 
production delivered under state orders), will apparently be 
boosted by the significant fall of the ruble's exchange rate. 
This fall, however, should not be perceived as a clear sign of 
Russia's "Ukrainization." Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out 
that after Gaydar's resignation was accepted, the Finance 
Ministry was interested in having the ruble follow the reformer. 
  Unfortunately, according to the pendulum theory, the 
government is indeed doomed to a certain increase in 
expenditures once a less prominent bureaucrat takes Fedorov's 
place. 
  What is curious is that Boris Fedorov, like Yegor Gaydar, 
did 
not have an actual reason for resigning, so he presented an 
ultimatum that could not be fulfilled and even went from a 
relatively strong faction, "Russia's Choice" (whose 
representative could expect to become a government member 
following Gaydar's departure at least as a compensation), to a 
relatively weak one, as if he were deliberately trying to make 
sure that his terms would not be taken seriously.

  [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- Russian economist Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy said on Wednesday he would agree to head a government 
"oriented to overcome an economic crisis" which he predicted 
would occur in March. 
  Yavlinskiy told reporters that in his government current 
Finance Minister Boris Fedorov would chair the Central Bank, 
while Anatoliy Chubays would remain the privatisation supremo. 
  The leader of the Yabloko parliamentary faction said he had 
not received any offers to join the government of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, but had there been any he would have "submitted a 
programme of extreme anti-crisis measures in three weeks". 
  However, Yavlinskiy added that he would assume the 
responsibility "only on condition that the president exerts no 
pressure and does not interfere". 
  Yavlinskiy believes that First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar 
had resigned because of the economic situation which had sharply 
aggravated of late.

  [Text] Moscow, 19 Jan -- Sergey Shakhray, who is a member 
of the State Duma, told journalists during a break in today's 
session of the lower house that he will probably agree to head 
the Ministry of Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy. This 
is because he feels that 1994 will be quite a difficult year as 
far as interethnic relations are concerned. He voiced 
confidence that he would be able "to at least minimize" the 
consequences of interethnic conflicts and help resolve them. 
  Sergey Shakhray expressed the wish that, even if he does 
lose 
the post of deputy prime minister, he should at least be able to 
have direct access to the prime minister and deputy prime 
minister. 
  Asked by an ITAR-TASS correspondent about the prospects for 
his joining the new government, Deputy Aleksandr Shokhin said: 
"I cannot tell you anything new. I have not yet decided. The 
number of offers I am getting is increasing."

  [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- Arkadiy Volskiy, the 
president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, turned down the offer to join the government 
which was, evidently, made to him by First Deputy Prime Minister 
Oleg Soskovets who attended the Tuesday meeting of Volskiy's 
union. 
  "I am repeating for the 37th time that I will not work in 
this government", Volskiy told TASS on Wednesday. He did not 
deny the fact that he had received the offer. 
  Volskiy's election bloc, the "Civic Union", lost the last 
parliamentary election completely which proved that directors of 
state enterprises which it united have no social support because 
of the failure to ensure the minimum subsistance level to their 
workers and to pay wages in time. 
  However, it is clear that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and his First Deputy Oleg Soskovets want to rely on heads of 
state run enterprises and farms in their future work. This 
explains the offer to Volsky and a resolute support to Deputy 
Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha who protects the interests 
of collective and state farms. 
  President Boris Yeltsin, who has accepted the resignation of 
Yegor Gaydar, the major reformer in the government, now insists 
on keeping another reformer, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, in 
the government. This caused a major disagreement with the prime 
minister, as Fedorov insists that Zaveryukha be dismissed. 
  The decision on the final government composition is thus 
delayed. The presidential press service announced on Wednesday 
that consultations will continue today and in the coming days.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays by </F>
commentator Nikolay Svanidze; place not given; from the 
"Details" program -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Svanidze] [passage omitted] After heavy 
rearguard fighting in the form of desperate attempts to issue 
ultimata to the government, the Gaydar team has retreated into 
the State Duma, and its retreat not been very organized. The 
personal mutual understanding between Yegor Gaydar and Boris 
Fedorov has clearly broken down, and taking account of the major 
tactical disagreements between Gaydar and Gennadiy Burbulis, 
this points to a serious split within Russia's Choice. 
  It was natural and inevitable that political relations would 
have to be clarified after the blow of the 12 December election 
results. Russia's Choice is now becoming what amounts to a 
constructive opposition to the government, and is entering new 
and very complex relations with the president. A key role will 
be played in Viktor Chernomyrdin's new government by 
professionals with centrist views, close to directors' circles. 
In a new spiral, and in different conditions, a government of 
experienced managers is being set up which is ideologically 
related in many ways to the Ryzhkov-Abalkin cabinet. 
  Only one person is left in the government today from the 
government of the first Yegor Gaydar cabinet of two years ago -- 
Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State 
Committee for the Management of State Property. 
  Anatoliy Borisovich, you have found yourself in proud and 
romantic isolation, alone among strangers. What will you do in 
a government without Gaydar and Fedorov? 
  [Chubays] Well, first of all the decision on Fedorov has not 
yet been adopted, so I would not draw such unequivocal 
conclusions, let us wait a little. Second, I do not entirely 
agree that Chubays has been left alone in the government, it 
must be said that I have been working with these people for more 
than a year now. Relations have certainly not always been 
simple, and there are serious difficulties as well, but 
nevertheless there has been real work on privatization with 
these people in this government, and everything that has been 
done on privatization has been done in this line-up. So we have 
experience of work in a friendly environment, a not entirely 
friendly environment, and an entirely unfriendly environment. 
  [Svanidze] How is the environment now? 
  [Chubays] I am ready to answer that question as soon as the 
new government line-up is announced. 
  [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, do you see yourself now more 
as deputy prime minister or as a member of the Russia's Choice 
bloc? 
  [Chubays] Both, to an identical degree. Furthermore, I think 
it is important that Gaydar's actions too -- I think it has not 
yet been fully understood, but they must be regarded not as the 
actions of Yegor Gaydar personally but as the actions of the 
leader of a major political bloc. I remind you, by the way, 
that today Russia's Choice has the most seats in the State Duma, 
significantly more than either Zhirinovskiy or the Interregional 
group. Gaydar as an individual perhaps might have followed some 
other line, but as leader of the bloc, he is acting as a leader 
should act. 
  [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin is a firm man. How do you find working with him? 
  [Chubays] I don't think it would be proper for me to assess 
my own actions, but I have worked and work in the government 
only as long as I follow the line which I consider to be the 
right one, which I can answer for. That means that I have 
followed that line until today, and it is that line which I can 
answer for. 
  [Svanidze] So the character of the leadership does not worry 
you in this instance? 
  [Chubays] No, why do you say that? The character of the 
leadership is very important for me, and I think that the 
premier of the government has to be a firm man, that is his 
duty. Otherwise there is nothing underpinning you, otherwise it 
is simply impossible to work. 
  [Svanidze] In that respect Viktor Stepanovich's personal 
qualities suit you? 
  [Chubays] From the point of view of the firmness of his 
character, undoubtedly. 
  [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, we have a triangle here: 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and his government, President Boris 
Nikolayevich Yeltsin, and the reformist party bloc. Which of 
them do you plan to be guided by the most? 
  [Chubays] Things have worked out in such a way that the job 
I 
do would be impossible without the president's personal support. 
It would be impossible without the personal support of Gaydar, 
and everything Gaydar did back in the first government from 
1990. It would be impossible without the present government as 
well. Relations have been quite complex within the government, 
but in spite of that, the line has been maintained, and I remind 
you that my version of the privatization program was adopted at 
a session of the government a month ago. Therefore it is, if 
you like, the work of several authors -- the president, the 
government, and the Russia's Choice bloc, probably to varying 
degrees. 
  [Svanidze] You are answering about your work, but I am 
asking 
about you, whom do you as a politician intend to follow? After 
all, the president, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and the 
reformers, let us say in Russia's Choice, do not occupy the same 
positions on all issues. 
  [Chubays] I intend to follow the fulfillment of those 
duties which I personally as a member of the government took on 
before the people when I began the issue of privatization checks 
on 1 October 1992, and I am compelled to discharge these duties 
in full, all the more so as our program is fully supported by 
Russia's Choice, and in the Russia's Choice program there is a 
whole section on privatization, which I wrote myself. 
  [Svanidze] What stance do you think the president should now 
be adopting: father of the nation, the supreme arbitrator, or a 
person persistently following a definite line? 
  [Chubays] Undoubtedly the president is unable to choose some 
kind of black or white position for himself. So it is a 
question not of either one or the other, but of finding 
correlations between degrees or measures. I am convinced that 
the president will remain president as long as he remains the 
guarantor of reform in Russia. 
  [Svanidze] But for how long will he be the guarantor of 
reform in Russia, if we are talking about Yeltsin? At the 
moment it is a question of whether he should weigh up all 
positions, like the statue personifying justice, or whether he 
should have political preferences of some kind. 
  [Chubays] He must undoubtedly have political preferences and 
be guided by the reforms, but at the same time, he must of 
course weigh up the balance of political forces. 
  [Svanidze] But he must demonstrate preferences? 
  [Chubays] I think so. 
  [Svanidze] Thank you. I remind you that you were watching 
Anatoliy Borisovich Chubays live on Russian television on the 
"Details" program. Goodbye.

  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- Russian Vice Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said on Tuesday it is unlikely that 
the government will sharply change its line, if its core remains 
intact. 
  At the same time, he admitted that it would be hard to 
resist 
the pressure from the industrial and regional lobby especially 
after the inflation spiral was wound tightly in the last four 
months. Now it is beginning to unwind, forcing the government 
to pay off the debts which were not paid in November-December, 
Shokhin said. 
  Even if former First Vice Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar 
decided 
to stay in the government, this process would continue anyway, 
he said. It is hard to imagine that under Gaydar inflation would 
be smaller in January-February than in December, Shokhin said.

  [Text] Chairman of the All-Russia Union "Renewal" Aleksandr 
Vladislavlev believes that in principle Yegor Gaydar made the 
right choice. He noted, however, that Gaydar had explained his 
move by "wrong reasons." He told Interfax that Gaydar's real 
problem was disagreements with the people, not with the Cabinet 
members. 
  "The people had their say during the election and the 
president heeded the people's voice," said Vladislavlev. As the 
only guarantor of social stability and further reforms, the 
president must propose a more reasonable and acceptable rate of 
reforms," he said. 
  The withdrawal of an "architect who built the future of the 
country on the sand of naive beliefs will make it possible to 
put the reforms on a more stable footing," he continued. He is 
also convinced that the president and the prime minister will 
carry out the reforms in the interests of the state and the 
people. 
  Vladislavlev favors the idea of forming up a new team of 
realistic-minded reformers capable of leading the country out of 
the crisis.

  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- The resignation of First 
Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar means that communists and other 
opposition blocs will now cooperate with the government of 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, according to Sergey Baburin, the leader of 
the hard-line "Russian Path" parliamentary group and a staunch 
opponent of President Boris Yeltsin. 
  "I believe the resignation of Yegor Gaydar signals the end 
of 
the transfer of the (pro-Yeltsin) Russia's Choice bloc into 
opposition", Baburin told TASS on Tuesday. 
  Now the communists and other opposition factions in 
parliament will "take under patronage Chernomyrdin and his 
government", he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, January 19 (TASS) -- Arkadiy Volskiy, 
president of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, 
whose Civic Union Bloc lost parliamentary elections completely, 
accused Yegor Gaydar, the architect of Russian reforms, of 
trying to escape responsibility for the failure of reforms. 
  The resignation of Gaydar "is an attempt to avoid 
responsibility for failures in economic reforms and a desire to 
put the burden on the shouldres of those people who could not 
allow themseleves the luxury to abandon the leadership in the 
difficult moment", Volskiy told a meeting of regional leaders of 
his union on Tuesday. 
  He also said that the December 12 elections had shown that 
the Russian people "do not accept unreasoned experiments in 
politics and economy". 
  According to Volskiy, Russia now faces two alternatives: 
whether to join industrially developed nations or remain their 
raw materials appendage with cheap resources and skilled 
manpower. 
  First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets addressed the 
meeting and said he would "strengthen constructive cooperation" 
with the union."

  [Text] Gaydar's resignation, and even a possible walk out 
of other "shock therapy symbols," will not change anything since 
the government does not have a clearly-defined line of 
development. That was declared in an interview with INTERFAX by 
Mikhail Gorbachev, the ex-Soviet president. 
  In his opinion, no one in the government is thinking about 
what should be done next to advance the country, and for this 
reason "we are doomed to political and economic drifting with 
all the ensuing consequences." 
  He warned that if the country's leaders "disregarded the 
popular mood, Russia would surely get into new serious political 
troubles with adverse social effects." 
  However, he spoke out against returning the country to the 
old system. In his words, the course towards a market economy 
should be continued but substantially corrected. 
  He suggested for one that market relations should be 
intensified at the small and medium business level and urged 
passing tough anti-monopoly legislation. 
  "But there is nothing more important than to teach people 
how 
to live under market conditions, otherwise transition to a 
market economy will be violent," Gorbachev stressed.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Bekker article under the "Prospects" rubric: "A </F>
Purely Soviet Government. Strong Economic Managers Getting Their 
Way in Council of Ministers"] 
  [Text] Yegor Gaydar did the last thing he could for 
President Yeltsin: He announced his resignation when Bill 
Clinton's plane was approaching the United States. Whereas for 
Boris Fedorov, Gaydar's economic policy and parliamentary bloc 
comrade-in-arms, his decision came as a "total surprise," Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, according to his secretary, had been ready -- 
meaning that the prime minister had well realized where his 
actions were leading. As of November, Gaydar had been virtually 
barred from making decisions on the republic's budget on 
instructions of the head of the government. On 10 November, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin issued personal instructions transferring 
export quota responsibility to Oleg Soskovets; he himself 
completely took over the sharing out of centralized credits. 
All these were indications that the Council of Ministers was 
going back to the Soviet style of work. 
  As early as the end of last year, several decisions were 
made 
which were clearly not backed by the budget's resources: 
subsidies for a number of economic sectors, and the indexation 
of minimum wages and pensions by 1.9 times. To the rejoicing of 
officials in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the 
sphere of export licensing has been widened; meanwhile, the 
dragging of Tajikistan and Belarus into the ruble zone spells a 
serious threat of price hikes in Russia. Thus, even the 
presence of Gaydar and Fedorov did not prove a serious 
constraint for the prime minister lately: He has achieved 
control of the cabinet of which he is in charge. An attempt to 
do the same on the scale of the Russian economy is seen as less 
than productive. 
  Even assuming that Fedorov stays "on the promise" to fight 
inflation by all means, his good intentions would soon be swept 
away by the wave of demands from the agro-industrial lobby, 
while he would become a decorative symbol of reforms. The 
finance minister cannot but realize that, hence he would hardly 
agree to the role of scapegoat. Without him the government's 
Credit Commission, which in one way or another somehow filtered 
the thousands of requests for centralized credits from regions, 
sectors, and enterprises, would soon die. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin cannot be thought as totally ignoring 
the 
danger of inflation. Ukraine's example has long been for him a 
warning sign. And he would not have dared to oust monetarists 
from the government without having some idea, or program, in his 
name. He has such a program today, and he is quite enthusiastic 
about it. This is the concept of selective support for key 
enterprises of the national economy. Elaborated by Professor 
Yasin, it would not have drawn any objections from Gaydar, 
Chubays, or Fedorov had it contained reliable mechanisms to 
implement it. They are extremely weak at the moment. As a 
result of selective financing for the "points of growth," the 
thread of inflation will be stripped. 
  It is good in a sense that "strong economic managers," 
"pragmatists," will work in Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet of 
ministers in an undiluted form. The purity of the experiment, 
as they say, is guaranteed. One unpleasant thing is, they are 
going to experiment with a living country. 
  It is historically clear what hyperinflation ends in for a 
country. The more so because the old-new communists and the 
president's "best friend" who once a month "plays chess with 
him" are already vibrating with impatience.

<F P=106> [Editorial office report: "Industrialists and Agrarians Do </F>
Not Lend Any Special Significance to Gaydar's Departure"] 
  [Text] Yesterday we published the viewpoint of a number of 
financiers about Yegor Gaydar's resignation from the post of 
government first vice premier. Chiefs of banks, exchanges, and 
investment companies are sorry about this decision, and they are 
concerned about the upcoming changes. Other IZVESTIYA readers 
express a rather different point of view. We considered it 
possible to acquaint you with their stance too. 
  Aleksandr Vladislavlev, vice president of the Russian Union 
of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs: 
  "Yegor Gaydar has theoretically made the right choice by 
leaving the government, but he gave the wrong reasons for his 
step. His problem is not a difference of opinion with other 
government members, but a difference of opinion with the people. 
It is a good thing if both he and his supporters understand 
this now. 
  "The president, it seems to me, cannot fail to take into 
consideration the undoubted fact that today the `ruling party,' 
so to speak, associated with Gaydar's team is a source of public 
allergy. This team has made reforming the economy its own 
exclusive right. 
  "Now it appears that this team is prepared to shed 
responsibility, transferring it to those who have tried to 
display common sense and avoid national disillusionment in the 
reforms. The departure of the `architect' who built the 
country's future on the sand of naive ideas gives us a chance to 
place the reforms on a more solid foundation." 
  Viktor Gulov, chairman of the "Kuzminichi" joint stock 
company in Kaluga Oblast: 
  "Any changes in the government are painful to those of us 
who 
are involved in agricultural production. Because amid the 
half-market economy we are nevertheless forced to be involved in 
finding our way, blazing a trail, and so on. The newly reformed 
farms (the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes) have their own 
specific development programs. But their implementation depends 
entirely on various government officials. Gaydar promised the 
agrarians a great deal at the end of last year. It will be 
disappointing if, with Yegor Timurovich's departure, his 
promises are forgotten. 
  "In principle this is not even about Gaydar. Before and 
during his time, attention paid to the agricultural producer has 
always been all talk, and unfortunately it will be the same 
after his time. Exorbitant credits, debts which the state is 
not paying off, the daunting prices of industrial goods. Was 
Gaydar able to change this situation? No. 
  "And anyway it is not Gaydar who is giving us a headache. He 
will not disappear... But the spring sowing is just around the 
corner. We need to have plenty of fuel and seed, we need 
equipment to be repaired... I am sorry, but `Gaydars' come and 
go, whereas the grain has to be sown every year. Under any 
government."

<F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel article: "Money Market Responds to Chief </F>
Monetarist's Departure With Panic"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It is obvious that the 
personnel changes in the government are the reason for the 
current panic in the money market. What has had most effect 
here is the voluntary resignation of Yegor Gaydar, who has 
personified the policy of tough financial stabilization. In 
this situation banks and other money market players have started 
actively buying up currency, simultaneously stretching the 
deadlines for the compulsory sale of 50 percent of their 
currency earnings in the hope of making a huge amount of money 
from an increase in the dollar rate. There is information that 
considerable resources are now also being transferred from the 
short-term state bond market to the currency market. 
  It is important to note another aspect. Since the beginning 
of the year nine auctions have already taken place at the Moscow 
exchange, at which over $1 billion has been sold. Around 1.5 
trillion rubles was needed in order to pay for it. The latter 
figure throws doubt on the argument of advocates of state 
support for enterprises that the Russian economy needs 
additional injections of credit. As we can see, enterprises and 
banks do have money. How these resources are utilized is 
another question. 
  I think the current situation in the currency market is 
giving monetarists some points in their long-standing dispute 
with supporters of state regulation. This situation 
unambiguously says that money will not be channeled into a 
structural reorganization of industry until it becomes possible 
to achieve financial stabilization,. 
  At any rate, it is not clear how those who are fighting for 
additional injections of credit and those who are now acquiring 
decisive influence in the Russian Government can respond. It 
would be a great pity if they bank on tight control over the 
exchange rate and on abandoning market mechanisms of regulating 
the currency market. This would be not just a step back but 
effectively the abandonment of reforms.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by Andrey Vladimirov: "Two Tactics for the </F>
Reformers. To Remain in Government or Go Into Constructive 
Opposition?"] 
  [Text] Whatever the end of the "rotation" of cadres saga 
which began as a result of Yegor Gaydar's resignation statement 
Sunday, the very fact of this "incident" already speaks volumes. 
It feels like a new revolt or coup, or Zhirinovskiy's final 
victory at some future elections, has just been announced. And 
this is despite the fact that, even without Gaydar, the 
government managed to maintain its reformist course in the first 
nine months of last year. But now is not September 1993 but 
January 1994. 
  Last fall it seemed that the market coordinates had finally 
been plotted and that the government's policy had been entirely 
formalized in this sense. The elections in December 1993 
confirmed the forecast of virtually all sober analysts that 
opposition in society could not be eliminated through coercive 
methods and the situation of September-October 1993 would be 
repeated more than once according to the same pattern. And 
therefore it would be just as difficult to carry out a liberal 
economic policy as before the October events and the elections. 
As it turns out, it is even harder. 
  Can it be that Gaydar, whose intellect is equal to the sum 
of 
all three presidential analytical centers now undergoing reform, 
did not realise this? Can it be that his resignation was 
predetermined even before the December elections? 
  Let us suppose that Gaydar will stay in the government, or 
return to it. What will this change? It is extremely difficult 
to carry out a liberal economic policy today given the present 
composition of the government. The combination of Gaydar, 
Zaveryukha, Soskovets, and Chubays produces, in Yegor 
Timurovich's own words, "an indeterminate state." Economically 
irresponsible decisions -- for which, as always, no one knows 
who answers -- brought about the "breakdown" of this politician, 
dubbed in journalists' circles "the Iron Winnie the Pooh." Even 
"iron" politicians have emotions. 
  It is quite another matter that the presence of Gaydar in 
the 
government, given his entirely understandable unwillingness to 
take responsibility for inflationary decisions, in itself might 
have become a factor maintaining the reformist line in a more or 
less acceptable form. But Gaydar is going to the Duma. And 
here there is an element not only of emotions but normal 
political tactics. However, will the economic price of this 
tactic -- a budget deficit -- not be too high? And has not too 
high a price for the elections already been paid in a political 
sense? 
  As Gaydar himself once remarked, a government of like-minded 
individuals is a rare phenomenon. Such a government arises in 
specific situations, such as, for example, the situation of 
November 1991. Is not Gaydar preparing to return to the 
government in precisely such a situation -- but to a homogeneous 
rather than a coalition government? 
  There are two fundamentally different tactics for the 
reformers. The first is to remain in the government and carry 
out their promises: 5-7 percent inflation by the end of the 
year, financial stabilization, ensuring a favorable climate for 
investments, slowing the production slump and gradually boosting 
production -- but not by printing money. 
  Taking account of the emerging composition of the 
government, 
the hints of a soft reorientation of economic policy, and the 
gamble of the cabinet's conservative wing on economic populism, 
the reformers cannot be confident that it will be possible to 
fulfill this program. Naturally, they have no desire to share 
responsibility for economic failures with the proinflationists. 
Which means that they have to leave the government -- that is 
the second tactical option. And not simply leave, but become 
parliamentary oppositionists and criticize expenditure 
decisions, pumping money into production sectors, growing 
hyperinflation, and other such socialist "measures" that will 
inevitably follow their resignations. 
  No one knows how events will develop. Which of the reformers 
will remain "hostages" in the government is also not yet clear. 
It cannot be ruled out that the logic of reforms will again 
return key reformers to Chernomyrdin's cabinet, as happened in 
1993. 
  In the final analysis, it is too early to speak about a 
reorientation of the policy and the views of the incumbent 
premier -- after Yeltsin the second most notable political 
figure of the past year. It also cannot be ruled out that 
another team of reformers will take over the executive levers -- 
we all know which team I am talking about. 
  Complex political horse-trading lies ahead. All the same, 
the last word will probably belong to the president.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 18 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- The leaders of the 
Democratic Russia movement declared that they are moving across 
to the antigovernment camp. Following ultimatums on the 
membership of the government, the Coordinating Council of 
Democratic Russia announced today that it will act "as an 
opponent to the course of the government headed by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin." 
  The statement says that Russia is leaving the course of 
reform. The leaders of Democratic Russia believe that this is 
borne out by Yegor Gaydar's refusal to join the new government. 
"Gaydar's departure is in line with events and confirms the 
general tendency toward curtailing the course of reform in the 
country," the statement says. 
  The leaders of Democratic Russia are threatening to organize 
statements in the press, and also to hold mass acts of protest 
against the government's policies. The first meeting of 
Moscow's public has been set by the leaders of Democratic Russia 
for 22 January.

<F P=106> [From 18 January RAHVA HAAL, p 1] </F>
  [Text] Tuesday, January 18 -- Estonian-Russian dual 
citizenship would present a major threat to Estonians national 
security, Minister for Ethnic Affairs Peeter Olesk warned. 
  "The introduction of the dual citizenship is an element of 
the Russian national policy that all the leading Russian 
ideologists have been calling for. It would enable a hidden 
restoration of the former Soviet Union," Olesk warned. 
  There are approximately 41,000 Russian citizens in Estonia, 
but it is difficult to establish, whether they have dual 
citizenship, since Russia is hiding the information, Olesk said. 
If the Estonian authorities do not know who the Russian 
citizens are, Russia can always consider any act directed 
against such persons as a provocation, the minister warned. 
These persons will be used as tools in case Russia needs to 
prove violations of human rights in Estonia, Olesk predicted.

<F P=106> [Report from press center of the Foreign Ministry of the </F>
Republic of Latvia] 
  [Text] According to reports in the Russian media, at a 
discussion meeting of Russian foreign ministry organizations, 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev made a speech of a conceptual 
nature touching on relations with the Baltic countries. The 
report expresses ideas that are contrary to Russia's previous 
official position, and which are to be regarded as threats to 
Latvia's sovereignty. The Baltic states, including Latvia, are 
named as a region in which Russia's most important interests are 
concentrated, and from which the greatest danger to Russia's 
interests comes. Thus it is important that Russia should not 
leave, and should not withdraw its troops from these regions. 
  The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Latvia is analyzing 
the new situation. Latvia will also propose discussing this 
issue at tomorrow's meeting of the three Baltic prime ministers 
in Jurmala.

  [Text] The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry has voiced concern 
about Russia's attitude toward the Baltic states, which it calls 
the near abroad. Lithuania does not agree with such a term and 
is concerned, because Russia is again reproaching for 
infringements on human rights in the Baltic countries, which 
does not correspond to reality, says the Lithuanian Foreign 
Ministry document. 
  Lithuania's reaction followed a statement made by Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Tuesday on Russia's vital 
interest in the CIS countries and the Baltics, which says that 
the Baltic states are the zone of Russia's most important 
interest and Russia need not withdraw its troops from the 
region. 
  The Russian foreign minister also demanded to legalize 
double 
[as heard] citizenship. Only people of the independent 
Lithuania and power structures supported by them can decide what 
way of granting citizenship is to be opted for. And any 
pressure [words indistinct] (?as interference in the Lithuanian 
internal affairs), according to the statement of the Lithuanian 
Foreign Ministry. 
  The document says that Russia apparently has not given up 
its 
military influence in the Baltic states.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mircea Dascaliuc from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] The Military Council of the 14th Russian Army 
yesterday adopted and published a toughly worded statement in 
which the authorities of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic 
are warned that decisive retaliatory measures will be taken, 
including the use of arms, if the denigration and attacks on the 
personnel and military objectives of the Russian Federation's 
Army continue. 
  Likewise, the statement calls on the president of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, Igor Smirnov, and the leader 
of the Supreme Soviet, Grigore Maracuta, to investigate in a 
principled manner the illegal actions committed against soldiers 
of the Russian Army and inform the 14th Army Command of the 
steps taken. 
  This quasi-ultimatum attitude is the result of the 
increasing 
tension in Tiraspol, where, for some time, the Dniester leaders, 
on the one hand, and General Lebed and Colonel Mihailov Bergman, 
on the other, have been engaged in a real duel of mutual 
accusations. 
  After General Lebed's recent meeting with directors of 
schools and presidents of the trade union committees of these 
institutions, to whom he suggested civic disobedience, and at 
which meeting the Tiraspol leadership was harshly criticized, 
the Russian officer was accused of plotting the overthrow of the 
government. University Professor Vasiliy Yakovlev, leader of a 
group of civic organizations, described the general as an agent 
of the Moldovan Republic. Regarding the general's participation 
in a meeting convened by the Tiraspol Town Educational 
Directorate, the same Yakovlev accused General Lebed of being an 
accomplice in the Romanization of education in the Dniester 
region by recognizing the right of Moldovan children to study in 
Romanian in Latin script. 
  Likewise, in a statement adopted recently, the aktiv of the 
Interior Ministry expressed its determination to defend the 
statehood of the so-called Dniester Republic, no matter from 
where the threats may come. Deputy Interior Minister Nicolay 
Medveev called for the two Russian officers to be declared 
persona non grata and expelled from the Dniester region. All 
this has increased tension in Tiraspol alarmingly. As the local 
correspondent of the National Radio Network of the Republic of 
Moldova reported, in a way, a certain duality of power has been 
established in the town. Both sides have sufficient and 
well-equipped military and paramilitary forces. 
  Yesterday, General Aleksandr Lebed, writing in IZVESTIYA, 
proposed a solution, quote: to eliminate all odious elements -- 
certainly he was referring to the Tiraspol leaders -- organize 
new elections, and put certain credible persons in power.

  [Text] Yesterday Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin 
had a telephone conversation with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman 
of the Georgian parliament and head of state. 
  The Russian president, who telephoned Tbilisi, announced 
that 
he had been planning to pay an official visit to Georgia at the 
end of January 1994. However, since he understood full well the 
importance of Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to France [beginning 
20 January] not only for Georgia and the CIS member countries, 
but also for the international community, he decided to postpone 
his visit until February. 
  As agreed, a meeting of the Russian and Georgian prime 
ministers will be held ahead of Boris Yeltsin's visit. 
  Today, Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia starts a 
three-day working visit to the Russian capital. The main 
objective of the Georgian prime minister's visit is to conclude 
the preparation of a comprehensive friendship and cooperation 
treaty between Russia and Georgia. 
  It is expected that this treaty will be signed during Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi set for 3-4 February. 
  The final details of the treaty will be agreed on Wednesday 
or Thursday at a meeting between Otar Patsatsia and Viktor 
Chernomyrdin.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- The pledge made by the 
Russian and American presidents at their Moscow summit to target 
Russian and American missiles away from the major cities of the 
two countries before May 30, 1994 was largely political and 
diplomatic in nature, intended to demonstrate a warmer 
relationship between Moscow and Washington, a briefing in the 
Russian Defence Ministry was told today. 
  As concerns the military aspect of the relevant clause in 
the 
Moscow declaration, which Yeltsin and Clinton signed last week, 
the change of targets reduces the first-strike threat, the risk 
of an unsanctioned launch, and thereby the danger of nuclear war 
in general, according to Major-General Anatoliy Svetikov, who 
represented the Russian strategic missile forces at the briefing. 
  The presidents promised to re-target their missiles not 
later 
than May 30, 1994. But in actual fact, target coordinates can 
be changed within 15 to 20 minutes, the general said. 
  According to specialists, the procedure is not very 
complicated -- the target coordinates which can guide a missile 
to the United States or Russia will be replaced in the missile 
computer memory with the coordinates of one or another deserted 
areas in the world ocean. 
  According to American sources, about twenty such areas have 
been identified to become the main targets in the missile 
computer memories. Reserve coordinates will be saved in the 
memory as well. If all coordinates are deleted from memory, the 
missile can hit land in the same area from which it was launched.

  [Text] United Nations January 19 TASS -- Russian Permanent 
Delegate at the United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov and U.S. 
Permanent Delegate at the United Nations Madeleine Albright made 
a joint statement to journalists accredited at the U.N. 
headquarters on Tuesday concerning the results of the Moscow 
summit meeting. 
  The Russian and American representatives drew the attention 
of world public opinion to an important item of the Moscow 
declaration, signed by the Presidents of Russia and the United 
States, in which they have reaffirmed their support to the 
United Nations Organisation and called for joint efforts to 
strengthen the U.N. peacekeeping role. Vorontsov and Albright 
stated in part: 
  "Both presidents have stressed the need to strengthen the 
U.N. ability to keep the peace and prevent conflicts. They made 
it incumbent on our two governments to work jointly in order to 
improve the mechanism in this sphere. We express mutual 
satisfaction, and this is particularly important, that our two 
presidents have called for a Security Council meeting at summit 
level to mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. 
  "It is clear that by making this statement, both Russia and 
the United States thereby recognise and prize the central role 
played by the United Nations, particularly, the U.N. 
peacekeeping operations and efforts to safeguard international 
peace and security in this increasingly chaotic and unstable 
world." 
  The Russian and American representatives also stated that 
they would cooperate closely in the effort to ensure the success 
of the U.N. Security Council meeting at summit level, proposed 
by the Presidents of Russia and the United States.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikita Lyutyy on open letter from </F>
Mayor Luzhkov of Moscow to Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin: "Will There be Bread for Muscovites?"] 
  [Text] Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov has written Viktor 
Chernomyrdin an open letter. The capital's chief is worried 
about the fact that certain members of government are trying to 
"push through" a plan for the elimination of federal food 
stocks, introduce high customs duties on food, put a stop to 
preferential credits, and abolish foreign food subsidies. 
  It is for the State Committee on Antimonopoly Policy to 
decide whether or not there is a deal between the organ of state 
power and the major economic bodies. But the fact remains that 
the adoption of these decisions can only benefit our food 
lobbyists -- the monopolists -- and will hit the pockets of 
practically all strata of the population hard. For example, 
Russian sugar magnates are greatly irked by the fact that 
imported sugar retails at 600 rubles [R] per kg, whereas sugar 
leaves our refineries at a price of R900 per kg. But since they 
do not want the bother of cutting production costs and so on, 
the monopolists dream about using their own sector ministers' 
hands to strangle foreign competitors. 
  Moreover, the open letter points out, given the current 
decline in agricultural production, Muscovites can rely neither 
on Russia's regions nor on the CIS countries. For instance, in 
the first six months of 1994 the proposed volumes of purchases 
of vegetable oil for the capital are only 7 percent of what is 
required, while the equivalent figures for meat and meat 
products are 35 percent, for butter 41 percent, and for powdered 
milk 63 percent. 
  "By informing you of this," Yuriy Luzhkov writes, "we hope, 
Esteemed Viktor Stepanovich, to secure your assistance and 
support and ask you to prevent the situation from becoming 
critical by immediately adopting the Russian Federation 
Government draft decree, elaborated by the ministries and 
departments in conjunction with the Moscow government in 
accordance with your instructions, on providing the population 
of Moscow with food. The examination of it by the Russian 
Federation Economics and Finance Ministries has been delayed for 
no reason since last November." 
  Rather long-winded, but very urgent and timely. The 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA editorial office, which, for obvious reasons, 
lives in Moscow, fully endorses its mayor's request.

  [Text] INTERFAX has learned that a session of the RF 
[Russian Federation] Security Council to be chaired by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin is to be held on Wednesday, January 19. 
Well-informed sources assert that the agenda will include 
several issues related to the development of Russia's military 
doctrine confirmed by the Security Council last November. In 
particular, it is to consider several military-technical aspects 
of the doctrine. 
  This document contains a model of the defensive-industrial 
complex activity under the system of market relations. 
Competitive development of arms proclaimed by the doctrine must 
rule out harmful parallelism in creation and development of 
various kinds of armaments and to provide for rational spending 
of allocated funds. 
  High quality of the Russian army's military equipment should 
enjoy priority. The document stresses that military equipment 
of the Russian army should obligatorily correspond to world 
standards. 
  The session to be held behind closed doors is to consider 
several issues regarding recent reshuffles in the supreme 
echelons of power.

  [Text] The family of Zviad Gamsakhurdia has agreed to a 
post mortem examination of the body of the Georgian 
ex-president, who committed suicide on the night from December 
31 to January 1 in Western Georgia. The examination must be 
held with international observers, Interfax learnt from sources 
in the Georgian Prosecutor General's Office. 
  A Georgian Security Ministry spokesman has told Interfax 
that 
the arrival in the republic of international experts and members 
of the Gamsakhurdia family is possible shortly. 
  Zviadists who control the village of Djikhashkari in western 
Georgia where Gamsakhurdia is presumably buried are not so far 
allowing representatives of the present authorities or 
journalists to the village. 
  The village is guarded, Interfax was told, by a large group 
of Zviadists who are armed with tanks, artillery pieces and 
rocket launchers. 
  As it has become known to Interfax from unofficial sources, 
representatives of the Georgian authorities are negotiating the 
issue with Zviadists. The talks have provided no results yet 
because the authorities demand the extradition of Gamsakhurdia's 
body and Zviadists' disarmament.

well-informed sources that Georgian ex-President Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia is alive and well and living in Helsinki. In her 
opinion, the statements about the death of the ex-president were 
simple deception. In the near future (?there will be a

  [Text] According to a NeGa agency report, the damage from 
the explosion yesterday on the Georgian section of the pipeline 
providing gas to Armenia is greater than that caused by earlier 
acts of sabotage. Some 800 meters of the main trunk line were 
put out of action, the bridge over the Kura River was destroyed, 
and the back-up pipeline was badly damaged. As is known, as a 
result of the earlier acts of sabotage, no gas has been pumped 
to Armenia since 18 December. Experts believe that it will be a 
month before the gas pipeline is back in service, since the 
approaches to the damaged area have been mined. The Armenian 
side is blaming a subversive group from Azerbaijan for the 
sabotage.

  [Text] The Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers has 
adopted a decree on the supply of fuel and electric power to 
economic complexes and the population during the first three 
months of 1994. According to this decree, a reduction in the 
supply of thermal power and the economical use of existing fuel 
and power resources are viewed as a task of particular 
importance. The appropriate institutions and departments are 
entrusted with reducing street lighting and all kinds of neon 
advertising by 50 percent and regulating independent sources of 
electric power. 
  According to the decree, schedules for the supply, 
production, use, and allocation of gas and electric power have 
to be established. The 5,000 tonnes of (?kerosene) that has 
arrived in the form of humanitarian aid from Japan is to be 
taken into consideration. 
  It is stated in the decree that, in addition to local 
administrative bodies, the Republic of Georgia Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense should ensure the 
protection of electric power installations in Georgia.

  [Text] Tbilisi, January 12 (SNARK) -- Today the Georgian 
Parliament goes on discussing a statement of Vakhtang Goguadze 
about the necessity of Georgia's entrance to the rouble zone. 
Yesterday parliamentarians and government officials expressed 
their opinion of that. The opposition, including Nodar Natadze, 
the leader of the National Front, considers Georgia's entrance 
to the rouble zone as a loss of independence. 
  Vice-Premier Amiran Kadagishvili in his statement doubted 
that Russia would accept Georgia to the rouble zone. In the 
opinion of the Georgian Finance Minister David Jakobidze, the 
concurrent introduction of the Russian rouble and the Georgian 
coupon is necessary. 
  In the interview to the SNARK reporter Nodar Djavakhishvili 
said that Russia proposes unacceptable terms. He is of the 
opinion that monetary and credit emission is to be cut down, the 
budget deficit should be minimal and crediting has to be stopped.

  [Text] Here is news from Georgia. Here is what Zurab 
Dvali, correspondent of the independent agency IPRINDA reports 
from Tbilisi by telephone: 
  [Dvali] This morning a Georgian Government delegation headed 
by head of state Eduard Shevardnadze left by plane for a two-day 
visit to Turkey. 
  In the course of this summit meeting, a large package of 
economic agreements and also of cooperation in the sphere of 
culture and tourism will be signed. The plane stopped over in 
Batumi where the government delegation was joined by Aslan 
Abashidze, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Autonomous 
Republic of Ajaria. 
  Also today, a meeting took place between the Georgian 
Government delegation and Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel. 
  Meanwhile, in the republic's parliamentary building, the 
meeting continued between Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze and deputies 
who are interested in his proposal regarding Georgia joining the 
ruble zone. The parliamentarians listened with great interest to 
the address by the republic's former Deputy Prime Minister Roman 
Gotsiridze, who analyzed the situation regarding the Georgian 
coupon. He stated that he is amazed by the statement by the 
head of state that the introduction in the republic of coupons 
has been a hasty and erroneous decision. Gotsiridze said that 
he himself had taken a direct part in the talks with Russia and 
that he is certain that Georgia would never receive Russian 
money and would not be able to join the ruble zone. In this 
way, according to him, putting the Georgian coupon into 
circulation was the only way out of the situation that had 
arisen. What is more, according to the former deputy prime 
minister, Russia will never give Georgia the promised technical 
credit. Gotsiridze stressed that in his view, Georgia is being 
run by a technocratic lobby made up of party functionaries and 
the armed mafia. It is they who have organized this 
unprecedented hyperinflation, which in the final analysis will 
result in the establishment in Georgia of an authoritarian 
regime, the former deputy prime minister remarked at the end of 
his speech. 
  The speeches made by the opposition-minded deputies were of 
approximately the same content. The only thing that is amazing, 
as local observers note, is the fact that for the time being no 
one has asked Russia itself whether it would agree to Georgia 
joining the ruble zone.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva January 14 TASS -- "Russia is ready to 
continue playing the role of mediator in the Abkhazian conflict. 
Our participation in the search for reconciliation will be most 
active, vigorous, and practical," ITAR-TASS was told by Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, who headed the Russian 
delegation to the second round of Georgian-Abkhazian 
negotiations, held in Geneva from January 11-13. 
  "The three-day intensive debates were rounded off by a joint 
communique, outlining the priority measures to settle the 
problem of refugees and to strengthen confidence and security. 
One more important step was made towards a full-scale 
settlement of the conflict," the Russian representative said. 
He believes that the mutually confirmed commitment of the sides 
not to resort to force or to threats to use it was among the 
main results of the meeting. 
  "Both sides are now even more aware that stable peace cannot 
be ensured without international observers and peace-making 
forces. The sides, involved in the conflict, have expressed 
their common consent to see a Russian military contingent as 
part of the peacekeeping force. Russia will discharge 
peace-keeping functions if a corresponding decision is adopted 
by the Security Council and the Russian leadership. The number 
of the needed servicemen will be determined by the mandate 
issued by the U.N. Security Council," Pastukhov stated. 
  "Agreement was reached that a team of experts would discuss 
in Moscow the key problem of the settlement -- the future 
political status of Abkhazia. As to the position of the United 
Nations, Russia and CSCE, they urge the sides in the communique 
to proceed from the need of ensuring Georgia's territorial 
integrity and to fully guarantee the interests of the entire 
multinational population of Abkhazia.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Pribytkov report under "Conflict" rubric: </F>
"Talks Promise Peace in Abkhazia"] 
  [Text] Geneva -- After repeatedly approaching the danger 
line and teetering on the verge of failure the second round of 
talks in Geneva on a Georgian-Abkhazian settlement has ended 
successfully. The intensive three-day discussions, which went on 
virtually around the clock, resulted in decisions on the most 
complex problems in the Abkhazian drama, such as the return of 
the refugees, the strengthening of confidence and security, and 
the use of peacekeeping forces. These decisions have been 
included in the communique of the meeting, which was signed by 
the heads of the delegations and the representatives of the 
United Nations, Russia, and the CSCE. 
  The present round of talks in Geneva, like the previous one 
(30 November-1 December), has been conducted under the aegis of 
the United Nations with Russia's assistance. The Georgian 
delegation was headed by Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the 
Interim Committee for the State of Emergency and parliamentary 
deputy, and the Abkhazian delegation by Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, 
chairman of the Council of Ministers. 
  A lot of effort had to be exerted by the international 
mediators -- Edouard Brunner, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy, and Boris Pastukhov, Russian Federation deputy foreign 
minister -- to make agreement possible. 
  One of the main results was the commitment, affirmed by the 
sides in the communique, not to use force and not to resort to 
the threat of force. The sides asked the UN Security Council to 
extend the mandate of the UN observation mission in Georgia, 
instructing it to monitor the nonresumption of hostilities. 
They advocated locating in the conflict zone UN peacekeeping 
forces or other forces sanctioned by the United Nations, 
expressing mutual agreement to the use of a Russian military 
contingent within them. The stationing of the "blue helmets" 
must be followed by the withdrawal of all armed formations 
within five days from the Inguri River and other possible zones 
of confrontation -- their place will be taken by the 
peacekeeping forces. The sundry volunteer formations and 
individuals who have arrived to participate in the conflict must 
be disarmed and withdrawn. 
  A commission for refugee problems is being formed with the 
participation of representatives of the sides, the United 
Nations, and Russia. It is planned to start the phased return 
of refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia as of 10 February 
-- to Galskiy Rayon in the first phase. The most difficult 
question involved in finding a settlement -- that of Abkhazia's 
future political status -- will be discussed within the 
framework of the previously formed group of experts, which will 
meet for its next sitting 8 February in Moscow. On 22 February 
the delegations and international mediators intend to conduct a 
new round of talks in Moscow or Geneva. 
  As Sandro Kavsadze, member of the Georgian delegation and 
chairman of the Georgian committee for human rights and 
interethnic relations, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the 
talks have made it possible "to move toward a settlement." 
Although the discussion was of a "very sharp nature and there 
were some fairly conflictual situations," "we reached agreement 
and understanding on the main issues." 
  Having noted the great significance of the agreements, 
Sokrat 
Dzhindzholiya, head of the Abkhazian delegation, emphasized the 
important role of the Russian Federation in the settlement. 
"Thanks to the efforts of the Russian delegation and Russia as a 
whole, many positive results were achieved," he said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS's correspondent. "Even in the past the 
Russian Federation did all it could to bring our positions 
closer together. Indeed, life itself evidently preordains it to 
participate in the fate of the peoples which were brought 
together by the Soviet Union."

  [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has 
assessed the trilateral agreement on nuclear disarmament signed 
by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow on January 14 
as "timely." "Ukraine has been and will be a great missile and 
space power regardless of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from 
our territory," he told a meeting with the heads of the mass 
media in Kiev. "We have everything necessary to build missiles 
and fly into space," he added. 
  Speaking on his attitude to the presidential elections in 
Crimea, Radetskyy pointed out that as defense minister he 
regarded this event "normally." "But as a citizen of Ukraine, I 
am confident that there must be only one president in the 
republic," he said. 
  The minister also said an inspection of the Black Sea Fleet 
will be carried out in the near future. He said it was "costly" 
for both Russia and Ukraine to maintain the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Summing up the results of the first two years since the 
creation of the Ukrainian army, Radetskyy said that during this 
time Ukraine concluded bilateral agreements on military 
cooperation with 19 states. During Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's visit to Kiev scheduled for January 20-21, such an 
agreement is expected to be signed with Kazakhstan, too. 
  According to Radetskyy, by now the Ukrainian army has been 
reduced by over 200,000 troops compared to last year. By the 
end of 1995, the republican armed forces will have 450,000 
personnel.

  [Text] Comments on the tripartite negotiations by the 
Ukrainian, American, and Russian presidents that took place on 
18 January in Moscow were presented at a briefing held at the 
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. In particular, it was noted that 
the tripartite declaration adopted at the negotiations is a 
document containing political obligations regarding moving 
toward nuclear disarmament. It is of crucial importance for 
Ukraine because since the entire rocket-launching infrastructure 
is stationed outside of Ukraine, nuclear weapons are not a 
deterring factor for our state, as well as because the rockets, 
whose storage expiration terms are already ending, pose a 
serious environmental threat to Ukraine itself. So the juggling 
of some Ukrainian political forces with people's patriotic 
feelings inflicts only damages. Responding to a question about 
compensating Ukraine for the value of the enriched uranium 
contained in warheads that are located on its territory, the 
briefing organizers said that it will be provided in the form of 
heat-emitting elements for (?Alpha). At the negotiations, Bill 
Clinton reiterated the U.S. pledge to allocate about $800 
million for Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to heighten 
safety [words indistinct] nuclear forces and storage of 
decomposable materials. At the initial stage, Ukraine will 
receive $175 million.

  [Excerpts] The trilateral statement by the Ukrainian, U.S., 
and Russian presidents, adopted in Moscow, is Ukrainian 
diplomacy's great achievement. This was announced at a briefing 
at the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry on 18 January. Tamara 
Kucherenko reports the details: 
  [Kucherenko] [passage omitted] So what does the trilateral 
statement provide for? This is how Oleksandr Chalyy, head of 
the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's agreements and law directorate, 
replied to a question from journalists: 
  [Begin Chalyy recording] This document outlined and took up 
political obligations in respect of (?the course) of 
disarmament: Ukraine will only disarm when the last missile on 
its territory is gone. Legally I cannot see how this process 
can even begin in purely technical and formal terms on the 
grounds of this statement alone. 
  The obligations in the statement are very general. If we 
look at the package of documents relating to START, however, the 
obligations there are very specific. In other words, you and we 
all have to understand that if START I is not ratified, the 
actual implementation of the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine 
within the framework of some general obligations and of this 
statement alone is impossible. 
  That is to say, the statement -- as I understood the 
president's statement -- means that the issue of START and the 
Lisbon protocol must by all means be conclusively settled at the 
Supreme Council. Without this, the implementation of this 
statement is impossible even from the standpoint that it is in 
need of financing. And who keeps a hold on the budget of 
Ukraine? It is the parliament that adopts the budget. 
  So this is a document on implementing the [Ukrainian Supreme 
Council START I ratification] resolution, and I believe that 
without the parliament assessing the relationship between the 
resolution and the statement, we will not be able to ratify 
START I. There is the desire of the executive power, which has 
taken certain steps and is proposing today to (?view this in the 
long term). But do these steps correspond with the general 
reservations in the resolution? Perhaps the parliament will now 
retract some reservations contained in this resolution. But 
this is the parliament's right. [end recording] 
  [Kucherenko] Another question raised by journalists at the 
briefing was that of compensation for the nuclear warheads 
removed from Ukraine. Specifically, is the payment of $175 
million not too little? Oleksandr Chalyy says: 
  [Begin Chalyy recording] The United States will work 
together 
with Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to increase this 
aid specifically allocated to nuclear disarmament. So one 
should not understand 170 [as heard] as the final figure. 
Moreover, I believe it can by no means be final. No, it is 
not. This is how we understand it. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, 19 January -- Issues of European security 
and prospects for Ukraine's cooperation with Western military 
and political organizations were discussed at meetings between 
Vasyl Durdynets, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council, and Willem van Eekelen, secretary general of the 
Western European Union [WEU]. Mr. Durdynets focused the 
attention of his interlocutor on the importance of guaranteeing 
territorial integrity and security of Ukraine as an inalienable 
condition of peace and stability. 
  Issues of Ukraine's integration into the European economic 
processes and the necessity of overcoming as soon as possible of 
Ukrainian artificial isolation from the European and world 
economic space were discussed at a meeting between Vasyl 
Durdynets and the leading members of staff of the European 
Community Commission. 
  Talks with NATO Deputy Secretary General Von Moltke [title 
as 
received], members of the staff of the International 
Secretariat, and representatives of the NATO member states in 
the Political Committee of this organization were dedicated to 
Ukraine's participation in the program "Partnership for Peace" 
and a profound explanation of Ukraine's stand on nuclear 
disarmament issues. 
  Taking part in the meetings were also the leaders of the 
Ukrainian president's service for international issues Anton 
Buteyko and Ukraine's ambassador to Benelux, Vasylenko. 
  This has been reported by the information department of the 
Foreign Ministry of Ukraine.

  [Text] Chairman of Ukrainian Gosatomnadzor (state committee 
for supervising safety requirements at nuclear power stations) 
Nikolay Steinberg believes that Kiev is "not obliged to inform 
Moscow of all accidents at Ukrainian nuclear power stations 
since we have not signed any bilateral agreements on exchange of 
nuclear information." 
  In an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine, Steinberg pointed out 
that "there exists a coherent international system for the 
notification of the nuclear situation in the world, under which 
all members of the European Nuclear Society inform the 
headquarters of this organization based in Switzerland of 
accidents at their nuclear power stations, which distributes the 
information among the other member-states." 
  Meanwhile, the head of the press service of the Russian 
Gosatomnadzor, Yuriy Rogozhin, told INTERFAX yesterday that 
failures to inform the Russian Gosatomnadzor by former Soviet 
republics violate the official agreement between the nuclear 
supervising organizations reached shortly after the break-up of 
the Soviet Union.

Yevpatoria in the Crimea. This was reported today by Ukraine's 
National Space Agency. 
  The center was set up in 1960 under the leadership of Sergey 
Korolev. It has been out of action for the past year and a half 
because of attempts to divide it between Ukraine and Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Jan--Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of 
the Black Sea Fleet, signed an order today enlisting Ivan 
Yermakov under his own command. Yermakov had been removed from 
the office of representative of the Ukrainian president in 
Sevastopol. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the 
headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet that the decision coincides 
with the opinion of Yermakov himself, who previously occupied 
the office of head of an aircraft repair plant and has the rank 
of colonel in the Navy. Moreover, he never took the Ukrainian 
oath and did not express any desire to serve in the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces. 
  The commander of the Black Sea Fleet has ordered the head of 
the fleet's personnel department to establish Yermakov in the 
post within two months in keeping with his wishes.

  [Text] On 18 January Anatoliy Plyushko, Ukrainian 
ambassador to the People's Republic of China, had a meeting with 
(Dai Bingo), PRC assistant foreign affairs minister. The 
ambassador gave a detailed account of the results of the meeting 
between the Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian presidents in Moscow 
and the contents of the declaration they signed. It was 
emphasized that the accords, reached as the result of the 
meeting, on providing Ukraine with security guarantees, as well 
as financial and technological assistance for eliminating 
nuclear weapons and compensation for uranium contained in 
nuclear warheads were creating the necessary conditions for 
gradual elimination of the nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian 
soil and for Ukraine to attain nonnuclear status. It said that 
the accords, to a considerable degree, were resolving the 
problems that caused the Ukrainian Supreme Council to have 
reservations about ratifying the START I treaty and the Lisbon 
protocol. 
  The hope was expressed that, as a nuclear power and 
permanent 
member of the UN Security Council, China would play an active 
part in settling the issue of nuclear disarmament in Ukraine 
and, in particular, of providing Ukraine with security 
guarantees and financial assistance in order to eliminate the 
nuclear weapons deployed on its territory.

  [Text] Warsaw -- For the first time since the war an 
intelligence officer from the eastern border will appear before 
a Polish military court. He is Anatoliy Lysenko, a 40-year-old 
Ukrainian special services major. He was given away by a Polish 
agent he himself recruited three years ago. 
  The agent will not escape the dock either. He is Janus B., a 
22-year-old technical construction worker. Dozens of times he 
illegally carried copper into Ukraine and spirits on the return 
journey. Ukrainian border guards caught the smuggler, and 
eventually he agreed to work for Ukrainian security service 
organs. Janus delivered to Lysenko information about political 
and other events in Poland's eastern provinces and church life. 
  Lysenko was arrested in August 1992 when crossing the 
border.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
Stanislav Prokopchuk; place and date not given: "Leonid 
Kravchuk: Let's Take Account of Today's Realities"] 
  [Text] [Prokopchuk] Leonid Makarovich, what is your view of 
the present situation in Ukraine, above all the financial and 
economic situation? Does the country indeed face financial 
collapse in the next few months, as certain foreign observers 
and also some Ukrainian politicians claim? 
  [Kravchuk] The situation is grave, even very grave. There 
is inflation, the crisis in industry, the slump in 
production.... This is all true, so to speak. I will mention a 
few of what I see as the main reasons for our economy's plight. 
  When Ukraine was part of the USSR, the main emphasis was 
placed on the development of heavy industry -- mining, 
metallurgy, the chemical industry.... That is, on sectors that 
do not directly benefit people but consume the bulk of energy. 
And when the prices of energy sources quintupled for us in the 
last 18 months, this was naturally bound to affect the entire 
national economic system. On top of that there are the problems 
with the financial and banking system. After all, it 
essentially never existed here. The Ukrainian national bank was 
just a subsidiary of the USSR bank. 
  Another factor has certainly been the cadres problem. Cadres 
have proved unprepared to swiftly restructure our entire economy 
as an autonomous, independent system. Not with a view to 
isolation, but with a view to being able to resolve by our own 
efforts the qualitatively new tasks facing us as a sovereign 
state. 
  [Prokopchuk] Isn't this the explanation of the lurches, 
uncertainty over the choice of path, and sabotage of the 
transformations on the part of the old management apparatus, 
which has barely been renewed at all? 
  [Kravchuk] I would not speak of sabotage as such. That is 
an exaggeration. But the inconsistency of our actions on the 
road to the market is clear. And the replacement of three 
governments is confirmation of that. We are now on our fourth. 
All the previous ones quit under pressure of the situation, on 
the initiative of the Supreme Council. This rapid replacement 
of governments is also not a good thing and has also had an 
adverse effect. 
  The main miscalculation has been the attempt to combine the 
principles of the administrative-edict economy and the market 
economy. Seeing that the switch to market relations is not 
proceeding as rapidly as we would like, our managers have clung 
to familiar levers. Nothing sensible has come of this. And 
only now, in my view, is the government adopting the correct 
course -- an anti-inflationary, market course. But with 
mandatory control on the part of the state. Since at present 
property largely remains in state hands. 
  In short, there are shifts. Over 20,000 enterprises -- 
small, medium, and large -- will be privatized this year. 
  [Prokopchuk] But Western specialists' forecasts are not so 
rosy. It is openly being said that the Ukrainian economy will 
inevitably collapse and that Ukraine is doomed as an independent 
state. Do you share this view? 
  [Kravchuk] I want to answer your question with another -- To 
whose advantage is it for Ukraine to be independent, who 
generally wants this? There had long been balance in the world 
and in Europe, and tested and proven ties in the economy and 
politics had been established. Then all of a sudden the 
geopolitical situation changes sharply. Along with other new 
states, Ukraine appears on the map of the world -- a sizable 
country possessing nuclear weapons, a country with a decent 
industrial potential and fertile soil. Today it is experiencing 
difficulties and economic crisis. But it is capable of becoming 
rich. Calculations show that if normal agricultural production 
and processing are organized, Ukraine can provide not only 
itself but also other countries with piles of foodstuffs. Tell 
me, who benefits by this? So hundreds of complex questions 
arise. 
  Our neighbors also have political interests -- access to 
Europe, access to the sea, access to Crimea.... That is, a 
whole system of views emerges which as I see it boil down to the 
fact that today a great many people are interested in ensuring 
that Ukraine does not make it as an independent state. There is 
the foreign policy factor of press from both East and West. 
  [Prokopchuk] What about domestic political forces? 
  [Kravchuk] Naturally, there are also domestic forces that do 
not want Ukraine to make it as a sovereign state. Some are 
angry with the authorities, whom they describe as partyocratic 
and communist. There are the national-patriots. They are angry 
with Kravchuk and others. But, in opposing the president, they 
are essentially opposing their own people. Although they pay a 
lot of lipservice to the people's interests. 
  There are also forces openly oriented toward the interests 
of 
other states. Admittedly, many people allude only to Russia, 
believing that "Ukrainian" interests predominate there. 
However, I do not share that view. Russia naturally has more 
"Ukrainian" interests than other countries, and there is still a 
very great deal of work to be done to harmonize the interests of 
Ukraine and Russia. But to claim that Russia alone is an 
opponent of our interests, as many people try to make out, is a 
mistake. We simply have not yet found the key to resolving 
questions with Russia. That is my profound conviction. 
  In short, both domestic and external factors are extremely 
complex, and we will have to make great efforts to avoid 
provoking grave confrontations. But I think that thanks to our 
consistency and flexibility, thanks to the fact that we have 
sought and have found compromises, we have managed to retain 
good relations with our neighbors and retain good friends 
abroad. Thanks to our considered actions in resolving internal 
political problems, in particular interethnic problems, and 
thanks to our people's wisdom we have not evoked confrontations 
inside our state, although some people badly want this. We live 
in peace. And this is the most important point. 
  [Prokopchuk] Now let us touch on purely economic problems. 
How was it possible to repay half the debt to Russia? 
  [Kravchuk] First, we began to make savings and we reduced 
consumption. Second, we began to make real repayments, 
realizing that you cannot live in debt. Now, if we manage to 
solve the problem of compensation for nuclear weapons and 
succeed in resolving other questions, in particular the question 
of the Black Sea Fleet, I think we will cope with the problem of 
debts to Russia. 
  Debts are not the most important thing today. Every state 
has them. No one makes a tragedy out of this. A debt can 
always be repaid, there is the basis and prospect for this. The 
most important thing is to learn to work in the new conditions 
and to create competitive output and technologies which will 
make it possible to integrate intensively with the world economy 
and the economy of the Commonwealth countries. 
  [Prokopchuk] What is the situation regarding payment for the 
transit of Russian freight on Ukrainian railroads and Russian 
gas and oil? There are rumors that Russia has already been 
given all Ukrainian compressor stations and other pipeline 
facilities as a contribution toward repaying the debts. 
  [Kravchuk] Those are just rumors. They play into the hands 
of those who are interested in robbing the state. The question 
of transit was raised by our acting Prime Minister Y. 
Zvyahilskyy during talks in Moscow ahead of the Ashgabat meeting. 
  Solutions were found. Russia reduced gas prices, and we 
reduced transit prices accordingly. The same happened with 
Turkmenistan. 
  [Prokopchuk] Private capital and big investors who would 
help fill the empty shelves and remove social tension are not 
shunning Ukraine only because of the political instability. 
They are deterred by the absence of guarantees regarding the 
export of their share of the profits and the absence of a law on 
land assigning to the owners of an enterprise the land on which 
it stands.... Ukraine, bankers claim, is dying for want of 
investment. 
  [Kravchuk] We adopted foreign economic laws back when I was 
chairman of the Supreme Council. At that time we had our laws 
assessed by experts in a number of countries with a developed 
market economy. But when one of our governments received the 
right to issue decrees, it slightly rejigged these laws. A 
number of important provisions that were to investors' advantage 
were removed. 
  We are now rectifying this situation. At any rate, today our 
foreign economic laws are no worse than those operating in other 
countries. They give the right to unimpeded evacuation of 
profits, properly defend the investor's capital, and provide him 
with guarantees and tax breaks. But our presentation of these 
laws is painfully low-key and useless. 
  Another point. If we had a convertible national currency 
and if we managed to curb inflation, investors would be keener 
to come here. That is, today the laws are not the problem. 
  [Prokopchuk] Many people believe that the slump in 
production 
in Ukraine and therefore the decline in the population's living 
standard result from the severing of economic ties with Russia. 
But former Vice Premier B. Pinzenik claims that this is not the 
cause but the effect of the fact "that we have artificially 
blocked the way to the Russian market with quotas, licenses, 
duties, and taxes and, now we have lost this market, have 
nothing with which to purchase Russian energy sources." What is 
your view? 
  [Kravchuk] What happened happened. But now we have removed 
many of the "barriers." But it cannot be said that the 
"barriers" were erected only by Ukraine. When Russia first sent 
us the list of its goods liable to export duties and the list 
ran, I think, to over 2,000 items, I said: What kind of "free 
trade" is this? (Incidentally, our list of goods for which 
special export procedures were introduced at that time consisted 
of only 300 items.) Why did the Russians not lift the ban on 
free trade in their oil, gas, and timber? 
  Moreover, who was the first to start to erect borders 
between 
Ukraine and Russia, who was the first to adopt that decision? 
Russia. But I bear no grudge. Every state has to defend itself 
and its interests. I am merely in favor of ensuring that there 
is no distortion or lack of objectivity. And that mutual 
interests are taken into account and everything is resolved on 
businesslike, partner principles. 
  Why is the European Community prospering? Because there if 
citrus fruit prices in Italy and Spain are at a given level, 
they are the same in France as well, and if somebody wants to 
change something, they assemble for a general council for a 
mutually respectful review of quotas, taxes, and duties. 
  But what happens over here? Russia introduces its own 
prices, its own wages without consulting with anybody.... We 
cannot do this because we are in different leagues. Russia has 
a positive balance, it has colossal natural resources, and it 
can permit itself things that neither we nor other CIS countries 
can permit ourselves. 
  The upshot is that, given the low purchasing power of our 
population and the low prices compared with those in Russia, a 
flood of Ukrainian foodstuffs, anything that can be transported 
and carried, poured into Russia. Our stores and depots were 
stripped bare. So we were forced at the end of the year to 
double or triple food prices in order to halt the plundering of 
the country. Today you can buy a ticket to Moscow or other 
Russian cities without any problem -- the flood of peddlers 
exploiting this "equal, mutually advantageous" cooperation, the 
"consideration" of mutual interests, and the operation of the 
"unified regulatory system" has dried up. 
  This mechanism does not exist; there is only talk about it. 
Just why do those who shove microphones at Ukrainian citizens at 
markets in Bryansk and Smolensk not tell the truth about the 
reasons for these pilgrimages but only screen the "unadorned," 
strictly personal (and "correct," of course) viewpoint of their 
interviewee? 
  [Prokopchuk] Leonid Makarovich, why in your view has the 
ruble zone not worked out? And what is your prediction for the 
future of the CIS? 
  [Kravchuk] I said from the very beginning that there would 
be no ruble zone. Because we have the wrong view of the ruble 
zone and how it should be understood. In history there have 
been dollar pools, sterling zones.... But then each of the 
states belonging to the said zone had its own currency and 
aligned it with the main currency. The dollar, for example. 
But what did we want from the ruble zone? A single ruble -- 
the same for all the states? That is not a ruble zone, but a 
ruble state. 
  Russia must not be blamed here; I would have acted the same 
way as the Central Bank of Russia. If I print the money (and 
this is the greatest asset) I also have to track the money 
supply, the correctness of mutual settlements, prices. If this 
is not done Russia will die, it will be overtaken by stronger 
inflation than we have. To live in different states and set 
your own prices, wages, and taxes while all using the same ruble 
is unrealistic. I talked about this in Moscow when we were 
discussing the problem of the Economic Union. At the time many 
people took exception to what I said. But within a month we had 
confirmation of what I was asserting. Russia has ultimately 
forced out of its zone almost all those who nurtured hopes of 
finding a home in this zone. And Russia is right. It is 
pursuing primarily its own interests and attending to the 
stability of its own monetary system, the prevention of 
inflation, and the strengthening of its own economy. And this is 
natural. This is how we, and others, would act. Charity begins 
at home. 
  As for the fate of the CIS, we are witnessing, as I have 
already said, the improvement of our Commonwealth's structure. 
It is hard to predict today what the specific directions of 
this improvement will be, but the fact that the Commonwealth is 
necessary is beyond doubt. There are two main strands: The 
member countries' common problems must be solved within a CIS 
framework, while questions of relations between individual 
states must be resolved on a bilateral basis. These two strands 
were indeed in evidence during the meetings and talks in 
Ashgabat. 
  Can the Commonwealth, in the long term, become the same kind 
of association of states as the European Union? Maybe, but it 
will take time. The internal complexities in every CIS member 
country are a brake on the processes of the broader and more 
active improvement of the CIS itself. But in the long term, I 
repeat, we can achieve the same kind of union as the EEC. 
  [Prokopchuk] If it isn't a secret, how are the Massandra 
accords on the Black Sea Fleet and other issues being 
implemented? 
  [Kravchuk] There is movement. First and foremost in 
understanding the other side. I proceed on the basis that we 
have already adopted three documents relating to the Fleet -- 
the Yalta, Dagomys, and Massandra accords. When we were 
adopting them we moved first forward and then backward. In any 
event, taking these documents as a whole, they can serve as the 
starting point for steps forward. It was this that I suggested 
to President B. Yeltsin. But the Russian side is seeking to use 
only the Massandra document. And does not wish to take account 
of the two previous documents, which nobody has rescinded. On 
the one side you have a protocol of intent, on the other -- 
signed agreements. 
  You cannot pick and choose only the things which you find 
advantageous and convenient to yourself. It is necessary to 
examine everything as a package, on the basis of mutual 
acceptability, not to exploit the situation and some short-term 
advantages; it is necessary to take the long-term view. 
  If today some people think that a change of borders is 
possible, they are deeply mistaken. Agreement on something 
specific is indeed possible -- there have been examples of this 
in history. But times need to be different for this. It is 
necessary to follow only the path of discussion, the path of 
accords. To try to resolve something by force means to unleash 
conflict. Incidentally, it's not all as simple in the Crimea as 
people sometimes like to suggest. 
  [Prokopchuk] Incidentally, it is 340 years since the 
Pereyaslavl Assembly [which voted for Ukrainian union with 
Muscovy]. 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, we lived together for 340 years and now we 
cannot resolve the problems which have built up and 
accumulated.... I believe that we will have closer ties than 
before, natural ties, not diktat -- older and younger brothers, 
dominant and subordinate peoples. We will cooperate as equal 
partners. We must move toward this kind of relationship calmly, 
smoothly, handsomely, with the understanding that we are Slav 
peoples and are ordained to live together, side by side, 
forever. The only thing is that today no stupidities must be 
committed. By Russia or Ukraine. People must not state that 
Ukraine as such does not exist, and Ukrainian independence is in 
general a "historical mistake." 
  Nor do I share the other side's statements that all the 
difficulties which we have come up against today are "Russian 
intrigues," that it has been the "dirty Muscovites" ["moskali"] 
who have been strangling us all his time.... For some reason 
some people are very keen to cause trouble between us. This is 
why it is necessary not to commit stupidities or ignore today's 
realities. 
  [Prokopchuk] By ratifying START I and the Lisbon Protocol 
with a number of substantial provisos did Ukraine not doom 
itself to a further, tighter credit blockade and uncompromising 
political pressure from the United States and other nuclear 
states? 
  [Kravchuk] The Supreme Council decree includes provisos 
which are perfectly normal and natural, as they say. Yes, 
Ukraine is entitled to compensation for its nuclear weapons, 
Ukraine must have reliable guarantees of its security, Ukraine 
needs assistance to eliminate its nuclear weapons. 
  But the fact that the Supreme Council did not vote to join 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is a major mistake by our 
parliament. I have said and will continue to say this, I will 
insist that the only correct path for us is to join the treaty. 
We cannot change the already adopted course toward nuclear-free 
status. You can build any illusions you like, even about 
creating our own nuclear industry, but they are only illusions. 
It is clear to everyone that we do not need the weapons we 
inherited from the USSR. And nobody will ever use them. 
  Everybody knows that, even if such an insane idea was to 
come into somebody's head, it is practically impossible today 
for Ukraine to launch the missiles. Any of these 176 missiles 
can be launched only on orders from Moscow. This is clear to 
everyone, but nevertheless attempts continue to be made to turn 
us into a bogeyman. 
  In signing the trilateral statement and the annex to it in 
Moscow on 14 January, Ukraine won a political, economic, and 
human victory. The United States, Russia, and the entire world 
community shared it with us. Nobody will now say that Ukraine 
is standing still on the nuclear disarmament road. The road to 
START II and even START III is now open. Mankind has gained 
real hope of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. 
  There is something else I also wish to stress. Most of the 
demands formulated in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's provisos 
relating to ratification of the START I treaty were met. In the 
documents which were signed the United States and Russia stated 
that they respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and 
independence, that is, they are becoming guarantors of our 
security. After acceding to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
-- and I am confident that our parliament will now adopt such a 
decision -- Ukraine will be safeguarded against nuclear attack. 
And, equally importantly, we will receive compensation for the 
uranium in the strategic missile warheads which will be sent to 
Russia, plus financial, scientific, and technical assistance in 
eliminating our nuclear weapons. 
  As for the part of your question relating to a tougher 
credit 
blockade, in December there was indeed a real threat of 
isolation. But now broad political and economic cooperation 
prospects are opening up for us. 
  [Prokopchuk] And a final, purely personal point, Leonid 
Makarovich, if you will permit me. Since you also became head 
of government there has been an obvious increase in your 
workload. Do you manage to carve out time for your family and 
grandchildren? And in general what is your life like outside 
work? 
  [Kravchuk] My grandson Andrey is 13 and as tall as me; he's 
an early developer. And my granddaughter Mashenka is six. 
She's so sweet and interesting. When they are with me it's the 
only time I get completely away from all the worries and 
problems. You have to answer their endless questions, you see. 
When we get involved in their games I myself also become like a 
child. I can play hide-and-seek with my eyes blindfolded; when 
they crawl around on their knees, I crawl around on my knees; 
when they jump, I jump. Those are the times I really relax....

  [Text] Kiev, 17 January -- The leadership of the State 
Independence of Ukraine [DSU] association said the trilateral 
agreement signed in Moscow proves that the policy of Ukraine's 
President Leonid Kravchuk, aimed at Ukraine's unilateral 
disarmament, is leading our state to a national disaster. This 
was said in a DSU statement to Supreme Council Chairman Ivan 
Plyushch. 
  "Despite our critical attitude to the composition of the 
Supreme Council and some of its decisions, we cannot fail to see 
that today it is a lesser evil compared to the presidential 
structures," the statement stresses. The DSU sees Ukraine's 
Supreme Council as an obstacle to the defeatist policy of 
Ukraine's president and believes that after the current Supreme 
Council is dissolved, Leonid Kravchuk will use the temporary 
period of one-man rule to bring Ukraine to its knees with the 
help of Clinton and Yeltsin. 
  The DSU reminds Plyushch that the decision to hold early 
elections on 27 March was adopted in violation of the 
Constitution, under the president's pressure. It calls on the 
chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council to initiate a proposal at 
the next Supreme Council session to postpone the Supreme Council 
elections to a later date. The date of the parliamentary 
elections can be set to coincide with the next presidential 
election or with the expiry of the current Supreme Council's 
five-year term, the DSU believes. 
  During this time, according to the DSU, the Supreme Council 
must approve a law on impeachment of the president of Ukraine 
and apply it before the next elections.

  [Text] Ukraine's president did not betray anything because 
one cannot betray something he did not dedicate himself to. Les 
Tanyuk, member of the presidium of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine and of the central leadership of the Ukrainian People's 
Movement for Perestroyka [Rukh], said this to a RUKH-PRESS 
correspondent. The act committed by Leonid Kravchuk on 14 
January in Moscow did not give any advantages whatsoever to 
Ukraine, either in the political or the economic spheres, Les 
Tanyuk is convinced. By signing the Russian-U.S. categorical 
demands, Kravchuk proved that he can only be a sprinter but not 
a long-distance runner in world politics. Les Tanyuk also 
believes that the absence of the mechanisms of eliminating 
nuclear weapons in the signed trilateral statement deprives 
Ukraine of any guarantees of its own security. 
  The Rukh leader stressed that the United States has again 
made a drastic mistake, as far as Russia is concerned. Even the 
outcome of the latest election did not cause the United States 
to refrain from supporting the imperial policy conducted by 
Moscow which, following the czarist and communist regimes, is 
now being revived under the banner of Zhyrynovshchyna [code of 
ideas and norms of behavior associated with Zhirinovskiy]. All 
this reminds Les Tanyuk of the events connected with the 
official recognition of the USSR by Washington in 1933, 
precisely when the famine in Ukraine, engineered by Moscow, was 
at its peak. By such dangerous actions the West is forging 
nails for its own crucifixion by Russian national chauvinism, 
Les Tanyuk emphasized.

  [Text] A session of the Green Party of Ukraine took place 
on 20 January apropos the signing of the tripartite statement by 
the presidents of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia on 
eliminating nuclear weapons in Ukraine. In particular Vitaliy 
Kononov, chairman of the party, and Sergey Kurykin, chairman of 
its political council, took part in the session. The "greens" 
evaluated favorably the document, which had been signed. "The 
agreement gives a new impulse to making external ties more 
vigorous and strengthening them, which in its turn will 
stimulate potential foreign investors to become more active, 
Vitaliy Kononov noted. The reservation lies in the fact that 
compensation for nuclear weapons in the shape of fuel for 
operational Ukrainian atomic electric power station is not 
grounds for their further development." 
  The concern of the Green Party of Ukraine is evoked by the 
conditions for processing and burying radioactive waste. 
  Regarding the proposal of the Kharkov "greens" to nominate 
Leonid Kravchuk for the Nobel Peace Prize for steps toward the 
non-nuclear status of Ukraine, Kononov replied that the Green 
Party of Ukraine is still going to examine this issue, because 
at present they do not have information about the mechanism for 
granting this prize.

  [Text] Kiev January 20 TASS -- The Antonov scientific and 
technical aircraft centre has designed a new air liner, AN-70 
transport aircraft, which is to be produced by three former 
Soviet republics -- Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan. 
  The rollout ceremony was attended by Presidents Leonid 
Kravchuk of Ukraine and Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who 
is currently on an official visit to Ukraine. 
  According to chief designer Pyotr Balabuyev, the new plane 
is 
intended for carrying cargoes and equipment by civil aviation 
and the air force. The aircraft can carry up to 30-35 tons of 
cargoes for a distance up to 4,000-5,000 km at a speed of 
750-800 km/h. The first air liners are expected to be put into 
service already in 1996. 
  Experts believe that the new aircraft can replace the 
U.S.-made C-130 Hercules and the European-made C-160 Transol 
presently used in West European countries.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 20 January the presidents of Ukraine and 
the Republic of Kazakhstan, Leonid Kravchuk and Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, signed the declaration "Contemporary World: 
Challenges and Dangers." In particular, it indicates that the 
"positive developments on the European and Asian continents are 
accompanied by the rise of new challenges and dangers. Among 
these is the aggravation of inter-ethnic conflicts, creation of 
`vacuum security' zones, attempts to destabilize new independent 
states from outside and establish `spheres of influence'." 
  The document points out that the idea of "Partnership for 
Peace" approved by the heads of the NATO member-states has a 
great positive potential. Its implementation will allow the 
expansion expand the framework of stability, peace, and trust 
among states. "We have no right to turn a blind eye to the fact 
that of late, the forces which call for the reanimation of the 
totalitarian regime have stepped up their activity," says the 
declaration. "Ukraine and Kazakhstan, which have voluntarily 
chosen the path toward a non-nuclear status, cannot but feel 
anxiety for their security. We call on all the interested 
states and governments to double their efforts geared to 
building a safer and a more stable world." 
  Also signed were a "Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation 
Between Ukraine and the Republic of Kazakhstan" and eight 
agreements which regulate mutual indebtedness, establish further 
cooperation in the space, military and industrial spheres. 
  Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk and President of 
Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev held a news conference for 
journalists at which they expressed their points of view 
concerning the priorities of the present-day policy, the 
prospects for the CIS, the security guarantees for the states 
which acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and other 
issues. In particular, Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed his wish 
to introduce a single monetary unit called "altyn" on the 
territory of the former Union and also travel cards which would 
ensure the freedom of movement on the territory of the CIS 
states. The presidents expressed their negative attitudes 
towards the institution of dual citizenship and promised to 
spare no effort to develop bilateral relations. 
  On 21 January the Kazakhstan delegation leaves for 
Dnepropetrovsk, where it will visit the "PivdenMash" [southern 
machine] plant, and for Dneprodzerzhinsk where the future mining 
engineer, Nursultan Nazarbayev, was on a practical attachment 
during the years of his studentship.

defense ministers of Ukraine and the Republic of Uzbekistan was 
held at the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Agreement on this

Cooperation. Today Uzbek Defense Minister Lieutenant General 
Rustam Akhmedov and Ukrainian Defense Minister Army General 
Vitaliy Radetskyy signed the bilateral Agreement on Military 
Cooperation. The participants in the meeting expressed

  [Text] An important event took place in Bishkek today. The 
presidents of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan signed a number of 
documents defining the prospects for the further development of 
bilateral economic relations. Our correspondent says that the 
agreement on Kyrgyzstan joining the bilateral agreement between 
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on setting up a single economic space 
is the main one. Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev had the 
following comments: 
  [Begin Akayev recording] This is what our people, our whole 
region, needs. I think that it is a very bold step which may 
serve as the start button for getting an economic union to work 
on the scale of the whole CIS. I would like to stress once 
again that this is not a regional separation today. I think 
that this is happening thanks to decisive actions by Presidents 
Karimov and Nazarbayev. Today we formed a major economic union. 
That is, first of all, a single economic space in trade. 
Second, a single economic space envisages (?a unitarian) policy 
in the sphere of currency, in the sphere of taxation, in the 
sphere of pricing and in the sphere of investments. You can 
imagine what this means -- that now, we three states will agree 
all these questions. I think that this, to a certain extent, is 
the first historic step on the path from talks to concrete 
deeds. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Communique on results of official visit to the Kyrgyz </F>
Republic by Republic of Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of President of the Kyrgyz 
Republic Askar Akayev, an official delegation from the Republic 
of Uzbekistan, headed by President Islam Karimov, was in the 
Kyrgyz Republic on 16 January. In the conversations and talks 
between the leaders of the two states, which passed in an 
atmosphere of complete mutual understanding and trust, note was 
made of the need to strengthen further friendly relations and to 
deepen interstate cooperation in all fields. 
  The presidents informed one another about the sociopolitical 
situation in their countries, and there was discussion of a 
broad range of issues of mutual interest. The sides exchanged 
views on the current situation in Central Asia, the CIS, and 
also on a number of international problems. During the talks 
note was made of the important role of the accords reached in 
January 1993 at the Tashkent meeting of heads of Central Asian 
states, which opened up major prospects in deepening 
integrational processes. The heads of both states stressed the 
particular importance of observing the principles of the 
inviolability of the existing borders between the two states, 
and spoke in support of constructive efforts in ensuring peace 
and stability in Central Asia, and primarily on sections of the 
Tajik-Afghan border. Fundamental accords were reached on the 
further expansion of mutually advantageous cooperation between 
the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and a mutual 
intention to foster the economic integration of the countries of 
the region was reaffirmed. 
  Kyrgyz President Akayev gave a high assessment of the treaty 
on creating a single economic area between the Republic of 
Kazakhstan and the Republic of Uzbekistan of 10 January 1994, 
and announced the decision of the leadership of the Kyrgyz 
Republic to join this treaty, with the consent of the sides. The 
treaty on the creation of a single economic area makes provision 
for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor on 
the territory of the states which are party to the treaty, and 
ensures coordinated credit, accounting, budget, tax, pricing, 
customs, and currency policies between them. The new decision 
to unite the economic efforts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and 
Uzbekistan makes provision for the abolition of customs 
examination of the baggage and hand luggage of citizens of these 
countries on entering and leaving their borders, and also the 
abolition of customs duties and the gradual reduction of taxes, 
duties, and other kinds of restrictions. With a view to 
simplifying the clearing of mutual payments to the national 
banks of the said countries, clearing chambers will be opened in 
the capitals, and branches in other towns of their countries, 
together with currency exchange outlets. 
  The sides noted in particular that the treaty on the 
creation 
of a single economic area is fully in line with the treaty on 
the creation of an economic union of the CIS, and represents a 
new level of economic integration among the independent states. 
  Uzbek President Islam Karimov stressed that the openness of 
the treaty on the creation of a single economic area is an 
important prerequisite for expanding mutually advantageous 
cooperation and developing the effectiveness of economic 
relations between the sovereign states. 
  The following agreements were signed between the governments 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic: on trade 
and economic cooperation for 1994; on organizing accounts in 
1994; on deepening cooperation in the field of culture, health 
care, science and education, tourism, and sports; and a protocol 
on making amendments and additions to the agreement on non-trade 
payments. 
  The sides agreed to deepen further cooperation in issues 
relating to environmental protection, and in this connection 
they made special note of the importance of the fundamental 
decisions, taken at the conference of heads of state of Central 
Asia and the Russian Federation in the town of Nukus on 11 
January 1994, on the problems of the Aral Sea and the Aral basin 
aimed at coordinating efforts and deepening cooperation in this 
sphere. During the talks an accord was reached on further 
developing the treaty and legal foundation between the two 
friendly states. 
  Rukhaniyat, the international association for fostering the 
revival of spirituality Rukhaniyat, which assessed the 
activities of Republic of Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov as 
an outstanding politician and statesman who has made a major 
contribution to the cause of establishing good-neighborly 
relations between the peoples of Central Asia, conferred on him 
a prize for peace and accord between peoples. 
  Expressing satisfaction with the results of the visit, the 
sides stressed that their constructive and fruitful talks will 
serve the further development and strengthening of the historic 
friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation between the 
peoples of the two fraternal countries.

  [Text] The chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan, 
Imamali Rakhmanov, has expressed his gratitude to the people and 
the governments of the CIS, for helping restore the republic's 
economy, destroyed by the civil war. 
  In an interview for Russia's newsmen, he said the leaders of 
the republic are seeking peace and accord between the different 
political forces, but national revival is hampered by the armed 
opposition, which continues attempts from neighboring 
Afghanistan to infiltrate deep inside the republic. And in that 
connection, Imamali Rakhmanov assessed highly the actions of the 
CIS collective peacekeeping forces stationed in Tajikistan. 
They play an important role in stabilizing the situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan border.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tajik Supreme Council Chairman I. Rakhmanov, </F>
under the "Interlocutor of the Day" rubric, by Colonel Anatoliy 
Ladin; place and date not given: "Inappropriate To Hold Talks 
on Battlefield"] 
  [Text] Calling Card 
  Imamali Sharipovich Rakhmanov was born 5 October 1952 in the 
village of Dangar in Kulyab Oblast's Dangarinskiy Rayon. He 
began his working life as an electrician at an oil mill. He 
served in the Army. He is an economist by training, graduating 
from Tajik State University in 1982. At the 16th extraordinary 
session of the Supreme Council in Khudzhand (November 1992) he 
was elected chairman of the Tajik Supreme Council. 
  [Ladin] Esteemed Emomali Sharipovich, the situation in 
Tajikistan is still complex. However, there are noticeable 
signs of a move away from a military to a peaceful life. What 
is the republic's leadership doing to speed up this process? 
  [Rakhmanov] We have been trying to secure peace and 
tranquillity from the very first days when the republic's new 
leadership was elected. Over a year has already elapsed since 
that day but there is of course still a long way to go until we 
have total tranquillity in political life as well as order in 
the economy. 
  The main thing that we have tried to achieve is to unite the 
people, channel their efforts into reviving our ravaged economy. 
In our bid to secure civil peace and harmony between the various 
political forces and public associations, we have declared an 
amnesty on three occasions. Those people who were embroiled in 
the armed struggle against the legitimate government by 
deception have been able to revert to a peaceful life. Those 
who did not want to lay down their arms have crossed the Pyandzh 
River over the border into Afghanistan. Now they are 
destabilizing the situation there, causing concern for the 
Afghan leadership. 
  [Ladin] At one time there was a great deal of talk about 
separatist sentiments among the leaders of certain regions of 
your republic. Is there a problem of disunity today between 
Tajikistan's oblasts? 
  [Rakhmanov] Some people would very much like this problem to 
materialize. I can assure you that separatist sentiments are 
not as strong in our republic as some writers are claiming. The 
central authorities have already established total mutual 
understanding with Leninabad Oblast. Admittedly, some 
difficulties have arisen in relations with Gorno-Badakhshan. 
This was attributable to the fact that some hard-line 
opposition thugs went there via the Pamir passes. They were 
afraid of taking responsibility for crimes committed in the 
south of the republic and in the capital and it paid for them to 
incite the civilian population of the autonomous oblast to 
disobey the center. What is more, the thugs blockaded the 
Dushanbe-Khorog high-mountain road, which immediately made it 
difficult to deliver economic freight to the oblast, as well as 
fuel and food. They were also able to exploit this situation.... 
  The blockade has now been lifted. A decree adopted by the 
Council of Ministers has made provision for 22 billion rubles 
[R] in early preferential credit to be allocated to the oblast. 
Aid is being provided to improve medical, trade, and transport 
services and build housing. Naturally, this is no easy matter 
since the republic's economy is in the throes of profound crisis. 
  [Ladin] But Dushanbe is nonetheless not laying down its 
arms. Nevertheless there is the opinion that the situation in 
Tajikistan can only be stabilized once and for all by political 
rather than military means. What would you say to that? 
  [Rakhmanov] The very question holds a reproof directed at 
the republic's leadership. But I cannot agree with it. We are 
forced to use force against an armed adversary. And you will 
agree that it was inappropriate to set up a negotiating table on 
the battlefield. The bloodshed had to be stopped first. Which 
was what we did in late 1992. 
  We spent the whole of last year establishing mutual 
understanding and cooperation with frightened peasants and 
wavering representatives of the intelligentsia. Had we not done 
this, today we would not have the strategic program for economic 
reform, the new draft Constitution, and a number of fundamental 
laws adopted by the parliament. All that is to the credit of 
academics, lawyers, writers, and highly-qualified specialists. 
They put their trust in us and followed us. But the time has 
now come for active political dialogue with leaders of the 
former opposition, those who did not take part in the armed 
struggle. 
  [Ladin] What is your opinion of the role played by Russia 
and the other CIS states in defending Tajikistan's independence? 
What effect is the presence of the collective peacekeeping 
forces having on the situation in the republic? 
  [Rakhmanov] I would like to pay my profound respects to the 
relatives and friends of those guys who died in the summer of 
1993 in the Russian 12th Border detail. It is hard to find 
words to express both grief and admiration for the magnitude of 
the sacrifice! We are sincerely and cordially grateful to the 
peoples and governments of all the CIS states.... 
  Regrettably, internationalist soldiers are still dying in 
armed clashes with intruders on the Tajik-Afghan border. It is 
also the task of the CIS collective peacekeeping forces in 
Tajikistan to put an end to this. It is my profound conviction 
that their very presence will have a favorable effect on the 
moral climate in the republic and on the population's mood. 
  The peacekeeping forces' mission is to stabilize the 
situation on the border. But they are performing a task of 
general significance for all the CIS peoples, in particular 
those living in the Central Asian region. 
  [Ladin] Is Tajikistan today able to set up its own armed 
forces? In your view, what are the prospects of military 
cooperation with Russia and other CIS states? 
  [Rakhmanov] The Tajik people have not made ready to fight 
anyone. There are no major troop formations stationed on our 
territory. Only the numerically "reduced" 201st Division, now a 
Russian division. We therefore found ourselves in an extremely 
difficult position when the need arose to rebuff large armed 
gangs infiltrating the border. 
  We have been creating our own people's army in a combat 
situation in the direct sense of the word. The republic's 
Supreme Council has already adopted the Laws "On Defense" and 
"On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Tajikistan." But we do 
not have enough money to perform this task. The state budget 
deficit now totals R130 billion. In view of this, even the 
upkeep of the collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan is 
today split as follows: Russia has taken on one-half of all 
expenditure associated with the collective peacekeeping forces, 
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are responsible for 15 percent a 
piece, while Kyrgyzstan and our republic are responsible for 10 
percent each. 
  [Ladin] How do you see the republic's army in the future? 
Is Tajikistan interested in recruiting officer cadres from 
other states? 
  [Rakhmanov] What have we got today? According to the 
figures of the Defense Ministry, which, incidentally, is also 
barely a year old, we have formed the Fayzal Saidov 11th Special 
Purpose Brigade, a special purpose detachment, a helicopter 
squadron, and a military hospital. There are very few Tajik 
officers. Historically a military career has not appealed to my 
compatriots. However, now it is necessary for us to train 
national military cadres. 
  The Sangak Safarov Military College has been set up in 
Dushanbe and a training brigade is being formed. A military 
lyceum on the lines of the Suvorov School is being organized in 
Khudzhand. I would like at least one-half of our army to 
comprise indigenous nationals. But that is a thing of the 
distant future. We are counting on aid from Russia, Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan, and other friendly states in training highly 
professional officer cadres, particularly in the middle-level 
and top echelons of command. 
  As for the conditions of service in our army for officers 
from other states, we will follow universally accepted 
international norms in this. But that is, I repeat, a thing of 
the future. For the time being let us say a big thank you to 
the glorious men of the Russian Federation and the other CIS 
states who are defending the southern borders of the CIS 
together with our republic's troops.

  [Text] Following a massive artillery barrage at 0600 this 
morning, Azerbaijani troops launched an offensive all along the 
Karabakh battle front: from Omar pass in the north to Goradiz 
near the Iranian border in the south. Comparatively large 
forces have been put into action near Mardakert. There, the 
Azerbaijanis are using all types of artillery, almost 20 tanks, 
and other armored cars. 
  According to reports from the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic 
Defense Army headquarters, by noon the Karabakh subunits managed 
to contain the enemy's pressure in all directions. 
  The Karabakh fighters witnessed an hour-long clash between 
two Azerbaijani battalions at the southeastern sector of the 
front this morning. The Karabakh side still has no information 
on the reason for the internal armed clash. 
  As to the situation on Armenia's borders, the relative calm 
there for the last two days was disrupted last night. Fire was 
opened on the defensive positions around Yeraskhavan and 
Sevakavan in Araratskiy Rayon from Nakhichevan at 2125 for half 
an hour. The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported 
that there were no casualties. Our border guards refrained from 
retaliating. 
  No serious incidents were recorded today in the border 
regions of the Republic.

  [Text] Yerevan, January 19 (SNARK)--Today Armenia's Defense 
Minister Serzh Sargisyan flatly refuted the information spread 
by IMA-press agency which referring to the Azerbaijani Defense 
Ministry source runs that on January 18 Armenian assault planes 
bombed the settlements of the Kazakhskiy and Kedabekskiy regions 
of Azerbaijan. 
  "Not a craft took off from airfields of Armenia even with 
training purpose that day", the defense minister told SNARK. 
Moreover, continued Sargisyan," an inspection group from Great 
Britain aiming to assess the information in the armed forces 
arrived on January 18 in Armenia and is currently inspecting 
divisions of the Armed Forces of Armenia". 
  As to Sargisyan, such news is apparently spread for the 
justification of the Azerbaijani Air Forces' recent air raids 
upon settlements of Nagorno-Karabakh. Meanwhile, the defense 
minister did not exclude the possibility of bombing Armenia, for 
such public misinformation could be used by Azerbaijan as a 
propaganda trick.

<F P=106> [Report by Correspondent Karen Topchyan under the "Armenia" </F>
rubric: "Security Officers Are Also Restructuring"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- Under an edict issued by Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, major changes have been outlined 
in the activity of the State Directorate for National Security 
[SDNS]. 
  Levon Ter-Petrosyan announced the dissolution of the 
operational services of the SDNS, the discontinuation of state 
border guard activities, and the curtailment of the operations 
carried out by the so-called security services. The president's 
edict also makes cadre changes to the SDNS leadership, namely 
appointing David Shakhnazaryan, until recently the Armenian head 
of state's former special representative at the Nagorno-Karabakh 
talks, to the post of acting chairman. 
  Aram Abramyan, the Armenian president's press secretary, 
noted in an interview with me that the SDNS's functions should 
only include intelligence and counterintelligence tasks. 
Regarding the other functions of the former KGB, Mr. Abramyan 
reminded me that the structures of this organization were 
established during the era of the Soviet Union when they served 
other purposes -- primarily the persecution of dissidents. 
Because we are currently living in a period of democratic 
changes, these tasks no longer exist and Armenia's citizens 
enjoy all freedoms, and therefore the special services should 
only carry out the functions indicated above. 
  Many observers in Yerevan have also focused attention on the 
fact that the new director of the country's special services, 
unlike his predecessor Eduard Simonyants, is a leader of the 
ruling Armenian Pan-National Movement. His appointment to this 
important post is in many ways connected with the increased 
influence of the party in the formation of the country's 
domestic and foreign policy.

of the 20 January tragedy"--read by announcer] 
  [Text] My dear ones, on the 4th anniversary of the 20 
January tragedy, which is written in our history with blood, I 
solemnly commemorate the sacred memory of the innocent victims 
of the bloody January and bow my head to our martyrs who have 
not yet been vindicated. 
  I express condolences to the Azerbaijani people and to the 
families, kin, and relatives of our sons and daughters who 
attained immortality in the struggle for our freedom, and in our 
sorrowful days I call on all of them to unite in the name of our 
martyrs. 
  Today we must stand up for our salvation and the purity of 
our spiritual world, and we have to embrace our faith and look 
to the future to save ourselves from the quagmire of tragic 
incidents. 
  In their appeals to me as president, martyrs' families and 
all the citizens of Azerbaijan ask for the speedy restoration of 
morality and justice. 
  I swear upon all our martyred sons, who have turned this 
country into a sacred homeland, and upon the unwavering dignity 
of our gloomy-eyed elderly mothers and sisters: Rest assured, 
we will stop the calamity and disaster that have befallen our 
homeland, which is now overcast by dark clouds. O, rise my 
sacred people! 
  [Signed] Geydar Aliyev

  [Text] After a massive artillery preparation approximately 
at 6:00 a.m. on January 19, the Azerbaijani forces started an 
offensive along the whole front line, namely from the Omar 
mountain pass in the north to the village of Goradiz near the 
Iranian border in the south, the press service of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh republic's press service [as received] reported 
to INTERFAX. The largest formations are being waged against the 
positions of the Karabakh army near the regional center of 
Mardakert where the Azerbaijani party used artillery, about 
twenty tanks, and other armored vehicles. 
  As of 10:00 the Karabakh forces had still managed to 
restrain 
the attack. 
  The press center also reported that on Wednesday morning 
Karabakh fighters waging hostilities near the populated center 
of Karakhanbeili in the southeastern direction witnessed a fight 
between two Azerbaijani battalions with the support of artillery 
which lasted for an hour. 
  The reasons for this armed clash in Stepanakert are still 
unknown. 
  Meanwhile, a source in Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry 
reported 
an attack of the Karabakh forces in the early morning hours of 
January 19 against the positions of the Azerbaijani army in the 
north of Nagorno-Karabakh's Mardakert region. One APC of the 
Armenian formations was destroyed during the fight. 
  On Tuesday night and Wednesday morning the fight was also 
going on in the south of Azerbaijan's Fizuli region where the 
Azerbaijani detachments still managed to rebuff attacks of the 
Karabakh fighters.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Dodidze under "Neighboring Countries" </F>
rubric: "Georgia: Come and Have Your Say"] 
  [Text] The Georgian parliament has given its assent for 
Eduard Shevardnadze to extend the state of emergency in the 
republic for a further month -- until 0000 hours 20 February. 
In the Georgian leader's opinion, another month is needed for a 
trend toward improvement in the situation to finally emerge. 
  However, many people believe that Shevardnadze wants the 
state of emergency not only to combat bandits, but also as a 
pretext for the Russian military to continue its participation 
in securing transport networks and assisting the return of the 
first wave of refugees to Abkhazia. Shevardnadze intends to 
discuss the possibility of expanding the Russian military 
presence in Georgia with Boris Yeltsin, who is planning a visit 
in early February. 
  Russian troops are currently continuing to guard railroad 
communications in western Georgia. They have been rendering 
this service for almost three months now. The local population 
look on the Russians maintaining peace with gratitude. Only one 
incident of a bandit attack on the Russian military has been 
recorded in all this time. 
  Representatives of the Georgian delegation at the Geneva 
talks report that discussions are currently underway on the form 
of Russian troops' participation in implementing the Geneva 
agreements. At the same time Boris Dyukov, first deputy 
commander of the Russian group of troops, denied rumors that 
Russian Army special purpose units are stationed near Tbilisi in 
order to establish order in Georgian cities, and that it is 
planned to relocate four divisions here from Germany. The 
military, according to Dyukov, does not yet have information 
about whether Shevardnadze has asked Yeltsin to sent additional 
military forces to Georgia. 
  In the opinion of Dzhaba Ioseliani, Yeltsin's forthcoming 
visit should finally determine Georgia's relations with Russia. 
"Either we are good neighbors, or we remain a province..."

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Simonyan: "On Shevardnadze's Decision, the </F>
State of Emergency Has Been Extended. This Time the Parliament 
Raised No Objections"] 
  [Excerpts] The latest session of the Georgian parliament 
was not marked by any particular upheavals: In a brief 
presentation Shevardnadze outlined his position on the 
expediency of the state of emergency, and, stressing that the 
emergency regime has prevented an outbreak of a full-scale civil 
war and helped accomplish successful operations to destroy 
criminal gangs, proposed that it should be extended to continue 
the struggle against banditry. The parliamentarians did not 
object, and yesterday the head of state signed a corresponding 
document. [passage omitted] 
  From time to time high-ranking officials of various services 
start talking about the need to involve the Russian Army to 
restore law and order. All this, amid a recent statement by 
parliament speaker Vakhtang Goguadze on the need to enter the 
ruble zone and also to seek assistance from the Russian Army, 
aroused a stormy protest from the opposition. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze himself made a rather vague statement on 
this score: Apparently Western expert advice should be sought 
on the issue of the ruble zone, while crime should be combated 
with our own resources. This, however, only added fuel to the 
fire. In particular Irina Sarishvili, a leader of the National 
Democratic Party and former vice premier, observed sarcastically 
that if things go on like this, soon Georgia will ask for 
ministers from Moscow to be invited to run the country. 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile on the question of additional Russian troops being 
brought into Georgia, the command of the Russian army group in 
the Transcaucasus made it clear that its position on this 
question does not play a decisive role and that everything 
depends on the Russian Defense Ministry. [passage omitted]

  [Text] It has emerged from reliable sources that a Russian 
deputy defense minister, General Kondratyev, has recently 
visited Georgia. He said that although he is regarded as an 
enemy in Georgia, his stance is the same as that of the Russian 
president and defense minister -- the territorial integrity of 
the Republic of Georgia. As for the political status of 
so-called South Ossetia, it is an internal affair of Georgia. 
  To verify this information, we turned to Giorgiy 
Karkarashvili, defense minister of the Republic of Georgia. He 
said that he does not possess such information. As for General 
Kondratyev, nobody in Georgia regards him as an enemy, the 
minister pointed out, adding that during the first talks on the 
conflict in Abkhazia General Kondratyev had a rather objective 
and sensible stance.

Dzhukov, the assistant commander of the Russian troops in 
Transcaucasia, called premature the assertions that the Russian 
troops would provide with the security of the refugees, 
returning to Abkhazia. 
  "Everything will be clear only after the meeting of Boris 
Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze", he has told SNARK today. As 
it has already been reported the Russia's president visit to 
Georgia is planned on the first fortnight of February. 
  The general also refuted the rumors that the Russian special 
purpose detachments would be located in the Tbilisi suburbs to 
maintain order in the cities of Georgia. Moreover, he told some 
units of the Russian troops are dislocated from Tbilisi and 
Kutaisi to Adjaria.

  [Text] The CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY reports that the 
press secretariat of the Georgian head of state has issued the 
following statement: 
  On 13 January this year the Independent Information Agency 
IBERIA released information alleging that the Russian Government 
had informed the Georgian authorities through unofficial 
channels that it would agree to accept Georgia into the ruble 
zone if Georgia met seven conditions. These conditions include 
relinquishing foreign assets in Russia's favor; handing over 
gold reserves to Russia or mortgaging Georgian state property 
against imported Russian rubles; allowing Russia to approve 
Georgia's state budget; and allowing Russia to appoint one of 
the vice presidents of the republic's National Bank by the 
Russian Government. 
  The press secretariat of the Georgian head of state is 
authorized to state that neither it nor the Cabinet of 
Ministers, the relevant ministries and agencies, or the head of 
state possess any documents confirming the above-mentioned 
information. 
  According to information in our possession, principles of 
the 
ruble zone formation are still being formulated. There are 
differing opinions in this regard among the Commonwealth member 
states. It should also be noted that none of the drafts being 
considered includes the conditions listed in the report released 
by IBERIA. Moreover, conditions for republics' entry into the 
ruble zone can only be decided on the basis of bilateral talks 
with individual republics. No one has had such talks with 
Georgia, which reaffirms the erroneousness of the released 
information. 
  There is an impression that certain forces are deliberately 
trying to mislead the population and use methods unacceptable in 
journalism as well as nonobjective information to prejudice 
public opinion. It is also regrettable that the newspaper 
AKHALGAZRDA IVERIELI [young Iberian] has published the 
above-mentioned information without checking it first. 
  The press secretariat of the Georgian head of state is 
authorized to state that the Independent Information Agency 
IBERIA has more than once released unchecked information like 
this. Therefore, the press secretariat believes that when 
releasing information like this, which does not contribute to 
the objective coverage of a problem, it is always necessary to 
indicate the source of the information to prevent similar 
inaccuracies.

  [Text] International experts have been in Tbilisi for 
several days now. At the invitation of the Georgian Health 
Ministry, they are to take part in a forensic examination of 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia's body. 
  According to messages published in the press, members of the 
ex-president's family categorically rule out the possibility of 
carrying out a forensic examination, and set other categorical 
conditions. 
  A SAKINFORM correspondent asked Head of State Eduard 
Shevardnadze to assess the current situation. He said: The 
will of God is involved in the birth of every person. 
Therefore, anybody's departure from this world is a regrettable 
event. This also applies to ex-Georgian president Gamsakhurdia. 
One should not talk now about who is to blame for the disasters 
that have befallen the country. As for the decision on the 
place of burial, this is an exclusive privilege of the family. 
The burial can take place in Groznyy, as demanded by the 
family. The Georgian authorities regard the request to carry 
out an international forensic examination as completely lawful, 
despite the fact that the ex-president's family opposes this. 
Of course, this can only happen after the place where the 
deceased was buried is revealed. 
  I think that any sensible person would agree, Eduard 
Shevardnadze pointed out, if I say that the cause of Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia's death should not be wrapped in mystery and people 
should know the truth. This is why it is necessary to carry out 
an examination. 
  A group is working at the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers 
which 
is entrusted with reaching agreement on these issues with Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia's wife.

  [Text] The Service for Coordinating Questions of Defense

  [Chachua]Excuse my asking you a not very tactful

  [Gogitidze] The nature of the question is clear: There is 
hunger, destruction, and poverty in the country and here we have 
one more service, one more parasite. Incidentally, this is not 
an entirely new structure. Those tasks that are today being 
entrusted to this service were previously fulfilled by different 
departments and groups; these have now been concentrated into 
one. 
  [Chachua]Crime in the republic and the capital have 
reached a peak. Can one hope that the activities of your 
department will enable the fast rising "curve" to take a 
downswing? 
  [Gogitidze] We are called upon to coordinate the work of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], the Ministry of Security 
[MB], and the Procurator's Office in the business of the 
struggle against crime and to restore law and order in the 
republic. I should point out that the leaders of these power 
structures, as they are now referred to, are professionals who 
are devoted to their job and they are sure to achieve success. 
The first serious steps aimed at strengthening law and order 
have already been taken. However, much work lies ahead. The 
wave of violence perpetrated by criminal bands could lead to the 
"Lebanonization" and "Somalization" of the situation in Georgia 
and to the establishment on its territory of the rule of the 
criminal world and the most dreadful tyranny and "bandocracy." 
  [Chachua]A boring question comes to mind here: Do you 
think that order can be established in Georgia only with the 
help of Russia? 
  [Gogitidze] I am opposed to someone else establishing order 
in our country. This is our mess and we have to clean it up 
ourselves. We have to strengthen the combat structures of the 
MVD and the MB and I am certain that, with the support of the 
public, they will cope by themselves. 
  However, I believe that we will not be able to resolve 
questions of military organizational development, the protection 
of our borders, and so forth without Russia's help. Moreover, 
Russia, as the successor to the former Soviet Union and as a 
neighboring power, which, during the last few centuries, has 
played and continues to play an important role in the life of 
Georgian society and the Georgian state, is morally obliged to 
become the guarantor of the stabilization of the situation in 
Georgia. 
  It will be very difficult to resolve the problems that have 
accumulated without recognizing and understanding the role of 
the Georgian state in the Caucasus and surrounding regions. 
Georgia is the key to the Caucasus and whoever wishes to 
acquire economic and political dominance in this region should 
recognize the value of the role played by Georgia and draw the 
appropriate conclusions. After all, it is not by chance that 
the residence of the tsar's governor- general was in Tiflis and 
that Tbilisi was the administrative center of the Transcaucasus. 
  In connection with Georgia joining the CIS, mutual relations 
with our northern neighbor are undergoing changes. The presence 
of Russian military contingents -- air force and naval bases and 
air defense units -- on the territory of Georgia is essential 
for Russia. 
  [Chachua]Do you think that we should agree to the 
temporary deployment of a limited contingent of Russian troops 
on the territory of Georgia? 
  [Gogitidze] Yes, but under the following conditions. The 
Russian side should render assistance in the organizational 
development of the Republic of Georgia Armed Forces. It is 
essential to restore or create an air defense system that will 
be used in the joint interests of both states. A start should 
be made on forming the republic's naval forces with the help of 
units and subunits of the Black Sea Fleet. The Republic of 
Georgia Air Force should start to be trained on the Russian 
Federation Air Force base. Specialists in all branches of the 
Armed Forces should be trained in military educational 
institutions in Russia and other CIS countries. The structure 
and stationing location of Russian troop units should be changed 
and also the name itself of this contingent; they should be 
given the appropriate status and all this should be legalized by 
treaties and so forth. 
  Decisive and severe measures should be taken in the sphere 
of 
guaranteeing national security, protecting borders, the struggle 
against crime, and ensuring law and order. It would be possible 
to accelerate the implementation of these measures with Russia's 
help. 
  In order to implement these measures, it is necessary to 
resolve a number of painful problems in the political sphere, 
something which is difficult without the active interference of 
Russia. However, close economic cooperation should not mean the 
violation of the sovereign rights of an independent state. 
  If Russia wishes to have an equal and reliable ally in the 
Caucasus region for a long time, with whose help it will be able 
to exert an influence upon processes taking place in the Near 
and Middle East, that is to say, if, as a world power, it does 
not wish to renounce its responsibility for the fate of the 
world, it should render assistance to Georgia in the 
aforementioned spheres.

  [Text] Tallinn, January 20 -- Despite the correction, on 
Wednesday [19 January], by the Russian officials, of Russian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Kozyrev's some statements, 
concerning the Baltic states and the CIS member states, Russia 
has not dismissed its general viewpoint on the matter, presented 
by Kozyrev, which should be a cause of anxiety to the 
international community, Raul Malk, acting head of office of the 
Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told ETA, on Thursday. 
  "Russia's view that it had `strategic interests' in relation 
to its `near abroad' and it would not give up what has been 
fought for for so much, is different from the contents of the 
declaration signed at the summit of Russia and the USA," Malk 
said, adding that this should still be a cause of anxiety for 
other countries. 
  "The world expects Russia to present an explanation as to 
its 
attitude towards other states," he stressed. At the summit of 
the USA and Russia both sides talked about the fact that no 
divisional lines should be drawn in Europe, Malk said, stressing 
that calling some states "near abroad" means in itself drawing 
divisional lines.

  [Text] The Estonian Foreign Ministry has issued a statement 
in connection with remarks made yesterday by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The Estonian Foreign Ministry is 
seriously concerned in connection with Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev's remarks contained in his speech at the conference of 
ambassadors accredited to Russia, the CIS and the Baltic states. 
Kozyrev told the ambassadors that it is in Russia's strategic 
interests to preserve a military presence in these countries. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry draws the attention of the 
Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry to the fact that 
international law does not allow for the protection of a 
country's strategic interests by way of a military presence on 
the territory of another country without that country's 
permission. Russia has taken upon itself an internationally 
recognized obligation according to Article 15 of the CSCE 
Helsinki Final Document to fully and promptly withdraw its 
troops from the Baltic states in an orderly manner. 
  Foreign Minister Kozyrev's statements make Estonia doubt as 
to whether or not Russia wishes seriously to develop a 
good-neighborly policy with the Baltic states. Estonia, in good 
faith, is holding talks with Russia so as to complete the 
process of Russian troop withdrawal as soon as possible, and is 
convinced that only adherence to the obligations made in the 
Helsinki final document will enable Russia to seriously protect 
its strategic interests. 
  The Estonian ambassador to Vienna will soon present an 
official enquiry to the CSCE security forum in connection with 
Andrey Kozyrev's remarks, as instructed by the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry, the Estonian Foreign Ministry statement notes.

  [Text] The Riigikogu [parliament] protests resolutely 
against the position taken by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev which holds that the Baltic states are within Russia's 
sphere of interest and attempts to justify the continuing 
unlawful presence of Russian military on Estonian territory. 
Such statements are in conflict with the CSCE final act of 10 
July 1992, in which Russia pledged to withdraw her troops from 
the Baltic states' territory as soon as possible. The statement 
also conflicts with interests of international security and 
peace. For this reason the regulation of all relations between 
Estonia and Russia has come to a halt. A swift and 
unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops cannot be based on 
haggling. The Riigikogu proposes to both president and 
government to protest resolutely (?against) the Russian 
Government. The statement was issued today by 30 Riigikogu 
members and handed over to the ETA [Estonian Telegraph Agency] 
by Vardo Rumessen.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 19, BNS -- Russia's recent anti-Baltic 
statements become fully understandable if viewed against the 
developments in the Russian corridors of power, Estonian 
Population Minister Peeter Olesk said at a press conference 
today. 
  "The State Duma has from the first to show itself as a 
proponent of a strong Russia," Olesk said. "The Russian 
president and government would rather avoid a sharp clash with 
the State Duma. 
  "Obviously, if Russia again begins to lay claim to the 
Baltic 
Sea, our independence gets in the way," Olesk noted. 
  The population minister admitted that some of Russia's 
latest 
anti-Baltic statements may be "purely propaganda." 
  "This, however, shouldn't mislead us," Olesk said. "It is 
not 
in the interests of the Western powers that another hotbed of 
tension emerge in Europe. 
  "In this case, they may insist that we conduct a consistent 
policy that doesn't put up the back of Russia or its citizens 
abroad." 
  Olesk said Russian officials' statement that Russia won't 
allow a security vacuum in Estonia gives cause for worry. 
  "It gives to understand, among other things, that it is 
Estonia's independence without the presence of foreign troops 
that creates a security vacuum," he said. "I don't hesitate to 
say that Moscow attaches great importance to leaving behind a 
great number of Russians to be used as a tool for interfering in 
Estonian domestic affairs and Estonia's fate. 
  "Russia needs a pretext for protecting Russians' interests 
in 
Estonia, not for protecting them in Russia," Olesk charged. 
  The minister maintained Russia's ideology is largely based 
on 
the principle of dual citizenship. 
  "If we don't know the identity of Russian citizens residing 
in Estonia, it may easily happen that those anonymous citizens 
get involved in provocations and Estonian policy acquires the 
reputation of failing to guarantee the security of Russian 
citizens," Olesk said. 
  The population minister gave top priority to the 
continuation 
of the Estonian-Russian negotiations as a means for ironing out 
problems between the two countries.

<F P=106> [From 18 January RAHVA HAAL, p 1] </F>
  [Text] Tuesday, January 18 -- Estonian-Russian dual 
citizenship would present a major threat to Estonians national 
security, Minister for Ethnic Affairs Peeter Olesk warned. 
  "The introduction of the dual citizenship is an element of 
the Russian national policy that all the leading Russian 
ideologists have been calling for. It would enable a hidden 
restoration of the former Soviet Union," Olesk warned. 
  There are approximately 41,000 Russian citizens in Estonia, 
but it is difficult to establish, whether they have dual 
citizenship, since Russia is hiding the information, Olesk said. 
If the Estonian authorities do not know who the Russian 
citizens are, Russia can always consider any act directed 
against such persons as a provocation, the minister warned. 
These persons will be used as tools in case Russia needs to 
prove violations of human rights in Estonia, Olesk predicted.

concerning a continued Russian military presence in states of 
the former Soviet Union; "These are not necessarily Estonian 
Foreign Ministry positions": "Ideas for Response to Kozyrev" -- 
received via Internet] 
  [Text] Big bully terrorizing smaller, weaker neighbors 
  Russia's image has been seriously hurt by these statements. 
The only way for Russia unambiguously to demonstrate its 
respect for Estonia's sovereignty and independence is to meet 
its international commitments, specifically by meeting the 
provisions of the July 1992 CSCE final document in which Russia 
pledged to complete the unconditional, rapid and orderly 
withdrawal of its troops from Estonian territory. 
  It is clear from these and previous Russian statements that 
Russia does not take continued Baltic independence very 
seriously. Baltic independence is viewed as a temporary 
annoyance. 
  [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev has again expressed the 
Russian policy of "eminent domain." Balts have long warned about 
the practical implications of concepts such as "near abroad," 
"special interests," "sphere of Russian interests for 
centuries." When Hitler announced his plans, the world powers 
did not take him seriously at first. The West set out on a path 
of appeasement which led to world war. Are we really doomed to 
repeat history? A bite of Baltics will not fill the bear's 
stomach -- it will merely whet his appetite. 
  Clinton has turned into Bush and Kozyrev turns out to be 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  Kozyrev: "Certain elements in those regions (CIS and 
Baltics) constitute a major threat to those (Russian) 
interests." Is Kozyrev referring to the democratically elected 
governments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania? Will we now hear 
demands for the resignation of some or all of the Baltic leaders 
to be replaced by individuals more "friendly" to Russia???? 
When have we heard things like this before?!? 
  Russia has not lived up to its international commitments and 
obligations, especially on the issue of withdrawing troops 
(Helsinki Final Document, 1992). In a form of appeasement, the 
West has not exerted enough pressure to bring this about. As a 
result, Russia, instead of behaving as a responsible partner in 
the world community, is now making expansionistic, destabilizing 
threats. 
  Clinton's message was fuzzy and seemed to allow conditions 
to 
be attached to troop withdrawal, the Russians have now been 
emboldened. 
  Russia has no real concern for the Russian-speaking 
residents 
in other nations. Those poor people are merely being used as a 
political tool. The tragic aspect to all this is that 
resentment may grow against these people since Russian threats 
will cause them to be viewed as a potential fifth column 
wherever they reside. 
  IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO MAKE RUSSIA STOP. A CLEAR, SHARP 
REACTION FROM THE WEST TO THIS LATEST MOVE WILL MAKE RUSSIA PULL 
BACK AND SAY, "NO, NO, YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE 
MEANT AT ALL."

  [Text] Prime Minister Mart Laar believes that Yegor 
Gaydar's resignation from the Russian government means "a turn 
backwards" in the reform policy pursued by Russia. 
  In his interview with Interfax the premier voiced a 
supposition that certain moods to turn away from shock therapy 
and increase state expenditures for social needs spreading in 
Russia have played a certain role here. 
  "It's a pity that shortage of funds for these purposes could 
result in the refusal of reform policy and very hard 
consequences for all Russia's neighbors, as their successes in 
economic development depend upon their eastern neighbor," 
underlined Laar. 
  "It's strange to hear optimistic statements against such a 
background stating that nothing has changed in Russia and after 
the elections everything is continuing as before," he said.

  [Text] During his unofficial visit to Estonia, Lithuanian 
Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius met with his Estonian 
counterpart, Mart Laar, in Tallinn today. 
  After the meeting was over, the Lithuanian premier told 
INTERFAX that the main goal of his visit was to look into 
Estonia's experience in the transition to local sources of fuel. 
He pointed out that his meeting with the Estonian prime 
minister focused on the expansion of bilateral cooperation and 
the preparation for the meeting of the prime ministers of the 
three Baltic states scheduled for January 19 in Jurmala. 
  Slezevicius said that the Latvian and Estonian prime 
ministers intend to put forward the question of extending the 
trilateral agreement on free trade concluded in 1993 over 
agricultural products left outside the scope of the agreement, 
consular protection of the three states' citizens abroad, etc. 
  The Lithuanian prime minister said that during his stay in 
Estonia he examined the weapons the republic purchased from 
Israel. However, he said that Lithuania did not consider 
purchasing arms as the acutest issue leaving it out of the 
agenda. 
  On Wednesday, Slezevicius and Laar will leave for the 
meeting 
of the prime ministers of the Baltic states in Jurmala.

  [Text] The Estonian Government has appointed Vaino 
Reinart, leader of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
First Bureau, as leader of the Estonian delegation to the 
Estonian-Russian interstate negotiations, INTERFAX reports. 
  As Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar reported at a press 
conference in Tallinn Tuesday [18 January], several days ago 
President Lennart Meri conferred on V. Reinart the diplomatic 
rank of special envoy, "the same as Russian delegation head 
Vasiliy Svirin." The premier noted that V. Reinart had 
previously been a member of the Estonian delegation and knows 
well the specific nature of the negotiations. 
  In conversation with an INTERFAX correspondent, M. Laar 
refuted the accusations made in Moscow by Sergey Stepashin, 
first deputy director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, that the Estonian secret services were engaged in 
intelligence work against Russia. "Estonia does not engage in 
intelligence work against Russia," the prime minister emphasized.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 18, BNS -- The Estonian parliament 
today adopted the law on the health care system with 45 votes 
for, 11 votes against and six abstentions. The law establishes 
the legal status of the country's medical institutions and the 
basis of financing of the health care system. 
  The law defines medical aid as the activity of doctors with 
a 
higher medical education to protect people's health, prolong 
their lives and improve the quality of life. Medical aid is 
arranged on three levels: general and specialized aid at the 
local government level and specialized medical aid on the 
national level. 
  A national Health Care Council is to be set up under the 
government. General administration and supervision of health 
care will be placed in the hands of the Social Affairs Ministry. 
County medical officers are going to shape the state's health 
care policy on the regional level. They will be appointed for a 
term of five years by county elders, who coordinate the 
nomination with the Social Affairs Ministry. 
  The law on the health care system takes effect on Feb. 15. 
  The legislators amended the law on the relation between the 
local and the state budgets, and continued the second reading of 
the surveillance bill. Also Jaan Luik, a member of the State 
Court, was sworn in.

  [Text] [First announcer] Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first 
deputy commander in chief of the Russian Navy, and Vladimir 
Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet, met representatives of 
the Liepaja town council and Gaidis Zeibots, commander of the 
Latvian naval forces, in Liepaja [sea port in western Latvia] 
yesterday [19 January] to discuss the timescale for the 
withdrawal of the units of the Baltic Fleet. 
  [Second announcer] Representatives of the town council put 
forward a proposal to the Russian Navy to leave Liepaja by 10 
May 1994, thus creating favorable conditions for local elections 
scheduled for 22 May. Representatives of the Russian side did 
not give any specific answer to the proposals by the local 
government, but undertook, nevertheless, to work on that issue.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 20, BNS -- Latvia received the full text 
of Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev's comments but they 
did not prompt the Foreign Ministry to alter its previous 
negative stance on the statements, Minister Georgs Andrejevs 
told BNS. 
  Latvia's response to Kozyrev's statements was not reckless 
because the full text of his speech contains the same ideas of 
continued military presence in the Baltic region as the 
ITAR-TASS news agency reported earlier. 
  The Jan. 19 statement by Baltic prime ministers also does 
not 
misconstrue Kozyrev's words in the conference of Russian 
diplomatic corps representatives. 
  Andrejevs described Kozyrev's comments as ambigous. They 
allow for various interpretations, the minister noted. 
  The Latvian Government was also troubled because the 
statement followed President Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow, 
Andrejevs said. 
  The U.S. State Department, however, demanded Russian 
clarifications on the statement "if the news accounts on 
Kozyrev's comments are accurate." 
  This leads to believe that Russia did not coordinate its 
political course with the U.S. Government, Andrejevs said. 
  State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Jan. 19 that 
Kozyrev's comments are "certainly at odds with statements by 
President Yeltsin in Moscow and certainly (are) at odds with 
things that we've been told by high officials of the Russian 
Government in our meetings in Moscow and prior to Moscow." 
  As reported, Kozyrev spoke out against a complete withdrawal 
of Russian troops from the Baltics and other former states of 
the Soviet Union because of Russia's vital interests.

  [Text] Aleksandrs Kirsteins, chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Commission of the Saeima, does not consider as a change 
in Russian foreign policy toward the Baltic states the views 
expressed by the Russian foreign minister on Tuesday regarding a 
need for Russian military presence in the republics of the 
former Soviet Union. According to Kirsteins, Kozyrev's remarks 
are only partly related to the recent visit by U.S. President 
Clinton to Moscow, because statements made by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher during his recent visit to Latvia are 
already evidence of the existence of an agreement between the 
United States and Russia that Russia should maintain a military 
presence in Latvia. 
  It has been clear for a long time that Russia will not leave 
Latvia of its own accord and that it does not wish to withdraw 
its troops from the Baltics, Kirsteins explained. He noted that 
Russia always interprets differently remarks made by its 
officials, and it is therefore necessary to receive from the 
Russian Government a more detailed explanation of Kozyrev's 
statement in the near future.

  [Text] Riga, January 19 (LETA) -- At the news conference 
the Chairman of the Latvian High Court, Gvido Zemrbo, made a 
statement on the report released by the command of the 
North-Western military groups of the Russian Army. He said that 
the President and the Latvian Government officially apologized 
to Russia for the incident on January 10, when two Russian 
generals were for several hours detained. However, the command 
of the North-Western forces ordered the use of weapons in the 
case of assault of the facilities and servicemen of the Russian 
Army, stationed on the Latvian territory. 
  Besides, Gvido Zemribo stressed that the Latvian Republic is 
an independent and democratic state, where only its laws and 
court may work. Anyone, who commits a crime on the Latvian 
territory will face the penalty provided by the criminal code of 
the Latvian Republic. If crimes would be committed by diplomats 
or other foreigners their cases will be reviewed through the 
diplomatic channels or in accordance with the mutual agreement 
between the countries. There is no such an agreement between 
Latvia and Russia, saying Russian servicemen are not subject to 
the Latvian jurisdiction. Therefore, the above mentioned deeds 
and actions by the command of the North-Western military groups 
violate Latvia's sovereignty, said Gvido Zemribo. 
  In case Russian servicemen unlawfully use weapons against 
Latvian residents, they will have to answer for their reactions 
as it is provided by the Latvian legislature. This refers both 
to those who used weapons and to those who ordered to use them. 
Moreover, such crimes will be investigated by the Latvian 
investigatory bodies and not by the Russian Military Office of 
Public Prosecutor.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F>
unidentified correspondent on 19 January; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] There were reports in the media 
about your address at the conference of CIS and Baltic 
ambassadors, in which you said that the threat to Russia comes 
from the former Soviet republics. Is that true? 
  [Kozyrev] What I said was that we face dangers from the 
former USSR territories, which is demonstrated by the bloody 
conflicts regrettably developing in some of these republics, 
where we are forced to act as intermediaries and peacekeepers. 
However, prospects are probably even better for solving many 
issues, including those connected with protection of the Russian 
and the Russian-speaking population as well as the development 
of economic, historic, cultural, and other ties. 
  [Correspondent] In other words, the media has dramatized the 
danger? 
  [Kozyrev] Well, this is shifting the emphasis somewhat, but 
I repeat that, indeed, not only the danger but also enormous 
opportunities come from those territories. This is the 
objective reality because we do have millions of refugees from 
the conflict zones, and we see these conflicts on TV every day. 
These conflicts destabilize the situation close to the Russian 
borders, and it would be strange if we did not notice it and did 
not talk about this danger. 
  Another issue is that a completely artificial campaign has 
been launched in Latvia -- and in Latvia it is on the official 
level -- and in some of the media in other Baltic countries, 
where they deliberately distort what I say, apparently so that 
they can have the opportunity to make yet another appeal for 
help and again invite sympathy from their Western partners. 
  In this respect the statement of the Latvian officials that 
they are to make an immediate appeal to Washington is very 
symptomatic. The hasty, inappropriate, and unbalanced reaction 
of the U.S. State Department representative which was not based 
on real facts -- and which I had an opportunity to point out to 
the American ambassador today -- is, of course, no less 
surprising. I do think that our partnership merits having the 
State Department spokesman get it right before criticizing 
Russia's foreign minister. 
  As for the Baltic situation, the core of the matter there is 
this: If the Baltic states want to be civilized states, perhaps 
Latvia, rather than raise this artificial and absolutely 
unfounded screaming, should concentrate on drawing up agreements 
on the conditions for withdrawal...[pauses] To have it on the 
basis of an agreement, because an agreement basis means an equal 
basis, you will not join a treaty that violates your prestige, 
sovereignty, or interests...[pauses] to build good-neighborly 
relations and to guarantee geopolitical interests. 
  Russia's special interests, Russia's special role lie in the 
fact that we are forced to bear a special, perhaps a larger, 
burden compared with our partners in the Commonwealth, in 
peace-making operations. It is Russian troops who are defending 
the common border at present. This is reflected in CIS 
documents. This is not our interpretation. This is a common 
interpretation. 
  We cannot leave Tajikistan to fate. It is impossible for us 
not to participate in the mediation efforts in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
for example. It is impossible for us not to participate in the 
mediation efforts in Georgia, for example, if we are asked to. 
  At the same time, we are not sending tanks to suppress these 
republics. That is, our special role means exactly that we are 
against extremes: either complete indifference and withdrawal, 
or just the opposite, an imperial dictate. It is a role that 
must be performed day by day, fulfilling one's responsibilities 
and respecting one's neighbors and their sovereignty, and 
strengthening the CIS. 
  This fully applies to the Baltic states. As soon as 
Lithuania demonstrated its readiness to sign a package of 
agreements with us, the relations immediately improved. The 
troops have been withdrawn, and prospects for the future are 
excellent. 
  The same applies to Latvia. As soon as an approach toward 
signing agreements prevails there, inter alia on withdrawal of 
troops and other matters, instead of these propaganda campaigns 
or recent provocative actions, Russia will be ready -- we are 
ready -- to continue, in spite of all these campaigns.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 20, Interfax-BNS -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev has termed as "strange" and "hysterical" 
the reaction by the three Baltic countries to his remarks made 
at a meeting in Moscow Tuesday [18 January]. 
  Russia has no intention to violate the sovereignty of Latvia 
in whatever way, but the withdrawal of Russian troops must take 
place in a normal and civilized manner, and according to an 
agreement, Kozyrev said. 
  "Russian troops cannot leave at once; this depends on a 
number of circumstances that are also known to the Baltic 
partners. Russia's firm objective is that the withdrawal should 
take place on a legal treaty basis -- this will also strengthen 
the sovereignty of these countries," he said. 
  The Russian foreign minister said his country was following 
a 
specific line of conduct in its relations with the former 
republics of the Soviet Union, or its so-called close abroad, 
vacillating between two extreme options: to send in tanks or 
demand fully abandoning these regions. Kozyrev said either of 
these options would lead to the repetition of the so-called 
Yugoslavia scenario on the former Soviet territories. 
  Kozyrev said the same would happen if Russia's special role 
was denied. He said that if Russian troops were pulled out from 
Tajikistan, if they abandoned their peacekeeping activity in the 
Karabakh, Ossetia and other regions of conflict, millions of 
refugees -- all of them not inevitably of Slavic origin -- would 
flood Moscow. He said this was a thing Russia couldn't let 
happen. 
  Kozyrev said the West was "not always able to understand 
these simple truths." 
  He warned that Russia was not going to remain still if the 
rights of Russian-speakers in the Baltics were violated. Saying 
that the negotiations held separately with all three Baltic 
countries on the issue of their Russian-speaking population were 
going on normally, Kozyrev mentioned that using more rigid 
measures was possible if a violation of international legal 
norms took place in the Baltics. 
  "We spoke already before Zhirinovskiy that economic 
sanctions 
might be imposed against countries which follow such a policy," 
the foreign minister said. But he also warned of the possibility 
of provocations by pro-fascist forces in Russia.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that he 
had a meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Moscow Thomas 
Pickering to discuss the statement made Tuesday by the State 
Department spokesman. Commenting on Kozyrev's remarks at a 
conference on the Russian policy towards the CIS member states 
the spokesman had not even troubled to verify the text of 
Kozyrev's statement. "What is strange is that a press secretary 
starts argument with a minister," Kozyrev said Wednesday in 
conclusion of the conference. 
  Kozyrev also described the reaction of the Baltic states as 
strange. In his view, certain political figures there used his 
remarks out of the context of the entire speech which was not 
specifically about Latvia and had a fit of "hysterics." He 
explained that he wanted the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
the Baltics to proceed on a civilized basis of bilateral 
agreements. Kozyrev emphasized that troops could not be 
withdrawn overnight. "Our Baltic partners know this very well. 
Russia will be firm about this. An orderly withdrawal in the 
framework of agreements will contribute to consolidation of the 
sovereignty of those countries," Kozyrev emphasized. 
  The minister said that the Russian government was under 
pressure from extremists demanding that tanks be sent there and 
those who wanted Russia to withdraw completely from former 
Soviet republics. In his view, each of them would lead to a 
replay of the Yugoslav scenario in what used to be the USSR. 
  He thinks that ignoring the special role played by Russia 
would also lead to a disaster. "If Russia gets out of 
Tajikistan, discontinues its peace mission in Karabakh, Ossetia 
and other trouble spots, where will the refugees move, some of 
them not Slavic at all? Where will the Tajiks, Georgians, 
Abkhazians and Ossetians go? They will go to Moscow. We cannot 
and will not allow this," Kozyrev said. 
  The minister emphasized that appropriate agreements had to 
be 
signed on the stay of Russian troops in the republics that 
needed them. 
  In his words, "our Western partners sometimes find it 
difficult to comprehend these simple truths.... They don't seem 
to understand the special role played by Russia and so panicky 
noises are made that Kozyrev calls for Russian military presence 
on foreign soil." This reminded him of the former USSR's 
diplomacy which created a bogey of an enemy and made continuous 
noise about U.S. bases. 
  Kozyrev warned that Russia would not keep silent when the 
rights of the Russian-speaking population in former Soviet 
republics were infringed on. He said that negotiations on the 
Russian speaking population were underway with the leaders of 
all former Soviet republics and added that if the international 
law was ignored and the rights of the Russian speaking 
population were violated, Russia could "take a tough line.... 
We had been saying even before Zhirinovskiy that economic 
sanctions can be imposed on states that pursue this kind of 
policy." On the other hand, he warned against yielding to 
pro-fascist forces in Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Kozyrev Did Not Demand That </F>
Troops Be Left in Latvia and Estonia"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday evening ITAR-TASS produced a sensation 
by transmitting Andrey Kozyrev's words about the need to keep a 
Russian military presence in the Baltic countries since Moscow 
has vitally important interests in that region. 
  The Baltic leaders responded instantly. The point of their 
statement cam down to the fact that Russia's viewpoint is 
unacceptable to Latvia and Estonia, which continue to insist on 
the speediest withdrawal of troops and do not want to come 
within the sphere of anyone's interests. The U.S. State 
Department has stated that it intends to appeal to the Russian 
Government for explanations and that Kozyrev's words radically 
contradict the position voiced by Boris Yeltsin during recent 
talks with Bill Clinton. 
  A few hours after the TASS report Foreign Ministry 
officials, 
answering telephone calls from Russian and foreign journalists, 
began to issue denials. According to a employee of the 
information and press department, ITAR-TASS took Kozyrev's words 
out of context and distorted their meaning: "Addressing a 
meeting with Russian ambassadors to the countries of `nearby 
foreign parts,' the minister spoke of the need to strengthen 
ties with all republics of the former USSR, including the Baltic 
states. He then turned to military issues and here there was 
talk only of CIS members. That is, his words about retaining a 
Russian military presence in the zone of vitally important 
interests in no way apply to the Baltics. That cannot be 
understood from the ITAR-TASS report: You formed the impression 
that Kozyrev had in mind all former Soviet republics." 
  The incident would seem to be exhausted. Nonetheless, many 
questions remain. Why, having learned of the annoying blunder 
which caused such a barrage of responses, did neither Kozyrev 
himself nor his press service immediately issue a resolute 
denial? The Foreign Ministry's official statement on this score 
will to all appearances be made public only at 1400 on Thursday, 
at a briefing by Grigoriy Karasin, chief of the information and 
press department. 
  By noon on 19 January the embassies of the Baltic states in 
Moscow had not yet been informed that the words ascribed to 
Kozyrev do not accord with reality. The denial was remarkably 
limp. As a result half a day was lost -- during this time 
foreign newspapers and agencies and radio and television 
broadcast many commentaries far from favorable to Russia and its 
foreign policy department and its chief.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Gavrilenko article: "Neighboring Foreign </F>
Countries Were, Are, and Remain a Zone of Russia's Vital 
Interests"] 
  [Text] Our Russian passion for proverbs and sayings is 
universally known. You will recall that even U.S. President 
Reagan was fond of impressing us by using old Russian folk 
sayings. God himself ordained that we should "stigmatize" our 
own deeds with a scathing phrase. Which is what we do. Recall 
this one: "The Russian peasant is wise after the event." First 
he does something, then he scratches his head and says: "Well, 
why did I do that...." Is he annoyed with himself? That is 
hard to say.... But is the Russian not offended when, in the 
fourth year of his state's existence, he hears the foreign 
minister saying clearly, firmly, but too late: "The CIS and 
Baltic countries are the region where Russia's paramount vital 
interests are concentrated. It is from there that the main 
threats to those interests stem." Thank you, Andrey 
Vladimirovich, for this unambiguous and definitive comment at 
the recently concluded Foreign Ministry conference on questions 
of Russia's foreign policy in neighboring foreign countries. 
  To be fair, this idea began to be expressed, albeit timidly, 
back in 1992. But nevertheless it was not unjustifiably timid 
in Russian terms. It was drowned out then by the thunder of the 
collapse of the Soviet empire, the euphoria caused by the 
acquisition of sovereignty, and the unfeigned and sincere joy of 
the fledgling Russian democracy at the appearance of a number of 
sovereign states nearby. Yes, yes, joy, because it had helped 
in the struggle of those selfsame Baltic republics against the 
Union center. This support may only have been moral but it was 
support nonetheless. But the naive expectation of requited love 
from the newly independent Balts gave way to disappointment -- 
the Soviet "occupation forces" became Russian. Forces of 
occupation, as we know, have to leave. Then people remembered 
that in this regard the Gorbachev center was not all that bad: 
It tried to set a five-year term for the "divorce" of the young 
sovereign states from their hated "master." 
  Everyone, both those who had fled from the Union and 
Russia's 
democrats, saw this as merely an attempt to preserve the empire. 
However, there was another aspect too -- the geopolitical and 
military-strategic. You only had to look back and closely 
examine the history of Russia, which has reached the Baltic 
after several centuries by blood and sweat, and then raise your 
hand to your eyes and look beyond the horizon of our 
disorganized life today to realize that the forced march from 
the Baltic must not be so rashly and humiliatingly fast. But 
what has happened has happened. We now have the added factor of 
the destabilization of the domestic political situation and 
tremendous tension within the army milieu. You may say what you 
like but it is the military man on active service or the retired 
military man who has suffered most of all -- the former is 
facing unprecedented deprivations as he settles down in Russia 
while the latter has been turned into a second-class citizen in 
the Baltic states. 
  But while punning on the subject of the times, it is 
comforting to think that they can still change. The feeling 
that Russia has no specific interests in neighboring foreign 
countries is being agonizingly replaced by the realization that 
it has a special role to play in the post-Soviet area. 
  In this regard 1992 was a crucial year. The many armed 
conflicts along Russia's borders, the infringement of Russia's 
state interests in strategically important neighboring regions, 
and finally the shameless and at times humiliating pressure on 
our fellow countrymen in neighboring foreign countries has led 
to the realization that we cannot close our eyes and ears and 
withdraw into our own Russian backyard. This is an act of 
criminal disrespect if you think of the many centuries of 
Russia's arduous history, it is a facile way to treat the 
country's future, and it is immoral toward those 25 million of 
our fellow countrymen who now find themselves separated from the 
motherland. 
  So, thank God, it seems that Russia's difficult, months-long 
progress toward an understanding of its own role in neighboring 
foreign countries is nearing the desired end. Undoubtedly there 
is still much work to be done to make the process of Russia's 
adaptation in the post-Soviet area civilized, successful, and 
worthy of a great country. But the finishing touches have been 
added, it seems, and Russia's foreign policy priorities in 
neighboring foreign countries have been listed. When speaking 
about them the Russian foreign minister remarked that "Russia 
must preserve its military presence in regions which have been 
spheres of its military interest for centuries." He added: 
"The withdrawal of all military presence from those regions is 
the same extreme approach as imperial suppression using tanks." 
In the event of withdrawal, Andrey Kozyrev is convinced, the 
"security vacuum" thus created will not always necessarily be 
filled by friendly forces. Another vital priority is the 
protection of the Russian-speaking population, our fellow 
countrymen. "To help create conditions in which Russians feel 
that they are equal citizens" -- that is how the foreign 
minister put it. 
  I think that these comments by Andrey Kozyrev will be 
understood precisely as they stand. Because attempts by anyone 
anywhere to assume the role of interpreter and organizer of 
Russian affairs in neighboring foreign countries will now be 
viewed as unfriendly acts. Russia is ceasing to do that which 
historically was inappropriate to it -- backpedalling. Russia 
is making it plain that everyone who wants to live with it in 
love and fond accord should take account of its geopolitical 
interests. Just as it is prepared to do unto others. With 
determination, dignity, and honor.

Jurmala between the prime ministers and government delegations 
of the Baltic states. The delegations are discussing issues 
related to national security, power engineering, border 
protection, customs, consular relations, trade and agriculture, 
as well as social protection. 
  [Second unidentified announcer] The delegations must agree 
on 
several fundamental issues of the creation of the Council of 
Ministers of the Baltic States and information bureaus of the 
Baltic states. 
  The prime ministers of the three countries are discussing 
the 
problems of national security and power engineering. Apart from 
that, bilateral talks are scheduled between Latvian and 
Lithuanian representatives on the construction of the Liepaja 
oil terminal as well as on the Latvian-Lithuanian sea border. 
  [First announcer] As early as on 18 January, after a meeting 
with Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, Adolfas Slezevicius, 
head of the Lithuanian Government, stated that power engineering 
was a priority direction in cooperation between the Baltic 
states. 
  Slezevicius and Laar were mainly speaking about the 
strengthening of cooperation in the sphere of power engineering, 
as well as the increasing of power engineering autonomy and the 
possibility of importing energy resources from the West.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 19, BNS -- The prime ministers of the 
Baltic states signed today agreements on strengthening the 
countries' eastern borders and on forming a Baltic peacekeeping 
battalion. 
  Latvian Premier Valdis Birkavs and his Estonian counterpart, 
Mart Laar, said at a press conference later the events of the 
last few days force the Baltic states to intensify cooperation 
in security. This was the primary topic of today's meeting in 
Jurmala near Riga. 
  Birkavs, Laar and Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius signed a joint statement condemning Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrei Kozyrev's remarks on "Russian interests" in the 
Baltic states. Kozyrev hinted that a continued Russian military 
presence is needed in the Baltics. 
  Laar said at the press conference the Baltic states stand 
firm that Russian troops must be withdrawn from Estonia and 
Latvia by the end of August. 
  The Latvian premier noted that the government heads may sign 
also an agreement on economic cooperation. Agreements on 
consular relations and on a common visa space are still under 
discussion in three-way working groups. 
  The Baltic states are expected to sign today an agreement on 
cooperation in energy, and Latvia and Lithuania will probably 
conclude a contract for building jointly a fuel terminal at 
Liepaja in Latvia.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sergey Balyutskiy: "`Return Salvo' </F>
for Setback in NATO"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- Addressing a press conference devoted to 
the Vilnius meeting of leaders of delegations from Estonia, 
Lithuania, and Latvia to the Council of Europe (the first two 
states are members, Latvia has guest status), Lithuanian 
representative A. Gritsyus stated that Lithuania will vote 
against Russia's admission to that international organization. 
According to its leader Ye. Kelam, the Estonian delegation will 
adhere to the same position. 
  As we know, some time ago Russia was refused admission to 
the 
Council of Europe [CE] because at the time it lacked a 
Constitution and democratically elected parliament. 
  "Yes, today Russia has a Constitution and a parliament. But 
they are only part of the requirements which that state must 
fulfill," A. Gritsyus believes. In his opinion, before being 
admitted to the Council of Europe Russia must also resolve its 
national and ethnic problems. In addition one of the new 
conditions set by the Baltic states is the demand that it 
publish a statement officially denouncing the USSR's aggression 
against Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in 1940. 
  The unacceptability of this latter demand for Russia -- as 
indeed, for any other state -- is obvious. Poland, for 
instance, categorically refused to include a point denouncing 
its seizure of Vilnius and the Vilnius district in 1920 in the 
treaty on friendship and cooperation between Poland and 
Lithuania, which was thus not adopted for that reason. Polish 
politicians believe that this point could be interpreted too 
freely. Does the repetition of a similar demand but this time 
against Russia not signify a kind of "return salvo" in response 
to Lithuania's unsuccessful attempt to join NATO, which Moscow 
categorically opposed? 
  The aim of these demarches is clear. It is to isolate Russia 
from the all-European peace process and to prevent it from 
taking its lawful place in the Council of Europe and other 
European structures. In the opinion of the Baltic politicians, 
the opposite course of events would, albeit obliquely, 
legitimize Russia's right to the role of guarantor of stability 
in East Europe.

executive secretary said. 
  Ivan Korotchenya told INTERFAX that the Executive

He said that because "the embassies of Turkey and Ukraine, the 
U.N. mission and the premises of some commercial structures are 
located in the Commonwealth building, the government and 
high-frequency communications systems in the building have been 
disconnected, which defies all logic." 
  "The government of Belarus has still not solved the 
accommodation problem for officials from Commonwealth countries. 
The Economic Court of the CIS is situated in an unsuitable 
place, too," Korotchenya said. 
  He expressed the hope that the future agreement between the 
Executive Secretariat and the Belarusian government would, among 
other things, make provisions for the construction of a CIS 
complex in Minsk.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, January 19 (TASS) -- The examination of 
reasons for the resignation of First Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar 
and the situation on Russia's money markets are principal topics 
in today's Russian newspapers. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent, who analyses reasons for 
Gaydar's resignation, believes that the resignation itself 
speaks volumes. It is now a question of "two basically 
different tactics of reformers. The first one is to remain in 
the government and fulfil their promises: to secure a 5-7 
percent inflation rate by the end of the year, financial 
stabilisation, a favourable investment climate, a slowdown in 
production downturn, and a gradual rise in production on a basis 
not connected with an additional emission of money." 
  "The reformers lack confidence that they will manage to 
implement this programme. Naturally, they have no desire to 
share responsibility with inflationists for economic failures. 
It means that it is essential to quit the government -- hence 
the second tactic of reformers." 
  TRUD is of the opinion that "although the government 
composition remains unknown so far, the reform-minded wing is 
rapidly dwindling. The newspaper corroborates this thought by 
maintaining that "government executives, apparently, 
increasingly incline towards cooperation with the Agrarian 
Party's parliamentary group who support Aleksandr Zaveryukha, 
and with the industrial chiefs. 
  "At any rate, Oleg Soskovets on Tuesday attended a meeting 
with regional industrialists who were summoned by Arkady Volsky, 
while Viktor Chernomyrdin gave preference to Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha and Viktor Gerashchenko over Yegor Gaydar and Boris 
Fyodorov". 
  IZVESTIYA on Yegor Gaydar's resignation: 
  "The money market reacted with panic to the chief 
monetarist's resignation". "It is obvious that the present panic 
on the money market has been caused by a government reshuffle. 
The voluntary resignation of Yegor Gaydar, who personifies the 
policy of rigid financial stabilisation, has influenced the 
money market situation most of all". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the formation of the State Duma 
committees. 
  The newspaper points out that "Andrey Kozyrev states that 
Russia's foreign policy is a presidential one. However, 
following the formation of the Duma committees, this postulate 
is not so unambiguous. At least, four of the committees can, 
and are likely to, lay claim to securing that their opinion are 
taken into account: on security, international affairs, on CIS 
affairs, and on geopolitical issues. The latter committee is 
sure to go farther in this respect than others, if only because 
it is headed by Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) representatives 
Viktor Ustinov and his deputy Mikhail Sidorov. The LDPR did not 
manifest even a hint of agreement with the Yeltsin-Kozyrev 
foreign policy course" 
  "Thus, there are all prerequisites for the shaping of a 
Duma-president opposition over his minister of foreign affairs 
on practically all foreign policy aspects". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Federation Council: 
  "Battles in the upper house of parliament lie ahead". "The 
lack of conflicts at the beginning of the federation councils's 
work led parliament analysts to conclude: The federation 
council is fully controlled by the president. 
  "However, Russian senators themselves do not think so. `The 
president simply had no occasion to get to know the true colours 
of the federation council, because the deputies themselves, 
primarily regional leaders, have no clear idea of their role in 
the upper house of parliament', a Federation Council member told 
the newspaper". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on prospects for Russian-U.S. 
cooperation in space research. 
  The newspaper points out that in the middle of December last 
year, the two main space-faring powers determined a program for 
10 U.S. space shuttle flights to the orbital complex Mir. At 
the same time U.S. astronauts are to work aboard the Mir station 
for an aggregate of about two years, "drawing on our experience 
in long- duration space expeditions. A date for the blast-off 
of a U.S space shuttle, with Russian cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev 
on board, has also been decided upon. The weeklong flight is 
scheduled for the beginning of February 1994.". 
  PRAVDA carries a statement by the leaders of some parties 
and 
public organisations "on the non-legitimate nature of the 
constitution brought up for the referendum by President Boris 
Yeltsin". 
  "The text of the constitution brought up for the referendum 
of December 12, 1993, revives an authoritarian system in the 
Russian Federation. During the holding of the referendum on the 
draft constitution, most flagrant breaches of the Russian 
Federation's 1978 constitution (with subsequent changes) and the 
1990 law on referenda were committed," the statement said. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, analysing the forthcoming transfer by 
Ukraine of all of its 2,000 nuclear weapons to Russia for 
subsequent dismantling and elimination, observes that "it is 
well known what will be the benefits of Ukraine's nuclear 
disarmament for the whole world. The 'nuclear club' will not 
expand. There will be no precedent that would enable Pakistan, 
India or Israel to join it. It is unclear, though, how will 
Russia benefit from that". 
  "For the sake of eliminating Ukrainian nuclear weapons, the 
United States assigns 60 million dollars to Russia in the form 
of an advance payment for its yet unsold uranium". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA frontpages an interview with Tajikistan 
parliament chief Emomali Rakhmanov who said: "Of course, the 
country is still far from complete tranquility in the political 
life and order in the economy. The main thing that we strove to 
do was to unite the people".

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, January 20 (ITAR-TASS) -- Many leading 
newspapers continue to discuss the resignation by First 
Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar and the aftermaths of this event. "The 
thin thread that connected the Chernomyrdin Government and 
reformers over the past months," the IZVESTIYA newspaper writes, 
"snapped after Viktor Chernomyrdin left the Kremlin following a 
six-hour tete-a-tete conversation with the president on January 
18. 
  "The premier broke this thread, vitally important for 
Russia's revival, with his own hand, dismissing Gaydar as if a 
servant and predetermining the same lot for Boris Fedorov (eds: 
finance minister). Thus, the reformist wing in the government 
has been virtually cut off. 
  "The reformer president is forced to agree with the premier 
due to the fact that he has no right to ignore the results of 
the parliamentary elections. From now on, the government of 
reforms ceased to exist in Russia." 
  In an interview with the same newspaper, Gaydar said that he 
had only one alternative: "Either to stay, using possibilities 
offered by the post of first vice-premier and at the same time 
to serve as a cover for a policy with which he disagrees, or to 
achieve complete political clarity, losing the post. 
  "Real political space for me in the cabinet considerably 
shrank over the past few weeks." According to Gaydar, "our state 
now cannot be regarded as democratic. Bureaucracy again starts 
ossifying. The departure of the state with its apparatus from 
the people again sharply intensified". 
  "After Gaydar's resignation," the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
newspaper 
writes, "another vice-premier, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov 
turned to be in the political limelight. No matter who and what 
is said, but the country's line in the credit and monetary 
policy and the fight against inflation is linked (in Russia and 
abroad) to actions of the `iron' finance minister. 
  "The appearance of a new notion in Russian political life -- 
the joining of a government in the process of reorganisation 
under definite conditions -- is linked with the name of Fedorov. 
  "These facts can be treated in different ways, but they 
cannot be dismissed. This means work in a federal body on 
conditions of a political and moral contract." 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper tries to examine reasons 
for a sharp fall of the rouble against the U.S. dollar. "The 
resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov do not exactly coincide with 
the start of the dollar's vigorous growth," the newspaper writes. 
  "However, Gaydar's resignation is nearly nothing for the 
artificially pent-up dollar. Fedorov is another pair of shoes. 
Rumours about his resignation started circulating from January 
10 when the rouble nosedived." 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper features an interview 
with 
former Russian Security Council Secretary Yuriy Skokov who 
writes: "There are no clear-cut rules of game in the field of 
economic reforms, as before. Rules are being changed every day 
without agreeing them with those who directly participate in 
these reforms. 
  "There is no reasonable programme either. If we are to speak 
about the efficiency of moves made spontaneously, we are 
skidding downward all the time, spending what was created by 
others." Skokov says that he has no aim of becoming Russian 
president "at present". 
  The same newspaper writes in anotehr article that "a turn 
for 
the better evidently set in in relations between Moscow and 
Tbilisi. This is at least the opinion of Russian Ambassador to 
Georgia Vladimir Zemskiy. 
  He says in an interview with the newspaper that the sides 
managed to turn to a dialogue and mutual tolerance from tension 
and even confrontation caused by the events at first in South 
Ossetia and then in Abkhazia. 
  According to the ambassador, the improvement of relations 
will be crowned with a visit to Tbilisi by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin scheduled for February 3-4 and the long-awaited 
signing of a treaty of friendship, good-neighbourly relations 
and cooperation. 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with 
Lieutenant-General Viktor Yesin from the Chief Staff of Russian 
Strategic Forces who writes: "The reached mutually acceptable 
understanding on non-targeting of missiles (eds: of Russia and 
the United States at each other) means for us that they will 
have `zero' flight assignment. 
  "Every-day control over nuclear vehicles of delivery will be 
exercised, proceeding from the fact that Russia, as it is 
recorded in its military doctrine, does not regard any state as 
its enemy. 
  "We shall not threaten anybody, but this does not preclude 
in 
any way a possibility under a contingency to set targets in the 
missile control systems on orders from the Russian president who 
is supreme commander-in-chief." 
  The PRAVDA newspaper runs an article by lower house member 
Viktor Shevelukha who says that the reason for the decline of 
the Russian countryside lies "in the long-standing economic 
pillage of peasants and agriculture as a whole and in the 
exaction of nearly all added value of the Gross National Product 
without its return, at least partially, to agriculture". 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper features "statement by the 
Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party", "warning of a 
new round of `witch-hunt', a drive against dissidents in some 
former Soviet republics". 
  "Former Soviet republics carry out anticommunist actions 
with 
surprising orchestration and consistency," the document says. 
"The trial of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is 
followed by trials of party members and leaders of its 
organisations."

  [Text] A plenipotentiary representative of the chairman of 
the government of the Russian Federation, head of the press 
service of the government Valentin Sergeyev said that the widely 
used formula "governmental crisis" is far-fetched in the view of 
Victor Chernomyrdin. Ministries and departments which were not 
subject to reorganization under a recent Presidential decree 
function normally. The composition of the heads of these 
ministries was not reviewed. 
  As for the new appointments, first of all in the upper 
echelons of executive power, all the candidates have been agreed 
upon between Victor Chernomyrdin and Boris Yeltsin and the 
decree on their appointments was signed on January 18, V. 
Sergeyev noted. 
  He also reported that Victor Chernomyrdin "was very 
skeptical 
about the enthusiasm of volunteers who suggested to form a new 
government or who stand up for the resignation of the present 
cabinet. There is no need to do it," V. Sergeyev quoted the 
prime minister as saying, "the government exists, it works and 
continues the course of reforms." 
  When asked about who was appointed the vice premier V. 
Sergeyev named the First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, Anatoliy Chubays and Yuriy Yarov were appointed vice 
premiers. 
  The decree of the President of the Russian Federation B. 
Yeltsin on the main appointments will be published on January 
20, said V. Sergeyev. 
  Meanwhile Interfax has learned that the decree on the 
government has not yet reached the presidential office. 
  According to some unofficial reports Boris Fedorov may 
remain 
in the position of the finance minister, while Aleksandr Shokhin 
was appointed the economics minister. 
  Other sources from the entourage of the prime minister V. 
Chernomyrdin noted in their turn that the issue of B. Fedorov's 
presence in the reorganized government had not been settled so 
far.

relating to the social protection of the population, will also 
retain their posts. This information was given in a Vesti 
telephone interview with Valentin Sergeyev, head of the 
government's press service. He declined to comment on the fate 
of Boris Fedorov. 
  However, an INTERFAX correspondent has learned that Boris 
Fedorov is to remain as finance minister, while the former 
deputy prime minister Aleksandr Shokhin will be in charge of the 
economics ministry. This afternoon Boris Fedorov stated he is 
ready to remain in the government as long as the reform policy 
is not radically altered. In the event of the reforms 
continuing, he can guarantee a reduction of inflation to five 
per cent per month by the end of the year. 
  It seems too that the fate has been decided of another 
former 
deputy prime minister, Sergey Shakhray. He has been offered the 
post of minister of ethnic affairs and regional policy. 
  So far there has been no official information about the fate 
of the power ministers. Most likely Pavel Grachev, Viktor 
Yerin, and Andrey Kozyrev will remain in their posts. 
  The head of the government's press service also stated that 
the new appointments at the top levels of executive authority 
had been agreed on yesterday at the meeting between Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and Boris Yeltsin. A presidential decree had also 
been signed yesterday and it is due to be published tomorrow. 
  The new make-up of the cabinet of ministers shows that Boris 
Yeltsin has still decided to retain the greater part of Gaydar's 
government, and it can be expected that the economic reform 
program begun two years ago will be continued. 
  According to the Russian prime minister, the government has 
throughout the past few days continued to work normally. Those 
ministries that have not been subject to a reorganization are 
engaged on routine work. 
  Preparations are under way within the government apparatus 
for an enlarged meeting of the government, which is to be held 
at the start of February. Despite what certain politicians have 
been saying about the need for the resignation of the prime 
minister and his government, Viktor Chernomyrdin stated he does 
not intend to resign and will continue his work in this post 
with the government that has been formed. 
  There is a possibility, however, that there could be some 
further consultations. Yeltsin has not yet signed the decree on 
the new composition of the government, an EKHO MOSKVY 
correspondent was told an hour ago by Vyacheslav Kostikov, the 
president's press secretary.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 20 Jan -- The processes of reform in Russia 
are irreversible -- we will not turn back or retreat from the 
reforms -- Viktor Chernomyrdin told today's news conference at 
the government press center, in answer to questions from 
journalists. He stressed that, regardless of individual 
political personalities, nothing will change in the 
implementation of economic reforms. 
  The prime minister recalled that the reforms in Russia 
continued even after 14 December 1992, when Yegor Gaydar left 
the government, and again after his return to the Cabinet in 
September 1993. They will continue irrespective of the fact 
that he has now left the government again, he assured his 
audience. 
  Journalists were, no doubt, most interested to hear about 
Boris Fedorov's future. In response to numerous questions about 
this, Chernomyrdin repeated that Fedorov's reply to the 
invitation to head the Ministry of Finance had not so far been 
received. He also noted that if the invitation were turned 
down, someone else would be found instead. 
  Journalists reminded the prime minister that recently 
Fedorov 
made his acceptance of the post of Minister of Finance 
conditional on the dismissal of Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of 
the Central Bank of Russia. In this connection, Chernomyrdin 
said that no conditions from anybody were accepted when the 
cabinet changes were made. He added that candidates for the 
chairmanship of the Central Bank of Russia had to be examined 
and endorsed by the president and parliament. For my part I see 
no reason, at the moment, why Gerashchenko should not keep his 
post, the prime minister said. 
  Touching on the fate of Ella Pamfilova, minister of social 
protection, who has submitted her resignation, Chernomyrdin said 
that: Her resignation has not been accepted. She is on ordinary 
leave at present. If she does not wish to work in the 
government, the question of who will head this ministry will be 
decided in the first 10 days of February, the head of the 
Cabinet said. 
  Speaking of the alterations in the structure of the Russian 
Government, Chernomyrdin stressed in particular that: They are 
not connected with specific individuals but are dictated by the 
tasks that at present face the Cabinet of Ministers. In order 
to raise the efficiency of the government's work, the number of 
members of the government has been reduced from 93 to 29; 
chairmen of state committees are no longer members of the 
Cabinet. The number of deputy prime ministers has been reduced 
from nine to four. 
  Replying to a question about the controversy over the 
construction of a new building for the Russian Parliament, 
Chernomyrdin said that so far the government has only taken the 
decision to study the possibility of constructing such a 
building and that no one had determined that this work would 
cost $5 million. If both chambers of parliament come out against 
the construction then it will not take place. But I support the 
position that a specialized building for parliament is 
essential, he made clear. 
  Concerning Western assistance for Russian reforms, 
Chernomyrdin acknowledged that this factor could not be ignored. 
However, Russia must count on its own efforts above all. No 
assistance will provide a cardinal solution to our problems, the 
prime minister stated.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Jan -- Boris Fedorov said at a news 
conference this evening that he refused the post of finance 
minister which had been offered to him in Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
reorganized government. 
  Fedorov based his decision on the fact that his two 
conditions had not been met: first, that Aleksandr Zaveryukha be 
removed from the government, and second, that Viktor 
Gerashchenko be released from the post of chairman of the 
Central Bank of Russia. 
  Fedorov added that his decision was also explained by his 
"disagreement with the program planned by the government."

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Boris Fedorov announced his 
resignation at a news conference today. The decision had been 
made as far back as 18 January. 
  Fedorov's disagreement in principle with the new economic 
policy of the government which is being formed at present was 
the reason for his resignation. Fedorov also finds it is 
impossible for him to stay at his post together with chairman of 
the Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko. Since the president has 
kept Gerashchenko, Fedorov has chosen to resign. 
  The ex-minister said there would be no headlong drop in the 
ruble exchange rate in the immediate future since the foundation 
of the financial policy had been laid for three months in 
advance. He predicted a worsening of the financial situation in 
April. 
  Fedorov said he did not know of any other policy in the 
conditions of market economy except monetarist, and any attempts 
to improve the industry by issuing money will only lead to 
higher inflation. 
  He sharply criticized the agreement between the Russian 
Central Bank and Belarus on the single monetary zone. He 
expressed the opinion that Russia would bear the burden of the 
decision. 
  Among his merits, Fedorov mentioned the ruble's relatively 
stable rate and an increase in the real income of the population 
by 10 percent in 1993. 
  [Begin Fedorov recording] A populist policy which, I think, 
will be chosen, threatens with the ruble rate reaching 12,000 by 
the end of the year, average inflation rates -- approximately 30 
percent and falling real living standards. At the same time 
production will still fall by about five per cent. So none of 
the indices will improve. But, as I already said in my New Year 
forecast, it is possible that the production of tanks might 
increase. [end recording] 
  Fedorov refused to name his candidate for the post of 
finance 
minister fearing that, if he named him, the latter would have 
not been appointed.

Resign As Yet"] 
  [Text] "I do not believe that the decision to build a 
parliamentary center or even the agreement on monetary union 
with Belarus can be sufficient grounds for my resignation," 
Boris Fedorov, vice premier and minister of finance, told your 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent. "I will not take this step 
until I judge government policy in the credit and monetary 
sphere to have changed so much as to constitute the end of 
reforms." 
  According to Boris Fedorov, one such indicator for him might 
be a considerable increase in the ceiling on the issue of credit 
in the first quarter of 1994. "If under pressure from all 
manner of lobbies the government issues over 10 trillion rubles 
in Central Bank credit, there can be no question of any 
financial stabilization," the minister believes. 
  In Fedorov's opinion, what is now being observed on the 
money 
market is quite natural. "We are on the verge of a change of 
economic policy and the money market is responding appropriately 
to this." 
  Boris Fedorov does not believe that he set the prime 
minister 
"deliberately unacceptable terms" in demanding that Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha and Viktor Gerashchenko be removed from government. 
"We are talking about the country's future, about what the 
government's strategic course will be, and how it will affect 
millions of Russian citizens. I can only be accountable for 
that which has been entrusted to me if I have a chance of 
influencing it."

  [Text] Renowned economist leader of the parliamentary 
faction "Yabloko" Grigoriy Yavlinskiy told Interfax today that 
"in fact, nothing has been altered, they only changed the 
posts," since Sergey Shakhray and Aleksandr Shokhin remained in 
the government. 
  Asked whether the new cabinet will change the course of 
reforms, Yavlinskiy pointed to the fact that the repetition of 
the words "course of reforms" had turned into a kind of prayer, 
"while it is impossible to talk of any course of reforms when 
inflation is back to 30% a month." 
  Leader of the Communist faction in the State Duma Gennadiy 
Zyuganov declined to comment on the decree on the government 
reshuffles. In an interview with Interfax, he pointed out that 
it was not the personal composition of the government that 
should be commented on, but rather its program of economic 
reforms which the deputies still did not know. 
  Zyuganov stressed that he insisted that Prime Minister 
Viktor 
Chernomyrdin should make a report in the parliament on his 
vision of the economic situation in the country and ways to 
surmount the crisis. 
  "Only after we see not only the actual composition of the 
government, but also hear its program, will it be possible to 
decide whether we support it or not," Zyuganov said. 
  So far, the government has been pursuing "the so-called 
Gaydar line which has gone complete bankrupt." Zyuganov pointed 
out that if the reshuffled government continued this line, "the 
economy would collapse in three or four months, and I have no 
doubts that it will be fraught with the most serious social 
turmoils."

  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin could not form a government at his own will, according 
to Petr Filippov, the head of the analytical centre of the 
presidential administration. 
  "Boris Yeltsin has to keep balance between various forces", 
he told TASS on Friday evidently meaning that the current 
government composition was a compromise of the president. 
  An adequate substitution for Boris Fedorov, who had resigned 
as the finance minister, may be his first deputy Sergey Dubinin, 
Filippov said. 
  Noted economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy would hardly be invited 
to fill in the remaining vacant post of the first deputy prime 
minister, he added. 
  "I think that Viktor Chernomyrdin will try to keep Oleg 
Soskovets as his only first deputy", Filippov said and added 
that he personally does not believe in Yavlinskiy's ability to 
reform the economy. 
  "I do not believe in the possibility of reforming economy on 
the basis of speculative schemes like the '500 days' programme", 
he explained referring to the programme which Yavlinskiy had 
offered yet to former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, but 
which was turned down.

  [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- A month after the adoption 
of the new constitution in December 1993 Russia is facing a new 
crisis. 
  The resignation of First Vice-Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar 
and 
the protracted formation of a new government signify not only a 
new crisis of power but an entirely new balance of political 
forces around President Boris Yeltsin who remains the only 
guarantor of the continuation of reform in Russia. Other 
"guarantors" have slackened their support for the president. 
  Immediately after his resignation earlier this week Gaydar 
distanced himself from the loss-making policy of Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, which, he believes, "is leading the country 
to a sharp financial destabilisation." 
  Georgiy Satarov, a senior adviser to President Yeltsin, said 
that Gaydar's Russia's Choice bloc "is assuming, in the eyes of 
the electorate, a role of the defender of the interests of 
citizens from galloping inflation." Experts and businessmen are 
unanimous in their predictions of further growth of inflation in 
the country. Their predictions seem to be coming true as the 
rouble plunged sharply against the dollar in the last two days, 
entering a free fall for the first time in months. 
  If Gaydar were concerned about the financial situation in 
the 
country, he would do everything possible to preserve the 
reformist wing of the government, of which, according to a 
high-ranking source in the Kremlin, he was repeatedly but 
obviously unsuccessfully persuaded. Therefore one cannot rule 
out the possibility that by distancing himself from the 
government Gaydar is starting his own election campaign for the 
post of Russian president. Numerous interviews by Gennadiy 
Burbulis in the last few days in which he for the first time 
criticised some presidential decisions may serve as indirect 
proof of this version. 
  But so far none of Yeltsin's supporters has offered an 
alternative reform programme of the continuation of which the 
president said at his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton 
in Moscow last week. This only goes to prove that what is 
involved is some secret goals which the Russian leaders prefer 
to keep to themselves for the time being, rather than key 
disagreements over basic approaches towards reform. 
  Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin is gaining more political weight in 
Russian politics. In August 1993, Chernomyrdin stunned the 
world by his statements concerning the disputed four Kuril 
islands claimed by Japan. The statements strongly disagreed 
with the president's position. Now, too, the premier is trying 
to steer his own course in forming a new government. He is 
likely to give one of the two posts of first vice-prime 
ministers in the new cabinet to Oleg Soskovets backed by major 
industrialists. The other post is likely to go to Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, a member of the Agrarian Party of Russia. 
  Additionally, the president of the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Arkadiy Volskiy, has denied in 
his interview with ITAR-TASS reports that he had been offered a 
post in the new government but had rejected the offer. 
  The list of candidates to the key posts in the new cabinet 
give grounds to speak about Chernomyrdin's orientation to people 
seeking to support the highly-ineffective state sector in the 
Russian economy. Considering the premier's reluctance to swap 
Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov and Central Bank Chairman 
Viktor Gerashchenko, his attitude towards continuing a tough 
monetary policy becomes more than obvious. 
  The premier's intentions will be welcomed by the agrarians, 
the communists and centrists in the Federal Assembly. With this 
in mind, one can easily foresee Chernomyrdin's intention to win 
support of the parliamentary majority and prepare for the 1996 
presidential elections. 
  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's spectacular ultimatums declared from 
television screens in which he outlines the conditions of his 
participation in the new government make one question if he 
(Yavlinskiy) himself believes in the realisability of his 
demands. They also show that he is unwilling to take risks and 
will try to remain an independent "prophet" until the new 
presidential elections. 
  The disagreements between Sergey Shakhray, leader of the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and Russia's Choice and even 
the president also reflect the prime minister's ambitious 
aspirations in his bid to win over regional elites to ensure his 
success at the future elections. 
  The activity of the four aforementioned political groupings 
show that President Yeltsin is losing his allies who seem to 
have admitted his "fatigue" and started working for their own 
political future. 
  Considering the approaching presidential elections, their 
behaviour could look natural if it were not for the danger of a 
new vacuum of power from which no one is secured even by vast 
constitutional powers of the president. As Yeltsin's Spokesman 
Vycheslav Kostimov has rightfully said, the constitution is only 
a "big promise," which may or may not be fulfilled. 
  In this situation the danger comes not so much from the 
threat of reform curtailment as from a new spiral of struggle 
for power which may seriously shake up Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Jan--There is no crisis in the 
government, it is continuing its work, and rumors of a crisis 
are far-fetched, Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Council of 
Ministers, said today. 
  Speaking at a news conference for Russian and foreign 
journalists, Chernomyrdin stressed that "the course of 
continuing and deepening reforms that was adopted in 1993 
remains unchanged, and the government will not retreat from it". 
  The head of the government said: "Crisis phenomena are 
subsiding much more slowly than was expected. January of this 
year is being marked by an exacerbation of financial problems 
and a serious acceleration of inflation". At present, the 
average weekly increase in prices is over 4 percent, and the 
volume of output is only 85 percent of the December level. 
  The prime minister said that there would be an enlarged 
session of the government sometime during the first 10 days of 
February, at which there would be detailed discussion of "what 
has been successful, what has been unsuccessful, and why and 
what needs to be done as a priority task in 1994".

  [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin announced certain changes in the tactics of 
reforms, but denied allegations that the government will 
sidetrack from market transformations completely. 
  The changes mean a switch from purely monetarist methods 
pursued by Yegor Gaydar in managing economy, however the 
government will not focus on boosting production by any means. 
  "The period of market romanticism is over now, but we will 
not permit its substitution by a fetishism of production", the 
prime minister told a press conference on Thursday. 
  But he rejected rumours about the change of the strategic 
course. "I have to tell you that rumours that this Janaury the 
course (of reforms) is changing are incorrect. I state with all 
responsibility that this is not so", Chernomyrdin said. 
  The presidential course towards a deep transformation of the 
Russian society "was, is and will be". "We have everything 
necessary for that and the main guarantors are the president and 
the Constitution", he added. 
  But "we plan a correction in the course of reforms", he said 
and explained that the correction means a switch from purely 
monetarist instruments to other measures tested in many European 
countries. 
  These measures envisage the creation of a true competition 
on 
the Russian market and in the economy between Russian and 
foreign producers. This signals "big openness of the russian 
economy to world economy", Chernomyrdin said. 
  Artificial barriers on the way of foreign goods and capitals 
to Russia will be lifted, according to the prime minister. 
  The government also plans to conclude general agreements 
with 
the trade unions and producers in order to curb inflation. The 
package of such measures is being drafted, he said. 
  But the prime minister admitted that the rouble exchange 
rate 
might continue to fall. "This is an objective and inevitable 
process. The rate will change, we will not be able to stop it 
and we do not set such a task for ourselves", he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Jan--Addressing a news conference, Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has also noted that the situation 
with the budget is the root of all problems. "We intend to pay 
the most urgent debts--to settle accounts with the military, 
industrial, and agro-industrial complexes--and to pay salaries 
to budget organizations, as well as to pay for delivery of all 
necessary goods to the North", he said. 
  Chernomyrdin said that the government expects that inflation 
will be around 15-18 percent per month during the first six 
months of this year; it will be approximately 12-14 percent per 
month during the second six months, and it will be reduced to 
8-9 percent per month by the end of this year. 
  At the same time, the head of the government stressed that 
inflation "was and will be the main problem". He said that 
"everything else depends on how we will solve this problem". 
"The rate of inflation is going at a speed opposite to that of 
the reforms". 
  The prime minister said that efforts to stabilize finances 
have been undermined by two reasons: on the one hand, by the 
structure of the economy and the structural problems that 
provoke the stagnation of investment and a production slump, and 
on the other hand by actions of the federal bodies of power that 
sometimes make promises that nobody can fulfill. 
  As for the welfare area, Chernomyrdin said it currently 
needed in-depth reforms. He noted, however, that it was 
necessary to do it without increasing inflation and through a 
rational redistribution of state resources--by closing 
inefficient producers, stimulating private investments, and 
creating new, additional jobs. 
  Chernomyrdin thinks that the fall in the ruble's exchange 
rate represents an objective and an inevitable process. "For 
several months running, we kept the ruble's exchange rate 
stable," he noted. "In the meantime, the closer correlation 
between world and domestic prices makes it necessary to tie the 
exchange rate more strictly to the level of inflation". 
  The head of government said that the new Cabinet would most 
likely modify its reform policy. He said that the modification 
would consist in the fact that within the framework of 
combatting inflation "we would move from one type of measures, 
predominantly monetarist, to non-monetarist measures tried and 
tested in numerous European countries". 
  Chernomyrdin specified that this meant, above all, the 
creation of real competition in the Russian economy. "It is, in 
fact, a measure of the market's great openness toward the world 
economy--the removal of artificial restrictions on the access of 
foreign goods and capital to Russia", he emphasized. 
  Chernomyrdin confirmed that "the presidential course toward 
in- depth and democratic reforms of the Russian society did 
continue, does continue, and will continue". The president and 
the Constitution are the main guarantors of this, he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Jan -- This year's first session of the 
new government was held today at Government House on 
Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya. Journalists were informed of 
this by Valentin Sergeyev, head of the Russian Federation's 
government press service at the end of the session, which lasted 
for an hour behind closed doors. 
  He said that questions on the organization of the work of 
the 
Cabinet of Ministers in 1994 were examined at the session. 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who chaired the session, said that the 
government would probably now meet more frequently than it did 
last year, and that the Presidium would meet perhaps twice a 
week. The prime minister is also confident that the 20 percent 
reduction in the apparatus of the government and the ministries 
will in no way affect the quality of their work; rather it will 
improve its effectiveness. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin focused particular attention in his 
speech at the session on relations between the government and 
the Federal Assembly. He stressed that "The government must 
learn to build its work with the Federation Council and the 
State Duma in a new way." "We must establish close, businesslike 
cooperation. There should be no confrontation, because we have 
common interests," he said. 
  There was also brief discussion today of the question of 
holding, possibly on 17 February, an extended session of the 
government. It is anticipated that Boris Yeltsin will take part 
and that the heads of the constituents of the Federation will be 
invited. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin also drew considerable attention to the 
fact that a number of enterprises are lying idle. He described 
this situation as one of the leading questions of today, which 
requires a government solution. Ways and means must be sought 
to assist these enterprises, which must restart and bring 
revenue to the budget. 
  Valentin Sergeyev said that the question of the minister of 
finance was not examined at today's session.

  [Text] Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, who is the leader of 
the Russian Unity and Accord group in the State Duma, told 
Interfax Wednesday afternoon that he was prepared to accept 
Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's offer to become the minister of 
nationalities and regional policy in a reorganized Russian 
government. 
  Shakhray explained: "This year is likely to see ethnic 
tensions and inter-regional conflicts and to become a serious 
test of the federation's strength. To leave the government now 
would be an easy solution. I think it is my duty to continue my 
work of maintaining Russia's unity and integrity, to prevent or 
at least minimize the dangerous consequences of such conflicts. 
What is more, I think it would not be proper for me to leave 
the government when its reform wing is weakened." 
  Shakhray said that he posed two conditions under which he 
would become the minister: making the ministry report directly 
to the prime minister and including him as minister into the 
government presidium. In his words, this was necessary in order 
to exert influence on regional policy. Shakhray was convinced 
that ethnic and regional problems had to be handled by a vice 
premier, "whatever his name is." 
  Shakhray noted that members of his parliamentary group had 
become chairmen of State Duma regional policy, local self- 
government, and CIS affairs committees. He also emphasized that 
the group held "positions to be reckoned with" in the Federation 
Council, the upper house, where Ramazan Abdulatipov, a 
co-founder of the party, had been elected deputy chairman of the 
upper house. 
  "Conditions have been created favoring constructive 
cooperation of the executive and legislative branches in dealing 
with regional matters," Shakhray emphasized.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Sergey Shakray said on 
Thursday that he had accepted the proposal to become the 
minister for national and regional affairs in the new 
government, the position he had actually held before December 12 
elections. 
  Shakhray, the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord 
parliamentary faction, also hinted at a press conference that 
Aleksandr Shokhin, a member of his party, was appointed 
economics minister to replace Yegor Gaydar who had resigned. 
  "As far as I know the decree about this has not been signed 
yet, but this will, evidently, take place today", he said. 
  Shakhray and Shokhin were both deputy premiers, but most 
evidently will lose the status in the new composition of the 
government. 
  On Wednesday a government spokesman said that Oleg Soskovets 
will be the first deputy prime minister, while Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, Yuriy Yarov and Anatoliy Chubais will be deputy 
premiers. 
  There are to be two first deputy premiers and three deputy 
premiers in the new government, according to a presidential 
decision.

  [Text] Despite the fact that the president's edict on the 
composition of the government has not yet been signed, S. 
Shakhray has already announced that he has accepted an offer to 
fill the post of minister for nationalities and regional policy 
in the new cabinet. 
  He made this statement at a press conference held on the 
morning of 20 January in the State Duma building. According to 
S. Shakhray, he is totally unperturbed at the reduction in his 
status from vice premier to "mere" minister. He sees his main 
task as being to ensure that the ministry he has been instructed 
to head works effectively. He also hinted at the possibility 
that the ministry will be directly subordinate to Chernomyrdin. 
  S. Shakhray also disclosed that, together with his party and 
Duma faction colleague A. Shokhin, he has been subjected to 
strong pressure from the PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord]. The party demanded that they remain in the government. 
If only as ministers. The PRUA leader confirmed that A. 
Shokhin has agreed to become economics minister. 
  In this connection S. Shakhray unexpectedly sharply 
criticized Ye. Gaydar's departure from the government and the 
possible departure of B. Fedorov. In particular, he stated that 
the present complex situation in Russia "is in many respects 
their handiwork." In his opinion, difficulties within the 
government, which Ye. Gaydar cited as the explanation of his 
decision to go, are objectively inevitable and it is dishonest 
to quit because of them. 
  In answering numerous questions about the consequences of 
the 
government reshuffle, S. Shakhray expressed confidence that no 
political force today will now be able to abandon reforms.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the State </F>
Committee for Federation and Nationalities Affairs, by Natalya 
Koposova: "Sergey Shakhray: I Am a Cautious Person"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Koposova] Your style in 
politics is sometimes taken as a challenge.... 
  [Shakhray] I am generally a cautious, prudent person. And 
if I act this way, it means there is a plan. Besides, I have my 
own principles. I do not think politics is a dirty business. 
It is just necessary that moves and actions should be public, 
intelligible. [passage omitted] 
  [Koposova] Do you regret your openness? 
  [Shakhray] Why should I? My answer was really honest. I 
said: "There is a time for everything." And I cited three 
conditions given which one can aspire to the presidential 
office. First, to be trusted by people. Second, to have 
political structures nominate you. Third, you must have initial 
funds for an election campaign. They singled out only one idea: 
he wants to be president. 
  [Koposova] Some observers have gathered the impression that 
you are drifting away from the president. Some, on the 
contrary, continue to see you as the "president's permanent 
representative." What is the real position? 
  [Shakhray] I do not think either are right. I set off on an 
"independent voyage" on 6 May 1992. 
  [Koposova] But while on this "independent voyage" you 
remained a "president's representative" at the Congress, at the 
Constitutional Court's CPSU hearing.... 
  [Shakhray] Nothing of the kind. I was no longer his 
representative at the Congress. The whole thing at the 
Constitutional Court was on a voluntary basis. I was not paid 
for it. I was a rank-and-file member on the Supreme Soviet 
Committee for legislation. The reason was that I cannot tell 
people no. [passage omitted] 
  [Koposova] How do you visualize the further federative 
process given the fact that not all federation components have 
voted for the Constitution? 
  [Shakhray] The Constitution was approved by citizens, not 
the components. Citizens approved it -- the Constitution is in 
force in all components of the Russian Federation. Having 
written in stone the principle of equality of components of the 
Russian Federation, the Constitution incorporated the first part 
of the Federation Treaty, namely, the sphere of delimitation of 
powers in the republics. I have said more than once that the 
Federation cannot arise overnight -- this is a complex process 
spread over many years.... 
  [Koposova] Still, you expect the republics to agree with 
these arguments and sit back? 
  [Shakhray] The year 1994 will be a year of interethnic and 
regional frictions, and conflicts -- this much is apparent to 
me. This process is unfortunately inevitable. 
  [Koposova] It is apparently in order to ease the process 
that you had an idea for setting up a news corporation. I 
realize the need. A very short time ago, the former "Ostankino" 
chiefs prevented you from going on the air.... 
  [Shakhray] I was hoping that this blocking, especially on 
television, would end as the election campaign got under way. 
But this was not to be. The hushing up continues. The news 
corporation will comprise a newspaper, a magazine, and radio and 
television devoted to the same regional and national subjects. 
It is shameful that for more than a year and a half I have been 
trying to arrange for premises for the State Committee for 
Nationalities Policy. This problem typifies the authorities' 
attitude to the nationalities and regions policy in our country. 
Moscow, Russia's capital, is unable to provide a normal 
building for personal contacts between representatives of 150 
peoples and representatives of 89 regions. 
  [Koposova] Is there any progress? 
  [Shakhray] There is. Two stories in one building have 
already been won. 
  [Koposova] How do you assess the resignations of your 
associates in the Party of Russian Unity and Accord? 
  [Shakhray] This sort of an attitude to the leaders of the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord will lead to a position where 
the party in the Duma will have to take a more wary stand toward 
drafts from the top. 
  If one is to speak seriously about coalitions in parliament, 
we will not be subsumed in some sorts of associations, but we 
are ready to cooperate with the democratic groups. Despite the 
fact that our own people continue to slight us. Even PRAVDA 
writes that the votes garnered by the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord are an appreciable gain for the democratic bloc, whereas 
our own people say that Shakhray diverted the votes. It is 
simply because we have a different program, and different voters. 
  I do not rule out the chances of interaction with Civic 
Union, the Democratic Party of Russia, even with the Communist 
Party, on a range of questions: the preserving of the Russian 
Federation, the consolidation of the Commonwealth in the sense 
of further economic and political integration, the war on crime. 
  [Koposova] The president has once again stated his intention 
to create his own party, from various democratic forces at that. 
What do you think about this idea? Will you take part? 
  [Shakhray] The party cannot consist of Russia's Choice, the 
Democratic Party of Russia, Yabloko, the Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord, etc. A party is a qualitatively different 
association. We support the president, but this does not 
indicate that we are going to be a component of his party. 
  [Koposova] Many today are analyzing mistakes of the election 
campaign. Are you going to draw lessons too? 
  [Shakhray] By all means. But this is not all. Who said the 
elections have been lost? Given today's economic situation, 
where wages are unpaid for months, the Constitution has been 
passed. And the democrats in the parliament have three times as 
many seats as in the previous one. As for our party, we cleared 
the 15-percent hurdle in 70 regions. In many republics we also 
left behind both Zhirinovskiy and Russia's Choice.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told 
journalists that he had met with President Boris Yeltsin 
Thursday and accepted the president's official offer of the 
position of economics minister in the new government. 
  Shokhin had been assured direct access to the prime 
minister. 
He will not have to report to deputy prime ministers. 
  Shokhin also said that Finance Minister Boris Fedorov was 
awaiting a reply to his conditions for staying in the government. 
  Shokhin, who had spoken with him on the telephone Thursday 
morning, believed that Fedorov could join the government if just 
one of his conditions, dismissal of Viktor Gerashchenko from 
governorship of the Central Bank, was met. Fedorov had earlier 
said that he would not stay in the government if Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha remained a deputy prime minister. 
  Shokhin thought that if Fedorov left the government, his 
duties would be taken over by one of his deputies, for example 
Sergey Dubinin, or former finance minister Vasiliy Barchuk. 
  Shokhin said that the protracted formation of a new cabinet 
was tantamount to a governmental crisis.

  [Text] "Russia's government has not been finally 
reorganized yet," Deputy Premier and a leading member of the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord, Alekander Shokhin, told 
journalists on Thursday. A decision concerning Boris Fedorov's 
remaining in the government has not been taken yet. 
  Fedorov advanced a number of conditions, largely concerning 
individual officials, for his joining the reorganized Cabinet, 
Shokhin noted. 
  "I know that the prime minister and the president have 
different views as to the possibility of meeting Fedorov's 
conditions," Shokhin said. 
  Fedorov had said he would join the government if Deputy 
Premier Aleksander Zaveryukha, responsible for agriculture, and 
the Central Bank Governor Victor Gerashchenko leave the Cabinet. 
  According to Shokhin, the candidacy of another first deputy 
premier (one of these posts has already been reserved for Oleg 
Soskovets) is under consideration now. "This job will obviously 
not remain unfilled," Shokhin said. 
  When asked whether Fedorov is likely to become the other 
first deputy premier, Shokhin said, "I don't know."

  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- "The Economics Ministry 
must be among the key bodies shaping the government's strategy 
and determining the priorities of economic reforms," Aleksandr 
Shokhin told BUSINESS-TASS after his official appointment to the 
post of economics minister of the Russian Federation. 
  "I have already obtained the government's backing to my idea 
of slightly correcting the functions of the Economics Ministry," 
the minister said. 
  In Shokhin's opinion, the Economics Ministry should be 
turned 
into a federal body, which would analyse all the economic, 
social, and political aspects of the reforms, should issue 
recommendations to other agencies, to the government, and even 
to the president, should advise them on the actions that should 
be taken at the given juncture. 
  "The ministry should discharge less functions linked with 
the 
duties of the former 'State Planning Committee', that is with 
the distribution of resources," Shokhin stressed. However, he 
noted that for the time being it would be necessary to combine 
both functions and to draw up proposals for the government's 
crediting commission. 
  As to relations with the International Monetary Fund, the 
minister said: "We would like to get from it not standard 
recommendations on financial stabilisation, but a programme 
drawn up on the basis of concrete scenarios and versions, taking 
into account the actual state of the Russian economy".

<F P=106> [Interview with former First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar by </F>
Leonid Radzikhovskiy; place and date not given: "It Was a 
Purely Political Decision. Yegor Gaydar Tells Journalist Leonid 
Radzikhovskiy Why He Resigned"] 
  [Text] [Radzikhovskiy] Yegor Timurovich, what do you 
feel? Relief? Disappointment? Concern? 
  [Gaydar] You know, all those things together, everything at 
once. It was not a spontaneous decision, certainly not an 
"outburst of emotion." It was a considered political decision. 
At the same time I naturally had doubts until the final second. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] You mentioned as reasons or, to be more 
accurate, grounds the decision on financial union with Belarus 
and the decision to allocate $500 million to construct the new 
parliament building. Was this the final straw? 
  [Gaydar] No, this was not the reason nor even the grounds, 
it was more an example or sample of the grounds, of which a 
great many had accumulated. But, of course, the problem which 
we were discussing... 
  [Radzikhovskiy] Discussing where? 
  [Gaydar] In the bureau of the "Russia's Choice" faction in 
the Duma.... That problem is far more serious. In general, the 
alternative was this: Either I could stay on, using the 
opportunities provided by the post of first vice premier but at 
the same time increasingly serving as a screen for a policy with 
which I disagree, or I could ensure total political clarity at 
the price of losing my post. In recent weeks my real political 
scope within the cabinet had shrunk drastically. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] To what do you attribute that? 
  [Gaydar] Now we are coming to the most important question. 
Ultimately the isolated resignation of a minister or group of 
ministers is what is known as a "ministerial crisis" and is 
generally of interest only to a specific group of people -- the 
political elite, diplomats, bankers, and so on. But in our case 
the situation is different. This resignation is not an episode 
of "infighting behind the scenes." I see it as a manifestation 
of very important, very serious political and, if you like, 
historical trends. Social strata in our country are now in a 
powerful state of flux. And this resignation is an outward 
manifestation of this flux. There is a perfectly clear logic 
here. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] Did it begin with your return to the 
government in September of last year? 
  [Gaydar] No, I would say that it all began earlier, last 
summer. That was when we -- a group of reformers, people with a 
clear democratic orientation -- announced the creation of the 
"Russia's Choice" movement. Strategically several things were 
clear: The authorities are experiencing an extremely grave 
crisis that they cannot resolve "from within," they need 
powerful external support and an external fillip; the ideology 
of reform is losing support among the people and it is not 
proving possible to create a really broad socioeconomic stratum 
of "reform people"; we are on the threshold of another 
"stagnation of reform" with its most dangerous features -- 
inflation, a collapse in production, and so on. All this 
provides a breeding ground and forms a "culture" for real plague 
bacteria -- for fascism in Russia. Without whipping up 
passions, I can say that it is now impossible to imagine 
anything more terrible than this. So my main aim and the aim of 
my colleagues throughout this time has been the same: to do 
everything possible to halt the process. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] Did you cope successfully with this task? 
  [Gaydar] We sought various methods of solving the problem. 
It was obvious that the power crisis was mounting far faster 
than we could build our movement. Think back: Summer and then 
the early fall of last year were a period of a real leap in 
inflation and paralysis of power. The president-Supreme Soviet 
parallelism reached its zenith. The authorities began simply to 
skid on the spot like a car, and all that the "motor" did was 
fuel inflation. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] All we were missing for total disaster was a 
mass fascist party.... 
  [Gaydar] Yes, correct. Had there been such a popular party, 
it could easily have infiltrated itself into the gap between the 
president and the Supreme Soviet and could easily have 
steamrollered the Supreme Soviet (which was absolutely morally 
prepared for this) and seized power "legitimately" or otherwise. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] And at this moment you received an offer to 
join the government. 
  [Gaydar] I could not refuse. As you know, I was perfectly 
well aware of the role of "fireman for hopeless causes" that lay 
in store for me. I was perfectly well aware of how difficult it 
would be to curb inflation -- the economic mother of fascism. 
It was obvious that once I had done my job... 
  [Radzikhovskiy] "The Moor can go"? 
  [Gaydar] At any rate that there would be forces in the 
government that would want this. But at the time I thought in 
the following terms: Urgent measures must be taken simply to 
bring about an immediate improvement in the situation. Only 
once the political process had been somehow stabilized, a degree 
of controllability at least had been created in the country, and 
the spreading blaze of inflation had been extinguished would it 
be at all possible to hold elections and prepare and accumulate 
the forces for progress. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] Which elements of this plan succeeded and 
which did not? 
  [Gaydar] Everyone can plainly see the events, and everyone 
assesses them in their own way. In my view, it did nevertheless 
prove possible to smash the dyarchy, albeit at terrible cost 
(unfortunately it was smashed rather than rectified). One 
danger disappeared. The president played the main role here, of 
course. We, my colleagues (especially B. Fedorov) and myself, 
succeeded in breaking the trends in the inflationary process. 
On this the figures speak for themselves: In August inflation 
was running at 26 percent, in September 23 percent, in October 
20 percent, in November 16 percent, and in December 13 percent. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] Fedorov said that if this trend continued, 
it would be possible to bring inflation down to 5 percent by 
March or April. 
  [Gaydar] Yes, I think this would have been entirely 
possible. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] How did you manage this? 
  [Gaydar] There is no secret here, nor any universal 
prescription. In September we immediately decided to halt the 
provision of soft loans. The mechanism is well known: 
Commercial banks and other structures receive huge sums from 
the state at low rates of interest and then either resell this 
money themselves at immeasurably higher rates or do something 
else with the "free" money and turn it to their own advantage. 
That is, thanks to soft loans billions and tens of billions of 
rubles are conjured up out of thin air, or to be more accurate 
out of the exchequer. 
  Incidentally, this does not just do economic harm. This is 
also an extremely powerful source of corruption (after all, 
these "loans" are often granted in exchange for providing 
similar "interest-free loans" to the functionary who has 
"extracted" the loans). It is also a terrible source of 
"commercial depravity." This is often ignored -- to no avail. 
When money is made "out of nothing" -- whether by playing the 
casino or "playing the exchequer" -- this corrupts business 
itself. The "honest sweat" of business is devalued. What is 
the point in engaging in really difficult, tricky, and creative 
commercial activity (including finance) if it is all so simple? 
Get a soft loan and you have already achieved commercial 
results. There is a dangerous fusion of the financial and 
bureaucratic elites here. 
  In addition, we got import subsidies ended. These subsidies 
were introduced when the ruble's exchange rate against the 
dollar was drastically understated. At the time this was 
justified. But since then the exchange rate had changed 
sharply; the purchasing power of the dollar in our market is now 
dozens of times lower than it was in 1991. Yet the import 
subsidies remained. Here the problems were the same as with the 
soft loans, there was the same "radioactive source" of 
corruption. The same ruining of the exchequer and provoking of 
inflation. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] Are these the kind of measures that are 
described as "monetarism"? 
  [Gaydar] If this is "monetarism," then what is "common 
sense"? I have long since realized that you cannot carry 
"political water" only in an "economic sieve." The elementary 
sensible, self-evident measures I have listed (and there were a 
whole series of others) are capable of halting and changing the 
process. But nevertheless they will not produce a radical 
change. There is a need for a powerful social, political will. 
If this is applied, if this bolsters a sensible economic 
policy, you get a regrouping of fundamental political forces, 
and then the crisis is soluble. But if this political will is 
lacking... 
  [Radzikhovskiy] Then what happens is what is happening? 
  [Gaydar] But political will is not the arbitrariness of an 
individual person. Under a democratic system the political will 
of the leader and government is the product of the political 
process, the product of voters' political will. No matter how 
imperfect the mechanism of universal and equal elections may be, 
it is the only method for the nonviolent resolution of social 
contradictions. In September 1993, when I joined the 
government, the plan was approximately as follows: To eliminate 
the most acute phase of the crisis through sensible economic and 
political moves; then to win the elections; to acquire powerful 
new political impetus on the basis of the elections; and, 
relying on this, to begin a new, decisively important stage in 
the reforms. I think we succeeded in carrying out the first 
part of the task. But we lost the elections. And the 
subsequent stages are stymied. Now we must pay for this. After 
the elections we lost a considerable proportion of our influence 
in the government. The government's policy began to change: 
First, many people think that the most acute stage of the 
crisis is over.... 
  [Radzikhovskiy] And that means there is no further need for 
Gaydar? 
  [Gaydar] And that means that I have no further unconditional 
moral need at any rate to remain in the government. 
  But there is one more element of decisive importance. Our 
influence has declined largely under the influence of the 
voters' verdict. We are that part of the cabinet which has put 
itself and its policy before the voters' court. Our relative 
failure at the elections largely predetermined our withdrawal. 
I would say it predetermined the rationality and expediency of 
our withdrawal. 
  And another thing. I know that there is a category of 
voters, perhaps not excessively versed in political subtleties, 
who argue more or less as follows: Yes, there is a danger of 
hyperinflation and of power moving toward imperial nationalism 
and so forth but as long as Gaydar is in the government that 
will not happen. I am far from exaggerating my own role, but 
there is that feeling among a certain part of the population. 
Gaydar in the government is a reassuring factor suggesting that 
"everything is within normal limits." So there is no longer 
this reassuring awareness. Let someone's brain start sounding 
alarm bells, that is far better than complacency. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] How do you explain the failure at the 
elections? 
  [Gaydar] I see the main reasons in the fact that so far we 
have not managed to create a powerful social class which 
consciously supports the reformist course. Enormous masses of 
people, the majority of the population, have adapted to the 
reforms, but they do not comprise the political aktiv of 
reformist policy. Enormous masses (up to 20-25 percent of the 
adult population, I believe) have started to live better and 
have been able to use the reforms, but they have not made up the 
political aktiv of a party of aware reformers. 
  It is not only a matter of the living standard. People often 
ascribe their successes to themselves personally (and rightly 
so!) and their defeats to the system, for instance excessively 
high taxes on medium and small entrepreneurs. 
  In other words: Today a new, powerful integrating political 
idea is needed. A political idea from the liberal and 
democratic camp and not Zhirinovskiy's so-called Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] What new idea are you talking about? 
  [Gaydar] I do not know how it should sound at the semantic 
level. I see its meaning approximately as follows. 
Economically, a stable society with low inflation and freedom 
and safety for economic activity. Purposeful efforts are needed 
to form a healthy middle class rooted in this land and proud of 
its country, its business, its prosperity, and its healthy 
Russian bourgeois nature. A bourgeois nature does after all 
include qualities like honesty, precision, responsibility, 
sobriety, and thrift. Economically we have done far from 
everything that is needed for that. There are means of really 
reducing taxes without creating enormous holes in the budget. 
  The new democratic idea also has another side. At present 
our state cannot be considered democratic. Once again the 
ossification of bureaucracy is taking place. Once again the 
alienation of the state and its apparatus from the people has 
been intensified. The production of new "partymobiles" and 500 
million on the construction of a palace for the Duma and so 
forth are only the tip of the iceberg, the small visible part of 
this process. And people, who are in fact democratically 
inclined, "took their revenge" for this at the elections. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] They took their revenge on "Russia's 
Choice"? 
  [Gaydar] Yes. I hope they were choosing the wrong target 
for their vengeance. But while we were in government, while we 
acted as the leaders of the "democratic nomenklatura," the 
voters were indeed unable to understand. In reality the 
"democratic nomenklatura" is to a tremendous extent a myth. The 
nomenklatura does not need to recruit the "broad masses" of 
democratic politicians and even demagogues. The nomenklatura 
largely remains as it was before. It has drawn back very 
slightly and swallowed up the "best" democratic cadres, absorbed 
them, and returned to its initial position. "The Neva was 
clothed in granite." 
  There is an ethical and a political aspect here. If 
everything is clear ethically -- the "stone fundament of 
bureaucracy" is again outweighing the head of democracy -- then 
this does after all lead to political consequences. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] The alliance of bureaucracy and corrupt 
capital under cover of fascist demagogy? 
  [Gaydar] Absolutely right. That is the closed, rotten, 
truly "Weimar" atmosphere in which the terrible homunculi of 
fascism are born. If democrats today have no powerful new idea, 
those people always have an idea ready -- the idea of national 
grievance, national arrogance, a national inferiority complex 
reaching hysterical imperial proportions. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] An ever-living and ever youthful idea. 
  [Gaydar] But how to draw a clear boundary between national 
dignity and national hysteria? That is the question. I believe 
we must be the party of Russian national dignity -- the dignity 
of the Russian man's intelligence. A new state purge is a purge 
of bureaucratic arrogance, of bureaucratic cruelty and 
corruption, free enterprise, the opportunity for honest, 
dignified life and labor -- that is what a Russian resurrection 
is. We must explain that the resurrection of hatred is the 
resurrection of scoundrels, adventurists, and aggressors. That 
is the "Russophobia" they seek everywhere except in the mirror. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] And you need a free hand to build such a 
party? 
  [Gaydar] Unless the democratic movement is consolidated, the 
slide toward fascism about which we were speaking will become 
reality. Palace intrigues, corruption, populism, and 
saber-rattling combine here. A terrible cocktail! If it is 
used to poison the people there will be a real catastrophe which 
all the horror which Russia has experienced will pale beside. I 
know that this cannot be stopped either by bureaucratic methods 
or by purely economic edicts or by parliamentary fighting. We 
must use all these methods but the main thing nonetheless is a 
mass-based democratic movement. A party. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] And this party's attitude toward the 
president? 
  [Gaydar] We support the president. We must return the 
president's link with the people, return Yeltsin to Yeltsin, if 
you like. The president has been strong through his openness to 
the broad masses of society. That must be restored. 
  [Radzikhovskiy] Yegor Timurovich, but do you see yourself as 
a "pure" politician and as a leader and creator of a party? The 
squabbling, the minor and petty ambitions, the empty talk -- 
will you withstand all this inevitable prosaic aspect of party 
life? 
  [Gaydar] We are only beginning and you are already 
frightening me.... As long as I have a sensible goal and 
understand that we are not wasting our efforts, that we are 
doing what I believe in, albeit slowly, albeit in zigzags, then, 
of course, I shall pull this cart as best I can.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1900 GMT on 16 January, during the 
scheduled "Sunday" news feature program, carries a 3-minute 
report on the Russian Cosmonauts recently returned to earth. 
  The report opens with a shot of Russian cosmonauts Aleksandr 
Serebrov and Vasiliy Tsebliyev being picked up in a snow-covered 
field, still in their space suits, and pans to a tent in the 
fields, and finally to doctors checking the cosmonauts. 
  Correspondent Sergey Slichenko reports that news about 
problems with spacecraft docking came one-and-half hours before 
the landing of the crew. The landing was not without problems 
either: the crew was found about 100 kilometers off the target 
area. 
  A tent was erected in the middle of the snow-covered fields 
where the two men landed, and it is in this tent that they spoke 
to the correspondent while the doctors checked their physical 
condition. 
  Cosmonaut Serebrov, looking pale and exhausted, comments on 
the significance of Inca launching sites, while Cosmonaut 
Tsebliyev says that during the 197 days of the mission he and 
Serebrov did not have a single quarrel. 
  The correspondent then describes the technical problem the 
two cosmonauts encountered during their mission. He says that 
"the cosmonauts' last task was to photograph the docking point, 
where the Americans will have to dock their shuttle. The 
spacecraft left the space station, started circling it, and at 
that moment Tsebliyev and Serebrov felt a thump, and it seemed 
to them that they had bumped into the station. 
  "However, the crew of the Mir station did not feel anything 
and according to their reports everything was fine there. 
Experts at the space center are now analyzing the information 
to determine whether there had been an accident and whether the 
space station had been moved. 
  "However, this incident may turn out to be very useful. The 
Russian spacecraft is considerably lighter than the American 
shuttle and if the American shuttle were to bump into the space 
station, this could have serious consequences. Now Russian 
scientists have an opportunity to study such an eventuality, 
even though they'll have to do so with a real situation, rather 
than a theoretical one."

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- Describing an incident 
that took place after the undocking of the Soyuz TM-17 spaceship 
and the Mir space station on Friday [14 January], Aleksandr 
Serebrov told a news conference on Monday: "We circled the 
station, touched it and flew away". 
  Specialists confirmed that, indeed, the spaceship with 
Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov aboard touched the Mir 
station. However, it is too early to speak about causes and 
consequences of the incident. 
  Some experts believe that the programme of the 15th main 
expedition (Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy 
Polyakov) which relieved Tsibliev and Serebrov at the Mir 
station, will be somewhat changed. 
  Their plan of work did not provide for space walks. However, 
it will be necessary to do them now. 
  Nevertheless, according to the cosmonauts who ended their 
mission on Friday, the Mir station is in good condition. 
Although the station launched in 1986 was to end its service 
life five years later, it will function normally till 1997 
according to experts' estimates. Tsibliev stressed that for 
this purpose it is necessary to take permanently preventive 
measures. 
  The cosmonauts safely returned to the earth and, judging by 
their statements, feel well. Some inconvenience is only caused 
by muscles which did not function under zero-gravity conditions, 
and which are forced "to work" now. 
  Tsibliev and Serebrov are satisfied with the fully completed 
programme of the expedition. As for explorations and 
experiments conducted on a commercial basis, they, according to 
Serebrov, "are evidently profitable". True, cosmonauts do not 
participate in signing such contracts, he admitted.

  [Text] Cosmonauts Vassiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov 
did not express any doubt about the operability of the Russian 
orbital station Mir upon their return to the Earth. At the 
press-conference devoted to the results of the work at the 
station within the 14th main expedition they confirmed that the 
station maintains the normal operative conditions after a minor 
collision with the shell of the Soyuz TM-17 landing vehicle 
which happened last week. 
  "The information on what has happened will be analyzed by a 
special technical commission which will make the necessary 
conclusions about the possible consequences of the collision," 
the flight engineer of the expedition A. Serebrov told the 
journalists. 
  Assessing the general possibility of further fulfillment of 
complex experiments on board the station both cosmonauts said 
that "such an opportunity exists, including for the launching 
into orbit of the first functional blocks of the future station 
created in the framework of the Alpha project of international 
cooperation." In the view of A. Serebrov the only condition of 
the normal operation of the station is the "timely performance 
of prophylactics so that the resource of the equipment is always 
within the technical requirements."

  [Text] Mission Control Centre January 18 TASS -- Viktor 
Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev and Valeriy Polyakov worked for nine 
days during a flight on board Mir space station. 
  Medical experiments held an important place in the flight 
programme this week. Their purpose was to study the adaptation 
of the human organism to orbital flight and to assess the 
effects of weightlessness on psychophysiological reactions and 
work of cosmanauts. 
  The ultrasonic method was used on Tuesday to determine the 
characteristics of the functioning of the heart and blood 
circulation in vessels of internal organs. During the day the 
physician will undergo a similar check with the use of means for 
the prevention of unfavourable effects of weightlessness on the 
human organism. 
  The flight proceeds according to schedule. All the three 
cosmonauts are in good health and feel well.

  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- Tests of an automatic 
cargo spaceship "Progress M-17" continue. On August 11, 1993, 
the cargo spaceship was disconnected from the orbital complex 
"Mir" and since then it had been performing an independent space 
flight. 
  The parameters of the cargo spaceship, reported by the Space 
mission Control Centre, are as follows: 
  -- the maximum distance from the earth - 333 kilometers; 
  -- the minimum distance from the earth - 231 kilometers; 
  -- the period of revolution - 90 minutes; 
  -- inclination - 51.6 degrees 
  All systems on board are operating normally. Information 
transmitted to the earth is being processed and analysed. 
According to the ballistic provision department of the Space 
Mission Control Centre, the cargo spaceship is expected to enter 
thick layers of the atmosphere at the end of February - 
beginning of March, 1994.

  [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- Military space forces of 
Russia plan to launch the first direct television relay space 
apparatus "Gals" from the "Baykonur" (Kazakhstan) space vehicle 
launching site today. 
  Satellite "Gals", designed at the scientific production 
amalgam of applied mechanics (Krasnoyarsk-26 city), is the new 
generation of tv relay satellites. This launch will pave the 
way to the creation of a new television satellite system of five 
similar space apparatuses. 
  The satellite is equipped with a three-mast onboard relay- 
transmitter, ensuring retransmission of regional television 
programmes through small dimension 90 cm. diameter individual 
receiving antennas. The space apparatus will be put into a near 
geo-stationary orbit of 90 degrees eastern longitude 
approximately seven hours after the blast off (scheduled for 
12:53 hours Moscow time). Later it will be manouvered to a 
stationary position of 44 degrees eastern longitude, where it 
will be used for the main purpose it is meant for. 
  "Gals" will be the first automatic satellite to be launched 
by the military space forces of Russia from the Baykonur 
cosmodrome in 1994.

  [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- The Russian space military 
forces launched the first TV satellite called "Gals" with a 
"Proton" three-stage booster-rocket from the Baykonur 
Cosmodrome on Thursday at 12:49, Moscow time. ITAR-TASS learnt 
at the press centre of the space military forces that the 
launching was successful. 
  The satellite was developed by the applied mechanics 
scientific and production amalgamation (Krasnoyarsk-26) under 
the guidance of chief designer and general manager Mikhail 
Reshetnev. 
  The launching pioneers a system of direct space TV 
broadcasting, which will consist of five "Gals" satellites, for 
all information space of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  The satellite is equipped with a three-segment onboard relay 
which will ensure for the first time the reception of regional 
TV broadcasting with small-size individual antennae with a 
diameter 0.6-0.9 meters over individual Russian regions. The 
satellite weighs 2.5 tonnes and will operate for five or seven 
years in orbit. 
  The satellite will be put into orbit close to geostationary 
at a point 90 degrees of eastern longitude some seven hours 
after the launching. Following this, it will be brought to the 
point of "stationing" 44 degrees eastern longitude where it will 
be used for the assigned mission. 
  The "Gals" satellite is the first unmanned spacecraft 
blasted 
off by Russia this year.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "Cosmonauts Back From Mir Are </F>
More Concerned About the Situation in the Country Than in 
Cosmonautics"] 
  [Text] Cosmonauts Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr 
Serebrov, who landed 14 January, spent two and a half months 
longer in orbit than originally planned. It was therefore 
natural that journalists at a meeting in Zvezdnyy Gorodok 
attempted to tease out all the details of how the cosmonauts 
feel. There was no hint of the slightest complaint, and 
immediately after the news conference Aleksandr Serebrov went 
off for another swim in the sports pool. 
  Incidentally, this was 50-year-old Serebrov's fourth flight 
already, and two of the expeditions turned out to be lengthy. 
He now has several world records to his credit, the most 
impressive being 10 space walks. One of these -- when the 
orbital station was carefully examined from all sides during the 
"Panorama" scientific experiment -- gave grounds for assuming 
that Mir will "survive" until the joint missions with the 
Americans in 1997. 
  Even this time, incidentally, Serebrov and Tsibliyev 
conducted experiments in growing biological crystals under a 
commercial order from the American firms Boeing and Payload. As 
a check back on Earth has shown, the crystals obtained are of a 
distinctly high quality. By the way, there should be no 
delusions about the scientific intensity of the expedition. 
Crews, including this one, have to spend a considerable 
proportion of their time on preventive work -- essentially 
do-it-yourself jobs. Therefore, it seemed to me, Serebrov is 
somewhat skeptical about the idea of a fifth flight, which, on 
the one hand, would enable him to become undisputed 
record-holder but, on the other, would be of little interest to 
a specialist in the current situation. 
  But we do have an achievement for the Guinness Book of 
Records. Serebrov conducted studies involving a 
microaccelerometer and thereby, in orbit, helped his latest 
terrestrial research student, Yelena Bogdanova from the 
"Energiya" Science-and-Production Association, in her 
preparation to defend her dissertation. 
  This flight was also unusual in that the crew's relationship 
with Mission Control Center was contract-based. In the event of 
a mistake either side would have had to repay up to 30 percent 
of the cost of the spoiled segment of work. Any change of 
program proposed by Mission Control Center required legal 
coordination with the crew's agents on Earth. It did not get to 
the point of financial penalties during this expedition, but 
there were a dozen instances when an official document was 
written at Mission Control Center to broaden the crew's 
functions and exempt them from any claim in the event of any 
kind of failure. Serebrov and Tsibliyev are unanimous that the 
contract system is still rough and and imperfect but that even 
in this form it imposes a discipline and is a great help in work. 
  The cosmonauts' were pretty pessimistic in their assessment 
of the situation in the country which they left more than six 
months ago, saying that nothing has changed here since Gogol's 
time. Gaydar's exit from the government provoked particularly 
gloomy thoughts among the cosmonauts. 
  On the way to the swimming pool I managed to get a word with 
Aleksandr Serebrov on a delicate matter -- the recent pre-launch 
conflict between cosmonaut physicians Valeriy Polyakov and 
German Arzamazov. Serebrov noted that their relationship is a 
precise repetition of the theme of "Two Captains" [Dva Kapitana; 
1944 Veniamin Kaverin novel paralleling the lives and conflicts 
of a pre-revolutionary explorer and a young Soviet airman]. The 
most curious thing is that just before the replacement team 
arrived Serebrov, without having any information from Earth, 
predicted a probable clash between the contenders for a record 
one and one-half year flight. 
  Incidentally, it is premature to make final judgments in 
this 
unpleasant episode. After our first item the "troublemaker" 
German Arzamazov contacted the editorial office. His story 
differs from the official version. Incidentally, Serebrov's 
astonishing prediction testifies that what happened cannot be 
described as a nervous breakdown, as it is being depicted.

  [Text] Chisinau, 19 Jan -- The authorities of the Dniester 
Republic introduced the state of economic emergency 
[chrezvychaynoye ekonomicheskoye polozheniye] "in order to 
justify repression against the people who have run out of 
patience with the corrupt and criminal leadership," Mikhail 
Bergman, military commandant of the Dniester Republic, said 
today. Together with Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Lebed, 
commander of the 14th Russian Army, he is known recently for 
having accused the leaders of the Dniester Republic of 
"untalented leadership" and for having urged citizens to demand 
their resignation. 
  Mikhail Bergman noted that the decree by Igor Smirnov, 
president of the Dniester Moldavian Republic, says nothing about 
the collapse of the economy or steps to overcome it. However, 
the population is being prohibited from holding mass 
demonstrations and the press is being instructed strictly to 
cover only government activity. Failure to implement this decree 
will result in the dismissal of heads of state enterprises and 
organizations and the immediate shutting down of private 
enterprises. 
  Mikhail Bergman also said that the leaders of the Dniester 
Republic "deliberately refused to compromise in the talks with 
Chisinau and to regulate currency circulation with other 
republics". As a result, former Soviet rubles still in 
circulation have flooded in from all over the former Soviet 
Union. Runaway inflation has brought the economy to 
catastrophe, Bergman stressed in conclusion.

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 19/1/1994 -- From our special 
correspondent: Dniester Republic President Igor Smirnov blamed 
today the Moldovan leadership of imposing an economic blockade 
on the Dniester region, in particular that Moldova annulled the 
discounts between banks. In his speech during the session of the 
Dniester Supreme Soviet, Smirnov said that Moldova owed Tiraspol 
30 billion rubles for electricity supplied from Dniester. At 
the same time, the fees for licenses for external economic 
activity of the Dniester enterprises are transferred into 
Moldova's budget. The Dniester authorities intend to compel the 
enterprises in the Dniester Republic to register again. Now all 
taxes for licenses and other payments will be transferred in the 
budget of the self- proclaimed republic. According to Smirnov, 
the Dniester enterprises have transferred in Moldova's budget 
for the obtained licenses 85 billion rubles. Igor Smirnov also 
established by a decree customs duty for transiting goods on 
Dniester territory. According to that decree, for every truck 
with a cargo a $30 transit tax will be paid. The decree does not 
refer to transport means belonging to Russia, Ukraine, and 
Belarus.

  [Text] Moldovan Prime Minister Andre Sangheli said at a 
news conference in Chisinau Thursday that the leaders of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic are threatening to cut off the 
gas and energy supply to the western bank of the Dniester. He 
talked with the Tiraspol leaders on the telephone Thursday in an 
attempt to avoid this development. 
  He did not think that there were good reasons for cutting 
off 
the gas supply. 
  Sangheli said that Tiraspol wanted to discontinue the energy 
supplies because Moldova had not paid for them.

  [Text] The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic has outlawed any activity 
aimed at the organization of elections to the new parliament of 
Moldova in the Dniester Republic. 
  In accordance with the resolution adopted on Wednesday, the 
elections to the parliament of Moldova in the Dniester Republic 
have been outlawed and the persons guilty of organizing the 
election campaign will be prosecuted. 
  Observers in Tiraspol link this decision of the Dniester 
Republic parliament with the decree of the president of the 
Dniester Republic, Igor Smirnov, on the introduction of a 
"special situation" in the region. 
  Parliamentary elections in Moldova will be held on February 
27.

Snegur met today with inhabitants of Slobozia District and 
Tiraspol who plead for Moldova's territorial integrity and 
independence, at their demand, states the presidential press

  [Text] Kiev, 20 Jan--Deputies began the first day of work 
of the Ukrainian Supreme Council's ninth session with a 
discussion of issues connected with organizing the present 
parliamentary session's 12th meeting and the procedure for 
broadcasting the session's work. Some deputies proposed to hold 
plenary sittings of the ninth session of parliament in cases 
where issues will require urgent discussion by Ukraine's Supreme 
Council. Such a step was motivated by the start of the 
pre-election campaign, in which a significant number of deputies 
are participating. 
  The agenda for the Supreme Council's work for January 1994 
was proposed to deputies. The issue concerning the results of 
the trilateral negotiations in Moscow is not among the 70 issues 
designated for discussion at the session. A report from Popov's 
commission (concerning the "Blasko" concern [Black Sea shipping 
company]) has been added to the list of issues that may be 
discussed depending on their state of preparedness and time 
permitting. Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch described 
the examination of the law on additions to Point 7-2 of Article 
115 of the Constitution to be among the most important issues. 
It states that the president may repeal acts of the Cabinet of 
Ministers and other bodies of central power if they are in 
violation of Ukraine's constitution. This issue is connected 
with events in Crimea. 
  Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil voiced a demand from Rukh 
to convene a parliamentary commission connected with attacks on 
Rukh's headquarters in Chernovtsy and Ternopol, an attempt on 
the life of Colonel Butko, a parliamentary candidate from Rukh, 
and the kidnapping of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, head of Rukh's 
secretariat. 
  Chornovil proposed that the issue of the anti-constitutional 
actions of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who blatantly 
violated a parliamentary resolution of 18 November (regarding 
the ratification of START I) and the situation in Crimea, be 
included on the agenda and discussed immediately.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunaiskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk signed a decree on Wednesday, removing Ivan Yermakov 
from the post of presidential representative in Sevastopol, 
sources close to the presidential office reported on Thursday. 
  Kravchuk temporarily transferred the duties of his 
representative in Sevastopol to Nikolay Glushko, first deputy 
head of the city administration. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt at the press centre of the Black Sea Fleet 
later in the day that the Union of Afghan Veterans, the 
Sevastopol Russian community, the Crimean Movement of Voters, 
the union in support of the Crimean Republic and the leadership 
of city social services voiced support for Yermakov. 
  It is expected that the Sevastopol city council will call a 
special session in the near future to discuss Yermakov's 
resignation. 
  Local analysts believe that the resignation of the 
presidential representative in Sevastopol was caused by his 
participation in the election campaign as a candidate for the 
post of Crimean president. 
  Yermakov made repeated statements during the campaign that 
the problem of the Black Sea Fleet should be resolved in favour 
of Russia. 
  According to analysts, Kiev was also evidently riled by the 
fact that Yermakov did not support the candidacy of Crimean 
Parliament Speaker Nikolay Bahrov during the election campaign.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Semena report: "Once a `Hawk,' Now a `Dove'"] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol -- Yuriy Meshkov, the contender for the 
Crimean presidency who polled the largest number of votes in the 
first round of the election, has ceased to be a "hawk" and has 
become a "dove" instead. 
  He has switched from peremptory accusations against Ukraine 
to the search for forms of cooperation. Asked whether he is not 
afraid that Kiev will block the second round of elections, Yu. 
Meshkov answered: "I trust Leonid Kravchuk very much; he is one 
of the most eminent politicians of the present day, and he knows 
how to settle the situation in Ukraine and abroad. He has 
stated that the actual disposition of forces in the Crimea 
precludes the use of strong-arm methods to influence the 
situation, and I believe that he is speaking sincerely." 
  Yuriy Meshkov stressed: "The people of Crimea have voted for 
change, for a departure from the old nomenklatura-based laws of 
life, and for a close alliance with Russia" and the CIS 
countries. This will make it possible to improve relations 
between Kiev, Simferopol, and Moscow. He said that by this vote 
the people have legitimized the institution of the presidency in 
the Crimea and that Kiev's dissatisfaction with the first round 
results is a "reaction to personalities, not to the legislation 
and constitution of the Crimea.... It is a short-term 
dissatisfaction and will soon evaporate."

  [Text] Two days after a bloody attack, Crimean People's 
Deputy Iskandr Mamedov has died after having not regained 
consciousness. Mamedov had been the organizer of Mikola Bahrov's 
presidential election campaign in the Crimea. 
  As we have already reported, as the result of a terrorist 
attack -- in which still-unidentified assailants opened fire on 
Mamedov's house -- 11 people, including two of Mamedov's 
children, were wounded, two people were killed, and Mamedov was 
taken to the emergency room of a local hospital in extremely 
critical condition. Surgeons removed several bullets and grenade 
fragments from his body, which he had tried to use as shield to 
protect his children. Surgeons did everything possible, but, to 
our great regret, neither two operations nor modern methods of 
treatment could bring this kind and talented man -- the father 
of seven children -- back to life. 
  Ukrainian Radio expresses its sincere sympathy to the family 
and friends of the deceased.

  [Text] Kiev, 18 Jan -- In his speech at the conference of 
representatives of local councils of people's deputies of 
Ukraine, President Kravchuk noted that the problem of state 
building facing us, which had two aspects: internal political 
(to lay the basics of a balanced interaction between the 
branches of power and the creation of preconditions for their 
renewal) and external political (Ukraine has the image of a 
state that carries out a balanced policy). The first step along 
this path are the elections on 27 March. 
  Leonid Kravchuk noted that it is inexpedient at this time to 
drag out the constitutional process because it leads to chaos 
and anarchy. He proposed the following mechanism: To support 
the basic conceptual provisions on the organization of state 
power and self-government today and then this would be examined 
by the Supreme Council and later submitted to a nationwide 
discussion. In the president's opinion, it would be inexpedient 
to include the issue of state symbols and language in the 
constitution. 
  An amendment submitted by President Kravchuk was adopted 
regarding the Crimea: bodies of state power of the Crimea are 
formed on the basis of the constitution and laws of Ukraine; the 
authority of the Supreme Council of the Crimea may be suspended 
by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. 
  Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council, said that an 
amendment to Article 114 of the Constitution, namely that the 
president may cancel acts of the state power of the Crimean 
Republic which contradict Ukraine's current legislation, will be 
discussed at a meeting of the Supreme Council on 20 January.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "An Armed Attack on the Rukh </F>
Secretariat. Mysterious Disappearance of Its Chairman"] 
  [Text] Overnight between 15 and 16 January, an armed attack 
was made on the Rukh [Ukraine People's Movement for Perestroyka] 
Secretariat in Kiev. As reported by RUKH-PRESS, two unknown 
persons, claiming that they had to hand a package of documents 
from Lvov to chairman of the Secretariat Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, 
entered the reception room together with a watchman. As 
Mykhaylo Boychyshyn was not there, the visitors started 
telephoning him at home. After the call, which seems to have 
remained unanswered, one of the attackers pulled out a pistol. 
Hitting the guard on the head twice, he ordered that the 
chairman of the Secretariat be found immediately. After the 
watchman's refusal to fulfill the order, the attackers demanded 
that another guard they had noticed before, be summoned. The 
latter offered resistance and locked himself up in a room. The 
RUKH-PRESS head, who was at work at the time, immediately called 
the militia. Before the militiamen appeared, the armed "guests" 
managed to escape. On the same day, chairman of the Secretariat 
Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, who had left the office about three hours 
prior to the attack, disappeared. His whereabouts are still not 
known. The day before, the premises of the Ternopil regional 
organization of Rukh were also subject to an armed attack. At 
night, unknown persons got into the building through the second 
floor window, broke the doors of the Information Center and of 
other offices, and carried out a pogrom there. Having made 
their way to the roof of the building, the offenders dismantled 
and stole the installation for satellite antenna reception. 
Law-enforcement organs have started an investigation.

  [Text] Kiev -- A session of the central leadership of the 
People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh] took place on 19 January. 
Three statements were adopted at the session. The statement 
regarding terrorist acts against People's Movement of Ukraine 
activists names numerous events, which have occurred in many 
oblasts of Ukraine, in particular the disappearance of Mykhaylo 
Boychyshyn, head of the Rukh secretariat, without a trace on the 
night of 15 January, and the reflection is expressed that 
"certain circles in the state are endeavoring to demoralize the 
democratic forces on the eve of elections and frighten their 
adherents by means of terror." 
  The central leadership of Rukh evaluates the tripartite 
statement on eliminating nuclear weapons in Ukraine as 
"capitulation by Ukrainian state officials to gross external 
pressure," which became possible as a result of the lack of a 
clear and consistent foreign policy by the government. The 
leadership of Rukh believes that Leonid Kravchuk, president of 
Ukraine, took a capitulatory step. 
  Evaluating the results of the presidential elections in the 
Crimea, the central leadership of Rukh stated that the 
president's policy, aimed at pacifying the separatist forces, 
failed totally. The leadership of Rukh believes that a further 
delay of resolute actions by the president and Supreme Council 
of Ukraine regarding the stirring up of separatism in the Crimea 
could lead to armed conflict and irremediable consequences for 
the citizens of Ukraine and peace in Europe.

  [Text] The central leadership of the Ukrainian People's 
Movement for Perestroyka [Rukh] has described the latest 
government moves -- the cancellation of credit arrangements, 
immediate repayment to the National Bank of loans, withdrawal of 
state subsidies for food, another round of administrative price 
rises, and procrastination in index-linking wages and delay in 
paying them -- as none other than the continuation of the war 
waged by nomenklatura in power against the Ukrainian people. 
Rukh demands the removal of these faults and warns that the 
continuation by state power of anti-popular measures will 
trigger spontaneous actions of protest which for their part will 
violate civic peace and impede a possible change in political 
tack by way of free elections.

  [Text] At a Tuesday conference of representatives of 
government bodies of all levels in Kiev, Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk supported the proposal on the removal of the 
president from the system of executive power. "The president 
should not be placed above everyone, just beyond the executive 
branch of power. He should control, but not interfere," 
Kravchuk said. 
  He described as the chief stabilizing factor "a balance of 
the powers between branches of government and their democratic 
transformation." Kravchuk promised that presidential structures 
would do their utmost to hold parliamentary elections in Ukraine 
and bring "qualified and loyal deputies" to the new parliament. 
However, in his opinion the elections are not the last step in 
reforming the system of government. Ukraine needs an integral 
system with a clear separation of powers. 
  The president also spoke for holding a referendum on key 
provisions of the constitution simultaneously with the 
parliamentary elections on March 27. He confirmed his proposal 
to drop from the fundamental law provisions concerning the 
official language, state symbol, and flag, the state order and 
other matters that might cause political confrontation. 
  On the latest developments in Crimea, Kravchuk said he 
believes the new constitution should declare that the executive 
branch of power in the autonomous republic be formed and act on 
the basis of the constitution and legislation of Ukraine as well 
as the Crimean constitution that should conform with the 
Ukrainian fundamental law. 
  Kravchuk suggested amending the constitution offering 
president powers to cancel the decisions of the Crimean 
parliament, if they contradict acting Ukrainian legislation. 
  The speaker of parliament Ivan Plyushch promised that such 
an 
amendment would be made and the conference voted for including 
the matter in the final document. 
  The president agreed with the proposals of participants to 
cut down the staffs of executive bodies of all levels by 
25%.

  [Text] To improve the system of the state and executive 
branch institutions, to eliminate duplication of their 
activities, to elevate the role and responsibility of the state 
administration while implementing legal acts and carrying out 
economic reforms, and to reduce expenditures for its upkeep, the 
Ukrainian president decided the following: The Ukrainian 
Cabinet of Ministers shall examine within two weeks a list of 
ministries, state committees, and other institutions of the 
legislative and executive branches, and will submit its 
proposals regarding their reduction and the implementing of 
other kinds of structural changes. The draft state budget for 
1994 shall also reflect a reduction of expenditures for central 
and local institutions of the legislative and executive branches 
based on 30 percent cutbacks in the central administration 
personnel and 20 percent in the local administration personnel. 
The Crimean Supreme Soviet and local councils shall be advised 
to undertake relevant measures with regard to governing 
structures, the streamlining of personnel in regional and local 
self-governments and their executive committees at an arbitrary 
scale as of 1 January, 1992 [as heard].

  [Excerpt] Kiev -- Yesterday, the government examined the 
draft plan for the economic and social development of Ukraine 
and the draft general budget for 1994. A news conference was 
held by Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, and Valentyn 
Popov, Yuriy Yekhanurov, and Viktor Kalnyk, deputy ministers of 
the economy, who reported that the Cabinet of Ministers has 
given a second reading of the plan for socio-economic 
development and the budget for the third time. 
  Hryhoriy Pyatachenko stressed that, taking into account 
anti-inflationary measures and in accordance with a price index 
of 4.45 [not further specified], "a deficit-free budget was 
drawn up on a realistic basis," with expenditure of 342 trillion 
and income of 342 trillion [currency not specified]. "We will 
make a realistic gross product of 480 trillion, and not 750 
trillion, as in the first version of the budget," said Hryhoriy 
Pyatachenko. 
  The finance minister proposed that profit tax be increased 
from 30 percent to 40 percent. Carrying out an instruction by 
the Supreme Council, the Ministry of Finance is laying down in 
the budget a reduction of expenditure on maintaining the 
administrative apparatus, by 30 percent on bodies of executive 
authority and by 19 percent on local administrations. This step 
alone should save the budget 388 billion karbovantsi. 
  Asked by a UNIAN correspondent as to how the annual budget 
can be a deficit-free one when the Ministry of Finance has 
planned to receive income of 8.8 trillion and with expenditure 
of 21.515 trillion in January 1994 alone, the finance minister 
denied the very existence of a deficit at the beginning of the 
year, and stated that he believes in adhering to a deficit-free 
budget. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Supreme Council commission for issues of 
economic reform and national economy management did not support 
the government's draft state budget of Ukraine for 1994. This 
has been reported by the commission chairman, people's deputy 
Volodymyr Pylypchuk. According to him, the budget document, 
although submitted as a balanced one, is unrealistic both in 
practical and theoretical terms because it envisions that 73 
percent of the gross product or 91 percent of the national 
income should be distributed through the budget. Besides, the 
draft budget envisions such a tax pressure which will reduce the 
index of the producers' business activity, believes Volodymyr 
Pylypchuk.

  [Text] Kiev -- As already reported, Ukraine's Free Trade 
Unions [VPU] called on Ukrainian citizens to hold an 
all-Ukrainian strike on 18 January demanding immediate 
resignation of the Cabinet of Ministers and appointment of a new 
prime minister who would form a government and implement 
economic reforms before the election of a new Supreme Council. 
In an interview for UNIAN today, VPU Chairman Oleksandr Mryl 
confirmed plans to go ahead with the strike which, according to 
him, would be staged in the form of a "first Kiev popular 
assembly," since the city administration refused permission to 
hold an authorized rally. 
  According to preliminary calculations, about 10,000 workers 
from Kiev's Bilshovyk and Leninska Kuznya plants, pilots, and 
railroad employees will gather on Independence Square tomorrow 
morning. It is planned to approve a resolution on the Ukrainian 
citizens' appeal to support the Free Trade Unions' demands. 
  According to the plan, the strike will last for two or three 
weeks until Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers resigns. According 
to Oleksandr Mryl, telegrams of support for the strike arrived 
from Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, Lvov, and Volyn oblasts. Donetsk 
miners will also go on strike tomorrow. 
  Oleksandr Stoyan, chairman of Ukraine's Federation of Trade 
Unions [FPU], told UNIAN the FPU does not support the strike and 
will take the stand of an observer.

  [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in 
Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 14 January carries another program of a 
series which gives air time to representatives of various 
political parties in Ukraine to present their election 
platforms. An unidentified presenter announces that today's 
program will present the election platforms of the Christian 
Democratic Party and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. The Labor 
Congress of Ukraine is represented by Yuriy Yekhanurov, deputy 
minister of economy, and (Anatoliy Tovstoukhov), the secretary 
of the political executive committee of the Labor Congress of 
Ukraine. The Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine is 
represented by Vitaliy Zhuravskyy, party chairman. 
  The first representative of the Labor Congress speaks in 
Russian. He says the current leadership is to blame for 
Ukraine's crisis and the current year's budget, adopted by the 
government, is an example of yet another deception of the 
people. Therefore, he says, it is clear why political parties 
and movements are striving to take power. 
  As background information, the representative says the Labor 
Congress was formed in April 1993 on the basis of the Union of 
Small Enterprises, the Union of Leaseholders, several 
independent trade unions, youth organizations, and the 
all-Ukrainian Association of Entrepreneurs. Today it has a 
membership of over 2,000 and affiliations in 18 oblasts and in 
Kiev. The party is an independent party of centrist orientation 
and its objective is active participation in the election 
through the 2nd congress, which is to take place on 29th, the 
setting up of the socio-political bloc "Solidarity for the Sake 
of Well-Being and Progress," and the party intends to form a 
faction in parliament. Among the party's nominees is former 
Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who was nominated by the 
Dnepropetrovsk organization of the Labor Congress of Ukraine. 
  The representative then states the party's election program 
envisages three priorities: man, market economy, and state. In 
his opinion, neither the West, as a whole, nor Clinton will help 
Ukraine unless it helps itself. 
  In conclusion, the first speaker says the party favors 
expansion of cooperation with Russia and other CIS countries in 
the economic sphere. The party believes that Ukraine should be 
a presidential-parliamentary republic with the growing 
decentralization of the administrative economic system which 
should lead to federalism. Enterprises and regions should be 
granted more rights; the social policy should be geared to 
ensuring people's right to work; salaries and wages should 
correspond to the cost of living, and support should be rendered 
to young families, pensioners and invalids. 
  The second representative of the Labor Congress of Ukraine 
speaks in Ukrainian. He says the economy should be re-oriented 
toward satisfying social needs. One of the goals is to increase 
the number of private owners. Private property will be a basis 
for improving the economic situation. The state should retain 
its functions as a regulator during the transitional period of 
market transformations. More jobs should be created as soon as 
possible. Credits should be given to working private owners and 
to those who wish to build their own homes. 
  Next, the program's presenter invites the audience to watch 
and listen to a video recording of the election speech made by 
chairman of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine Vitaliy 
Zhuravskyy. 
  Vitaliy Zhuravskyy says that it is time to do away with 
miserable existences, scanty wages, sky-rocketing prices, the 
mafia, and corruption. The Christian Democrats call on the 
people of Ukraine to elect honest and decent people to the new 
parliament. Ukrainians have always had worse living conditions 
than the peoples of democratic countries and those who initiated 
perestroyka were the first to flee Ukraine to find refuge 
abroad. For example, the former minister of power engineering 
of Ukraine, Sklyarov. 
  Zhuravskyy says the Christian Democrats build their ideology 
on the philosophy of faith, hope, and charity. His party will 
insist that Ukraine's share of the former USSR property be 
returned and that the gold and diamond funds, as well as the 
property abroad, be divided fairly. Reforms, he says, should be 
launched in practical terms with agriculture being a priority. 
The Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine supports different 
forms of ownership in the countryside. 
  Continuing with the economy, Zhuravskyy says the energy 
sources must be diversified and energy-saving production methods 
must be developed. A rigid credit and financial policy is 
imperative to curb inflation. However, most important are 
demonopolization and privatization on a nation-wide scale, as a 
result of which every citizen should receive his share of the 
state property. All forms of ownership: state, joint-stock, 
and private must be on an equal footing. The taxation system 
should be revised so as to give a boost to the production 
sphere. 
  Zhuravskyy adds that today, during the period of a 
transition 
to civilized economic relations the teams led by Parliament 
Speaker Ivan Plyushch and President Leonid Kravchuk show total 
inability and feebleness in forming an efficient government of 
reformers. 
  The Christian Democrats favor a strong and efficient army 
which will ensure Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ukraine 
should become a state with a powerful space industry, Zhuravskyy 
says. 
  On religion, Zhuravskyy says the Christian Democrats support 
the equality of all church denominations and the separation of 
church and state. As a human rights organization, the Christian 
Democratic Party of Ukraine believes that human rights and the 
rights of the nation must not exclude each other. 
  Finally, Vitaliy Zhuravskyy says his party will use its vast 
international relations to cope with the Chernobyl aftermath and 
help its victims. Help will also be provided to labor and war 
veterans.

  [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 18 January carries the program 
"Approaching Elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine." The 
program features platforms presented by the Democratic Party of 
Ukraine [Demokratychna Partiya Ukrayiny] and the People's 
Movement of Ukraine [Narodnyy Rukh Ukrayiny], also known as 
Rukh. The announcer says each party has been given a 10-minute 
slot on this evening's program during which each party can 
presents its views. 
  The Democratic Party of Ukraine begins its slot with a brief 
video recording. Party chairman Volodymyr Yavorivskyy then 
takes the floor in the TV studio, naming some party members, and 
saying that the Democratic Party was born not out of its 
leaders' ambitions but out of a reality of building a Ukrainian 
state. According to sociological polls, Yavorivskyy says, the 
party occupies first place in Ukraine. He says his party is not 
looking for enemies, preferring to use the word "opponents." 
  Yavorivskyy says people are fed up with the statutes and 
programs of different parties. The Democratic Party is not 
looking for someone to blame, he says, but for a way out of the 
complex situation that has arisen. He says the main cause of 
the current difficulties was that nothing was done with reforms 
after independence. A reform of the authorities, he says, 
should have been the first step after independence. But the 
same weak and irresolute authorities remain, he says. 
  Yavorivsky favors the law proposed at today's conference of 
local representatives. In accordance with the law, elections 
would be held for local leaders who would then bear 
responsibility for their actions. He goes on to say that the 
issue of reducing the army should be resolved wisely, adding 
that servicemen cannot just be thrown onto the street. He 
proposes that those leaving the army voluntarily could be given 
a double privatization package and that construction detachments 
be formed to speedily build accommodation for them. 
  But the main thing is economic reforms, Yavorivskyy says. He 
and his party are against shock therapy, because people are 
already exhausted. It is necessary, however, to advance toward 
reform. He adds he is convinced people are ready for economic 
reforms. He says society has been polarized into rich and poor, 
and that a middle class should be created. 
  The Democratic Party's slot finishes with another brief 
video 
recording. 
  The entire Rukh slot is taken up by a video recording 
featuring Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil. Chornovil starts by 
saying he believes viewers are fed up with traditional election 
broadcasts from the studio, finding it hard to tell the 
difference between the programs of various parties and having 
little faith in them either. He believes the reason for it all 
is to show that Ukraine has a multi-party system. But this is 
not so, he says, because of the anti-party nature of the law. 
If there were a proportional or mixed electoral system, he 
says, it would be different -- fewer parties and one clear 
winner, which would assume full responsibility for what occurs 
in Ukraine. 
  He goes on to say Rukh stands for fundamental political 
reforms. He mentions today's conference of local 
representatives, adding that the main elements of the draft law 
discussed at the conference have been taken from Rukh's program: 
elections of leaders at all levels, eliminating the post of 
presidential representative, the president being head of state 
and not head of the government, with all branches of power being 
clearly delimited. He goes on to say that the judicial system 
needs to be reformed because it is deeply corrupt, turning a 
blind eye to the deeds of the Communist nomenclature. It is 
necessary, he says, to bring order to the country's finances and 
put an end to the bedlam. If this were done, pensioners, 
disabled people, and mothers with many children could be paid 
twice as much, he says. Reforms should begin immediately. 
  Chornovil refutes the accusation that democrats conducting 
reforms have put the country in the situation it is in now, 
saying democrats have not been in power to do so. Ukraine is 
traditionally an agricultural state, he says, and therefore it 
is necessary to start with agrarian reforms. But as the 
nomenclature has acquired land illegally, it is necessary to 
return what has been acquired illegally so that conditions are 
equal before beginning extensive privatization. Rukh pays 
special attention in its program to social protection. He says 
the Communists pose as the greatest protectors of the people, 
but it is they who brought about the situation in the first 
place. 
  Rukh is for assistance directed to where it is most needed, 
Chornovil says, but it's not for everyone. If privatization and 
land reform are conducted, Rukh proposes to carry out monetary 
reform with the introduction of the hryvna. But if the hryvna 
were to be introduced now, it would share the same fate as the 
coupon and be dead within a few months. It is necessary to 
demonopolize extensively, he says. Then there will be true 
market prices, considerably lower ones than now. 
  Chornovil concludes by saying Rukh is the greatest political 
force in Ukraine today. If the viewers support it and it gets 
at least 25 percent of the seats in parliament, then other 
reformist forces there could unite around the basis of this 
foundation and a government of national confidence could be 
formed. He asks viewers to vote for Rukh candidates, adding "we 
won't let you down."

  [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 20 January carries the program 
"Approaching Elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine." The 
program features platforms by the Ukrainian Party of Solidarity 
and Social Justice [Ukrayinska Partiya Solidarnosti I 
Sotsiyalnoyi Spravedlyvosti] and the Party of Free Peasants of 
Ukraine [Partiya Vilnykh Selyan Ukrayiny]. The announcer says 
each party has been given a 10-minute slot on this evening's 
program during which each party can present its views. 
  The first slot is taken up by a video recording made by the 
Ukrainian Party of Solidarity and Social Justice, featuring 
party leader Eduard (Lashutin) and Oleksandr (Bulavin). They 
speak in Russian. They see Ukraine as a community of peoples 
who live in harmony with each other, mutually enriching each 
other's cultures. Their party stands for Ukraine going along the 
path of civilized countries, where all have equal rights and 
where there is no antagonism between social classes. They 
propose a society where civic responsibility comes before class 
or ethnic interests -- a society of social partnership without 
crises or risk. They assure viewers that the situation with 
inflation and fuel shortages can be stabilized within one year 
at the most. They cite the experience of other countries 
without natural fuel resources. 
  Next, they link the activity of the state sector with 
private 
initiative. They propose that the form of managing the state 
sector and conditions under which it operates be changed, but at 
the same time not destroying it and creating a climate for the 
development of initiative in the private sector. Only 
initiative can fill the market with goods. The state cannot do 
this alone. The speakers go on to say that the state sector 
should be partially denationalized and the role of the state 
decreased, but such reforms should not be conducted in ways that 
decrease the rates of production and productivity. All reforms 
should be expedient ones. If the role of the state sector is 
changed, then a sector serving the interests of the people will 
be created. 
  The speakers add that everyone should be provided for, 
including children, pensioners, students, workers, servicemen, 
and that the country has erroneously rejected the welfare state 
of the Soviet Union, which was admired the world over. They 
want to make life easier for women. New young forces and more 
professionals should enter the new parliament. They finish by 
saying that a society with social protection can be created in a 
short period of time. 
  The second slot features (Vasyl Hordiyenko), head of the 
Party of Free Peasants of Ukraine. He starts speaking in 
Ukrainian and goes on to apologize because he is going to speak 
in Russian as his Russian is better than his Ukrainian and this 
will save time. His party was set up on the basis of the 
association of private farmers of Ukraine and has both private 
farmers and entrepreneurs among its members. The main aim of 
the party is to revive free peasants and entrepreneurs as a 
middle class in Ukraine. All who wish to work on the land 
should have land, freedom, and state support. If each takes the 
amount of land he wants and is able to cultivate, the only limit 
needed is a land tax. Then the allocation of land is not 
decided by corrupt bureaucrats. He says that the party's 
program is published in the party newspaper and offers to send a 
copy of the party's charter and program to whoever asks for 
them, and gives the party's address and phone numbers for this. 
He gives the main reason for the current crisis as the Supreme 
Council's "group of 239" and the president as the leader of that 
group, who have blocked reforms and privatization. (Hordiyenko) 
was present at an extended Cabinet session on 13 January 1992 
and asked the president to cancel the decree on liberalizing 
prices. He says that the West was for price liberalization in 
Russia, but only saw it as as a market for its own goods, and it 
is price liberalization that has brought about the current 
situation. There is a way out of the crisis. Political reforms 
should precede economic reforms. 
  (Hordiyenko) advocates creating a parliamentary republic and 
renouncing presidential government and the nomenclature 
presidential structures of government. The election of a new 
parliament on a multi-party basis is needed, which would form a 
government of reformers. As far as economic reforms are 
concerned, the basis of them should be the right to own land. 
He mentions the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, head of 
the Rukh secretariat, and accuses the "party of power." He 
appeals to President Kravchuk to ensure the safety of all party 
leaders, and to Levko Lukyanenko to gather representatives from 
all parties the following day to discuss the issue. He finishes 
by saying that one should conduct an honest political campaign.

  [Text] At a news conference on 19 January, Romualdas 
Ozolas, member of the Lithuanian Seimas, commented on Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev's statement on 18 January on Russia's 
policy on what Moscow refers to as the near abroad. Ozolas said 
Kozyrev's statement refers to a new annexation of the Baltic 
states. 
  Ozolas said the meeting in Moscow was attended by Russian 
ambassadors to the CIS countries and the Baltic states, as well 
as by a big group of Russian generals. It is also noteworthy, 
Ozolas said, that the meeting was held immediately after the 
visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton in Russia. According to 
Ozolas, Kozyrev has hastily distributed the keys to the solution 
of Russia's most important problems to the generals -- the keys 
to the CIS countries and the Baltic states. This is confirmed 
by Kozyrev's words that the refusal of military participation in 
those states would be the same kind of extremism kind as 
imperial suppression by tanks.

  [Text] Two statements were made by Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev about the Baltic states this week. The Baltic 
states, continually referred to as the near abroad by the 
Russian minister and other politicians, are accused of violating 
the rights of the Russian speaking population. 
  Looking at the development of the events in Russia and the 
foreign policy that is being pursued, the Lithuanian Seimas 
states with concern that of late Russian expansionism toward the 
Baltic states has become absolutely undisguised. 
  This was said in the official statement made by the Seimas 
members. Here is Ilona Rukiene with her report. 
  [Rukiene] The statement made by the Lithuanian Seimas reads 
that the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Latvia and 
Estonia was to end the abnormal situation that is the result of 
the 1940 aggression by the Soviet Union. These troops had to be 
withdrawn swiftly and unconditionally, especially after the 10 
July 1992 Helsinki summit meeting and the political document 
adopted by all the European countries, including Russia, as well 
as in compliance with the UN resolution of 1993. 
  However, the withdrawal is being suspended and protracted 
and 
ultimatum type conditions are being imposed. In addition, the 
protracted illegal presence of the Russian troops in Latvia is 
used for provocations and conflicts with threats to use 
immediately the huge Russian military force against the 
powerless neighbor. 
  The Russian foreign minister now makes statements and 
attacks 
the Baltic states several days after Bill Clinton's visit to 
Moscow. 
  This was also noted by Justinas Karosas, chairman of the 
ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party Seimas faction. 
  [Karosas] "The point is that the above-mentioned statement 
by 
Kozyrev, regardless of how it may be interpreted, caused my 
concern because it nevertheless appeared after the meeting of 
Yeltsin and Clinton in Moscow. 
  "At that time, on Monday, I was in Copenhagen at the meeting 
of the European Assembly. The European reaction to these types 
of Russian actions and statements is negative. I mean the 
reaction of the European states. I think that the three Baltic 
states will also react to this accordingly." 
  [Rukiene] The evident wish of the Russian politicians to 
divide the Baltic states can also be seen in the statement made 
by Andrey Kozyrev. While making threats to Latvia he proposes 
that Latvia should get in line with Lithuania and conclude 
treaties. 
  [Karosas] "Besides the Russian efforts to divide the Baltic 
states, which is understandable, we ourselves have contributed 
to this as well while competing over who will be the first to 
declare independence and so on. I am very glad indeed that of 
late mutual relations between the three Baltic states are 
becoming normal. It goes without saying that we will help 
Latvia politically and morally; we are undoubtedly standing with 
Latvia and Estonia. This is an unofficial concord of the three 
Baltic states." 
  [Rukiene] Algirdas Saudargas, member of the Lithuanian 
Seimas 
and former foreign minister, noted that there was nothing new in 
the Russian foreign policy and that Russia was successfully 
proceeding towards its objective. 
  [Saudargas] "Indeed, this a diplomacy that strongly defends 
Russia's interests and is carried out very well indeed. 
Essentially what they are doing --including such activists as 
Zhirinovskiy -- is testing Western reaction. You can call this 
screening [preceding word in English] as it is said in English. 
They make various statements that contradict one another 
measuring the reaction from the West. Until decisions and 
changes are established in the Russian policy (?this will 
continue)." 
  [Rukiene] In the opinion of Algirdas Saudargas, negotiations 
are taking place between Russia and the Western states on 
spheres of influence. 
  [Saudargas] "A natural division is taking place because 
Russia has withdrawn from the occupied territories and now this 
boundary is being established. [as heard] Russia will allow the 
Visegrad states to join NATO for a certain payment and it will 
be permitted to establish its influence on the territory of the 
former Soviet Union. I think that negotiations concerning the 
Baltic states are still going on." 
  [Rukiene] Gediminas Kirkilas, member of the Seimas 
Democratic 
Labor Party faction, is of the opinion that Andrey Kozyrev's 
statements are linked with his wish to remain on the post of the 
minister in the new Russian Government, and his statements, 
followed in quick succession, are called by Gediminas Kirkilas a 
political theater taking place after certain agreements with the 
United States. 
  [Kirkilas] "Recent events in Lithuania and the unexpected 
handing over of two criminals to Lithuania compel one to think 
that, maybe, the way is being paved for alleged violations of 
rights, which must be defended, and show to the whole world what 
is happening in Lithuania [as heard]. On the other hand, we 
must not [passage indistinct]." 
  [(Rukiene] Gediminas Kirkilas is for good neighborly 
relations and cooperation with Russia. 
  Romualdas Ozolas, Seimas member and leader of the Center 
Union, is of the opinion that after threatening statements by 
the Russian foreign minister to Lithuania and other Baltic 
states a dilemma must be solved: open aggression or a compulsory 
military alliance with Russia because, in his opinion, Russia 
did offer any other possibilities [as heard].

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Fully Understand..."] </F>
  [Text] This is what Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas said when he announced to the nation his official 
application to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner requesting 
admittance to this organization. There is no need to speak 
repeatedly about the Lithuanian nature of this application, 
because, most probably, the original was written in a foreign 
language [reference to Russian] and later translated into the 
state language, as is usually the case here. 
  However, the persistence which marked the long road to this 
decision is completely incomprehensible. Future historians may 
find a great variety of documents when trying to understand the 
evolution of the Lithuanian mentality toward NATO. There was a 
statement signed by nine political parties, including 
representatives of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party. 
There was a series of news conferences, briefings, and 
debates.... Every government official was ready to kiss the 
cross to certify that the dream of their lives and the goal of 
their activities is to bring Lithuania into NATO. Many people 
still remember the discussion broadcast over radio, in which 
Foreign Minister P. Gylys asked a rhetorical question with 
indignation: "What else do you need to prove that we really 
want to join NATO? We have already stated that we want to." As 
it turns out, less than half a month later, a simple statement 
is in fact not enough. Who lied to whom? 
  The opposition can raise a glass of champagne. It has sought 
an official statement on joining NATO with persistence. 
However, only the resolution adopted by the Seimas [parliament] 
at the end of the year forced the president to make up his mind. 
All talk about the unpreparedness of both sides and NATO's 
indefinite future ended. It was only mentioned that this move 
would require "determination, new decisions, and large material 
resources." As of today, we can state the presence of 
determination alone, while no one has yet mentioned new 
decisions and the necessary resources. Lithuanian politicians 
have not yet begun to comment on the president's decision. Only 
Seimas opposition leader V. Landsbergis expressed his opinion on 
"Radio Free Europe" on Tuesday night [4 January] and later 
circulated it to the press. Certainly, the professor also tried 
to show some concern and to be a little intimidating. "The most 
important thing is that the process of independence, peace, and 
European consolidation was not disrupted in the Baltic region by 
any undemocratic attempts of imperial forces." Such a desire is 
really timely, the more so since V. Zhirinovskiy is getting 
restless while explaining his opinion about subsequent relations 
with the Baltic states. The British Baltic Council has applied 
to Prime Minister John Major, stating that "these threats cannot 
be interpreted as shouts of an emotional person." Remembering 
the fact that thus far, the Lithuanian Government has neither 
approved nor condemned V. Zhirinovskiy's statements concerning 
the Baltic states, maybe we should begin to understand the 
president's letter as a reaction to the escalation of fascism by 
the "liberals" in Russia. Might this be one of the 
aforementioned "new decisions?" 
  We were the first to state clearly that we want to join 
NATO, 
and this statement was confirmed by the president's signature. 
Latvia has not done this yet, but our example may be 
contagious. We have learned from the Estonian Foreign Ministry 
that it does not intend to follow Lithuania's example in the 
near future. However, our move will not encourage the 
enthusiasm of Russian politicians, because NATO's borders will 
run into Russia's frontiers and lead to, if not confrontation, 
then at least some sort of mutual supervision. Yesterday, B. 
Yeltsin's press secretary circulated a statement which does not 
question our right to join international organizations, however, 
our arguments and motives are deemed unconvincing. The 
expansion of NATO can even destabilize the military situation in 
the region. This idea is not new. It has already been voiced 
by Academician Y. Primakov, Russia's chief intelligence officer. 
Now, this idea has been raised to the presidential level. 
  We have made a determined move not only on our way to 
Europe, 
but also to the world. When doing this, we always discuss our 
plan of action. The president only mentions that this step will 
require large expenditures. Being aware of Lithuanians' 
"rational character," one does not doubt that there are no 
estimates of costs on the president's desk. Our authorities 
know how to hide government expenses for one or another action. 
In our opinion, in this case they confuse their personal 
pockets with the state's budget coffers -- not by wasting money 
but by hiding expenses. We have already heard about the 
Napoleon-like plans of the National Defense Ministry to teach 
all recruits and officers English, to standardize armaments, 
form a battalion of "blue helmets," and fund commanders' studies 
abroad. The public already knows a little about the military's 
habit of spending state money. What will happen now? Democratic 
countries announce such expenses and debate them. Certainly, it 
is difficult for Lithuanians to realize that this harms neither 
defense nor finances. 
  Every decision has its own price. Until now, we have known 
only the moral price of this move. We may learn the remaining 
issues later. Progress toward a civilized community is not 
easily predicted. Even trains are planning to avoid Lithuania. 
We wish this decision was not similar to the first steps of the 
restored state, when everyone was confident that others must 
fulfill our political instructions and economic ambitions. It 
would be praiseworthy if our state leaders explained to the 
Lithuanian people what we have won by this move, because 
politicians' shuffling is not clear to everyone. A clear 
understanding of goals would enhance the latter's trust.

  [Report on interview with Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas by correspondent Ulla-Maija Maeaettaenen in Vilnius; 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Lithuania attempts to get into NATO but will probably 
have to be content with the Partnership for Peace offered by 
NATO. Lithuania, which is worried about its security, is also 
looking into other directions. It is aiming to have a union 
with central European countries, and it wants to have closer 
cooperation with Baltic and Nordic countries. Lithuanian 
President Algirdas Brazauskas will visit Finland this week. He 
was interviewed in Vilnius by Ulla-Maija Maeaettaenen. 
  [Maeaettaenen] Lithuania announced at the beginning of this 
month that it is seeking full membership in NATO. Lithuanian 
President Algirdas Brazauskas, who would have been happy with 
the Partnership for Peace agreement NATO has offered to several 
countries, had to give in for internal reasons and partly also 
because of pressure. Now he justified Lithuania's willingness 
to Yleisradio [Finnish Broadcasting Company] by taking as an 
example the Visegrad countries: Poland, Hungary, the Czechs and 
Slovaks. According to Brazauskas, Lithuania has the same motives 
with these countries to seek full membership, even though full 
membership would be very expensive for Lithuania, which is 
currently suffering economic difficulties. 
  Lithuania would like security guarantees from NATO because 
of 
Kaliningrad, which is part of Russia, but Brazauskas is calm. 
According to him, one should not frighten people with 
Kaliningrad, which can be also used in an economic way. 
  Of the Baltic countries, Estonia views Lithuania's NATO 
aspirations with extreme reserve. According to the Estonians, 
Lithuania thus wants to leave the Baltic security policy 
cooperation. According to the Lithuanians, as long as there are 
Russian soldiers in Latvia and Estonia, the step to NATO is the 
Partnership for Peace agreement, and it looks like Lithuania 
will also have to be satisfied with that. 
  President Brazauskas will meet NATO representatives in 
Brussels at the end of this month. Before that he does not 
agree to say what NATO has offered to Lithuania. 
  Lithuania's current plans include increasing cooperation 
with 
the Visegrad countries, possibly joining these countries. And 
one way towards a more comprehensive NATO cooperation is the 
joint peacekeeping forces of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. 
The training of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion of about 650 
men will start in Lithuania in the next few months. 
Preparations have already started. 
  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas will arrive for an 
official visit in Finland 20 January. Like other Baltic 
countries, Lithuania also wants to have closer contacts with the 
Nordic countries. Brazauskas sees as one possibility a joint 
union between the Baltic and the Nordic countries, with the 
principle three plus five. The idea is a few months old, and it 
is possible to develop it further, Brazauskas says. He hopes 
the Finns will take part in energy projects, and he put his 
hopes on the Via Baltica project. This is a challenge indeed; 
the problematic customs and passport checks can currently take 
hours at the borders of the Baltic countries alone.

  [Text] Members of the Lithuanian Seimas [parliament] 
Committee for Citizens' Rights and Ethnic Minorities have issued 
a statement concerning last week's letter from 72 Polish Sejm 
deputies addressed to the Polish president, Sejm speaker, prime 
minister, and foreign minister. The letter details the 
conditions which allow the signing of the Lithuanian-Polish 
interstate treaty. 
  "We are greatly surprised by the authors' proposal for the 
Polish Government to resolve such issues which are the 
prerogative of our domestic policy, and which we have solved 
since the very restoration of our independence," reads the 
statement by Lithuanian lawmakers. "This demonstrates that the 
authors of the letter are not well informed about the current 
situation of ethnic minorities, including the Polish one, 
residing in Lithuania. Experts from international organizations 
have concluded that the rights of ethnic minorities and their 
possibilities to preserve their ethnic identity meet the 
requirements of international conventions." 
  "We express hope that the statement by a group of Polish 
Sejm 
members will not become an obstacle to signing a 
Lithuania-Polish interstate agreement and declaration in the 
near future," concludes the statement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "About Arms and Views"] </F>
  [Text]We have received a letter from former National 
Defense Minister Audrius Butkevicius commenting on the series of 
articles in RESPUBLIKA entitled: "Who Armed National Defense?" 
  "All arms, ships, and helicopters," writes A. Butkevicius, 
"were bought by the National Defense Ministry following relevant 
Lithuanian Government decisions and resolutions, which identify 
definite mediators, prices, and terms of settlement." 
  "The purchase of ships described in the aforementioned 
articles was conducted in line with agreements signed by leaders 
of the Republic of Lithuania and Russian military institutions, 
the 1992 agreement signed by me as defense minister and my 
Russian counterpart, and Lithuanian Government resolutions. The 
aforementioned agreements envisioned that the money received by 
the Russian Baltic Fleet for its facilities sold to Lithuania 
had to be used for the construction of housing for Russian 
servicemen withdrawn from Lithuania. Since Lithuania refused to 
assume responsibility for the construction of this housing due 
to political considerations, the Russian Baltic Fleet chose the 
Lithuanian association `Selma' as a contractor, indicating that 
the money received for the sold facilities had to be transferred 
to this firm. 
  "Having analyzed the documentation submitted by the firm 
`Selma,' the National Defense Ministry leadership assessed it as 
being in line with Lithuanian law and concluded the necessary 
agreements. I did not and do not have any information about the 
past crimes of the firm's leaders. If a private organization or 
a person in Lithuania has violated the law or is suspected of 
such actions, the Interior Ministry and the Prosecutor's Office 
have enough measures to suspend the activities of such 
organizations and isolate such people. Until this is 
established, both firms and private persons are equal before the 
law, and no one, not even a journalist, has the right to insult 
them, no matter who they are. 
  "The firm `Selma' implemented the contract with the Baltic 
Fleet for the construction of military housing successfully, 
and, as far as I know, this firm is the current executor of 
Russia's state order for the construction of housing in 
Kaliningrad. It supplies Lithuanian builders with jobs. 
  "Military facilities acquired by the National Defense 
Ministry are assessed by the experts' commission and the one set 
up to determine prices. Their conclusions on the suitability 
and prices of these facilities were approved by the Lithuanian 
Government. I would like to add that both coastal defense 
ships, which, by the way, were acquired for the minimum price, 
participated in the NATO exercise 'Baltops-93,' along with other 
ships from Baltic countries and the United States, as well as in 
the exercise 'Barjeras-93' held by the National Defense 
Ministry. They have all necessary components, combat 
facilities, and spare parts. 
  "According to expert and inspection documents, the 
helicopters were acquired legally by the Air Force and they meet 
the requirements for combat aircraft, which can also be used for 
civilian purposes. 
  "I deem RESPUBLIKA's articles about the National Defense 
Ministry irresponsible, biased, nonobjective, and seeking 
sensation at any cost. I regret that this series coincided with 
Lithuania's statements on its integration with West European 
defense structures, as well as with a clear attack against 
Russia's democratic forces and former partners in negotiations 
with Lithuania. 
  "While creating the national defense system, I and other 
national defense officials had to work under extreme conditions: 
We experienced pressure from the former Soviet Union, our own 
intrigues, and the withdrawal of the foreign Army. The leaders 
had to choose one of two options -- either pursue a cautious 
policy of doing nothing, or adopt decisions and assume all 
responsibility for the development of national defense. My 
colleagues and I opted for the second alternative, and today our 
national defense has the minimum forces of space control, 
coastal defense, and land troops. We have also established the 
necessary relations to execute European programs of integration 
for these types of forces. In the opinion of foreign experts 
who took part in national defense exercises and conferences, all 
this was achieved over a very short period of time and with 
minimum expense. Let those who can, do any better," ends the 
letter from Audrius Butkevicius.

  [Text] Who deployed the Interior Ministry Troops on the 
streets of Minsk yesterday? Ivan Gerasyuk addressed this 
question to the Supreme Soviet chairman as he took the floor 
during the so-called miscellaneous portion of today's Supreme 
Soviet session. Stanislav Stanislavovich [Shushkevich] confirmed 
that the deployment had indeed taken place. In the vicinity of 
the Music Comedy Theater, a battalion subordinated to the 
commander of the Interior Ministry Troops was deployed with full 
combat readiness. The commander has been summoned to the 
legislature and will provide his explanations. 
  Meanwhile, People's Deputy (Verkhun) focused attention on 
changes in the tax policy and emphasized the fact that the tax 
on fuel has already increased 50 times compared to last year. 
Deputy Trusaw again addressed the issue of the eighth 
television channel. Deputy [name indistinct] expressed his 
concerns over the fate of unemployed, elderly, and invalid 
citizens. Deputy Prakapovich one more time called for the 
adoption of temporary measures to stabilize the situation in the 
agricultural sector. Deputies also addressed other important 
issues. 
  Following the miscellaneous period, it was announced that 
the 
session will be held behind closed doors.

  [Text] Minsk January 21 TASS -- A new scandal rocked the 
Belarusian Parliament on Friday [21 January] and lawmakers gave 
an outline approval to a draft resolution demanding to sack the 
interior minister and the KGB head. 
  The scandal erupted after interior troops were sent close to 
the building where the parliamentary session is going on late on 
Thursday. Lawmaker Ivan Gerasyuk asked the parliament to clear 
up on whose orders the troops arrived. 
  "Without naming the concrete people who gave the order it is 
impossible to continue the work of the session," he said. 
  Parliament Speaker Stanislav Shushkevich said that troops 
appeared in full combat readiness in downtown city and this 
could have been sanctioned only by the prime minister. 
  Shushkevich also informed that he had called Interior 
Minister Vladimir Yegorov and instructed him that his first 
deputy -- interior troops Commander Konstantin Platonov -- 
appears in parliament. 
  Shushkevich recalled that when the current parliamentary 
session began interior and reinforced police units appeared on 
Independence Square as well. 
  This time the troops appeared after two days of 
parliamentary 
discussions about who allowed Lithuanian police to arrest two 
communist leaders of Lithuania on the territory of independent 
Belarus. 
  Mikolas Burokiavicius and Yuozas Jarmalavicius arrived in 
Minsk for a secret meeting of communist leaders of the three 
Baltic states, were arrested by Lithuanian police and taken to 
Vilnius.

  [Text] At a closed parliamentary session in Minsk on 
Thursday, the national security commission formally requested 
the resignation of Interior Minister Vladimir Yegorov and KGB 
Chairman Eduard Shirkovskiy. 
  Yegorov is blamed for arbitrary actions by his subordinates 
during the recent arrest in Minsk of the former Lithuanian 
communist party leaders Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas 
Jermalavicius. Police arrested the two men without a sanction 
from the Prosecutor General. 
  Shirkovskiy is accused of office abuse. The commission 
believes that as the KGB chief he had to control the situation. 
  A group of lawmakers also demanded that the Prosecutor 
General Vasiliy Sholodonov step down. 
  Meanwhile, as has transpired from a dependable source, the 
Lithuanian side intends to formally press for the extradition of 
General Vladimir Uskhopchik, the former Vilnius garrison chief 
during the events in Lithuania's capital in January of 1991. 
  Uskhopchik now commands a unit of the 5th Belarussian army 
corps, headquartered at Bobruisk.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkovski] </F>
  [Text] After an extended parliamentary holiday, people's 
deputies of our Republic resumed their legislative work today. 
As I have learned at the press center of the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium, legislators in the Supreme Soviet are to discuss 
approximately 60 issues. 
  Today's session was opened by Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Stanislav Shushkevich. The first half hour was devoted to 
so-called miscellaneous time. Deputies delivered speeches 
dedicated to different issues connected with our complex 
socioeconomic and political life. Many of them appealed for the 
restoration of order in the Republic and for government 
officials not to work for themselves, taking advantage of their 
offices, but to work for the greater good of society and our 
Republic. The floor was taken by People's Deputies Zhykovskiy, 
Kholod, Antonchuk, Sudys, and others. Deputies agreed to hear 
speeches from Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and 
government representatives concerning Belarus forming a common 
monetary system with Russia. Later, the Supreme Soviet chairman 
came forward with a proposal to hold debate on the 44th item on 
the agenda -- ratification of the CIS Charter. Deputy Prime 
Minister Uladimir Zalamay delivered a speech on this topic. 
  [Begin Zalamay recording] The main goals of the CIS which 
are included in this bill are the comprehensive and balanced 
socioeconomic development of CIS states in the framework of a 
common economic zone, the improvement of international 
cooperation and integration, cooperation in protecting peace and 
international security, implementation of effective measures for 
reducing weapons and defense expenditures, liquidation of 
nuclear arms and other types of weapons of mass destruction, 
accomplishment of complete global disarmament, and the 
protection of human rights and basic freedoms in accordance with 
widely recognized norms of international law. [end recording] 
  Later, the floor was taken by Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Kebich. He assessed the situation which has developed concerning 
the proposed unification of our Republic's monetary-credit 
system with Russia's. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich point 
out that although this is a very complex issue, the government 
course on unification of the monetary systems is real. 
  People's Deputy Mikhail Zhebryk delivered a speech on 
ratification of the CIS Charter. Foreign Minister Petr 
Kravchanka and Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovski also 
participated in the debate on this issue. The opposition was 
represented by People's Deputies Uladimir Nolik and Aleh Trusaw. 
I have invited Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovski to comment on 
this issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Rutkovskiy] Pavel Pavlovich, deputies are 
criticizing the CIS Charter, particularly, the part concerning 
military union. What is your opinion on this issue? 
  [Kozlovskiy, in Russian] We in the [Defense] Ministry 
believe that this charter [on collective security] should be 
unconditionally ratified, if we want to become a full member of 
the CIS; and we have spoken about this. The charter includes a 
paragraph which directly concerns our military -- the Republic 
and the Defense Ministry -- and talks about the system of 
collective security. Addressing this issue at the session, I 
emphasized that we cannot consider ourselves to be a purely 
neutral state. Those who once declared their neutrality are now 
reviewing their statements. Countries are cooperating in 
Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, to reduce military 
expenditures and improve budgets -- to take less from a common 
taxpayer. Therefore, such a system is not a military union. 
This is a system of coordinating military cooperation, which is 
currently being established in the CIS on a parity basis. This 
(?department) is to help establish the National Armed Forces.

<F P=106> [Unattributed BELINFORM report: "Stanislav Shuskevich: `No </F>
One But Us Will Put Things in Order"] 
  [Text] On the evening of 17 January, Belarusian Television 
broadcast a one-hour-long live call-in program with Supreme 
Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich who answered many 
questions of the viewers. 
  People were interested in various aspects of our aggravating 
and difficult life. It is understandable that on the eve of the 
Supreme Soviet session, which is to resume its work on 18 
January, viewers wanted to hear Stanislav Stanislavavich's 
opinion on current matters. He called the situation in Belarus 
difficult and conflicting, and stated that it should be 
fundamentally changed. This task is beyond the current Supreme 
Soviet's powers, so he supports the idea of early elections. 
  It should be noted that sometimes the questions were posed 
point-blank. For example, Minsk resident Valyeriy Kharkow 
wanted to know whether it is not time for the Supreme Soviet 
chairman to resign of his own will. "If I had seen any 
advantage to my resignation, or if someone else had secured the 
holding of new elections, I would have resigned long ago," 
underlined S. Shushkevich. "Instead, I am doing everything in 
my power to propel the process of reelecting our parliament by 
preparing the necessary legal basis." 
  A viewer from Orsha, having stated that during the last year 
prices in the Republic increased 28 times, asked why the 
parliament does not replace Prime Minister Kebich who drove the 
economy into a dead end, with Karpyenka who is a supporter of 
market economy. To this S. Shushkevich answered: "The issue is 
not only in the government. Just look at your neighbor states 
of the former USSR. The situation there is no better. I think 
that we must look for people with market ideas and place them in 
the Cabinet of Ministers. This way we can activate the levers of 
the market economy." 
  Of course, the viewer did not forget to ask Stanislav 
Stanislavavich about his opinion on the unification of 
currencies with Russia, as well as about the consequences of 
this serious step for Belarus. The Supreme Soviet chairman 
stated that if unification brings a parity of prices for energy 
resources then the economic situation will begin to improve. 
Yet nobody but we alone can put things in order in our home. 
  Of course, it was impossible to answer all the viewer's 
questions during a one-hour cast. Besides, many questions 
required special references to be answered. Therefore, it was 
resolved that all the questions that were phoned in during the 
cast, should be handed to the parliamentary speaker who will 
answer them in full detail.

  [Text] Aleksandr Lukashenko, head of the Belarussian 
parliamentary ad hoc commission on corruption in top echelons of 
power, called on the Supreme Soviet at its meeting behind closed 
doors in Minsk today to hold a secret vote of confidence in 
Speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, 
Prosecutor General Vasiliy Sholodonov, Interior Minister 
Vladimir Yegorov, and KGB Chairman Eduard Shirkovskiy. 
  Lukashenko believes that these men are to a greater or

degree to blame for allowing Lithuanian authorities to kidnap 
and take to Vilnius Lithuanian communist leaders Mikolas 
Burokevicius and Juozas Jermalavicius in Minsk on 15 January.

  [Text] Forecasts predicting that left-wing forces rather 
than the opposition would come forward with demands on holding 
early legislative elections are coming true. 
  According to RID sources, the People's Movement of Belarus 
[NDB] has reaffirmed its intentions to participate in early 
elections. It has also claimed that it has better chances than 
its opponents expect. 
  Moreover, in the course of preparation for its congress, due 
in February, NDB will select candidates for the Shadow 
Government of National Salvation. A recently released statement 
confirms NDB aspirations to play an important role on the 
political Olympus: "No `coalition' or `alternative' government 
will be approved without NDB's acceptance. Any new government 
is doomed to failure without our approval."

  [Text] Russia's strategic missiles, which are on combat 
alert, will have a zero flight task. This was how Lieutenant 
General (Viktor Yesin), the head of the operational department 
of the main headquarters of strategic missile forces, explained 
the essence of the Russian-U.S. agreement on the nontargeting of 
their strategic missiles at one another. According to him, 
day-to-day control of nuclear weapons will be carried on the 
basis that Russia has no enemies as defined by the Russian 
military doctrine. At the same time, the general noted that 
under certain circumstances on orders from the Russian 
president, the supreme commander of the armed forces, targets 
could be introduced into the missiles' control system. This 
system still exists and the essence of a combat alert has not 
changed.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Pogorelyy: "Clinton's Double Loss"] </F>
  [Text] Les Aspin's term as U.S. defense secretary was to 
have expired today. Not a term laid down by U.S. legislation 
for the President's team, but the month for which the President 
asked the Pentagon chief to continue carrying out his duties so 
that the Defense Department would not be leaderless for a long 
time following Aspin's resignation announcement. Wishing to 
preserve continuity in armed forces leadership as well as the 
combativity of his foreign policy team, a month ago Bill Clinton 
picked a man who he regarded as a worthy replacement -- retired 
Admiral Robert Inman. But a week before the U.S. Congress 
resumed work (after the Christmas and New Year break) Inman 
suddenly announced that he was turning down the post he had been 
offered by Clinton. 
  If there were primarily political reasons behind Les Aspin's 
resignation, caused by the secretary's disagreement with some 
points in the President's course in both domestic and foreign 
policy, then in Robert Inman's case it is all much simpler, and 
more complex. Simpler because the retired admiral's reasons are 
clear: He indicated his reluctance to tolerate the current 
attempts in the press to sully his reputation, and it was not 
inconceivable that the search for blots on his service record 
would continue during the Senate hearings. 
  The difficulty in understanding Robert Inman's decision to 
withdrawn from consideration for a federal government 
secretaryship is due to such subtle matters as moral and ethical 
purity and decency. That is, categories very difficult to 
measure -- where do you find the relevant criteria? We know of 
many cases where senior leaders, statesmen, and government 
officials have continued to occupy their posts without batting 
an eyelid even when beset by the gravest accusations. What 
motivates them is their idea of duty to the people, to the 
voters, and so on. 
  In fact, Inman is weighed down by considerations of moral 
purity (strictly speaking, the accusations against him are not 
that horrendous, particularly by our Russian standards -- merely 
the tardy payment of Social Security taxes, not even concealment 
of them). The admiral decided it was impossible for him to 
weigh -- not on the scales of justice, but on the scales of 
public opinion! -- the 30-year service record of a career in the 
U.S. Navy and intelligence organs against the illusory benefits 
of a secretaryship. Actually, he had admitted from the outset 
that he had accepted President Clinton's offer not out of 
ambition, and certainly not out of a desire for material gain. 
Since his retirement Inman has had a pretty good life as head 
of two electronics firms and then of the U.S. Federal Reserve 
Service Bank in Dallas. A top-class professional who worked at 
the top of the Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security 
Agency, and CIA under various administrations without any party 
bias, he agreed to take the Pentagon post entirely out of duty 
to the country and the people. 
  So Les Aspin has not yet left the Pentagon building on the 
banks of the Potomac. He will be staying there until President 
Clinton picks a new candidate for defense secretary. It is hard 
to predict who it will be. But one can speculate about the new 
secretary's tasks. That is because Les Aspin, who is the first 
to leave the Clinton administration fold, during his spell in 
office managed to map out the main path of development for the 
U.S. armed forces over the next few years. It is hard to say to 
what extent this tallied with his personal views and beliefs, 
nonetheless the strategic guidelines determined by him are 
unlikely to be radically revised. Ultimately they are dictated 
by entirely objective factors of both international and domestic 
political life. First and foremost there are significant cuts 
in the armed forces' numerical strength and arsenal, a 
substantial reduction in the military budget, and, of course, 
against this background, the safeguarding of a high level of 
readiness of troops and naval forces for actions in defense of 
U.S. national interests and for participation in multinational 
peacemaking actions.

<F P=106> ["AN-PH"-attributed interview with Russian Foreign Minister </F>
Andrey Kozyrev; place and date not given: "Andrey Kozyrev Talks 
on Eastern Danger"] 
  [Text] Two trends are facing each other in today's Europe: 
the idea of a uniform and democratic Europe as opposed to the 
signs of further division. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev speaks about the goals that the emerging comprehensive 
European security system must focus on and how such a system can 
be established. 
  [Kozyrev] There may be too many seemingly efficient "simple" 
solutions. The bases for these proposals are mostly two factors 
that are regarded as axioms of a modern European policy. First 
of all, there is talk of a "security vacuum and gray zone" in 
Central Europe, an area that will most probably become a region 
of Russian expansion. It is also to be feared that "Russia will 
embark on a nationalist-empire policy" following the recent 
Russian parliamentary elections. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] Should one fear the revival of Russian 
imperialism? 
  [Kozyrev] One should not fear that Russian tanks might 
advance toward the West, because a Russian "performance" of the 
Yugoslav drama is much more plausible. Such a development would 
have dire consequences, such as several million refugees, 
large-scale industrial catastrophes, and the use of tactical 
nuclear weapons. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] In this case, what could NATO do to defend 
its Eastern European partners? 
  [Kozyrev] A few Chernobyl-type catastrophes could destroy 
all Europe, and the advanced positions could not save anyone. 
This worst-case scenario could be caused precisely by a hasty 
expansion of NATO, because this would strengthen the "threat 
concept" of the Russian extremists. The strategy of "counting 
on the worst" is also dangerous because it involves the 
possibility of a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
  The fears of an "Eastern danger" could be mostly dissipated 
if the European countries set up partnership relations with a 
democratic Russia that is building a constitutional state and a 
market economy. Russia has no territorial claims on any country 
in the world, and its military doctrine is clearly defensive. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] What is your opinion about the recent 
parliamentary elections? 
  [Kozyrev] Fascism has no grounds in Russia. The voters did 
not vote in favor of a "Western campaign" or the forced revival 
of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. They voted against 
the personal ambitions and stubbornness of some reform 
politicians and against misery and crime. 
  Several factors must be taken into consideration in 
establishing a new Europe. The so-called shock diplomacy and the 
policy of accepting events that have occurred should be excluded 
from the political methods. Russia is in favor of broad 
consultations among interested parties. Russia does not have 
the right to tell NATO which country it should accept; at the 
same time, however, Russia is justified in demanding that NATO 
take into consideration the particularities of the naturally 
extended interim period and, in the long term, it confirms the 
basic principles in its documents, principles according to which 
NATO is an open organization that offers free access to every 
democratic country in Europe. There can be no "first- and 
second-class security," or "special influence zones." Nor can 
be "isolated regions" or any "cordon sanitaire."

<F P=106> [Observer Manki Ponomarev "Opinion" article: "Did the </F>
Brussels Session Justify Expectations?"] 
  [Text] More than a week has passed since the extraordinary 
NATO Council session held at the level of the heads of state and 
government of the countries of this military-political bloc 
ended in Brussels. The stir in the mass media has abated, the 
drumrolls and fanfares have died away, and the ink has dried on 
the hurried commentaries hot on the heels of the event. The 
time for in-depth analysis of the positions of the session 
participants and the decisions adopted there is approaching. It 
is already possible to try to give a more or less detailed reply 
to the question: Did the NATO summit justify the expectations, 
which had become widespread long before it began? 
  These expectations were associated, above all, with the 
question of whether the North Atlantic alliance would manage to 
find its place in a world where there is no longer room for 
"cold war" and confrontation between the two systems. This was 
how not only political observers but also the very statesmen of 
the member countries defined the session's task. To chart the 
correct course in a rapidly changing world and to specify the 
bloc's political guidelines -- this was the chief purpose for 
which the top-level meeting was convened. 
  This was the chief task. But by no means the only one. The 
United States --and President Clinton spoke frankly of this -- 
sought to strengthen its political leadership within NATO and in 
European affairs on a new basis while not tying itself down with 
overly onerous military obligations. The West European members 
of the alliance in turn set a dual goal -- to expand their own 
role within the bloc's framework and at the same time to prevent 
the weakening of Washington's military presence on the European 
continent, which was becoming increasingly noticeable. 
  Central and East European countries, which were members of 
the Warsaw Pact, and also some others -- Albania, Macedonia, and 
Lithuania, for example -- took a special interest in the 
Brussels session. They were pinning their expectations on the 
fact that the NATO leadership had to decide the question of 
their admission to membership of the North Atlantic alliance and 
provide them with appropriate security guarantees. 
  Russia also expressed its position repeatedly. It was 
resolutely opposed to expanding NATO to include East European 
states. Not only because this would result in the bloc's 
military infrastructure being moved up toward Russia's borders 
-- which would require us to take serious and costly measures in 
the defense sphere. The point is also that the admission of 
some countries to the alliance would automatically mean the 
nonadmission of others. This would lead to a new split in 
Europe, form a deep ditch on the body of the continent -- much 
further to the east than the "iron curtain" of the "cold war" 
times -- and undermine the European security system, which is 
still fragile and has not yet become finally established. 
  Did the Brussels session succeed in resolving these, at 
times, mutually exclusive tasks? Probably the most laconic 
answer to this question was found by a Greek newspaper, which 
gave an article on the results of the NATO Council session the 
headline: "Yes, But...." 
  Yes, Bill Clinton was without a doubt the dominant figure at 
the Brussels summit. The dynamic U.S. President did a great 
deal to restore and strengthen U.S. leadership of the bloc 
allies. But experienced European politicians -- French, Dutch, 
Belgian -- with the support of other partners in the EC and the 
Western European Union, found their own countergambit. They 
forced the session participants to devote great attention to the 
Bosnian problem, which had not been on the agenda before, by 
raising the question of making air strikes against Serbian 
positions in the Sarajevo region. This additional item on the 
agenda loomed large in the discussion and to a certain extent 
put Washington in an ambiguous position. Whereas last summer 
the Americans were insisting on such bombing raids in the 
knowledge, however, that the Europeans would not countenance 
this, they have now been forced to agree in principle to 
punitive actions against the Serbs, but with an important 
proviso -- only on a mandate from the United Nations, not NATO. 
  At the same time the United States secured the unanimous 
approval of all the North Atlantic alliance members for its 
initiative -- the "Partnership for Peace." Elaborated in 
Washington, it is aimed at resolving several tasks at once. 
Above all, gaining time and preventing the weakening of the 
North Atlantic bloc as a tool of U.S. policy. In addition, 
preventing the admission of East European countries to NATO by 
offering them closer military-political cooperation instead -- a 
kind of probationary period with no definite time limits. 
  True, far from everything is clear yet with regard to the 
actual idea of the "Partnership for Peace" program and the ways 
to implement it, including, let us say, for Russia, which is 
also being offered a part in it. For a number of conditions are 
stipulated for involvement in it -- such as, for example, 
greater openness in military organizational development and in 
the military budget, the establishment of civilian control over 
the armed forces, participation in peacemaking actions 
implemented under NATO auspices, and others. A careful study of 
all this still has to be made. The NATO program is being 
studied attentively at various levels, including, as far as I 
know, in both the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and the 
Russian Armed Forces General Staff. 
  At the same time the NATO Council's adoption of the 
"Partnership for Peace" program came as a considerable shock to 
the Central and East European states. Putting a brave face on a 
sorry business, they welcomed this program with greater or 
lesser enthusiasm and declared that they were ready to 
participate in it. This was their official line. But at the 
same time President Lech Walesa of Poland, for example, did not 
even deem it necessary to hide his disappointment and rated both 
the program and the fact of its adoption as blackmail and as 
affording Moscow the right to "veto" decisions of the North 
Atlantic alliance. This disappointment is primarily associated 
with the fact that East European countries regarded entry to 
NATO as recognition of their affiliation with (West) Europe and 
as an opportunity to join the European Union [EU] and be 
involved in economic integration in the EU. 
  That this really is so is evidenced by the fact that on the 
eve of the session Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, and Bratislava were 
not even able to give clear expression to which alliance they 
would like to join -- NATO's military organization with 
multinational troops on Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and Slovak 
territories and with U.S. nuclear weapons, or a vague alliance 
granting certain guarantees but demanding practically nothing in 
exchange. Little consolation was provided by the claim made in 
Brussels that if any East European country, not a NATO member, 
is attacked in the future by some "expansionist" power, then the 
bloc "will almost certainly intervene." 
  When assessing the results of the extraordinary NATO Council 
session in Brussels as a whole, it has to be stated that, 
despite all their importance, they did not entirely justify the 
hopes pinned on it. The session's decisions were not crucial 
for NATO. The search for its place and role in the 
postconfrontational world is proceeding with all too much 
difficulty and too slowly. 
  On the eve of the Brussels summit the Hamburg weekly DIE 
ZEIT 
cited the words of the famous English military leader, the Duke 
of Wellington, the victor of Waterloo: "Nothing except a battle 
lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won." This is what 
has happened to NATO. Having achieved the aim proclaimed back 
in 1949, it has exhausted itself in its old form. Now the North 
Atlantic alliance is seeking a new purpose, a new raison d'etre. 
  Brussels showed once again -- yes, it really is seeking. But 
it has not yet found it. Maybe it should not even search?

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Nuclear arms should be removed from Ukraine to 
Russia within two years, beginning with January 1, 1994. The 
protocol signed last September in Massandra provides for this, a 
high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax in comments on the 
statement made by Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister, Boris 
Tarasyuk, at a news conference in Kiev on Wednesday [19 January]. 
  As Interfax already reported, Tarasyuk quoted high-ranking 
Russian military officials as saying that nuclear weapons can be 
removed from Ukraine within a year. But it is technically 
impossible to carry out this withdrawal so quickly, he said. 
Besides, Tarasyuk stressed, this would conflict with the 
understanding reached between the Russian, Ukrainian and 
American presidents on the need to withdraw the weapons and pay 
compensation for them simultaneously. 
  In connection with this, the diplomat pointed out that to 
remove all weapons within a year is out of the question. At the 
time, when the Russian and Ukrainian presidents met in Massandra 
Russian experts declared that Russia has sufficient technical 
opportunities for taking nuclear arms out of Ukraine within two 
years, he noted. "Our attitude to this issue remains unchanged," 
he said. 
  With reference to the issue of compensation, the diplomat 
pointed out that the documents relating to the meeting between 
the Russian, Ukrainian and American presidents in Moscow state 
that the removal of nuclear weapons must begin at once. 
Solution to the issue of compensation to Ukraine will be 
delayed until this May, when experts from the three countries 
will meet to discuss criteria for assessing the value of the 
weapons in question. "The principle of simultaneousness was not 
mentioned," the diplomat said. 
  According to him, the stand taken by Ukraine's parliament, 
which will discuss this issue in the near future, may also turn 
into a problem in the materialization of the 
Russian-Ukrainian-American agreement on nuclear arms. 
  The diplomat also disagrees with Tarasyuk's opinion to the 
effect that Russia allowed too many nuclear warheads to be 
concentrated at the places of their storage in Ukraine. 
According to Tarasyuk, this led to the current situation which 
is an accident waiting to happen. In this connection the Russian 
diplomat pointed out that "Kiev seems to have forgotten that it 
took the nuclear weapons under its own control administratively, 
and prevented Russian specialists from coming near it for a long 
time. No wonder the consequences are what they are," the 
Russian Foreign Ministry official stressed. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Grigoriy 
Karasin, confirmed that Moscow will grant Ukraine heat-producing 
elements for the needs of nuclear power plants in compensation 
for the nuclear warheads withdrawn from there. Speaking at 
Thursday's briefing in Moscow, he added that America's purchase 
of part of the uranium obtained as a result of dismantling 
nuclear arms will be conducive to resolving financial problems 
emerging in this connection. 
  The process of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament has become 
irreversible. This inspires Russia and the world community as a 
whole with optimism, Russia's Ambassador to Ukraine, Leonid 
Smolyakov, said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow. 
  According to him, the circumstance that "new people, who 
want 
to work constructively and who understand the situation in the 
right way," have joined Ukraine's Defense Ministry also gives 
rise to optimism. He meant the recently appointed defense 
minister, Vitaliy Radetskyy, in the first place, the ambassador 
said. "This subjective factor will undoubtedly be conducive to 
resolving objective problems in the nuclear disarmament area," 
he said. 
  With reference to the Crimean problem in Russian-Ukrainian 
relations, Smolyakov pointed out that "the issues connected with 
the structure of the Ukrainian state are Ukraine's internal 
affair." "We may have personal attachments and even nostalgic 
sentiments toward Crimea, but in our policy we must proceed from 
realities," the ambassador noted. 
  According to him, "the country's leadership has already 
begun 
to understand that Russia's policy towards the former Soviet 
republics should be given foremost importance, even though there 
are several unresolved problems, primarily those connected with 
financing Russian diplomatic missions in CIS countries."

  [Text] On 11 January, Russian President B. Yeltsin 
forwarded to Ukraine President L. Kravchuk a message of a 
personal nature. It says that the assassination of Black Sea 
Fleet press center chief Lazebnikov has been received negatively 
by the Russian leadership. This has been reported by a 
confidential source from President Kravchuk's entourage, who 
stressed that the letter proposes in a rather harsh form to 
impose order in Sevastopol by joint efforts, and to decide 
finally the fate of the Black Sea Fleet in light of the 
Massandra understandings. The letter was sent bypassing the 
diplomatic channels of the Russian Federation Ministry of

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report in the "Crimea" column: "The </F>
Situation Around the Black Sea Fleet Is Heating Up. Yet 
Commanders May Come to Agreement"] 
  [Excerpts] Recently Black Sea Fleet servicemen have often 
been showing their concern over the failure to resolve the Black 
Sea Fleet issue. [passage omitted] 
  In light of this the Black Sea Fleet Press Center has been 
authorized to make it known to personnel that documents have 
been submitted to the command indicating that the Russian Navy 
leadership shares the Black Sea Fleet servicemen's concern over 
the dragging out of the talks on the fleet's fate. The Russian 
Federation Navy Command has sent a telegram to the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry pointing to the impermissibility of unilateral 
actions with respect to the Black Sea Fleet. 
  "The Russian Federation Navy Command is doing everything 
possible to ensure the implementation of the Massandra 
agreements whereby the Black Sea Fleet with its infrastructure 
is to pass under Russia's jurisdiction," the press center's 
release stresses. 
  Attention in being drawn to the fact that the Russian 
president has sent a letter to the Ukrainian president 
suggesting that a detailed investigation be held into the 
circumstances surrounding the death of Captain 1st Rank Andrey 
Lazebnikov, head of the Black Sea Fleet press center, and 
expressing concern over the deterioration of the crime situation 
in Sevastopol. 
  On 17 January a telephone conversation took place between 
Black Sea Fleet Acting Commander Vice Admiral Vitaliy Larionov 
(Black Sea Fleet commander Admiral Eduard Baltin is currently on 
vacation) and Vladimir Beskaravaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian 
Navy. The sides discussed the current state of relations 
between the two fleets, recognizing the impermissibility of 
unilateral actions prior to top- level decisions on the Black 
Sea Fleet being made.

  [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Spokesman of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin said it is impossible for 
foreign officials to react to the statements of the Russian 
foreign minister without even seeing the full text of his speech. 
  "The Russian foreign minister has given a detailed enough 
characteristic of the inadequate reaction of official 
representatives of foreign states, including the United States 
and the Baltics to his speech on January 18. It is hard to add 
anything to it, however, a logical question appears: How such 
hasty statements can be made even before their authors get 
acquainted with the full text of the minister's speech, how does 
this get into the framework of normal and generally-accepted 
norms of political communication", he told TASS on Thursday. 
  "Reporters of ITAR-TASS and other news agencies have wired 
only separate quotes taken out of the context and it is not 
their fault that such a sharp response followed. All these 
moments were rather fully characterised by the foreign minister 
on January 19. He expressed concern that someone has not got 
rid yet of the image of an enemy in the face of Russia or tries 
to restore it. In any case this unfortunate incident should be 
a good lesson", Karasin said. 
  Before Kozyrev's speech on Wednesday Karasin told INTERFAX 
news agency that TASS had misconstrued Kozyrev's comments.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 20 Jan--"Incomprehension and indignation" 
has been provoked in Moscow by the official reaction in Latvia, 
Lithuania, and Estonia and a number of other countries to the 
statements of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the 
conference of Russian ambassadors to CIS and Baltic countries on 
18 January, reaction which was based on a distorted 
interpretation of the minister's words. This was stated today 
at a briefing by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Information 
and Press Department of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
  He stressed that "without waiting for explanations about 
what 
the minister of foreign affairs was really saying, or at least 
for the full text of his speech, representatives of the U.S. 
Department of State and some Baltic states deemed it possible to 
make hasty and unfounded statements." 
  One gets the impression, the Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman noted, that "instead of concentrating on the 
continuation of constructive work to finalize the agreements and 
treaties that are now the subject of negotiation, our Baltic 
partners have lifted individual quotations out of context in 
order to attract world attention yet again and to try and gain 
certain political dividends from this." According to Karasin, 
"another aim of this maneuver is to whip up an artificial 
hullabaloo and avoid making decisions on how the rights of the 
Russian-speaking communities in Latvia and Estonia can be 
properly safeguarded." 
  "In our view, the West should also be concentrating 
attention 
on these problems rather than criticizing a Russian minister in 
the way that an official spokesman for the U.S. State Department 
allowed himself to do," Karasin declared. 
  According to the Russian representative, the heart of the 
matter was "explained at length by the Russian foreign minister 
during yesterday's television address, and then again in the 
closing stage of the conference. "We do not see any need for 
additional clarifications," Karasin concluded.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 20 (TANJUG) -- Russia welcomes the 
agreement reached between Yugoslavia and Croatia to start 
normalizing ties as a constructive element in the efforts aimed 
at breaking the deadlock in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Thursday. 
  The spokesman, Grigoriy Karasin, told reporters that the 
declaration could not only help stabilize Serb-Croat relations, 
but also have a positive effect on resolving the problem of 
Krajina (the state created by Serbs within the boundaries of the 
former Yugoslav republic of Croatia). 
  The foreign ministers of Yugoslavia and Croatia, Vladislav 
Jovanovic and Mate Granic, signed in Geneva on Wednesday a 
statement on the normalization of mutual relations and opening 
of representative offices in Belgrade and Zagreb on February 15. 
  Belgrade said on Thursday the statement did not imply mutual 
recognition and establishment of diplomatic ties between the two 
states and did not prejudge a solution to the problem existing 
between Croatia and the U.N.-protected Republic of Serb Krajina.

  [Text] Geneva, 19 Jan -- "I am very disappointed. Once 
again, as during the previous round in Geneva and Brussels, a 
great opportunity to reach agreement has been wasted." This is 
how Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special 
representative and deputy minister of foreign affairs, assessed 
the outcome of the talks on a Bosnian settlement which ended 
here today, and which were attended by the delegations of the 
conflicting sides -- the Muslims, Serbians, and Croatians -- and 
the presidents of Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro. Although 
co-chairmen Turvala Stoltenberg and David Owen proposed 
solutions and approaches which could be "satisfactory in order 
to stop the war," no compromise was achieved, the Russian 
diplomat noted, speaking to journalists in Geneva's Palais des 
Nations. 
  V. Churkin, who met the representatives of the various sides 
during his stay in Geneva, describes the agreement signed today 
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia on the 
opening of official missions in Belgrade and Zagreb as "an 
important step in their relations." It may lead to the 
emergence of "a more positive atmosphere for solving major 
issues," in particular the problem of Krajina.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Anisimov article: "Ruble: All Right, Zayats!..."] </F>
  [Text] We are an incorrigible people -- our life is flat 
and disagreeable unless we are peering into the abyss. We just 
seemed to have begun to crawl away from the precipice of 
hyperinflation, we just seemed to have grasped the anchor of a 
stable ruble rate and told manufacturing enterprises: Sort out 
production or lower prices.... But there is no holding us. We 
decided on the union of the Belarusian and Russian monetary 
systems. So that we can fall into the abyss together -- falling 
is not so boring. 
  Over the past six months Belarus has suffered the total 
collapse of its economic policy. The national currency, the 
zaychik [little hare -- Belarusian currency carries symbol of a 
hare], has been devalued at a rate comparable only to that of 
the karbovanets. It is not surprising: Ukraine and Belarus 
both did nothing to reform the economy, traditionally counting 
on getting themselves out of a fix at Russia's expense. Whereas 
previously the standard of living in these republics was higher 
than in Russia, once Moscow introduced its own national currency 
and once the credit-money umbilical cord was severed, the 
situation changed before our eyes. The hunt was on for rubles 
at a time when everything but the economy was prospering in the 
fraternal republics. I have a friend, a so-called black 
marketeer at the Minsk Refrigerator Plant; he described how the 
trade in these very popular refrigerators is being "privatized" 
there: The ministry takes a fair amount of the plant's output 
and then sells it for a song (but for rubles!) to my "black 
marketeer," the latter smuggles the goods into Russia and has a 
good life. Everyone has a good life apart from the Belarusians 
themselves, who don't have refrigerators or rubles, and now 
their zaytsy [hares -- national currency] have fallen in value. 
  Why? What is the underlying reason for monetary union and, 
what is more, on such preferential terms for Belarus? After 
all, the plan is to exchange rubles for zaytsy at a rate of 1:1, 
although only a complete idiot would get less than 5 zaytsy per 
ruble on the market. As far as Russia is concerned, this means 
an instant rise in all prices of at least 10 percent. For what 
will we be paying? 
  The Central Bank of Russia led by Mr. V. Gerashchenko is 
behind the great idea of union. Having temporarily piped down 
over the past few turbulent months, Mr. Gerashchenko has once 
again made a brilliant display of his political skill. He 
prepared documents on the quiet and contrived to get them past 
Gaydar and Fedorov, past everyone concerned about the future of 
reform. And they, according to the plan, were to have made 
fools of themselves, whipping boys responsible for the upsurge 
in inflation which is absolutely inevitable in this situation. 
Naturally the fathers of Russian reform refused to don the 
dunce's cap. No, let the person accustomed to acting behind 
people's backs and dealing calculated blows on the quiet -- Mr. 
Gerashchenko -- try the cap on for size. 
  There are no sensible arguments in favor of union. There has 
been some talk there [in Belarus] about aid -- but who will aid 
us? Politicians have gone quite crazy if they are sacrificing 
the economy and the prosperity of their fellow citizens for the 
sake of a free handout to people who have no very great need 
thereof. Does Belarus have no money? Does it have no means of 
paying for energy resources? Does it have property? Well then, 
hand over blocks of shares in enterprises to settle its debts. 
Russian enterprises undoubtedly need the Belarusian market. 
But why pay for this with hyperinflation? 
  Russian reformers were performing a single task in 
disengaging the monetary systems, that of putting a stop to the 
endless provision of subsidies for the former union republics. 
That was achieved in the middle of last year. Is it all 
starting up afresh now? Why then the need for the absurd 
exchange of cash that caused the whole country to wait in line 
outside branches of the savings bank? 
  Many politicians' rosy dreams will have obviously been 
realized with leading economic reformers' departure from the 
government. The national leaders of the former union republics 
are happy to shift the burden of responsibility for economic 
mistakes onto Russia, while however retaining all the other 
attributes of a sovereign power.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin report: "Don't Close Window Into </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] It proved absolutely impossible to get hold of any 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet leader. They were all attending a 
session. Only the telephone of Aleksandr Sheleg, aide to the 
first deputy chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, was 
answered: "Our Prime Minister Kebich has long upheld the idea of 
a sound economic partnership. And his initiative for the 
republic to enter into a single ruble zone with Russia is 
consistent in this respect. After the breakup of the USSR 
Belarus effectively remains the sole window into Europe for 
Russia: The main air, railroad, and automobile routes and 
pipelines pass through it. We would not be a burden. Our 
flagships -- the tractor, automobile, and other plants -- are 
effectively standing idle now. And the same thing is happening 
in Russia. I am convinced that, if a decision were adopted -- 
and that is what our industrialists are waiting for -- things 
would return to life here. And I think Yeltsin realizes this." 
  It has become known that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
will come to Minsk in the next few days. His visit may herald a 
definitive decision in favor of unifying the two republics' 
financial systems.

  [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and his Armenian counterpart Vagan Papazyan 
discussed today at the Russian Foreign Ministry issues dealing 
with the early ceasefire and the termination of hostilities in 
Nagorno-Karabakh and around it, as well as the prevention of 
incidents on the border between the Azeri Republic and the 
Republic of Armenia. The foreign ministers were unanimous in 
their opinion that the conflict, started many years ago, cannot 
be resolved through the use of force and should be settled as 
soon as possible with the mediation of the Russian Federation by 
political means, by means of talks. 
  Russia, as a mediator, is seeking to bring the stands of 
both 
participants in the conflict closer together and to persuade 
them to sign immediately a ceasefire agreement, Galina Sidorova, 
political adviser to the Russian foreign minister, told 
ITAR-TASS after the end of the meeting. The talks are rather 
complicated, because the conflict is a long one, many problems 
have been accumulated in relations between the two sides, and 
they feel mistrust for each other, Sidorova said. Russia is 
doing its utmost for the agreement on the end of armed 
confrontation and prevention of destabilisation of the situation 
in the whole region to be signed as soon as possible, she 
stressed. According to Sidorova, "now it is difficult to say 
when the two sides will sit down at the negotiating table, to 
what extent a possibility of holding meeting by them has become 
more real. There is a draft agreement, and now it is necessary 
to bring the stands of the two sides closer together," she said. 
  Kozyrev discussed settlement problems also with Arkadiy 
Gukasyan, spokesman for the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership. 
  Last Tuesday the Russian foreign minister had a meeting with 
Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov within the framework of a 
programme of working consultations.

  [Text] It is hard to say how great the chances are for 
conducting a meeting between the presidents of Armenia and 
Azerbaijan in Moscow in the near future, the political adviser 
to Russia's foreign minister, Galina Sidorova, said in answer to 
Interfax's question on Thursday. 
  She made this statement after Thursday's talks between the 
Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, and his Armenian 
counterpart, Vahan Papazyan. The same day Kozyrev conferred 
with the Foreign Minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Arkady Gukasyan. 
  According to Sidorova, the main goal pursued by Moscow is to 
sign an agreement on a cease-fire and halting military actions 
in Nagorno-Karabakh. "Russia fears that the conflict may further 
destabilize the situation in the region," she pointed out. 
  "The negotiations are progressing with difficulty," Sidorova 
said. "Each of the warring sides has its own claims. It's a 
long conflict, and each side is apprehensive about taking some 
wrong step," she stressed. 
  In the meantime, as the chief of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's Press and Information Department, Grigoriy Karasin, 
said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow, the results of the talks 
held by Kozyrev with Papazyan and Gukasyan, as well as with the 
head of Azeri diplomacy, Gasan Gasanov, two days ago "show that 
the warring sides' attitudes to the possibility of signing an 
agreement on ceasing hostilities altogether have somewhat 
softened."

  [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Russia has joined the 
decision of the UN Security Council to prolong sanctions against 
Iraq for 60 days, but said oil embargo against it can be lifted 
in case the latter fully complies with disarmament demands of UN 
resolutions. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday 
that "certain positive shifts have been registered in Iraqi 
approach to fulfilment of decisions of the UN Security Council. 
This mostly concerns disarmament aspects which is acknowledged 
by the world community and was reflected in the latest document 
of the special commission on Iraqi disarmament". 
  Russia actively supports the idea of establishing a deadline 
for Iraq before which the efficiency of the system of control 
can be proved, as well as the honesty of Iraqis in fulfilling 
their pledges. 
  "In case after the deadline expires, and it should not last 
for more than six months, it is confirmed that Iraq honestly and 
fully implements the disarmament aspects of the Security Council 
resolutions 687 and 715, Russia will be ready to consider the 
issue of lifting the oil embargo according to item 22 of 
resolution 687", the document said. 
  Russia resolutely and invariably stands for the fulfilment 
by 
Iraq of all other resolutions of the Security Council on the 
post-crisis settlemenmt in the Persian Gulf, including the 
resolution 833 on the demarcation of Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. Only 
in this case can the issue of lifting all other sanctions 
imposed by Security Council against Iraq can be raised, the 
statement said. 
  The Russian position strictly corresponds to the terms and 
criteria fixed by decisions of the UN Security Council, it added.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin told a 
briefing on Thursday. 
  These are not military equipment deliveries, but a 
commercial 
deal, he said and explained that North Korea had bought through 
a Japanese company several decommissioned submarines from Russia 
which had been completely dismantled and cannot be restored as 
means of warfare. 
  "We view it as an ordinary trade operation. Russia concludes 
similar commercial deals with other countries as well", Karasin 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo January 21 TASS -- A Japanese mediator of the 
Russian-North Korean submarine deal dispelled fears of Tokyo and 
Seoul saying only three Russian decommissioned submarines 
without armaments had been sold to Pyongyang and had been 
scrapped there. 
  Ariyoshi Sibata, president of the Japanese company "Toen 
Shiozi", which mediated the deal told TASS on Friday by 
telephone from Beijing, where he is currently staying, that his 
company engages in trade in scrapped metal and therefore is 
interested in cooperation with Russia which has huge amounts of 
decommissioned machinery, including military equipment. 
  He rejected claims of U.S. mass media that Russia and North 
Korea had signed a deal envisaging shipments of a whole fleet 
consisting of 40 submarines which Pyongyang may use for training 
and as spare parts for its military equipment. 
  In October 1993 Sibata's company brokered a deal upon a 
North 
Korean request to ship three decommissioned and dismantled 
diesel submarines from the Russian Pacific Fleet to Pyongyang. 
  Sibata said the submarines had no armaments, were heavily 
covered with rust and were semi-submerged. The submarines had 
already been delivered to North Korea where they were cut into 
pieces 1x1.5 metres in size to be used as scrap metal, he added.

commercial firm. Therefore, the fuss whipped up by the Japanese

  The Navy's commander in chief added that the press published 
another untrue report, of unknown provenance, that the Pacific 
Fleet is to supply 40 submarines to the DPRK via a dummy 
Japanese firm. The Pacific Fleet simply does not have this many 
old submarines, Feliks Gromov said.

<F P=106> [Interview with (Yakovlev), Russian deputy foreign minister </F>
in charge of Korean affairs, by station reporter (Krietov) on 
Russia's relations with the DPRK and the ROK--from the "Various 
Aspects of Cooperation" program; place and date not given] 
  [Text] (Yakovlev), Russian deputy foreign minister in 
charge of Korean affairs, answered questions posed by station 
reporter (Krietov). 
  [Krietov] How were Russian relations with the DPRK and the 
ROK in 1993? 
  [Yakovlev] Relations between Russia and the two Koreas were 
developed in various areas last year. Let us recall what Russia 
has inherited from the former Soviet Union. 
  Relations between Russia and the DPRK have been complex and 
painful. The ROK has treated us with a certain suspicion 
[ilchonghan pulsin]. Seoul did not understand how Russia would 
develop and how Russia's development would effect the situation 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  What did we do last year? Russia and the DPRK reassessed the 
grounds of relations between the two in 1993. The reassessment 
was made on the line of big changes in Russia, the Korean 
peninsula, and all over the world. We have dissolved the DPRK's 
misgivings that Russia would take a biased policy while adhering 
to the ROK's view on South-North dialogue. We are working with 
Pyongyang in political and economic areas and help in removing 
obstacles to South-North relations. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Kunadze visited Pyongyang last year 
as a special envoy of the Russian president. During this visit, 
Russia and the DPRK agreed to amend treaties on and legal 
grounds of relations between the two countries, including the 
1961 Russia-DPRK treaty, and to resume and activate contacts 
between the two countries' foreign ministries, including 
contacts in the United Nations. 
  In 1993, Russia and the DPRK signed a treaty on scientific 
and technological cooperation and a treaty on cooperation in the 
fishery area. They have continued mutual cooperation in the 
DPRK lumbering business in the Russian territories. I emphasize 
that this is complementary [sangho powanjok] cooperation. We 
will continue such cooperation based on the amended grounds. 
  We are generally satisfied with the development of relations 
between Russia and the ROK. We have developed practical 
[silmujok] cooperation based on the grounds of relations between 
the two countries. We remember that a treaty that secures a new 
atmosphere [sae chuserul hwakposikinun choyak], a lump-sum 
economic agreement, and a series of important documents, and a 
series of other important documents between Russia and the ROK 
were signed when President Yeltsin visited Seoul in November 
1992. 
  We continued political dialogue with the new ROK 
administration of President Kim Yong-sam last year. Based on 
our mutual political understanding, we have solved even problems 
rooted in the past. When I say this, I have a series of 
problems, including the one involving the ROK airliner, which 
was shot down in 1983, in mind. Another series of problems, 
including the one involving the burial of radioactive waste in 
the Sea of Japan, have not yet been solved. 
  We highly assess ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit 
to 
Russia in the summer of 1993. During this visit, Russia and the 
ROK confirmed their mutual interest in the results of Russia-ROK 
relations in various fields, the same view Russia and the ROK 
hold on many world and business issues, and each other's 
willingness to cooperate in resolving those issues. 
  It is more important, however, that contacts of people, 
including sportsmen, art groups, businesses, and scholars, have 
become more active. This reinforced the atmosphere of mutual 
trust not only on the official level but also between the people 
of Russia and the ROK. 
  A schedule of cultural cooperation for 1994 has been signed. 
This has increased the possibility of learning the history, 
culture, and traditions of each other's country. Relations 
between scientific and educational organizations of the two 
countries have been promoted comprehensively, and contacts 
between the two countries' scientific academic organizations. 
Scientific and technological cooperation has also rapidly been 
developed. Hundreds of Russian experts and scholars are working 
in the ROK, and many ROK experts are in Russia. 
  [(Yakovlev) continues] An important aspect of relations 
between Russia and the ROK is economics. Regrettably, the 
relations had a difficult time last year due to the adverse 
economic situation in Russia and decreases in production in the 
ROK. The volume of trade of goods between the two countries 
amounted to $1.5 billion. 
  We plan to start 25 large-scale projects this year after 
overcoming difficulties facing economic cooperation. They 
include construction of an ROK industrial complex in the 
Nakhodka free economic zone and a gas pipeline between Russia 
and the ROK via the DPRK. 
  [Krieto] How do you assess the overall situation on the 
Korean peninsula? 
  [Yakovlev] The situation on the Korean peninsula is very 
complicated. Pyongyang and Seoul signed the Agreement on 
Reconciliation, Nonaggression, and Exchange and Cooperation in 
February 1990. North-South talks and premiers contacts started. 
Regrettably, they discontinued soon because the disagreement on 
mutual inspections and the Washington-Seoul decision to resume 
the Team Spirit military exercise. This issue is now being 
resolved in the course of talks between Washington and 
Pyongyang. We demand that the talks be concluded with success. 
  Russia resolutely opposes nuclear weapons proliferation in 
any form, and we oppose the emergence of nuclear weapons on the 
Korean peninsula. Safeguards are necessary to prevent the 
emergence of nuclear weapons. Safeguards will be ensured when 
the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] rules are 
adhered to strictly. We demand that all (?problems) between the 
DPRK and the IAEA be resolved completely without specific 
national circumstances being considered. 
  We fully support the Joint Declaration on the 
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, signed by the DPRK and 
the ROK. We think this declaration will give impetus to 
Seoul-Pyongyang talks on denuclearization. Russia, China, the 
United States, Japan, and other countries concerned must promote 
a favorable environment for denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, 
alleviating tension, and promoting North-South trust. 
  [Krieto] What do you think of the future of relations 
between Russia and the ROK? 
  [Yakovlev] It is time Russia and the ROK start carrying out 
the various large-scale projects that were agreed on during 
President Yeltsin's visit to the ROK. We are looking forward to 
new summit talks in Moscow this year. We must hold the talks 
based on results from the implementation of the previous 
agreements. 
  We plan to develop cooperation with the DPRK, first, in the 
economic field. The two countries must form a joint committee 
on the treaties existing between them. 
  We must [word indistinct] an organization for regular 
negotiations on urgent issues on the Korean peninsula and 
restructure the DPRK's debt to Russia, which amounts to over 3 
billion rubles at 1990 prices. 
  The repayment of the debt is not an issue that can be 
resolved in a year but must be resolved based on more efficient 
forms of economic cooperation. Collectivization of agriculture 
[words indistinct] is one of them. Experts say we can pool the 
potential of the DPRK, ROK, China, and Russia to develop natural 
resources, build social infrastructures in Russia's Far East, 
and develop the Tumen River estuary bordering Russia, China, and 
Korea. 
  Russia's policy toward the Korean peninsula has also focused 
on improving North-South relations. As President Yeltsin has 
said, the North and South hold the key to national 
reunification. An important task of Russia's policy is to help 
the DPRK and ROK use it. 
  No doubt, Russia's interests on the Korean peninsula can be 
promoted when Russia maintains normal good-neighbor relations 
with the North and South.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva 14 Jan -- The second round of talks on a 
Georgia-Abkhazia settlement, which have more than once 
approached the danger point and threatened to collapse 
altogether, has been successfully completed. The outcome of 
three days of tense debates, continuing virtually around the 
clock, was the adoption of decisions on the more complex 
questions of the Abkhaz drama such as the return of refugees, 
strengthening trust and security, and the use of peacekeeping 
forces. These decisions were included in a communique of the 
meeting that was signed by the heads of the delegations and 
representatives of the United Nations, Russia, and the CSCE. 
  The current round in Geneva, like the previous one from 30 
November to 1 December, was held under the aegis of the United 
Nations, assisted by Russia. The Georgian delegation was headed 
by Jaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Provisional Committee for the 
State of Emergency and deputy of the Georgian Supreme Council, 
and the Abkhazian delegation by Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, chairman 
of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers. 
  Much effort had to be put in by the mediators -- Eduard 
Brunner, the UN secretary general's special envoy, and Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, the head of the Russian 
delegation -- to make the agreement possible. "The talks were 
difficult," the Russian envoy said in an interview with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The main reason was the very acute 
problems that had built up over 18 months of conflict. A great 
deal of blood has been shed and the war has brought misery to 
hundreds of thousands of people. And yet, despite the sharp 
clash of points of view, and when it seemed that a compromise 
was impossible, they were able to achieve a positive outcome to 
the talks, and this is another important step toward a 
full-scale settlement to the conflict in Abkhazia." 
  One of the main results was the commitment endorsed by the 
sides in the communique not to use force and not to resort to 
threats to use it. The sides appealed to the UN Security 
Council to widen the UN Mandate on Supervision in Georgia, which 
requires it to ensure that there is no resumption of 
hostilities. They spoke in favor of deploying UN peacekeeping 
forces or other forces sanctioned by the United Nations in the 
conflict zone, expressing their mutual consent to the use of the 
Russian military contingent in such forces. The deployment of 
the "blue berets" should be followed by the withdrawal of all 
armed formations over the course of five days from the Inguri 
River and other possible zones of confrontation and the 
replacement of them by the peacekeeping forces. All volunteer 
formations and individuals who have come to take part in the 
conflict should be disarmed and withdrawn. 
  A commission for problems of refugees is being set up with 
the participation of representatives of the sides, the United 
Nations, and Russia. It has been decided to start a 
stage-by-stage return of refugees and displaced persons to 
Abkhazia on 10 February -- beginning with Galskiy Rayon. The 
most difficult question -- the future political status of 
Abkhazia -- will be discussed within the framework of the 
previously formed group of experts that will assemble for the 
next meeting in Moscow on 8 February. On 22 February the 
delegations and the international mediators intend to hold a new 
round of talks in Moscow or Geneva. 
  Member of the Georgian delegation Sandro Kavsadze, the 
chairman of Georgia's Committee for Human Rights and Interethnic 
Relations, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the talks had 
made it possible "to move forward toward a settlement." Even 
though the debate was of "very heated and there was a degree of 
confrontation," "on the main issues we reached agreement and 
understanding." 
  Having noted the great importance of the accords, head of 
the 
Abkhaz delegation Sokrat Dzhindzholiya stressed the important 
role of the Russian Federation in a settlement. "Thanks to the 
efforts of the Russian delegation, and of Russia as a whole, a 
great many positive things were achieved," he said in an 
interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. Even before this 
the Russian Federation had been doing everything possible in 
order to bring our positions closer together. Furthermore, life 
itself has, evidently, meant it to take part in the destiny of 
the peoples that were joined by the Soviet Union. There is 
simply no other way out. Neither other countries nor the United 
Nations have the strength or the means to do this. What is 
more, no one knows better than Russia the situation on the 
territory of the former USSR.

  [Text] Kiev, [no date as received] -- At a meeting with 
journalists on 19 January, William Miller, the U.S. ambassador 
to Ukraine, explained his vision of ways of implementing the 
security guarantees given to Ukraine by the United States. "If 
any state carries out an attack on Ukraine or makes territorial 
claims on it, the United States will appeal to international 
organizations such as the United Nations in order to protect 
Ukraine," the U.S. ambassador noted. Talks on disarmament have 
been tense in recent months. Their participants concentrated 
special attention on three issues: Guarantees of Ukraine's 
security, the forms and amounts of compensation for enriched 
uranium contained in warheads, and the rendering of technical 
and economic assistance for the dismantlement of nuclear 
weapons. 
  Replying to questions from journalists, William Miller 
stressed that of the $800 million, which the United States will 
be granting for implementing the program of nuclear disarmament 
of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, our state will 
receive $175 million. The United States also pledged to give 
humanitarian and technical assistance to Ukraine. The 
ambassador reported that a Ukrainian delegation will be leaving 
for the United States next week, which would be engaged in 
issues of coordinating U.S. assistance to Ukraine. At the end 
of the meeting, William Miller expressed the hope that Russia 
and other UN member states would adhere to the charter of this 
organization.

  [Text] Kiev -- The first plenary sitting of the ninth 
session of Ukraine's Supreme Council (the 12th convocation) 
began on 20 January. Twenty people's deputies who had expressed 
their proposals with regard to the three blocks of basic 
problems, took part in discussing the agenda. Parliamentary 
chairman Ivan Plyushch included the issue of the economy and the 
budget, the fight against corruption and abuse, the payment of 
pensions, and raising salaries for workers in education whose 
representatives picketed the Supreme Council this morning, in 
the first block. 
  The second block consists of issues connected to the 
elections in the Crimean Republic. Three hundred and four 
deputies voted to submit the additions to point 7-2 of article 
114-5 of Ukraine's constitution, according to which the 
president of Ukraine would be given the right to repeal "acts of 
the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, ministerial acts, and acts 
of other central bodies of Ukraine's state executive power as 
well as acts of the central bodies of power of the Republic of 
Crimea in the event of their incompatibility with the 
constitution and laws of Ukraine and decrees of Ukraine's 
president." 
  From the third block of issues, concerning nuclear 
disarmament, parliamentary standing commissions on foreign 
affairs, defense, and security, and on legislation and legality 
are to prepare, by 25 January, a resolution on the compatibility 
of the trilateral statement by the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. 
presidents with the earlier adopted parliamentary resolution on 
the ratification of the START I Treaty. 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ukraine's security 
service have been charged with preparing information on the 
course of the investigation into the affair of the attack on the 
Rukh secretariat and the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, 
Rukh's head of secretariat. 
  A report of the special deputies' commission concerning the 
activity of the leadership of the "Blasko-Black Sea Fleet 
concern" will be heard on 26 January 
  A Supreme Council resolution on the renewal of direct radio 
broadcasts of plenary sittings and presentations in the form of 
reports on TV, was adopted. 
  Deputies heard a report from Ukraine's first deputy minister 
of the economy, Valentyn Popov, on the plan of the economic and 
social development for 1994. The speaker gave several indices 
that characterized the state of the economy: national income 
fell by 15 percent compared to 1992; social labor productivity 
fell by 13 percent; the decline of industrial production is 7.4 
percent of last year's level and it took place in more than half 
of industrial enterprises. Last year 16 percent fewer consumer 
goods were manufactured, including foodstuffs (9.4 percent 
fewer) and emission amounted to 12.3 trillion karbovantsi. 
Among the plan's basic directions are structural changes in the 
economy on the basis of state priorities, the attraction of 
investments from all kinds of sources, and the creation, on the 
basis of state ownership, of economic subjects that are fully 
responsible for the consequences of their activity. The Cabinet 
of Ministers is counting on an increase in the rate of the 
karbovanets to 16,000 karbovantsi to the U.S. dollar, 
maintaining prices for coal throughout the year at the level of 
the first quarter of 1994 and an increase in the population's 
money incomes by 5.1 times at a price of 4.45 times. In the 
words of Valentyn Popov, these indices could be achieved by 
conducting a tough credit policy, introducing more flexible 
mechanisms of regulating the consumer fund, developing the 
process of clearing up enterprises' finances [sanatsiya 
pidpryyemstv], privatizing small and medium size enterprises, 
incorporation [korporatyzatsiya] of large enterprises, and 
increasing control over prices at all levels.

Khorog unit, a Tajik Foreign Ministry spokesman told Interfax, 
quoting General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of Russian border 
troops stationed in Tajikistan, as his source. 
  The goal of the attack is to provoke a confrontation between 
Russian border guards and the Badakhshan defense force. 
  According to Chechulin, most defense commanders had said 
that 
they would support the Russian border guards if they are 
attacked. 
  The border guards, local authorities, and Badakhshan defense 
commanders are taking steps to counter such activities aimed at 
destabilizing the region, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

  [Text] Riga, 21 Jan -- On Thursday evening U.S. President 
Bill Clinton telephoned Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis. The 
head of the Baltic state reported on the late night television 
news, "Clinton categorically asserts that he differentiates 
between human rights, citizenship, and the question of the 
withdrawal of Russian troops." The army, said Clinton, must be 
withdrawn within the deadlines set without any kind of 
additional conditions. He spoke of his support for the troop 
withdrawal process and expressed the hope, according to Ulmanis, 
that Latvia will resolve the issues of human rights and 
citizenship in the spirit of the provisions of the CSCE. 
Clinton also stressed "that human rights and citizenship are 
the affair of each state, of each people." "I think," Ulmanis 
noted, "that this is very important for us." 
  During the conversation an exchange of comments took place 
on 
the recent utterances of Andrey Kozyrev. The view of the U.S. 
President, Ulmanis said, "allows Latvia to calm down somewhat." 
However, Ulmanis added, "we should always be prepared for such 
an aggressive policy." 
  According to Ulmanis, Clinton's telephone call "allowed us 
to 
dispel many of the suspicions regarding the talks between the 
United States and Russia."

  [Text] Minsk, Jan 20 (AFP) -- The parliament of Belarus, 
elected during the Soviet era, voted Thursday [20 January] to 
discuss removing parliamentary speaker and head of state 
Stanislav Shushkevich from office, pro-reform deputy Leonid 
Loiko told AFP. 
  The deputies, of whom two-thirds were elected under 
communist 
colours in 1990, accused Shushkevich of contributing to the 
collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 and of delaying 
the return of Belarus to the ruble zone. 
  The closed-session debate on Shushkevich's future will take 
place on Friday, Loiko said. 
  Shushkevich was elected parliamentary speaker, and thus head 
of state, in September 1991, replacing the conservative Nikolay 
Dementey who resigned following the failure of a hardline coup 
attempt in Moscow the previous month. 
  Along with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, Boris 
Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, he signed an accord, prepared at 
Brest but known as the Minsk Agreement, in December 1991, 
declaring the end of the Soviet Union and the creation of the 
loosely constituted Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  The Belarus deputies also discussed the possible dismissal 
of 
Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Interior Minister Vladimir 
Yegorov, secret service chief Eduard Shirkovskiy and state 
prosecutor Vasiliy Sholodonov, the Baltic News Service reported.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Rebrov: "Russia Is a Great Space Power. </F>
And Its Partners Should Remember That"] 
  [Text] It is 19 years since the joint flight by the Soyuz 
and Apollo spaceships. The project, which was known as ASTP 
[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project], inspired great hopes for an 
expansion of cooperation, but in all the years since July 1975 
that process has been sluggish, unless you count individual 
episodic and not particularly notable upsurges. How do the 
cards now lie in the international game of patience, what moves 
can be expected from the main space powers -- Russia and the 
United States? 
  Back in the fall of last year the question was hanging in 
the 
air, but by mid-December there had been developments: A program 
was defined, consisting of 10 flights by U.S. shuttle spaceships 
to our Mir complex. Over that period, U.S. astronauts are 
supposed to spend a total of around two years working at our 
space station, catching up with our experience of prolonged 
space expeditions. The date has also been set for the launch of 
a shuttle with Russian cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev on board. The 
week-long flight is planned for the first days of February 1994. 
  Cooperation has always been beneficial, especially in such a 
large-scale and costly matter as space exploration. This 
problem is common to all mankind, and must be tackled by joint 
efforts. But is this partnership always equal? 
  Partnership and the market are interrelated concepts. The 
international market in space technologies has been in existence 
for more than 15 years now, and competition here is as tough as 
on any other international market. The proportions are roughly 
like this: Western Europe's share is 60-65 percent, and that of 
the United States is 30-35 percent. The share of Russia, the 
biggest space power, is laughably small -- less than half a 
percent. Given this correlation, a powerful lever is in the 
hands of the United States, and it does not want to let go of 
it. In a situation in which the supply of satellite launch 
services is 2.5 times consumer demand (disregarding Russia), it 
is clinging to everything so as not to get crowded out. So the 
ideas of partnership are pushed into the background, while, by 
way of justification in the eyes of the world community, all 
kinds of stories are circulated about "Russia's technological 
backwardness." 
  But among the many different opinions there are some sober 
assessments, too. Experts note: "Let us be realistic: The 
former USSR still accounts for two-thirds of the world's 
launches." But the number of launches is not the point. 
Russia's space industry, although inferior to America's in 
terms of electronics, has the lead in a number of technologies. 
We have today's most powerful booster rocket, with a highly 
sophisticated first stage; we have the world's only active 
long-term orbital multimodular space station; we have developed 
a unique nuclear reactor capable of generating power in space, 
which is compact, relatively powerful, and reliable; we have 
developed plasma motors, used to change the orbits of space 
devices.... One could also mention other up-to-date equipment, 
which is potentially of value for states exploring space. 
Moreover, our scientists, who possess experience without equal 
in the world, hold in their hands a "bank of knowledge," which 
other countries cannot manage without. "Just as the American 
space research program drew so much from the experience of 
German scientists after World War II, so today it could gain 
from the Russians' participation," the INTERNATIONAL HERALD 
TRIBUNE stresses. 
  Let us admit that Russia has plenty of difficulties. But 
these are times for those who not only try to survive at all 
costs, but also venture forth boldly and intelligently, without 
losing their national pride and dignity. The Americans have 
problems of their own. Their Freedom orbital station project, 
according to experts' comments, has become like a woolen 
sweater, which was washed in hot water. First it began to 
shrink (number of cosmonauts on board, equipment, power supply, 
and so forth) like a comet approaching the sun. Then the idea 
of totally abandoning further research arose. The reason -- 
"budget constraints." But is that the only reason? 
  At the latest session of the Russian-American commission for 
economic cooperation, important documents concerning space were 
discussed and signed. They deal, in particular, with the Alpha 
orbital station, conceived as a prestige program for the turn of 
the century. The construction of the vast orbital complex will 
take approximately five years. It is proposed to begin work in 
1997 and complete it by 2001, after which the full-scale 
operation of the station is planned. Its life is expected to be 
10-15 years. 
  Of course, participation in such a large-scale project is 
prestigious. Yes, it means access to leading technologies. 
Yes, it means a sensible integration of efforts and resources. 
Yes, it means useful orders for many of our firms in the space 
sector (some 200 of our enterprises will be involved in the 
Alpha project, and that is 60,000-70,000 people). But is this 
cooperation entirely cloudless? Is there not a danger of ending 
up back at square one, as the saying goes? 
  Let us look at the problem objectively, without emotion or 
embellishment. It is no secret that Russian standards for 
life-support systems for space devices (as the ASTP project 
showed) do not coincide with America's. The same is true of 
standards for a number of technical parameters, and in 
particular for relay satellites. The Alpha station's 
inclination of plane of orbit is 51.6 degrees (for Mir it is 65 
degrees), and that means that it will be possible to observe 
only 7 percent of Russia's territory from on board. 
  The reality today is this: Of the heavy booster rockets 
available in the world, only Russia's Energiya is capable of 
putting the future Alpha's modules into space, and this will be 
far cheaper than if the mission was entrusted to shuttles. The 
Americans have not yet been able (or willing) to assess the 
merits of our Protons and Zenits. Added to that, there is the 
experience of Russian experts and cosmonauts in supporting 
prolonged space expeditions, without which the very idea of 
long-term stations with changing crews becomes pointless. The 
implementation of such a large-scale project in a relatively 
short time would be practically impossible without Russia's 
participation and the use of its space experience and industrial 
potential. So the present cooperation, with a $400-million 
advance, is not charity, but payment for our labor, and very 
modest payment at that. That is why further thought should be 
given to the advantages. 
  Russia's participation in the Alpha project (incidentally, 
the name "Sigma" would have been more apposite, as a symbol of 
integration) in conjunction with the Americans will require 
considerable expenditure. It is naive to think that we will be 
paid generously in hard currency for all our work. The 
accounting system works like this: You put such-and-such a sum 
into the "common purse," and you receive a proportion of the 
"resources." If the balance tips in one direction you are owed 
something, if in the other direction, you must pay to enjoy the 
"common asset." In general this is a perfectly sensible 
principle in accordance with market norms. But what are the 
legal and other guarantees that we will not give more than we 
get? Today we are prepared to hand over for next to nothing 
something that took years to create, that has a value. A 
considerable value. So let us be prudent, proud, and 
intelligent. And then cooperation in space will be a good thing 
both for us and for others.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetsky] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau January 21 TASS -- Moldovan Premier Andrei 
Sangheli said on Friday that an economic union, now being 
created by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), should 
become an alternative to the European Union [EU] in future. 
  According to the prime minister, Moldova has always favoured 
an economic union of the Commonwealth countries, since neither 
Russia, nor Ukraine, nor still Moldova can compete with the 
European Economic Community single-handed. 
  The European Union countries want the former Soviet 
republics 
to form their own economic space, their market and their 
production, Sangeli said, stressing that the eastern market is 
responsible for the lion's share of the Moldovan export. 
  The prime minister called the industrial slump the main 
difficulty in carrying out economic reforms in Moldova. "If our 
economy had accomplished the 1990 results, it would be easier to 
carry out reforms," he said. "When we carry out good reforms, 
but living standards drop, people will not understand such a 
government."

  [Text] After a meeting in Moscow between Andrey Kozyrev, 
head of the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, and foreign 
ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia Gasan Gasanov and Vahan 
Papazyan, chances have emerged for talks to be held between 
President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan and President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan of Armenia with the mediation of Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin on 25 January in Moscow. It is not certain that 
they will take place on the date scheduled, however, because 
Yerevan and Baku have not yet made a final decision. 
  Tofik Abbasov, head of the Azerbaijan presidential apparatus 
press service, told SEGODNYA's correspondent that the meeting 
depends on whether the expert commission formed with 
representatives of Russian, Armenian, and Azerbaijan Foreign 
Ministries will complete its work. Furthermore, Mr. Abbasov 
noted that the president will come to the meeting if he has the 
time. Baku, however, welcomes Russia's initiative and will soon 
make its final decision known. 
  Yerevan's attitude to the scheduled Moscow meeting is 
essentially the same. The press service of the Armenian 
presidential apparatus told SEGODNYA's correspondent that "this 
question will be decided in the very near future." 
  Such a position by Yerevan and Baku suggests that the 
meeting 
between presidents Ter-Petrosyan and Aliyev set for 25 January 
may not take place or may be moved to a later date. 
  At present both warring sides understand the impossibility 
of 
resolving the Karabakh conflict militarily. The upcoming 
meeting, however, even if it does take place, will be hardly 
capable of putting an end to the Karabakh issue because Baku 
will never agree to the loss of part of its territory, while the 
self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic will not want to lose 
its unrecognized independence. At present there is no 
compromise option that would suit both sides. Therefore, 
chances are that no peace agreement will be concluded between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan any time soon.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences Anatoliy </F>
Komissarov, adviser to the International Reform Fund, and 
Candidate of Economic Sciences Vera Shirobokova, consultant for 
the International Reform Fund: "The Ruble: One for All, or All 
for One?"] 
  [Text] The story of the ruble zone's creation and 
disintegration clearly reflects the inconsistency of Russia's 
policy regarding economic cooperation with the former Soviet 
republics. For two years now, decisions have been adopted on 
the need for closer integration within the CIS framework and the 
creation of an economic union, which remain nothing more than 
good intentions. 
  As a result of a series of bilateral agreements being signed 
in August-October 1992, as well as the multilateral Agreement 
"On a Unified Monetary System and Coordinated Monetary, Credit, 
and Currency Policy of States Retaining the Ruble As Legal 
Tender," the creation of a ruble zone incorporating nine states 
was proclaimed. They were: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The ruble was acknowledged to be 
the only legal tender in states within the ruble zone. 
  In January 1993, heads of state adopted the decision to set 
up the Interstate Ruble Zone Bank, of which all countries in the 
ruble zone were founders. It was to carry out multilateral 
transactions on a clearing basis. However, agreement was not 
reached on two fundamental issues when drafting the bank's 
statute: Which ruble would be the common currency -- the 
Russian ruble or a supranational ruble -- and how decisions 
would be made in the bank's council. 
  Another agreement -- on practical measures to set up a new 
type of ruble zone -- was signed in September 1993 by six 
states: In addition to Russia, the signatories were Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, Armenia, Belarus, and Tajikistan. 
  In practice, however, Russia's commitment -- declared at 
summit level interstate meetings -- to strengthening integration 
processes within the CIS framework amounts to transferring 
economic relations with the former Soviet republics to its 
general system of foreign economic relations. 
  To a certain extent, these actions by the Russian 
authorities 
have objective foundation, as the newly independent states are 
trying quite hard to obtain raw materials and energy on 
preferential terms within the framework of closer economic 
cooperation; they are also endeavoring to resolve the problem of 
clearing the debt facing Russia in a way that is advantageous to 
themselves. 
  This kind of simplified approach is a breeding ground for 
negative attitudes to reintegration in a number of Russian 
federal departments, which take an equally simplified view of 
protecting Russia's interests, bringing the problem of 
equivalent commodity exchange to the fore. 
  The majority of economists admit that, from the point of 
view 
of Russia's strategic state interests, in the long term the 
policy of reintegration within the CIS framework is the only 
right policy to follow, for a whole number of objective reasons. 
The most important of these is the need to smooth over the 
consequences of the breakup of the USSR in the economic sphere, 
as they have considerably aggravated the crisis in all the 
states concerned. 
  Russia has gradually taken an increasingly tough stand on 
the question of the ruble zone. Its terms for those wishing to 
remain in this zone have become increasingly unacceptable to 
them, and this has in fact forced the states which originally 
signed the agreements on setting up a new type of ruble zone to 
introduce their own currencies. 
  The explanation for Russia's tough policy given by those who 
support it is that it must protect its own economic interests, 
as combining the monetary systems of Russia and the other five 
states could cause a surge of inflation and an increase in 
Russia's trade deficit with these countries; it would also make 
it practically impossible for Russia to retrieve debts from 
these countries. 
  There is no doubt that the newly independent states' 
different levels of development, supply of natural resources, 
and pace of transformations are an objective impediment to the 
reintegration of their economies. However, this has never been 
a secret to the Russian leadership. Nevertheless, it has not 
prevented it from concluding treaties and agreements on economic 
integration within the CIS framework.... 
  A fairly recent session of the CIS Coordination and 
Consultation Committee essentially announced that the idea of a 
ruble zone has been abandoned and that the CIS countries now 
recognize each other's national currency. The transition to 
multicurrency conditions of operation in the CIS is being 
broadly publicized: a free trade zone; a customs union; a 
common market of goods, labor, and capital; and a currency and 
economic union. 
  But in the absence of a real money and currency market, the 
CIS countries' national currency exchange rates can be for 
transfer purposes only and do not in themselves signify the 
restoration of equivalent exchange. 
  Unfortunately, we are seeing a repetition of the old 
practice 
whereby agreements are signed -- and only then do the parties 
involved begin to try to develop a mechanism to implement those 
agreements. For example, it has been announced that a payments 
union between Russia and Kazakhstan will be formed in the near 
future, although no decision has been made regarding a key issue 
in the formation of this union: Namely, the question of tying 
quotations for Kazakhstan's currency to the dollar or some other 
freely convertible currency. Despite the fact that it is 
acquiring fundamental importance. 
  The introduction of national currencies to payment relations 
cannot in itself solve the serious problem of balancing mutual 
payments and nonpayments. We can hardly expect Russian 
enterprises to be interested in obtaining their partners' som or 
tenge, with which they certainly will not always be able to 
acquire the goods they need in these or in other former Soviet 
republics. Consequently, there is a visible prospect of 
transactions remaining bilateral in nature and barter being 
employed everywhere, which will still further reduce the 
market's capacity and make enterprises' activity even more 
difficult. 
  Failure to solve this problem could make mutual payments for 
supplies of goods still more complicated and ultimately lead to 
a further reduction in commodity exchange. This would mean that 
Russia would not receive raw materials and components from the 
former republics and at the same time experience difficulties 
with the sale of its own products, which, in turn, would lead to 
a further decline in Russia's output and, as a consequence of 
this, an increase in unemployment and social tension. A policy 
of "economic pressure" on Russia's partners in the former Soviet 
republics, as some Russian leaders suggest, would hardly help in 
this respect. We must also take into account that, if Russia 
were to pursue a very tough economic policy in relation to its 
partners, sooner or later its place would be taken by other 
countries. 
  Moreover, in order to effectively protect Russia's economy 
against negative influences from the former Soviet republics 
(the transfer of large amounts of rubles, the reexport of 
Russian goods, and so forth), we must urgently equip our borders 
with every facility, which seems an unrealistic prospect at 
present. 
  So, the new type of ruble zone has been left behind in the 
past. However, the problems in relations between the newly 
independent states still remain and are intensifying. The 
course of setting up an economic union is now being pursued, 
although implementation has been put off for quite some time. 
One factor of considerable importance in this respect is that 
our CIS partners' confidence in Russian policy has been 
undermined as a result of its vagueness and inconsistency.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 21 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Moscow 
newspapers focus on the results of the week-long work of the 
Russian parliament State Duma (lower chamber) and the Russian 
government reshuffle. Commenting on the present balance of 
forces at the State Duma, TRUD newspaper notes that "the first 
voting results showed that three factions --the Russian Agrarian 
Party, the Communist Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party 
(165 votes) -- cooperate at least in settling personnel issues." 
  It is difficult to appraise the interests of the "New 
Regional Policy" group: they will emerge when political and 
economic issues are settled. In any case, reformist blocs 
(poorly united between themselves) which have only 133 votes, 
should be interested in cooperation with the above group and 
with the Women of Russia faction. 
  Commenting on the regulations affecting the working and 
living conditions of State Duma members which were discussed by 
the Duma on Thursday, the same newspaper writes that "the debate 
on material maintenance of deputies graphically showed how 
strong the conviction is in our country that it is more 
convenient to care for people's interests, enjoying the salary 
of a federal minister and looking at the world through the 
window of a personal car." 
  Referring to the calculations done by the experts from 
Russia's Choice group within the Duma, IZVESTIYA notes that in 
keeping with what the State Duma deputies are planning, the 
monthly upkeep of one people's deputy will cost the taxpayer 15 
million rubles. The paper quotes the views of Russia's Choice on 
this issue: "If, despite everything, such a decision is finally 
taken, it must, in the current economic conditions, be regarded 
as irresponsible and not conducive to increasing the prestige of 
the highest body of legislative authority". 
  IZVESTIYA also criticizes the personnel changes within the 
Russian government. "So, Viktor Chernomyrdin has made his 
choice: Soskovets, Zaveryukha, Chubays, and Yarov. He may, of 
course, be wrong," the paper writes. The paper says that the 
team of deputy prime ministers thus selected "bears witness, 
first and foremost, to the fact that the prime minister no 
longer wishes to listen to what the president has to say, laying 
claims to the role of not just an independent, but, possibly, a 
stronger political figure." 
  Forecasting that the new government will to some extent 
distance itself from the previous reform course, ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI says that the main question is "the extent of this 
distancing and whether the government and its chairman are going 
to have enough will and common sense to halt this process before 
it passes the danger mark. There are serious grounds for alarm. 
For instance, Chernomyrdin's statement on the readiness to 
cooperate with the Duma has taken on an altogether new meaning 
after a majority of the lower chamber's committees dealing with 
the economy and economics turned out to be in the hands of the 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], all the more so if 
the Duma's intention to set aside a special hour once a week to 
examine the work of the government is taken into account." 
  IZVESTIYA informs its readers that the Russian procurator- 
general's office is studying the possibility of instituting a 
criminal case against legislator Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader 
of the LDPR. 
  The newspaper writes that "the administration for the 
observance of laws on federal security and ethnic relations of 
the Russian procurator-general's office is completing its study 
of applications by citizens and mass organizations demanding 
that Zhirinovskiy be criminally prosecuted for war propaganda in 
his book `The Last Leap to the South' as well as in interviews 
and television statements." 
  Newspapers report some particulars about a land-crash of an 
Antei military transport plane near the city of Tver (some 200 
km northwest of Moscow) on 19 January. Noting that reasons for 
the crash were not fully investigated yet, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
and PRAVDA newspapers claim that there was no explosion aboard 
the plane. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes in this connection 
that "all three `black boxes' of the plane were found." 
Specialists affirm that the plane's control systems failed. 
  Noting that today is the 70th commemoration day of Vladimir 
Lenin's death, PRAVDA carries an article entitled "What 
`Democrats' Are Like and How They Fight Leninism." 
  The article criticizes the entire road covered by the Soviet 
Union and then by Russia, starting from the course for 
restructuring proclaimed by Mikhail Gorbachev and ending with 
the course for reforms pursued by the present Russian 
leadership.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 22 TASS -- Major newspapers highlight 
today the latest session of the new Russian Cabinet of Ministers 
and the situation on the Russian currency market. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA points out in this connection that, with 
the exception of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, the make-up of 
the new government is almost the same as that of the previous 
one. "If one bears in mind Gaydar's words that he could not 
influence the government's policy of late, as well as the fact 
that Fedorov said about the same thing, one may come to the 
conclusion that what we are having now is just the old cabinet, 
but free from political contradictions and psychological 
conflicts," the newspaper writes. "However, it is the old 
cabinet that was pursuing the reform policy without much success 
and without any system. Consequently, the old- new government, 
hastily made up, will pretty soon have either to be really 
renewed, or to renew (or rather define) its programme." 
  Commenting on the resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov, the 
newspaper stresses that "all this produces the impression of a 
step, calculated beforehand." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes with 
reference to Boris Fedorov and Leonid Abalkin, a well-known 
economist: "A dramatic growth of inflation in the first quarter 
of this year was inevitable, and no government, whatever its 
make-up, could prevent it. It is noteworthy in this connection 
that both Yegor Gaydar, the 'motive force' of the reform, and 
Boris Fedorov, its ideologist, preferred to wash their hands of 
it and not to link themselves with the government any longer. 
Now that the radical democrats freed themselves of 
responsibility for the situation in the Russian economy, it is 
obvious that the renewed government will be held responsible for 
the overall economic disintegration." 
  Commenting on the reorganisation of the government, 
IZVESTIYA 
writes that "the prime minister left the cabinet almost without 
the architects and active supporters of the previous policy and, 
at the same time, announced that the reform course would remain 
unchanged." The newspaper quotes the prime minister as saying 
that "we shall fight inflation by non-monetarist methods." "If 
the invariability of the policy consists in the transfer from 
monetarist to non- monetarist methods of fighting inflation, 
then new people will be really needed in the government. The 
impression is that we are on the threshold of a major turn 
towards old times." 
  Pointing to the relative stabilisation of the Russian 
currency market, IZVESTIYA writes that the hope for the 
stabilisation of the exchange rate is based on the dramatic 
reduction of the demand for hard currency at the latest auction. 
"It stood at 67,100,000 dollars, while since the beginning of 
the year it had been almost all the time on the level of 150 
million dollars. The inevitable result of the rush with the 
purchasing of hard currency was the depletion of the ruble 
resources of all participants in currency transactions. It is 
not accidental that only 66 banks took part in the latest 
auction, while the usual figure is 83-85." 
  "Personal changes in the government invariably reflect 
political changes," KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes. Analysing the 
political situation in the country, the newspaper comes to the 
conclusion that, most probably, we shall witness in the future 
"the Ukrainian version of runaway inflation, the curtailment of 
production in all industries, the coming to power of a 'tough 
guy' and, in the long run, the retreat to previous positions." 
  "Now there are grounds to believe that the cabinet has 
shifted from the right-wing liberal flank to the right-wing 
centre," PRAVDA writes. "Will the everyday work of the 
government confirm this supposition? If so, is it possible to 
say that we are witnessing the beginning of the political drift 
of state power towards the left and that it is coming closer to 
the real interests of working people?" "A lot of questions might 
be asked, but one thing is clear: the monetarist idea has lost 
its value." 
  Touching upon the issues of the reorganisation of the 
government, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA points out that "although Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said he had had no special 
differences with the president, many observers believe that they 
did have a clash over the government make-up, which may trigger 
another political crisis in the top echelon. Even today many 
people regard Chernomyrdin as a politician, who is claiming an 
independent role in the political arena." 
  TRUD frontpages an article dealing with the investigation 
into the crash of the Tu-154m plane belonging to the Baykal Air 
Company, that took place near Irkutsk on January 3. "The results 
of the work of the government commission will soon be made 
public. One thing is clear already: some time ago an utterly 
unwise decision was taken on the dissolution of Gosavianadzor, a 
unique control body. It actually kept under control the 
take-off of every plane. The dissolution of Gosavianadzor made 
passenger flights a very dangerous undertaking." 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA carry materials dealing with 
the 70th anniversary of Lenin's death. "On January 21 numerous 
representatives of communist and workers' parties, the young 
communist league (Komsomol), war and labour veterans, Muscovites 
and guests of the Russian capital came to the Red Square to pay 
tribute of respect to Lenin," PRAVDA writes.

  [Text] Moscow January 24 ITAR-TASS -- "Russia's reviewed 
government after all reshuffles and personal losses is dominated 
by former members of the Soviet government led by Ryzhkov and 
Pavlov," according to Yevgeniy Kiselev, the host of the Sunday 
television analytical programme Itogi. 
  Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin said in an interview with the 
same programme it would be wrong to speak about a change in the 
government policy. "The question is that we are entering a new 
period, a new phase of the economic policy, and this new phase 
means that we must do thorough, routine work, hard work. It is 
impossible to promise an abrupt improvement of overall 
performance in three or six months, the vice-premier stressed. 
  Itogi also interviewed Boris Fedorov who declined to join 
the 
new government as finance minister. He said it was impossible 
to continue "a normal economic policy" as long as Viktor 
Gerashchenko remained the chairman of the Central Bank of 
Russia. According to Fedorov, inflation in Russia will soon 
reach at least 30 per cent a month. 
  Responding to a question about his possible role in the 
parliament to which he had been elected Fedorov said he intended 
to engage in "constructive criticism of the government but not 
in political gambling. The interests of the state are above 
all". 
  Fedorov categorically denied rumours that he had met the 
U.S. 
ambassador in Moscow a short time ago to ask him for a job. 
  Both Itogi and the independent television analytical 
programme Voskresenye discussed the recent drop in the rouble 
exchange value against the dollar after January 13. According 
to experts, the panic buying was provoked by two main factors: 
the end-of-the-year and payments aimed at offsetting inflation 
and Yegor Gaydar's resignation. 
  Asked by Itogi about his view on the plummeting of the 
rouble 
last week, Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said that 
the fall was due to "several factors, both economic and 
political". Gerashchenko stressed that the resignation of Gaydar 
and Fedorov "cannot mean a change in the policy which is 
objectively necessary". 
  The Central Bank chairman said inflation in January and 
February would amount to approximately 20 per cent, and may 
reach 25 per cent in February when debts to some industries will 
have to be paid. He said the debts have reached 2.5 trillion 
roubles.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov; from the </F>
"Commonwealth Update" program] 
  [Text] Statements by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev that countries of the CIS and the Baltic states are 
regions of Russian vital interests had a somewhat strange 
response in Washington. A State Department spokesman said the 
United States wished to get explanations. Explanations were 
given, yet some feeling of perplexity over the first response 
remains. Vladislav Kozyakov has been looking into the matter 
and has written the following: 
  What we found surprising was the haste with which the 
American official spokesman expressed his displeasure with the 
Russian minister's statement. The State Department spokesman 
did not have the full text of Andrey Kozyrev's statement made at 
a Moscow conference on Russian policy on the territory of the 
former USSR. All he had was brief reports for news agencies. 
That, however, did not stop him from reproaching Russian 
policy. Moreover, the American official interpreted quite 
freely Kozyrev's statement about the need of a Russian military 
presence in the territory and even claimed it contradicted what 
the Russian spokesman said at the recent summit in Moscow. 
  But where has this hasty desire to put to doubt the 
political 
course of Russia come from? This question is to the point to 
ask, especially in the light of the Moscow summit, which was 
marked by a further strengthening of the Russian-American 
partnership. Washington's hasty response to Andrey Kozyrev's 
statement can serve as a reminder that even at the current 
high-level of cooperation between Moscow and Washington, the 
American side sometimes displays signs of the past policy of 
double standards. The realities of today, when the CIS has 
emerged in the territory of the former Soviet Union and when the 
Baltic independent states have come into existence, have quite a 
few specific features. One of the most important is to preserve 
centuries-old contacts between Russia and its immediate 
neighbors. It is therefore natural that Moscow regards them as 
a region of primary vital interest. 
  Incidentally, the Americans also have such a notion. For 
example, they include into the zone of their national interest 
the countries of Central America and the Caribbean basin. On 
these grounds, as is known, the United States resorted to 
military intervention, for example, in Panama, Grenada, and a 
number of other countries. The United States has imposed a 
trade blockade and used other sanctions against some of the 
countries of that region. As for Russia, it builds its 
relations with the CIS countries and Baltic states on the basis 
of respect of international law. And if Russia maintains its 
military presence in, say, Tajikistan, Georgia, or some other 
Commonwealth country, it does it fully in accordance with 
bilateral agreement. 
  As far as the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and 
Estonia is concerned, negotiations on the issue are under way. 
At the same time, Russia is pressing for respect of human 
rights, the rights of the millions of Russian speakers living in 
the CIS countries. And Moscow says it is ready to act firmly if 
the rights of Russian speakers are abused. Understanding of 
Russia's vital interests in the countries, former Soviet 
republics, is essential for maintaining its partnership with the 
United States, as well as other countries.

presidents was held at the Defense Ministry today. Leading 
Russian nuclear disarmament specialists expressed real fears 
about the condition of the Ukrainian nuclear arsenal. The 
stockpiles are overloaded, the personnel are poorly trained, and 
proper servicing is not carried out. Given this situation, 
Russian plants are prepared to dismantle all Ukrainian warheads 
within two years. The ball is now in the Ukrainian leadership's 
court. [Video shows warships in harbor, under construction]

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "Why Russia Is Concerned"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry held a press 
conference for Russian and foreign journalists devoted to the 
military-political aspects of the Russian and U.S. presidents' 
Moscow summit meeting. Leading experts in the nuclear missile 
sphere -- Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief of a Russian 
Defense Ministry main directorate; Major General Anatoliy 
Svetikov, first deputy chief of the Strategic Missile Forces 
Main Staff Operational Directorate; Major General Anatoliy 
Lukyanov, deputy chief of the Russian Defense Ministry 
International Treaty Directorate; and Boris Gorobets, spokesman 
for the Ministry of Atomic Energy -- answered journalists' 
questions. 
  They all revealed the complexity not only of the 
military-political, but also of the military-technical aspects 
of the problem of the nuclear potential in Ukraine and once 
again underlined not only the political significance of the 
tripartite agreement on eliminating these weapons, but also the 
considerable contribution it makes to strengthening nuclear 
security -- provided that the matter is resolved positively. 
Col. Gen. Yevgeniy Maslin reminded the press conference that it 
is a question of around 1,300 warheads [boyegolovka] for SS-19 
and SS-24 missiles and 600 air-launched cruise missile warheads 
[golovnaya boyevaya chast]. The general said that this arsenal 
causes most profound concern in Russia. 
  The point is that the state of these warheads is still 
deteriorating. The warranty periods of most of the munitions' 
components are expiring and they are not undergoing the 
requisite technical maintenance, while maintenance personnel 
lack the requisite level of both theoretical and practical 
training. The complexity of the situation is indicated not 
least by the fact that three warheads were recently delivered to 
Russia from Ukraine in a preaccident state. 
  Our country does indeed have the technology to dismantle and 
salvage the nuclear munitions, but time is pressing on. It is 
no coincidence that it was specifically said during the summit 
meeting that the first consignment of 200 warheads must arrive 
at the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy enterprises for 
elimination within the next 10 months. 
  Nor has Kiev's desire for material compensation been 
forgotten -- in exchange for the aforementioned first 
[consignment of] 200 warheads Ukraine will receive 100 fuel 
assemblies for nuclear power stations from Russia. Further 
payments are to be determined. If that does not seem enough to 
Ukraine, it was said at the press conference, the following 
legitimate question arises: Perhaps Ukraine does not want to 
part with its nuclear arms, contrary to its own declarations? 
  The press conference did not overlook the problem of mutual 
nontargeting of strategic nuclear missiles, enshrined in the 
Moscow declaration signed by Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton. 
When asked by your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent whether this 
clause contravenes the status of nuclear weapons as a means of 
deterring an aggressor (as in the "Basic Provisions of Russian 
Federation Military Doctrine") Generals Anatoliy Lukyanov and 
Anatoliy Svetikov replied that our nuclear arsenal does, of 
course, retain the functions of deterrence and intimidation. 
The fact that the missiles will not be targeted at the United 
States and Russia, respectively, in everyday life, a sign of the 
new quality of the partnership relations between the two 
countries, is another matter. Because the missiles nonetheless 
remain on alert duty, we can always resume the possibility of 
their combat use if necessary.

"Nuclear Weapons in Kiev Are in an Inadequate Condition"] 
  [Text] Addressing a press conference at the Russian 
Federation defense conference yesterday, which was devoted to 
the military aspects of the visit by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief of the Defense 
Ministry's Main Directorate, said that Russia will be ready 
within a year to evacuate to its territory all nuclear warheads 
stationed in Ukraine to be dismantled. As of now 176 ICBM 
launching pads are located in Ukraine, including 130 SS-19 and 
46 SS-24 units. Overall Kiev has 1,300 ICBM warheads and 600 
air-based cruise missile warheads. Having given a positive 
assessment of the signing of the trilateral 
Russian-Ukrainian-U.S. agreement on the abolition of Kiev's 
nuclear potential, General Maslin stated that it is 
impermissible to mark time on the evacuation and dismantling of 
the nuclear missiles. The beginning of this process now depends 
on the Ukrainian parliament, which is to ratify the trilateral 
agreement. Should it not be approved by the Ukrainian 
lawmakers, there may be unpredictable consequences. Nuclear 
munition storages are over-filled, which has already led to 
enhanced radiation backgrounds. The shelf life of most nuclear 
missile components have run out; part of the charges are in a 
near-emergency condition, while the level of emergency response 
crews shows that in the event of an explosion or leakage they 
will not be able to handle the consequences. "There are 
people," Maslin said, "who do not understand this danger." But 
there are also others who appreciate the threat but do not wish 
to help the abolition, either because they are playing the 
nuclear card or are unwilling to part with their chairs in state 
structures which they obtained after Ukraine assumed 
jurisdiction over the nuclear weapons of the former USSR located 
on its territory.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Chubarov and </F>
Denis Perkin] 
  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- Ukrainian agreement to 
dismantle and store nuclear warheads from SS-24 missiles within 
ten months is one of the few results of the 
Russian-Ukrainian-U.S. negotiations, President of the National 
Security and International Relations Center Sergey Rogov told a 
briefing here today. 
  Rogov criticized the agreement, saying "commentaries 
claiming 
the tripartite statement on nuclear arms removes all problems 
related to nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory are 
too hasty". 
  In his words, the major drawback of the document is that it 
is not concrete. It carries no schedule of nuclear arms 
withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. If there is no withdrawal 
before the conference on non-proliferation of nuclear arms due 
to be held in 1995, the international community will face 
serious problems in discussion of the Non-Proliferation Treaty's 
future and a possibility of its joining by China, Israel and 
North Korea, stressed Rogov. 
  Even if Ukraine withdraws 176 intercontinental ballistic 
missiles and 1,500 warheads declared in the statement, it will 
not be able to sign the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear 
arms. In the words of Rogov, Ukraine has another 670 nuclear 
warheads from air-based missiles and gravity bombs.

<F P=106> [Article by Vera Shirobokova, adviser to "Reforma" </F>
international fund: "Going Halves With the Ruble. Belarus's 
Joining the Ruble Zone in the Interests of the Two Countries"] 
  [Text] The mass media have recently carried a whole series 
of reports on Belarus's joining the ruble zone. The agreement 
is regarded as extremely unfavorable to Russia. This, however, 
does not square with reality, to put it mildly. If only because 
no agreement has yet been signed and, accordingly, the terms 
have not been decided. 
  There is only the intention of two friendly countries to 
create such a union, and its framework terms have been decided. 
The agreement itself, recording the basic principles for 
uniting the monetary systems, is still being prepared. 
  For it is only possible to unite monetary systems if the two 
countries have tough, coordinated price, credit, tax, and budget 
policies. This also presupposes the presence of a single 
emission center in the united ruble zone, a switch to unified 
discount rates for central bank credits, and the implementation 
of a unified currency policy in respect of third countries. 
  Opponents of Belarus's joining the ruble zone believe that 
this will have lots of highly negative consequences for the 
Russian economy. But is this so? 
  We must obviously start looking for the answer by assessing 
Russia's strategic interests -- both economic and geopolitical. 
Nobody any longer disputes the existence of such interests. The 
question is different: Does closer economic integration with 
Belarus accord with these interests? It undoubtedly does. 
  In the long term, from the viewpoint of Russia's strategic 
state interests, the policy of reintegration with all the CIS 
countries, including Belarus, is the only correct one because of 
a whole number of objective reasons. 
  The most important of these is the smoothing of the 
consequences of the USSR's breakup in the economic sphere, which 
significantly deepened the crisis in all the states, including 
Russia. The former Union republics are the traditional market 
where Russia's output is competitive. Imports of raw materials 
and subassemblies from these countries also cannot be quickly 
replaced by Russian production or imports. In this sense 
Russia's losses from the breaking of ties clearly are not 
comparable with the possible expense of arranging trade and 
economic relations with partners in the CIS. 
  All this, apart from Russia's dependence on imported raw 
materials, also applies fully to Belarus. A whole range of 
production facilities are concentrated there which are either 
absent in Russia (heavy quarry dump trucks, for example) or 
which produce output that is superior to analogous Russian 
output in terms of its technical and economic parameters 
(Belarus tractors). In addition, many Russian enterprises are 
linked with Belarusian ones by collaborative deliveries. 
Transit oil and gas pipelines pass over this state's territory 
to Europe, as do railroads and roads. Belarus has a relatively 
developed foreign trade infrastructure (customs, warehouses, 
transshipment bases), and Russia is extremely interested in 
using it. 
  The provision of facilities on its own western borders is 
too 
much of a luxury, given Russia's present economic position. In 
addition, there have been very great losses in paying for 
Russian freight to transit Belarusian territory. 
  Of course, the Belarusian market is also very large and 
attractive from the viewpoint of selling Russian output (and not 
just raw materials). It is plainly not in Russia's interests to 
surrender this market to other countries. 
  Now about the negative consequences which might affect the 
Russian economy as a result of merging the two countries' 
monetary systems. These are undoubtedly possible if the 
mechanism of this merger is not worked out. 
  The paramount need is to standardize economic legislation. 
We have already spoken of the need for a single emission 
center. The exchange rate for Belarusian rubles and Russian 
rubles is a very acute problem. 
  It is obvious that a rate of one to one, given exchange 
quotations of at least three to one, will cause a sharp surge in 
inflation -- which will lead ultimately to negative consequences 
not only for Russia but also for Belarus itself. We should seek 
a mutually acceptable solution to the exchange rate -- a 
solution based on realistic assessments of the real value of 
Belarusian money. In this sense the exchange rate can serve 
only as a guideline. It does not reflect the actual correlation. 
  As regards supplying Belarus with cash in hand, this can be 
done on a security. Only it should be remembered here that its 
terms must be acceptable to Belarus. 
  If these requirements are fulfilled, the two countries' 
closer economic integration can even now ensure for Russia a 
definite economic gain. Since foreign economic ties are being 
activated, the problems of transactions and payments, which are 
currently exerting a highly adverse impact on our economy, will 
be simplified.

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said that 
"new government appointments will in no way jeopardize Russia's 
commitments to foreign partners. This country will observe the 
conditions and deadlines for payments of foreign debt that were 
agreed upon with the IMF, the World Bank, and other western 
financial organizations." 
  In an exclusive interview he gave Interfax Friday [21 
January] he said that "this was also true of our commitments to 
foreign countries. Our partners have nothing to worry about. 
The policy of Russia remains unchanged and will not be 
dependent on individual cabinet members. President Yeltsin is 
the guarantor of this." 
  He thought that the plunge of the ruble against the dollar 
in 
the currency exchange had nothing to do with the actual economic 
situation in the country or government activities. 
  The noticeable decline of the dollar in the currency 
exchange 
Thursday suggested, he thinks, that the anxiety caused by 
changes in the Russian government was subsiding. In his view, 
"the activities of banks in the currency market confirm that the 
panic was man-made, especially by not very responsible remarks 
of certain civil servants." 
  Answering an Interfax question, Chernomyrdin emphasized that 
his negotiations with the president on changes in the government 
"were not always easy," but that both men wanted to set up an 
"able team of leaders intent on rejuvenating the country through 
reforms." 
  "Some observers make a mistake saying that Chernomyrdin has 
formed a government of 'tacit agreement.' I hope that the 
country will see that this is not so in the first months of this 
year," the premier said. He thought that the public tended to 
exaggerate "the role played by personalities" in the reform. 
  "Everybody can see now that the country is firmly on the 
reform course. What we want above all is to carry these reforms 
out with the least amount of damage to society, the individual, 
the family. I do not think that replacement of a minister is a 
tragedy. I believe this is a natural process. If we had not 
been confident of our ability to halt production decline, we 
would not have started this job. There is no shortage of 
critics. It is people who are prepared to do the hard work that 
are in short supply. We are willing to do it," Chernomyrdin 
said. 
  The exclusive interview is published in the January 21 
edition of Interfax's Presidential Bulletin.

  [Text] Government changes will not affect the honoring of 
Russia's commitments to foreign partners in any way, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin has told Interfax. We will continue to adhere to 
all deadlines and conditions for the repayment of our foreign 
debt, which were agreed with the IMF, the World Bank, and other 
financial organizations, he stressed. Russia's policies toward 
individual foreign countries will also remain unchanged. The 
president is the guarantee of this, Chernomyrdin noted. The 
prime minister does not feel that renewal in the country depends 
all that greatly on the role of individual personalities. 
Cabinet changes are a natural process. Russia cannot be 
deflected from the path of reform. But the main task is to 
carry out these reforms with the least possible harm to each 
member of society, the head of the Russian Government believes.

Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] DIPLOMATS OF GERMANY... 
  Germany does not share the opinion stating that the new 
composition of the Russian Government means "an end to reform 
policy," press secretary of the German Embassy to Moscow Enno 
Barker declared in his interview with INTERFAX Friday. 
  "We do not think that reforms in Russia are in danger due to 
the fact that their supporters have left the government," he 
said. 
  According to the diplomat, Germany "counts on the tandem 
Yeltsin- Chernomyrdin which embodies the Russian reformatory 
course." "It is up to them to decide on which key figures in the 
government to rely upon. It would be a short-sighted approach 
to think that the process of reformation of the Russian 
political and economic system would stop after Gaydar's 
resignation," he said. 
  Barker expressed the opinion that "the Russian political 
elite still maintains its principal consent regarding 
continuation of the reforms, which means that they will not be 
overthrown." 
  He was remindful that Germany maintains the closest economic 
ties with Russia compared with all other western countries, and 
that is why it is greatly concerned over the situation in the 
Russian economy. The diplomat expressed hope that both 
countries would continue their cooperation. 
  He also pointed out that despite different messages, Germany 
"is convinced that Russia has not concluded the real process of 
the new Russian government's formation." 
<H5>  OF JAPAN... </H5>
  The reshuffle in the Russian Government should not affect 
Japanese-Russian relations, said a senior official at the 
Japanese Embassy in Moscow, who asked not to be identified. 
  He told INTERFAX on Friday that Japan wished to "expand" its 
relations with Russia "in a balanced way" on the basis of 
agreements reached during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Tokyo. "This means that a solution to the territorial problem in 
Japanese-Russian relations (the Kuril Islands issue) should be 
based on historical facts and the principles of law and 
justice," he said. 
  The official said that, with Yegor Gaidar's resignation and 
the reorganization of the government, "extremely close 
attention should be paid to the conduct and composition of the 
secretariat of the Russian president." "The importance of that 
body is growing extremely fast under the present circumstances. 
One has the impression that the secretariat of the Russian 
president is beginning to fulfill the functions of departments 
in the former Central Committee of the Communist Party, that is 
it stands above the government," the official said. 
<H5>  AND GREAT BRITAIN. </H5>
  Britain will support Russian President Boris Yeltsin as long 
as he remains loyal to his policy of reform, said a senior 
official at the British Embassy in Moscow. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, the official, who asked not 
to 
be named, said it was an alarming fact that the reformists have 
left the government. 
  "The reforms may slow down and inflation may increase," he 
said. 
  But the changes in the government might have positive 
effects, too, the diplomat said. "The Russian Government has up 
until now been heterogeneous. Maybe now that it consists of 
people having the same views, its policy will be more 
effective," he said.

Russia's economic zone and a disputed area in the Sea of Okhotsk 
exploited by foreign boats have sealed off the area in the north 
and northeast. 
  Leader of the Russian Fish Workers' Trade Union Viktor 
Zeryanov told Interfax the Trade Union considered inadmissible 
the government delay on the issue of stopping fishery in this 
area and demanded urgent measures to enforce its protection. 
  Russian experts fear uncontrolled fishery by foreign boats 
may considerably reduce fish reserves in the Sea of Okhotsk and 
ruin its ecosystem which is [word indistinct] with serious 
socioeconomic aftermath for the indigenous population and 
fishers of the Far East.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Bazhenov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jan -- ITAR-TASS has learned that the 
Russian Foreign Ministry today made a representation to the 
Japanese Embassy in Russia in connection with mass violations by 
Japanese fishing boats on the border of Russia's territorial 
waters in the area of Kunashir island [one of the Kurils], which 
took place on 21, 22 January. 
  Nikolay Solovyev, director of the second Asian department of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry said in an interview with ITAR-TASS 
that last Friday [21 January]: More than 50 Japanese schooners 
made a show of entering Russian territorial waters and, in spite 
of a request by Russian border guards to leave, remained there 
for more than five hours. On 22 January, 30 Japanese schooners 
again entered Russia's territorial waters and remained there for 
more than five hours. 
  It is quite remarkable that three vessels of the Japanese 
security directorate were not far from this area, but, 
unfortunately, they did not prevent, in any way, the Japanese 
schooners from violating Russian territorial waters. 
  At the same time, Solovyev noted that the behavior of the 
crew of the Japanese schooners toward Russian border guards was 
impertinent. 
  The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
said: Such unprecedented violations of Russian territorial 
waters by Japanese fishing vessels may have a negative effect on 
the development of relations between the countries. 
  Solovyev stressed that the Russian Foreign Ministry: Cannot 
avoid expressing its serious concern in connection with this 
matter, taking into consideration the fact that these violations 
are taking place on the eve of bilateral consultations being 
held at the level of deputy foreign ministers, as well as on the 
eve of a sitting of the working group on the treaty on peace.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 22 KYODO -- Russia alleges a number of 
Japanese fishing boats entered and stayed in Russian territorial 
waters Friday [21 January] and Saturday near Kunashiri Island, 
one of the Russian-held islands claimed by Japan, Japanese 
embassy officials said. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry filed a protest with the 
embassy, the officials said. 
  The Japanese embassy said it does not know what happened 
near 
Kunashiri. 
  ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported more than 50 Japanese vessels 
violated territorial waters on Friday and some 30 others on 
Saturday. 
  Russian border guards demanded that the Japanese leave but 
the boats stayed for more than five hours, ITAR-TASS said, 
quoting Nikolay Solovyev, head of the ministry's Asia-Pacific 
Affairs Bureau. 
  Three Japanese patrol boats were there but did not take any 
action, ITAR-TASS said. 
  Japan has long called for the return of the Russian-occupied 
islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group of 
islets -- which the former Soviet Union seized immediately after 
World War II.

  [Text] Tokyo January 23 TASS -- Japan intends to stop 
giving humanitarian aid to Russia and to monitor the 
effectiveness of other programmes for assistance to Moscow, 
according to a Japanese Government decision to revise the policy 
of assistance to Russia, a number of central Japanese newspapers 
reported on Sunday referring to sources in the country's Foreign 
Ministry. 
  According to the sources, Tokyo has arrived at a conclusion 
about the need to give up implementing the earlier announced 
humanitarian aid programmes, worth a total of 500 million U.S. 
dollars, considering the internal political situation in Russia. 
  Tokyo believes that the implementation of humanitarian aid 
programmes now may only be detrimental to the administration of 
President Boris Yeltsin, because, in the light of mounting 
nationalist and great-power sentiments in Russia, the Russian 
Government has been increasingly criticised for accepting 
foreign humanitarian aid. 
  Still, Tokyo intends to carry out all the other programmes 
for assistance to Russia in keeping with its commitments but 
will also monitor the effectiveness of their realisation. 
  Japanese Foreign Ministry sources emphasise that it is 
planned to attach paramount importance, first of all, to those 
programmes which actually promote radical economic reforms and 
help moscow take measures necessary to build a market economy. 
  Tokyo came to a conclusion about the need for such an 
approach in view of the formation of a new Russian Government 
which plans to introduce changes to the previously pursued 
economic policy, and with due regard for the results of the 
December elections to Russia's new parliament. 
  The Japanese Government intends to call on other western 
countries to reconsider their programme for assistance to Moscow 
so that they would stimulate Russia's headway along the road of 
reforms to a greater extent.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 24 Jan -- Today a representative of the 
Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry called the reports that 
appeared in the press about Tokyo deciding to stop humanitarian 
aid to Russia "a lie." On Sunday a number of Japanese 
newspapers, citing anonymous sources in the country's Foreign 
Affairs Ministry, informed that such a step was seemingly 
connected with the fact that the Russian population was having 
an increasingly negative attitude to "sops from abroad." 
  In a talk with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, a representative 
of the department on questions of aid to new independent states 
of the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry stated that such 
reports in no way corresponded to the facts. According to him, 
no changes had been made in the programs of aid to Russia, and 
they were all being consistently carried out at working level. 
This is also true in full for humanitarian aid to the former 
USSR, for which Tokyo has alloted $100,000,000, mainly to 
provide medicines. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry representative called the 
recently announced auction for Japanese companies to gain the 
right to supply consumer goods to Russia within the framework of 
the humanitarian aid program evidence of Japan's consecutive 
efforts in this direction.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
2300 GMT on 23 January carries a commentary by Viktor Levin on a 
report that the Japanese Government, in a reply to the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, has stated it cannot recognize the legitimacy 
of calling Japanese fishermen violators of Russian state borders. 
  Levin recalls the facts that provoked the Russian Foreign 
Ministry: the intrusion by Japanese fishing vessels into Russian 
territorial waters in the area of the South Kurils. 
  Levin says: "The Japanese authorities are effectively trying 
to justify the actions of the fishermen and are even trying to 
place a juridical foundation under this, making out that there 
was no violation of the borders." 
  He says Japan is hinting heavily that it does not recognize 
the South Kurils as Russian territory. "But this, in my view, 
is more than laying claim to the islands," Levin says. "This is 
pressure. And the actions ensuing from it look simply 
provocative." 
  Levin continues: "To talk about who the disputed islands 
belong to is one thing, but to try without prior arrangement to 
affirm their position in any shape on the spot, so to speak, is 
something quite different. 
  "In such an event Russia's reply can be one thing: resolute 
thwarting of border violations by every means. Russia is not a 
state with whom one can speak in the language of ultimatums and 
provocative actions. In my view, Japan, in taking the aforesaid 
position, is committing a crude political error. 
  "The question of who the disputed islands belong to is by no 
means unambiguous. The islands form part of Russia, and Russia 
is not only within its rights but also obliged to use all means 
to prevent intrusion into its territorial waters. Any testing 
of Russian borders for strength will bring forth the appropriate 
reaction." 
  Levin concludes, saying: "Tokyo says it wants to develop 
normal relations and discuss thorny questions at the negotiating 
table. But its actions cast a cloud over these relations and at 
the very least do not help the success of the talks."

  [Text] Tokyo January 23 TASS -- During the forthcoming 
Russian-Japanese talks between representatives of the command of 
the armed forces of the two countries, to be held here at the 
beginning of February, the Japanese side intends to demand 
complete withdrawal of Russian troops from South Kurils, which 
Tokyo lays claim to. A final decision to hold such talks was 
taken by the Japanese government on Saturday, the newspaper 
SEKAI NIPPO reported on Sunday. 
  Representatives of the command of the Russian Armed Forces 
are to arrive in Tokyo to attend a two-day seminar for the 
military and experts from Russia, the United States, and Japan 
on security in the northern Pacific. The seminar opens on 
February 1. Immediately after the seminar, the two sides will 
hold talks. 
  The Russian side intends to suggest setting about taking 
measures to build confidence between the two countries in the 
military field. In particular, Moscow will suggest implementing 
a programme for exchanges of servicemen and mutual friendship 
visits of the navy ships of the two countries. 
  The Japanese military, according to the newspaper, are 
planning to urge Moscow to demilitarise the South Kurils as soon 
as possible and provide Tokyo with full information concerning 
the potential of the armed forces and defence construction in 
Russia's Far East.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Gilovnin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo January 24 TASS -- In response to a request 
made by the Russian Foreign Ministry the Japanese authorities 
have began an investigation into an incident which occurred on 
January 21-22 when several dozens Japanese trawlers crossed into 
Russian territorial waters near the south Kuril island of 
Kunashir and remained there for a long time despite repeated 
warnings from the Russian side. 
  Director of the 2nd Russian Foreign Ministry department, 
Nikolay Solovyov, told ITAR-TASS that on January 21, over 50 
Japanese vessels entered Russian territorial waters near the 
island and remained there for over five hours despite warnings 
made by Russian border guards demanding that Japanese vessels 
leave the area. 
  On January 22, the incident was repeated with 30 Japanese 
vessels crossing into Russian territorial waters and 
subsequently staying there for five hours. According to 
Solovyov, three vessels belonging to the Japanese Department for 
Safety at Sea were close to the area where the incident occurred 
but made no attempt to prevent Japanese vessels from violating 
the border. The high-ranking Russian diplomat particularly 
noted arrogant conduct of Japanese crews towards Russian border 
guards. 
  The Department for Safety at Sea and the Japanese Foreign 
Ministries are investigating the circumstances under which the 
incident occurred. At present, fishermen who were directly 
involved in the incident near Kunashir, are being questioned, 
sources from both departments told ITAR-TASS. 
  According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, to begin with, 
Tokyo has to make sure that the incident really took place and 
find out whether Russian border guards fired warning shots. The 
investigation has been deliberately slow and there are many 
grounds to suppose that the Japanese side would like to hush up 
the incident. This is evident from the position assumed by the 
Department for Safety at Sea on the island of Hokkaido adjoining 
to the Kuril islands which, in response to an inquiry made by 
ITAR- TASS, denied the very fact of the incident near Kunashir. 
  Tokyo regards the south Kuril islands to be its "northern 
territories" which were illegally occupied by Moscow in 1945. 
Stemming from this position, Tokyo does not recognise the 
Russian state border in this area and rejects accusations of 
violating it. 
  Last year, Japanese fishermen illegally entered Russian 
territorial waters in the area of Kuril islands over 5,000 
times. However, the scale and arrogance of the recent violation 
made the incident conspicuous in an endless chain of similar 
incidents which occurred before.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 24 Jan -- The Japanese Government expects to 
conclude by March this year outline agreements with three 
republics of the former Soviet Union, excluding Russia, on 
assistance in scrapping the nuclear weapons they have inherited 
after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned this today at the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry. 
  In the words of a member of the disarmament section at the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry, diplomats from Tokyo are conducting 
talks in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to decide what share 
each of the three republic is to receive of the $100 million 
Japan allocated to the CIS in April 1993 to facilitate the 
scrapping of nuclear weapons and the utilization of radioactive 
waste. 
  The Japanese assistance is to be directed toward 
facilitating 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections at 
military and civilian nuclear facilities in these countries, and 
toward ensuring the safe storage of fissile materials. Specific 
programs will also envisage sending to the spot Japanese 
specialists from nuclear power stations and nuclear waste 
depositories, as well as teaching Japanese experience to local 
staff. 
  Tokyo has decided to expedite the process of drafting 
outline 
agreements in view of the fact that Ukraine and Kazakhstan have 
recently adopted a constructive stand concerning accession to 
the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty, and that Kiev has 
guaranteed the withdrawal of this type of weapons from its 
territory.

  [Text] Liquid radioactive wastes (LRW) will not be dumped 
in the Sea of Japan for a month or two, Admiral Feliks Gromov, 
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy said in answering an 
INTERFAX question at a news conference in Vladivostok Friday. 
He explained that other ways of safe storage were under study. 
  The admiral did not know if the tanker that the Japanese had 
offered would do for the purpose. The ship must have a double 
bottom, a double hull made of good steel, a good system for LRW 
pumping in and out and equipment for turning liquid wastes into 
solids. 
  This is a matter for the state to handle, the Navy 
Commander-in- Chief said. The problem had become so acute, he 
explained, because every agency used to set up its own system 
for disposal of dangerous wastes; as a result no system for 
their permanent storage was available. This matter is now being 
dealt with by the Russian Atomic Industry Ministry. 
  Gromov said that these events (dumping the wastes in the sea 
- IF) should not be dramatized. He said that there were no 
traces of radioactive wastes as early as after 20 hours, their 
concentration was so low and the Sea of Japan so pure. 
  Gromov did not confirm that Russia had sold a submarine to 
North Korea. "If the navy sold anything to it, it was scrap 
metal," he said. 
  He wanted Russia to keep the disputed Kuril Isles. "Russians 
have been living there for a long time and Russia needs the 
fish, land and deposits there." 
  The Navy Commander-in-Chief emphasized that, despite its 
reduction and financial shortages, the Pacific Fleet was capable 
of maintaining stability and safe shipping from the Chukotsk 
Peninsula to the south of the Maritime Territory. 
  "The fleet will continue renovation albeit at a slower rate 
in line with the new military doctrine," the admiral said. 
  He emphasized that Russia would not build aircraft carrying 
ships for the Pacific Fleet and was surprised that the Japanese 
were building one. 
  Speaking on navy reform in line with the new doctrine the 
admiral said that the emphasis was placed on confidence 
building, peace keeping missions and partnership with NATO and 
other coalitions, in particular in the Pacific area.

  [Text] Moscow January 22 TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry has denied allegations that Russia has offered to pay 
its debts to South Korea by selling or launching joint 
production of modern arms. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS, Nikolay Solovyov, 
head of the Second Department for Asia of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, on Saturday, said that "the Russian Foreign Ministry 
did not hand over to the Embassy of South Korea on January 19 
any official documents concerning the selling or joint 
production of missiles, submarines or other modern technologies 
as a form of debt payment for credits." 
  The statement followed a publication by the South Korean 
newspaper HANGUK ILBO which quoted sources in the South Korean 
Foreign Ministry as saying that Russia had officially offered to 
pay its debts for Korean credits either by selling its arms or 
launching their joint production. The newspaper also claimed 
that on January 19 the South Korean Embassy in Moscow had been 
presented with a list of military technologies offered by Russia 
for selling or joint production. It said the list had to be 
considered by the Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs and 
Defence. 
  The newspaper said that during his visit to Seoul in August 
1993 Aleksandr Shokhin, who was a Russian vice-prime minister at 
that time, handed over to South Korea a package of proposals on 
military and technical cooperation. Solovyov confirmed this 
information, but added that South Korea has not made an official 
reply yet.

Asia-Pacific Region. Asia Can Make up for Russia's Losses in 
the West. Aleksandr Panov Ready To Give Helping Hand to Russian 
Businessmen for Asian Market"] 
  [Text] Russian politicians of the highest rank have 
repeatedly underlined that broader cooperation with the 
countries of Asia could plug some of the gaps in Russia's 
relations with the West. This equally applies to trade and 
economic relations, as well as political ones. Their 
invigoration will be discussed in the course of a tour of the 
countries of Central Asia, the Russian Far East, and China by 
Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is 
setting off on this trip on 24 January. Aleksandr Panov, who 
has recently changed his job from ambassador to Seoul to that of 
deputy minister of foreign affairs, kindly agreed to comment on 
the state of Russia's relations in the Asia-Pacific Region in an 
interview with your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. 
<H5>  Russia Faces Asia </H5>
  In Mr. Panov's opinion, Russia has till this moment been 
paying its main attention to broader relations with the West. 
This can partially be explained by the fact that the more 
economically developed part of the Russian territory is in 
Europe. However, the diplomat believes, relations with Asia are 
extremely promising only if because of the current rapid 
economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Of no minor 
importance is also the fact that Asian countries are not 
refusing to buy finished products from Russia. Mr. Panov thinks 
that Moscow has been able to do much in recent years to expand 
trade and economic relations with the Asia-Pacific region: far 
from falling, the volume of trade has grown. Russia's political 
ties with countries in the region are also picking up: Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to Japan took place after all, and he also went 
to South Korea, India, and China. This years opens with a visit 
to the PRC by Andrey Kozyrev. In Moscow, they are awaiting 
South Korea President Kim Yong-sam, and the head of Japan's 
cabinet, Morahiro Hosokawa. 
<H5>  Foreign Ministry Offers its Services to Russian Businessmen </H5>
  Mr. Panov believes that a stronger Russian position in the 
Asia- Pacific Region will be helped by its participation in 
regional organizations. Russia already today takes part in two 
of them: the Pacific Economic Council, which brings together 
private businesses; and the Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Council. Membership in these structures helps Russian 
entrepreneurs keep abreast of all important events in the 
region. According to the diplomat, entrepreneurs of the Russian 
Far East began to trade independently on Asia's markets in 
recent years. Today they account for nearly 50 percent 
($600-700 million) of Russia's trade with South Korea. The 
business contacts, however, are not always successful owing to 
unfamiliarity with the region. Mr. Panov therefore advises that 
Russian businessmen increasingly seek assistance from Russian 
embassies and trade missions which, in his words, are ready to 
help them find partners. 
  Mr. Panov thinks that membership in regional structures 
would 
help Russia avoid competition with countries like the United 
States and Japan that traditionally wield strong influence in 
the region and are naturally reluctant to yield ground to 
Moscow. The diplomat noted with regret, however, that real 
competition is a long way off because U.S. trade with 
Asia-Pacific countries is around $300 billion, while Russia's 
trade with the Asia-Pacific region has never exceeded $10-15 
billion. As for boosting these figures through arms exports, 
one should not expect contracts worth billions in the near 
future. Russia, he believes, lacks sufficient experience in 
this business. Besides, Asian markets, arms markets in 
particular, are traditionally geared to supplies from the United 
States, France, and Great Britain. 
<H5>  To Draw Borders With China Is Easier Than With Japan </H5>
  Mr. Panov thinks that, for the first time in decades, 
relations between Russia and China are simply normal: "In the 
past, we either fraternized or argued." Problems do exist, of 
course, but they are solvable. One is territorial. There is a 
widely held opinion that Russia is handing over its territories 
to the PRC unilaterally. What really is happening, according to 
him, is that Beijing also makes concessions. The diplomat also 
terms as promising Russia's recent proposal on the joint 
economic use of these border territories. The other problem is 
the transparency of the Russian- Chinese border. There too, the 
Russian Foreign Ministry is taking measures to limit no-visa 
entry by the Chinese. 
  As for Japan, in the wake of Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Tokyo, the sides have in full measure come to realize the entire 
complexity of the territorial problem. Mr. Panov believes that 
one should not expect an appreciable progress in its solution in 
the near future. According to him, Russia and Japan will start 
a new round of talks in February, but a complete settlement of 
this question should be preceded by the process of rapprochement 
in the sides' positions on the entire set of both political and 
economic problems.

  [Text] The conflict between "Gazprom" and its German 
partner "Wintershall" on the one hand and the "Verbundnetz Gaz" 
joint-stock company on the other, which IZVESTIYA reported in 
its previous issue, has by all accounts been settled. 
  INTERFAX has reported that "Wintershall" and "Verbundnetz 
Gaz" reported Thursday [20 January] that they had managed to 
reach a last-minute compromise on the price of Russian gas and 
thereby avert the termination of deliveries of it to the FRG's 
eastern Laender. It was announced that this month the sides 
will sign a long-term contract for gas deliveries from Russia.

  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party, Agrarian Party and 
Communist Party groups in the lower house of the Russian 
parliament made public Friday [21 January] their draft statement 
on the situation in former Yugoslavia. 
  The State Duma would denounce the use of any kind of force, 
in particular imposition of no-fly zones, against former 
Yugoslav republics. 
  The draft also calls for withdrawal of all foreign military 
contingents from former Yugoslavia and for appropriate steps to 
be taken by the Russian authorities. 
  At their Wednesday meeting the Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin and 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had agreed that the ministry [as 
received] or his deputy Vitaliy Churkin would attend the 
discussion on former Yugoslavia during the regular Friday 
"government hour."

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] The Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Foreign 
Affairs, Vladimir Lukin, has addressed to the Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev a formal request for the package of international 
treaties and other acts, subject to parliamentary ratification. 
  He told INTERFAX on Friday [21 January] that he had asked 
the 
minister to set priorities on the documents' review. 
  In line with the federal Constitution, the Duma endorses the 
appointment and the calling of Russia's ambassadors. For this 
reason, Lukin also asked Kozyrev to spell out his suggestions on 
this score, too. 
  Russia's ambassador to the U.S. before his election to the 
Duma, Lukin explained that formally he was still ambassador, 
even though he had sent a letter of resignation to President 
Yeltsin. 
  He reported that his committee had held its first session on 
Thursday. "We know what to do, but we don't know where to do it 
since up until now we've had no premises to house the 
committee," Lukin said. 
  He said that he had initiated parliamentary debates on the 
situation in the former Yugoslavia and had drafted an 
appropriate statement. 
  An alternative draft on the Yugoslav crisis, according to 
Lukin, had been prepared by three factions -- the Communists, 
Agrarians, and Liberal-Democrats. 
  Lukin voiced "grave concern" over NATO's persistent 
discussions on the possibility of hitting targets in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The document notes that force will hardly end the war there 
but will only aggravate the conflict. 
  In Lukin's opinion, the Duma should urge the president and 
government "to spare no effort to avoid the escalation of 
fighting in the former Yugoslavia." 
  In the alternative draft, the Communists, Agrarians, and 
Liberal- Democrats describe as "inadmissible any coercive 
measure against the former Yugoslav republics, including the 
establishment of no-fly zones." 
  The Russian side is requested to adopt "appropriate 
measures" 
within the framework of the UN Security Council "for getting 
these recommendations implemented."

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jan -- What is important now is to focus 
attention on the main thing, namely to complete the process of a 
political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Otherwise the world 
will continue watching the tragedy unfold, said Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. 
  In an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
upon his return earlier tonight from Geneva, where another round 
of talks between the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict was 
held, Churkin said that with every unsuccessful round it is 
becoming more difficult to hope for success at the talks on a 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It was at the previous round of talks in Brussels last 
December that another opportunity to achieve accord was missed, 
Vitaliy Churkin added. At that moment the international 
community lacks determination to bring the matter to a logical 
end, and now it is lacking even more. 
  Vitaliy Churkin said the next round is scheduled to take 
place in Geneva on 10 February. That meeting will aim to 
achieve more modest tasks, and it will be attended by fewer 
participants. Representatives of the sides will gather only to 
discuss confidence measures, so it will be a meeting with 
limited goals.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 Jan -- What is important now is to focus 
attention on bringing to completion the process of political 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Otherwise the world will 
continue watching the tragedy unfold, said Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. 
  In his exclusive interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
upon 
his return from Geneva on Saturday evening, where another round 
of talks between the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict had 
taken place, Churkin said that with every unsuccessful round it 
was becoming more difficult to hope for success of the talks on 
the Bosnia settlement. 
  Churkin said that the last round was unsuccessful. He noted 
that it was at the previous round of talks in Brussels last 
December that another opportunity to achieve accord was missed. 
At that moment the international community lacked determination 
to bring the matter to a logical end, and now it is lacking even 
more. The deputy foreign minister believes that in essence, the 
participants of the talks are now going round in circles, that 
is to say that this time they did not touch upon the problems 
that appeared to be the main and final problems at the last 
round of talks. They discussed some other, completely different 
questions. For instance, if last time it seemed that the 
questions on the Muslim republic's access to the sea and the 
Sava river, that is to say, the questions connected with its 
life support system, were the first and most important obstacles 
for achieving the final settlement this time, these questions 
were not mentioned at all. New problems have appeared and one 
could have the impression that the previous fifth and sixth 
rounds of negotiations did not exist at all. Churkin said that 
this situation confirms the anxiety of the Russian side that if 
the clear position is not taken and if the sides are not 
encouraged to sign the agreement, disputes about the various 
aspects of this agreement may continue indefinitely. 
  What worries me most of all, said Churkin, is that it looks 
like the world community, to say nothing of the participants of 
the talks, has lost its bearings, and that a certain confusion, 
bordering on panic, has emerged in respect of the idea that 
nothing can be achieved, and important but secondary issues are 
being brought to the forefront. He underlined that: It is my 
deep belief that without a political settlement the humanitarian 
issue, no matter how hard it is pursued, will continue to find 
itself in a tragic state because while the war continues -- when 
each side goes on thinking about a military victory -- it will 
not be possible to satisfy the humanitarian requirements of the 
population. At present, one has the situation, the deputy 
minister continued, where the political side of the matter has 
been somewhat forgotten and very important though still 
secondary humanitarian issues including even individual episodes 
of the general humanitarian situation are being brought to the 
forefront. 
  Churkin said the Serb side, the Bosnian Serbs, had assured 
him, in particular, that there will be no problem with relieving 
the Canadian battalion by a Dutch unit in Srebrenica. He was 
also assured (by Dr. Karadzic and President Milosevic) that when 
the plan for monitoring the airport in Tuzla to ensure its 
non-military use is drawn up, the Serb side will consider it. 
This is a fundamentally different position, Churkin said. If, 
in the past the Serbs would simply refuse to consider the issue, 
this time they agreed. There are three landing strips in Tuzla 
and a comprehensive monitoring plan should be drawn up in order 
to fully guarantee that none of the strips is used for 
delivering military cargoes. In brief, he said, all these 
issues could be resolved but, if there is no political 
settlement, the world will watch a continuing tragedy in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  As far as the question of air strikes in Bosnia are 
concerned, Churkin pointed to the corresponding UNSC [UN 
Security Council] resolutions that refer to the possibility of 
such actions within the framework of assistance to the UN 
peace-keeping forces in Bosnia- Herzegovina and assistance to 
the humanitarian measures of the world community. 
  Speaking about the position of the Russian side on this 
question, it cannot be said that Russia is a priori, opposed to 
any air strikes, he went on. If a situation suddenly arises 
where the UN troops indeed become the target of a direct attack 
by any of the conflicting sides, Churkin said, explaining his 
personal view, then I would recommend (and I am sure that a 
political solution will be adopted) that this measure be 
supported. Or take another instance: a malicious act might be 
carried out and one of the sides refuses to allow humanitarian 
aid to reach the dying. In these cases, he stressed, the 
toughest measures may well be taken. 
  But when there is talk of inflicting air strikes virtually 
straight away in order to help the operation to replace the 
battalions (the replacement is actually scheduled for 
mid-February, there is an accord on enabling this replacement in 
Srebrenica), then in Churkin's opinion, such proposals are aimed 
at diverting attention from the real problems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is hard to imagine, he went on, how air 
strikes would help to open the airport in Tuzla or serve to 
carry out the replacement of the Canadian battalion with a Dutch 
one. It is entirely clear that if air strikes are inflicted in 
the Srebrenica area, there will be no replacement -- combat 
activity will continue and any sort of humanitarian aid will be 
absolutely out of the question. 
  As for the dissatisfaction with Lord Owen's activities over 
a Bosnian settlement that certain circles and people have been 
voicing recently, Churkin believes that the replacement or 
resignation of one of the co-chairmen of the London 
international conference on a settlement in former Yugoslavia 
would now be a serious mistake. Lord Owen, Churkin said, is the 
only person who has been dealing with the issues regarding the 
settlement from the very start: He has concentrated all the 
threads of the negotiations in his hands and if he were now to 
be replaced, then: Those from any of the three sides in Bosnia 
who do not want an accord could simply take advantage of this 
circumstance in order to continue to deceive everyone, raise 
more and more fresh issues, or return to old ones and so on and 
so forth. 
  Churkin recalled that Lord Owen at one time adopted a very 
tough stance -- an anti-Serbian one -- calling for air strikes 
against individual targets, and: Now, when this is no longer 
the case, we start hearing calls for Lord Owen to be replaced. 
The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister believes that it is now 
very difficult to find a worthy replacement for Lord Owen, and 
without losing the tempo of the talks process, simply 
impossible. This would, in effect, mean, he said, that the 
world community would be resigning itself to its own 
powerlessness and it would then be a question of a completely 
new long round of political efforts with obscure prospects for 
success. 
  The next round, Churkin said in conclusion, has been 
arranged 
for 10 February in Geneva. That meeting has been set more 
modest tasks, and it will be attended by fewer participants. 
Representatives of the Bosnian sides [as received] will gather 
to discuss confidence measures, so it will be a meeting with 
limited goals.

  [Text] Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk says "those who 
offer Ukraine to hold back to its nuclear arsenal want the 
country to become hostage to the nuclear weapons signing a death 
warrant to the people of Ukraine". He was speaking in Kiev on 
Friday [21 January] while attending the national stock exchange. 
  Kravchuk said that by signing the three-nation nuclear 
disarmament agreement in Moscow, "we have met the conditions set 
by the Ukrainian parliament during the ratification of the 
Start-1 agreement." He said the government embarked on the road 
of implementing rather than blocking parliamentary resolutions 
and had to strike compromise and make concessions as it should 
be.

  [Text] Kiev January 24 TASS -- Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy, 
Ukrainian ambassador to Russia, has described the tripartite 
Moscow agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament as a great 
breakthrough not only for Ukranian, but also for Russian 
diplomacy. He took part in the Perekryostok programme, 
broadcast by Ukrainian TV on Sunday, which highlighted the 
forthcoming discussion of the agreement by the Ukrainian 
parliament, due to take place on January 25. 
  The Ukrainian ambassador stressed that Russia had approached 
the tripartite Moscow agreement realistically, acting as an 
equal and not senior partner during the settlement of the 
complicated problem. Kryzhanovskiy said that he supported the 
tripartite Moscow agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament 
both as a diplomat and a Ukrainian citizen. "Nuclear weapons 
are not what our people need today. The problem for them is 
survival. If nuclear disarmament even involves compensation, 
the Ukrainian parliament should support the Moscow agreement," 
he said. 
  The same idea was expressed by Ukrainian Deputy Defence 
Minister Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, who also took part in the 
Perekryostok programme. He stressed that President Kravchuk had 
acted in Moscow on the basis of the resolution of the Ukrainian 
parliament in the part, dealing with the ratification of the 
START-1 Treaty. He pointed out that the participation of the 
United States in the Moscow treaty is a positive factor and a 
guarantee, and called attention to the importance for Ukraine of 
the fact that Russia agreed to provide maintenance to the 
nuclear warheads, deployed in Ukraine.

  [Text] The trilateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the elimination of 
nuclear weapons on the territory of our state remains the focus 
of attention. If, in the world as a whole this move is 
supported on a mass scale, in Ukraine attitudes toward this 
statement and its assessments are ambiguous. Our correspondent 
Petro Ostapenko met Oleksandr Tarasenko, the deputy chairman of 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine's Commission for Issues of 
Defense and State Security, and asked him to express his 
attitude toward the trilateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. 
  [Begin recording] [Ostapenko] Ukraine's President Leonid 
Kravchuk and representatives of the executive bodies of power 
are saying today that the trilateral statement is the result and 
continuation, let us say, of the decisions by the Supreme 
Council on nuclear weapons. Oleksandr, what is your opinion? 
Is this true? 
  [Tarasenko] Well, this document still needs in-depth 
comprehension. First, it is called a statement, a trilateral 
statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and 
Russia. How should we assess it today? Does it have a legal 
force as an international document and as an agreement, or is 
this just a statement? Upon studying it profoundly -- yesterday 
our commission was considering this document -- upon studying it 
profoundly, it can, in the long run, be qualified as an 
international agreement. In compliance with our current 
legislation -- the Constitution first and foremost -- and in 
compliance with the law on the president, on his plenary powers, 
the international agreements that Ukraine -- that is, the 
executive power, concludes in the field of defense, military 
construction, military relations with neighboring and other 
states, are subject to mandatory ratification by the Supreme 
Council. 
  Why did I say that this document is an agreement and not a 
statement? Because, there is a supplement to the trilateral 
statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and 
Russia as of 14 January, and this supplement provides specific 
dates, the terms on which our strategic nuclear weapons should 
be fully deactivated, their number, and so on. This goes beyond 
the limits of the resolution that was adopted by the Supreme 
Council. What does this supplement stipulate? This supplement 
gives, for example, such parameters: Ukraine ensures the 
elimination of all nuclear weapons, including strategic 
offensive weapons -- that is, strategic air force, TU-160, and 
other aircraft carrying nuclear missiles, located on its 
territory, in compliance with its relevant agreements within the 
term of seven years as is envisaged by the START I Treaty and 
within the context of the statement by the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine on Ukraine's non-nuclear status, all the RS-22 missiles 
-- to be more specific they are called SS-24 -- on Ukraine's 
territory will be deactivated within 10 months by means of 
removing their warheads. What does it mean? 
  You know that in two thirds of our silos launcher vehicles 
are filled with liquid fuel -- that is, heptyl. The entire 
world already knows what kind of a liquid fuel this is. This 
heptyl is a super poisonous substance, and the launcher vehicle 
itself is even a bigger powder keg than the launcher vehicle and 
the warhead as a whole. Proceeding from this, Ukraine and its 
plenary bodies and persons must take into account their own 
interests, first and foremost, and not the interests of those 
who benefit from this unilaterally. I believe that the Supreme 
Council, either the present or the future one, should seriously 
ponder over this document, and it can be ratified only after its 
parameters are specified. 
  [Ostapenko] I am sorry to interrupt you. You have just read 
the item that has to do with all sides without exception. But 
nothing is said here about the Supreme Council resolution on the 
ratification of START I with reservations. It clearly 
stipulates that 36 percent of launcher vehicles and 42 percent 
of warheads are subject to elimination today. That is to say, 
these parameters have been extended to all nuclear [word 
indistinct]. 
  [Tarasenko] Absolutely. They run contrary to the Supreme 
Council resolution. The Supreme Council resolution and START I 
envisage a percentage and here it talks about the complete 
elimination. 
  In this connection I would like to say the following, so 
that 
our radio listeners and our compatriots, our half-brothers, as 
they say, would know it: All those strategic nuclear systems 
located on the territory of Ukraine are targeted at certain 
objectives in the United States of America and relevant bases 
beyond the borders of the U.S. Correspondingly, approximately 
the same number of nuclear weapons are targeted at our 
territory. Well, this is military strategy and tactics, and 
there is nothing incomprehensible here. Everybody understands 
this: If you target me, then I target you. But this document 
should also envisage adequate moves on the part of the United 
States of America, and our control over this, because everyone 
will control us, control how we eliminate nuclear weapons, 
remove nuclear warheads, transfer them from Ukraine to Russia. 
The only thing envisaged here is that Ukraine will have the 
possibility of controlling Russia neutralizing the nuclear 
warheads. However, this agreement does not envisage what the 
United States will do with that quantity of strategic nuclear 
weapons that are targeted at us, and what will be Ukraine's role 
in carrying out control over this process, as far as the actions 
of the United States are concerned. 
  [Ostapenko] Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin declared that 
they would decode their missiles, which would then be 
retargetted at some deserted islands, or something like that. 
Ukraine's participation here is not envisaged, is that right? 
  [Tarasenko] Ukraine's participation here is not envisaged. 
Moreover, I disagree with such a stand, just as a citizen and 
just as an inhabitant of this planet Earth. If Ukraine 
eliminates these weapons, the former weapons of the Soviet 
Union, as is known, then the United States of America should 
eliminate and neutralize the same quantity of weapons. This is 
what we are talking about, not about retargetting at some other 
states, and so on. That is to say, there is no alternative in 
the world to universal nuclear disarmament and appropriate 
actions by all nuclear states. This is what our politicians 
should insist on, and at this point I again repeat and emphasize 
that the given document needs in-depth comprehension in legal 
terms, in terms of international law. What obligations, what 
guarantees can we talk about? Because, they already guaranteed 
us something to a certain extent. Let us not mention any names 
today, because there has already been enough talk about this. 
Who is to blame and who, let us say, ordered the transfer of 
tactical nuclear weapons from the territory of Ukraine? Those 
are our weapons. They would have been of paramount importance 
for the defense capacity of Ukraine. However, we transferred 
those weapons and could not cope with these ones. Here we 
outwitted ourselves. 
  [Ostapenko] I know, Oleksandr, that you are familiar with 
the 
technical condition of the strategic nuclear weapons, missiles, 
and warheads located on Ukraine's territory. Today, in numerous 
interviews, the military say that it is difficult for Ukraine to 
service them, that Ukraine will be unable to service them, 
therefore, the sooner we deactivate and transfer these weapons, 
the better for Ukraine. What do you think about it, please. 
  [Tarasenko] You, Petro, probably touched upon a very 
important aspect of this problem. It is quite clear that 
nuclear warheads and their systems are the most sophisticated 
systems because they should be sophisticated as they guarantee 
the safety of a nuclear warhead itself and a silo as a whole. 
This is why there exists a practice in the world according to 
which the given warheads are serviced by the authors who 
manufactured them. The authors themselves can destroy them. 
There is no other process, as they say. In this respect, we 
could find a state that would do this [word indistinct] but we 
cannot do this without Russia because the one who will have 
access there should know what it is, and so on. Therefore, every 
launching system and, moreover, nuclear warhead has relevant 
terms which guarantee their safety, and systems. We cannot do 
this without Russia. Therefore, it is necessary either to have 
very specific, responsible bilateral agreements toward that end 
with Russia on ensuring periodic servicing of the warheads and 
the silos as a whole or to neutralize and transfer them after 
their guaranteed service life expires. There is no other way 
around. Also, it could be possible to do as follows: A certain 
number of warheads and silos could be dismantled without their 
periodic servicing after their guaranteed service life expires. 
This is the way to follow. This would be the most correct, most 
appropriate way. Following it, one should move from the 
warhead, from the head, as they say, to the tail. That is to 
say, to dismantle the entire silo and not just remove the 
warheads and leave the rest with ourselves. It would be the 
same kind of a powder keg. Therefore, the most correct way is 
to act in line with a stage-by-stage, unit-by-unit principle. 
Both the warhead and the launcher vehicle should be dismantled 
completely. This would ensure the highest level of security to 
our state. 
  [Ostapenko] One more, very important aspect, as far as this 
problem is concerned. Did you see the guarantees of Ukraine's 
national security in this statement and in the supplement, the 
guarantees that Ukraine and the Supreme Council were striving 
for and which all those living in Ukraine wish to have. 
  [Tarasenko] Undoubtedly, there are certain aspects and 
elements of security here. There are such provisions, and so 
on. But, as they say, history and mankind know instances when 
such guarantees were given, when there were agreements, but 
there was the Second World War despite these bilateral and 
multilateral agreements, and 22 million people died and the 
economies in a whole number of countries were destroyed. This 
is why one should rely on God but have his own mind, as they 
say. Both our military and scientific potentials should work 
toward ensuring our state security -- not at the expense of 
nuclear weapons now but at the expense of other highly effective 
means. Such measures are being taken today. This is why, 
simultaneously with the reduction and elimination of nuclear 
weapons, fulfilling that resolution by the Supreme Council, we 
should work concurrently toward ensuring the combat readiness of 
our Armed Forces. Our commission, together with military 
departments, is carrying out this work. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Such is the attitude of People's Deputy 
Oleksandr 
Tarasenko, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council Commission for 
Issues of Defense and State Security, toward the trilateral 
statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and 
Russia on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Nursultan Nazarbayev was warmly 
welcomed everywhere by Dnepropetrovsk oblast residents. 
  [Begin Nazarbayev recording, in Russian] During our 
negotiations with President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk in Kiev 
yesterday, and during our conversation with chairman of the 
Dnepropetrovsk oblast administration Pavlo Ivanovych 
[Lazarenko], we were saying how greatly our economic ties have 
diminished in these past few years! Last year alone, the trade 
turnover between Russia and Kazakhstan amounted to 1.650 billion 
dollars. Experts believe it should equal 5 or 6 billion. 
  Kazakhstan used to have terrific ties with Dnepropetrovsk 
oblast alone, and now they are reduced by 50 percent. What does 
it mean? No goods are supplied to Kazakhstan while people are 
losing jobs here. When no relevant products are supplied to us, 
we are unable to launch a certain production line. Everybody 
loses in the long run. 
  Now that we have recovered from euphoria and grasped the 
situation, we must gradually set up horizontal ties. We must 
all now think how we can bring people together, how we can lift 
the border barriers, how we can establish freedom of movement, 
and how we can help each other's economies find their feet 
again? [end recording]

<F P=106> [Declaration signed by President Leonid Kravchuk and </F>
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev on 20 January in Kiev] 
  [Text] On Friday 21 January, Ukraine's media circulated the 
following declaration issued jointly by presidents Kravchuk of 
Ukraine and Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan: Modern World, Challenges 
and Threats: 
  The 20th Century is drawing to a close, mankind is preparing 
to enter a new epoch of its development. History has 
accelerated its pace, making mankind both a participant in and 
an eyewitness to global -- in terms of their consequences- - 
changes in the world structure. The world has become 
increasingly more open and interdependent. 
  The epoch of the two systems and military-political blocs' 
great confrontation has fallen into oblivion. The global 
community of nations has been joined on par by many peoples who 
have established their new independent states. Concurrently 
positive changes on the European and Asian continents have been 
accompanied by emerging new challenges and dangers: interethnic 
conflicts, which are becoming sharper; emergence of security 
vacuum zones; attempts to destabilize the newly independent 
nations from outside and setting the spheres of influence are 
among them. All these demand urgent and adequate measures and 
decisions. 
  While adhering to the principles of the world community and 
global security's indivisibility Ukraine and Kazakhstan believe 
that threats to any country's national security pose a danger 
for general security and peace the world over. The world's 
politics should be guided by axiomatic principles of one's own 
security through security of all and domestic stability 
contributing to global stability. Concerns which exist in the 
field of national security of a number of states may be 
eliminated only by way of estimating an inter-regional universal 
security system, extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok and 
including all the nations without exception. Such international 
organizations and institutions as the UN, CSCE, NATO, the North 
Atlantic Alliance Council and others play an important role in 
this process. 
  The concept of Partnership for Peace, which was endorsed by 
NATO member nations' heads of state, has great potential. Its 
realization will allow to expand the framework of stability 
peace and trust among nations. The past decade's major event 
was the establishment of new independent states on the former 
Soviet Union's territory. Wishing to construct new civilized 
relations among them based on sovereign equality, parity, good 
neighbourliness, noninterference and mutual respect are nations 
who have behind them a common long and thorny historical road 
decided to set up their commonwealth to assist each other in 
overcoming the hard consequences of the totalitarian epoch and 
retain their good and mutually beneficial relations which really 
promote and consolidate friendship among our peoples. 
  The Commonwealth of Independent States has existed for over 
two years now. Its evolution has been difficult and 
controversial, with intermittent instability and crisis periods 
sometimes aggravating into sharp conflict situations. Yet the 
two years of the CIS existence may be referred to, with all the 
due responsibility, as having summarized the fact that global 
cataclysms and (?societal) turmoil on the former USSR's 
territory were avoided, which had been forecast by some 
politicians. The process of the new nations accedance to the 
world community was accelerated and foundations laid for 
consolidation of our major priceless gain, that independence and 
the right to dispose of one's own destiny. 
  Ukraine and Kazakhstan are both multiethnic entities intent 
on constructing their open democratic societies who base their 
development on retention and consolidation of interethnic and 
social peace and accord. We are aware of the tremendous 
significance of keeping civic and interethnic stability in our 
nations and other CIS member states and declare our full 
determination to further continue this course. 
  In view of this deep concerns have been generated by certain 
trends which have surfaced in the international situation both 
within the CIS as a whole and in some of its individual member 
nations. We have no right to shut our eyes to the fact that of 
late irresponsible forces have been active which are calling for 
the totalitarian regime's reanimation igniting interethnic 
strife, xenophobia, chauvinism, nationalism, and propagating 
destructive ideas which contradict the UN Charter and the CSCE 
principles. 
  These alien to civilized international relations phenomena 
have recently been condemned by foreign ministers of the CSCE 
member nations and the CIS heads of state. We declare with full 
responsibility that any support for aggressive national 
patriotism, imperial chauvinism, national exclusiveness, and 
intolerance which are being propagated by certain extremist 
political circles may result in destructive consequences of 
global dimensions. We draw the attention of all sober minded 
politicians, CIS peoples, the entire world community to the need 
of joining efforts in a bid to prevent further dissemination of 
ideas based upon propagation of fascism, calls to imperial 
expansionism and attempts at their realization which pose a 
threat not only to the new independent nations but to the entire 
world. 
  Ukraine and Kazakhstan, who have voluntarily chosen a road 
to 
getting rid of the most devastating and lethal weapons in human 
history, nuclear weapons, can not but feel deep concern over 
their security, which they do not think as possible outside the 
context of universal international security. We appeal to all 
interested nations and governments, democratic forces, and the 
world public to double their efforts directed toward 
construction of a safer and more stable world based on 
cooperation, mutual assistance, and deep mutual respect among 
nations. 
  Ukraine and Kazakhstan, acting jointly or parallelly [as 
heard] will strive for creation of an atmosphere of mutual 
understanding and trust, will engage in mutual beneficial trade 
and economic cooperation, and will make their weighty 
contributions to consolidation of regional and global security 
and stability. 
  The text of the declaration issued jointly by President 
Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Nursultan Nazarbayev of 
Kazakhstan.

  [Excerpt] Kiev, 20 January -- [passage omitted] Answering 
a question on whether he would use the right granted to him by 
the constitutional amendment adopted today allowing him to 
cancel acts by the Republic of the Crimea's bodies of executive 
power should they contravene Ukrainian laws and presidential 
directives, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said: If 
Crimea's bodies of power violate the constitution and laws of 
Ukraine, including the law of Ukraine on delimiting powers 
between Ukraine and the Crimea, I will undoubtedly bring all 
actions by Crimean authorities into accordance with state 
interests.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yefim Shvartsman] </F>
  [Text] Kiev January 24 TASS -- The Ukrainian leadership is 
seriously concerned over the character of political 
confrontation in the Crimea following the first round of 
presidential elections there on January 16. This anxiety was 
expressed in the Sunday analytical programme Perekryostok 
(Crossroads) of Ukrainian TV. 
  Perekryostok reminded people once again of the right, 
granted 
to President Kravchuk by the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of 
Ukraine, to cancel resolutions of local government authorities 
running counter to the Ukrainian constitution (in the opinion of 
observers, the presidential elections in the Crimea are just the 
case), and gave the floor to Yevgeniy Marchuk, head of the 
Ukrainian security service. He described the situation as 
criminally dangerous and urged the rivals to act within the 
limits set by the law. 
  Taking into account the polarization of opinions in the 
Crimea itself over the future of the peninsula before the second 
round of the presidential elections, scheduled for January 30, 
as well as the fact that two obviously political assassinations 
took place in the Crimea over the past month (Captain Andrey 
Lazebnikov, head of the press service of the Black Sea Fleet, 
was killed in Sevastopol last December and Iskander Mamedov, 
deputy to the Crimean parliament from the Crimean Tatars, died 
of wounds in Simferopol last Friday, following an attempt on his 
life), one cannot but agree that the concern of the head of the 
Ukrainian security service is well-grounded and his warning is 
timely.

  [Text] A large-scale military exercise by the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces is planned in the Crimea for the end of January. 
In connection with this, representatives of a number of Crimean 
organizations are pointing out that these maneuvers are being 
carried out just before the second round of presidential 
elections in the Crimea, scheduled for 30 January. Meanwhile, 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service has reported that 
the exercises set for January are planned and represent training 
for territorial defense.

  [Text] Simferopol, 20 January -- The Crimean Supreme 
Council Presidium has appealed to the peninsula's population in 
connection with the Day of the Republic of the Crimea. It is 
said in the appeal, in particular, that in the time that has 
passed (since gaining autonomy) the course taken toward the 
Crimea gradually attaining statehood has proved to be right. 
"With the interests of all the peoples populating the Crimea 
taken into consideration, a possibility for the Crimea to become 
a bridge uniting Russia and Ukraine, with and peace and civic 
accord on the peninsula preserved and not undermined, the will 
of the Crimeans, has been realized. Recreating the republic, 
adopting its own constitution, delimiting powers between itself 
and Ukraine, and signing economic agreements are all difficult 
but necessary means of creating preconditions for the Crimea to 
be economically independent. The elections of the president and 
Supreme Council of the Crimea will complete this rather short 
but important stage in the history of the Crimea. The future 
destiny of the republic is in the hands of the Crimeans 
themselves," the statement notes.

  [Text] Sevastopol -- The coordinating council of the city 
branch of the Republican Party of Crimea [RPK] sent a statement 
to the presidents and parliaments of Russia and Ukraine on 21 
January saying: "The outcome of the first round of presidential 
elections in the Republic of Crimea revealed the real balance of 
political forces which took shape as a result of the Ukrainian 
Government's antipopular policy based on unitarianism and 
nationalism." The statement also stresses that the presidential 
elections pose no contradiction to Ukraine's laws and 
constitution and are held in full compliance with the law "On 
division of powers between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine." 
In the Republicans' opinion, this was also confirmed by 
Ukraine's Ministry of Justice in reply to a query whether 
Sevastopol had the right to take part in these elections. 
  The Sevastopol branch of the RPK said that the measures 
taken 
by the government and president of Ukraine to restrict Crimea's 
powers and the rights of the people of the autonomous republic 
may become the last straw which will spark off a big fire. If 
the Crimean people, who will be electing their president, see 
the expression of their will ignored, "we will have to appeal to 
the world community, specifically, to the United Nations," the 
statement says.

  [Text] Simferopol, 21 Jan -- In a statement issued to the 
press, Yuriy Meshkov, the chairman of the Republican Party of 
the Crimea [RPK] and Crimean presidential candidate, emphasized 
in particular that President Kravchuk had his confidence, since 
he had not had any objections to holding the elections on the 
peninsula and apparently did not consider holding them to be 
illegal. Therefore, the RPK leader is hopeful he will be able 
to come to an agreement with President Kravchuk and develop 
relations between the Crimea and Ukraine in accordance with 
current legislation and the norms of international law. In the 
event of his election as president, Yuriy Meshkov added, one 
should not fear that interethnic relations would exacerbate.

  [Text] The possible cancellation of the second round of 
presidential elections in the Crimea by the Ukrainian 
authorities will lead to a sharp aggravation of the relations 
between Ukraine and Russia, the leader of the Republican Party 
of the Crimea, candidate for the Crimean presidency from the 
bloc "Russia," Yuriy Meshkov, told Interfax. In his opinion, 
such a decision would be a violation of the international acts 
on human rights whose legitimate character is confirmed by the 
authorities in Kiev." 
  Meshkov believes that "the Russian State Duma in its present 
composition will react to such violations of human rights very 
tough putting Russia's state administration in an embarrassing 
situation." "It (the Russian administration -- Interfax's note) 
will have to either agree with the State Duma and extremely 
heighten tensions between Ukraine and Russia, or oppose to the 
Duma's decision and bring closer early presidential elections," 
Meshkov stated. 
  The candidate pointed out that "neither this, nor that 
variant is desirable for Ukraine" hoping for that "Leonid 
Makarovich Kravchuk, being a sophisticated and clever 
politician, will avoid making wrong decisions." 
  Meshkov met with the Black Sea Fleet commander, Admiral 
Eduard Baltin, in Sevastopol on January 21. The fleet's press 
service said the parties "discussed the results of the first 
round of presidential elections in the Crimea and the prospects 
for the developments in the region." 
  At the Crimean presidential elections on January 16, Meshkov 
canvassed a majority of votes and left behind his closest rival, 
current Crimean Speaker Nikolai Bagrov. The two candidates will 
race for presidency at the second round of the elections 
scheduled for January 30. 
  During the meeting, Baltin said that the fleet's command was 
ready to maintain a constructive dialogue with any party or 
movement which understand the fleet's problems and take them 
close to heart, the press service pointed out.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 21 Jan -- "The decision for the Black Sea 
Fleet to remain Russian--and it must be fully implemented--does 
not raise any doubts," Yuriy Meshkov, candidate for the 
presidency of Crimea and leader of the Republican Party of 
Crimea, said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS today. 
  The leader of the Crimean Republicans, who won approximately 
40 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential 
elections, while speaking in favor of an independent Republic of 
Crimea "which would maintain multi-faceted ties with Ukraine 
and, independently of these ties, would determine the forms of 
economic relations with Russia," thought that the sympathies of 
the population of the peninsula are on the side of the "Russia" 
opposition bloc which he represents. Yuriy Meshkov pointed out 
that the rest of the votes were distributed between the 
supporters of the Communist and Russia Parties. He noted that 
"not a single external force is capable of upsetting our 
progress toward closer relations with the republics of the 
former USSR and uniting the Russian and Ukrainian peoples." 
Yuriy Meshkov is convinced that his voters would be able to 
consolidate their positions in the second round of the elections 
and ensure a victory in the presidential race for the leader of 
the Crimean republicans. 
  Replying to the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question about the 
reasons behind the increase in crime in Crimea since the murder 
of Andrey Lazebnikov, head of the Black Sea Fleet's press 
service at the end of 1993, Yuriy Meshkov said that these "are 
the consequences of the full atrophy of the present Crimean 
leadership and its inability to maintain law and order in the 
region." In the event of his victory in the presidential 
elections the leader of the Crimean republicans promises "to 
establish order and eliminate organized crime in the peninsula." 
  In Yuriy Meshkov's view, the implementation of the 
tripartite 
agreement on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine 
signed in Moscow on 14 January by the presidents of Russia, the 
United States, and Ukraine, would make it possible "to 
significantly reduce tension in the world and contribute to 
strengthening nuclear security throughout the world." 
  Commenting on the removal of Ivan Yermakov from the post of 
the Ukrainian president's representative in Sevastopol, Yuriy 
Meshkov told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that this decision was 
made by the Ukrainian leadership "out of political motives." At 
the same time, he noted, "Yermakov who has been enrolled in the 
staff of the Black Sea Fleet, should be proud of this 
appointment." It is known that Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander 
of the fleet, issued an order on 20 December enrolling under his 
command the former representative of the Ukrainian president in 
Crimea.

  [Text] Crimea's secession from Ukraine is out of the 
question; [leader of the Republican Party of Crimea] Yuriy 
Meshkov's policy of promising people to take them into Russia's 
arms is a road to nowhere, Mykola Bahrov, chairman of the 
Crimean Supreme Council, told the press. He urged people to 
take a serious view of the situation. 
  He said: The Helsinki Accords established the inviolability 
of borders fixed after World War II. There is an agreement 
between Russia and Ukraine reaffirming the inviolability of the 
two countries' borders. Finally, a trilateral agreement on 
nuclear arms elimination containing the same stipulations was 
signed in Moscow between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. 
Ukraine received guarantees not only from the United States, 
but also from European states, the Crimean parliament speaker 
stressed. Only a naive person can think that Russia will risk 
violating these agreements, Mykola Bahrov said.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk "is drafting a 
document on presidential elections in Crimea," the Crimean 
Majles leader Mustafa Jamilev reported to Interfax. In his 
words, Kravchuk is to assess the results of the first round of 
voting in Crimea shortly. The pro-Russian candidate Yuriy 
Meshkov won that round, collecting twice the number of votes 
(about 40%) than his runner-up Nikolay Bahrov, the Crimean 
Parliament's Chairman. 
  In Jamilev's opinion, the Ukrainian leadership "made several 
mistakes in regard to Crimea." The main error, according to 
him, was "Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as an autonomous 
republic after a referendum on January 20, 1991." 
  The Majles leader foresees possible conflicts in the 
peninsula, if Meshkov becomes president of Crimea. He called 
Meshkov "a hypocrite without principle" and said that "Kiev is 
aware of that." He revealed that "the Majles leadership has been 
in close touch with Kiev by telephone." 
  He believes that "Crimean chauvinists are backed up by some 
elements in Russia morally and materially." "To avoid tension 
with Ukraine," he stressed, "Russia should somehow restrain the 
Crimean separatists." One such measure, in his view, could be 
Moscow's pledge not to make territorial claims to Ukraine. 
  At a session in Simferopol today, Majles is to announce its 
position toward the second round of presidential elections 
scheduled for January 30 in Crimea.

<F P=106> [Article by Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine's </F>
minister of defense: "Where Did You See an Army Without a 
Budget?"] 
  [Text] The building of Ukraine's Armed Forces has been 
under way for more than two years. It might seem that this is 
not such a long stretch of time. However, looking back and 
analyzing the path that has been covered, one can see with 
particular clarity not only all of our achievements, but also 
problems and shortcomings. I would like to consider some of 
them separately. 
  We inherited a considerable military formation from the 
former Soviet Army. However, in terms of structure and military 
equipment, it did not conform to those tasks that arose before 
Ukraine with regard to ensuring its own defense capability. At 
the first stage, we tried to reform those Union army forces into 
Ukraine's Armed Forces. However, later, it became clear that 
Ukraine needs an army that would not be a successor to any other 
army, that would possess characteristics reflecting the 
historical and national traditions, would be based upon its own 
infrastructure, and would take into account our states's 
specific geostrategic situation and other characteristics. As a 
consequence, we became convinced that it is not reforms that we 
must occupy ourselves with, but the building of our own Armed 
Forces. Of course, one cannot avoid problems in this demanding 
work. 
  Among the problems that I am particularly concerned with, 
the 
problem of the personnel occupies the primary position. In 
those decisive months when Ukraine was acquiring the status and 
the characteristics of an independent state, some people who did 
not really care about the state's sovereignty, but only wanted 
to keep their "cushy jobs," benefits enjoyed by the 
nomenklatura, and so on managed to get into the leadership of 
the Defense Ministry. Of course, they did not really bother to 
build the Ukrainian Army in the best possible way. We can now 
see the consequences of such work particularly well. We have 
been gradually ridding ourselves of the services of such people 
over the entire period of existence of Ukraine's Armed Forces 
and are still removing them. 
  We must adhere to one criterion: The serviceman's high 
military professionalism based upon the highest level of general 
and special training, his way of life, spiritual state, way of 
thinking, and activity. Competence, responsibility for the 
assigned task, and loyalty to Ukraine are those qualities that 
we must take as a basis for distinguishing a military 
professional from a time-serving dilettante. 
  The general public knows how many emotions erupted, in 
particular around the question of reforming military education. 
The Ministry of Defense and the head of the military education 
administration in person were criticized in the press for the 
errors, shortcomings, and distortions in that work. In many 
cases, that criticism was justified. Therefore, we need to put 
in much effort to rectify the situation. However, in my 
opinion, a new, more experienced and better qualified person 
must head this work and the main administration for educational 
work. 
  Many people remember the controversial reaction to the 
Ukrainian presidential edict on unifying the Air Force and Air 
Defense into Air Defense Troops. There were radically opposed 
opinions, and there was a real battle in the press. It was for 
a good reason. Today, it must be admitted that this step was 
untimely. Even despite the fact that, with the exception of 
Russia, China, and Romania, all other states of the world have 
these types of armed forces unified. I am sure that Ukraine 
must proceed to such unification gradually, in a balanced 
manner, and without haste, in order to avoid impairing our 
defense capability. 
  Well, for the time being, our Air Force and Air Defense 
function separately. The only acute problem that bothers them 
is the shortage of fuel. 
  Thus, the reform in military education, the attempt to 
hastily create Air Defense Troops, and the difficulties with 
building our own Naval Forces -- these and a number of other 
objective and subjective factors could but hamper the processes 
of building Ukraine's Armed Forces. The insufficiently skilled 
personnel and the shortage of money have further intensified the 
problem. Nor can one refrain from putting blame upon members of 
the Defense Ministry Military Board, deputy ministers, chiefs of 
administration, or commanders of the Armed Forces and military 
districts. 
  Yet another acute problem is the fact that we have not had a 
defense budget for two years. Precisely its absence has become 
one of the main reasons for neglecting such constituents upon 
which the state's defense capability is based: science, the 
military-industrial complex, and the army. 
  Today, those scientists who must work for defense are in a 
difficult situation -- they must think of how to survive, 
instead of creating something new. 
  The situation at Ukraine's defense enterprises is not much 
better: Some of them stand completely idle, while at others, 
individual workshops and technological lines with most 
up-to-date equipment do not work. There are no state orders and 
no money. As a result, highly skilled specialists are leaving 
en masse. I could see that with my own eyes during numerous 
visits to enterprises of the military-industrial complex. 
  World experience indicates that armed forces must be built 
on 
the basis of the achievements of military science and the most 
expedient utilization of the possibilities of defense 
enterprises. 
  It is clear that for this we need funding. A separate fund 
for science, a separate one for the military industrial complex, 
and again a separate fund for maintaining the army. Of course, 
this will come up to quite a large figure, but we cannot do 
without large outlays if we want to be reliably protected. 
  Several variants of the defense budget have already been 
elaborated by corresponding specialists. The documents have now 
been submitted to the Ukrainian president. It is possible that 
Ukraine's Supreme Council will discuss and approve the best of 
them in the second half of January. It is true, though, that 
Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy is already 
insisting that the defense budget be reduced. 
  One often hears complaints about the numerical strength of 
Ukraine's Armed Forces. Some people say that the Army could be 
smaller and would, in that case, require much less money. At 
present, the Ukrainian Army has 533,000 servicemen. In 
accordance with world norms, the variant in which 1 percent of 
the state's population serves in the army is considered optimal. 
Therefore, all grumbling about the size of the Army is 
groundless. However, notwithstanding this, we are planning to 
reduce the Army to between 300,000 and 350,000 servicemen by the 
year 2000. This cannot be done in one go, as it is necessary to 
provide those servicemen who are demobilized with housing and 
work. Incidentally, many people are now willing to leave the 
Army. They are not satisfied with low salaries, delays with 
payments, problems with obtaining uniforms, and the absence of 
housing.... In 1994, the Army will be reduced by 90,000 persons. 
  The problem of introducing the Ukrainian language in our 
troops is not simple. This problem is further aggravated by the 
relatively small number of officers with a command of the 
language and by the absence of special military literature in 
the state language. It is only with the help of a sufficient 
financing of the instruction process and with a deep conviction 
on the part of our soldiers that they need to master the 
Ukrainian language that we will be able to get rid of the 
shortcomings fast and with good results. 
  It is necessary for every serviceman to be deeply convinced 
that he needs to study the language and the glorious history of 
Ukraine, its customs, traditions, and culture not only for his 
own general and spiritual development, but also in order to be 
proud of being the son of this land, of having grown on it and 
nurtured by it, for which he must ardently love it. The main 
thing is that he must be aware of the high honor of defending 
Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity with weapons. 
  Our army has recently been reproached for remaining aloof 
with regard to political activity. I must point out that this 
is not my own invention or whim. Ukraine's legislation has 
determined that total departmentalization of the Armed Forces is 
one of the main principles of building them. The Army is a 
state structure and, like in any law-governed state, it must 
adhere to the government's political line and not meander among 
the positions of various parties and movements. Isn't this 
right? 
  Many people are presently concerned about such serious 
problems as the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine and about 
the division of the Black Sea Fleet among Ukraine and Russia. 
It looks as if, this year, the question of strategic weapons 
will finally be resolved based upon the tripartite agreement 
between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. Compensation 
has been promised to us for the tactical weapons withdrawn from 
Ukraine back in 1992. 
  As regards the Black Sea Fleet, the settlement of this 
problem is in the interests of both Ukraine and Russia. That is 
why this question must not be resolved through confrontation or 
by way of grabbing as much as possible, when economic and 
political difficulties are taken advantage of, but with mutual 
respect and through interaction and cooperation in this region 
between our two states. 
  In conclusion, I want to gladden the hearts of those parents 
whose sons will serve in our army: The restoration by the 
Supreme Council of the two-year long army service that led to a 
wave of misunderstanding among the civilian population is a 
temporary measure. This step was due to the complication that 
emerged last fall as a result of the simultaneous dismissal to 
the reserve of two categories of conscripts -- both those who 
had served two years and those who served one and one-half 
years. Incidentally, even after the Supreme Council decision, 
the period of service will be between 18 and 20 months, and not 
a full two years. 
  One more thing: During meetings with the civilian 
population, I often have to answer questions on whether the 
Ukrainian people may now sleep peacefully. I assure you with 
all responsibility -- our Armed Forces are capable of defending 
their people and Ukraine's independence.

  [Text] The tense situation on the Nagorno-Karabakh front 
lines has eased. Considering the many men and armored vehicles 
they have lost in the fighting, the Azerbaijan military forces 
have reduced the number of their attacks. The Narogno-Karabakh 
Republic [NKR] military headquarters has disclosed that 
Azerbaijan lost 117 officers and men in the fighting that took 
place on the evening on 19 January. Four tanks were hit in the 
clashes. Meanwhile, the NKR's casualties were six men killed 
and 13 wounded. 
  Azerbaijan's military forces resumed their attacks against 
Mardakertskiy Rayon at 0700 this morning. Reports say that the 
fighting was still continuing at noon. The NKR forces quickly 
blocked the enemy's onslaught. 
  Two of Azerbaijan's military aircraft tried to violate NKR's 
airspace at 1330 today. 
  The number of deserters on the enemy side recently 
increased. 
In a statement to [name indistinct] news agency, Tahir Rakhimov, 
a prisoner of war of the Lezgin nationality, said that the 
Lezgins in Azerbaijan are immigrating to Russia. He also said 
that his community does not wish to fight for the sake of 
another community. 
  Clashes took place in the vicinity of Mardakert and [name 
indistinct] this afternoon. The NKR forces successfully blocked 
all the enemy attacks. Both sides suffered casualties in the 
clashes. The outcome of the fighting is still unknown. 
  Azerbaijan's military forces directed their attacks against 
Kenterly and Panakhly in Agdamskiy Rayon at 1600 today. 
However, the enemy was forced to retreat. Violent clashes took 
place at about 1800. The Azerbaijani troops and the Armenian 
forces alternated in achieving success in the clashes. 
  Meanwhile, two Azerbaijani military aircraft violated NKR 
airspace and fired on peaceful residential areas this afternoon. 
No information is available on casualties. 
  The sides have avoided serious operations in the 
southeastern 
sector of the front line.

  [Text] Stepanakert, January 21 (SNARK) -- January 21 
morning was characterized by relative peace at the Karabakh 
frontier. As SNARK was informed by the press-service of 
Headquarters of the Karabakh Defence Army, there was only 
positional exchange of fire in Mardakertskiy, Martuninskiy, 
Agdamskiy and Fizulinskiy regions. The most of the tension over 
the last 24 hours was in the front line part located in the 
north-west of Karabakh -- by the Omar pass, where military 
clashes took place. Today, about 11.30 a.m. several attack 
planes of the Azerbaijani Air Forces tried to violate Karabakh's 
air space. The details are being verified.

<F P=106> [Report by Armen Khanbabyann under the "Nagorno-Karabakh" </F>
rubric: Karabakh: Fighting Intensifies as Azeris Shoot at Each 
Other"] 
  [Text] Starting in the early morning of 19 January, Azeri 
infantry and armored vehicles launched an attack on the 
positions of Karabakh's self-defense army virtually along the 
entire perimeter of the standoff -- from Omar pass in the north 
to Goradiz in the southeast. The more sustained fighting was 
going on in Mardakert Rayon in the direction of the settlement 
of Magavuz. According to Nagorno-Karabakh's press department, 
Karabakh subunits managed to hold back the enemy pressure by the 
close of 19 January, inflicting on it appreciable losses in 
personnel -- up to 100 killed -- and materiel. The Azeri Air 
Force at the same time once again tried to bomb Stepanakert but 
was chased away by antiaircraft artillery fire. On the morning 
of 19 January, Karabakh fighters witnessed a more than two-hour 
battle between two Azeri battalions outside the population 
center of Karakhanbeyli. It is still not clear whether that was 
a shoot-out between two rival commanders, or whether the Azeris 
simply had mistaken each other for the enemy. 
  Military experts believe that despite the extremely 
difficult 
situation, the Karabakh Army is capable of holding the front 
whereas possible Azeri successes may at this stage be of only 
local nature and should not result in appreciable changes in the 
sides' positions. The active participation of Russian and 
Ukrainian mercenaries is not so far producing the expected 
impact upon the overall situation, although, as commanders 
certify, some battalions formed from the "Slavic" contingent are 
fighting very vigorously, and it is hard to withstand their 
pressure. In particular, the encirclement of Armenian units 
near the settlement of Magavuz had been organized by two such 
battalions. 
  The conviction taking shape in Armenia is that the offensive 
efforts by the Azeri Army have been caused exclusively by 
political expediency. Before the meeting in Moscow of the 
leaders of the two Transcaucasus states and Russia, the men in 
Baku would very likely want the talks to begin in a different 
military-political situation. The men in Moscow would possibly 
want the same: The gamble is that should the Azeri side manage 
to inflict a major defeat on the Karabakhis, Yerevan's and 
Stepanakert's stance at the talks according to the plan 
suggested by Russia may be much softer. At any rate, Azerbaijan 
is continuing its offensive regardless of losses. The latter, 
meanwhile, have reached unprecedented proportions. In little 
more than a month, the Azeri Army lost some 5,000 men. In Baku, 
this circumstance sparked internal political tensions because 
casualties sustained so far are not measuring up in any way to 
success at the front.

  [Text] Yerevan, January 21 (SNARK) -- The so called "regime 
number 8" is retained in Yerevan. It signifies that the 
population receives electricity only for an hour or 40 minutes a 
day. Samvel Mavisakalyan, the Deputy Mayor of Yerevan, has 
informed of it SNARK today. In his opinion it would be possible 
to supply people with 4 hours of electricity only if necessary 
amount of gas reach Armenia. Mavisakalyan told Yerevan receives 
the 40 per cent of all the electricity produced in Armenia.

<F P=106> [From the "Behind the Scenes" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Video shows reflection of cooling tower in pool 
of water] [Reporter] The flagship of the Armenian power 
generating industry -- a station which used to meet almost half 
the demand for electricity -- has been standing idle for five 
years now. [Video shows Suren Azatyan, director of the Armenian 
Nuclear Power Station, identified by caption] 
  [Azatyan] I find it very hard to take when this superb 
station suddenly finds itself a consumer of electricity. It 
would be quite wrong to say it was shut down because of the 
earthquake. I personally see no connection at all, no link 
between the two. But the other aspect -- of improving safety -- 
is very topical and something that is indeed important. 
  [Reporter] Of course, the shutdown of the station isn't the 
only reason for the very severe power crisis in Armenia. 
Blockades, the increased cost of energy sources, and the 
breakdown of normal economic ties have taken their toll too. 
But the station used to generate 800 megawatts a day -- almost 
three times more than all of Armenia's hydroelectric and heat 
and electric power stations put together. And the loss of those 
megawatts is keenly felt by industry and ordinary people. 
[passage omitted] Nobody anywhere in the world has ever 
mothballed a nuclear power station and then tried to restart it. 
Under a program scheduled to take 18 months, it is planned 
initially to restart just one of the two power units -- the 
407-megawatt no. 2 unit. The work will be in three phases: 
checks or inventory-taking; then precommissioning proper, 
including the replacement of equipment; and finally startup. 
Only phase one has so far been completed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav </F>
Shushkevich by Yuliy Semenov of Ostankino Television, Lyudmila 
Telen of MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and journalist Igor Rudometov; 
Shushkevich and Rudometov speak from a Minsk studio, Semenov and 
Telen are in the Moscow studio; from the "Live Dialogue" 
program--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Semenov] You know, journalists always look for 
something extraordinary to start a conversation, and I also 
propose to start our conversation with a scandal, although not 
with a scandal between you and me, of course -- I hope that 
everything will be fine between us on the air -- but with the 
political scandal which has stirred the Belarus Supreme Soviet 
over the last few days. [passage omitted] So Stanislav 
Stanislavovich, perhaps it is not a very pleasant topic for 
conversation, but today I think it is unavoidable. What is your 
attitude toward this situation? 
  [Shushkevich] Good afternoon, esteemed viewers. Esteemed 
Yuliy Aleksandrovich, of course this topic is not the best way 
to start a conversation, but we should be ready to consider any 
question. I have probably spent the last three days thinking 
about this question above all others. I would like to separate 
it from the essence of the accusations and so on and so forth, 
because they are different issues. 
  Here we have a very clear example of our inability to work 
in 
the new conditions, that is, when we become a truly legal state. 
We are seeing that law by telephone continues to operate in 
Belarus. That is, a sanction is issued over the telephone by 
the procurator general, and it seems to represent an 
authorization to act completely freely from then on. The 
parliament has been analyzing this situation for a long time, 
and I can say that yes, unfortunately written laws are being 
violated in the upper echelons of authority, the upper echelons 
of our law-enforcing bodies. 
  We sometimes ask why this or that law is not working, or why 
something is not happening; after all, the laws are written. 
There are structures that must make them known and structures 
that must study them and implement them religiously. And we are 
seeing the violation of those laws. That is unfortunately a 
fact, a sad fact, and it will serve as a bitter lesson for the 
whole Supreme Council, for the republic's law-enforcing 
structures, and probably for a wider group of people as well. 
  [Semenov] Do you see any legal problem here for the CIS as a 
whole? For instance, some states have agreements between 
themselves on legal assistance, others do not. You see, there 
have been cases when representatives of certain Central Asian 
countries have caught members of their own oppositions here in 
Moscow. Is there a possibility that tomorrow Azerbaijan will 
demand the extradition of Mutalibov and Vezirov in connection 
with the accusations that are being directed toward them? Is 
there a legal mechanism for such cases? Should not the special 
services of some countries work on the territory of other 
countries, all the more so if it is openly and legally? What do 
you think? 
  [Shushkevich] You are absolutely right. These are ordinary 
things that one can well understand. I would point out that 
Russia is probably the most careful implementer of such an 
approach, and so I do not understand your concern, especially 
your strange examples. I did indeed touch on similar issues both 
with the Russian procurator general and even with the president 
-- I hope he will forgive me for taking the liberty of 
mentioning it. But I perceived an entirely correct and cool 
approach here: everything must be carried out according to the 
letter of the law. 
  Such a legal accord does not exist between many states of 
the 
USSR [as heard], but we do have such an agreement with 
Lithuania, and it is all the more regrettable that our services 
are not mature enough to implement this agreement. Because the 
procuracy, which worked for a week on this question with 
representatives of the Lithuanian procuracy, suddenly came forth 
with a verbal instruction. This of course is entirely irregular. 
And, therefore, the concern in the Supreme Council was natural. 
I hope that coolness will prevail and strict juridical rules 
will operate and this case will receive a proper assessment. 
  [Telen] Mr. Shushkevich, you said that this case will 
receive 
a proper assessment, but nevertheless the situation is still 
quite acute today. Clearly you and the Supreme Council will 
have to take some kind of action to settle the situation. How 
do you see the situation developing, and what do you intend to 
do in order to ease it? 
  [Shushkevich] Lyudmila Olegovna, you know the situation in 
Belarus quite well. I follow MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI and your 
writings closely. It is very difficult to forecast how the 
situation will develop. The thing is that we lack the 
analytical disposition and the coolness that a parliament should 
have. The parliament should not sink to score-settling, 
forgetting about its main business. 
  What do we have now? Those laws that would allow us to 
rectify the economic situation, as well as those corrections to 
the constitution -- or rather the solution of questions 
concerning the adoption of the new constitution -- are being 
held up by political score-settling. It is not always Supreme 
Council business; the cases when it is the business of the 
council are exceptional. Because whatever happens, the work of 
the council is paralyzed. 
  And you know, there are serious events ahead of us. There 
are very serious treaties ahead of us, of a kind not previously 
seen in practice between CIS states, and indeed it is difficult 
to find similar approaches anywhere else in the world. We have 
to work on this and work seriously. But a week has passed and 
we have made very little progress in the work of our session. 
So I repeat once again: Professionals, legal experts, and 
parliamentary commissions should work on issues, submit 
proposals, and not make decisions or turn the council into a 
commission of enquiry. That will be fruitless, because emotion 
will prevail over reason and the juridically correct approach. 
That must be avoided. 
  [Semenov] Before handing the floor to our Minsk colleague 
Igor Rudometov, I have a question here. Viewer Kuznetsov from 
the Moscow area has evidently been attentively following what 
has been happening in your country. He is interested in this. 
Some kinds of troop contingents have twice appeared in Minsk 
outside the Supreme Council. Is this so? And what was it 
connected with? 
  [Shushkevich] You know it seems to me that if the Moscow 
area 
has already been informed of this, our affairs are in quite a 
bad way. Unfortunately, one has here again a case of law by 
telephone -- or, you know, not even law, but an anonymous 
telephone call. According to the report I received from the 
commander of our interior troops, an anonymous telephone call 
led to the fact that, contrary to existing regulations under 
which contingents of interior troops cannot be moved from the 
locations where they are stationed without the sanction of the 
head of government and without the sanction of the interior 
minister, troops in our country were moved some 150-200 meters 
from the Supreme Council. 
  I asked why this occurred and I demanded a written 
explanation. The explanation was very simple. It said: I 
received a telephone call, and I was afraid that the deputies 
would not be treated with due respect when they emerged from the 
Supreme Council. But what I do not understand is that they do 
not come out of the council at that spot. These games take on 
an unpleasant character, and there have been some examples of 
this in neighboring countries. I think in general that the 
grave and tragic character of these events has not got through 
to the understanding of some of our leaders. 
  Within their understanding they almost want to play a little 
game with the troops. These games are very dangerous and are 
very dangerous for Belarus. I think that we must be very 
emphatic in this regard. 
  As far as I am concerned, I think that one such occasion was 
discussed at the security council during its preparation, and 
there were no grounds for bringing the troops out. All the 
subsequent events showed that there was no reason, that is to 
say, there was no attempt to destabilize the situation. Now we 
have run into it again and there was not even a hint of such an 
attempt, and again the troops were brought out. I consider it 
my duty in the most resolute way to address this issue tomorrow 
on the basis of the documents in my possession. It is essential 
in general to build a law-governed state and not a state where 
there can be methods of intimidation. I hope that Belarus will 
not be an example of such a state and that the Supreme Soviet 
and the government will do everything possible to see that no 
further such games take place on the territory of the Republic 
of Belarus and that such things do not occur. [passage omitted] 
  [Rudometov] Before we turn to purely economic questions, 
such 
as the single ruble zone, I'd like to read the following 
question. It's from Russia, from someone who describes himself 
as: Golubovich, a Belarusian living in Russia. Here goes: What 
were Shushkevich, Kravchuk, and Yeltsin guided by when in 
Belovezhskaya Pushcha, contrary to the will of the people -- 
that's the way the question is worded -- they were wrecking the 
Soviet Union? I won't make any comments on the question, I'm 
just passing on to you. 
  [Shushkevich] I have already spoken about it a thousand 
times. 
  If today I had to do everything all over again, I would not 
have been able to find a better way to ensure that we build 
legal relations between us in a civilized manner. I would have 
taken the same road. I believe that there are many negative 
phenomena both in the CIS and, on the whole, in individual 
countries; but the fact that this step was taken has averted 
much more evil events. I am proud of this step. 
  [Rudometov] Which leads us to the many questions we have 
about the single ruble zone. 
  [Semenov] We too have many such questions. Well, go ahead. 
  [Rudometov] OK, question number one: What is it? Why are 
there so many advocates and opponents on either side? One would 
naturally prefer to be rich and healthy rather than sick and 
poor, but what should we do now? 
  [Shushkevich, laughs] You know, the funny thing is that I 
cannot give a precise, comprehensive, and meaningful answer to 
the question of what it is. And neither can anybody else, I 
believe. What I can say is what aim it pursues, what I'd like it 
to be. It would be very good if we could have a single means of 
payment; it would be very good if we could pursue an agreed 
monetary policy; and it would be very good if we could make the 
settlement process less complicated. 
  And I'd like to say that Russia is in no way threatened by a 
unification with our financial system, even on those terms that 
have been formulated and have been denounced in Russia. Because 
in general, if, as it were, our Belarusian rubles turn into 
Russian ones, there will be no inflationary processes -- because 
we have so few that it poses no threat. 
  In fact, our enterprises are generally penniless. The 
absence of the financial means that we so often talk about is 
what we inherited from socialism. This is why I believe that it 
is a positive move, which should help us to stabilize the 
economy. 
  [Rudometov] But there is an opinion that in this case we are 
going to Russia as poor relations. 
  [Shushkevich] That will depend on what specific agreements 
we sign. I think that in the communique signed by Boris 
Nikolayevich Yeltsin and I, not a single line suggests that we 
are going to Russia as poor relations. In fact, we believe that 
we are uniting, that we are unifying the financial systems in 
order to enable both Russia and Belarus to gain profit because 
we will simplify a whole range of relations. 
  But I can tell you what is my main priority. For me the most 
important point is this: The economy of Belarus can be knocked 
out, it has in fact been knocked out; that is to say, it is in a 
sorry state. I will give you an example. In Russia prices went 
up eightfold last year, while here prices went up 28 times! In 
Russia, the dollar rate has increased threefold... By the way, 
I was asked about it during a TV program and I checked later and 
this is in fact true. Well, in Russia the dollar went up 
threefold, while here the increase was 16.5 times. This means 
that we are bad managers. Why? Here is the main problem: Our 
main market is Russia. This is a fact. And our exports there 
are of quite good quality. But if we include in the price of 
these goods the price of the Russian oil -- and it is a lot more 
expensive here than in Russia -- we end up with astronomical 
customs duties! Last year we had to pay $28 for one tonne of 
oil. If this oil is included in the price of our goods -- and 
our energy consumption is high -- our goods will end up being 
very expensive in Russia. Russia will not buy them. And the 
primary reason is the price of oil. If Russia does not buy 
goods, our industries will perish. We have no one else to sell 
the goods to, because oil is expensive and we will not be able 
to sell our goods anywhere else. 
  But look how this backfires on Russia. Enterprises producing 
these goods use spare parts made in Russia. There are so many 
of them -- and we are not talking about raw materials, but about 
engines, electronics, and the like. These Russian industries 
will in turn collapse because they will not have a market 
either. We are destroying a huge mechanical engineering 
industry, radio electronics, motor industry, tractor industry. 
We are ready to kill them through an unreasonable pricing 
policy. We have to stop this. And for me the solution is in 
unified prices for energy carriers. This is not a sacrifice for 
Russia. This is something that Russia must do. 
  I'd like to make one other remark in this connection. Please 
understand that Russia is a legal successor to the former Soviet 
Union on most points. It was not us who generated Chernobyl, it 
was not us, bear this in mind. But every product we sell there 
has a 5.2 percent Chernobyl tax, because otherwise we cannot 
bring these people out of their most difficult plight and 
resettle them somewhere they can live, and help them settle -- 
because there is no way they can stay where they are. 
  It was not us who led to a situation in which 15 percent of 
our budget -- mind you, 15 percent, which is more than what is 
spent on defense, on education, on culture, and many more things 
taken together -- 15 percent is spent on the Chernobyl tax. 
And, therefore, we cannot invest in industry even though it is 
now necessary that the state should support many positions in 
industry through planning. But we are deprived of this 
opportunity. Therefore, I believe that one has to move in the 
framework of a sensible treaty, understanding that there are no 
reasons, no grounds for the so-called Russian-speaking 
population who form a majority in Belarus -- there aren't that 
many Belarusian speakers -- there are no reasons for them to 
complain to Russia about some kind of policy against them -- it 
is not like in other countries. 
  [Semenov] You know, unfortunately not all your fellow 
countrymen share your view. The publication of a notorious 
article by Zenon Paznyak has created a stir in Moscow. Here I 
have Russian TV viewers' reaction to it. For my part I can only 
say -- I understand that we are probably placing you in an 
awkward position by mentioning this -- but this article has been 
noticed in Moscow, and it is understandably causing irritation 
among Russian readers. One cannot speak of the Russian people 
the way Zenon Paznyak does. And even though he is trying to 
frighten Belarusians with Zhirinovskiy, he comes very close to 
him in some respects, particularly in his use of language and 
the nature of arguments. 
  But let us now return to the subject of our discussion. You 
know, we understand your pain, your concern, particularly 
regarding Chernobyl. And TV viewers really welcome the fact 
that Russia and Belarus are coming closer together. [passage 
omitted] But there are also doubts on this point, connected 
with fears of some damage for Russia, particularly financial 
damage if funny money is exchanged one for one. Someone here 
tried to calculate Russia's financial loss. It can be as high 
as 1.6 quadrillion rubles. By the way, this figure is 
marginally higher than the annual budget of Ostankino. These 
are the estimated losses this exchange can bring the Russians 
due to inflation. Another problem is that there would be a 
second center for the emission of rubles. 
  [Shushkevich] Yulian Aleksandrovich, first of all I cannot 
leave unnoticed your remark concerning Zenon Paznyak's article. 
First of all I'd like to say that I categorically dissociate 
myself from such an approach. But I'd like to explain just one 
thing. You know what the trouble is? We can, all of us, 
Russia, Belarus, and many other countries, find in our previous 
history a whole range of incidents that can lead to a strained 
and apprehensive attitude to each other. But, you see, one 
cannot be partial in treating historical facts. I just don't 
know, with all those things about Malyuta Skuratov and 
oprichnina [Skuratov was Ivan the Terrible's henchman most 
associated with the 1565-72 practice of mass repressions, 
executions, and confiscation of land on suspicion of treason, 
known as oprichnina]. 
  Was not the oprichnina really calamitous for those who are 
now Belarusian-speaking, for those who live in these regions. 
And was it not calamitous for Russian citizens? I could go 
through history, and sometimes, you understand, the genocide 
carried out by the Russian authorities against the Russian 
people was so harsh and so tough that it was simply terrible. 
And now we are singling out one factor; that, for example, 
those same authorities that carried out genocide against the 
Russians more than any others also carried out genocide against 
the Belarusian people and that's what we'll build a policy upon! 
This is just juggling facts. I oppose this, and I want to say 
this: In our history there are many remarkable examples. We can 
always build and are continuing to build good relations. And 
the main criterion, the main approach, is the people: No article 
of any sort, including articles about the inhumanity of Russian 
Federation imperialism, will nurture anti-Russian Federation 
attitudes in our republic! As for unification, this is a 
difficult issue, I repeat. If we manage to resolve the main 
question, if Russia resolves the main question on pricing 
policy, then I assess it is a worthy solution. 
  And now as for the losses: I mentioned the figure of about 
15 
percent of our budget. This is a higher figure than the one you 
mentioned, and we are shelling out on Chernobyl expenditure -- 
although I repeat, we have never had, and do not now have, a 
single nuclear power engineering installation -- but why should 
we remain in isolation? According to contemporary calculations, 
we are indeed receiving assistance from the Russian Federation, 
but if you will excuse me saying so, in comparison with the sum 
you mentioned, this assistance is positively paltry, just 
peanuts. And so realistically speaking, given our previous 
history and given whose legal successors we are, we really do 
have a worthy package of agreements and they must be sacredly 
observed. And there is sufficiently good motivation and grounds 
for drawing these up. 
  [Telen] Mr. Shushkevich, if I may I should like to continue 
on this topic. The communique that you and the Russian 
president signed make considerably more difficult both your and 
his positions within your states. [passage omitted] Can you 
say, please, will you, as chairman of the Belarus Supreme 
Soviet, and President Yeltsin, as head of the Russian state, 
manage to convince your opponents and convince the people that 
this decision is for the well-being of both states? [passage 
omitted] What happens when Russian citizens are told today: 
unification with the Belarus monetary system means an extra 10 
percent inflation a month? Does it not seem to you that this 
could make relations between peoples more difficult rather than 
easier? 
  [Shushkevich] Lyudmila Olegovna, first of all I don't want 
to 
give an opinion on who has been saying what and how about 
joining or not joining the Russian Government. But I ought to 
say that it is difficult to find a politician in Russia for whom 
I have more respect than Yegor Gaydar or Boris Fedorov, and I 
could name many others who have and haven't joined the Russian 
Government. 
  The matter is this: Either the Russian reforms, the monetary 
approach, were excessively intensive and corrections are now 
needed, that is, they went slightly in the wrong direction, or 
they were largely correct. There are official declarations 
everywhere that the reforms are continuing and that the brake 
won't be applied to them. But on the other hand, given the 
lineup that we see, they'll have a little less monetarism and a 
little more state planning. That's how I understand the issue. 
  I don't think that Belarus can add 10 percent to the 
inflation rate. We've made some very serious miscalculations, 
or rather calculations, and that kind of inflation... [pauses] 
It's quite another matter that everyone who can will claim that 
such inflation has come about due to unification. So the 
agreements have to be carefully drawn up, and the reason for 
that explained. 
  As far as political unification is concerned, then excuse 
me. 
I'll say once again that I'm proud that Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin, the president of Russia...[pauses] It wasn't even me 
that asked him or pushed him about this. You see, it turned out 
during talks that we both came up with the same proposal. We 
should have made it clear that this is two states reaching 
agreement here, two countries. That we are preparing a 
full-scale and far-reaching treaty on relations between our 
states. But taking into account the realities and the great 
extent to which we are interwoven, this probably won't be the 
kind of agreement that is reached between other states. That 
is, it will be a closer relationship anticipating the kind of 
links, perhaps, of which some countries in Europe dream. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Rudometov] The question of dual citizenship arises. How is 
it being resolved in Belarus, and in this connection there is a 
question from our next group of listeners. 
  [Shushkevich] I can answer that one straight away. 
  [Rudometov] Go ahead, please. 
  [Shushkevich] This question has not been resolved in our 
legislation. It can be decided in two ways: One way is by being 
drawn up by our commission on nationalities, because we have to 
find a way. There is a certain category of people affected, and 
we've understood that this issue has to be resolved. The other 
way might be set out in this treaty. It could be drawn up 
applying international law. Instructions have been issued. 
  [Rudometov] [passage omitted] What measures are being taken 
by the Belarus Government to uphold ensure rights in Belarus 
that are being encroached upon in other ex-USSR republics? This 
question comes from a lady in Riga who didn't give her name. 
  [Shushkevich] Yes, this kind of question could well be 
asked in Riga, because there's a problem there. There's a group 
of servicemen's families who, in our opinion, do not largely 
enjoy all the rights enjoyed by citizens of Latvia. This is a 
delicate issue. Our Supreme Soviet commission is aware of it 
and a whole range of specific approaches to it have been 
examined. It might possibly be resolved with international 
involvement. We have told the Latvians about this and also 
other states who are trying to help Latvia sort this issue out. 
There are families of former servicemen of Belarusian origin in 
Latvia who, our commission on inter-ethnic relations is 
convinced -- I stress is convinced -- do not have the status 
that free citizens of a free country should have. This, 
unfortunately, is a fact. [passage omitted] 
  [Rudometov] Will the promise about early elections to the 
Supreme Soviet be honored, and why is there no law on recalling 
deputies? A lot of people are concerned about this. 
  [Shushkevich] Once again, I repeat that unfortunately the 
Supreme Soviet is so distracted from its proper work by 
secondary issues and investigations it shouldn't be involved in 
that I think we can only meet the announced deadline by 
mobilizing all forces within it. Because the process is clearly 
being drawn out, there's no secret about that. I'm beginning to 
think certain groups of deputies are even doing this 
deliberately. [passage omitted] 
  [Semenov] Viktor Viktorovich Poteskiy from Nizhniy Tagil is 
interested in your attitude toward your Polish minority. 
  [Shushkevich] I don't think that we have a problem with the 
Polish national minority. In particular this is linked to the 
Catholic faith...[pauses] Our legislation and the realities are 
such that Poles have a proper status in Belarus. 
  [Semenov] Regarding your new position on nuclear disarmament 
by Belarus: You're known to have set a good example for 
everyone in this respect, but some nuances have appeared. 
  [Shushkevich] Our position is in no way new. It's as it was, 
as was announced on literally the first day of the Presidium of 
the Supreme Soviet when I was elected chairman. We are for 
withdrawal. We signed all the documents and we are withdrawing 
them. 
  As far as a share of the value of the materials obtained 
from 
the nuclear warheads in our country is concerned, we have an old 
and long-standing agreement with Russia and the United States 
with all our fellow CIS members. 
  [Semenov] Here is a curious question. It is known that 
President Boris Yeltsin, in his meeting with Bill Clinton, gave 
him certain official documents on the Lee Harvey Oswald case, 
who as you know was officially recognized as the man who killed 
President Kennedy. Meanwhile, there was a report that the 
volumes on this case were sent to Minsk, where Oswald once lived 
and was even married. Did you give anything to President 
Clinton, and do you know anything about this dossier? 
  [Shushkevich] Yuliy Aleksandrovich, everything that could be 
done in accordance with our legislation was done previously. We 
are punctual here in our observance of the law. But I, like all 
my colleagues in Minsk, have already said everything I can about 
this, right up to the fact that I personally taught him Russian, 
the man who is believed to be Kennedy's killer. All the 
documents that could be handed over according to the law were 
handed over a long time ago. 
  [Telen] Stanislav Stanislavovich, your position in the 
Supreme Soviet is, unfortunately, somewhat complex. Up to now, 
you've always managed to find some kind of balance and 
equilibrium to work constructively with the Supreme Soviet. On 
what political forces are you now ready to rely within the 
Supreme Soviet, and with whom is it easier for you to find a 
common language? 
  [Shushkevich] You know, I've now become a centrist, 
initially 
spontaneously but now by conviction. This is a lengthy answer 
to your question, because I can say that I can rely on the 
communists as well, because Marx was the greatest free-marketeer 
of them all. I can demonstrate what's primary and what's 
secondary, beginning with Engels's speech at Karl Marx's grave. 
  I'm obliged to rely on the majority who support the 
government, because they're also all claiming to be 
free-marketeers. Therefore, I'm seeking a platform for 
compromise from the standpoint of rational organization of the 
economy, and such a platform can be found. 
  That's why I'm not a member of any political party and do 
not 
intend in the near future to create one. 
  [Telen] One more question. Economic reform is known to be 
proceeding in a less intensive way than many people and 
economists in Belarus would like. Are there any differences in 
this respect between yourself and Prime Minister Kebich? 
  [Shushkevich] You mentioned differences. I want reforms to 
move faster than the prime minister can realistically achieve. 
You see, I want this to happen. We're creating laws on the 
basis of which they can move faster, but it's the prime minister 
who has to do it. And this is where the complications arise. 
It's a lot harder for him -- I understand that -- but I do 
think that in the actual present conditions we can head toward a 
free market faster. [passage omitted] 
  [Semenov] Did you get a saxophone concert during your 
meeting 
with President Clinton? 
  [Shushkevich] No, we didn't get a saxophone concert because 
we didn't have enough time and had to tend to business. We 
didn't have any breaks for a personal chat except in the car. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Semenov] Stanislav Stanislavovich, we have a little time 
left. Perhaps you'd like to speak on something the questions 
didn't touch upon? Go ahead if you wish. 
  [Shushkevich] Esteemed colleagues, I'd like to say one 
thing. 
It's very difficult to reform a simple structure, and very 
difficult to reform the economy of a large state. Naturally, 
difficulties are encountered in the course of such reform. The 
whole trouble is that without completing one phase or one task, 
we start making such a noise about these difficulties and 
cursing the reformers that we sometimes lose sight of the goal. 
  I appeal for calm and persistence, because once you choose 
the type of treatment it's impossible to hand the patient over 
to someone else. That would only kill the patient. You should 
either believe the doctor or not believe him. In our country, 
we have every reason to believe in our Supreme Soviet. But in 
the past week it's badly undermined these reasons because we've 
started occupying ourselves with secondary tasks. 
  I'd say this: We shouldn't be diverted from our planned 
market-economy policy, a policy for a social market economy. I 
stress the social, so that pensioners, veterans, and Chernobyl 
victims understand that we should do everything to look after 
them. But we mustn't be deflected from our course. And the 
Russian prime minister... [pauses] We can see that things have 
got better in Russia because Russia has moved more determinedly 
toward the free market. [passage omitted]

  [Text] One of the key events in the republic's political 
life over the past few days has been the arrest by officers of 
the Lithuanian security service and law enforcement agencies in 
Minsk of the leaders of the Lithuanian Communist Party, N. 
Burokevicius and J. Jermalavicius, who have been living there 
illegally. Today RESPUBLIKA and NARODNAYA GAZETA published a 
commentary from the Belarusian Internal Affairs Ministry on this 
matter. The commentary says the following: 
  "In accordance with the treaty between Belarus and Lithuania 
`On legal aid and legal relations in civil, family, and criminal 
cases' signed in October 1992 and ratified by the Belarusian 
Supreme Soviet in February 1993, the Belarusian side provided 
assistance to a group of Lithuanian law enforcement officers 
headed by a deputy procurator general in detaining citizens N. 
Burokevicius and J. Jermalavicius. Legal grounds for detaining 
and handing over other persons who are not citizens of Lithuania 
are not established, and this was stated to the Lithuanian 
procuracy. The actions by the Belarusian law enforcement 
officers correspond to the afore-mentioned treaty and to 
international legal norms."

  [Text] Eduard Shirkovsky, Chairman of the Belarussian KGB, 
told a closed session of the country's Supreme Soviet that 
Mikolas Burokevicius and Juozas Jermalavicius, leaders of the 
banned Communist Party of Lithuania (CPSU), had been kidnapped 
in Minsk by two Lithuanian policemen with the aid of the 
Belarusian Interior Ministry, not by the Lithuanian security 
service. 
  The KGB chief said that this "act of international 
gangsterism" was possible because the KGB did not control the 
activities of the Interior Ministry. 
  Vladimir Yegorov, the Interior Minister, told parliament 
that 
officers of the Belarusian Interior Ministry detained the two 
men in the presence of two Lithuanian law enforcement officers. 
He said that the Belarusian police did not have a written 
arrest warrant but this action had been discussed by Interior 
Ministry and prosecution officers, in particular by the interior 
minister and the prosecutor general of Belarus. 
  In Yegorov's words, the men involved in the detention 
believed that an arrest warrant did exist, which is why the car 
carrying the Lithuanian special service men and the detainees 
left for the Belarusian-Lithuanian border. 
  Pyotr Kravchenko, Belarusian Foreign Minister, said that his 
ministry had not received any messages that were required by the 
appropriate agreement between Belarus and Lithuania about the 
arrest.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>
  [Text] This morning's session of the Supreme Soviet was 
held behind closed doors. As I have learned, deputies should 
have completed their discussion on the briefings by General 
Attorney Shaladonaw, Interior Minister Yegorov, KGB Chairman 
Shyrkovskiy, Foreign Minister Kravchanka, and Border Troops 
Commander Bacharaw regarding the Lithuanian incident -- the 
detention of Lithuanian communists Burokevicius and 
Jarmalavicius, who were accused of participating in the bloody 
events of 1991. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to listen to 
the debate. Therefore, I have to wait for a recess and hope 
that someone will show courage and relate to me the course of 
the discussion on this issue and its results. 
  The recess has been called, and deputies are currently 
exchanging their opinions on this issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Rutkowski] My interlocutor is People's 
Deputy Aleksandr (Parun). What is your assessment on this 
incident? 
  [(Parun)] As a matter of fact, there has been no incident. 
What has really occurred was fulfillment of bilateral agreements 
signed between the Republic of Belarus and Lithuania. Another 
issue is that, de facto, we lack strong state authority, and due 
to that, the law has been violated at different levels. The 
Attorney General's Office should have issued a warrant to arrest 
the previously mentioned individuals, and it failed to do so, 
giving a verbal order by telephone instead. Second, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, which conducted this operation 
along with representatives of the Lithuanian special services, 
carried out this job without written permission from the 
Attorney General's Office. The reports by the KGB chairman and 
the foreign minister, which were requested by numerous deputies, 
showed that the very lack of strong authority and the lack of a 
system of subordinating these services to state authority is 
leading to various violations of the law. 
  The essential resolution which should be adopted by the 
Supreme Council should concern not only this incident, but also 
other episodes in which the rights of our citizens on 
territories of other republics and citizens of other republics 
on our territory were violated. Everything should be done in a 
manner enabling us to finally establish a strong state authority. 
  [Rutkowski] Is it possible that we will wake up one day and 
there will be different authorities -- power will be assumed by 
a foreigner? 
  [(Parun)] We should know what is going on in our country, 
and we should prevent attempts to violate our Constitution. 
  [Rutkowski] However, the question of what is hidden behind 
this political action still remains unanswered. I have 
addressed this question to People's Deputy Yawhen Huskevich. 
  [Huskevich] In my opinion this is politicizing. The 
campaign against the power structures -- the KGB, the Attorney 
General's Office, and the Interior Ministry -- establishes the 
framework for a coup. I believe so because what has happened 
does not deserve two days of discussion behind closed doors. 
Today, we have fulfilled this duty and heard those reports. 
[end recording] 
  What will be the final result of this story? I believe we 
will find out soon.

  [Text] In an interview granted to Tiraspol television in 
the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party and deputy of the 
State Duma, has made a delirious statement again, throwing 
menacing statements and invectives at an independent and 
sovereign state -- the Republic of Moldova. 
  Here is an excerpt from that interview, which caused 
consternation in Chisinau and not just there: 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording, in Russian with superimposed 
Romanian translation] Send us your request immediately to join 
the ruble zone and that is it! You will have Russian currency, 
all your payments will be made in rubles, and you will not have 
any more problems. That is the sole solution. 
  You are a part of Russia, even if, for the time being, 
Moldova does not want to become a part of Russia. I promise I 
will do it! We will incorporate you within Russia on all planes, 
including the diplomatic, military, financial, and economic 
aspects. 
  I wish you courage and manliness. I understand your 
situation. You are encircled by Moldova and Ukraine. Yours is 
the most difficult situation in the whole of Russia. Look, the 
Russians in Lithuania have Leningrad to support them. However, 
there is no one standing beside you. You represent the most 
heroic part of Russia! I will do everything I can. I will make 
all necessary efforts for you to return to Russia, and we will 
compensate all your losses. Of course, we cannot compensate 
your losses in human lives, but we will compensate them by 
severely punishing all those who are guilty for the crimes 
perpetrated on the soil of the Dniester Republic. We will not 
lie to you and we will not betray you! Never, ever! The 
Dniester Republic shall be a part of Russia! [end recording] 
  In connection with the aforementioned allegations, which 
justify the requests of Zhirinovskiy's many compatriots to begin 
penal investigations against him or send him to a mental 
hospital, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Republic of 
Moldova has issued the following press communique: 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Moldova today sent a note to 
the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Chisinau in connection 
with the interview granted by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to Tiraspol 
television, which was broadcast on 18 January 1994, in which the 
deputy to the Russian Duma formulated territorial claims against 
the Republic of Moldova, saying, among other things, that the 
Dniester Republic should be included in Russia and that the 
[14th] Army will stay there. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry considers such statements made 
by a representative of Russia's law-making body as irresponsible 
and consequently as an attempt made against the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. Such 
statements prejudice Moldovan-Russian relations, create tension 
among the public opinion, and might negatively influence the 
talks on the political settlement of the conflict in the eastern 
rayons [of Moldova] and the withdrawal of the 14th Army from 
Moldova. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Moldova resolutely protests 
and requests that adequate steps be taken to express the clear 
distancing of the competent bodies of the Russian Federation 
from the stance and statements made by Zhirinovskiy, concludes 
the press communique released by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of 
the Republic of Moldova.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspodent Sergey Batyrev] </F>
  [Text] Paris, 21 Jan -- The signing of a treaty on accord, 
friendship and cooperation between France and Georgia and the 
meeting between Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze and 
French President Francois Mitterrand were the most important 
moments of the final day of the Georgian leader's visit to 
France. 
  After a prolonged conversation between the two countries' 
leaders in the Elysee Palace there was a ceremonial signing of 
the French-Georgian treaty, which will create the legal 
framework for the future relations of cooperation between the 
two countries. After this, Eduard Shevardnadze signed on 
Georgia's behalf the Paris Charter for a New Europe - the basic 
document of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, marking the end of the Cold War and proclaiming the 
principle of the settlement of all conflicts by peaceful means. 
  The conclusion of the treaty between France and Georgia 
means 
that we are establishing special relations of cooperation and 
interaction between us, Francois Mitterrand said at the signing 
ceremony. Today Georgia is encountering significant 
difficulties of a political and economic nature, and it can 
count on the solidarity of its friends, the French president 
noted. We face interaction in Europe, which is now being built 
anew, and both our countries bear responsibility for the success 
of this, the French head of state said. 
  The signing of today's documents represents a historic 
moment 
for Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze said in his reply. Today we 
are going through a difficult period, but I believe in Georgia's 
future, and it is linked above all with the fact that we have 
friends in the world, the Georgian leader said. We arrived in 
Paris with great hopes, and I must say that these hopes have 
come true. Today we are opening a new page in the relations 
between our countries, the head of the Republic of Georgia said. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze summed up the initial results of his 
visit to France at a news conference today. The main aims of 
the visit are to establish normal relations with France and 
discuss the most important political problems with its leader, 
and these have been achieved, he said. France, he remarked, has 
promised aid for Georgia in various fields, including by taking 
an active role with Russia, the United States and Germany in the 
work by states friendly to Georgia to find a way of resolving 
the Abkhazia conflict. 
  Georgia is placing particular emphasis on developing 
relations with Russia, Eduard Shevardnadze said. He stressed 
that there are high hopes in his country for the visit to 
Tbilisi by President Yeltsin, scheduled for early February. I 
hope that these hopes are justified, he said. 
  I spent much time with my French counterpart discussing the 
new Russia and its new role in the world, meaning in the 
post-communist period, Eduard Shevardnadze remarked in reply to 
a question from ITAR-TASS. We noted that this role can only be 
performed if Russia takes a democratic path, he commented. We 
believe the adoption of a new Russian constitution to be a 
significant event and attach great importance to the part that 
the country's presidency can play in guaranteeing democracy, the 
Georgian head of state said.

  [Text] [Announcer] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze 
today ended his official visit to France and returned to 
Tbilisi. In his first interview after arrival, Eduard 
Shevardnadze told journalists that realistic ways for a peaceful 
settlement of the crisis had taken shape at the talks between 
Georgia and Abkhazia that are under way in Geneva. 
  [Begin recording] [Shevardnadze] The main aim has been 
achieved, I mean the elaboration of a legal basis for 
cooperation and friendship between the two states [France and 
Georgia]. A large treaty was signed, and the prospects for 
economic relations look good. There was much talk, of course, 
about the state of things in Russia which is our concern and 
worry, too. The world community must support the democratic 
choice made by the whole of Russia and its president. 
  [Correspondent] Touching upon the prospects for relations 
between Georgia, UNESCO, and the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, Eduard Shevardnadze had the 
following to say: 
  [Shevardnadze] This work has just started. The 
status...[pauses] I have visited the headquarters of this 
organization and it seems to me that the prospects here are also 
good. We have agreed that a special delegation will visit (?us) 
and we will sort things out on the spot. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Traditional weekly radio interview given by Eduard </F>
Shevardnadze to correspondent Nato Oniani in Tbilisi on 10 
January] 
  [Excerpts] At the request of correspondent Nato Oniani, 
Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian Parliament-head of 
state, began his traditional radio interview by commenting on 
the speech delivered on Georgian television by Parliament 
Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze. 
  [Shevardnadze] Vakhtang Goguadze's speech should become a 
subject of serious study. I do not think it necessary that the 
establishment of order, if we understand this in its literal 
sense, should be entrusted to Russia. We ourselves should 
establish order in our own country. A country that is unable to 
establish order does not deserve independence and will be unable 
to preserve it. It is a different matter when what is under 
discussion is the resolution of the problem in Abkhazia or 
Samachablo [South Ossetia]; if the establishment of order 
relates to these problems, it will be probably difficult and, in 
practice, impossible to resolve them without the participation 
of Russia. 
  As regards the ruble zone, I believe that no one is ready 
today to convincingly formulate his own views on this question. 
Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Vakhtang was 
expressing one possible variant, namely that Georgia should join 
the ruble zone when other CIS member states have done the 
opposite and have encountered certain difficulties in this 
respect. Apart from Georgia, Belarus is the only country that 
has more or less determined its position regarding entry into 
the ruble zone. 
  It is impossible today to give a decisive answer to this 
question. A country that has its own national currency cannot 
state so easily that it is ready to join the ruble or any other 
zone. I said in my New Year's interview that the introduction 
of the coupon was a mistake; more precisely, it was a premature 
decision taken by the authorities at that time, including me. 
Unfortunately, it transpired that the country, in the shape of 
the Cabinet and Parliament, was not prepared to turn toward 
Russia. If we had turned toward Russia, I am convinced that we 
would have overcome the bank note crisis, we would have received 
the necessary amount, and we would have been seriously prepared 
for the introduction of a national currency. There was a 
greater desire on our part at the time to introduce as quickly 
as possible our national currency as one of the attributes of 
statehood and independence. To tell the truth, both the state 
and individual families paid quite a high price for this. 
  Therefore, I am not ready today to give an answer. I will 
need to have serious consultations with our foreign colleagues. 
I am going to visit Turkey, France, and the United States and 
meet with the heads of the IMF, the World Bank, and certain 
international economic organizations, including the UN, and, 
thereafter, I will be better qualified to give an answer as to 
what the solution is. However, it will be very difficult to find 
one without simultaneous help from some foreign power, be this 
in the form of large credits or other measures. I think that 
two or three months are needed in order to give a specific 
answer to this serious question raised by Batoni Vakhtang. 
  [Oniani] In your New Year interview, you mentioned that 1994 
will be the year of economic revival. Will it also be the year 
of political revival? 
  [Shevardnadze] When I said that 1994 would be the beginning 
of a turnabout in the economy, politics, and, as I put it, state 
thinking in general, naturally I had in mind political events. 
We have to put a stop to talk about someone preparing a coup 
and someone possibly seizing power; there should exist a legal 
way for doing everything and, in any case, the use of weapons 
must be excluded. 
  Batoni Tengiz Kitovani [former defense minister] stated 
recently: I am not planning any kind of coup; those who want to 
divert attention from social problems to some other problems are 
the ones who need to speak about a coup. Batoni Sigua's [former 
prime minister] frequent pronouncements against the authorities, 
in particular the head of state, are well known. However, 
threats of a coup have, as yet, not been heard in his speeches. 
There have been other speeches, but I do not pay very much 
attention to all this. I would like to say the following about 
these two persons: Both Batoni Sigua and Tengiz Kitovani will 
always remain as heroes regarding those events that marked the 
beginning of the expulsion of provincial fascism from Georgia [a 
reference to their role in deposing ex-President Gamsakhurdia in 
January 1992]. This is an historical process and they not only 
participated in this process but also were its leaders and will 
remain so throughout history. As for all the rest, the 
individual pronouncements and speeches, and Sigua's plans that 
he is frequently outlining and speaking about in Parliament or 
on television, I think this should be explained as human 
weakness, annoyance, anger, a lack of objectivity and knowledge, 
and, at times, something else. I repeat that all this is a 
detail; the most important thing is their service to this 
serious and historic matter. 
  I do not think that 1994 will be a year of any very great 
political cataclysms; I do not think that we should expect any 
coups and so forth as this naturally will not bring society 
anything. 
  [Oniani] To what extent are the second stage of the state 
of emergency and the curfew adopted by Parliament being 
implemented in Georgia today? 
  [Shevardnadze] I will not be exaggerating if I say that we 
are doing everything it is possible to do in such a short period 
of time following the conclusion of events in western Georgia, 
and this is being felt little by little in the country. Order 
is being restored along the highways in western Georgia, and the 
situation there is being controlled by the police as it is along 
the highway leading to the Jvari Gorge and in certain other 
directions. Order is being restored at the oil wells and fuel 
depots. Unfortunately, we needed to use internal troops there. 
In the main, order has now been restored at these 
installations. This means that, in the near future, we will be 
able to produce 200,000-300,000 tonnes of oil. Order has been 
established in Zestafoni; the operation conducted by the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs involving the participation of 
hundreds of men and a large amount of equipment is well known. 
Order has been restored in Mtskheta rayon where a fairly 
dangerous group has been isolated. [passage omitted] 
  Finally, for three days now, a very big operation has been 
underway in Kvemo Kartli where the situation has been 
unbearable. I was receiving numerous telegrams daily; I don't 
know how many delegations arrived here; I myself visited these 
rayons and met with many people. I have to say that such a 
thing cannot go on in a normal country. Up to 1,500 men have 
taken part in this operation, mainly Ministry of Internal 
Affairs internal troops who have received assistance from the 
Ministry of Security; individual subunits from the Ministry of 
Defense have also taken part in it. As far as I know, the 
results have been fairly good and convincing. These measures are 
continuing. The main thing is that, following the establishment 
of stability in western Georgia, we have been given the chance 
to get on with restoring order in all rayons. 
  I think the time has come to get more actively involved in 
establishing order in the capital and Rustavi where there are 
very many armed formations, both legal and illegal. I believe 
that the dreadful firing that occurred on New Year's Eve did not 
come only from illegal weapons. I am convinced that we probably 
need one month to take care of the capital and Rustavi. In 
Rustavi, there are several unregistered armed formations. If 
they are listening to me now, I advise them to come to Tbilisi 
tomorrow or join the state structure, or put down their weapons 
and start living a normal life. Otherwise, things will end 
badly. They should take this as a serious warning from me. I 
know that they fought where it was necessary but, no matter what 
occurred in the past, the law exists and this has to be obeyed 
by everyone. 
  [SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA editorial note] At the constituent 
congress of the Abkhazian regional organization of the Union of 
Georgia's Citizens, the statutes read by the head of state had 
an optimistic ring about them. This gave rise to the following 
question: 
  [Oniani] Is the deepening of relations with Russia the 
reason for this optimism? 
  [Shevardnadze] One of the reasons is undoubtedly the 
deepening of relations with Russia and with the CIS member 
states in general since our turning toward them means, first and 
foremost, the revival of economic life and the restoration of 
economic ties. This process has already begun and it is a very 
hopeful one. I am convinced that the first half of this year 
will be a period during which very intensive negotiations will 
be conducted with various associations, departments, different 
republics, oblasts, and corresponding administrations. However, 
I think that the second half of the year will be a completely 
new stage in the economic life of Georgia; a new stage from the 
point of view that people will begin to work more intensively 
and on a large scale. I hope that the foreign firms that are 
coming here to carry out work on oil extraction have definite 
expectations and, God willing, we will find a little more oil in 
Georgia. There are also other resources, in particular our coal 
and certain other alternative sources of energy, which will 
enable us to be more prepared for next winter. Winter should 
not mean an economic freeze or the economy coming to a halt. 
Hence, I repeat that the deepening of relations with Russia 
itself and our joining the CIS means, first and foremost, the 
revival of the economy and I think that, if the economy gets 
going again and in an effective manner, people will have a 
better life. 
  There is no disputing the fact that we have to return to 
Abkhazia. How this should be done is another question. Another 
meeting is taking place in Geneva. There are definite hopes 
that the meeting will bring results and, if not, it doesn't 
matter; our return is inevitable. Furthermore, the view exists 
that our return to Abkhazia is connected with the more 
progressive and just position assumed by Russia. At the same 
time, events focused on Georgia that are taking place not only 
in Russia but also throughout the world, in particular, the 
creation of organizations and committees in support of us in 
various countries, more assistance, investments in the national 
economy, and humanitarian aid, are also important. However, the 
main thing is order. If there is order, there will be 
investment and the flow of capital from different countries 
throughout the world and, in this way, the country will be 
saved. This is what I meant when I said that 1994 should be a 
turning point. 
  [SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA editorial note] The head of state 
had the following to say about the news of the death of the 
former president that was spread last week: 
  [Shevardnadze] The death of any person arouses serious 
regret in me, particularly as the ex-president no longer 
represented any kind of serious political force in Georgia today 
following those events that took place in western Georgia. His 
ideology, his world outlook, and his supporters were defeated in 
every way and from all points of view in accordance with all 
existing laws. 
  Regarding those forces that were connected in one way or 
another with provincial fascism, I do not think that we have the 
right to feel at peace. Of course, Gamsakhurdia was not alone. 
He was a politician who adhered to the most categorical and 
forward positions. However, he had supporters not only at the 
time when, as we now say, the national-liberation movement 
embraced the whole of Georgia but also later when he was moving 
on Kutaisi and Tbilisi; there were people in many political 
parties that were ready to form an alliance with him. If it is 
possible to make some kind of forecast, it should be said that 
these forces will try to create a new organization that is not 
so much radical but, nevertheless, neo-fascist or profascist in 
its orientation and if they succeed and come to power, they will 
conduct the same policies that were implemented by Gamsakhurdia. 
Therefore, we have to be careful and vigilant. 
  I do not know whether anyone has witnessed Gamsakhurdia's 
burial and we do not know where his grave is. The area in which 
it is supposed to be is, so we are told, still under the control 
of a small group of his supporters who are quite well armed. We 
do not want there to be any kind of bloodshed and, therefore, we 
are not moving in there. It has been confirmed in Groznyy that 
he indeed committed suicide. According to information brought 
by our delegation, he wife says the same thing. There is now a 
very big debate going on regarding where he should be buried or 
laid to rest. In my view, his family should decide this 
question. If, as I am being told, it is the wish of his family 
that he be definitely buried in Groznyy -- he found refuge there 
and this will be no misfortune -- we will not oppose this. If 
his family should want his grave to be in Georgia, this is also 
up to them. One thing, however, is essential: A serious 
examination of the body should be carried out with the 
participation of international experts so that all other 
versions [of his death] can be either excluded or confirmed. 
Some people are saying that he did not commit suicide, that 
certain forces close to him decided that he was no longer needed 
for anything and, as they say, settled scores with him. Perhaps 
this is gossip, perhaps it's the truth. Therefore, a legal 
medical examination should, in any case, be carried out. This 
is my view. 
  [Oniani] Today, fascism has become a serious force in 
Russia. It therefore seems paradoxical that Georgia is taking a 
serious step toward Russia precisely now.... 
  [Shevardnadze] The expression of a special solidarity with 
President Yeltsin was felt at the meeting in Ashgabat. I think 
this was precisely because there was such a real danger of 
fascism appearing on the large political arena and not only 
Georgia but also all the CIS member states specifically want and 
have to adopt the decision to help Russia's democratic forces in 
the struggle to overcome this terrible sickness. I believe that 
the same feeling exists in the West, in particular in the US 
Administration and Europe's leading and non-leading nations that 
believe that Russia's democracy needs help. If Russia's 
democracy is saved -- I believe this is how the question should 
be put: Will it be saved or not? -- then life on our planet 
will become stable and assume a normal character. So, Russia's 
internal problems are now no longer its problems alone but the 
concern of the whole world. Naturally, Georgia cannot play a 
decisive role but it can make a specific contribution to this 
matter by expressing its support for Russia's democratic forces 
and democratic administration, in particular for President 
Yeltsin. We have been doing this for a long time and we 
continue to hold this position. [passage omitted]

Procurator's Office: "Georgia-Armenia: A Treaty Has Been Drawn 
Up"] 
  [Text] A treaty on mutual legal assistance has been signed 
in Tbilisi and Yerevan between the procurator's offices of the 
Republics of Georgia and Armenia. 
  "This treaty has particular importance for both sovereign 
countries," stated Jamlet Babilashvili, Republic of Georgia 
acting procurator general. "It will promote the joint efforts 
of the law enforcement bodies of the neighboring states in the 
struggle against organized crime, in particular terrorism, the 
narcotics business, and so forth; it will contribute to the 
successful fulfillment of supervisory functions connected with 
investigations, the arrest and transfer of criminals, and the 
resolution of other important questions." 
  Armenia is the seventh country with whose procurator's 
office 
Georgia's Procurator's Office has drawn up a treaty. Such 
treaties have been concluded with the Russian Federation, 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and other republics. 
Treaties are being prepared with the procurator's offices of 
Turkey, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Afghanistan and they 
will soon become official. In short, Georgia's Procurator's 
Office is gaining international recognition on a broad scale.

  [Text] United Nations Organisation January 22 TASS -- 
Georgia and Abkhazia are urging the deployment of the U.N. 
peace-keeping force in the conflict zone and are expressing 
their "mutual desire that the Russian military contingent should 
be included in it," says a communique on the results of the 
second round of the Geneva talks about the settlement of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, which was circulated here on Friday 
as a document of the Security Council. 
  According to the communique, "the sides will withdraw all 
armed units with arms and military hardware from the Inguri 
river and other possible lines of active confrontation within 
five days after the arrival of the peace-keeping force.... At 
the same time, international observers and peace-keeping troops 
will move into the areas from which armed units are withdrawn." 
  The communique pointed out that both the Georgian and 
Abkhazian sides "have recognised that the main task is to 
achieve a full-scale political settlement of the conflict, and 
all efforts should be concentrated on attaining this goal." 
They agreed to continue the discussion of the problem of 
Abkhazia's political status, taking into account the interests 
of both sides. The next meeting of experts on this issue will 
be held in Moscow on February 8. 
  Following the adoption of the Geneva communique, Georgia 
asked to convene the Security Council for discussing a 
possibility of sending a U.N. peace-keeping force to the area of 
the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.

  [Text] The chairman of Abkhazia's parliament, Vladislav 
Ardzinba, has said that "the normal return of refugees can 
hardly begin before the issue of deploying international 
peace-keeping forces on the border between Georgia and Abkhazia 
is resolved, because peace-keepers alone can guarantee lasting 
peace in Abkhazia". 
  The U.N. Security Council must make the final decision as 
far 
as the possibility of deploying peace-keeping forces is 
concerned, Ardzinba said in an interview with Abkhazian 
television Saturday evening. 
  Participants in the Georgian-Abkhazian talks held in Geneva 
on January 11-13 called for stationing Russian troops as 
peace-keepers on the border River Inguri. 
  Abkhazian frontier troops must be deployed on the border 
alongside of the peace-keeping forces, Ardzinba said. As for 
Abkhazia's armed forces, their units, he noted, will be 
stationed in Gali District "behind international peace-keeping 
forces". 
  Before the issue of deploying peace-keeping forces is 
settled 
"Abkhazia must strengthen its army and be ready to protect its 
territory", Ardzinba pointed out. 
  With reference to the return of refugees to Abkhazia, the 
Abkhaz leader said that this will relate primarily to the 
inhabitants of Gali District. According to him, the Abkhaz 
authorities will have individual approaches to everyone who 
wants to return to Abkhazia. "Those with blood on their hands 
can hardly expect to get back to Abkhazia," he declared.

  [Text] Leader of the Liberation of Abkhazia pressure group 
Boris Kakubava says that a military option is the only way of 
ensuring the return of refugees to Abkhazia. 
  In an interview with Interfax news agency on Sunday, he gave 
a highly negative response to the outcome of the Geneva talks 
between Georgia and Abkhazia including the problem of Georgian 
refugees. In his view, Russia cannot act as mediator because of 
Moscow's role in the conflict leading to the loss of Abkhazia. 
  Chairman of the national security and defence commission 
Nodar Natadze was likewise sceptical about the Geneva talks. 
The deployment of Russian troops along the Inguri river 
separating Georgia and Abkhazia as asked by the negotiating 
teams will prevent Georgians from crossing it and turn 
Abkhazia's Georgian population into slaves or hostages, he told 
Interfax. 
  Natadze says, "if Russia is really keen to see Georgia as a 
stable and integral state, it ought to deploy troops not along 
the Inguri but Psou river on Russia's border with Abkhazia".

<F P=106> ["Directive of the Georgian Head of State on the State </F>
Commission for Legal Reform" issued in Tbilisi on 26 December] 
  [Text] The construction of a Georgian democratic and legal 
state, the protection of human rights and freedoms, the 
development of a free economy, and the implementation of justice 
are essentially dependent upon the elaboration of legislative 
acts that will regulate anew the most important social relations 
taking into account contemporary legal thinking, the 
achievements of legal practice in developed countries, and 
national traditions. 
  In recent years, the Georgian Parliament commissions, state 
bodies, and scientific establishments have not prepared a single 
legislative act that has been of vital importance for the 
political, economic, and social development of the country. At 
the same time, legislative activity is lagging behind the 
demands of contemporary life; many spheres of social relations 
are being regulated in accordance with old legal norms 
pertaining to other social and political systems; the 
development of new social relations is being hindered by the 
corresponding legal disorder; new civil, criminal, labor, 
administrative, and prison codes and a code of civil procedure 
should be elaborated without which the systematic development of 
current legislation is impossible. It is necessary to organize 
anew the protection of the law, investigations, the Procurator's 
Office, and the courts and the principles governing these 
activities. 
  Proceeding from this: 
  1. With the aim of preparing draft basic legislative acts, 
codes, and other acts in the fundamental branches of the law, a 
state commission on legal reform is to be created that will be 
attached to the Republic of Georgia Ministry of Justice. It 
will be composed of the following persons: 
  Tevdore Ninidze -- Republic of Georgia Minister of 
Justice (commission chairman); 
  Mindia Ugrekhelidze -- chairman of the Republic 
of Georgia Supreme Court (cochairman); 
  Jamlet Bibiliashvili -- acting Republic of Georgia 
procurator general (cochairman); 
  Shota Kviria -- Republic of Georgia minister of 
internal affairs (cochairman); 
  Igor Giorgadze -- Republic of Georgia minister of 
security (cochairman); 
  Tengiz Liluashvili -- director of the Academy of 
Sciences State and Law Institute (cochairman, chairman of the 
Commission for Legislation on Civil Procedure); 
  Sergo Jorbenadze -- holder of the chair of civil 
law and civil procedure in the Law Faculty at Tbilisi State 
University (chairman of the Commission for Civil Legislation); 
  Giorgi Tqeshelidze -- holder of the chair of 
criminal law in the Law Faculty at Tbilisi State University 
(chairman of the Commission for Legislation on Criminal Law); 
  Iakob Putkaradze -- head of the Department of 
State and International Law at the Georgian Academy of Sciences 
State and Law Institute (chairman of the Commission for 
Constitutional Legislation); 
  Apolon Paliashvili -- holder of the chair of 
justice and supervision by the Procurator's Office at Tbilisi 
State University (chairman of the Commission for Legislation on 
Criminal Procedure); 
  Valeri Loria -- holder of the chair of the 
principles of the law and legal education at Tbilisi State 
University (chairman of the Commission for Administrative 
Legislation); 
  Gia Meparishvilvi -- associate professor in the 
Law Faculty at Tbilisi State University (chairman of the 
Commission for the Organization of Activities To Protect the 
Law); 
  Lado Chanturia -- associate professor in the Law 
Faculty at Tbilisi State University (chairman of the Commission 
for Agrarian Legislation); 
  Roland Giligashvili -- Republic of Georgia deputy 
procurator general (chairman of the Commission for Prison 
Legislation). 
  2. The statutes of the State Commission for Legal Reform, 
the composition of branch commissions, and the plan for 
preparing draft legislative acts are to be approved by the 
chairman of the state commission. 
  3. The Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers is to 
approve the composition and [budget] estimate of the State 
Commission for Legal Reform on the basis of proposals submitted 
by the chairman of the State Commission for Legal Reform. 
  4. The working period of the State Commission for Legal 
Reform is to be 1994-95. 
  5. The State Commission for Legal Reform is to deliver 
periodically a report on the work it has carried out to the 
Georgian head of state.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 22 TASS -- Chechen President 
Dzhokhar Dudayev said plans have been made to bury Georgian 
ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia in Groznyy. 
  In an exclusive interview with the World Television News 
Company obtained by ITAR-TASS by its courtesy, Dudayev said "we 
plan to bury Zviad Gamsakhurdia in Groznyy, on the square of the 
memorial complex which is being built to commemorate the 
beginning of the deportation of the Chechen people (celebrated 
in the republic annually on February 23). This will do honour 
to all Chechen people." 
  A Georgian delegation which returned to Tbilisi last night 
had held talks in Groznyy on Gamsakhurdia's re-burial. The 
delegation included relatives of the late president, scientists 
and representatives of the georgian public prosecutor's office. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt from one of the members of the delegation 
that in Groznyy Gamsakhurdia's relatives met with his wife 
Manana.

<F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Council Deputy Guram Petriashvili, </F>
by Roman Koval, reporter for the State Independence of Ukraine 
press service; place and date not given: "Empires Turn to Dust, 
But Nations Live On"] 
  [Text] [Koval] Mr. Guram, there are different versions 
regarding unbelievable developments in the Mengreli village of 
Djikhaskari on New Year's eve. What happened to Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia? Is he dead or alive? If he is dead, what were the 
circumstances of his death? 
  [Petriashvili] Just like many other Georgians I do not 
believe in the death of our president. However, if the reports 
are true, I am sure that Gamsakhurdia was murdered -- such 
outstanding people do not commit suicide. Gamsakhurdia has the 
character of a warrior bound by ties of blood with his nation. 
  [Koval] It has become evident that an active redistribution 
of the spheres of influence is under way in the world. 
Undercover diplomacy is becoming a driving force of the new 
world order and some nations make decisions regarding the fate 
of other nations. Do you share these views? 
  [Petriashvili] It is clear now that a scheme has been 
designed in world politics: The United Nations and other 
influential organizations led by the United States have made a 
secret deal with Russia. Its provisions stipulate that Russia 
will have no claims on the so-called socialist camp in East 
Europe and the Baltics. In exchange for this, Western states 
will support Russian attempts to preserve control over all other 
republics and to save the diminished empire. 
  Having consent from the world's influential political forces 
Moscow inspired a coup in Tbilisi and brought KGB General E. 
Shevardnadze to power. Why is the "democratic world community" 
threatening Ukraine and pushing it toward giving up its nuclear 
arms for Russia's advantage? This is another component of the 
same criminal plot against former Soviet nations. 
  [Koval] Can we believe Western mass media claiming that 
Shevardnadze arrived in Georgia to fight Gamsakhurdia's 
"totalitarian regime" and to build a democratic Georgia? 
  [Petriashvili] "Gamsakhurdia's totalitarian regime" is a 
myth invented by the KGB and blown up by those political forces 
of the world that participate in the plot. "World democracies" 
are not satisfied with Gamsakhurdia's desire to win genuine and 
not token CIS-type, independence for Georgia. When in 1991, 
Moscow came forward with an initiative to sign the new Union 
Treaty, the Georgian president categorically refused. The U.S. 
President's reaction was very ambiguous: "Zviad Gamsakhurdia is 
swimming against the stream." 
  With regard to Shevardnadze, it is no secret that this 
imperial secret service general has only one goal, namely to 
subordinate Georgia to Russia again. Even those who once fought 
against legally elected President Gamsakhurdia have realized 
this. A member of Shevardnadze's "legislature" Vazha Adamia 
points out: "Shevardnadze was sent to Georgia on a secret 
mission." Tengiz Sigua, one of the leaders of the Georgian 
putsch agrees: "Shevardnadze has been destroying the Georgian 
economy on purpose so as to make CIS membership the only way to 
save the situation." 
  The myth of Shevardnadze being a freedom-fighter was 
invented 
by those who want the Russian Empire's humble slave to be 
Georgia's leader. 
  Lawlessness reigning in Georgia since the ousting of the 
legal power makes the purges of 1937 look like innocent 
children's games. People who have not seen Georgia for the last 
two years may find witnesses' testimonies exaggerated and 
fantastic. Executions without investigations and trials, 
kidnapping, and robberies represent Georgia's "democracy" of 
today. 
  If someone disregards the people's choice demonstrated in 
the 
general elections he will hardly lead the nation to democracy 
and happiness. Those who come to power by means of violence can 
only bring bloodshed and suffering. History testifies to this. 
  Shevardnadze has always been and remains a Bolshevik 
regardless of his speculations about democracy. Commenting on 
establishing the Georgian Security Ministry he said: "The 
ministry's primary task will be to fight zviadists" (in fact he 
meant dissidents). 
  [Koval] How will the events in Georgia develop in 1994? 
  [Petriashvili] I do not want to give forecasts, but this 
much I am sure of: No matter what happens, the Georgian people 
will not give up their fight for independence. No Lenins, 
Stalins, or Shevardnadzes can bar the movement of Georgians and 
other nations of the Russian empire toward freedom. Empires 
turn to dust, but nations live on.

<F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Smirnov: "Regulating Russian-Georgian </F>
Trade. New Georgiyevsk Treaty in Pipeline"] 
  [Text] To stop Georgia's slide toward economic collapse is 
now possible only on condition of restored traditional economic 
links with Russia. The first step in this direction was 
Georgia's entry into the CIS last fall. In the meeting between 
Russian and Georgian Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
Otar Patsatsiya, KOMMERSANT- DAILY reported yesterday, concrete 
mechanics for the republic to join the Commonwealth were 
discussed, and a number of bilateral agreements including one to 
establish a free-trade regime were approved. 
  Georgia's desire for close economic relations with Russia 
stems from the crisis in the national economy, which is on the 
brink of collapse. In the estimate of the International 
"Reforma" fund, Georgia's state budget deficit in 1993 came 
close to 100 percent. Its debt to Russia tops 50 billion rubles 
[R], and the prospects for paying it are rather nebulous because 
Georgian exports to Russia were constantly falling, and in 1993 
did not exceed R26 billion. This is in parallel with the 
devaluation of the Georgian coupon, whose rate against the ruble 
has fallen since last August by a factor of more than 100. The 
situation is being made even worse by an appreciable decline of 
supplies from Russia, primarily of energy. Deliveries of Russian 
natural gas were stopped as early as 1992, and after the 
Georgian side had been discovered illegally re-exporting Russian 
petroleum products (Russian raw material worth $23.1 million was 
shipped to France alone in the second part of 1992), the Russian 
side sharply cut back its oil and petroleum products supplies. 
  Georgia hopes to stabilize the economic situation by signing 
bilateral agreements with Russia on trade and economic relations 
in 1994, and on a free-trade regime. Under these 
understandings, Georgia will be guaranteed supplies of Russian 
energy in agreed amounts while Georgian goods for Russia will be 
exempt from import duties. The latest meeting of the two 
countries' premiers in Moscow finalized 3 and 4 February as the 
dates of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. The above agreements 
will be signed during this trip. Besides, Eduard Shevardnadze is 
going to bring Georgia back into the ruble zone. The advantages 
for the Georgian side are apparent. As for the ruble, it will 
further weaken as a result of such an alliance. On the whole, 
Georgia is counting on Russia's financial and economic support 
in solving its own national problems. 
  [Saneblidze]Of course. 
  [Lominadze] It is difficult but absolutely necessary and it 
has to be done through systematic and purposeful propaganda and 
actions and not, as some leaders imagine, by thinking that, 
having entered these places, there is nothing else for us to do 
but sit idly by and wait for the results. 
  This was precisely the mood when we entered Abkhazia. Yes, 
we did get from the Inguri River to Sukhumi! However, we did 
not advance further. It is well known what the consequences of 
this were for us. The same thing could possibly happen here as 
well. 
  There was no hand-to-hand combat in Senaki or Khobi or 
Zugdidi or anywhere else. However, although those armed people 
have dispersed, they still exist, do they not? Of course they 
do. Who can guarantee to us that they will not unite again or 
will not use those socioeconomic problems that exist in reality 
for their own purposes? No one. 
  Finally, there is a trend toward an improvement of the 
situation. However, we must not relax our efforts for a single 
moment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Armenian units launched a large scale attack in the 
north of Karabakh on the town of Ter-Ter Thursday evening, a 
spokesman for the Azeri Defense Ministry told Interfax. The 
attacking force of about 2000 troops and nearly ten tanks 
continued the attack on Friday morning. 
  According to the ministry, the Karabakh units succeeded in 
advancing several kilometers towards Ter-Ter but the offensive 
was fended off in the early hours of January 21. In some areas 
the enemy had to retreat beyond the line of departure. 
  According to Baku reports, numerous villages in the Kazakh 
and Tauz districts of Azerbaijan were shelled from Armenia. 
There were civilian casualties. 
  The Karabakh army communique has not been available to 
Interfax.

  [Text] Baku, January 18 (TURAN)--According to the sources 
close to Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan, Armenian Defense 
Ministry ordered its Armed Forces located in Karabakh to use war 
gas against Azeri Army. 
  Armenia has already sent necessary chemical war gas to 
Dzhebrailskiy and Beylagan regions (southern part of front). 
Late December 1993 a specially trained group arrived from 
Armenia to Karabakh to get the chemical weapons ready for 
application. 
  On December 30 Armenian forces have already put chemical gas 
war into practice in the place of Gural-tepe of Beylagan region 
of Azerbaijan. As a result of examination of ground and shell- 
splinters, chemical laboratory under Civil Defense of Republic 
found chemical war gas "cyanide". 
  Military experts think that it is prohibited to apply this 
type of chemical gas war in military activities as they are 
weapons of mass annihilation.

  [Text] On January 23, an Azerbaijani war plane was shot 
down by Karabakh forces not far from Stepanakert, the Karabakh 
defense army's press service informed Interfax. 
  This occurred when two Azerbaijani planes were preparing for 
a bomb attack on the city. Neither the type of the plane, nor 
the fate of the pilot are known yet. 
  The same source also announced that Karabakh units had 
rebuffed all of the Azerbaijani attacks last Sunday in the 
Mardakert, Askeran, Agdam and Gadrut-Fizuli directions. 
Thirty-three Azerbaijani and 2 Karabakh soldiers were killed 
and 6 Karabakh fighters were wounded. 
  The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reports that the 
Azerbaijani 
forces established control over 12 villages last week in 
Azerbaijan's Kelbadzhar region, earlier occupied by Armenian 
formations. In addition, Azerbaijani units forced Armenian 
forces off the Kelbadzhar-Lachin and Kelbadzhar-Mardakert roads. 
  The source asserts that during combat operations last week, 
about 300 Armenian fighters were killed or wounded, and that 14 
Armenian tanks, 5 armored vehicles and 5 artillery pieces were 
destroyed. Four Armenian tanks and 2 armored vehicles were 
captured. 
  The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reports that according to 
Armenian POWs, servicemen of the Russian division located in

  [Text] Baku, January, 22 (AZERTAC) -- According to the 
press service of the Defence Ministry of Azerbaijan another 
Armenian attempt to attack Goradiz, which is situated in the 
south-west of Azerbaijan, has been repulsed by the Azeri armed 
forces. The enemy, who undertook an onslaught in the directions 
of Ter-Ter and Fizuli- Beylagan has been eager to set up control 
over railways of Goradiz in order to prevent Azerbaijan to 
provide food stuffs and fuel to the blockaded Nakhichevan. 
  According to the information available, in several sectors 
of 
the front the Azeri armed forces could repulse the enemy from 
the earlier occupied territory and take more advantageous 
positions. The Defence Ministry of Azerbaijan considers that the 
recent failures of Armenians forced them to spread rumours about 
firing, which has ostensibly taken place between the units of 
the Azeri army.

<F P=106> ["Text" of Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense Communique of 23 </F>
January] 
  [Text] The struggle waged by the Republic's people and 
military forces to liberate the territories occupied by the 
Armenian occupationists is strengthening every day. Responding 
to President Geydar Aliyev's call to the Republic's people, the 
Azerbaijan National Army [ANA] has inflicted effective blows on 
the enemy units and forced them to abandon many of their 
positions and flee from several towns they occupied in 
Fizulinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy Rayons. 
  The troops of our military units, which have significant 
responsibility to the people in safeguarding Azerbaijan's 
territorial integrity, have displayed significant heroism in 
clashes with the ferocious enemy. Regardless of the resistance 
put up by Armenian occupationists, the blows the ANA units have 
inflicted on the enemy [words indistinct]. In fact, they are 
now more determined in their advance against the enemy units. 
The occupationists are becoming more and more aware of the fact 
that they are gradually being defeated in a foreign land. 
  The Armenian Armed Forces, which have lost many men and much 
military equipment and which have realized that they will not 
remain unpunished for the acts of violence they have committed 
in Azerbaijan's territory, are retreating in a disorderly way. 
Kozly, [place-name indistinct], Kabakchylar, Sarnichlar, 
[place-name indistinct], Susuzlu, [four place-names indistinct], 
Kamishly, and Bagyrly in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon were liberated 
from the occupationists as a result of ANA's successful 
operations during the past few days. 
  The ANA units captured several strategically important 
heights, including [place-name indistinct], in the violent 
clashes that took place in that rayon. Consequently, they have 
placed the upper section of the Kelbadzhar-Agdere motorway and 
the section of the Kelbadzhar-Lachin motorway up to [place-name 
indistinct] under their control. 
  The enemy units lost many men and much military equipment in 
the clashes that took place in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon during the 
past week. They lost some 300 officers and men, nine tanks, two 
PDM's [not further identified], and five artillery guns. 
Azerbaijan's military units seized four tanks, two PDM's, a 
large quantity of infantry arms, mortars, and arms depots as 
spoils of war. 
  According to information from [words indistinct], the number 
of deserters has increased eight-fold. The deserters are trying 
to flee to Armenia. Five Armenian officers and men taken as 
prisoners of war have said that they are affiliated with the 
117th Division of Russia's 7th Army. The information they have 
revealed indicates that morale among the troops in Khankendi 
[Stepanakert] is very low. Yerevan has recently prepared to 
dispatch fuel, construction materials, and 20 military vehicles 
to Khankendi. People are taken from their homes in Yerevan and 
sent to the front lines. The prisoners also revealed that they 
joined the fighting because they feared serious repercussions 
against their families. 
  This confirms the fact that Armenian military forces 
supported by Russian military sub-units in Armenia, and not the 
Nagorno-Karabakh self-defense forces as claimed by the Armenian 
and Russian mass media organs, are fighting in Azerbaijan, 
  The ANA units, which are cared for by their state and 
people, 
are becoming more and more steadfast every day. The people of 
the liberated towns can return to their homes. Azerbaijan's 
people must rest assured that the aggressor will be forced to 
retreat and our homeland will be liberated.

<F P=106> [Report by Sokhbet Mamedov: "Having Sent `Iron Lady' to New </F>
York, Geydar Aliyev Forms His Team"] 
  [Text] Baku -- Lola Gadzhiyeva, who aspired to the role of 
Azerbaijan's "Iron Lady" and who was until recently considered 
one of President Aliyev's closest associates, has been suddenly 
removed from her post of republic secretary of state and 
appointed Azerbaijan's permanent representative to the United 
Nations. She was number two in the republic. 
  But her unexpected decision last November to leave the "New 
Azerbaijan" party, whose chairman is Aliyev, and found her own, 
liberal democratic, party, was a sure sign of the divergence of 
positions among the president's inner circle. And this is the 
result -- Gadzhiyeva is on her way to New York, while 
parliamentary speaker Rasul Guliyev moves into second place in 
the republic's political hierarchy. 
  Among the numerous contenders for the vacant post of 
secretary of state people are mentioning the names of Gasan 
Gasanov, the republic's current foreign minister, Ramiz Rizayev, 
Azerbaijani ambassador to Moscow, and Arif Ragimzad, adviser on 
territorial administration. Most observers are inclined to 
think that the president will settle on Gasanov as his choice 
and that the new secretary of state's sphere of activity will be 
limited to foreign policy. 
  The Azerbaijani president has set about forming his team in 
earnest. "I did not have one when I returned to Baku," Aliyev 
admitted to IZVESTIYA's correspondent. "The first appointments 
were made merely with the aim of preventing a total collapse of 
leadership at local level. My aim is to attract capable and 
talented young people into governing the republic."

  [Text] Baku, January 22 (TURAN) -- State Oil Company of 
Azerbaijan [SOCAR] and an American Pennzoil company signed an 
extra agreement on the project of utilization of gas at "Neft 
Dashlari" and "Gunashli". 
  Representative of Pennzoil told TURAN's reporter that the 
extra agreement enlarges and specifies the previous agreement, 
signed in October of the year 1992. 
  The sides agreed to sign an extra agreement, as the previous 
agreement envisaged only the shipment of equipment totalling 90 
million dollars. As soon as Pennzoil began working here a 
number of problems appeared -- the pipe plant, barge-pipelayer, 
and auxiliary ships cannot be used for laying an undersea 
pipeline as they are in emergency condition and need serious 
repair. Then Azerbaijani side asked to increased the power of 
compressors from 3 up to 4.3 million cubic meters per day, carry 
out mounting-construction works and to train Azeri personnel. 
The volume of expenses increased and reached more then 100 
million dollars. 
  According to the extra agreement the SOCAR may pay for the 
project differently: in hard currency, oil and oil products, 
and on the account of Pennzoil's bonus share in the project of 
exploration of "Azeri " and "Chirag" oil fields. 
  "The agreement states that the payment will be the most 
acceptable for Azerbaijan, SOCAR's representative told TURAN's 
reporter. 
  Representative of Pennzoil company said, that the work over 
the project is to end soon, as it is ready for 90 percent by now. 
  The SOCAR counts that the shipment of gas to the shore will 
start in the second quarter of 1994. A construction of a big 
compressor station at "Neft Dashlari" oil field is nearly to 
end, the laying of the pipeline is planned for late March. 
  As the specialists consider the implementation of the 
project 
will put an end to the escape of about 1.8 billion cubic meters 
of gas per year from "Guneshli" oil field.

  [Text] Kazan January 21 TASS -- "There were and there are 
no problems between the Russian and Tatar interior ministries," 
Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin told a news conference in 
Kazan on Friday. All efforts by national extremists to drive a 
wedge between Russia and Tatarstan are in vain, the minister 
added. 
  In the minister's opinion, everything should be done in a 
civilised way. A government decision between Russia and 
Tatarstan is being drafted now. It will define ways of 
delegating powers. 
  All this is being made to reform the Russian Interior 
Ministry. The first move has been made: The role of city and 
district militia departments was increased. Their powers were 
enlarged. 
  These departments were granted additional rights and, 
consequently, their duties were increased. Functions which city 
and district departments are unable to fulfill, are delegated to 
regional departments or the Interior Ministry. The entire 
ministry will be remade on such principles. 
  Yerin noted that he gave a news conference on last year's 
results for the first time. Although the crime situation 
remains difficult, there are some positive changes. Crime rate 
rose by 1.4 per cent over the past year, while in 1992 it was 24 
per cent. 
  The rate of crime exposure is at the level of 50.6 per cent 
and for serious crimes -- 55.6 per cent. 
  The situation in Tatarstan is much better, the minister 
stressed. The general rate of crime exposure here is 60 per 
cent. The minister attributed this to special crime control 
measures taken by the republic for the second year running. 
  These measures should be thoroughly studied, the minister 
noted. In Yerin's opinion, Tatarstan outstripped Russian law 
enforcement bodies in taking initiatives in the sphere of crime 
control, which should be acclaimed.

  [Text] A draft new constitution of the Komi republic was 
the main subject of discussion at a meeting of the parliament's 
presidium with an increased number of participants. The draft 
tries to combine in the new basic law the principles of 
territorial sovereignty on the basis of Russian federalism. The 
articles on freedoms of citizens are being amended to bring them 
in line with universally accepted norms. A program for 
implementing the law on the Komi republic's state languages 
caused debates. The majority of lawmakers regarded a list of 
posts that require the knowledge of two languages, Russian and 
Komi, as a limitation of civil rights. No agreement was reached 
on a list of the premises that should be equipped with systems 
for simultaneous translation at the expense of the budget. A 
decision was adopted on selling oil shares to people residing in 
oil-extracting regions on a preferential basis for money and 
vouchers. A strict provision on a procedure for holding 
competition for the right to use Komi natural resources was 
approved.

  [Text] Syktyvkar, Komi Republic, January 23 TASS -- A new 
draft constitution of the Komi Republic, northern Russia, 
prepared by a special commission at the republic's Supreme 
Soviet has been published in the local press for public 
consideration. 
  All state power bodies, public associations, labor 
collectives and inividuals are invited to submit their proposals 
and amendments to the commission, the Supreme Soviet presidium 
said in an address to the republic's residents, also released by 
the media. 
  All proposals must be submitted before February 2, 1994. 
  Under the presidium's decision, the draft constitution will 
be considered at the parliament's extraordinary session 
scheduled for February 15. 
  The draft reads that the Komi Republic is a democratic legal 
state within the composition of the Russian Federation. The 
draft nominates the multinational population of the Komi 
Republic as "the bearer of the republic's sovereighnty and the 
only source of the state power" which may execute its powers 
both directly, through participation in referendums and 
elections, and indirectly, through a system of state and local 
self-rule agencies. 
  In compliance with Russia' constitution, the state system of 
power bodies in the republic includes the state council, the 
head of the republic, the constitutional court, and a court 
system. Under the draft constitution, the state council is the 
highest representative and legislative body in the republic. 
The head of the republic is a "top official who directly leads 
the cabinet of ministers, which is the republic's highest 
executive power body".

<F P=106> [Natalya Abakumova report in the "Conflict" column: "The </F>
Ossetian-Ingush Talks Cannot Get Off the Ground"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Lozovoy, head of the provisional 
administration in the emergency rule zone on the territory of 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia, has stated, according to INTERFAX, 
that the situation in the conflict zone has been stabilized and 
human losses minimized. True, this has called for several tens 
of billions of rubles in direct expenditures from Russia. Mr. 
Lozovoy described the Ingush side's position on the return of 
the refugees as "unconstructive." In his opinion, the Ingushi 
are trying to force the relocation of refugees to Prigorodnyy 
Rayon in North Ossetia. "At the same time we have been very 
worried by the unwillingness of the Ossetian side to sit down at 
the negotiating table on this question prior to republican 
presidential elections," Vladimir Lozovoy noted. 
  Yesterday North Ossetia demanded the promulgation of a 
political and legal assessment of the October-November 1992 
events in the republic's Prigorodnyy Rayon, as a result of which 
some 500 people died, before the presidential talks are to begin. 
  President Yeltsin, concerned about with situation in the 
conflict zone, stated at a meeting with representatives of the 
Almaz women's Russian-speaking movement that he intends to 
enforce the edict. Furthermore, according to Ingushetia's 
permanent mission in Moscow, the president is going to visit the 
republic on 23 February, the anniversary of the deportation of 
the Ingush people in 1944.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Sanatin article: "Having Previously Overcome the </F>
Moscow Lobby, Boris Yeltsin Came Right Up Against Opposition 
from the Provincial `Emperors of the Taiga.' In This Struggle 
It Remains Unclear at Present Who Will Be Able To Break the Ural 
Range"] 
  [Text] Yekaterinburg -- Many local analysts regard the 
change of governor in Sverdlovsk Oblast as a victory for one 
commercial and industrial clan over another. The 14 January 
announcement that the oblast's former government was resigning 
en masse was no coincidence. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss 
Rossel is thereby disputed. The conclusion: The Ural lobby is 
heterogeneous, and a new breed of politicians have emerged who 
can dictate their will not only in the government but also to 
the president himself. 
  The working career of Aleksey Strakhov, the oblast's new 
governor who has replaced Eduard Rossel, is quite standard: 
student construction detachments; the territorial administration 
of the State Committee for Material and Technical Supply; 
Yekaterinburg City Hall. Recently he preferred to be the first 
deputy, in other words to control the essence of things while 
staying in the shadows. The rapid finish by the "gray horse" 
came as a complete surprise to the oblast's population.... 
  Such a "demarche" by Yeltsin also came as a surprise to 
Eduard Rossel, who believed that the writing and publication of 
the constitution of the Ural Republic gave unlimited power to 
him and to those close to business circles. Yes, Rossel's 
protectionism with regard to firms such as "Inter-Ural" (90 
percent of copper exports) and "Ural-Titan" (32 percent of all 
the world's titanium) gave Eduard Ergartovich the right to 
consider that he was de facto both the export-industrial leader 
and the political leader of the Urals. The draft constitution 
of the Ural Republic assigned to him his own security council, 
his own militia, his own court, his own banking support, his own 
foreign economic relations department.... That is, Eduard Rossel 
was becoming Akinfiy Demidov [18th-century industrialist] under 
the living Peter.... 
  But, if you recall, Peter I sent Captain Tatishchev to found 
Yekaterinburg (to counteract the mayhem of the Demidovs). Now, 
271 years after the Demidovs' dominion in the Urals, history has 
repeated itself. 
  It seems that the former governor did not attach great 
significance to Yekaterinburg City Hall's attempts to win back 
its agreed rights. Meanwhile, Yekaterinburg's industry, real 
estate, and advertising space are worth many firms blessed by 
Rossel. 
  Yekaterinburg's struggle against the arrogance of the oblast 
authorities began long ago. I believe that Arkadiy Chernetskiy 
and Aleksey Strakhov, first deputy head of Yekaterinburg, 
absolutely disliked the idea of the Ural Republic, in which they 
could remain "responsible for the capital's sewers." A huge 
proportion of the oblast center's real estate, including that 
leased by foreign consulates, would then have become the 
republic's property. 
  Now the entire government of Sverdlovsk Oblast is following 
Rossel in resigning! Yeltsin is being given to understand that, 
along with Rossel, he "dismissed" those who had been responsible 
for finances, transport, health care, and trade in the oblast 
ever since Boris Nikolayevich was first secretary here, in the 
Urals. Today it is stupid not to admit that the oblast lived 
thanks to these officials' years-long experience and colossal 
connections! 
  The president's circles believed that an opposition to the 
old industrial-monopoly and commercial clan would come into 
being in Yekaterinburg thanks to Strakhov's promotion. Such a 
struggle is better than one between the region and the center. 
Boris Nikolayevich is now getting -- in the person of Rossel and 
his business circles -- not only a sovereign-economic opposition 
but also a tough political one. It is paradoxical but, having 
previously overcome the Moscow lobby, Yeltsin came right up 
against the Ural lobby. Evidently, he must understand that this 
will be the case with every territory where "loyal colleagues 
and friends" remain. 
  Within a matter of days Eduard Rossel created the "Ural 
Transformation" nonparty sociopolitical association to nominate 
its candidacy for the Federation Council. Rossel is cunning 
when he calls his association a "nonparty" one. He simply did 
not want to associate his name with the Party of Consolidation, 
whose representative is Aleksandr Tikhonov, leader of the 
"Inter-Ural" Joint Venture. Precisely this party elaborated the 
new "Regional Development Concept," and it has the backing of 
the "Industrial Union" with the aggrieved military-industrial 
complex. "Ural Transformation" can be nonparty only in the 
sense of the treasury ruble's transformation into the 
nontreasury dollar.... 
  The fight to the death is continuing. I believe that 
Sverdlovsk Oblast's old government will flow into the new 
commercial structures and substructures of Rossel's business 
circle. Strakhov will have a hard time. The monopoly will 
endeavor to leave him in the role of the oblast's chief 
supplier, for they never lived in the age of competition and 
will never tolerate it! In the Federation Council Rossel will 
promote the principle of Russia's territorial division as a 
counterweight to national-territorial division and might become 
a Russian national hero. 
  What will the nonparty Yeltsin do in this situation?

  [Text] Nikolay Fedorov, the first president of the Chuvash 
Republic -- former Russian justice minister -- took office in 
Cheboksary today. We promised to give you the details about 
this event, so let us listen to a report by our correspondent 
Yevgeniy Nikonov. 
  [Nikonov] Taking up office and placing his hand on the 
Constitution of the Chuvash Republic, President Nikolay Fedorov 
took the oath: 
  [Fedorov] "I pledge, in carrying out my duties as president 
of the Chuvash Republic, to observe the Constitution and laws of 
the Chuvash Republic, the Constitution and laws of the Russian 
Federation, and to defend its sovereignty, to respect and 
preserve the rights and freedoms of the individual and the 
citizen, the rights of the peoples of the Chuvash Republic, and 
to conscientiously carry out the obligations entrusted to me by 
the people, which will be the guarantor of friendship and 
cooperation with all peoples, and to be responsible for my 
actions before the people." 
  [Nikonov] In his inaugural speech, in which he set out his 
political credo, Fedorov said that as president he would 
sanction freedom, knowledge, culture, and morality, and in the 
sphere of the economy he would support the people who are 
working and producing goods. 
  [Fedorov] "A politician can only become a professional and 
can only truly help Russia when we link him with the interests 
of the country's commodity producers and the will of the 
entities of the Russian Federation. The question is not so much 
one of dramatis personae as of the principle of shaping a 
mechanism to work out a policy that is answerable to the Russian 
people." 
  [Nikonov] On behalf of Russian President Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin, Fedorov was congratulated by Sergey Aleksandrovich 
Filatov, the head of the president's administration. 
  [Filatov] "Permit me, on the instructions of Russian 
President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, to heartily congratulate 
Nikolay Vasiliyevich Fedorov, the first president of the Chuvash 
Republic on his election, his taking of office, and the 
beginning of his work, and to wish him all the best on this path 
although it will be a very, very difficult one. I have to say 
that we have lived through a very tough and dramatic year, a 
year that has seen everything -- a crisis in the economy, a 
crisis of power, and a political crisis, and which, 
unfortunately, has ended in a dramatic way because of the fact, 
in the main, the structures of power have not been able to cope 
with the tasks and aspirations facing our country. It has to be 
said that the reformation of the power structures is under way, 
is continuing, and today the Chuvash Republic has also embarked 
upon the reformation of its own power structures, strengthening 
the authority of its executive structure."

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Matochkin, head of the Kaliningrad </F>
Oblast Administration, by N. Borovskaya; place and date not 
given: "It Is Easier To Win in Elections With Numbers; as Well 
as in Life"] 
  [Text] [Borovskaya] To begin with, I would like to 
congratulate you on the occasion of being elected a deputy to 
the Council of the Federation. 
  [Matochkin] Thank you. 
  [Borovskaya] How do you assess the results of the elections 
to the Council of the Federation in our oblast? 
  [Matochkin] The situation in the Kaliningrad Oblast is 
similar to that in Russia. However, we should study this 
situation, make conclusions, and weigh our mistakes. 
  The distribution of political forces during the elections in 
Kaliningrad Oblast is not so gloomy. In my opinion, despite a 
high percentage of voters who had supported Zhirinovskiy, the 
majority of our people favor reforms. The majority of the 
population have voted for democrats. They number some 75 
percent of the entire electorate. 
  [Borovskaya] How can you explain why Kaliningrad citizens -- 
despite all the complexities of our life -- traditionally 
support democratic trends? 
  [Matochkin] I would not speak about our democratic 
traditions. If you remember, during the presidential elections 
our citizens voted not for Yeltsin but for Zhirinovskiy? 
  However, after August 1991, public opinion began to change. 
That means that reforms began to work. The results of the 
April referendum in 1993, as well as the December elections in 
1993 proved this change. 
  [Borovskaya] Maybe our geopolitical localization is a 
factor.... Kaliningrad citizens see how the surrounding world 
is living, they believe that their life cannot be worse. Maybe 
this factor differentiates us from outlying Russian provinces? 
  [Matochkin] In my opinion, you are right. In fact, we see 
how people in other states, where radical reforms are 
implemented, live. This affects the state of mind, gives the 
impression of the irreversibility of changes. 
  [Borovskaya] Before the elections, you were hesitant either 
to run in the elections or to quit this idea. You do not regret 
your decision.... 
  [Matochkin] I am used to working with numbers. I am not an 
emotional person. Speaking sincerely, we -- the heads of the 
local administration -- have found ourselves in a dubious 
situation. If, according to the Constitution, only one 
representative of legislative and executive branches could run 
in the elections, how should the acting leaders of the 
administration behave? If the electorate does not elect me, how 
can I remain in the same position? 
  Yes, I was hesitant. I understood that I was taking risks, 
and some of my colleagues persuaded me not to participate in the 
elections. Therefore, I studied the situation through poll 
results. When in the last decade of the elections I understood 
what category of population supports me, I felt more confident. 
I understood that I had a moral right to represent our oblast 
in the new Russian legislature. 
  [Borovskaya] I have heard that your people had facilitated 
your elections by neutralizing your opponent Leonid Gorbenko and 
by pressing our Duma Deputy Yuriy Voyevoda.... 
  [Matochkin] From the start, we -- Leonid Gorbenko and I -- 
were in tandem. At that time, Shumeyko was not yet running in 
the elections and Gorbenko's rating was high. Over the last 
decade, everything changed. However, Leonid Gorbenko matched 
this situation perfectly well, and I had no reason to put him 
out of the elections. 
  On 7 December, I met with him and discussed the situation. 
All of a sudden, I received a phone call informing me that he 
had withdrawn his candidacy. It was a surprise to me. He had 
destroyed the planned situation. We knew who would receive his 
votes. 
  This turn of events was undesirable and sudden. I did not 
authorize anyone to talk to Leonid Gorbenko and if someone has 
taken the initiative, this is another case. In addition, I did 
not ask anyone to persuade Yuriy Voyevoda to withdraw his 
candidacy in exchange for my chair in the local administration. 
It is nonsense. How can you appoint an officer on active duty 
to a civil position? 
  [Borovskaya] That is clear. What about Shumeyko? We elected 
him according to his official post. We required a person in the 
government who could patronize the entire oblast. However, he 
can currently head the Council of the Federation. What will the 
oblast get from his election? 
  [Matochkin] He would be of greater use to us if he became a 
member of the government. However, if he becomes the chairman 
of the Council of the Federation, he could aid us in resolving 
the status of our oblast. 
  [Borovskaya] In my mind, we owe the rapid adoption of the 
edict "On Kaliningrad Oblast" to Shumeyko. Does this edict 
summarize our achievements in this sphere? 
  [Matochkin] Yes. Despite the fact that the edict has no word 
combination "free trade zone," it contains elements of "free 
trade zone" regulations, in particular, the lifting of 
export-import duty limitations and the introduction of tax 
breaks. 
  [Borovskaya] This edict has come into force from the moment 
it was signed, has it not? Is it currently being implemented? 
  [Matochkin] Yes, the edict has come into force. However, the 
mechanism for its implementation has not yet been developed. 
For example, what about customs duties? The value-added tax 
has been lifted, however, there are no regulations on how it 
should be lifted. 
  [Borovskaya] Who develops this mechanism: Moscow or 
Kaliningrad? 
  [Matochkin] All the documents are being drafted here. 
Later, they are sent to Moscow. We have to do a lot of work. 
For example, the issue of earmarking a tax credit for 
investments. What documents are required, who issues this 
credit, and so on. Such questions are arising on each and every 
issue. Each paragraph should be thoroughly developed, and the 
initiative is always in our hands. 
  How has the federal program for development of Kaliningrad 
Oblast appeared? I met with Chernomyrdin and said that we badly 
needed such a program. The Economy Ministry has allocated 170 
million rubles to its draft. Researchers from the Central 
Research Institute for Economic Issues, who had been charged 
with drafting this program, have already visited Kaliningrad. 
By the end of March 1994, we should present this draft program 
to the government. 
  [Borovskaya] What does this program give Kaliningrad? 
  [Matochkin] We want to provide centralized financing to the 
sites that are of all-Russian importance, such as airports, 
seaports.... 
  [Borovskaya] Under the former Supreme Soviet, attempts to 
receive our "own" law were enviously met by the representatives 
of other regions. Similar people will come to the Federal 
Duma.... 
  [Matochkin] We hope for the wisdom of the new Duma. We are 
going to explain our position. Currently, we are working on 
holding an international forum of Baltic states. It will be 
held in March in Sopot [Poland]. We invite representatives of 
all the oblasts of the North-West region and Central Russia to 
participate in this forum. 
  [Borovskaya] However, if your explanations do not help, what 
will happen then? 
  [Matochkin] Then, we will hold a referendum in Kaliningrad. 
The Council of the Federation will have to consider the 
viewpoint of the Federation. However, I am not a pessimist. 
Not a single initiative was left without the support of the 
president and the government. Deputies will debate this issue 
but the issue should be positively resolved. 
  [Borovskaya] Does this edict give our free trade zone any 
advantages before the other free trade zones of Russia? 
  [Matochkin] Are there any other zones? In the opinion of the 
international community, there are two such zones in Russia -- 
in Kaliningrad and Nakhodka. We are in a more advantageous 
position than Nakhodka is. However, it has more natural 
resources and a larger territory. We have a bigger foreign 
investment sector -- 9.5 percent of the total sum of Russian 
foreign investments. 
  Our ports are processing 4.5 million tonnes of freight (St. 
Petersburg -- 15-20 tonnes of freight). We can increase this 
figure to 10 million tonnes, and our final goal is to process 
30-40 million tonnes of freight. 
  [Borovskaya] Recently, Pavel Globa [famous CIS astrologist] 
has published his terrible prognosis of our near and distant 
future. What are your predictions at the beginning of the new 
year? 
  [Matochkin] I am not an opponent of Globa. Each of us has 
his 
own profession and earns money the way he can. However, we 
should become realists: If we begin to consider modern trends in 
the development of production, the tempos of collapse will 
decrease. I foresee the lowest critical level in 1994-95. We 
will not have worse times than we have already lived through. 
At the same time, two menacing specters are currently alarming 
me -- the rise of unemployment and the bankruptcy of 
enterprises. We should take some measures, in particular, to 
protect small- and medium-size business which must create new 
jobs for the unemployed. We are establishing a fund to protect 
these small- and medium-size businesses so that people are able 
to get credits for building their own workshops. However, 
bankruptcy is not as alarming; it just means changing the owner. 
  By the way, I have data showing that Kaliningrad citizens 
not 
only look at consumer goods in our shops but they buy them. In 
nine positions out of 20, Kaliningrad consumption indexes are 
higher in 1993 than in 1992. 
  It is important not to frighten ourselves with various 
troubles. Then our life will become better. This is my New Year 
wish.

  [Excerpts] Alain Lamassoure, French minister [delegate] for 
European affairs has ended his visit to Estonia. Erik Samel 
will sum up his visit. 
  [Samel] [passage omitted] According to the French minister, 
the main subject in his discussions with Estonian politicians 
were issues to do with European security, including the 
so-called Balladur plan or the European security pact, whose 
opening conference will take place in April, in Paris. The pact 
aims to provide an opportunity for all European countries to 
have their security ensured. The French minister emphasized 
that for France, Estonian security is also French security. 
  According to [Foreign Minister] Juri Luik, who also attended 
the news conference, Lamassoure's visit took place at a very 
good time for Estonia since Estonia is now taking great strides 
toward Europe. 
  [Begin Luik recording] We talked about several issues of 
mutual interest. First, of course, about security issues. The 
Estonian position is that the closer Estonia is to the European 
Union, the more Estonian security is safeguarded. Of particular 
importance here is Lamassoure's position -- which the Estonian 
side also encouraged -- that a free-trade agreement with Europe 
is a good thing but it must contain a strong political 
dimension. A political dimension, which, in fact, would equate 
us with the Visegrad foursome, would equate us with Poland, the 
Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. This is the position 
that the French minister emphasized and that is also what we 
emphasized. 
  We also emphasized the need to develop new European security 
structures. First and foremost, the West European Union. The 
West European Union is a promising organization alongside NATO. 
There was also talk about an associated member status, which is 
being developed at the West European Union. Given the status of 
an associated member Estonia would be willing to take part in 
the work of the West European Union. 
  We discussed the Balladur plan and the French minister 
emphasized (?and said that he is in full support of) the 
Balladur plan developing into a mechanism for resolving bones of 
contention between Estonia and Russia because the strength of 
the Balladur mechanism is that the European Union member states 
will act as guarantors to agreements reached. They will also 
help to broker such agreements. I would not, for example, rule 
out the possibility that the Estonian-Russian border issue may 
find a solution through precisely this mechanism, in the spirit 
of cooperation it provides. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 20, BNS -- The next round of 
intergovernmental talks between Estonia and Russia are to be 
held in a location near Moscow on Feb. 1-2. 
  The talks, originally scheduled for Jan. 18-19, were 
postponed at Russia's request after the Russian delegation 
leader Vasiliy Svirin was reported to have fallen ill. 
  The two parties reached agreement on the new date of the 
talks on Jan. 20, said Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian 
delegation. Russia has said it will this time present a detailed 
timetable for the withdrawal of its troops from Estonia. 
  Russia in the last round of talks suggested Aug. 31, 1994, 
as 
the final deadline for the pullout. Estonia has agreed in 
principle with the deadline but says Russia still must present a 
timetable showing the terms for the withdrawal of each major 
unit. 
  The head of the Estonian delegation, Vaino Reinart, has 
earlier said the presenting of the timetable won't affect the 
final deadline.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 22, BNS -- The Estonian Minister of 
Justice, Kaido Kama, says information published by the media 
provides reasons to suspect that the representative of Russian 
radical nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party in 
Estonia is engaged in activity aimed against Estonia's national 
interests. 
  A resident of the northeastern border town of Narva, Pyotr 
Rozhok, has identified himself as the representative of 
Zhirinovsky's misleadingly-named Liberal Democratic Party in 
Estonia. 
  "Concrete proof is needed to sanction legal action against 
Rozhok," Kama said. He added that a decision on Rozhok's 
possible arrest had to come from the country's Defense Police. 
  The minister said defense police officials first have to 
make 
sure if Rozhok really was a member of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
  The director general of the Defense Police, Juri Pihl, told 
BNS Rozhok was having a membership card of the party. 
  "But we cannot claim with full confidence that he is the 
party's official representative in Estonia," Pihl said. He 
added that Zhirinovsky's party had a few dozens of members in 
Estonia. 
  The security police chief said Rozhok in his statements had 
voiced disrespectfulness toward the Estonian president, the 
government and members of the parliament. 
  "I cannot say if this is sufficient for initiating criminal 
proceedings," he said. 
  The chief spokesman for the Russian Liberal Democrats, 
Eduard 
Yermolayev, confirmed to BNS that Rozhok was the party's 
official representative in Estonia.

  [Text] The Russian Representative Assembly has appealed to 
the Russian and U.S. Presidents for help with ending the 
continuing discrimination of Estonian inhabitants on the basis 
of their citizenship. An aggressive nationalist policy aimed at 
establishing a nation state, which manifests itself through a 
well-considered system of legislative acts, is directed toward 
ousting the Russian-language population from Estonia and brings 
them humiliation and suffering. This is what the appeal adopted 
at the session of the Representative Assembly's presidium on 18 
January says. 
  The appeal states that over a third of permanent Estonian 
residents have been declared to be foreigners; the principles of 
the Human Right Declaration and the Convention on the 
Elimination or Reduction of Statelessness have thereby been 
ignored. The Representative Assembly notes that until now the 
awarding of citizenship on the basis of one's free will has not 
been decided, as had been envisaged in the agreement on the 
foundations of interstate relations concluded between Estonia 
and Russia on 12 January 1991, as well as the granting of 
permits for permanent residence. This is what the 
Representative Assembly's statement says.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 22, BNS -- The Estonian Rural Centrist 
Party, which as a member of the Moderate alliance is part of the 
country's governing coalition, calls on the president to hire a 
special official to be responsible for contacts with the 
legislative body. 
  Rural Centrist leader Ivar Raig at a press conference Friday 
[21 January] said the president's parliament relations officer 
should attend the plenary meetings of the State Assembly and 
stay well informed of the work done by the parliamentary 
commissions so that no information blackout would again occur 
between the president and the parliament. 
  Raig, whose comments were about the recent dispute over 
Cabinet nominations between the president and the prime 
minister, said the ruling coalition and the government had been 
right to seek the replacement of Economics Minister Toomas 
Sildmae. 
  He said Sildmae was sacked because of his ministry's failure 
to work out laws. 
  "The Economics Ministry during the past year didn't submit 
to 
the parliament even one single original bill drawn up in 
ministry itself. The ministry paid more attention to industrial 
development and seeking contacts in other countries than to 
working out an economic policy," Raig said. 
  He also said that the practice when interest groups in the 
economy turned their requests to the president rather than the 
government or the parliament was contradicting the principles of 
a parliamentary state. 
  Raig was referrng to statements in support of Sildmae 
delivered to the president by a number of business associations 
and influence groups when the government revealed its plans for 
Sildmae's replacement.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 21, AP - BNS -- Lithuania will most 
likely become the first East European country to sign up next 
week for NATO's new plan granting limited partnerships to its 
former adversaries, officials said Friday [21 January]. 
  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas was scheduled to 
sign the "Partnership for Peace" document during a visit next 
Thursday to the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
  At a recent summit, President Clinton and other alliance 
leaders invited their Warsaw Pact foes to accept the plan, which 
would draw the nations closer but without granting them 
membership. 
  NATO officials said the East Europeans can begin signing the 
partnership document on Monday. 
  After they do, they will work out individual programs for 
taking part in military exercises, peacekeeping and other NATO 
activities. In turn, the nations will have to share information 
about defense budgets, promise civilian control over the 
military and standardize weapons systems. 
  Lithuania earlier this month became the first former Soviet 
republic to ask for membership in the alliance and the security 
guarantees that would go with it. Poland, Hungary and others 
also want to join. 
  But the allies have refused to admit the East Europeans, 
fearing to do so would create a new divide in Europe and isolate 
and upset Russia, a formidable military power.

  [Text] The political council of the Homeland Union has made 
public a statement on further steps in the consolidation of 
Lithuania's international security. The conservatives state 
that after Lithuania's official statement on its intention to 
join NATO, new steps will undoubtedly be taken. As Russia's 
foreign policy toward the Baltic states is becoming ever more 
aggressive, the political council of the party of conservatives 
believes that during the upcoming visit by Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas to Brussels and the signing of the document 
on cooperation for peace, the president should ask for 
consultations with NATO, provided by this document to Lithuania, 
as a partner who is facing direct threat to its territorial 
integrity, political independence, and security. 
  The political council of the party of conservatives is 
convinced that the NATO political consultants and observers 
should be working in Vilnius.

  [Text] Alain Lamassoure, French minister [delegate] for 
European affairs, told journalists last night that a defense 
cooperation treaty between Lithuania and France would be signed 
in the immediate future. The text of the treaty has already 
been coordinated, and it has been signed by Lithuanian National 
Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. Lamassoure said that he 
would take this treaty to French Defense Francois Leotard, who 
intends to visit Lithuania this year. 
  The purpose of the current official visit by Lamassoure is 
to 
establish economic and political contacts between France and 
Lithuania. According to Lamassoure, his visit has been speeded 
up by the parliamentary elections in Russia, because France has 
always supported the struggle of the Baltic countries for 
freedom, and it feels its responsibility regarding the situation 
here. 
  France thinks that North and Central European countries 
should have associated membership in the West European Union, a 
defense organization uniting nine West European states, 
Lamassoure said. France also has other initiatives concerning 
Lithuania. Negotiations on a trade agreement between Lithuania 
and the states of the European Union are taking place. 
Lamassoure said that this involves not only economic but also 
political agreement, which may decide Lithuania's admission to 
the European Union, if this Lithuania's wish. 
  Yet another proposal by France is the so-called Balladur 
plan-- submitted by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur--which 
concerns countries having problems with their neighbors or with 
national minorities. This is a kind of peace conference where 
the countries of the European Union would be mediators. It is 
planned to convene such a conference in Paris next April. 
  Lamassoure met on Friday the chairman of the Seimas, 
Ceslovas 
Jursenas, members of the Seimas Foreign Affairs Committee, 
representatives of all political forces, Foreign Minister 
Povilas Gylys, Defense Minister Linkevicius, and the leader of 
the opposition, Vytautas Landsbergis. He is meeting Prime 
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius today. 
  Lamassoure will go from Vilnius to Latvia.

  [Text] [Announcer] The minister of defense of the Czech 
Republic, Antonin Baudys, and the delegation headed by him began 
a visit to Lithuania on Monday. The report that follows was 
filed by Jonas Kernigis of the Lithuanian service of Radio 
Vilnius. 
  [Kernigis] The Czech defense minister was met at Vilnius 
airport by his Lithuanian counterpart, Linas Linkevicius, and 
other top-ranking military officials of the Ministry of Defense 
of the Republic of Lithuania. 
  The defense ministers of the two states had an exchange of 
opinion on bilateral cooperation between the Czech Republic and 
Lithuania. According to the Czech defense minister, Antonin 
Baudys, his country can sell Lithuania arms, if Lithuania 
expresses such a wish. Mr. Antonin Baudys said that the 
situation in Europe was complicated, following the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, and owing to the unending 
military conflict in the Balkans. The war actions in the 
Balkans make NATO be cautious about admitting post-communist 
states to the organization. The Czech minister of defense, Mr. 
Antonin Baudys: 
  [Begin Baudys recording in Czech, fading to English 
translation] The government of the Czech Republic considered the 
issue of NATO membership all through the year 1993. Therefore 
the American Partnership for Peace initiative did not surprise 
us. We realised that this is the maximum that can be achieved 
in Europe. We were the first to approve the project. We 
understand that NATO must treat Russia as an economic and 
military partner. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] According to the Czech minister of defense, the 
Visegrad states, namely Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and 
Hungary, as well as other East European states, seek NATO 
membership, striving to ground [as heard] that cooperation on a 
democratic state system and market economy. The Czech Republic 
also speaks up for the preservation of the existing state 
borders in Europe, and against the formation of any new military 
blocs on the continent. According to the Czech defense 
minister, the U.S. Partnership for Peace project makes it 
possible to put into practice the potential of East and Central 
European states, without doing harm to the peculiar interests of 
a given country. 
  According to the Czech minister of defense, Antonin Baudys, 
it was accentuated during the visit of the American President 
that the Partnership for Peace initiative did not only mean 
cooperation in the military sphere: 
  [Begin Baudys recording] The words uttered by the U.S. 
President during the visit to the Czech Republic witnessed that 
the United States will support European states by way of 
economic programs and investment. A draft of such cooperation 
has already been worked out and it will soon be submitted to the 
Czech Government. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] According to the Czech defense minister, each 
East European state must draw up its individual program of 
participation in the Partnership for Peace project. Lithuanian 
minister of national defense, Linas Linkevicius, told Radio 
Vilnius that new links of partnership with the Czech Republic 
were going to be established. 
  [Begin Linkevicius recording] Five groups of Lithuanian 
officers will go to the Czech Republic to gain experience there. 
At present, deputy minister of defense and the commander of the 
Air Force are having a course in that country, too. We expect 
Czech assistance in the sphere of armament development. 
Cooperation between the two states is concrete and fruitful, 
and that is most important. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The defense minister of the Czech Republic will 
stay in Lithuania until Wednesday. The official visit of the 
Czech minister envisages meetings with Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas and chairman of parliament, Ceslovas 
Jursenas. He will also visit units of the Lithuanian Army in 
Vilnius, Kaunas and Siauliai.

<F P=106> [Report by Tamara Nikolayeva in the "Lithuania" column: </F>
"The Outcome of the January `Games' in the Baltics May Be a 
Death Sentence for Lithuanian Communists. Their Arrest Has 
Provided Cause To Revise the `Tragic January' in Vilnius"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The most independent of 
Lithuania's independent newspapers, RESPUBLIKA, in one of its 
recent issues cited K. Gashki, a member of the Seimas National 
Security Committee, as saying that such an action [the 
Belarusian authorities' arrest of Lithuanian Communists in 
Minsk] may threaten Lithuania with an undesirable political 
scandal for two reasons: First, Lithuanian armed officials have 
crossed the Lithuanian- Belarusian border; and second, the 
capacity in which Lithuanian General Prosecutor Arturas 
Paulauskas visited Minsk to hold talks about the possibility of 
arresting Mikolas Burokyavicius and Yuozas Yermolavicius. 
According to Gashki and another member of the Seimas National 
Security Committee, A. Ivashkyavicius (who, it will be noted, 
has no sympathy for either communism or communists), the 
operation to detain these persons, who have long been on the 
wanted list of Lithuanian law enforcement bodies, could have 
been carried out only by Belarus officials, whereupon they were 
handed over to the Lithuanian side on the border of the two 
states. Incidentally, the above mentioned members of the 
Lithuanian Seimas National Security Committee suggest that the 
arrest of Burokyavicius and Yermolavicius became possible only 
because they were "sold out." "We would never have gotten 
Mikolas Burokyavicius or Yuozas Yermolavicius if it was not 
beneficial to Moscow," K. Gashki told RESPUBLIKA's 
correspondent. "They were transferred to Lithuania so that in 
the course of a judicial process in Vilnius some tasks 
confronting a `third party' could be resolved; in other words, 
Moscow is imposing its own rules of the game on Lithuania." 
According to the National Security Committee members, it would 
be a mistake to think that Burokyavichus and Yermolavichus were 
the organizers and perpetrators of the coup attempted in January 
1991. The Lithuanian communist leaders could not have played a 
role greater than stage director assistants because "they had no 
way of calling in a paratroopers division from Pskov or 
summoning V. Sakalauskas, former chairman of the Lithuanian 
Council of Ministers, who at the time was a staff member at the 
Soviet Embassy in Mozambique and was allegedly tasked with 
composing a new Lithuanian government. Also, it certainly took 
more than the desire or will of the Lithuanian communists to get 
Soviet armored cars into the streets of Vilnius. [passage 
omitted] 
  Time will tell whether the ongoing trial of the communist 
leaders in Vilnius will be used to strip some veils of secrecy 
from the January and subsequent events. On one hand, it would 
be very attractive for Lithuania to reveal the role of a third 
state. But on the other, there is the danger of also exposing 
some internal mechanisms and levers about which the Lithuanian 
social democratic weekly LETUVOS ZHINES wrote recently. 
According to the paper, the leaders of Sajudis, which was in 
power in 1990-1991, came to the conclusion that Moscow could be 
forced to abandon its plans of preserving Lithuania as part of 
the USSR precisely by aggravating the situation because it 
feared bloodshed. Sajudis members, the paper writes, 
deliberately insulted and provoked the army, and calls for armed 
resistance were coming from all quarters. In chess, a victory 
appears the more brilliant the more pawns and other pieces have 
been sacrificed. On the evening of 12 January 1991 the radio 
and TV were urging the people to congregate around the TV tower 
in Vilnius, assuring them that Soviet soldiers would be using 
only blanks. As a result, 13 people were killed and hundreds 
wounded or injured. According to LETUVOS ZHINES, it was the 
persistent sadistic propaganda about armed defense that gave the 
attackers cause for using firearms against peaceful, unarmed 
civilians. Gunmen from the Alfa group, the paper writes, 
accepted the offered chess sacrifice: It was the final response 
from the USSR leadership -- a personal punishment for Vytautas 
Landsbergis. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 420] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 21, ELTA -- A newly appointed chairman 
of parliamentary National security committee Vytautas 
Petkevicius MP [member of parliament] arranged his first news 
conference on Friday [21 January]. 
  He told the news conference Lithuanian Army could not fight 
against an aggressor for any longer period of time, therefore 
the national defence conception should be based on the 
resistance of all the nation. But the Army is not ready even 
for that -- it seems to be very poor. 
  Meanwhile, bureaucrats of National Defence Ministry live in 
prosperity. Petkevicius said the committee would do its best to 
leave not more than 30-40 employees in the ministry instead of 
214. And the Army is needed as much as the state is capable to 
maintain. 
  130 million lats [as received] are provided for needs of 
national defence in 1994 and this reflects real possibilities of 
today. Petkevicius expressed indignation the means were used 
irrationally and sometimes even wasted. 
  Voluntary National Defence Service /SKAT/ should be a 
reserve 
of Armed Forces, a sub-unit of National Defence Ministry and not 
an organization organizing rallies, Petkevicius said. Some 
units and services of SKAT are headed by people with no 
understanding of military things. 
  Speaking about state border protection Petkevicius said it 
should be and will be given over to the border police. 
  National Security service was in principle destroyed by 
earlier governments and now the things must be newly restored, 
Petkevicius said. Lithuania had become an object of 
international spying. Foreign secret services knew about 
Lithuania, its national defence and national security more than 
Lithuania itself, he added. 
  The committee is preparing draft laws determining activity 
of 
services of national defence and national security, Petkevicius 
said.

  [Text] The Baltic News Service reports that the Lithuanian 
General Procuracy will today institute criminal proceedings 
concerning financial machinations in the supply of arms to the 
Lithuanian Army. This was announced at a news conference given 
by Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas National 
Security Committee. According to him, all the reports in the 
newspapers RESPUBLIKA and LIETUVOS RYTAS on the purchase of 
helicopters and warships are correct. 
  Petkevicius said that everything will be decided by the 
court, but he is convinced that many machinations and the 
creation of various closed joint stock companies have harmed 
(?the litas). He also stressed that there are people with two 
or three previous convictions serving in military units. 
According to the law, they should not be given arms. 
  Speaking about the main tasks facing the Seimas National 
Security Committee, Vytautas Petkevicius mentioned the 
conclusion of the creation of the army legal base [as heard], 
the handing over of border protection duties to the border 
police, and the creation of the national security service. 
According to him, the national security service has been 
neglected but is now in the embryo stage. 
  Meanwhile, Lithuania has become a hotbed of espionage. Both 
the East and West are spying, and Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev and Western experts know more about the Lithuanian Army 
than its commanders, Petkevicius claimed. Petkevicius refused 
to dwell further on the activity of foreign special services, 
saying that he has no right to do this. Speaking about the 
arrest of Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas Jermalavicius, he 
stressed that due to rumors by some Lithuanian officials in 
describing events on the border [as heard], the Belorusian 
minister of internal affairs and the procurator general have 
suffered a great deal.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 21, BNS -- Lithuanian Defense Minister 
Linas Linkevicius came under severe criticism of the ruling 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDLP] faction for a number of 
unsolved problems in the system of national defense. 
  Linkevicius, who is a member of the LDLP faction himself, 
was 
appointed as defense minister last fall on the recommendation of 
his faction. 
  On Thursday [20 January], the board of the LDLP faction 
invited Linkevicius for a discussion. MP Arvydas Ivaskevicus, 
member of the parliament's National Security Committee, called 
Linkevicius' attention to "machinations" of high-ranking Defense 
Ministry officials. The lawmaker said he obtained information 
that the ministry unlawfully rents military facilities to 
commercial structures. 
  The meeting's participants said they are concerned about a 
high death and injury rate in the Armed Forces. "The Lithuanian 
Army is a smaller model of the Soviet Army," Ivaskevicius said. 
  MP Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the National Security 
Committee, said he is completely unsatisfied with the national 
defense reorganization plan that was submitted to the president 
behind the committee's back.

  [Text] Vilnius -- Budget appropriations for Lithuanian 
territorial defense needs in 1994 will remain proportionally 
unchanged compared to last year, comprising 4.6 percent of the 
budget. However, the size of these appropriations has increased 
60 percent and stands at 130 million litai (approximately $33 
million). This was announced by Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius. 
  National Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius is sure that, 
despite these meager budget appropriations, the country will be 
able to establish a defense system that befits our membership of 
international security structures.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 20, BNS -- Lithuania's Future Forum 
will soon register its faction in the Lithuanian parliament, MP 
[member of parliament] Aleksandras Bendinskas told reporters 
Thursday [20 January]. 
  Bendinskas, who is a member of the forum, said the matter 
will be decided by all representatives of the organization in 
parliament. The forum participated in parliamentary elections on 
the list of Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDLP]. In 
Bendinskas' words, the forum currently holds 22 seats. 
  A possibility to form a new faction appeared when the 
parliament amended its statute and allowed to create faction 
regardless of affiliation in pre-election lists. 
  Up until now, the ruling LDLP faction had 71 seats and 
enjoyed an absolute majority. If it loses 22 members, as well 
several others who intend to leave it during faction 
reregistration, the ruling faction will become almost equal to 
the rightist opposition coalition in size. There is a 
possibility, however, that the ruling majority will remain as 
unified as earlier when dealing with key issues.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 21, BNS -- The initiative group of 
the Lithuanian Union of Leftists (LUL) published its draft 
program saying that the union would be a parliamentary party 
of democratic-socialist orientation. 
  The draft was published Friday [21 January] as a classified 
ad in the leftist TIESA newspaper. According to unofficial 
reports, the LUL wants to unite former members of the Soviet 
Communist Party, who broke away from Moscow in 1990 but neither 
joined the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party nor the pro-Moscow 
wing of the Lithuanian Communist Party. 
  The emergence of a political organization based on the LUL 
program would mean the creation of a new communist party in 
Lithuania. The draft says, however, that the union would 
be a completely new political force, unrelated to "communist and 
Stalinist crimes." 
  The program emphasizes the need to protect "the interests 
of the biggest, most impoverished and robbed part of the 
population."

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 21, BNS -- The Lithuanian parliament 
bowed to the president's veto that was put on the law on income 
declaration by officials and civil servants. The law was 
rejected during repeat consideration Thursday [20 January] by a 
53-13 vote, with 34 abstentions. 
  The abstentions virtually determined that the president's 
veto would come into effect. 71 votes were needed to approve 
the law repeatedly. In such case, the president's would have to 
sign the law and to promulgate it within three days. 
  During debates, a majority of lawmakers said the problem of 
income declaration by officials should be referred to the 
Constitutional Court. 
  President Algirdas Brazauskas sent the law back to the 
parliament for reconsideration because, in his opinion, some 
portions of the law contradict the constitutional principles of 
property inviolability and equality before the law. 
  The law was first adopted Dec. 23 under pressure of the 
rightist opposition. The law set two deadlines for income 
declaration by officials - May 1, 1994 for property owned prior 
to Feb. 1, 1994 and March 1, 1995 for property acquired in 1994.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 22, BNS -- Lithuanian national 
security institutions categorically denied press reports that 
Vytautas Karinauskas, former head of the 1st KGB department in 
Lithuania, is employed in the National Security Service [NSS]. 
  Suppositions appeared Friday [21 January] in the RESPUBLIKA 
newspaper. 
  "He is definitely not in the staff of the service," 
well-informed sources said and added that the basic principles 
of the NSS remain unchanged -- former KGB leaders cannot be 
employed in Lithuanian security. 
  Experts said, however, that Karinauskas may have been 
invited 
for consultations when certain structures of the NSS were being 
created. The 1st KGB department was engaged in espionage. 
  Experts characterize Karinauskas as a "Western-minded" 
person, who has considerable experience of work abroad and is a 
"top level professional." Experts said Lithuanian national 
security services often lack such features.

<F P=106> [Stas Stremidlovskiy report: "This `Hour' Will Not Solve Our </F>
Problems"] 
  [Text] It would seem that the "Parliamentary Hour" 
broadcast had died a sudden death, but... Yesterday morning at 
the request of Deputy Marychev (from the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia), the question of resuming the ill-fated 
"Parliamentary Hour" was included on the agenda. Apart from 
this, the faction comprising the Communists, Agrarians, 
Zhirinovskiy-ites, and "Russian Way" deputies' group and the 
"Women of Russia" affiliated to it issued a statement which 
says: "ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and YURIDICHESKAYA GAZETA ROSSII 
should once again become parliamentary publications of the State 
Duma." 
  "Trying to revive such a program is not the way to go. It 
was devised in order to wage the war between the two branches of 
power more successfully," Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the 
mass media committee, told your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 
correspondent. 
  [Stremidlovskiy] "Mikhail Nikiforovich, if the State Duma 
does nevertheless adopt a resolution to revive `Parliamentary 
Hour,' how will you implement it?" 
  [Poltoranin] "But it is impossible to implement. 
`Parliamentary Hour' cannot return in its previous form." 
  Mikhail Poltoranin said that his committee was elaborating a 
draft law on the provision of information on state organs. The 
basic thesis is that the state organs should collaborate with 
the mass media on a voluntary basis. It is easier with state 
television: It will be instructed to allocate some airtime for 
relaying parliamentary, government, or presidential news.

<F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova article under the "In Parliament" rubric: </F>
"Federation Council: Parkinson's Law in Action"] 
  [Text] After one week's work, the upper chamber of 
parliament completed its first session Saturday [15 January]. 
Having roughly formed committees and appointed several 
chairmen, the Federation Council members went their separate 
ways (on foot and by transport) until 31 January. The previous 
day, Friday, had been possibly the least quiet day: The list of 
committees was being approved, in other words our senators were 
deciding on the range of questions which they intend to tackle. 
Attempts to reduce the number of committees to a minimum were 
not crowned with success. Two trends were at odds: Toward 
reducing the list and, conversely, toward extending it -- if not 
up to the number being proposed in the Duma, then close to it. 
The arguments of the supporters of the "minimum": The number 
of internal structures must correspond to the chamber's powers 
enshrined in the Constitution. They also tried to persuade 
people to take into account the small size of the corps of 
deputies of the Federation Council, compared with the Duma. The 
opponents emphasized the importance of state problems, which 
cannot be resolved without corresponding structures. The 
speaker played a considerable role in the outcome of the debate. 
At first he curbed the senators' appetites, but gradually he 
not only yielded to pressure from the "extenders" but also used 
his own levers of influence in order to support them. The 
levers are well known: A return to decisions not made earlier, 
repeat votes, "information," and commentaries (incidentally, in 
violation of the standing orders -- for which several deputies 
reprimanded Vladimir Shumeyko). 
  As a result, two additional committees were set up: one on 
science, education, and culture, the other on agrarian policy. 
The possibility cannot be ruled out that at its next session 
the chamber will return once again to the "very important" 
question of a committee "on the norths," and there will 
certainly be a proposal to set up a committee to combat crime, 
and so on. It seems that the Federation Council, like any 
structure, will be inclined, according to Parkinson's law, to 
expand its functions and to complicate its internal organization. 
  The chamber will undoubtedly be organized also along 
political lines. Despite the chairman's firm intention to 
prevent the Federation Council from splitting into factions, it 
will hardly be possible to curb political differentiation. The 
Communists' representation here is strong (although officially 
12 people ascribe themselves to the Communist Party), and the 
national patriotic idea has its adherents. The creation of 
groups along sectoral and professional lines (directors, 
farmers, and so on) and the forming of territorial blocs are 
possible. Understandably, all these deputies' associations, 
registered or unofficial, are needed to lobby for the real 
interests of large groups of the population. The point is that 
national interests should not get lost behind party, 
professional, and regional interests.

<F P=106> [Interview with Issa Kostoyev, chairman of the Federation </F>
Council Committee for Legislation and Judicial and Legal 
Reforms, by Yevgeniy Skukin; place and date not given: "Laws 
Must Operate With Precision"] 
  [Text] I tracked down Issa Kostoyev, newly elected 
chairman of the Federation Council Committee for Legislation and 
Judicial and Legal Reforms, who is chief of the Investigations 
Department of the General Prosecutor's Office and a state 
counsellor third class, during a break in proceedings. (For a 
while last year he was the Russian president's representative in 
the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone.) 
  [Skukin] Do you intend to return to the Ossetian-Ingush 
problem -- this time in your new capacity? 
  [Kostoyev] It will be time to extend the president's edict 
on the state of emergency in the conflict zone in a few days' 
time, and I, as chairman of the Federation Council Committe for 
Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reforms, will insist that a 
group of deputies travel to the trouble spot first. 
  [Skukin] Issa Magametovich, what matters within your area of 
competence are truly urgent? 
  [Kostoyev] It is essential to establish which power 
structures are to deal with what. The introduction of trial by 
jury has revealed Russia's all-around lack of preparation for 
civilized legal proceedings. Our laws are often ill-drafted and 
contradictory. A huge army of investigators from the former 
Security Ministry has been jettisoned, but not every lawyer is 
capable of being an investigator. These people won't be wasted; 
they are professionals, and they are going into commercial 
structures. Investigation, however, will suffer: Only 40 
percent of crimes are being detected now. 
  [Skukin] What will you be seeking to achieve when you start 
your new job? 
  [Kotsoyev] I will be seeking firmly and persistently to 
ensure that when we draft Russian laws we include within them a 
mechanism for their implementation. Laws must operate with 
clockwork precision.

Rossel: Federation Council Was Subjected to Pressure. 
Sverdlovsk Oblast Deputies Want To Set Up `Urals Group' in 
Federation Council"] 
  [Text] Eduard Rossel and Galina Karelova, Federation 
Council deputies from Sverdlovsk Oblast, spoke to journalists in 
Yekaterinburg on the results of the first meeting of the Russian 
parliament's upper chamber. 
  Eduard Rossel said that he was astonished by the undisguised 
pressure exerted on the deputies by the "top chiefs." The thing 
is that on the morning before the vote 58 heads of 
administration (they were lodged at the President Hotel, not the 
"Rossiya") were invited to breakfast with Mr. Chernomyrdin, 
where, to all appearances, they were given a directive to vote 
for Vladimir Shumeyko. The same went for representatives of the 
military-industrial sector, the deputy said. Given that 32 
deputies from "Siberian Agreement," who had earlier decided to 
vote for Mr. Romanov, general director of an association from 
Krasnoyarsk, voted for Shumeyko, as a result the latter won by a 
margin of eight or nine votes. 
  Galina Karelova, who was elected chairman of the Russian 
Federation Council's social policy committee, sees the situation 
somewhat differently. 
  "I think there was an element of persuasion," she told the 
journalists, "but the voting was held by secret ballot, and 
administration heads are exceptionally independent people who do 
not seem to me very amenable to pressure from above. In 
addition, Vladimir Shumeyko managed to impress the deputies: he 
is very self- disciplined, restrained, and calm. He did not 
leave an impression of a man lacking firm view or convictions." 
  Both Eduard Rossel and Galina Karelova spoke out for setting 
up a deputy group comprising Federation Council members from the 
Urals. Mr. Rossel plans to create it on the basis of the 
Economic Cooperation Association of the Urals Region's Oblasts 
and Republics. Ms. Karelova thinks that this group could operate 
as a deliberative conference of deputies from the Urals that 
would help them hold a joint, mutually advantageous stance in 
parliament.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Ivan Rybkin, newly elected </F>
Chairman of the State Duma, by Aleksandr Gamov; place and date 
not given: "Ivan Rybkin: A Man From Whom a Great Deal Is 
Expected? The Chairman of the Russian State Duma Believes: 
`Black October' Must Not Happen Again. Ivan Petrovich Does Not 
Intend Quarrelling with Boris Nikolayevich and Hopes for 
Reciprocity"] 
  [Text] Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the Russian State 
Duma, is inaccessible to the majority of journalists for the 
simple reason that they are not allowed into the hall of 
sessions, so it is very fortunate that he is my neighbor -- the 
windows of our buildings face one another. It seemed to me that 
this was reason enough to meet one evening, have a drink, and 
have a neighborly chat. Especially since Ivan Petrovich did not 
object but only asked that we restrict ourselves to tea. 
Therefore, when I went to visit him at his home I did not take 
any champagne with me but took instead a jar of cherry jam. 
  The State Duma speaker met me in the entrance hall and 
appropriately enough was wearing carpet slippers. When he had 
brewed some strong, aromatic tea himself (it was late and his 
domestics were already in bed) and poured some jam into the 
dishes, I made the somewhat unfortunate gaff of saying rather 
inopportunely that the last time I had met with a speaker was 
also at night -- in the White House at the end of September. 
Generally speaking we have not had much luck with speakers.... 
  [Rybkin] Indeed, neither Lukyanov nor Khasbulatov had an 
enviable fate. But as for my fears about my own future and 
drawing parallels with my predecessors.... I can say only one 
thing: In those parts where I was born -- the Khoper region -- 
they respect somewhat different qualities in people. 
Consequently, when sitting in the chair of the leader of the 
State Duma, I do not feel timid and certainly have no fears for 
my career. 
  [Gamov] Ivan Petrovich, is it true that the Duma members 
intend creating a special deputies' commission to investigate 
the events of September and October? 
  [Rybkin] Let us not dodge the issue here -- clearly some 
deputies do have that intention and with good reason. It was 
Talleyrand who said: "In a revolution no one is innocent. 
Everyone is guilty!" If it were up to me alone I would grant an 
amnesty to the participants in the events of August 1991 and 
September-October 1993. With the exception of those who 
committed flagrant crimes. That would be a necessary 
prerequisite for civil peace and accord, things which are very 
necessary to Russia now. 
  Society suffered a very serious blow after the October 
events, and so did parliamentarianism. In these conditions the 
State Duma and the Federation Council simply must cooperate as 
closely as possible with both the president and the government. 
I personally am firmly in favor of that. After all, we were 
elected not for our own sakes or for some ambitions that we may 
have but so as to establish stability, calm, and order in the 
country at last. 
  [Gamov] But how do you intend forming relations with the 
upper chamber? People are already describing the State Duma and 
the Federation Council as polar opposites.... 
  [Rybkin] As of the present moment -- Vladimir Filippovich 
Shumeyko and I have already spoken about this -- there are no 
insuperable obstacles between the State Duma and the Federation 
Council. In both chambers there are people from the same places 
with similar habits and outlooks. Their views, opinions, and 
convictions easily coincide with one another and I hope that 
they will adapt just as easily to the kind of professional draft 
laws that Russia urgently needs today. 
  Shumeyko and I also discussed the possibility of close 
cooperation between deputies from the two chambers on questions 
affecting the set of draft laws on the economy. Today the 
legislative base is lagging behind events in the economy. For a 
very long time we criticized industrialists for the fact that 
they forgot which words are associated with the noun "industry" 
-- earning a living, perhaps? Now they understand those words 
-- but in what sense? Billions of dollars are still flowing out 
of the country. Some people suggest resorting to tough 
administrative measures to prevent that. But I think that first 
of all we must give our industrialists an economic incentive to 
keep their money in Russia so that it can work for the good of 
the country. Although in those places where there is flagrant 
theft going it is necessary to use authority, of course. 
  Generally speaking I support a strong authority in Russia. 
But in my view that can only be achieved when all the branches 
of power are working in conditions of mutual support. Even 
those who consider themselves political opponents cannot live 
without each other today. The time for a Russian version of the 
Moncloa pact -- the pact which once dragged Spain out of the 
most dire crisis and transformed it into a prosperous country -- 
passed long ago. In Volgograd we once managed to work out that 
kind of agreement. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wrote about that, by the 
way -- that pact of local significance is still operating there 
today. But it was difficult to do that on a Russia-wide scale 
-- the ability and desire were lacking. But I believe that all 
is not yet lost. 
  There is a simple piece of what I would call peasant 
philosophy which I find encouraging. It runs like this: Where 
there is harmony there is prosperity, too. I know that the 
overwhelming majority of members of the State Duma and the 
Federation Council feel the same way. 
  [Gamov] Listening to you talk it sounds as though the 
speaker's chair is the domain not of higher education professors 
but of peasants from the land.... 
  [Rybkin] It is best to ask Khasbulatov himself why things 
did not work out for him in parliament. Especially since I do 
not want to portray myself as a simple peasant. Our present 
parliamentarians and leaders of the State Duma and Federal 
Assembly have experienced something which neither the deputies 
of the former parliament nor its speaker had experience of -- I 
mean "Black October." I believe that it was a painful 
experience for the president and the government, too. The 
events which unfolded last fall are a grave warning to us all. 
If we draw the correct conclusions from all that happened we 
will of course benefit greatly. We are simply fated to achieve 
accord! 
  [Gamov] You know, Ivan Petrovich, that I have attended 
sessions of the Duma, I compared it with the previous Supreme 
Soviet and it seemed to me that elements of buffoonery are 
appearing in the Russian parliamentary system... 
  [Rybkin] That also worries and alarms me. But in the 
present situation this is inevitable. Deputies are seeking to 
make a statement about themselves, they are anxious and that is 
why there is a somewhat tense atmosphere and a certain 
eccentricity here.... But do not forget that in the old Supreme 
Soviet there were 252 people working with 126 people holding 
sessions in each of the chambers, whereas now there are 450 
deputies. By the old standards that is a whole congress! And 
trying to make this mechanism work efficiently and smoothly from 
the very outset is very difficult. 
  Incidentally, I would like to make use of this occasion to 
tell the representatives of the Russian and foreign mass media 
not to take offense at us. We are not allowing Duma sessions to 
be filmed at present and certainly not to be broadcast live 
because we have the usual routine work to get through, the 
running-in period, as it were. This is hardly of interest to 
the outside observer. But I hope that this will not take long. 
The factions and committees are beginning work.... 
  [Gamov] But what then? 
  [Rybkin] Our program of legislative activity is very 
extensive. The Russian President's Legislative Proposals 
Commission and our deputies' commissions have worked hard to 
draw it up and many Duma members came to Moscow with a whole set 
of drafts and proposals. All these things are being processed 
and considered. 
  Incidentally, I would like to warn people that it is 
certainly not the frenzied activity of sessions in the Duma that 
will decide the fate of draft laws. Factions and committees are 
the main structural units of lawmaking, this is where we intend 
to do the main "fine-tuning" work on documents. In this regard 
our fundamental premise is that the factions express the 
intentions of certain groups of voters and the ideas of 
coordinating the interests of all strata of the population will 
be implemented through them. But the Duma will have to meet in 
session four to five hours a couple of times a week to adopt the 
final decisions. 
  If you look at it closely you will see that we do not have 
all that much time. 
  [Gamov] Indeed.... 
  [Rybkin] The first month of our term as deputies is already 
over, if you discount the three months spent on the new election 
campaign at the end of the term that leaves us with 12 months. 
Our task is to make the maximum use of that time so as to 
highlight those top-quality draft laws which relate first and 
foremost to the development of the economy. We must restore its 
manageability as soon as possible and at the very least 
neutralize the worst consequences of the crisis. 
  [Gamov] Do you also intend trying to influence the president 
and the government as the Supreme Soviet tried to do? 
  [Rybkin] The situation in society is difficult, there is a 
major social differentiation in progress: People have divided 
into the very rich and the very poor, one-half of the country's 
population is below the poverty line and around 10 percent are 
in desperate conditions. 
  The president is right when he says that it was dire 
necessity above all which brought people out into the streets in 
the fall. We must remember that. Taking all this into account, 
of course, we intend to influence the formation of the 
government, its line of conduct, and the process of implementing 
the economic program -- but within the framework of the 
Constitution, nowhere else. I believe that far more significant 
influence can be achieved through mutual understanding. After 
all, if people insult one another and order each other about 
there will be no progress. 
  The most important thing is not to cross the line where 
opposition turns into enmity and opponents into enemies, when 
people forget the reason why they began the argument in the 
first place. That is the most dangerous thing.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin wishes the State 
Duma success in its work and assures that he will support it in 
every possible way, Speaker of the Lower Chamber Ivan Rybkin 
said. He informed the deputies on Friday [21 January] about his 
meetings with the president and with Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin the day earlier. 
  Rybkin pointed out the constructive character of his talks 
with the president. He said Yeltsin expressed readiness for 
permanent interaction with the State Duma and suggested holding 
regular meetings with the chamber's speaker at least once a 
month. 
  Rybkin said that he had discussed with the president the 
State Duma's location. The chamber's speaker noted that the 
State Duma will receive the facilities which formerly belonged 
to the Supreme Soviet. Rybkin mentioned "a wonderful building 
which has a total area of not less than that of the current 
building of the State Duma or of the building of the former 
Supreme Soviet, and which is much better equipped." However, he 
refrained from answering a question what this building is, 
saying only that he would not like to talk about it now and that 
"there are many choices." 
  The speaker of the State Duma informed deputies that the 
president had signed a decree disbanding the earlier formed 
staff of the Federal Assembly and forming independent staffs of 
the Council of Federation and the State Duma. 
  Commenting on the two-hour meeting with Chernomyrdin, Rybkin 
said that the State Duma would be given the institute of 
comparative science of law of the former Supreme Soviet. He 
also said that on Friday the premier planned to hold a 
conference with participation of all services in Moscow in order 
to discuss the acceleration of the restoration of the buildings 
housing the State Duma now. Up to 500 construction workers will 
be sent there.

  According to this document, the State Duma forms its 
committees "on the basis of proportional representativeness of 
deputy associations." The State Duma determines the number of 
each committee, "which should be not less than 12 and not more 
than 35 deputies." 
  The provision says that every deputy, except the chairman, 
his deputies, and leaders of deputy associations and 
deputy-members of the government, should be in one of the Duma's 
committees. 
  A committee's session is considered valid if more than half 
of the total number of its members are attending the session. 
Decisions are adopted by simple majority of votes given the 
number of deputies attending the session.

  [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
will devote one hour every Friday to discussing the activities 
of the gvernment and the Agrarian Party plans to support its 
leader and Deputy Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha before the new 
composition of the government is announced. 
  The Duma decided on Wednesday [19 January] that it will 
devote the last hour of each Friday to discussing the work of 
the government which lawmaker Georgiy Zadonskiy said would allow 
the lower chamber to "quickly react to various decisions of 
Viktor Chernomyrdin's team". 
  The lawmakers are also going to discuss on Wednesday a 
statement of the Agrarian Party on the current situation in 
agriculture and plan to do that before a scheduled meeting of 
the president and the prime minister who are to determine the 
new composition of the government. 
  The president and the premier stumbled over the candidacy of 
Finance Minister and Marketeer Boris Fedorov who said he might 
remain in the government only in case Zaveryukha is dismissed. 
  Zaveryukha is responsible for agricultural policy in the 
government.

  [Text] At their session on Wednesday, Duma members intend 
to discuss a temporary statute on their activity and funds to 
ensure it. 
  According to the document, on all matters of their activity 
legislators must be "received without delay by state and local 
administration officials and by factory and office managers." 
They can demand that "any violations of the law, rights, 
freedoms, and legitimate interests of citizens be eliminated, 
and that the officials to whom a lawmaker's demand is addressed 
immediately adopt appropriate actions." 
  A lawmaker's monthly salary will be 90% of what a 
federal 
minister is paid. The Speaker receives 40% above his 
salary 
for chairmanship, and his deputies, committee chairmen and other 
senior Duma officials receive 25% on top of their wages. A 
bonus for "intensive" work done will amount to 50% of a 
legislator's salary. Veterans are entitled to a 40% 
increase to 
their pay. 
  Cabinet members working in the Duma get nothing for their 
parliamentary duties. 
  Legislators are entitled to free travel across Russia by 
plane, train, car, or ship and on all means of public 
transportation, except taxis. 
  A lawmaker should mail letters and telegrams as government 
reports. 
  A Duma member without permanent housing in Moscow gets 
within 
3 months an apartment for residence with his family during his 
time in office. The flat is not subject to privatization. 
  A parliamentarian receives a diplomatic passport to be valid 
for his entire term in the Duma. 
  According to the document, if the Duma is dissolved, its 
members receive allowances for the period before their powers 
expire, based on their monthly salaries. 
  Lawmakers will be allowed to transport property to the place 
of their permanent residence free (containers of up to 10 tons). 
  A legislator can have three assistants, one of them to help 
him in parliament, the others -- in his constituency. The 
assistants have monthly salaries as well.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "Duma Determines Deputies' Pay"] </F>
  [Text] The State Duma began its 19 January morning sitting 
by adopting as a basis the draft decree on ensuring the activity 
of deputies of the Federal Assembly's lower chamber. 
  The document indicates, in particular, that Duma deputies 
must enjoy the right to be immediately received by the leaders 
of organs of power at all levels and are entitled to demand that 
they eliminate violations that have been identified, while for 
their part the leaders of organs of power must eliminate the 
violations. 
  A considerable proportion of the draft decree is devoted to 
questions of material support for legislators. For instance, it 
is proposed to establish for Duma deputies a monthly salary of 
90 percent of a federal minister's salary. That is, around 
270,000 rubles at present. However, additional payments will 
make up for the lag in relation to ministerial pay. All 
deputies will receive presumably monthly a 50-percent additional 
payment "in view of the special nature and intensity of work." 
There will also be additional payments for particular posts. 
The State Duma chairman gets [an additional payment of] 40 
percent of a deputy's salary, and his deputies and the chairmen 
of Duma committees and subcommittees get 25 percent. There is 
also provision for long-service payments -- 40 percent. In 
addition, all deputies are reimbursed for expenses associated 
with legislative activity to the tune of 10 minimum salaries. 
  Duma deputies, like their predecessors, will have free use 
of 
all types of transportation apart from taxis and will have the 
right to get tickets without waiting in line and to wait for the 
required forms of transportation in the former deputies' rooms. 
  Diplomatic passports will be issued to State Duma deputies 
for their entire term of powers. 
  As for housing, the draft decree envisages allocating 
legislators from outside the city official housing within three 
months, but only for the period during which they exercise a 
deputy's powers and without the right of privatization. 
  The document also takes into account the possibility of 
dissolution of the Duma. In this case deputies must be paid a 
one-shot grant for the entire period remaining until the end of 
the term for which they were elected. They must also be granted 
free return to their home and the free shipment of up to 10 
tonnes of baggage. Final adoption of the decree is planned for 
the evening sitting. 
  The main topic of the first half of this Duma workday was 
discussion of the draft decree of the Federal Assembly's lower 
chamber on the plan of legislative work. 
  Overall this day in the State Duma is again going fairly 
quietly. Routine work is proceeding. At the same time State 
Duma security services are tightening security measures since a 
REUTER correspondent was reportedly detained in possession of a 
pistol on the balcony of the Duma meeting hall. Apparently it 
was a gas pistol.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- The first stage of the 
constitutional reform has virtually been completed with the 
adoption of the new constitution. It is necessary now to adopt 
federal laws registering the new political reality in Russia, 
first deputy speaker of the State Duma Mikhail Mityukov said on 
Wednesday. He presented to deputies of the lower chamber of the 
Federal Assembly the plan for Duma's legislative work. 
  Mikhail Mityukov noted the need of consolidating 
legislatively real parliamentarism that is forming in the 
country. It is based on clear separation of power and 
interaction of all branches of power. In this connection it is 
planned to draw up laws that will create a legal base for the 
State Duma of the future convocations. 
  The first deputy speaker of the duma said that the plan 
includes federal constitutional laws, among them the laws on the 
referendum, on the government of the Russian Federation, on the 
judiciary reform in Russia and on the powers, the procedure of 
forming and the activity of the constitutional court of the 
Russian Federation. 
  Mityukov described the present civic code as outdated. He 
said the part of the civic code containing its general 
principles has already been drafted and will be submitted to the 
State Duma. 
  He said the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly is to 
adopt 
new code on taxes, as well as the criminal code, the criminal 
proceedings code, the labour and land codes, as well as the code 
on the family and marriage. The Duma is also to adopt laws on 
political parties and trade unions. A great number of laws 
related to the economic sphere are also to be adopted, Mityukov 
said. 
  Much attention is given to legislative acts whose adoption 
will make it possible to realise complex problems of federalism 
in Russia, Mityukov believes. 
  Mityukov also stressed the need of adopting legislative acts 
in the area of international politics and foreign economic 
activity, including the law on international afgreements. The 
first deputy chairman of the State Duma believes that the plan 
of legislative work stretched far beyond the term of the present 
Duma, so it is necessary to adress priorities. Mityukov said 
the adoption of new laws will promote the policy of reform. In 
this connection he noted that many draft laws being drawn up by 
the former Supreme Soviet were obviously populist and therefore 
inflationary, and that their implementation led to the worsening 
of the economic situation.

  [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- Attempts of some members 
of the Russian State Duma to steer the debate on the draft plan 
for its legislative work into the "political channel" did not 
meet the support of most chamber members. The discussion 
proceeded in a businesslike atmosphere. 
  The deputies, who took the floor during the discussion, 
arrived at the conclusion that the vast legislative programme, 
submitted by People's Deputy Mikhail Mityukov, had to be 
examined in detail and finalised in Duma committees. 
  This refers primarily to the package of economic 
legislations. Deputy Sergey Kalashnikov, moved to hear a 
government report on the concept of the economic reform. He 
claimed that the economic policy, conducted by the cabinet in 
recent years, "completely overlooked the human factor". The 
speaker stressed that "Russia needs workable economic laws that 
will not merely discharge populist functions". In his opinion, 
it is necessary, first and foremost, to map out the main 
directions of the social policy, to elaborate laws on employment 
and on the minimum consumers budget. 
  Deputy Sergey Glazyev moved to discuss primarily the 
presidential decrees submitted to the two chambers of the 
parliament. He stressed the need for clearly determined 
priorities in drawing up legislations. This idea was backed by 
other MPs. Deputy Lyudmila Zavadskaya described as deplorable 
the lot of women and children in Russia. She stressed that 
these problems needed legal regulation. Deputy Nikolay Kotov 
believes that the Duma should adopted first of all laws 
governing the work of the agro-industrial complex, land 
relations, and also the taxation police and social insurance. 
  Deputy Aleksandr Piskunov insisted that questions linked 
with 
the military service and participation of Russian troops in 
peace- keeping actions abroad brooked no delay. Several 
deputies moved to revise the conversion programme, to bring 
legislative acts in line with the new Russian constitution. 
Deputy Viktor Ustinov tabled a motion to elaborate primarily a 
bill on the restoration of the constitutional court.

  [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
refused on Wednesday [19 January] to discuss the statement of 
the agrarian party in which it attacked the financial, 
investment and credit policy of Finance Minister Boris Fedorov 
and former First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar which, it said, 
triggered collapse of agriculture. 
  The Duma said the statement contained "arbitrary and 
subjective assessments of the current situation in agriculture". 
  By proposing the statement the Agrarian Party, evidently, 
wanted to support its leader and Deputy Premier Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha before the president and the prime minister agree on 
the new composition of the government. 
  The president and the premier stumbled over the candidacy of 
Fedorov who said he might remain in the government only in case 
Zaveryukha is dismissed. 
  Zaveryukha is responsible for agricultural policy in the 
government and supports the interests of collective and state 
farms. Fedorov became his arch rival after refusing to provide 
subsidies to state-run agriculture. 
  At the same time the Duma adopted a statement which 
recommended the government to consider in five days the problem 
of financing agriculture in 1994 in order to increase production 
and stabilise its development in conditions of a market economy.

  [Text] At the initiative of the group of Agrarian Party 
deputies, the State Duma has advised the government to adopt a 
decision within the next five days on the functioning of the 
agro-industrial sector during the current year. The resolution 
was adopted by the State Duma after a second vote on this issue, 
taken after Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice group, 
called on his colleagues to approve the document, INTERFAX 
reports. 
  The agrarian group circulated a statement on the state of 
affairs in the agro-industrial sector. This says that the state 
still owes farmers over 1 trillion rubles for produce purchased 
from them, including over 600 billion rubles for grain.

complex under market economy conditions. 
  At the same time the chamber refused even to examine the

subjective, arbitrary assessments of the present situation in 
the agro-industrial complex and claiming that "the state of 
collapse in agro-industrial production is the result of the 
government's incorrect policy with regard to the agrarian sector 
of the economy and the grossest errors and blunders in 
financial, investment, and credit policy."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- The State Duma has made 
quite a good start. The main problems are ahead. They will 
arise during the discussion of draft laws. The division of 
forces in the lower chamber is not yet final. This is the 
opinion of deputies of various political orientation in the 
State Duma, expressed to ITAR-TASS. 
  "The Duma vacillates between utter uncontrollability and too 
rigidly controlled decision-making of heads of groups," believes 
Vasiliy Lipitskiy, head of the People's Party of Free Russia, 
who was elected from a one-seat constituency and who has not 
joined any faction in the Duma. He believes new factions may be 
formed. Many deputies regret that the Duma does not have 
clearly defined centrist forces "which could balance the 
struggle which leads to shaky compromises," he said. 
  Another independent deputy, Irina Hakamada, general 
secretary 
of the Party of Economic Freedom, believes that the forming of 
new groups of deputies is inevitable. The "Union of December 
12" being formed by Hakamada and a number of her supporters will 
soon amass 35 members and will become eligible for registration. 
  She refuted the supposition that the new group will be a 
subsidiary of Russia's Choice bloc. "We are closer to market 
reforms than anybody else, regardless of party affiliations," 
she said. (It should be noted Gaydar said that his group 
discussed more than once reinforcing the Union of December 12 
with members of Russia's Choice bloc). 
  Sergey Baburin, elected from a one-seat constituency, said 
that 17 people so far applied for Russia's Path group that he is 
forming. The group will exist de facto even while not 
registered. He said other people with patriotic leanings are in 
various party factions and in the "New Regional Policy" group. 
Baburin, the leader of the Russian National Alliance, expressed 
dissatisfaction with the fact that "the patriotic forces 
relinquished key committees to Russia's Choice bloc and its 
supporters." Nevertheless he believes there is every chance 
that the Duma will be effective legislatively if it is effective 
politically. 
  "The Duma has shown that it is effective," said Vladimir 
Isakov, elected on the slate of the Agrarian Party of Russia. 
Isakov, who was one of the most remarkable representatives of 
the opposition in the former Supreme Soviet, believes the new 
parliament has been able to avoid the main pitfall, that of 
being bogged down in organisational matters for weeks. He said 
the package vote on the list of deputy speakers and heads of 
committees was a reasonable compromise that made it possible to 
avoid wasting weeks on voting on appointments. 
  Assessing the alignment of forces in the Duma, he said that 
it is split approximately in half with the left opposition 
having a slight edge. Neither of the factions, nor any of the 
sides has a guaranteed majority. So compromises should be 
sought. Extreme decisions will not be passed. 
  Isakov said the main danger is that no decisions will be 
passed on key problems of reform in the lower chamber. "We have 
not yet tackled these matters," he said. 
  There are differences among deputies on the draft laws on 
the 
economy and the question of the media," said Kirill Ignatiyev, 
representative of Russia's Choice faction. He believes the 
structure of the Deputies Corps has already been determined. It 
has two extremist wing (the right wing -- LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] and the left wing -- communists and 
agrarians) and the centre which is formed of Russia's Choice and 
other democratic factions. 
  He said there is no complete unanimity in the centre. 
Russia's Choice, the group of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord and the Union of December 12 mainly vote in the same way, 
while members of Yabloko and the new regional policy group all 
vote differently. 
  Speaking highly of professionalism and proper conduct of 
Speaker of the Duma Ivan Rybkin, Ignatiyev predicted that a 
political alliance of Viktor Chernomyrdin and Ivan Rybkin will 
gradually form. The government without reformers will rely on 
the parliamentary majority which will include the extreme left 
-- communists and agrarians, part of the "New Regional Policy" 
faction and part of the group of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord, he said. 
  Leader of the Democratic Party of Russia group, Nikolay 
Travkin, believes the Duma has a high potential in organising 
itself. He believes this was shown by the fact that it had 
completed the formation of working bodies on the fourth day of 
work. 
  Travkin believes not a single political trend can earn half 
the number of votes. This has a positive aspect as an 
irresponsible decision will not be passed by the Duma in a rush. 
  Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy, representative of Yabloko group 
said the voting on a package in electing the leadership of the 
lower chamber and heads of committees had been an achievement. 
Heated debates in the Duma immediately subsided. People 
realised that there is an opportunity for actual specific work. 
  Shostakovskiy believes that during an intermission of 
plenary 
meetings, when work is conducted in committees, the role of 
factions will decrease for some time. "Nothing could be worse 
than continued political clashes and overly politisation. If 
this were so, it would be an end of Duma, he said. The chief 
task at present is to draw up a programme of the legislative 
activity of the Duma and of each of its committees, 
Shostakovskiy believes.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "The Defense Committee Will </F>
Start Work on Legal Support for Military Doctrine"] 
  [Text] The Defense Committee will start work on legal 
support for the military doctrine. That is, the fact is that 
the package of drafts [narabotki] of the Russian Federation 
Supreme Soviet Committee for Defense and Security Questions and 
of other committees which devoted attention to the Army will be 
set in train. Although corrections are undoubtedly inevitable. 
  Sergey Yushenkov also voiced the hope of close contact with 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense on questions of 
lawmaking. This is necessitated, in particular, by the recently 
adopted military doctrine, which is in need of a "legal 
superstructure." 
  The Duma members spent Tuesday afternoon clearing up 
questions of the standing orders. Once again, just as on the 
previous day, a proposal was made to "set free" Aleksandr 
Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov. Precisely 145 deputies came out 
in favor of including this item on the agenda, with 151 against 
it. The proposal did not pass. Nor did the next one -- to 
examine the reasons for closing down the well known "600 
Seconds" news program. But the Duma members were unanimous on 
the proposed construction of a new parliamentary complex costing 
$500 million -- such costly construction is not timely. Yegor 
Gaydar ("Russia's Choice") and Valentin Kovalev (Communist Party 
of the Russian Federation) made a corresponding statement in the 
lobby, thereby setting an example of factional unity "on 
fundamental issues." It is proposed to resolve the State Duma's 
housing problem by redistributing the capital's administrative 
buildings. 
  In fact, the incident with the parliamentary complex may be 
regarded as the first challenge to the government, as a test of 
the strength of the opposition members' coalition. 
  On Wednesday the Duma members examined and approved the plan 
of the State Duma's law-drafting work. It was proposed and 
defended by Mikhail Mityukov, under whose leadership the plan 
was drawn up in the Legislative Proposals Commission under the 
Russian president.

  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
turned down on Friday a proposal to adopt an official statement 
on the new composition of the government, but agreed to discuss 
the situation in former Yugoslavia and consider the resumption 
of the "Parliament Hour" tv programme which the former 
legislature introduced to advocate its anti-presidential views. 
  The Duma will also consider the composition of the 
geopolitical committee headed by a representative of the party 
of nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. It is the only out 
of 23 committees which the Duma failed to approve on Thursday 
[20 January].

  [Text] The State Duma extended today's agenda at its 
morning session. Lawmakers decided to examine at 14:00 the 
draft of a statement on the situation in the former Yugoslavia. 
  As Speaker Ivan Rybkin announced, a report would be made by 
Sergey Lavrov, a deputy foreign minister since the First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin had not returned from 
Yugoslavia yet. 
  Lawmaker Vyacheslav Marychev (St. Petersburg, the Liberal 
Democratic Party) requested debates on the resumption of the TV 
feature entitled "Parliamentary Hour." His request was met. 
  Marychev criticized media, above all TV, for their coverage 
of Duma discussions. 
  At LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's demand, the Duma will 
return to the issue on the make-up of the parliamentary 
committee on geo-politics. 
  It is the only committee whose composition has not been 
endorsed by the Duma so far. Most legislators are displeased 
with the fact that of the 13 committee members, 9 are LDP 
officials. 
  Lawmakers disapproved a motion to elect a fifth vice-speaker 
from among the members, elected in one-mandate constituencies.

  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- The State Duma (lower 
chamber of the Russian Parliament) adopted the temporary 
regulations on working and living conditions of legislators at 
its morning session on Friday [21 January]. 
  According to the regulations, lawmakers enjoy the right to 
be 
received immediately by heads of government organisations. The 
legislator's ID card is a document granting him the right to 
pass freely to any body of state authority as well as any 
enterprise, office or organisation. 
  Parliamentarians have the right to demand that violations of 
laws, rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of citizens be 
removed without delay. 
  The regulations also say that the lawmaker's monthly cash 
remuneration includes a bonus for special nature and intensity 
of work, a long-service bonus and other bonuses in compliance 
with operating legislation. The lawmaker's monthy salary is 
equal to that of a federal minister. 
  State Duma members struck out an item from the regulations 
today, saying deputies who are members of the federal cabinet, 
may receive their pay envelopes only at the lower chamber. 
  Legislators are entitled to medical and every-day services 
enjoyed by cabinet members. 
  The regulations note that legislators enjoy the right of 
free 
travel by air, rail, road and water in Russia as well as by all 
types of city passenger transport, except taxi. They also have 
the right of obtaining travel documents without waiting. 
  Duma members in the city of Moscow and the Moscow region are 
provided with office cars assigned to them permanently. 
  Lawmakers with no permanent residence in Moscow are provided 
with flats for the term of their work at the Duma. However, 
they cannot be privatised. 
  Pending the receipt of a service flat, the lawmaker is 
provided with a separate hotel suite or, at the legislator's 
wish, cash compensation necesary to conclude a contract for 
hiring a living premise in the amount equivalent to the cost of 
living at a two-room suite of a four-star hotel. 
  The legislator receives a diplomatic passport for the entire 
term of his duties. The deputy is also granted an annual paid 
leave of 48 workdays. He receives an allowance for medical 
treatment amounting to two monthly salaries. 
  To perform their duties, parliamentarians are provided with 
offices at the State Duma building as well as at constituencies 
where they were elected. 
  The lawmaker may have up to five assistants. He 
independently defines the number of his assistants and the size 
of their remuneration within the wage fund for assistants. 
  The Duma also adopted a decision later in the day under 
which 
the Russian Government is instructed to take appropriate 
measures to implement the regulations which come into force 
today.

  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
conveyed wishes of successful work to the state Duma (lower 
chamber of the Russian parliament) at a meeting with him on 
Thursday, state Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin told lawmakers at the 
morning session of the lower house on Friday. 
  Rybkin noted that the president assured legislators that the 
chief executive will give every kind of support to the Duma. 
  Describing the talk with the president as detailed, 
substantive and constructive, Rybkin stressed that Yeltsin 
expressed readiness for constant cooperation with the state 
Duma. Meetings between the Duma speaker and the president will 
be regular, at least once a month. 
  Rybkin informed deputies that the talk focused on 
cooperation 
between the chief executive and the state Duma in law-making 
activities. The president stressed that the division of powers 
does not mean their estrangement, Rybkin said. 
  "We shall be guided by this principle during our work at the 
state Duma," the speaker stressed. 
  According to Rybkin, they also discussed material and 
technical aspects of the state Duma's work as well as working 
and living conditions of legislators. The speaker noted that 
the president reaffirmed: Lawmakers will be provided with all 
necessary things for their work. 
  Rybkin informed deputies that all buildings and services of 
the former parliament will be transferred to the Russian 
parliament fully or for temporary use. The president instructed 
the business administration to hand over all necessary services 
to financial and economic administrations of the Duma. 
  This question was also settled in principle with the Russian 
Government, Rybkin added. He told parliamentarians about his 
two-hour talk with Viktor Chernomyrdin, which was held also on 
Thursday. 
  The premier said that the Duma will receive back the 
institute of comparative jurisprudence, one of the most 
important institutions which will be returned to the lower 
chamber. 
  The question was also raised about completing all repairs at 
the building of the former townhall which is now occupied by the 
state Duma. The president informed the speaker that he gave 
appropriate instructions to the government to complete repairs 
at the earliest. 
  Rybkin also said that the Duma would receive an appropriate 
number of other spacious buildings and installations in the 
capital, although he did not specify which ones. He only noted 
that buildings are good both in floor space and quality and in 
no way inferior to the previous ones. 
  The speaker informed deputies that a working staff of the 
state Duma would be formed. He told lawmakers that the 
president, on his suggestion, signed a decree disbanding the 
temporary staff of the Russian Parliament and establishing a 
permanent staff of the state Duma.

  [Text] Moscow January 24 (TASS) -- A draft resolution of 
the State Duma on declaring an amnesty for some categories of 
prisoners not creating any special danger for society will be 
discussed by the parliamentary committee for legislation and the 
reform of the judicial-legal system, First Deputy Chairman of 
the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly Mikhail Mityukov told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  The draft resolution is being submitted to the State Duma by 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Mityukov pointed out that the draft resolution had not yet 
come to the State Duma and explained that, in accordance with 
Article 103 of the Russian Constitution, the declaration of an 
amnesty is the prerogatve of the State Duma. "Naturally, the 
president has the right to initiate an amnesty act, which means 
that he has the right to submit a draft resolution on this issue 
for the consideration of the parliament's chamber," he said. 
  Mityukov described the mechanism of the discussion of the 
document by the State Duma: after the committee for legislation 
and the reform of the judicial-legal system gives its 
conclusion, the draft resolution will be submitted to the 
chamber's council and after that it will be discussed at a 
plenary session of the State Duma. 
  "It is difficult to forecast the results of the examination 
of the draft resolution by the State Duma, but I think we cannot 
do without a discussion. Important events in the life of the 
country, such as the adoption of a new constitution and major 
anniversaries, have always been accompanied by the declaration 
of an amnesty. The question arises, however, what will be the 
limits of the amnesty," he said. 
  In the opinion of Mityukov, "maximum caution should be 
displayed in such situations, especially taking into 
consideration the current crime situation in conditions of the 
weakened law and order in the country."

<F P=106> [Oksana Petrunko report: "`Party Bosses' Share Everything </F>
Out: Twenty-Three Committees Set Up in State Duma"] 
  [Text] The four deputy chairmen of the Duma represent four 
different factions, and the list of candidates for the posts of 
chairmen and deputy chairmen of Duma commissions was organized 
on the same principle. All these apparatus posts were allocated 
among Russia's Choice, Yabloko [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc], 
the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], the Agrarian Party 
of Russia [APR], the Democratic Party of Russia [DPR], the "New 
Regional Policy" [NRP], the Communists, Zhirinovskiy's 
followers, and the Women of Russia. The Women of Russia have 
obtained the opportunity to chair the Committee for the Affairs 
of Women, the Family, and Childhood. Yabloko occupies the 
leading positions on two committees (but what committees!): The 
Committee for International Affairs (V. Lukin) and the Committee 
for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances (Mikhail Zadornov). 
Aleksey Mikhaylov, who is deputy chairman of the Committee for 
Economic Policy, is also from that bloc. Members of the NRP 
association have become chairmen of three committees. The PRUA 
and APR and the Communists chair two. Russia's Choice has 
chairmen on four committees, including defense (Sergey 
Yushenkov) and information policy and communications (Mikhail 
Poltoranin). However, the makeup of their deputy chairmen -- 
that is to say, Communists and deputies from the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] and APR -- raise doubts about 
the strength of Russia's Choice on those committees. The LDPR 
has installed chairmen on five committees. 
  A proposal to vote for each committee individually did not 
find support. However, the ritual of candidates presenting 
themselves and their programs did begin. I think it is a great 
pity that television is not broadcasting the sessions of 
parliament now. The election of the State Duma apparatus 
promised to be instructive as regards the candidates' character 
and potential. Sergey Glazyev (chairman of the Committee for 
Economic Policy, DPR) was single-minded and businesslike. 
Mikhail Lemeshev (LDPR) was approved as chairman of the 
Committee for the Environment in his absence. Vladimir Isakov 
(APR), chairman of the Committee for Legislation and Judicial 
and Legal Reform, proposed creating the "most sophisticated 
system of legislation in the world" through computerization. 
You will recall that not so long ago there was half-joking 
discussion of whether the stress on the first syllable of 
"nachat" ["to begin"] will become the norm. Lyubov Rozhkova 
(NRP), chairman of the Committee for Education, Culture, and 
Science, launched a new philological tendency: Quoting 
Franklin, she twice referred confidently to him as Veniamin. 
And, admittedly, Fedor Roosevelt and Misha Faraday might well 
extend the bounds of Russian knowledge, might they not? 
  Eight potential committee chairmen spoke that day. The 
pointless procedure was cut short by a deputy's address: "The 
'party bosses' have already shared everything out, that's enough 
time wasted, let's vote." And voting did take place, 
demonstrating once again that every opportunity for independent 
deputies to influence the work of the committees has been 
removed.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1315 GMT on 19 January broadcasts an interview with Sergey 
Nikolayevich Yushenkov, head of the parliamentary defense 
committee, by an unidentified correspondent. During the 
interview Yushenkov is asked to describe the committee he heads. 
He says that currently 18 people representing various parties 
are on the committee, almost all of them with military 
experience. Among them, he says, are Aleksandr Aleksandrovich 
Piskunov, one of the leaders of the former Supreme Soviet's 
defence and security committee, Colonel General Yuriy 
Nikolayevich Rodionov, former deputy defense minister and 
currently deputy chief of the Armed Forces Inspectorate, Colonel 
General Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov, and Georgiy Grigorovich 
Lukava. The committee's main task, according to Yushenkov, is 
to "restore officers' prestige" with particular reference to 
restoring the role of the Russian officer and gentleman. He 
adds that welfare issues, military doctrine, and army reform are 
among other questions the committee wishes to deal with, 
ensuring that the army is "on a proper level of combat 
readiness." 
  Yushenkov then lists other committees headed by Russia's 
Choice members. 
  Commenting on the fact that some government members have 
decided to focus on their Duma duties, Yushenkov says it will 
affect the work in the new parliament: Democrats have about 
one-third of the votes, or perhaps a little more. About 40 to 
42 percent of deputies oppose the president and the government, 
he says, adding that "the battle now will be for those who are 
undecided." Those who succeed in enticing them will probably 
get majority in the State Duma, "although it seems to me that 
not a single competing group will get a stable majority," 
Yushenkov says. He goes on: "As for members of the government 
leaving the government, it is due to the fact that it is not 
possible to continue with effective reforms. Moreover, since 
mid-December Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov have, in fact, been 
unable to influence the financial stabilization, nor have they 
been able to influence in any effective manner any other 
decisions connected with the economic or welfare sphere and that 
is the reason why they left that government, together with Ella 
Panfilova and this will, of course, make itself felt on the work 
of the State Duma." Gaydar, he says, will now be a more active 
participant in parliamentary proceedings -- yesterday he was 
applauded for opposing the squandering of taxpayers' money on 
the building of new premises for the Federal Assembly. 
  Yushenkov concludes his interviewe by noting: "I think that 
the truth that the center of power is currently being shifted in 
the structures of executive authority from the president to the 
prime minister is becoming more and more obvious -- it is a fact 
which must be taken into account in further activities."

  [Text] The State Duma members will spend this week in their 
constituencies while chairmen of parliamentary committees will 
recruit staff, obtain premises and install telephones, computers 
and faxes in them. 
  In particular, the Security Committee has no premises or 
telephone number, its Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin told Interfax. 
  The Legislation Committee has to draft a plan of legislative 
activities for the Duma and will have no recess. 
  Vladimir Isakov, its chairman, told Interfax Monday that the 
State Duma deputies had significantly amended the plan that had 
been submitted by the legislative commission of the president's 
office and the two plans had to be reconciled. 
  The Information Politics and Communication Committee chaired 
by Mikhail Poltoranin has to report on the state-controlled mass 
media, in particular television coverage of parliament 
activities. 
  Numerous deputies, notably the liberal democratic group,

of authorities can be achieved by a law now being drafted by the 
legislative commission of the president's office.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Karpov article under the "Power" rubric: "Duma and </F>
Russian Federation Foreign Policy. It Will Not be Very Simple 
for Yeltsin and Kozyrev To Continue Their Course"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation foreign minister does not 
tire of reiterating that Russia's foreign policy is that of the 
president. This postulate, however, does not appear all that 
self- evident now that Duma committees have been formed. At 
least four of them -- on international affairs, CIS affairs, and 
geopolitical questions -- may, and more probable than not, will, 
insist on at least having their opinion be considered. The 
latter committee will go the longest way of all. At least 
because its head and one of his deputies -- Viktor Ustinov and 
Mikhail Sidorov -- are representatives of the Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia, and this party, perhaps, did not indicate any 
agreement on a single question with the Yeltsin-Kozyrev foreign 
political course. It is maintained that the very creation of 
the committee on geopolitical questions is a payback to the 
Liberal Democratic Party for the foreign affairs committee 
chaired by Vladimir Lukin, former Russian Federation ambassador 
to the United States. But he too has a Liberal Democratic 
"shadow foreign minister" for his deputy, Aleksey Mitrofanov. 
  Lukin, however, is known for his strained relations with 
Kozyrev which may undoubtedly negatively rub off on the 
committee's reactions to the actions of the minister who, as 
Kozyrev himself maintains, is strictly following the president's 
policy. But Russian parliaments traditionally do not do what 
the president says and the Duma has no special grounds to alter 
the ingrained habit. 
  The committee for security is led by Viktor Ilyukhin, a 
Communist prosecutor, who was going to take Mikhail Gorbachev to 
court, hence one should not expect any special cooperation. All 
the more so because the committee chairman will, one would 
think, find support from one of his deputies, Nina Krivelskaya, 
representing this same Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. 
  There are no representatives of the Russian Federation 
Communist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia among 
the leaders of the fourth committee, for CIS affairs. But they 
are undoubtedly to be found among its members. Indeed, 
relations with the "near abroad" are of real interest for these 
parties, and their view on these relations once again diverge 
from those of Yeltsin and Kozyrev. 
  Thus, all the prerequisites are there for a more clearly 
defined standoff between the Duma and the president, and his 
foreign minister, in virtually all areas of foreign policy. The 
parliamentary committee will surely approach geopolitical 
questions from neo-imperial positions, something that its 
chairman's deputies, Yuliy Gusman of Russia's Choice and Aleksey 
Piskunov of New Regional Policy, would hardly countervail. 
  One does not have to explain the way the Communists see 
Russia's security, and this approach means opposing all 
disarmament processes and initiatives. One should also remember 
that Ilyukhin was going to take Gorbachev to court for the 
disintegration of the USSR; consequently he has a corresponding 
attitude to the CIS and Russia's partners that augurs nothing 
good. It may hamper all efforts by Zatulin's committee. 
  Kozyrev has always been accused of pro-Americanism. The same 
can easily be ascribed to Lukin for his ambassadorial past. 
Demagogues have never passed up such a chance, and I do not 
have to remind you whose ranks are chock full of them. 
Apparently, no foreign policy question is going to be perused 
solely by one certain committee. Each committee will try to have 
its say on a matter, which would spark differences between them. 
It would be sensible for Yeltsin and Kozyrev to play on these 
differences if only they pay attention to the voice of 
parliament at all. There is a third option -- to adjust the 
Russian foreign policy course taking into account 
parliamentarians' opinions. But then it may radically alter the 
course itself. That would have very serious consequences both 
for Russia and the world.

Russian Christian Democratic Party; Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman 
of the Russian Federation Republican Party and member of the 
"Yabloko" faction; and Gleb Yakunin, cochairman of Democratic 
Russia: "Party Leaders on State Duma's Work"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Chuyev, chairman of the Russian 
Christian Democratic Party Political Council 
  [ROSSIYA] Did your party contest the elections? 
  [Chuyev] Of course. We nominated 108 candidates, but the 
Central Electoral Commission ruled that we did not collect the 
100,000 votes in our support required for registering our bloc, 
although we disagree with that. Yevgeniy Fedorov, our candidate 
from Leningrad Oblast, was elected in a one-mandate district, 
and another two deputies, who were elected as independents, have 
raised the question of joining our party. For us, the elections 
continue. I personally and another two representatives of the 
Russian Christian Democratic Party are running for the 
Federation Council in Chelyabinsk Oblast. In addition, we will 
participate in municipal elections in Moscow. We hope that two 
or three of our candidates will make it. 
  [ROSSIYA] Which faction at the State Duma will express your 
interests? 
  [Chuyev] Hard to say, but definitely not "Russia's Choice." 
In all likelihood, it will be a faction of independent deputies, 
because there are people there who sympathize with us. We may 
also form our own group there. There are deputies whose views 
are close to ours in the Russian Democratic Reform Movement and 
in Sergey Shakhray's Party for Russian Unity and Accord. 
  [ROSSIYA] What do you think about the State Duma's future? 
  [Chuyev] Unfortunately, it will be even less effective than 
the previous one. All decisions will be blocked by large 
factions. 
<H3>  Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman of the Russian Federation 
Republican Party and member of the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" 
faction </H3>
  [ROSSIYA] From the first day, everyone has been urging 
constructive work at the State Duma. How real is that? 
  [Lysenko] Given the list of demands published in SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA by opposition electoral blocs requesting that the 
Belovezhskaya Forest agreement be abrogated, the president's 
actions in September-October be deemed as criminal, the results 
of the vote on the Constitution be reviewed, and so forth, this 
is an unlikely prospect. Large blocs are politicized 
throughout, and they are intent on achieving their own 
objectives. Zhirinovskiy is dreaming about the presidency, and 
the communists will try to deal the final blow to Yeltsin and 
the current government lineup. They will try to force a vote on 
starting an impeachment procedure against the president, because 
in this case the latter will not have the right to dissolve the 
State Duma. Here a dramatic tug-of-war may break out. Either 
Yeltsin will manage to dissolve the Duma on the basis of Article 
111, or it will demand impeachment. My fears may not 
materialize, however, because the interests of Zhirinovskiy and 
the communists do not fully coincide. 
  [ROSSIYA] Does your organization have a package of 
legislative initiatives? 
  [Lysenko] So far we have not been able to agree one page of 
our political statement. It concerns the Constitution. Some 
argue that it should be accepted as a political reality, while 
others demand that we should go to court so that it will rule 
its adoption as unlawful. On other matters we are unanimous. 
We oppose the commissions about which I spoke earlier. We 
believe that we should deal with the rules of procedure and with 
committees. 
  [ROSSIYA] Will your faction be able to preserve itself? 
  [Lysenko] Everything will depend on whether the faction will 
pay heed to the parties on whose bandwagons these deputies 
entered the Duma. 
<H3>  Gleb Yakunin, cochairman of the Democratic Russia movement 
and member of the "Russia's Choice" faction </H3>
  [ROSSIYA] How do you assess the future of the State Duma? 
  [Yakunin] I think it will be ineffective owing to 
substantial political differences. It will hold on for hardly a 
year. But at least it must resolve the fundamental question -- 
to demystify Zhirinovskiy's party and the man himself. To show 
the people that they made a mistake in electing him. To 
demystify his team made up of state security and Main 
Intelligence Administration officers and so forth. I think that 
Lukyanov and Kryuchkov must shed light on the subject.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, head of the State Duma </F>
International Affairs Committee and a leader of the "Yabloko" 
bloc, by Vladimir Mikheyev, date and place not given: "Vladimir 
Lukin: I Know What Must Be Done But I Do Not Know Where"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Lukin is head of the State Duma 
International Affairs Committee and a leader of the Yabloko 
bloc. He preferred the parliamentary platform in the "house on 
the embankment" to his former residence as Russian ambassador in 
Washington. 
  "According to standing orders the committee must consist of 
at least 12 people and at most 35 and must be formed on the 
basis of the proportional representation of the factions. In my 
view this principle is important, but it must be combined with 
the deputies' professional qualities," Vladimir Lukin replied in 
an interview for IZVESTIYA. 
  [Mikheyev] Presumably, Ambartsumov, Adamishin, and Sheynis 
have a good chance of a place on the committee. They are all on 
the Yabloko faction's list. 
  Opinions of them may vary but they are eminent specialists 
in 
international relations, Lukin noted. 
  [Mikheyev] Asked the other day whom you would like to see as 
your successor in Washington, you virtually repeated the 
aphorism that "the most important thing is that it is a good 
man".... 
  [Lukin] In the term "a good man" I include a combination of 
professionalism and ethical norms. 
  [Mikheyev] Will you find a place on your committee for 
Deputy Kozyrev? 
  [Lukin] Ministers do not take part in the work of 
committees, in my opinion this will be stipulated in the 
standing orders. But if he prefers to concentrate on work in 
parliament, then why not? He is a professional. 
  [Mikheyev] How will your work be organized? 
  [Lukin] We do not have the conditions to satisfy even our 
most minimal requirements in this building. We do not have the 
premises. 
  [Mikheyev] Do you intend waiting until parliament's $500 
million "castle in the air" is built? 
  [Lukin] Why? To put it mildly, this solution is untimely. 
But since the Constitution proposes that we have a working 
parliament it is necessary to create the conditions for it. My 
view is that for a committee chairman a car is not a luxury but 
an essential means of transport. As for salary, there are 
rumors that everyone will be paid the same, from the chairman of 
the Duma to the deputy chairman of a committee. I do not know 
what the figure is. 
  [Mikheyev] The impression created is that you still do not 
feel that you have special powers, that you have the reins of 
power in your hands.... 
  [Lukin] In my opinion, the whole Duma does not have the 
reins of power. I know what must be done but I do not know 
where. 
  [Mikheyev] What do you, as chairman of the foreign affairs 
committee, see as the priorities of Russia's foreign policy? 
  [Lukin] At a time of crisis Russia's foreign policy must 
ensure every condition possible for overcoming the crisis. 
There is the creation of a favorable export climate. The rate 
of the ruble against the dollar is falling, it cannot be 
stopped, at least not long term, by financial manipulations; 
consequently it is necessary to export, it is necessary to earn 
hard currency. At the summit, for example, progress was made on 
the sale of Russian uranium to the United States -- we must 
continue in that vein. 
  Another area is to ensure the physical security of Russia 
and 
its citizens by diplomatic and economic methods so as not to 
have to resort to other methods. That is connected with the 
former Union republics. 
  [Mikheyev] Is there a complete coincidence of views between 
you and President Yeltsin? 
  [Lukin] I have never had disagreements with the president on 
foreign policy. I have been asked how I regard the "new 
thinking," to which I replied -- I do not know of any "new 
thinking." There is only right thinking or wrong thinking. The 
right thinking amounts to defending our national interests, 
which precludes two methods. The first is offering tender 
kisses and one-sided concessions. The second is howling and 
barking like a dog, which unites everyone in a coalition against 
us.

<F P=106> [Sergey Parkhomenko report: "Union of Offenders Against the </F>
Residency Qualification"] 
  [Text] As things stood yesterday evening, the organizers 
of the independent Duma group "Union of 12 December" were short, 
as Deputy Andrey Makarov stated, of the consent of five 
colleagues to clear the margin (35 members) established by 
parliamentary rules to get the new association officially 
registered. There is almost no doubt that the masterminds of 
the "Union..." -- deputies Aleksandr Braginskiy, Irina 
Khakamada, and the already mentioned Mr. Makarov -- who had 
managed, in less than a week's time, to double the number of 
their supporters, will successfully clear this last hurdle as 
well. Already now they hold 22 applications from deputies who 
intend to join their group, and eight verbal assurances from 
colleagues who are ready to write such application "even today." 
  True, deputies Braginskiy and Khakamada had to approach 
nearly all the existing factions: starting from Russia's 
Choice, they turned in sequence to the leaders of Yabloko, the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the Democratic Party of 
Russia, and finally Vladimir Medvedev's New Regional Policy with 
a request to delegate voluntarily their supporters to the new 
group. Let us note that their efforts met with the least 
understanding precisely in Russia's Choice, and it is from there 
that a considerable number of deputies finally fled to 
Khakamada's colors. 
  The greatest sensation among such deserters was produced by 
Boris Fedorov, who was absolutely enraged -- as one can conclude 
from the series of interviews he gave on Sunday and Monday -- at 
the fact that Yegor Gaydar's decision to renounce participation 
in the new government had been preceded by consultations with 
all sorts of people rather than with the closest cabinet 
associate. As is known, Choice paved the way to parliament for 
this same Makarov or, say, Mikhail Kisilev, who told journalists 
yesterday he was changing his faction allegiance. 
  It is enough to state even these samples: "Russia's Choice 
has passed up the chance to create a `satellite faction' linked 
to it by strict and long-term commitments of joint activities in 
parliament. The "Union of 12 December" is now being born 
despite, rather than thanks, to it. The good-natured parting 
words like Yegor Gaydar's phrase, "We have nothing against the 
new faction, and will obviously form a block in a friendly 
manner with them," appear belated and not quite sincere. 
Essentially, though, leaders of "Choice" should not have 
special reasons for fears: it is not Communists, really and 
truly, that Choice will have to take cues from in important 
voting. 
  One must assume that the skeptical attitude by the leaders 
of 
Choice to the efforts of Mr. Braginskiy and Mrs. Khakamada was 
based, it is easy to guess, on the unpleasant memories of the 
cruel scandal thrown at them by a group of supporters in the 
course of the famous conference at "Lesnyye Dali" [holiday spot 
near Moscow] shortly before the opening of the Duma session. 
Several recent members of the movement's Executive Committee 
spoke at that time against appointing Yegor Gaydar head of the 
faction, and supported the candidature of Gennadiy Burbulis. 
Mr. Burbulis for that matter preferred to be shy and say 
nothing, and Andrey Makarov led the riot. 
  It is not surprising that, getting the wind of the latter's 
efforts (which had been carefully concealed by him until 
recently) to split off some deputies from the "maternal 
faction," observers were awaiting a statement from Mr. Burbulis 
on supporting this initiative and maybe on taking over the 
functions of leader of the "allies." But on reflection, the 
splitters finally convinced each other that it is not quite 
decent for deputies elected on party lists to violate the 
political residency qualification by so quickly and easily going 
back on their election commitments. This triumph for common 
sense was helped by, among other things, fears of the Duma's 
impending approval of a law on deputy status: no potential 
defector is guaranteed that the law would not incorporate a norm 
on the automatic transfer of the seat of a deputy showing a bent 
for disorderly political contacts to the candidate next on the 
party list. 
  Formulating, so far unofficially, the position of their 
group, organizers of the "Union of 12 December" are speaking 
especially often about their disagreement with the creation of 
what Mrs. Khakamada described as "Duma politburo," in the shape 
of the council of the leaders of factions and the already 
elected chairman of the chamber. "The agreement on the 
inadmissibility of whatever compacts with the Communists and the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has been broken by the heads 
of Choice," stated Deputy Makarov in an interview for SEGODNYA. 
"The package agreement on electing leaders of the Duma and of 
its committees has become a model of bargaining in a situation 
where all bargaining is out of place. The genius to strike 
bargains has been shown in the most graphic manner by Mikhail 
Poltoranin, who received direct powers to do that from Gaydar 
himself.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Oleg Velichko and Anna </F>
Melnikova] 
  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- Leader of the Yavlinskiy- 
Boldyrev-Lukin faction and economist Grigory Yavlinskiy 
suggested a program of emergency measures against the inflation 
and production recession at a news conference at the State Duma 
today. 
  He informed correspondents of a forecast, according to which 
the inflation may run out of control by fall 1994 to reach 50 
per cent and the production recession may be equal to 52 per 
cent of the 1989 level. 1989 was the last year of production 
increase. 
  Speaking of priority measures against the inflation, namely 
a 
possibility to control the inflation at a level of 20 per cent 
in 1994, Grigory Yavlinskiy stressed the need to bring the 
dollar exchange rate in correspondence with the inflation 
dynamics. He said the government should be responsible for the 
exchange rate dynamics, which means the soonest conclusion of 
futures deals on sales of hard currency at a certain exchange 
rate. 
  The economist warned the government against the policy of 
easy- term credits and direct subsidies. He said they should 
immediately lower the interest rate under administrative 
regulation of the credit amount. 
  Another priority is crucial changes of a policy on benefits 
for exporters. He said Russia cannot allow hard currency to 
flow abroad. He said 15 billion dollars flew abroad in 1993 
alone. 
  He offered the government to cancel the tax on exchange rate 
difference and said everyone having hard currency accounts 
should not pay for the inflation, for which they carry no direct 
responsibility. Yavlinskiy said the cancellation of this tax 
may help to prevent money outflow. 
  The economist suggested to free statistics bodies from 
government control. 
  Yavlinskiy told ITAR-TASS his faction is ready to form a 
government capable of fulfilling this program within eight to 
nine months.

  [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- The Liberal Democratic 
Party of Ultra-Nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, which won 
elections to the new Russian legislature on a party list, failed 
to enjoy the same success in one-seat constituencies and thus 
became the third strongest faction in the lower chamber, 
according to information made public in the Duma on Wednesday. 
  It registered 63 lawmakers and Sergey Churkin is the 
secretary of the faction. 
  The Russia's Choice and the faction of independent lawmakers 
overtook Zhirinovskiy. 
  The Russia's Choice has registered 76 lawmakers headed by 
Sergey Yushchenkov, while the independents united in the "New 
Regional Policy" faction with 65 seats and Gennadiy Kalistratov 
as the coordinator. 
  The Agrarian Party is the fourth in the list with 57 
lawmakers headed by Secretary Nikolay Kharitonov. 
  The Communists come fifth with 45 seats, the Party of 
Russian 
Unity and Accord has 30 lawmakers, the Yabloko Bloc of Grigory 
Yavlinsky - 27, the "Women of Russia" - 23 and the last is the 
Democratic Party with 15 seats.
