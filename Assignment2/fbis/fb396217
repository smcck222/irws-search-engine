<F P=106> [Vladimir Isakov "Parliamentary Diary" article: "They Want </F>
To Sneak Around the Back..."] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Duma dealt with fairly 
mundane questions in its first week, but anybody who follows 
parliamentary life will be aware of their importance. When 
beginning the work of a newly elected organ, it is, of course, 
necessary to agree on a quorum. Views, naturally, differed. 
"Russia's Choice" insisted on a two-thirds quorum, and moreover 
demonstrated on the very first day that it intends to use the 
"right of the minority" to disrupt sittings. The other side 
proposed that the quorum be set at 50 percent of the deputies, 
as this will render the work of the Duma more stable regardless 
of the changing moods of deputies and factions. The majority of 
votes was cast in favor of the second option. 
  The next question derives from the very same series: Which 
should be the base number to calculate the majority of votes 
required to adopt a decision? There would seem to be nothing to 
debate here -- the majority should be calculated on the basis of 
the number of deputies actually elected to the Duma (444 
people). But there are those who, referring to the Constitution, 
demanded that six non-elected "dead souls" also be added to 
this. The discussion was so tricky that even "Russia's Choice" 
was split over it and failed to arrive at a unified opinion. 
But again, common sense prevailed -- the Duma finally voted to 
calculate the majority on the basis of the number of deputies 
actually elected. 
  During the very first sittings, as if on a photographic 
plate, a polarization of the deputies' corps became evident. 
When one part of the hall applauds and rises to its feet, the 
other remains sullenly silent. And vice versa. It is somewhat 
disconcerting to see the entire right-wing sector of the hall 
react gleefully to inaccuracies and blunders, and rejoice when a 
decision is thwarted for whatever reasons. There is no 
"constructive collaboration" in that.... A parliament in which 
they do not have a guaranteed majority is no good to them. So 
from the outset the task has been to disrupt and to wreck. 
Future developments are easy to predict: After waiting a short 
while, the faithful hounds from the mass media will be let 
loose, and then the issue of dissolution "in view of the 
opposition to the president" will be raised everywhere. 
  Basic decency has already been abandoned in the "democratic 
press" even today. The president is being urged to "demonstrate 
firmness" and to put pressure on parliament (it has to be 
assumed that hitherto he has demonstrated extreme lenience.) He 
is urged not to give the deputies apartments (let them live in a 
hotel for two years), and to restrict their travel 
opportunities. There is open rejoicing at the impotence of a 
parliament from which all premises have been confiscated and all 
backup services withdrawn. 
  Matters are taken even further by Mr. Shumeyko, who, as the 
elected speaker of the Federation Council, at his first press 
conference declared a readiness to divide and isolate the State 
Duma in the event of "dire need": "It is possible to cooperate 
with those deputies of the Duma who are indeed concerned about 
the state, and adopt laws directly here." (That is, in the 
Federation Council, bypassing the State Duma.) It is no secret 
to Mr. Shumeyko that "this will be a certain violation of the 
Constitution." But if something is really wanted...it is even 
possible to violate the Constitution. So you see the type of 
authority which has been nurtured -- it will not be hampered by 
a mere Constitution [ni v odnu konstitutsiyu ne vlazit]! 
  There is never a right time for disease and death. So it is 
that Ye. Gaydar chose not Saturday, and not Monday, but Sunday 
for his resignation announcement. Moreover, it is easy to 
understand why. Saturday was too early -- the "big chief" from 
Washington had not yet departed. And the composition of the new 
Cabinet of Ministers was expected to be announced Monday. After 
this, who needs your "resignation announcements"! 
  Of course, the surprise announcement by the "father" of the 
Gaydar reforms, Mr. Ye. Gaydar, will generate, has indeed 
already generated, a mass of conjecture and commentary. But two 
assumptions are self-evident, and they can be expressed without 
fear of serious error. 
  The first is that Ye. Gaydar "and Co." leave the government 
at a time when dense dark storm clouds are already gathering on 
the economic horizon. Now is the time to abandon the bridge of 
the unreliable government ship. At the same time, with the very 
same childish directness with which under Chernomyrdin they once 
swore "terrifying oaths" of loyalty to reforms, they bequeath 
the reforms to the government, having finally thrown the 
contents of the slops bucket over them. 
  Second: Gaydar and his team are freeing their hands for the 
next presidential elections, at which they intend to emerge, 
like Aphrodite from the foaming sea, in all the radiance of 
untainted cleanliness: "Here we are, elect us!" 
  But every cloud has a silver lining. It will be useful for 
Gaydar to sit on the opposition bench in order to experience the 
full measure of insolence and extreme contempt with which the 
government meets any proposals and initiatives emanating from 
parliament. He will rewarded according to his deeds. We will 
see what happens after that. 
  Let us return to the parliamentary hall for a while. In the 
opening days, the issue of the type of ballot -- open or secret 
-- was the subject of fierce debate. Parliament's "democratic" 
part was all but foaming at the mouth in its attempts to prove 
that a secret ballot on any subject and as frequently as 
possible is a commitment to democracy, and the most important 
guarantee of the defense of the rights of the minority. 
  It is funny. I have as yet been unable to forget the time, 
three years ago, when it was proven with equal fervor that the 
most important guarantee of minority rights is the roll-call 
ballot, whereas the secret ballot was exposed as anathema, as 
cowardice, as a desire to conceal one's position from voters. 
Which is why it was enshrined in Supreme Soviet standing orders 
that the roll-call ballot may be used at the behest of one-fifth 
of the deputies, but on no occasion can the secret ballot be 
resurrected. 
  Why this U-turn? Least of all do I suspect my opponents of a 
lapse of memory or defective logic. If concepts are turned 
upside down, then it is probably for a reason. Maybe people are 
sick of publicity. And maybe there is some basis to the rumor 
that a "second key" has been fitted to the electronic ballot 
system, and that during a secret ballot (which by its very 
nature is impossible to verify) it brings about the required 
result.... 
  It is exasperating to talk about this, but falsehood, 
deceit, 
and the desire to "sneak round the back" were brought into play 
from the very first days of parliamentary practice. It is 
normal and natural for people to adhere to different views. But 
can it be considered normal when an "extra" paragraph suddenly 
appears in an agreed document, and it just happens to be about a 
secret ballot at the behest of one-fifth of the deputies? When 
a respected professor and jurist known to the whole country, 
upon glimpsing into the hall, sees no raised hands, and hears no 
words of appeal addressed to him? And when there is a shortfall 
of just one vote to adopt the decision.... I cannot agree that 
politics is a dirty game. The dirt is brought into it by people 
-- through their conciliation, their lack of principle, their 
readiness to achieve aims by any means. 
  In mainstream politics, the stakes are always high. It gives 
rise to a conflict of interests, frank and human passions, and 
it creates a very strong field of force, which masterfully 
arranges people along their invisible lines. In mainstream 
politics, there is always temptation -- the ceiling of legal and 
moral requirements is lowered a little, deceit is answered with 
deceit, meanness with meanness, lawlessness with even greater 
lawlessness. And it is easy to jump back and forth across the 
barrier, to achieve victory. Behind an easy victory follows the 
next phase -- "the final dash," when a subdued opponent is 
hunted down without any rules whatever. Then comes the 
celebration, the apotheosis of a victory which "will wipe the 
slate clean," burying the unsightly "details" beneath the waves 
of the general fever of the victors. Open baseness wears a mask 
of dignity, violence sets itself up as nobility, and falsehood 
preaches honesty. The phony carnival of an unjust victory.... 
  Today, truth and honesty are on the side of the "left-wing" 
opposition. The sympathies and hopes of the honest, thinking, 
and feeling part of society turn to it. This is a great 
strength but also a great responsibility. These hopes must not 
be betrayed.

<F P=106> [Article by Georgiy Satarov: "Pie of Power Already Feasted </F>
On..."] 
  [Text] So the State Duma deputies have spent exactly a 
week dividing up the pie of internal power. Two trends emerged 
at the very start of the session: The first was that the 
deputies were in no hurry to embark on a fierce political battle 
for the redistribution of power with the president and the 
government, but, on the other hand, they were making 
preparations, by arranging their Duma life in detail; the second 
was that on day one, without any preliminary maneuvers, the 
deputies launched into votes enabling them to determine the 
internal disposition of forces, since the size of everyone's 
slice of the pie depended on this to a large extent. 
  The first controversy was over two digits in the text of the 
provisional standing orders indicating the minimum permissible 
size of a faction. The communists, agrarians, DPR [Democratic 
Party of Russia], and LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
wanted the number 50, and their reason for that was a desire for 
organized and efficient work. The opposing flank and 
"independent" deputies insisted on a threshold of 14 deputies, 
advocating "freedom of association." In actual fact, there were 
two things here of great importance to the division of power. 
First, it was necessary to block the possible multiplication 
(including by means of division) of factions on the other 
political flank, which is important because of the natural 
factional representation norm both in the debates and in the 
various Duma components. 
  Second, combined with the obligatory order, which is 
intended 
to be enshrined later in the Law on the Status of Deputy and 
which involves strict factional discipline, the high threshold 
made it possible to form a strategic majority on the left flank. 
As a result of a two-sitting struggle and a series of votes a 
compromise figure of 35 deputies was reached as the basis for 
forming new groups and factions. It is interesting that it was 
when this matter was being discussed that the "main forces" 
started to come to the microphones. 
  There followed an equally fierce battle over other standing 
order norms of vital importance. In this case the left flank of 
the Duma succeeded in gaining powerful positions by passing 
norms whereby the quorum for opening a sitting was reduced to 
one-half of the total number of deputies, and this total number 
corresponds to the number of elected deputies. In the votes on 
these questions the deputies were obviously haunted by the 
specter of the Supreme Soviet. 
  The deputies' love of Aesopian language was most fully 
manifested in the discussion of two versions of the article in 
the standing orders determining the mechanism for the election 
of the Duma chairman. According to the first version, proposed 
by the standing orders group, the chairman would be elected by 
two rounds of secret votes; the two candidates who had obtained 
the most votes would reach the second round -- a natural, 
generally accepted norm. 
  According to the second version, sponsored by the left wing, 
a straw poll would be carried out electronically. The reason 
for this was that it would be a high-speed operation. In fact, 
this mechanism would enable the very slightly larger left wing 
to block the passage of candidates from the opposing flank or 
center to the second round, which was successfully accomplished. 
As a result, I. Rybkin, who overcame Yu. Vlasov in the second 
round, won by a majority of half a vote in excess of one-half of 
the total number of deputies, since one of the ballot papers 
caused arguments in the tellers' commission amd its fate was 
decided by the Duma. 
  The initial days of the lower chamber's work revealed the 
disposition of forces to come, which had been predicted earlier 
and which is characterized by powerful flanks and a weak center. 
  On the left flank you have the coordinated bloc of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF] (45 deputies, 
which was the figure given in the official registration in the 
Duma 12 January) and the Agrarian Party of Russia [APR] (55). 
On a number of questions they are joined by the Liberal 
Democratic Party (63), the Democratic Party of Russia (15), 
"Women of Russia" (23), and several independent deputies, some 
of whom had gotten together in the "Russian Path" association 
headed by Baburin, Lukyanov, and Vlasov, which has not been 
registered yet because it does not have enough deputies 
(approximately 20 deputies). 
  The CPRF, APR, LDPR, amd DPR form the tactical nucleus of 
this grouping. What distinguishes all their actions is the 
amount of thought that goes into them and the high degree of 
preparation. The actions of their speakers and supporting 
deputies in the chamber are well organized. All this, creating, 
as it does, an atmosphere of confidence in their own strength, 
attracts to this grouping the votes of some wavering deputies 
amd enables them as a result to obtain in the Duma the votes of 
a small majority of the number of elected deputies. 
  On the opposing flank you have the fragmented "Russia's 
Choice" (76), the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" bloc (25), the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] (30 deputies, including 
the newly joined independents), and the unregistered "Union of 
12 December" group of democratically oriented deputies, which 
has I. Khakamada as one of its leaders (around 20 deputies). 
  These factions are not organized and they are not 
coordinated, their preparations are poor, and their proposals 
suffer from poor reasoning. A typical example is the 
explanation that a quorum of one-half of the deputies is 
insuitable because it would lead to the adoption of laws by 
one-fourth of the deputies' votes. This logic was a gift for 
the communists, who made sure they took advantage of it by 
immediately reminding their opponents that that was precisely 
how the Constitution was adopted. It is not inconceivable that 
this false move might have influenced the outcome of the vote on 
this question. 
  We can confidently assign the "New Regional Policy" 
deputies' 
associaiton (65 deputies), headed by V.S. Medvedev, president of 
the Oil Workers' Union, to the central part of the spectrum in 
the Duma. Medvedev was one of the contenders for the post of 
State Duma chairman and got 145 votes in the straw poll. 
  Further events confirmed the instability of this structure 
in 
which neither flank has a sure tactical majority. This was 
manifested in a series of votes on the agenda, in which the 
proposals from the extreme left flank "to get to grips with the 
press," "free political prisoners," and so on did not get 
through. Which explains the desire of the majority of deputies 
to resolve the question of the distribution of committee posts 
as a single "package," on the basis of accords on the 
proportional allocation of seats, which was successfully 
implemented. 
  This could mean that the Duma has a certain constructive 
potential, which will be confirmed or refuted in the very near 
future. It must be added that, unlike the Supreme Soviet in the 
final months, where there was an atmosphere of bitter animosity, 
the atmosphere in the Duma in the initial days was that of a 
jolly sports festival. The first chairman, G. Lukava, had a lot 
to do with that. 
  Having sorted out the seats, the deputies will busy 
themselves with the standing orders and the Law on the Status of 
Deputy. Then we should see the start of the regular legislative 
work, primarily, one assumes, on federal constitutional laws. 
It is not inconceivable that in the interim the Duma will try 
to creep up on another pie of power, not in the Duma, but 
outside -- in the state. What form this takes and what the 
results are will make it possible to answer many questions 
concerning the fate both of the authorities and of the state.

<F P=106> [Leonid Nikitinskiy article: "The Dilemma of the Speaker </F>
and the Enterprise Chief -- Federation Council Entices State 
Duma Along `Soviet Path of Development'"] 
  [Text] Having very promptly ratified the allocation of the 
posts of vice speaker and committee chairmen in the State Duma 
"as a package," the deputies demonstrated a fundamental capacity 
for agreement. 
  Clearly an important precedent has been set, and henceforth 
the majority of the most fundamental questions, including those 
linked with legislative work, will be resolved in the State Duma 
in a similar comprehensive manner. In this case the deciding 
factor determining the content of decisions will be the "weight" 
of the factions holding the preliminary consultations. 
  Now the main internal drama in the general development of 
the 
Duma will consist in the factions' battle to preserve and 
increase their size, insofar as it is the number of votes which 
a faction has at its disposal on each specific question which 
will determine its capacity within a specific bloc to influence 
its ultimate solution. 
  By definition, there can be no objection to political 
methods 
of struggle for votes on the part of factions: This is the 
normal mode of operation for a parliament. At the same time, 
apart from political means, apparatus means, which are 
concentrated in the hands of elected leaders (as we have already 
observed in the example of Khasbulatov's Supreme Soviet), may 
also be drawn into this battle. 
  In principle it is possible to entice deputies both by 
creating and distributing material privileges, and by creating 
advantages in work, including information advantages. For 
instance, Vladimir Isakov, who heads the key Legislation 
Committee in the Duma, can organize its work in such a way as to 
afford any deputy equal access to draft laws, or he can create 
effective advantages for members of factions close to him while 
impeding access to information for "outsiders." 
  In his election speech to deputies, and later in his 
"inauguration speech" to journalists, State Duma Chairman Ivan 
Rybkin stressed that he will try not to reveal his own political 
partialities in the post of speaker. He will deserve a medal if 
he manages to resist the temptations facing him and the pressure 
which will certainly be put on him, but the strength of such 
temptations goes without saying. 
  Meanwhile, Vladimir Shumeyko, his colleague from the "House 
of Lords," has demonstrated quite frankly that he does not 
intend to ignore apparatus methods of struggling for influence 
over members of the Federation Council. This has already been 
demonstrated in the story of his election, in which backstage 
talks with regional leaders played a significant role. And one 
of Shumeyko's first steps in his new post, according to 
information from well informed sources, was an appeal to the 
president to review his earlier guideline on creating a unified 
Federal Assembly apparatus. 
  At present this apparatus serves both chambers. Since 
according to the Constitution the main concern of the Federation 
Council is to be to approve (or reject) laws adopted by the 
State Duma, it can hardly be deemed useful or efficient to 
establish for the two chambers two completely autonomous 
bureaucratic apparatuses including duplicate expert departments, 
information services, libraries and codification departments, 
personnel departments, and, of course, economic administrations 
in charge of official apartments and dachas, cars, and luncheon 
vouchers. 
  On the other hand, the whole of Soviet history is in fact a 
history of the transformation of control over the apparatus into 
supreme state power and of the absorption by the apparatus 
branch of power of all the other traditional "branches," and in 
Soviet history purely distributive, bureaucratic functions 
triumphantly dominate legislative, executive, and judicial 
functions. Of course, it is difficult for Vladimir Shumeyko and 
other leaders who passed through the Soviet apparatus school to 
renounce this means of holding sway and these stereotypes. 
  In the light of such demands already stated by the 
Federation 
Council, the State Duma simply has no option but to put forward 
similar demands and to set about the de facto division of the 
unified Federal Assembly apparatus which has only just been 
hastily set up, beginning with the unique body of experts and 
ending with the auto mechanics. The first round of rivalry 
between the chambers for possession of the apparatus will 
probably lead to rivalry between the parallel apparatuses that 
are set up, and a war between the apparatuses may serve as one 
reason for a future war between the chambers. 
  Since the proposal on division is directed to the president, 
let's look at the situation as if through his eyes, or rather, 
the eyes this time of the presidential apparatus. On the one 
hand, "divide and rule" is an old apparatus principle proven 
throughout the centuries, and there is a not unfounded 
assumption that the initiative for division emanates not so much 
from Shumeyko as from the presidential administration. On the 
other hand, the presidential administration, which still retains 
the ability to monitor compliance with proprieties in a unified 
Federal Assembly apparatus to some extent, will probably lose 
this ability in the event of division. 
  This option for the organizational structure does, of 
course, 
have its advantages, which are that deputies will be more 
independent of the whims of the presidential administration. 
But as payment for this independence, they will immediately 
become dependent on their chambers' divided apparatuses, and 
this is clearly capable of inflicting significantly greater 
damage on the normal legislative process. At the same time, 
this will mean that Russians' longstanding dream of a civilized 
parliamentary speaker who merely chairs sittings neutrally and 
properly and is relieved of any kind of tiresome organizational 
or economic hassle can be written off. However great the desire 
of Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin in particular to distance himself 
from intrigues and politicking, he will inevitably be drawn into 
this by the apparatus that clings to him -- it is beyond the 
strength of any human being to resist this on one front while 
simultaneously resisting political pressure from his own faction 
on a second front. 
  It is unlikely that the deputies will want to heed the 
advice 
of journalists, but it seems to me that the most sensible thing 
for both chambers would be to decline to have their own 
individual apparatus and to leave the solution of the bulk of 
organizational, information, economic, and purely everyday 
problems to representatives of the presidential administration 
monitored by them. There are also significant inconveniences 
and obvious risks in this, but at the same time it is, in my 
view, the only way to guard against the apparatus-distributive 
virus.

  [Text] At a press conference held today, Latvian President 
Guntis Ulmanis announced that his telephone conversation on 
Thursday with U.S. President Bill Clinton allows him to conclude 
that Moscow and Washington have no secret agreements that could 
threaten Latvia's sovereignty. 
  The U.S. President, in his 30-minute telephone conversation, 
emphasized that the issues of human rights and citizenship are 
not linked to the issue of the withdrawal of Russian troops. 
The United States, since the incident in Latvia on 10 January 
and the events connected with it, has not changed its stance on 
the issue of the withdrawal of Russian troops and believes that 
the issue of human rights and citizenship is to be settled by 
the Latvian state itself, stressed Guntis Ulmanis. 
  Bill Clinton also informed Ulmanis about his visit to Moscow 
last week. The U.S. President discussed with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin the issue of the Skrunda radar station. Clinton 
recommended continuing talks at the level of the government 
commissions on this issue and seeking a compromise solution.

  [Text] In Riga today, Alain Lamassoure, minister delegate 
of European affairs at the French Foreign Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, offered Latvia several proposals for tackling issues of 
national security. One of the proposals is joining Balladur's 
plan, or the European stability pact, the draft of which was 
worked out by the French premier. 
  This plan envisages joint discussion and tackling of various 
conflicts and problems between neighboring countries. It is 
planned in the draft to pay particular attention to problems 
which occur in relations between small countries and neighboring 
great powers. 
  France will also assist Latvia in joining the European 
Union. 
An agreement is currently being worked out between the European 
Union and Latvia, and France wishes that the agreement will also 
have a political significance and make it possible for Latvia to 
become a member state of the European Union in the future. 
  In addition, Lamassoure said that France supports the 
concept 
of Latvia joining the West European Union as an associate member. 
  The Partnership for Peace cooperation program offered by 
NATO 
would also help to tackle the issues of Latvian security. As 
Lamassoure said, an agreement is currently being prepared 
between Latvia and France on cooperation in defense issues. The 
agreement provides for training of Latvian military experts in 
France. Both countries have already coordinated all the 
political aspects of the agreement and it could be signed in the 
near future.

  [Excerpt] President Guntis Ulmanis received a delegation 
headed by Alain Lamassoure, minister delegate of European 
affairs of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in his 
residence at Jurmala yesterday. 
  Looking at the sea through a window of the meeting hall, Mr. 
Lamassoure said that the seascape reminded him of the Atlantic 
coast of France. There the sea is rough but the land tranquil. 
Here the sea is calm but the land restless. Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur has therefore asked him to visit the Baltic 
states in precisely this situation which has evolved after the 
elections in Russia. The elections brought about insecurity, to 
a certain extent even threats to the Baltic states, therefore, 
(?the minister said), France expresses support for Latvia. 
  Speaking about relations with the European Union, Alain 
Lamassoure stressed that France and Germany are in favor of 
Latvia becoming an associate member of that organization. He 
indicated that France fully supports Latvia's demand for the 
unconditional withdrawal of the Russian army, because Latvia is 
a sovereign state. 
  An acceptable timescale should be laid down for the 
dismantling of the Skrunda radar station; this has nothing to do 
with the Russian community in Latvia. 
  President Guntis Ulmanis emphasized the security issue in 
Latvia and all the Baltic states, which has come to the fore due 
to the events of recent days. (?Therefore), the cooperation 
which has already started with France is of special significance 
for strengthening the Latvian defense forces. 
  Alain Lamassoure reported that he will confer with the 
French 
defense minister within the next few days to prepare a document 
for signing on cooperation between the two countries in the 
sphere of defense. 
  Speaking about the NATO Partnership for Peace plan and 
Latvia's involvement in this program, the minister noted that 
for countries which are not NATO member states this offers the 
possibility for obtaining new security guarantees. 
  Touching on the issue of minorities, the French minister 
stressed that if the Latvian Government relies on 
recommendations made by the CSCE, France will be able to render 
more palpable support. 
  At the end of the meeting the president recalled that France 
has not yet resolved the issue of the Latvian Embassy. The 
minister replied that action would begin quite soon to get out 
of the deadlock. 
  Alain Lamassoure handed to Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs a letter from French Prime Minister Eduard Balladur with 
an invitation to visit the French capital in the near future. 
During the talks Mr. Birkavs stressed that Latvian security has 
become the main priority of state policy and expressed support 
for the draft of the European stability pact worked out by the 
French prime minister. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Riga, January 19 (LETA) -- According to the 
Ministers Cabinet Press Service, Tuesday [18 January] the 
Latvian Prime Minister, Valdis Birkavs, and the Ambassador of 
Chile, Karlos Parra, discussed the possibilities for development 
in cooperation between both countries. Birkavs considers it is 
time to launch economic ties between Latvia and Chile. The 
sides are unanimous it is of special importance to enhance trade 
between the two countries. Nowadays, the volume of goods 
imported from Latvia by Chile comprises only 4,000 lats. The 
ambassador sees good possibilities to more extensive bilateral 
trade in the fact that Latvia has a large trade fleet, while 
Chile produces relatively cheap goods. Birkavs, in turn, 
proposed that work be started on providing the economic ties of 
both countries with a legal basis, reviewing agreements on 
investment protection and on avoiding double taxation. Latvia 
would be the first country to have an agreement with this South 
American country on avoiding double taxation. Birkavs and Parra 
view the exchange with high-ranking delegations as the important 
contribution to the cooperation between Latvia and Chile. 
  Birkavs also proposed the information exchange on the reform 
process, stressing that Latvia wishes to know the way success in 
economic reforms was achieved in Chile. 
  Parra, in his turn, called the experts in forestry and sea 
economy of Latvia to join launching the projects dealing with 
the research carried out in these branches in Chile.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 21, BNS -- Latvian lawmakers rejected the 
Cabinet's Jan. 11 regulations on counterintelligence, thus 
approving the National Independence Movement's proposal. 
  The other 37 resolutions, which the government accepted in 
between the parliament sessions, were sent for consideration to 
the Saeima (parliament) standing committees. 
  The rejected rule stipulated the setup of 
counterintelligence 
services to prognosticate, monitor and neutralize any danger to 
the national security. The services were also designed to 
gather information on concrete candidates for important 
government posts. 
  A heated debate arose when considering the Cabinet 
resolutions on the Riga local government and the amendments to 
the law on the status of a local deputy. 
  As reported, the government adopted these norms Jan. 10 
after 
the conflict between local authorities and Russian officers. 
The rules allow for dismissing any local government head who 
repeatedly fails to observe laws or Cabinet resolutions. 
  The norms are inconsistent with the principles of a 
rule-of-law state, according to which an elected person is 
dismissed only by a court ruling, said Maris Budovskis, of the 
National Independence Movement faction. 
  If the Saeima had rejected the resolution, Andrejs Rucs, the 
fired Vidzeme district head, should have been restored in office.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 21, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) adopted the 1994 budget plan Thursday [20 January] 
after its first reading. 
  The plan was endorsed by the ruling Latvia's Way - Farmers' 
Union coalition, the Concord for Latvia faction, the Democratic 
Party faction and the Equality of Rights (Lidztiesiba) faction. 
  The Latvian National Independence Movement faction, the 
Homeland and Freedom, and the Christian Democrats Union 
factions, however, proposed to postpone the approvement until 
the draft's "conceptual re-arrangement." 
  The budget lacks clearcut concepts for the defense sphere 
and 
the local administration, said Alexander Kirsteins of the 
Independence Movement. 
  The government adjusted the planned incomes to the 
chaotically developing economy, said Equality of Rights' Larisa 
Lavina, who objected to the plan's economic motivation. 
  On the other hand, the budget plan duly reflects "the budget 
of a small, economically haphazard country" that earns almost 
nothing from industry and foreign investments, said Concord's 
leader Edvins Kide. 
  The debate corresponded to the general world practice -- the 
ruling coalition tried to persuade the critical opposition into 
approving a project, said Andrejs Pantelejevs, the head of the 
Latvia's Way faction.

  [Text] According to the Latvian Statistics Committee, 
Russia continues to remain the country's leading trade partner. 
  Over the first 11 months, Latvia imported from Russia goods 
worth 160.3 mln [million] lats, i.e. 28.4 percent of the 
country's overall imports. Latvia's other major trade partners 
are Germany (57.3 mln lats, or 10.2 percent share in overall 
imports), Lithuania (55.6 mln lats, or 9.9 percent) and Sweden 
(30.9 mln lats, or 5.5 percent). 
  Last year, Russia was also the major importer of Latvian 
goods which totalled 182.2 mln lats, or 29.5 percent of the 
country's overall exports. Exports to the Netherlands made 54 
mln lats and to Sweden and Germany -- 41.2 mln lats each. 
  A considerable share of Latvian imports, a total of 44.8 
percent, involves energy and fuel resources, while the bulk of 
exported commodities deals with goods produced outside Latvia, 
for example, oil products, the export volume of which accounted 
for 14 percent over 11 months of 1993. Timber and timber 
products made 8.7 percent of Latvia's overall exports.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 19, BNS -- The Latvian Cabinet passed 
regulations Tuesday [18 January] imposing an import duty on all 
foreign-made goods, Finance Minister Uldis Osis told reporters. 
  The resolution replaces the earlier order that allowed to 
waive import duties on certain categories of goods. The duty 
will vary from 15 percent to 20 percent depending on whether the 
exporter country has a free trade agreement with Latvia, Osis 
said. 
  The lowest tariff is levied on raw materials, which are 
being 
brought in to supply the local industry. 
  Imported products that can be made on the spot will be taxed 
45 percent, Osis said. 
  The tariffs are tailored to protect the domestic market, the 
minister noted. Simultaneously, Osis conceded, the tariffs 
increase alone is unable to protect the Latvian market. Latvia 
should also improve the tax collection mechanism and customs 
control, he said. 
  The new tariffs take effect 30 days after their publication 
in the LATVIJAS VESTNESIS newspaper. 
  In other actions, the Cabinet gave the go-ahead for the 
liquidation of a series of profitless state-run enterprises and 
adopted the order for repayment of excise taxes on diesel fuel, 
which were earlier paid by Latvian farmers in accordance with an 
erroneous government resolution.

  [Text] Boris Fedorov has been continuing as finance 
minister, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told 
journalists in Vnukovo-2 Airport before flying to Orel, a 
regional capital in Central Russia. He said he had accepted 
Fedorov's resignation and this matter would be decided by 
President Yeltsin. 
  The prime minister also said that he had conferred with the 
head of state for 30 minutes Monday morning discussing the 
budget draft for the first quarter of the year. He explained 
that he had never had and would not have "any differences with 
the president and never intended to pass the buck to him." 
  Answering an Interfax question, Chernomyrdin denied press 
reports that he had invited Professor Leonid Abalkin, an 
authority in economics, to work as his adviser. He said, 
however, that he wanted to have a closer look at what each of 
his advisers was doing. 
  Chernomyrdin promised that the government would pay its 
debts 
to farmers but emphasized that this had to be done "in a 
reasonable way and the cabinet does not intend to grant credits 
easily." 
  Chernomyrdin said his government would stick to its policy 
of 
reform, "but the time has come when, in addition to monetarist 
ways of solving economic problems, non-monetarist methods should 
be used, too." There is, for example, one mechanism that has 
never been used previously -- "agreements between the 
government, trade unions and producers on the pricing of output 
and on setting the levels of wages for a certain period," he 
said. 
  He said the present tough credit and financial policy would 
be continued. 
  Commenting on the future monetary union between Russia and 
Belarus, the prime minister said not enough preparation work had 
yet been done for the relevant documents to be signed. He said 
he would certainly visit Minsk. "The hullabaloo over relations 
with Belarus" is "harmful and totally wrong," he said. "They 
want to pull us further away from each other, but they won't 
manage to," he said. 
  Chernomyrdin said Russia would remain loyal to the CIS 
economic union treaty. "Nothing has ever been done or will ever 
be done at the expense of Russia and the Russians, or at the 
expense of Belarus, Kazakhstan, or Ukraine," he said.

  [Text] As INTERFAX has learned from a reliable source, 
Finance Minister Boris Fedorov and the "Interprivatization Fund" 
president Vladimir Shcherbakov had a meeting in the first half 
of the day on Monday. A 45-year-old economist and first deputy 
prime minister in the former USSR cabinet, Shcherbakov has 
lately been favored as the possible new finance minister. 
  According to unconfirmed reports, the two men agreed that 
since the financial situation in the country "is extremely 
tense," a finance minister should also be a first deputy prime 
minister. 
  Shcherbakov is reported to have been trying to persuade 
Fedorov to drop his tough demands on the cabinet's makeup and 
stay in the government.

  [Text] No matter who is put in charge of the Finance 
Ministry, collapse is inevitable given the present mood of the 
government. This view was expressed to journalists by the former 
Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, who is a member of the State 
Duma. He said it would be best if one of his deputies were to 
be appointed acting minister. Fedorov believes that such a 
person would be able, within certain limits, to keep the ship on 
course. At the same time he disclosed that two or three of his 
deputies and several departmental heads intend to leave the 
Finance Ministry in the near future.

  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- Boris Fedorov, who has 
resigned as finance minister from the Russian Government, denied 
mass media reports that he is seeking a job in an influential 
foreign organisation. 
  He told TASS on Friday that a publication of the British 
"GUARDIAN" newspaper which claimed that he had asked US 
Ambassador in Russia Thomas Pickering to find a job for him in 
an influential international organisation was a "provocation". 
  "I have not been in the US Embassy for several months and I 
was not even present at the meeting with US President Bill 
Clinton in Spaso House on December 14 although I was invited to 
it", Fedorov said. 
  He added that he would now focus on his work as State Duma 
deputy to draft lawbills boosting reforms.

  [Text] Russian Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays said 
that whether Finance Minister Boris Fedorov would remain in the 
government depended on whether the Central Bank was headed by 
Viktor Gerashchenko. 
  "A Gerashchenko-Fedorov tandem is something that cannot 
exist 
in the Russian economy today," Chubays, who also heads the State 
Property Committee, said at a conference in Moscow on Thursday. 
But he said it was essential that Fedorov should stay in the 
government, because "losing him would be a heavy blow to the 
reforms and the Russian financial policy." 
  The government's composition will most likely be approved on 
January 21, Chubays said. 
  He said that, as long as the government was headed by 
Chernomyrdin, the basic privatization principles would not be 
changed. "Too much has already been done in the field of 
privatization, and the State Duma, even if anti-government 
sentiments get the upper hand in it, will have to realize it. 
If I remain in the government in my present capacity, no 
alignment of forces will be able to stop privatization," he said. 
  To date between 45 and 50 percent of the state property has 
been privatized, Chubays said. This includes 70 percent of 
service industry enterprises with staffs of under 200. Of the 
14,500 large industrial enterprises subject to 
denationalization, 11,000 have already been privatized. Over 
110 Mn Russians have already used their privatization checks, 
half of which have been exchanged for shares in state 
enterprises, Chubays said.

work in 1994. 
  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin who chaired the session 
said the Government will hold sessions more often in 1994 and 
expressed the confidence that the reduction of the Government 
and the ministries by 20 per cent will not affect the quality of 
their work. 
  He paid special attention to relations between the 
Government 
and the Federal Assembly. Chernomyrdin stressed that "the 
Government should learn to build its work with the Federation 
Council and the State Duma on a new basis. We need to develop 
close and business-like interaction. There should be no 
confrontation because we have common interests." 
  Commenting on the work of the Government, former first 
vice-prime minister Yegor Gaydar said that the faction of the 
Russia's Choice bloc is in "constructive opposition to the 
Government and will support any of its constructive 
initiatives." At the same time his faction plans to argue all 
decisions which it will consider wrong or dangerous for Russia. 
Gaydar voiced the hope that the work of the new Government will 
be successful and it will solve the existing problems. 
  His colleague, deputy Gennadiy Burbulis believes that the 
present composition of the Government "has resources and the 
country has specialists to continue the course of reforms." As 
for the strategy of reform, he said it "is in jeopardy, although 
not in a fatal one." 
  "The present government has more people knowledgeable about 
the economic mechanism which should be rebuilt," Nikolay 
Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, said. He 
said the new cabinet is more capable and suits Russia better 
than the previous one. He believes the Government will have to 
"feel the manufacturers's interest to work more effectively" and 
should reconsider the tax, credit and some other of its policies. 
  Yabloko leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy proposed his own 
programme 
of urgent measures to curb inflation and stop production 
decline. According to his "optimistic forecast," inflation may 
get out of control by the fall and surge to 50 per cent, while 
production decline will total 52 per cent of the 1989 level. 
The year 1989 was the last year to see production growth. 
  Yavlinskiy said his faction is ready to form a government 
capable of carrying out the proposed programme within eight to 
nine months. Among top priority measures aimed at maintaining 
inflation at 20 per cent in 1994, the economist named the need 
to bring the dollar exchange rate in line with inflation 
dynamics. To this end, the "government should take the 
responsibility for the dynamics of the dollar exchange rate. 
This means the need to conclude today a futures deal to sell 
hard currency at a certain rate." 
  Another important measure is a "radical change of the policy 
of privileges for exporters." It will aim at keeping hard 
currency reserves within the country, he said. 
  "The present government will not make quick successes," 
Vladimir Lukin, one of the leaders of the Yabloko bloc, said. 
  Lukin believes that the cabinet should prioritise measures 
aimed at fighting crime in the country. "Without the struggle 
against the criminalisation of all spheres of life it will be 
impossible to build a normal market system," he added. 
  Speaking about the composition of the new government, Lukin 
noted that Chernomyrdin can act as its leader because he has 
supported major reform initiatives of the previous governments. 
"There should be only one leader bearing responsibility for the 
adopted programme. This is vital for the success of the entire 
government," Lukin said. 
  Georgiy Satarov, a top adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, 
believes that the course of reform should not be linked to 
individual members of the government. In an interview with 
ITAR-TASS, he recalled that "over the eight months of 1993 when 
the cabinet of Viktor Chernomyrdin worked without Yegor Gaydar 
there had been no considerable backtracking from the 
anti-inflationary policy." He warned against making "dramatic 
forecasts" and called for assessing the situation by the changes 
the Government makes in the reform programme. 
  Economist Pavel Bunich, a member of the Russia's Choice 
bloc, 
said the formation of the new Government marks "the decline in 
the vector of economic reform." he described the current period 
as a period of temporary appeasement connected with the 
formation of the president-premier-Federal-Assembly-chairmen 
axis. When inflation begins soaring, attempts will resume to 
find a scapegoat. The parliament will blame the Government. 
The president will do the same. This may lead to a situation 
in which the cabinet may become incapable. At present, the 
situation in the Government will depend on the prime minister's 
behaviour, he concluded. 
  Former finance minister Boris Fedorov who resigned this week 
said he will focus his work in the State Duma on lawmaking in 
order to push reform forward. He described as a "provocation" a 
publication in the British newspaper GUARDIAN which claimed that 
he had allegedly requested the U.S. ambassador to Russia to help 
him get a job in some influential international organisation. 
Fedorov told ITAR-TASS that he "has not been in the American 
Embassy for several months." 
  Vladimir Shcherbakov has denied reports that he has been 
offered the post of finance minister to replace Fedorov. "I 
have not received an official offer," Shcherbakov, who heads the 
international fund supporting privatisation and foreign 
investments, said.

  [Text] By all accounts, Yuriy Yarov will retain the post 
of vice premier in the new government, Valeriy Vorontsov, the 
vice premier's adviser, has told ITAR-TASS. 
  He explained that Yuriy Yarov will continue to manage the 
social sphere for the government. Furthermore, he added, the 
vice premier will also be responsible for questions of the 
Cabinet's current work. Let us recall here that Yuriy Yarov is 
chairman of the Commission for the Burial of the Remains of the 
Tsar's Family and is also responsible for commemorating the date 
of the siege of Leningrad. However, the vice premier's adviser 
noted, the management of the Ministry of Health will in all 
likelihood be transferred to the control of First Vice Premier 
Oleg Soskovets.

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, speaking 
at the first session of his new cabinet on Friday, said it would 
meet more often, possibly twice a week, now that it was trimmed 
down, government spokesman Valentin Sergeyev told reporters. 
  The Prime Minister stressed that although the new government 
was cut by 20 percent, this will not affect its performance 
because of the professional skills of its members. 
  He told senior cabinet members that the government must 
build 
its relations with the Federal Assembly on the basis of 
cooperation, given that the cabinet and parliament were being 
led by "common state interests." 
  Chernomyrdin had accepted a proposal made at the session of 
the State Duma that the government should make weekly reports in 
the house. In his view, the prime minister or his deputies do 
not have to appear regularly in parliament but cabinet members 
and ministers must keep in permanent touch with the deputies. 
  Chernomyrdin stressed in particular that members of the 
reformed cabinet should not pay much attention to forecasts of 
"how long it will last, given that the present government is 
quite viable". 
  It was decided that the government would meet in a full 
session on February 17, with President Yeltsin possibly 
attending it. 
  Chernomyrdin warned the ministries and departments against 
any excessive spending while forming this year's budget.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] As Russia's new government set down to work on 
Friday, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was speaking in an 
exclusive interview with INTERFAX News Agency. 
  IF: How did you get on with the President while discussing 
the make up of a new cabinet? Is it possible to speak in terms 
of a "government crisis?" 
  CHERNOMYRDIN: To start with your second question, I think it 
is not at all serious to talk of a government crisis as such. 
Of course, in a society as divided and turbulent as ours is 
there are forces seeking to sow the seeds of chaos and panic so 
as to fish in troubled waters. 
  But all of it is simpler than that in reality. Under the 
country's new constitution, the Prime Minister submits a list of 
cabinet members to the head of state. Naturally, the President 
and I had to discuss at length both the key cabinet figures and 
a new government team as a whole, but there is nothing unusual 
about that. 
  As in any team, there is a clash of interests in a 
government. So we tried to pick up a team of the like-minded 
individuals. I hope I have managed to do so after all. To 
offset any speculations about the new government's make up, I 
would like to say this: I myself am to work with these people, 
not someone else, so I will be personally responsible for my 
choice. 
  Of course, my consultations with Boris Yeltsin were far from 
smooth but we had both sought the same goal: to create a team of 
professionals seeking to update the country through reforms. 
  IF: Much was said about incompatible differences during the 
latest cabinet shake up. What is the cause and substance of 
those differences if there were any? 
  CHERNOMYRDIN: To begin with, there have always been 
differences and no one tried to hide them. On the contrary, 
there was much said and written about them, that the divisions 
on ways of embracing reforms had deepened. But all of this is 
in the past. 
  But I think it is more important to realize one thing: the 
country, the society and economy are in a difficult period of 
transition and each stage has its own logic and priorities. 
  The time has now come to focus attention on curbing 
production slump in all economic sectors as the only way to 
resolve the gamut of social problems facing the country. 
  What sort of reforms or democracy can one talk about at a 
time when huge enterprises and private businesses come to a 
standstill while coal miners, oil workers, doctors and 
journalists go on strike? When private farmers, cooperatives 
and state farms are starved of cash to buy equipment, fuel, 
fertilizers and cornseed in the run up to this year's sowing 
campaign? 
  No matter how progressive, theory as such cannot salvage a 
huge country from shortages of food, energy and commodities and 
by definition, from social upheavals which will make the reforms 
next to impossible. If we fail to boost up production, we will 
fail to salvage the newly-emerging market economy. This is an 
axiom. 
  IF: Don't you think that a cabinet must be made up of people 
upholding different views on the direction of reforms? 
  CHERNOMYRDIN: A government called upon to run a huge country 
at a hard time such as the present is not a debating society. 
This is obvious. 
  There is no time for "flash in the pan"-style discussions. I 
prefer a team of the like-minded individuals, which is alone 
capable of acting with a fair amount of efficiency. 
  But this does not mean we are against any sensible 
opposition 
provided it offers its own cure for the problem. More 
importantly, we prefer precisely this style of work. Some 
observers try in vain to suggest that Chernomyrdin had 
ostensibly formed a government of silent consensus. This is not 
true and I hope the country will be able to ascertain this in 
the next few months. 
  IF: Do you think the latest shake up will lead to some 
corrections in the pace of reforms? If so, what changes are 
likely to be made? 
  CHERNOMYRDIN: It seems we have been carried away too far 
with putting labels on leading politicians such as reformist 
democrats or hardline upholders of the state planning and so on. 
This leads to a situation when the role of a personality is 
blown out of proportion. 
  It is clear to all and sundry that the reform is past the 
point of no return. The main task now is to try to enforce 
reforms with the least possible sacrifice for the society, each 
individual and each household. There is no tragedy if one 
government member is replaced by another. This is a normal 
process. Besides, we would not take up the job if we were 
uncertain about our ability to halt the production slump. There 
is an abundance of those who criticize us but not many who are 
prepared to do the daily work, something that we are ready to 
cope with it. 
  IF: The new government is widely described as being made up 
of a managerial corps lacking an explicit macroeconomic policy. 
Does the cap fit? 
  CHERNOMYRDIN: I do want to deprive those cap passers of 
their daily bread though some of their descriptions are far from 
being decent at times. Perhaps, it would be more correct to 
describe the new cabinet as a team of pragmatists aiming to 
fulfil concrete tasks. But it would be absolutely wrong to say 
we are out to throw macroeconomic approaches overboard. The 
government is not alone, it leans upon an enormous scientific 
basis and experts of world renown. This means, we will be able 
to co-relate global issues with the solving of day-to-day tasks 
without which the country will not be able to survive. 
  IF: In what way do you think the emergence of a new 
government will affect Russia's relations with international 
financial institutions and the problem of the country's foreign 
debt? 
  CHERNOMYRDIN: I state with full responsibility that new 
government appointments will in no way affect Russia's 
obligations to its foreign partners. Russia will continue to 
service its debt in line with the conditions and schedule set by 
the IMF, the World Bank and other financial structures of the 
West. 
  The same applies to our commitments in respect of separate 
countries. Our partners should not have even the slightest 
cause for concern. 
  Russia's policy on this remains unchanged and does not 
depend 
on separate cabinet members. President Yeltsin himself acts as 
guarantor of this. 
  IF: What do you make of a sharp fall in the ruble rate in 
the past few days? 
  CHERNOMYRDIN: I think it must be clear to all by now that 
the setback earlier this week had nothing to do either with the 
economic situation or government actions. 
  The ruble gained somewhat on Thursday which indicates that 
the panic caused by a government reshuffle is now subsiding. 
The banks' behavior at the currency market also indicate that 
panic buying of the dollar was artificial because of being 
caused by irresponsible statements by some of the government 
staff members.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Jan -- "Throughout his term in office as 
leader of the Cabinet of Ministers, Viktor Chernomyrdin has not 
used the services of foreign advisors, and neither does he now", 
ITAR-TASS was told today by the head of the Russian Government's 
press service, Valentin Sergeyev. He had been asked about the 
reaction of the head of the government to a letter from 
economists Anders Oslund (Sweden) and Jeffrey Sachs (United 
States) in which they decline "to further assist the Russian 
Government". 
  According to Sergeyev, the head of the government believes 
that "the mechanical transfer of western economic methods to 
Russian soil has caused much more harm than good". 
  "The reform course drawn up by the Russian Government and 
approved by the president naturally incorporates some elements 
of Western market economics, but it primarily takes account of 
particular features of our state and people and of traditions in 
Russia", Valentin Sergeyev concluded.

  [Text] President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin 
had a meeting in the Kremlin on Monday. As a presidential 
spokesman told INTERFAX, the meeting was not planned. 
  Although he declined to say what the two leaders had 
discussed, he suggested that they had continued to examine the 
problems related to cabinet reorganization. 
  He said that the unexpected flow of criticism to the 
government reshuffle had been staggering for them in many ways. 
So they might have made a new attempt to choose a new finance 
minister and possibly reach a compromise with Fedorov. 
  As for the recent speculations about the possible 
appointment 
to the post of finance minister of ex-USSR premier Scherbakov, 
the spokesman described them "as an attempt to sound out the 
president and the prime minister on this candidate."

  [Text] Representatives of the Democratic Russia Movement 
[DRM] ended a meeting in Moscow on Saturday [22 January] by 
expressing "anxiety and concern" over the President's 
endorsement of a new government which they described as "an 
incomprehensible step". 
  Their appeal to Yeltsin says that unlike Belarus, Ukraine 
and 
Uzbekistan and other republics of the former Soviet Union, 
Russia has acquired steady reformists such Yegor Gaydar, 
Anatoliy Chubays and Boris Fedorov due to your personal 
involvement. The DRM is now puzzled over Yeltsin's support to 
the upholders of the idea of "squeezing" members of the 
reformist wing out of the government to please "red" monopoly 
directors with Viktor Chernomyrdin in charge. DRM leaders accuse 
Yeltsin of backing up what is in essence is a new "Soviet 
government". 
  Participants in the meeting reminded Yeltsin of his verbal 
commitment to "the policy of radical reforms" he had expressed 
at a recent news conference during U.S. president Bill Clinton's 
visit to Moscow. However, they said, Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin announcing the make up of a new cabinet "made it 
clear the pattern of reforms would be corrected". 
  DRM has warned Yeltsin of intending to put up resistance to 
the new economic policy leading to the winding up of reforms. 
  The appeal ends with a question to the President: "What is 
your own policy, Boris Nikolayevich?"

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1350 GMT on 19 January carries recorded remarks by Russian 
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin from an interview with 
Radio Rossii. The place and date of the interview are not 
given. Shokhin is asked to comment on what he thinks the 
government should be doing. 
  Shokhin says: "The most preferable government policy would 
be to continue maintaining the policy of the past few months. 
Any sudden fluctuations would only be worse. Continuing the 
line of the Chernomyrdin government would mean continuing the 
policy of improving the financial health and stability of the 
Russian economy, while, at the same time, taking account of the 
economy's problems and a policy of renouncing shock methods. 
The most difficult thing here is finding the golden mean." 
  Shokhin goes on to regret that experienced government 
members 
who had learned from their mistakes were leaving the government: 
  "I think both the president and the prime minister should 
keep all those willing to work at this difficult time. One 
should not, of course, be raising the issue of satisfying all 
the ultimatums coming from absolutely everyone. However, I do 
think that sensible compromises should be made here. 
Unfortunately, the present government crisis was, of course, 
prompted by the not very well-timed decree on the reorganization 
of the Cabinet." 
  Shokhin then gives his forecast of what the compositon of 
the 
new Cabinet would be: 
  "It is known that First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets will be 
remaining first vice premier. The long, drawn-out discussion 
between Fedorov and Zaveryukha has to end with the resignation 
of one of them." He says he could not say who might replace 
Gaydar on the economic portfolio: "I doubt it would be 
Yavlinskiy, because that would entail a long period during which 
the prime minister and the new father of reforms would have to 
get to know each other and learn how to work together." 
Yavlinskiy, he says, criticized Gaydar for many months, and his 
reforms would be different anyway. 
  Shokhin goes on to say that people with previous economic 
experience, like Soskovets and people who wish to continue 
reforms, should work together. Shokhin says he was given the 
CIS portfolio, but he rejected it. A ministerial post is not 
enough to deal with such a wide remit, he says, you have to have 
wider powers. He says he was also offered the economics 
portfolio, but says he cannot give his final answer until he 
knows the identity of the deputy prime minister in charge of 
macro-economic affairs. He concludes by saying: "To be honest, 
I cannot say whether I will remain in the government, although, 
to be honest, it is more interesting to work in the government 
than in the Duma, as far as I am concerned."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
1415 GMT on 20 January carries a report by Mayak correspondent 
Aleksandr Ruvinskiy on the work of the State Duma. 
  Ruvinskiy questions the wisdom of the proposed bill on the 
status of deputies, as well as the reasons behind some of the 
government's decisions, such as the refurbishing of the White 
House and moving government offices there at a considerable cost 
to the taxpayer. He then adds that Sergey Shakhray held an 
interesting news conference today at which he explained the role 
of his faction, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, in the 
Duma, and his reasons for accepting a ministerial post. 
  Shakhray says: "For the first time in three-and-a-half 
years, an opportunity--this is a very gentle, preliminary 
assessment--an opportunity has arisen for a coordinated activity 
of the legislative and the executive powers in the area of 
regional policy. Representatives of our faction in the State 
Duma are heading three committees: the Committee for Matters of 
the Federation and Regional Policy; the Committee for Matters of 
the Commonwealth and Compatriots; and the Committee for Local 
Self-government. In fact, the entire regional spectrum is 
covered by these committees in the State Duma. 
  "The position of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord is 
also very influential in the upper chamber--the Federation 
Council. My acceptance of the post of minister for 
nationalities and regional policy was influenced by another 
consideration that is very important to me. Our analysis shows 
that 1994 will be a very difficult year with respect to 
interethnic relations. There is a threat of interethnic and 
regional strife and even conflict. In this situation, it would 
have been very easy to feel insulted by the downgrading from the 
status of a deputy prime minister to the status of a minister or 
to find another plausible reason--since the administration 
provides numerous opportunities to do so--and to resign from the 
government having adopted a position of a constructive or 
non-constructive opposition and criticism. For me, such a 
position would be unacceptable from a moral and professional 
point of view. As long as there is an opportunity to influence 
regional policy, a chance to avert or minimize the negative 
consequences of possible conflicts, I will continue to work."

  [Text] Ex-Vice Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray has made it 
clear he had to refuse the post of nationalities and regional 
policy minister he had been offered. "If the situation when 
vital issues of regional and nationality policies are solved 
without participation of the government member responsible for 
these issues remains, I will not be able to work in the 
cabinet," he told INTERFAX today. 
  According to well-informed sources in the staff, Shakhray is 
virtually debarred from solving regional issues. For instance, 
the president transferred the responsibility for monitoring 
talks with Tatarstan on concluding a bilateral treaty on 
power-sharing from Shakhray to Vice Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov. 
  It was Yarov and the head of the presidential staff, Sergey 
Filatov, who held a conference with the regional leaders without 
asking Shakhray to join them. Without his participation and 
despite his recommendations, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
held consultations with a representative of the Chechen 
president, M. Mugadayev, on Friday. 
  INTERFAX learned that Shakhray did not participate in the 
first meeting of the reshuffled government. Prior to this, he 
put forward two conditions for his joining the government, i.e. 
his ministry's direct subordination to the head of the 
government and membership in the government presidium. However, 
he has never received an answer to the demands.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- "The Russia's Choice 
faction has not yet decided on whether it should oppose all the 
government or not, but, in general, it has little optimism 
concerning the cabinet's new composition," ITAR-TASS was told 
today by faction member Kirill Ignatyev. 
  In his opinion, the new cabinet will prove to be a 
government 
of inflation. This is why the Russia's Choice faction cannot 
assume the responsibility for all its work. "The faction," 
Ignatyev said, "will apparently oppose some steps of the 
government, maybe even many, while supporting only two areas 
--privatisation, for which Anatoliy Chubays is responsible, and 
the international policy. 
  "When we recommended Andrey Kozyrev, who is a member of the 
Russia's Choice movement, to stay on in the government, we were 
guided by the conviction that the Zhirinovskiy policy called for 
a serious, competent and balanced alternative, capable of 
preventing extremism from getting the upper hand," Ignatyev 
stated. 
  Economist Pavel Bunich, also a member of the Russia's Choice 
faction, told ITAR-TASS that the the formation of the new 
cabinet tended, without doubt, to reduce the vector of economic 
reforms. But this, in his opinion, could partially produce some 
rather sound results. "The point is," Bunich said, "that 
inflation was slightly checked by means of both sound and 
unsound means. Combatting inflation by not paying wages to 
people was an impermissible method, while the restriction of 
credits and subsidies to poorly functioning enterprises was a 
positive measure. It will only be for the good of the nation if 
the new government manages to do away with this harmful aspect 
of combatting inflation," the economist believes. 
  "Radicalism's attenuation in this sphere should be 
welcomed," 
he added. "However, regretful though it may be, the scales may 
be tilted further towards greater inflation," Bunich stressed. 
"Today," he believes, "there is a state of temporary balance. 
There is now an axis between the president, premier, and 
chairmen of the two chambers of the parliament. But as soon as 
inflation soars up, attempts will immediately be made to find a 
scapegoat. The parliament will point to the government, and so 
will the president. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the 
question of the cabinet's inefficiency will be raised within a 
matter of four months from now. At present, the situation within 
the government largely depends on the behaviour of the premier. 
Whereas formerly we used to claim that it depends more on Yegor 
Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, today we are witnessing the emergence 
of a one-man theatre." 
  Leader of the Russian Communist Party faction Gennadiy 
Zyuganov told ITAR-TASS that a very difficult struggle was being 
fought over the new government. "At least two loyal associates 
of Gaydar -- Anatoliy Chubays and Andrey Kozyrev -- are now 
holding key posts in it," he added. "It remains to be seen 
whether the new line will prevail, the line aimed at stabilising 
and normalising our work, when workers and commodity producers 
will be encouraged, or we shall again get a compromise hybrid, 
which will not yield anything positive," Zyuganov stated. In 
his opinion, this is the crux of the ongoing struggle. "For the 
time being, it appears that the pragmatic line is getting the 
upper hand," Zyuganov stated.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Jan -- "The most alarming thing of all 
happening in society is the real danger for the president of the 
Russian Federation becoming isolated from those who were 
professionally involved in implementing democratic reform and 
from their support," Gennadiy Burbulis, a State Duma deputy from 
the Russia's Choice Bloc, told ITAR-TASS correspondents in an 
interview. 
  "It is necessary to persuade the president that unless he 
relies on a clear and definite support from reformers, he risks 
finding himself in isolation," he said. "In that case, serious 
shocks may occur, including the hysteria around a possible 
resignation of the government." We must do all we can to 
prevent Boris Yeltsin from becoming alienated and isolated, he 
added. 
  Burbulis considers that the government, with its present 
composition, "has the resources and the country has the 
professionals to continue reform-oriented policies." As for the 
reform strategy itself, "it is in danger but not fatally so." 
  Burbulis did not rule out that "many work collectives might 
seriously express their discontent" in April and May. However, 
the president and the government are in a position to prevent 
this happening. "A search for mechanisms of social and 
professional rehabilitation of the workers who are under threat 
of lay-offs should start today," he stressed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 22 January -- Today Yegor Gaydar made an 
appeal to the participants of an assembly of Moscow's democratic 
community for a serious reconstruction of the democratic 
movement. 
  He made a speech in which he explained his reasons for 
leaving the government. Yegor Gaydar gave as one of his reasons 
for resigning the government's adoption of a decision to 
allocate $500 million toward the construction of a new 
parliament building. In his words, "To carry out a policy 
envisaging the adoption of such decisions is to go beyond the 
bounds of morality." 
  Yegor Gaydar believes that the disagreements that were 
clearly visible in the work of the government over the past year 
were linked to the fundamental question of "what kind of Russia 
we want to have." He explained that the reformers favored a 
"cheap and moderately sized state that serves society," and in 
particular, reducing the state apparatus and bringing to a 
minimum the number of government functionaries. However, there 
exists another approach in Russia as well, he said. This is "a 
strong, powerful, and expensive state, which will intervene in 
all spheres of public life and will have a powerful apparatus of 
functionaries merging with a new emerging bourgeoisie." 
  Nevertheless, Yegor Gaydar said that Russia's Choice was 
ready to support any constructive decisions by the government. 
  Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the 
future work of Anatoliy Chubays in the government, Yegor Gaydar 
said that "it will be difficult for Chubays to work." He 
explained that "the privatization process has gathered a certain 
momentum, and if people begin actively and systematically to 
wreck it, it will nevertheless continue until 1 July, when 
privatization checks expire." Yegor Gaydar expressed the hope 
that Anatoliy Chubays "will do all he can to fulfill our 
obligations." 
  The participants at the assembly supported the creation of a 
New Civic Movement. It will be formed on the basis of 
Democratic Russia. The adopted manifesto of the New Civic 
Movement [Novoye Grazhdanskoye Dvizheniye] proclaims the need 
"to build a civic society by peaceful means, improve the 
socio-economic situation of working people, and ensure a normal 
standard of living for ourselves and our children." 
  Lev Ponomarev, co-chairman of the Democratic Russia 
movement, 
said that the movement's founding conference should be held as 
early as the beginning of March.

  [Text] The president wants to continue the reforms but has 
to adapt to reality, in particular the December election 
results, former deputy prime minister Yegor Gaydar, who leads 
the Russia's Choice group in parliament, told INTERFAX. 
  "If the democrats had been united and had run the election 
campaign better, the president would be in a better position 
now," he said. 
  Gaydar, who intends to concentrate on parliamentary work 
now, 
emphasized that Russia's Choice had to formulate a clear-cut 
position for itself. "There was uncertainty about the position 
of our parliamentary group when it could not be said for sure if 
we are in power or in opposition and we were held responsible 
for decisions which we did not make," he said. Now, he said, 
the group was in constructive opposition and could criticize the 
cabinet. 
  Gaydar dismissed rumors of a split in the group. Only two 
men, Andrey Makarov and Boris Fedorov, left for the December 12 
Union, a group "which votes almost the way we do." He thought 
that for a group of 78 this did not amount to a split. 
  Commenting on the latest Duma decisions Gaydar said: "It is 
funny that the Duma discussed so thoroughly the well-being of 
the deputies and 'lavish' provisions for them were advocated by 
the communists and other left-wing parties. Despite the 
resistance mounted by Russia's Choice and my own speeches they 
secured a resounding victory in this issue."

<F P=106> ["Editorial viewpoint": "Viktor Chernomyrdin Doomed to Take </F>
Responsibility for Fate of Reform"] 
  [Text] At a news conference on Thursday [20 January] 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin announced the composition of his 
government. Three times he gave an assurance that the new 
Cabinet of Ministers would "not retreat from the adopted 
programs and will make no changes to the reform policy." 
  But did the premier actually have a clear and consistent 
reform policy in the past that would justify his talking of 
continuing that policy? No, radical economic reform was linked 
above all with the name of Yegor Gaydar, who shouldered the full 
burden of responsibility for implementing government policy but 
who had of late essentially had no opportunity to seriously 
influence that policy. The social fulmination about "shock 
therapy" bypassed the premier and was aimed directly at Gaydar 
as the father of reform and in whose shadow Oleg Soskovets, Oleg 
Lobov, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, and other industrial, financial, 
and agrarian lobbyists -- who had been appointed by Chernomyrdin 
to key posts -- flourished. Without concealing their 
aspirations with market rhetoric, many of them (Lobov, for 
instance) openly talked of the need to return to a centralized 
economy and to revive planning and state regulation. But the 
presence in the government of Yegor Gaydar and people in his 
team allowed the premier, while distancing himself from the 
radical reformers and their activity, to talk, as now, about the 
existence of a firm and consistent policy of fundamentally 
transforming the economy. 
  But if there are no deviations from this policy, as the 
premier assures us, then what does he mean by fighting inflation 
-- as he has announced -- "not with monetary means but with 
other means"? What should we read into the intention to 
distribute state subsidies "more effectively" and to repay all 
the debts of the military-industrial complex, the agricultural 
complex, and the budgetary sector? And will there really be no 
"soft loans handed out right and left" if the premier is 
nonetheless planning to issue them "selectively"? 
  Judging by the composition of the new government, which 
reflects an evident and seemingly difficult compromise between 
the premier and the president, the "period of market 
romanticism," as Viktor Chernomyrdin put it, is indeed over. 
Exactly what is meant by the market "realism" to which the 
premier is clearly more inclined will become clear in the next 
few months. But, one way or another, the head of the government 
will now have to assume full responsibility for the fate of 
reform. If this new stage in building the market economy ends 
in hyperinflation and a Russia-wide political strike prompted by 
it, then the prime minister will have to be held responsible. 
Him above all.

  [Text] Commenting on Yegor Gaydar's and Boris Fedorov's 
resignation, first deputy chairman of the Federation Council 
Ramazan Abdulatipov declared that with the help of the prime 
minister the president "has demonstrated sound sense--which he 
lacked during the implementation of reforms--courage and 
principle." 
  In his interview with Interfax Friday, Abdulatipov expressed 
the opinion that Yeltsin decided to give up further 
radicalization of reforms because these moves could pose a 
threat to economic transformations themselves. He also pointed 
out that the monetarist policy pursued from Moscow irrespective 
of regional peculiarities, including republics within the 
Russian Federation, threatens Russia's integrity. 
  "Both the prime minister and the president understood this 
principal issue. That is why they have corrected the 
composition of the government, and, God bless them to correct 
the reform course," said Abdulatipov. 
  Abdulatipov believes that Gaydar and Fedorov specifically 
slammed the door before their resignation in order to have "a 
site" to return to the government. He explained that according 
to experts' forecasts, 1994 will be a year of hard consequences 
of the errors in the sphere of economic reforms "and both Yegor 
Gaydar and Boris Fedorov know this quite well." "That is why 
Yegor Gaydar will be able to say six months from now, `it was 
better when I was in power,'" he said. 
  To this effect Abdulatipov declared that neither Yegor 
Gaydar 
nor Boris Fedorov had enough courage "to face" these problems. 
"That is why they have placed all expected difficulties on 
Viktor Chernomyrdin's shoulders, a bull carrying the Russian 
economy," he underlined. 
  Abdulatipov indicated that the period to verify reformers' 
honesty had started after Yegor Gaydar's resignation. "If they 
(leaders of Russia's Choice) are in favor of reforms they will 
occupy the most constructive position with respect to the 
Cabinet's activity. If they are not interested in the reforms' 
success and attempt to impose their representatives on the 
reformers' group, then Russia's Choice could become a wild 
critic of Chernomyrdin's government," declared Abdulatipov.

<F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts under the "Topic of the </F>
Week" rubric: "Reformers Come and Go, But What Is Left for Us?"] 
  [Text] This week has brought evidence of a universal 
revival of Russian national traditions. Not only our country, 
but the whole world has been engaged in speculation: Who is 
going to occupy the ministerial offices in Moscow in the end? 
As is the custom, as the Christmas holidays approached, 
everyone started trying to frighten each other. And very 
successful they were, too. 
  It is said that the blackest day in the history of the Tokyo 
stock exchange was the day of Stalin's death. On that occasion 
shares fell by hundreds of points and there was ruin on a mass 
scale. Naturally, Gaydar's resignation cannot be compared to a 
"father of the peoples" departing this world. But it too had an 
explosive effect. There was a disastrous fall in the ruble rate 
and a sharp increase in prices within the country. The rate of 
the West German [as published] mark against the dollar fell 
markedly. As did the currencies of the states with the closest 
economic links to Russia. Naturally, as always at a time of 
instability, gold prices rose rapidly. 
  The simplest explanation for what happened is that the 
threat 
of the departure from the Russian Government of the people they 
call reformers is causing doubts about the continuation of the 
course of reforms. In short, it transpires that industrial and 
financial circles, both in our country and elsewhere, did not 
have too much faith in assurances from the Kremlin that the 
policy of reforms will continue. 
  But surely the point here is not speculation about whether 
or 
not the reforms will continue. The government crisis is making 
people think about what these reforms, now in their third year, 
actually consist of. This is no idle question. After all, if 
the purpose and strategy of the reforms were obvious, then 
reactions would have been prompted by changes in that strategy 
(about which nothing is yet known), not in the composition of 
the government. But, as was the case 40 years ago, both for 
citizens of Russia and for the world in general, this country's 
economic policy is unpredictable. And this leaves no 
alternative but to think in terms not of the policy, but of 
specific individuals, be it Pavlov, Gaydar, or Chernomyrdin, 
whose actions in specific situations can be predicted, at least 
to some extent. And when those people go, the panic starts. 
  Maybe that is in fact the chief weakness of the Russian 
reforms. Because these reforms do not constitute a concrete 
program. They are a highly individual mix of slogans and 
reactions to developing situations in the economy. I realize 
that Gaydar and his team, when they took over the management of 
the economy, had no time for strategy. A situation close to 
chaos prevailed in the country: barter, empty stores, ration 
cards. The reformers found a lever with which to lessen that 
chaos -- price liberalization. And they tried to implement that 
liberalization as strictly -- not to say cruelly -- as possible. 
Basically, all the long-term loan bonds which past governments 
had given out to the population were scrapped. 
  As a result, by bringing about a considerable fall in living 
standards, the reformers managed to bring domestic prices into 
line with world prices. This promptly uncovered a fact which 
our economic isolation had concealed for a long time. Namely, 
that virtually all sectors of our industry are cost-based and 
not competitive. It was not a conspiracy, but the operation of 
objective laws unleashed by the reformers, which made us see our 
economy in its true light. It emerged that the majority of 
goods produced in Russia are not only worse, but more expensive 
than those produced abroad. That if you are guided solely by 
the economic expediency of today, it is far more advantageous to 
put large padlocks on virtually every sector. And to export 
oil, gas, and other raw materials, and buy all you need with the 
funds thus earned. 
  But Russia is not a Persian Gulf state. Although nowadays 
even there they are trying to diversify the economy, making use 
of the funds earned from oil sales. Our own reformers stopped 
short of what should in fact have been the essence of the reform 
-- restructuring of the economy. I cannot say whether this was 
a strategic error or whether they simply could not do it, 
because of the fierce political struggle which has become one of 
the most important factors in our economy. In any case, it 
transpired that hope was pinned mainly on the idea that the 
required restructuring would take place of its own accord, under 
the influence of objective market laws. 
  Yet the reformers knew that spontaneous market forces 
brought 
the Western world to crisis in the early thirties. Since then 
the governments of developed countries, which have always had 
market economies, have not let go of the economic helm. And if 
we have decided to enter the world market, it was of fundamental 
importance for the reformers to decide exactly what we were 
taking to that market. That is, to decide exactly which 
sectors, if not today, then tomorrow, are capable of producing 
goods that will be in demand. And then to support those 
specific sectors, not every sector. Today, when this kind of 
support is mentioned, for some reason it immediately prompts 
alarmist talk of concessionary credits and subsidies which the 
government is going to start handing out right and left without 
the reformers' supervision. Those who have political and 
personal influence know how to raise the threat of strikes or 
simply to shout loudly. 
  I agree that such credits do in fact stimulate only one area 
of production -- the printing of money that is worth less and 
less. But maybe this abnormal situation occurs because our 
captains of industry are simply disoriented. They do not know 
which sectors, apart from the fuel and energy complex, Moscow 
considers priorities. If they had some idea of that, they would 
be able to plan their own strategy right now. Curtail one area 
of production and try to start up another. Move free capital 
into sectors with a future. And citizens would not be in a 
state of total confusion, not knowing where to go with their 
vouchers. 
  After all, credits are not the only thing in the world. You 
could support priority sectors through tax concessions, or even 
not demand tax from them at all. Thereby promoting an influx of 
Russian and foreign capital. That is, try to do everything that 
is done by economic departments in the countries whose example 
we are trying to follow. It would be the height of impudence 
for me to embark on a concrete analysis of an economic program. 
That is what the professionals should be doing. Instead of 
trying to frighten each other with talk of impending chaos. A 
citizen has a right to know what the reforms really mean for him 
personally, apart from rising prices, declining living 
standards, the threat of unemployment, and being splashed with 
mud from the wheels of the proliferating Mercedes. If his 
sphere of activity has no future from the government's 
viewpoint, he should have been told this long ago. Along with a 
suggestion of what speciality -- other than selling sausages in 
the square outside the station -- might bring in a stable and 
honest income. 
  Heaven knows, I have great respect for Yegor Gaydar, who 
possesses a combination of determination and intelligence that 
is rare in Russian politicians. But I do not want my well-being 
to depend on whether he or anyone else is still in the 
government. I want to be able to plan my own life. But I can 
only do that if I know what the state wants to do.

  [Text] I don't know if we can describe what's currently 
happening in the government as a sharing-out of portfolios, but 
it certainly is being reformed. These reshuffles are causing a 
great deal of debate. Today we have the opinion of Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy. Here's what he thinks about the new-look government. 
  [Begin Yavlinskiy recording] As far as the current 
government 
and its sentiments are concerned, then I can say that it is 
typical of the governments that the Soviet Union had. It's a 
typical government, consisting of absolutely different people, 
most of whom have no legitimacy whatsoever because they're not 
elected and didn't even run for election. 
  The second factor is that this is a government that has no 
policy program. The problem, however, lies not in this but 
elsewhere: the fact is that I am very concerned over what the 
current government represents in the basic situation that today, 
this year, is beginning to emerge. [end recording] 
  Those words were said by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy at a news 
conference. My colleague Vyacheslav Osipov was there, so over 
to him. 
  [Osipov] To continue our discussion about the government: 
when Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed the decree on the 
new composition of the government-cabinet, he had already 
received several days earlier a letter from Grigoriy Yavlinskiy 
in which the member of the State Duma set out a new concept for 
structuring the government. On the basis of it, Yavlinskiy 
proposed making the government responsible for inflationary 
processes. At his news conference, the parliamentary faction 
leader set out the reasons for the country's economic recession. 
One of them, he believes, lies in mistakes made during 
privatisation: using miscalculations in the way this is 
implemented, workforces are directing all profit into 
consumption rather than production, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy thinks. 
He dwelled in particular on the complete refusal to extend soft 
loans. This only fuels inflation and causes further decline in 
the ruble rate of exchange. As regards this, Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy commented as follows: 
  [Begin Yavlinskiy recording] The falling exchange rate is 
without doubt an inflationary factor, but bringing the rate into 
line could have a positive impact for a while on our industry. 
Therefore, if you hear gung-ho claims in February that things 
are getting rather better, then that will be a temporary 
phenomenon linked to the fact that the rate of exchange is 
falling and imports are becoming less profitable than they were 
before. 
  My last remark: You know of the Belarus agreement on 
currency union. Even the sharpest critics of this agreement, 
those who are most dissatisfied with it, reckon that the cost 
comes to about 1.5 trillion rubles, a sum we cannot afford. I 
want to say that this sum cannot even compare to the debts, for 
example, that have built up to agriculture, the 
military-industrial complex, and others. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Anna Krayevskaya, Yevgeniy Krasnikov report in the "Power" </F>
column: "The New Government Consists of the Old One, While the 
Latter Has Not Been Particularly Successful in Implementing 
Reforms"] 
  [Text] Signs are that Viktor Chernomyrdin's reformed 
government is being assigned an unenviable role. The sharp jump 
in inflation in the first quarter of the year is quite obvious 
to all. This is being said by such different people as 
monetarist Boris Fedorov and his antagonist, Leonid Abalkin. An 
explosion is in the cards, and no government composition will be 
able to prevent it. In this context it is very indicative that 
the "driving force" behind the reforms, Yegor Gaydar, and their 
chief ideologue Boris Fedorov have decided to "wash their 
hands," without any longer tying themselves by participation in 
the cabinet. This produces the impression of a move calculated 
well in advance. It is also characteristic that in making 
preliminary terms for his presence in the government, Boris 
Fedorov acted not covertly, as was the done thing on Staraya 
Ploshchad, but publicly, informing journalists in detail about 
the nature of his interrelations with the premier. Now that the 
radical democrats have disavowed any responsibility for the 
state of things in the Russian economy, it is quite obvious that 
the new government will be declared the main culprit for the 
general disintegration. A corresponding directive has already 
been issued by Mikhail Poltoranin. Commenting on cadre 
reshuffles in the government, Poltoranin described them as the 
advent of "a criminal- political mafia grouping," forecasting 
with confidence that the present cabinet will leave before May 
at the latest, under the threat of a Russia-wide political 
strike. The former head of the Federal Information Center does 
not use his words lightly, and apparently in the very near 
future one should expect the beginning of a massive propaganda 
attack. One can confidently predict that the ex-ministers will 
be fairly actively using the parliament rostrum to charge the 
government with ignoring the people's hardships. Naturally the 
president himself will not be subject to critical attacks. 
  Therefore the new composition of the Chernomyrdin cabinet is 
in fact a list of "politically doomed people" whose reputation 
in the next few months will most likely suffer serious damage. 
It is not accidental that well-known politicians did not hurry 
to take charge of the bottomless ship. The clever Yavlinskiy 
seems to have seen through Gaydar's design to lure aboard the 
sinking ship one of his main political rivals in working out 
reform strategy, and therefore stipulated his participation in 
the government by a number of evidently unacceptable conditions. 
  Only "Shakhray party" leaders, who have failed to get enough 
candidates in the Duma, but on the other hand, succeeded in both 
falling out with the democrats and losing the president's favor, 
have agreed to offer their shoulders to Chernomyrdin. 
  Formally Chernomyrdin can celebrate victory. There are no 
more opponents in the government. The trouble, however, is that 
the new cabinet has actually "hung in the air:" Behind the 
White House walls, it is effectively deprived of organized 
political support. There is no political center at present, 
while the opposition will never forgive Chernomyrdin his 
unqualified support for the president during the 
September-October coup. Moreover there are no reasons that 
could force politicians from the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia or the Russian Federation Communist Party to take on 
responsibility for the government's actions. 
  The sole guarantee for the existence of the Chernomyrdin 
cabinet is Boris Yeltsin, who would apparently want neither to 
seek support exclusively among the democrats nor to increase the 
political weight of the State Duma, granting it the power to 
approve the premier. Even so these guarantees for the existence 
of the reformed government will hardly be sufficiently strong or 
long lasting.

  [Text] The document on the reform of the presidential 
administration apparatus will probably be signed next week, 
Sergey Filatov reported to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  According to Filatov, at the moment its work with the 
Federal 
Assembly needs to be intensified. In connection with this, a 
new structure is being set up to work in this area with factions 
and deputies' groups. Among other areas of the presidential 
administration's work in need of improvement, Filatov also 
mentioned the increase of the control functions over 
implementation of edicts and instructions issued by the 
president, improvement of the analytical service and relations 
with the media. As Filatov noted, the document stresses the 
important role to be played by the department engaged in working 
with the territories. In his opinion, the analysis of the 
pre-election campaign and elections has revealed various 
shortcomings in the work of local presidential representatives. 
As Filatov reported, in future, the candidates for the post of 
presidential representatives will have to be approved by heads 
of the local administration.

  [Text] In the near future the newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
will probably become the only official newspaper of the 
government. As Interfax learned in the government, this 
resolution is likely to be signed by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  At the same time the former government newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI, which declared independence in early January, will be 
"made free" without any state subsidies. However, in expert 
opinion, this decision may cause a conflict between the 
government and the State Duma, which will most demand the return 
of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  In early October last year the former newspaper of the 
Russian Supreme Soviet was reorganized by its then general 
director Pavel Gurin, former press-secretary of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  The ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA problem will be probably discussed at 
a meeting between Chernomyrdin and Speaker of the State Duma 
Ivan Rybkin, which is expected to take place this week. If they 
reach a compromise another solution is possible, whereas 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will return to the parliament and ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI to the government of the Russian Federation in a 
reorganized form and under the title DERZHAVA. 
  Otherwise the Duma will have to create a new newspaper of 
its 
own which would require additional multi-million expenses, which 
is is unlikely in the present economic situation.

<F P=106> [Appeal from Kronid Lyubarskiy, first deputy chief editor of </F>
NOVOYE VREMYA, to Russian General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik: 
"General Prosecutor's Office Is Studying the Possibility of 
Criminal Proceedings Against Zhirinovskiy" -- first two 
paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office 
Administration for Oversight of Compliance With Laws on Federal 
Security and National Relations is completing the study of 
appeals from citizens and public organizations demanding that 
criminal proceedings be instituted against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
for propaganda of war in his book "The Last Dash to the South" 
and in interviews and television appearances. 
  These documents include an appeal from Kronid Lyubarskiy, 
the 
well known defender of human rights and first deputy chief 
editor of NOVOYE VREMYA, to General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik, 
which we publish today. 
  I notify you that citizen Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, 
born 1946, has committed a crime under Article 71 of the Russian 
Federation Criminal Code: "Propaganda of War." As is well 
known, the text of the article states: "Propaganda of war, in 
whatever form it may be conducted, is punishable by imprisonment 
for a term of between three and eight years." 
  The circumstances of the case are as follows. The "Pisatel" 
limited-liability company and the "Bukvitsa" publishing 
cooperative produced a book by citizen V.V. Zhirinovskiy 
entitled "The Last Dash to the South" in a print run of 75,000 
copies. The book was signed to press 28 September 1993 and 
printed at Moscow Printing Plant No 13 (30 Denisovskiy Street, 
107005 Moscow) as order No 456. 
  In the book the author propagandizes the unleashing of 
aggressive war against Russia's neighbors Turkey, Iran, and 
Afghanistan. It is this, it transpires from the text, that is 
reflected in the very title of the book. 
  In particular, the book says: 
  "I have already begun to develop my own geopolitical 
concept. 
I don't want to give it my name, the Zhirinovskiy formula, say, 
but the last 'dash' to the south and an outlet for Russia to the 
shores of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea are really 
the task of saving the Russian nation" (page 63). 
  "The idea emerged of the last `dash' -- last because it will 
probably be the last repartition of the world and it must be 
carried out in a state of shock therapy, suddenly, swiftly, and 
effectively" (page 64). 
  "The last `dash' to the south. I dream of Russian soldiers 
washing their boots in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and 
switching to summer uniform forever. Lightweight boots, 
lightweight trousers, short-sleeved open-necked shirts with no 
tie, lightweight caps. And a small modern Russian assault rifle 
produced by the Izhevsk plant. These assault rifles are much 
better than UZI's. So any platoon of Russian soldiers can 
impose order anywhere" (page 66). 
  "...we will make this last `dash' to the south. We badly 
need it, it is medicine that we must take. Medicine is not 
always sweet. Some people in Kabul, Tehran, and Ankara may not 
like this. But millions of people will feel better as a result" 
(page 67). 
  "Our Army will perform this task. This will be a method of 
ensuring the survival of the nation as a whole, it will be the 
basis for the renaissance of the Russian Army. New armed forces 
can be reborn only as a result of a combat operation. The Army 
cannot grow stronger in military commissariats and barracks. It 
needs a goal, a task" (page 70). 
  "The pros of carrying out this operation considerably 
outweigh the cons which may naturally be perceived. And the 
Russian Army also needs this so that our guys can flex their 
muscle, tired as they are of `hazing,' instead of sitting around 
in barracks, in the depths of Russia, waiting for the end of 
their term of service, not knowing where the enemy is, who the 
adversary is, or what they need to prepare themselves morally 
and physically for. This would be a cleansing for us all" (page 
75). 
  "May Russia successfully accomplish its last 'dash' to 
the south. I see Russian soldiers preparing for this last 
southern campaign. I see Russian commanders at the headquarters 
of Russian divisions and armies tracing the itineraries for the 
movement of troop formations and the destinations of the 
itineraries. I see aircraft at airbases in southern districts 
of Russia. I see submarines surfacing off the shores of the 
Indian Ocean and landing ships approaching shores along which 
Russian Army soldiers are already marching, infantry fighting 
vehicles are driving, and huge masses of tanks are moving. 
(The italics are V. Zhirinovskiy's.) At long last Russia 
completes its last military campaign" (pages 142-143). 
  It is perfectly obvious that the above remarks constitute 
every indication of a full-blown crime under Article 71 of the 
Russian Federation Criminal Code. 
  There are grounds for believing that this is not the only 
criminal episode on the part of V. Zhirinovskiy. Practically 
all the mass media reported V. Zhirinovskiy's statements 
regarding the possibility of delivering nuclear strikes against 
Japan and Germany and his threats to "give them a new Hiroshima" 
and a "new Chernobyl." V. Zhirinovskiy made these statements 
orally, so they are not documented. However, it should not be 
difficult to find journalists who witnessed these episodes and 
to check whether these criminal episodes did indeed take place 
and, if so, in what circumstances. 
  On the basis of the above I ask you to open a criminal case 
against citizen Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy under Article 71 
of the Russian Federation Criminal Code. The crime envisaged by 
this article ranks among particularly dangerous state crimes. 
Consequently V. Zhirinovskiy's actions affect the vital 
interests of all citizens, myself included, since they 
jeopardize everyone's personal safety. 
  The election of V. Zhirinovskiy as a State Duma deputy, 
which, incidentally, took place after he committed the crime, 
cannot serve as grounds for refusing to open a criminal case. 
As is well known, this question has already been the subject of 
judicial consideration at the trial on the SCSE [State Committee 
for the State of Emergency] case in relation to defendants A.I. 
Lukyanov and V.A. Starodubtsev. 
  At the court sitting 5 January 1994 the presiding judge, 
A.T. 
Ukolov, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Supreme Court 
Military Collegium, explaining his refusal to terminate the 
criminal case regarding Lukyanov, cited Article 98 of the 
Russian Federation Constitution. According to this article, the 
immunity of Federal Assembly deputies is not universal but 
limited and consists merely in the fact that deputies "cannot be 
detained, arrested, or searched unless detained at the scene of 
a crime, nor can they be subjected to a body search except as 
provided by federal law in order to guarantee other people's 
safety." The fact that deputies enjoy immunity does not 
preclude the opening of a criminal case and the carrying out of 
preliminary and judicial investigations regarding a deputy. 
  The General Prosecutor's Office did not protest this 
decision 
by the Russian Federation Supreme Court Military Collegium and 
therefore showed solidarity with it. Since the criminal 
prosecution of State Duma Deputy A.I. Lukyanov and Federation 
Council Member V.A. Starodubtsev has not been stopped, then, in 
accordance with the principle of citizens' equality before the 
law (Article 19 of the Russian Federation Constitution), nothing 
can be a barrier to the criminal prosecution of State Duma 
Deputy V. Zhirinovskiy. 
  If the question of arresting V. Zhirinovskiy arises in the 
future, the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office can 
ask the State Duma to strip Deputy V. Zhirinovskiy of his 
immunity under Article 98 of the Russian Federation Constitution. 
  I do not know V.V. Zhirinovskiy's place of residence, but it 
can easily be established via the staff of the Russian 
Federation State Duma. 
  I await your reply within the legally prescribed deadline. 
  Respectfully 
  [Signed] K. Lyubarskiy

<F P=106> [Ravil Zaripov "Reportage from LDPR Headquarters": "`We Are </F>
Like the CPSU Central Committee Buro!'"] 
  [Text] Sretenka Street, old Moscow. This place has now 
become a magnet for journalists. The reason for this is not the 
smooth, romantic curve of the ancient boulevard covered with a 
Christmassy carpet, nor the monument to Nadezhda Krupskaya in a 
white cap pulled down over her eyes. The reason is an old 
building giving onto Sretenka or, rather, its inhabitants. The 
top two floors of the four-story building house the headquarters 
of LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, whom some people call a buffoon, others the new 
"fuehrer," and yet others the savior of Russia's national idea. 
  ...I encountered the first cordon in the vestibule, right 
after the entrance doorway covered in posters bearing the 
leader's portrait. Two dashing guys dressed in army peacoats 
carefully examined my journalist's ID card. "Fourth floor. Do 
you have an appointment?" 
  A broad marble staircase with broken edges to the steps and 
a 
gaping empty shaft in the middle (all that is left of the 
elevator). A guard outside the door. Through it I could see 
another checkpoint: a table, a chair, and a man approximately 
50 years old. A not very affable welcome. "About 40 of you 
guys have already arrived. Go to the organization department." 
The department was in a muddle. "Have you spoken with Viktor 
Vasilyevich Kobelev?" "Yes." "Then go to him," a blond woman 
waved me away. The senior checkpoint man raised the "barrier," 
but, just in case, he gave me an escort. 
  For your information. The Sretenka building has been leased 
by the LDPR for approximately two years. It mainly houses the 
party's apparatus, broken down into departments: organization, 
transport and economic, agitation and propaganda, youth, and 
others. In all, there are approximately 25-30 people on the 
staff. Here, too, are Zhirinovskiy's waiting room and office 
and the premises of the Moscow organization's leaders. Work 
with regional organizations is conducted from here. 
  The higher council meets regularly -- once every two weeks 
-- 
in the Sretenka building. It is the team which decides 
political directions and the strategy and tactics of the 
struggle. "We are like the CPSU Central Committee Politburo," 
LDPR First Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Vengerovskiy explained to a 
journalist. The "LDPR Politburo" was reelected a year ago. To 
all appearances, the work of the special services is one of its 
chief spheres of interest. Thus, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy is in 
charge of the party's secret service and is drawing up a project 
for a "Russian Intelligence Service." Deputy director of a 
Moscow scientific research institute (and a graduate of Moscow 
Aviation Institute and the Foreign Trade Academy), he has made a 
careful study of the history of the MOSSAD -- Israeli 
intelligence. Sergey Abeltsev, another council member, is 
responsible for counterintelligence issues and the creation of 
defense structures. He is currently working as deputy chairman 
of a joint-stock company based on one of the largest collective 
farms in Moscow Oblast. He has had a military education. 
  Despite the higher council members' fine-sounding titles and 
the garish publicity surrounding their spheres of activity, 
Zhirinovskiy's real right-hand man has the modest post of deputy 
chairman of the LDPR. Although also a member of the 
"Politburo," Viktor Kobelev keeps in the shadows. But he is the 
man who is "boss" of the headquarters, in charge of all its 
activity. It is Viktor Kobelev who tightly coordinates the 
activities of the party (approximately 120,000 members), as was 
clearly manifested during the election campaign. 
  The original LDPR candidates' list contained 160 names, 
which were reduced to 147. The candidates' average age is 46. 
The list contains just nine women (the first of them occupies 
only the 32d position on the list). In terms of profession half 
of the first 60 names (the actual number of deputies' seats) are 
economists, jurists, entrepreneurs, or journalists. Persons 
engaged in physical labor make up no more than 10 percent. 
  The LDPR's federal list includes representatives of half of 
the regions of Russia, although the regions' representation is 
patchy. Muscovites make up half the list (80 percent of the 
first 60 names). The following are represented by several 
candidates (in decreasing order): Vologda, St. Petersburg, 
Pskov, Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh, Krasnoyarsk, Komi, and 
Udmurtia. The LDPR has its strongest positions in northwest 
Russia, the Volga region, and central Russia. It is weak in the 
south, in the Urals, and beyond the Urals. 
  A brief conversation with the building's "boss" proved 
profitable. He agreed to the idea of a reportage. Could I see 
Zhirinovskiy? He was leaving for the airport in an hour, and 
there were lots of journalists wishing to see him. Maybe I 
could go in for a few minutes with those who had been standing 
in line. 
  "Viktor Vasilyevich, the boys and I have gotten hold of 30 
tonnes of gasoline. You have to give a woman a little gift." 
"OK, go on. Then you go!" 
  The presence of a journalist plainly did not fit in with the 
"nerve center's" operation. I was given to understand that it 
would be more convenient if I waited in the waiting room. 
  Initially the youth policy department somehow won people 
over. Particularly as the "Zhirinovskiy Rock Store" was located 
behind the stairs between the building's first and second 
floors. The range included black "metal" jackets, T-shirts, 
posters of hard rock stars, LDPR symbols, and...a constant din 
from loudspeakers. But here, behind the office door, it is all 
quiet. The young men in the department obviously do not get 
their clothes from the "rock store" -- their clothes and their 
hairdos are neat and tidy. From their conversation: "I am 
working in the security service now. Here is my valid ID card." 
"That's OK, that's good. We will register you, and then we 
will be in touch." Obviously, people were not being received 
into the Young Pioneers or the Boy Scouts. A young man evidently 
wanted to join "Zhirinovskiy's falcons" and was demonstrating 
his professional suitability. 
  From closed sources. For official use. The election results 
in the closed precincts of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Security showed that, 
on the whole, the mood of the power ministries' personnel is no 
different from the sympathies of the majority of Russia's 
population. Moreover, the overall voting results in the closed 
precincts are still more depressing for "Russia's Choice" than 
in the country as a whole. On average, in closed precincts in 
Defense Ministry subdivisions the LDPR got 34 percent of the 
votes, the Communists 9 percent, and "Russia's Choice" 11 
percent respectively. It is characteristic that the opposition 
got the largest number of votes among servicemen serving in "hot 
spots" (the Dniester region, Tajikistan). The LDPR got the 
smallest number of votes (19 percent) among Black Sea Fleet 
personnel, and the largest number (49 percent) among personnel 
of the Northwest Group of Forces. At the same time the LDPR 
garnered 31 percent of the votes among Military Space Forces 
personnel and 32 percent among servicemen in Strategic Missile 
Forces units. 
  "...Have you read my book `Push to the East'? Read it." 
  Zhirinovskiy's office is very different from the other 
rooms. 
Here you will not see ill-assorted furniture or the worn 
oriental carpets laid in the waiting room. A plush sofa and 
chairs are ranged along the wall. Above them hang reproduction 
portraits of Suvorov, Kutuzov, Nakhimov, and Ushakov. An icon 
in the corner. Behind the chairman's chair is a picture 
depicting the outline of Russia with Alaska adjacent to it. 
Over all this hovers a falcon with a fluttering ribbon banner: 
"Freedom, LDPR, Law." 
  The office's chief feature is an old-style T-shaped oak 
table 
in the middle of the room. It is surrounded by carved chairs 
covered in dark velvet with raised roses on it. The unusually 
tall and pompous chair backs are surmounted by heraldic 
triangular shields with a watchtower carved in the center. An 
oak bookcase is in the same style -- a stand with carved doors. 
(According to the bosses, all this was made by a party member, 
a master cabinet maker). The book "Through the Cordilleras" 
lies on the case. The overall picture is completed by a 
political map of the world. 
  The LDPR leader is in his element. 
  "We are against preserving the CIS, just as we are against 
recreating the USSR. If anybody wants to join Russia, they are 
welcome, only with the rights of a territorial unit: a province 
or oblast. No national-state formations. 
  "In Europe we have an alliance with Germany, because it is a 
major country. But Poland lies between us, and there are 
problems there. I know the mood in Germany -- to get back 
eastern Prussia, but that is part of Poland.... These, however, 
are Polish-German problems. 
  "We are pro-Europe. As regards India, for example, it is our 
strategic ally in the East. We must set up a new axis: 
Germany-Russia-India. We will resolve the question of the 
Kuril Islands jointly with the Japanese...." 
  The conversation took place under specific conditions. 
Floodlights were suspended from above, behind the LDPR 
chairman's chair -- two on each side, directed at the visitor. 
The strong, concentrated light created the illusion of being 
either on the stage or in the office of a Lubyanka investigator 
in the thirties. 
  [Zaripov] Are you worried about the problem of 
Zhirinovskiy's physical removal? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, because there is no getting away from 
fate. Lincoln had to be killed, so they killed him. Kennedy -- 
they killed him. Palme -- they killed him.... 
  [Zaripov] But you have guards. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] O-o-oh! Twenty counterintelligence officers 
who have been through Afghanistan, Abkhazia, and the Dniester 
region. Excellent guys; they handle all types of weapons. 
(According to Vengerovskiy, men who once guarded Brezhnev are 
Zhirinovskiy's personal bodyguards -- R.Z.). Half the people in 
my office are guards. Even at night I have a guard by me. If 
necessary, they will blow up this entire building. 
[Zhirinovskiy ends] 
  The conversation ended on this optimistic note. Zhirinovskiy 
broke off his "stream of consciousness," which is almost 
impossible to do from the outside. The silence which was on the 
point of ensuing was broken by the voice of his secretary, 
coming through the half-open office door: "Mind, you have to 
pay to speak with Vladimir Volfovich. Three minutes cost $100." 
A mental calculation left me in no doubt: The possible cost 
would easily pay for a ticket to, let us say, the Cape Verde 
Islands. It was high time to retire home, to the motherland.

  [Text] The political bloc Fatherland held its founding 
conference in Novosibirsk on Sunday [23 January] and proclaimed 
its election program: to protect the political and economic 
interests of ethnic Russians. The elections to local government 
bodies are scheduled for March 27th. 
  The bloc includes the Novosibirsk branches of Constitutional 
Democrats, of the Liberal Democratic Party, and of the National 
Salvation Front, as well as representatives of the local Cossack 
community. 
  A leading member of the bloc, Aleksandr Lyulko of the 
Cossack 
community, told Interfax that Fatherland gathered all parties 
and movements from Novosibirsk Region opposed to the present 
government and president. 
  According to Lyulko, the bloc hopes to win the upcoming 
elections to local government bodies. "The victory won at 
December's elections by the Liberal Democratic Party shows that 
the Russian people, particularly those who live in Novosibirsk 
Region, are attracted by national-patriotic, not democratic, 
ideals," he said.

  [Text] Pro-democracy groups meeting in Moscow on Saturday 
announced creation of a new Civic Movement. 
  They issued a manifesto saying the democrats sustained a 
crushing defeat in last month's general elections. 
  For the past two years, it says, pro-democracy groups have 
supported the new establishment and the president though being 
aware of their weakness and mistakes. "But we were also aware of 
something even worse than that -- the establishment's growing 
indifference to the electorate," says the manifesto. 
  The authors of the manifesto speak of a dramatic change with 
"alienation between the government and the people reaching any 
acceptable limits." 
  "Amid continuing hardships caused by economic crisis, this 
is 
fraught with social upheavals," it says. 
  The authors called for an alternative policy of reforms to 
the benefit of the people. 
  The manifesto says the country still has a chance to build a 
civilian society peacefully, create a robust middle class, 
redress the plight of hired workers, and give each honest man an 
opportunity to ensure a decent standard of living for himself 
and his family.

  [Text] Economic advisers to the Russian government Anders 
Oslund of the Stockholm School of Economics and Jeffrey Sachs of 
Harvard University have sent a letter to President Yeltsin 
saying they refuse further work. 
  The two experts spoke of not wanting to help the Russian 
government further because "the Prime Minister-declared aims are 
entirely out of line with our personal views." They fear that 
with the arrival of the new Russian government, the situation 
will exacerbate following further inflation, already among the 
world's highest. 
  Pointing to austerity measures carried out by Estonia, 
Latvia 
and Poland, which succeeded in curbing inflation, Oslund and 
Sachs expressed the hope for a successful reform in Russia. 
They also spoke of wanting to work on a personal basis with 
reform supporters and a new generation of Russian pro-market 
economists. 
  To avoid a diversion from the course of reforms, the new 
government ought to include competent people not lobbyists such 
as Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Oslund told Interfax. 
Oslund and Sachs have worked for the Russian government since 
1991.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin tried to dispel predictions that the 
economic policy of the new government may result in 
hyperinflation and said that the tough financial policy will 
continue. He also hinted that the government may agree with 
producers and trade unions on a temporary price and wage freeze. 
  "The tough financial policy will not be eased to any degree. 
Let nobody count on that", Chernomyrdin told reporters before 
leaving for Omsk on Monday. 
  "No radical turns are planned" in the course of reforms, the 
prime minister said and added that the government would adhere 
to the programme of transformations which was adopted last 
August and approved by the president. 
  "Nobody has changed the programme of reforms which was 
adopted last August 6 and approved by the president. No changes 
were introduced to it when (Yegor) Gaydar came to the government 
in September 1993. He accepted it and agreed with it", 
Chernomyrdin said. 
  He also said that he does not plan to fully abandon 
monetarist approaches to reforms. "But time has come to use also 
non-monetarist methods in solving our economic problems", 
according to the prime minister. 
  The latter include, in particular, agreements between the 
government, trade unions and producers on fixing prices and on 
"establishing for a certain period of fixed wages", according to 
the prime minister. 
  "There are many other ways capable of improving the 
situation", he added, but did not elaborate. 
  The prime minister denied press reports about his 
contradictions with the president and said he had no 
disagreements with Boris Yeltsin either on the course of reforms 
or on the personnel policy in the government. 
  "I always agree the main, basic directions of the work of 
the 
government with the president. He has to know them and will 
know them", Chernomyrdin said. 
  He objected to attempts to discredit the new Russian 
Government even before it began to work and added that the main 
part of the government had been preserved. 
  He also denied allegations that he faced opposition in the 
government during 1993. "I am not a schoolboy. I would not 
tolerate it. If they mean Gaydar and Fedorov, I believe they 
had no problems working with Chernomyrdin", the prime minister 
said.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Berger: "In Memory of the Policy of </F>
Financial Stabilization"] 
  [Text] Three hours after the premier's news conference on 
the new government Finance Minister Boris Fedorov announced that 
he did not think he could remain in the cabinet. 
  So the policy of financial stabilization is now absolutely 
officially dead. Prematurely, without having achieved much of 
what could and should have been achieved. The deceased had been 
weak, of course, and was a lot of trouble for people, but some 
future hopes were pinned on it. 
  "Granny," Korney Chukovskiy's young heroine asked, "when you 
die will they bury you in the ground?" "Yes," granny replied. 
"Deep?" "Deep." "Good, so I will be able to play with your 
sewing machine as much as I like." 
  No doubt the "sewing machines" of the Main Administration 
for 
the Production of State Bank Notes, Coins, and Medals will be 
chattering away for all they are worth very soon. The Central 
Bank has already placed an order for the first quarter -- the 
volume of money to be printed exceeds the entire amount of cash 
available last year. We also know that 100,000-rouble [R] bills 
have been printed and the likelihood is that we will soon have 
them in our hands. It is perfectly clear that the printed bank 
notes will not be languishing in bank storerooms. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, as head of the new-look cabinet, promised first to 
pay any money owing to farmers, the military-industrial complex, 
and budget-funded sectors. According to the most modest 
estimates, that is R10 trillion, not counting the R10 trillion 
the government was already intending to spend in the first 
quarter. 
  Debts have to be paid, of course, but who, aside from the 
agrarian lobby, forced us to be beholden to the farmers at 
utterly absurd prices? Who is forcing military expenditure to 
remain at a level that is only appropriate for a country at war? 
It is clear that the claims by Vice Premier Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, who has already prepared a decree on agriculture 
worth R26 trillion, are incompatible even with the moderate 
financial policy the now former finance minister had agreed to. 
  If the finance minister says he cannot cooperate with the 
head of the Central Bank, while the premier does not see any 
reason why Gerashchenko should go, it is easy to guess who will 
remain in the boat. It should be remembered that there remains 
yet another principled opponent of Gerashchenko in the 
government -- Anatoliy Chubays, the last Gaydarite. He was one 
of the most vigorous critics of the Central Bank chief by virtue 
of the latter's operating a system of the reciprocal offsetting 
of state enterprises' debts, while Gerashchenko responded by 
saying that the "little Chubayses" were hindering normal 
operations. If the problem of which of them remains and which 
of them goes recurs in the future, it is easy to predict who 
will be favored. 
  So, having left the cabinet practically bereft of those who 
designed and executed the former policy, Chernomyrdin announces 
that the course of reforms is unchanged. If the unchanged 
course consists in a switch from monetarist to nonmonetarist 
methods of combating inflation, as the premier promised, then 
there will certainly have to be different people in the 
government to continue it in that way. Although, it is rather 
difficult to imagine what the premier's new principles for 
combating inflation will be like in practice. Price freeze? 
Stronger state levers to influence economic activity? All this 
is very much akin to free medicines, concerning which it is said 
that free treatment means no treatment. 
  Gaydar's former colleague, former Vice Premier Sergey 
Shakhray, who went to Chernomyrdin last May to try to persuade 
him to bring Russia's [former FRG Economics Minister] Erhard 
back into the government, now says that his vice premier 
colleagues are leaving the government to avoid being held 
responsible. Shakhray himself remains -- presumably because he 
is not afraid of his responsibility for interethnic conflicts? 
  As for responsibility, why, one wonders, is it only the 
premier's deputies that are being blamed for all the policy 
failures? What about the premier himself, who has led the 
government for 13 months now -- has he nothing to do with it, 
and don't the results of the elections, which provided the 
political grounds for the reshuffle, affect him at all? Why 
not? Was he obediently carrying out Gaydar's will even during 
the period when he was absent and therefore is not responsible 
for the result? But if he was an independent leader, why does 
he not share the responsibility? 
  It appears that our economy is on the brink of major 
changes, 
back to the old days. Fedorov has aligned himself with Gaydar, 
who a week before had said that he found it impossible to be a 
party to such changes. Maybe Fedorov will be one of the leaders 
of Irina Khakamada's new "Union of 12 December" Duma faction. 
Maybe he will head the banking subcommittee and hound 
Geraschenko from there. But the move by the reformist wing from 
government to parliament is unlikely to have a major effect on 
the body's work. Although one can hope that the 
liberal-agrarian-communist majority in parliament will have few 
quarrels with the present government and the long-awaited peace 
will be established between the two hostile branches of 
authority. But what will become of the economy?

  [Text] In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX today, 
Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said that the 
Economics Ministry he heads should play the key part in shaping 
up the strategy of reforms. 
  Shokhin believes that the Economics Ministry should not only 
calculate the effects of economic decisions, but also "thrust 
quite explicit variants of economic policy on the government." 
  Following the changes in the government's structure and 
personal composition, the ministry should take up coordinating 
the policies towards both domestic and foreign investments, 
Shokhin said. Therefore, the functions of the Russian Agency for 
International Cooperation and Development which earlier 
attracted foreign investments must be transferred to the 
Economics Ministry. 
  In addition, the ministry will focus on the maintenance of 
financial proportions in the economy and access to the world 
market, according to Shokhin. 
  Commenting on Boris Fedorov's resignation, Shokhin noted: 
"Boris Grigoryevich put himself in quite an uncomfortable 
position by making a number of wittingly uncompromising demands 
formulated in quite an indelicate manner." 
  Fedorov made the resignation of Vice Prime Minister 
Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha and Central Bank Chairman Viktor Geraschenko a 
condition to his work in the reorganized government. 
  "It seems to me that the main thing Boris Fedorov could 
demand from the president and the prime minister was pursuing a 
certain course of financial policy and make this a condition to 
his stay in the government only," the minister said. 
  "If Boris Fedorov sincerely believed that Geraschenko and 
Zaveryukha hampered the reforms, the need for Fedorov's presence 
in the government as a counterbalance to these people must be 
even stronger," Shokhin is convinced. 
  "I do not think that the life of the present government may 
shorten due to the absence of Gaydar and Fedorov," Shokhin 
pointed out adding that "everything will depend on the line the 
cabinet will be pursuing."

  [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice faction 
in the State Duma, has expressed hope that the new Cabinet of 
Ministers will not do things that will quickly wreck the economy. 
  Speaking at a democratic meeting in Moscow, Yegor Gaydar 
said 
that reformers in the government had seen Russia as a state that 
could serve society. In his words, this approach envisaged 
cutting down the state apparatus and minimizing officials' right 
to divide and distribute; and reformers did achieve some degree 
of success. 
  Yegor Gaydar noted that by the time he left the government, 
the average salary in Russia had reached $100 a month, a large 
trade surplus had been achieved, and large stocks of grain to 
last until the next harvest had been amassed. Hence, dependence 
on grain imports has decreased sharply, the free market is 
beginning to work, and shortages have been fended off. 
  Yegor Gaydar said that if the situation becomes critical, 
members of the present government might try to lay the blame for 
it on the reformers. 
  He declined to comment on reports that Mikhail Gorbachev's 
former consultants, Leonid Abalkin and Nikolay Petrakov, have 
been drafted in to adjust the economic reform.

<F P=106> [Igor Lenskiy report: "The Last Parade Is Beginning?"] </F>
  [Text] According to reports received by your PRAVDA 
correspondent from a high-ranking officer at the CIS military 
staff, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is expected to be removed 
from office in the current government reshuffle. At first 
sight, this move appears unlikely given Boris Yeltsin's 
particularly confidential relationship with Pavel Grachev, whose 
45th birthday the president celebrated with him in person. 
According to the source, however, the main reason for the 
expected ouster is the need, which has become overdue, to get 
rid of a person responsible in large measure for the 4 October 
bloodbath. In particular, the top brass has long been demanding 
that from the president. It should be added that yesterday 
Pavel Grachev was released from a hospital where he was treated 
for the exacerbation of heart disease. The Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry's press service, where we turned to for 
explanation, was concerned by Viktor Chernomyrdin's not 
mentioning the Defense Ministry chief in his news conference. 
  According to information from our confidential source, the 
Defense Ministry may for the first time be headed by a civilian, 
current Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, doctor of 
sciences, responsible for matters related to state-of-the-art 
military hardware and weaponry.

  [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry has held an expanded 
interdepartmental conference to discuss a concept of 
military-legal reform for the Russian Armed Forces. 
  It was noted during the conference that the purposes, goals, 
and stages of a military-legal reform should fit the concept for 
the structure of the country's armed forces and the principles 
of a democratic, law-based state. Therefore, they will be drawn 
up in accordance with the Constitution and the Russian military 
doctrine. It is planned to complete the drafting of a concept 
for military-legal reform in June 1994.

  [Excerpt] Our correspondent Marina Chernukha attended a 
news conference at the Defense Ministry, which was devoted to 
the call-up into the ranks of Russia's armed forces. 
  [Chernukha] Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the 
General Staff, admitted quite frankly that the call-up into the 
army is proceeding with great difficulty. Our main task is to 
maintain the minimum permissible level of service manning, he 
said. According to him the army at present is manned with only 
54 percent of the privates and sergeants it needs. Meanwhile he 
still has hopes of raising this level by fall 1994 to 95 
percent. 
  Kolesnikov considers that the Law on Military Service is to 
all intents and purposes not operating. This is shown in 
particular by the fact that last year about 20,000 young men 
were able to avoid their service for no good reason. A further 
25 percent of the total number of potential conscripts are 
unable to serve for health reasons. The situation is to a great 
extent being rectified by the so-called contract men. At 
present there are about 120,000 contract servicemen in the army, 
and next year their numbers will increase by a further 150,000. 
  In conclusion, Mikhail Kolesnikov stated that by the end of 
1994 the army will have been reduced to 2,000,000 servicemen, 
which is 100,000 fewer than the figure planned in the recent 
past. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- The Russian Government 
Academy is holding an international conference to discuss the 
defence industry's conversion to civilian production in the 
Russian Federation and other countries of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  The conference was convened on the initiative of the non- 
governmental foundation "International Humanitarian Dimension", 
the Russian Government Academy, the conversion fund attached to 
the presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences and some 
research and producing associations of the Russian Federation. 
  Representatives of the Federal Defence Ministry, scientists,

investors and manufacturers of new products, as well as the 
centres for the creation of new jobs for former servicemen and 
their families. 
  The three-day conference will also discuss political aspects 
of conversion, the role of information in the development of 
businesses in Russia and other CIS countries.

  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- The output of Russian 
defence plants dropped by 19.6 per cent in 1993 as compared to 
1992, including the production of civil goods by 14.1 per cent. 
  The production of consumer goods by enterprises of the State 
Committee for Defence Industries was cut by almost five times, 
sources at the committee told BUSINESS-TASS here today. 
  The rates of production recession gradually increased from 
September 1993; the December drop amounted to 28.2 per cent as 
against the annual drop of 19.6 per cent. 
  According to committee specialists, the overall defence 
production recession amounted to 42.3 per cent from December 
1991 through December 1993 (a period of reforms), which may 
result in the soonest halt of some branches.

  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- Russian Atomic Energy 
Minister Viktor Mikhaylov sent a letter to Interior Minister 
Viktor Yerin, requesting to take adequate measures to prevent 
Interior Ministry staff members from making reports on the 
situation at the Atomic Energy Ministry, "which are based on 
fabrications and fantasies without appropriate scientific 
examination and documented confirmation". 
  The letter was prompted by the fact that Interior Ministry 
officials made statements for some mass media, alleging that 
thefts of arms uranium, plutonium and even nuclear warheads from 
facilities of the military-industrial complex and the Atomic 
Energy ministry have become an ordinary thing. 
  Mikhaylov claimed that there are no facts corroborating 
thefts of arms plutonium and nuclear warheads from the 
ministry's facilities. If the Interior Ministry has such facts, 
they should be documented.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev does not 
intend to take a "pro-Serbian" position in the settlement of the 
Bosnian conflict despite the threats from LDP [Liberal 
Democratic Party] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Kozyrev 
announced this to an Interfax correspondent before leaving 
Moscow for Kyrgyzstan and China on Monday. 
  Zhirinovskiy stated last week that he gave Kozyrev a "week 
for thought," and if the Russian foreign minister did not 
correct his approach Zhirinovskiy would seek his resignation. 
  The foreign minister pointed out that the LDP leader's 
position was an "overt attempt to push Russia into a world war." 
He warned against engaging Russia in the conflict on the Balkan 
peninsula, where the First World War had started and led to the 
seizure in Russia of power by an irresponsible clique causing 
monstrous damage to the country for 70 years. 
  According to Kozyrev, "some political forces" may try to get 
Russia involved in a "global catastrophe," to make a career of 
this and to seize power. 
  "I am not satisfied with this scenario either in foreign or 
in domestic policy and I will never be satisfied with it. If 
after this Zhirinovskiy demands my resignation I will consider 
this as the best recognition of the correctness of my policy," 
the minister pointed out.

  [Text] "I would not be in a hurry to call the new 
composition of the Russian government conservative," Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told a group of journalists 
before his departure for Kyrgyzstan and China. 
  The minister said he had met with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and Prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin before leaving on 
the visits and called these meetings "rich in content." Kozyrev 
said the prime minister was "determined to maintain financial 
discipline, even restrict it, and limit spending and loans." 
  Kozyrev said Chernomyrdin intended to attend to the European 
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to explain Russia's 
economic policy there. "We are planning considerable steps to 
streamline the economic reforms," he pointed out. 
  The foreign minister said he believed it a big mistake of 
Moscow's western partners and friends to wait for the failure of 
reforms in Russia. "It is necessary to make real business and 
help the Russian reforms instead of waiting for the scenario of 
the end of the world to come," he said. 
  In an answer to an Interfax question, Kozyrev said his 
political views had seen no changes. 
  "Kozyrev is still the same," the minister said. "He still 
supports good-neighborly relations with the Baltic states and an 
organized withdrawal of (Russian - IF note) troops on the basis 
of agreements rather than cries about occupants, etc., what I 
call political hysteria. But he still supports observing human 
rights." At the same time, Kozyrev regretted that the Baltic 
states "were going further along the way of violating human 
rights." Among such violations, the minister indicated the 
"attempt to deport dozens of thousands people" from Latvia and 
"possibly Estonia."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev is leaving for China for his first official visit 
this year. It is considered symbolic that for Russia the year 
1994 is beginning with the U.S. President's Moscow visit and the 
Russian foreign minister's visit to Beijing. According to a 
high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry official, these visits 
confirm that Russia's foreign policy is balanced and looks 
equally to the West and the East. 
  The visit is being held according to agreements on regular 
contacts and high-level consultations on issues of interest 
between the two countries. These agreements were reached during 
the Russian president's visit to China in 1992. 
  During the forthcoming talks in China, the two sides plan to 
discuss issues of preparation for the second Russian-Chinese 
summit. The negotiators will consider a wide range of issues of 
bilateral relations and regional and international problems of 
their common interest. It is obvious that Russian-Chinese 
relations have an influence on stability and security in Asia 
and all over the world, Mikhail Beliy, head of the First Asian 
Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told ITAR-TASS on 
Monday. 
  Positions of the two countries coincide on many 
international 
and regional issues, but naturally there are differences as 
well. The countries are working to settle them. 
  The Russian delegation will visit the province of Guangdong 
and familiarise itself with the special economic zone in 
Shezheng. The idea of creating such zones has provided a great 
stimulus to the development of China's economy. This idea has 
not yet been studied thoroughly in Russia, but is now being 
actively considered in the country. 
  Possibilities of and prospects for the development of 
economic and trade cooperation are to be discussed in Beijing. 
The volume of bilateral trade (38 per cent of which was 
accounted for by machinery exports to China) amounted to 7.2 
billion dollars in 1993, a record for bilateral trade. The 
trade balance, 2 billion dollars, is in favour of Russia, though 
it has a clearing debt to China. It is worth mentioning that 
China is second only to Germany among Russian trade partners. 
  Progress has also been made in military and technical 
cooperation. Moscow exported SU-27 military aircraft and S-300 
missile systems to Beijing. 
  The countries are conducting border negotiations. A treaty 
on settlement in the eastern section of the border was signed in 
May, 1991. A joint delegation from the two countries is still 
working on the western section. 
  "There are unsettled border problems, but there is no 
animosity, no danger of explosive situations", the Russian 
Foreign Ministry official believes. 
  During Andrey Kozyrev's visit, the sides are to sign a 
treaty 
on check points on the Russian-Chinese border and a protocol of 
consultations between the two countries' foreign ministries. 
There are 21 such check points (19 of which are operating) and 
the treaty is to fix the rules for their work and envisage new 
ones to cope with the increased traffic between Russia and 
China. 2.5 million people crossed the border last year. 
  Comprehensive development of Russian-Chinese relations and 
cooperation is in the interests of the two countries. It is 
mutually advantageous and promising, Beliy said.

<F P=106> [By station commentator Kondratyev from the "Current Event </F>
and Commentary" program] 
  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev is scheduled to 
visit China from 26-29 January. Station commentator Kondratyev 
said: The main purpose of Kozyrev's forthcoming visit is to 
prepare for the second Sino-Russian high-level meeting. 
Everybody will recall that Russian President Yeltsin held 
high-level talks with Chinese leaders during his visit to 
Beijing at the end of 1992. That first contact between Russian 
and Chinese leaders yielded good results. Today, we can 
definitely say that relations between the two countries have 
flourished since that meeting. They cover many aspects of 
state-to- state relations, including economic relations and 
trade, cooperation in military technology, and border issues. 
There is ample reason to believe that bilateral trade volume 
will vastly surpass the highest level of 1982, which was $5.8 
billion. Cooperation in military technology has also proceeded 
smoothly. Here, we would like to specifically emphasize that 
military cooperation between Russia and China is not directed at 
any third country. The Russian-Chinese border issue has been 
resolved without encountering more difficulties. Reductions in 
each other's border troops and confidence-building measures have 
also yielded results. 
  During his visit to Beijing, Kozyrev will mainly discuss 
relations between the two countries. During the visit he is 
expected to sign agreements on border checkpoints and 
consultations between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries. Certainly, the two sides will exchange views on 
major international and regional issues. Furthermore, the 
Russian delegation will acquaint itself with China's experience 
in building special economic zones. These zones have had a 
positive impact on China's economy. In short, Kozyrev's visit 
may score great successes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's historic, "breakthrough" trip to China has brought the 
two countries to more dynamic partnership on the international 
scene and in bilateral relations. China is a high-priority 
country in Russia's foreign policy, declared Deputy Foreign 
Minister of Russia Aleksandr Panov in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS on Monday. 
  The deputy minister said the relationship between the two 
countries should be stripped of all "sensationalism, and should 
just be normal relations between normal neighbors, two 
superpowers" who are cooperating in the interests of each other, 
their region, and the whole world. 
  According to Panov, the fact that the new year is beginning 
with visits by United States President Bill Clinton to Moscow 
and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to China is 
symbolic. Although the delegations are in "different weight 
categories", they reinforce the balance which Russia is 
maintaining in its foreign policy, which is directed towards the 
east as much as it is towards the west. 
  Panov said that Kozyrev's official visit, which is scheduled 
to begin on January 26, will include discussion of preparations 
for a return visit to Moscow by Chinese Premier Jiang Zeming. 
  The potential for Russian-Chinese partnership is great, said 
Panov. In particular, Russia has not paid enough attention to 
China's experience in gradual economic reforms, especially in 
the formation of "special" free economic zones. 
  Talks on the two countries' border are currently being held. 
Panov called "groundless" the allegations sometimes made by 
indvidual Russian statesmen (especially in the Far East), to the 
effect that Russia is making one-sided, unjustifiable 
compromises under Chinese pressure. Whenever the two sides make 
concessions, they are reciprocal, "mutual" concessions. 
  As far as the military sphere is concerned, Russia and China 
are negotiating on the withdrawal of some armed forces from the 
border areas. But these withdrawals would not be of a "sharp or 
sensational nature, since it is more and more obvious that no 
military preparations are being made along the border, which is 
becoming a border of friendship", Panov explained. 
  The deputy foreign minister declared that Russian-Chinese 
trade is mutually profitable and does not infringe upon Russia's 
economic interests. This trade will be continually expanded, he 
said. 
  Panov appealed for more complete information on the two 
countries' relations to be made available to society. Kozyrev's 
january visit to Beijing is destined to play an important role 
in fulfilling this goal.

  [Text] The fishermen of Japan, South Korea, and the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea have received their 
fishing quotas for the central part of the Okhotsk Sea. 
However, Chinese representatives were denied these rights. The 
fact is that, last year, Chinese fishing vessels were often 
involved in poaching in the Russian Federation's economic zone 
which includes the territorial waters of Kamchatka. 
Justifiably, their crews were repeatedly detained by fishing 
protection vessels and coast guard ships.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Historical Sciences Vyacheslav </F>
Kuznetsov: "By Which Standard Should One Judge?..."] 
  [Text] China has always been our great neighbor, and much 
depends on how our relations with it develop. There is vast 
potential for multifaceted cooperation. As long as there is the 
desire on both sides. But is there? And just how profitable is 
it, for example, for us to trade with China today? 
  "The policy of liberalization in foreign economic relations 
is beginning to yield positive results. This is evidenced, in 
particular, by the development of Russian-Chinese trade," 
officials at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations 
say. 
  It is certainly true that the total volume of commodity 
turnover between Russia and China has increased. Russia had a 
surplus in 1992. But in reality things have turned out badly 
for the Russian recipient and consumer. By the end of 1992 the 
rate at which goods were ordered from and supplied by the 
Russian side under the terms of the relevant protocol had 
considerably outstripped the rate at which goods were supplied 
by the Chinese side. As a result, Russian suppliers have not 
received goods in exchange for their exports. Furthermore, in 
the light of Russian exporters' difficulties with the supply of 
complete sets of equipment, the Chinese side is holding back 
with regard to honoring its mutual commitments to despatch goods 
to the Russian Federation. In addition, the Chinese side has 
prevented the Russian side from honoring its commitments to 
supply equipment to the "Suizhong," "Jingxian," "Yimin," and 
"Yingkou" thermal power plants. 
  How should this be viewed? 
  The policy of liberalizing foreign economic activity has 
meant a rejection of the regulating role played by the center, 
which represented general state and national interests. As a 
result of the new policy, trade with China now mainly takes the 
form of border and regional commodity exchange, rather than 
being conducted on an intergovernmental basis (by protocol). 
The participants in this process are nonproduction cooperatives 
and enterprises, and also foreign economic associations at 
regional, city, and rayon level. The basis of this border and 
regional commodity exchange is barter (the exchange of goods for 
other goods). In 1992, the bulk of Russian supplies of trucks, 
tractors, combines, machine tools, and mining equipment, and 
also some power engineering and aviation equipment and spare 
parts, were implemented by enterprises on a barter basis. The 
supply of so-called "hard currency Russian goods" -- 
fertilizers, metals, and commercial timber -- is offset by 
consumer goods imported from the PRC, although these are often 
of poor quality. 
  This also cannot be counted as one of Russia's achievements 
in its trade with China. 
  In 1992 the proportion of decentralized trade in the Russian 
Federation's commodity turnover with the PRC increased from 59 
percent to 90 percent in the space of one year. Moreover, the 
export of machinery and equipment fell from 35 percent in 1991 
to 31 percent in 1992. 
  Liberalization in foreign trade has therefore had a negative 
impact with regard to utilizing production capacity in Russia's 
machine-building industry. Trade with the PRC has not given it 
any incentive to increase output. 
  Barter-driven border trade is gaining in scope. According to 
XINHUA, at the end of June 1993 barter deals between the 
province of Heilongjiang and Russia (and also other CIS 
republics) amounted to 1.51 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 
83.3 percent in comparison to the same period in 1992. At the 
end of July 1992 China had a surplus in border trade with Russia. 
  Current trade relations with China are economically 
disadvantageous to Russia, because border and regional trade 
deals are unevenly balanced. Russian export prices are set too 
low, while Chinese import prices are set too high. In a number 
of cases Chinese companies have deliberately refused to buy 
timber, petroleum products, fertilizers, and metal products 
through interstate channels, instead obtaining them in 
significant quantities on a barter basis. It is quite obvious 
that China is pumping out Russia's raw material resources with 
the aid of border and regional trade. 
  Joint Russian-Chinese enterprises in our Far East are a 
component part of this "border pump." However, the creation of 
these enterprises is seen as an achievement in Russian-Chinese 
foreign economic relations! They are involved in the export of 
natural resources and unprocessed raw materials and in the 
services sector (the hotel business, in particular), according 
to experts from the semigovernmental Japan External Trade 
Organization. 
  But is this activity by joint enterprises in the Russian 
Federation's long-term interests as a whole? After all, we are 
losing irreplaceable natural resources and receiving in exchange 
foodstuffs and consumer goods which have no demand on the world 
market. 
  This kind of trade cannot be described as mutually 
advantageous. According to data for the first half of 1992, 
Beijing was able to improve its overall foreign trade balance as 
a direct result of supplying goods to Russia, by expanding its 
exports -- which began to decline noticeably from January 1993. 
  What about Russian exports to the PRC? As a result of 
capital construction being scaled down in China, our rolled 
steel, machinery, and equipment are not in the demand they used 
to be. 
  According to data for October 1993, the value of unsold 
Russian goods has reached 1.3 billion yuan. Assessing the 
prospects for developing economic cooperation between our 
countries, many Chinese economists regard the Russian Far East 
primarily as a supplier of fuel and raw materials. Strange 
though it may seem, some representatives of Russian economic 
science share these sentiments. 
  Trade between the Russian Federation and the PRC is 
sometimes 
held back for technical reasons. In the first half of last 
year, for example, the plan for freight traffic between the two 
countries was only 62-67 percent implemented, mainly because of 
a shortage of cars and the low capacity of railroad sidings on 
PRC territory. 
  Meanwhile, it was planned to transport as much as 5 million 
tonnes of freight by rail from Russia to the PRC in 1993, 
whereas China was only supposed to dispatch 2.4 million tonnes. 
  The Russian side has volunteered to iron out transport 
bottlenecks by offering to build a passing track between the 
Chinese station of Manzhouli and Zabaykalsk, using its own 
resources. This was announced by Zabaykalsk Railway Chief A. 
Dovgello. Such generosity on the part of officials in the 
Russian railway department would be touching if they were paying 
for the work out of their own pockets. Especially as the 
transport system in rayons bordering on China leaves much to be 
desired. 
  It is extremely interesting that some tend to view the 
export 
of Chinese manpower as an achievement in our foreign economic 
relations. According to XINHUA, in the first half of 1993 the 
province of Heilongjiang alone sent 20,000 Chinese contract 
workers to Russia. To quote SIBIRSKAYA GAZETA, the citizens 
arriving in Maritime Kray from China today "can hardly be called 
the best examples of the Chinese nation." 
  For example, the services of some plant growers from China 
have had to be refused. More than 60 Chinese hired workers have 
been sent back to the PRC early from the "Leninskoye" Peasant 
Farmers' Association in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. When they 
arrived from the city of Tongjiang, the Chinese workers were 
contracted to grow tomatoes and cucumbers on land leased in the 
oblast. However, once they had planted out the seedlings, they 
left the ripening harvest to the mercy of fate and actively 
engaged in commercial activity. They obtained large 
consignments of Chinese goods from across the border and sold 
them at the local market. 
  The question of Chinese contract workers goes beyond pure 
economics. A political problem lies behind it. At the end of 
the sixties the PRC leadership officially made territorial 
claims against the USSR. In particular, they referred to lands 
in the Russian Far East. To this day the PRC Government has not 
retracted these claims. The question of "the lost territories" 
is hyped in various PRC publications, which is reflected in the 
mass social consciousness of the Chinese. According to 
Germany's DER SPIEGEL, the Chinese see their striving for the 
east of Russia as the continuation of a long tradition. 
Historian Huang Dingtian from the Heilongjiang Academy of 
Social Sciences claims that, 140 years ago, large areas of 
Siberia belonged to China, and the Chinese never forget history. 
  According to SIBIRSKAYA GAZETA, the reality is that twice 
as many Chinese as Russians live in Maritime Kray's Pogranichnyy 
[Border] Rayon. All these PRC citizens are living there 
illegally. 
  Our own Russian street traders (known in the jargon of 
today's new "businessmen" as "commuters") do not arouse any 
positive emotions in our neighbors. Every day, several thousand 
Russian buyers descend on northeast China. Once they have 
"stocked up," they hurry home. This is how Russians try to 
ensure their own personal prosperity on the road to a market 
economy! 
  Russian-Chinese foreign economic relations cannot be 
discussed in unequivocal terms. Nevertheless, while living for 
the present, we must not forget Russia's long-term economic and 
political interests.

program] 
  [Text] The United States is appealing to the DPRK to allow 
international inspections of its nuclear sites [haek taesang]. 
An official spokesman for the U.S. State Department has 
reportedly issued a statement making this appeal. Station 
commentator Vladimir Korolev writes on this: 
  What on earth is this story about? The United States is 
insisting that the DPRK should dissolve the suspicion of its 
nuclear weapons development by allowing international 
inspections. Pyongyang and Washington have held talks on the 
nuclear issue. They reached a principled agreement [wonchikchok 
habui] on the nuclear issue through the two rounds of talks. 
  Pyongyang is pointing out that the two military sites [kun 
taesang] of the DPRK cannot be included in the list of nuclear 
inspection targets. 
  Western countries still entertain the suspicion that nuclear 
weapons are being developed in some nuclear sites of the DPRK. 
The United States is persistently saying that it will not 
continue talks with the DPRK unless international inspections of 
some nuclear sites are conducted. In the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks, both sides' delegates should discuss 
improvement in relations between Washington and Pyongyang. 
  The U.S. State Department spokesman has reportedly warned 
that UN sanctions against the DPRK may follow. 
  A treaty on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was 
likely to be signed at every occasion, but the plan for it 
always went wrong. 
  I think it is time to assume a more constructive 
[konsolchok] 
position in resolving the nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Surikov from the "Current Event and </F>
Commentary" program] 
  [Text] Listeners: The Western mass media reported over 
the weekend that Russia is arming Korea [DPRK] and has sold 40 
submarines to them. What is the true story? Here is a 
commentary by station commentator Surikov. 
  First of all, it should be noted that arms sales are now one 
of the major export items of many countries. Commercial arms 
supplies should not be a cause for surprise. Russia's submarine 
sales to Korea are nothing but scrap metal. The intermediary in 
this purely commercial deal is a Japanese company. The 
company's general manager (Shibata) told ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY: 
Last October Russia sold three submarines, which had long been 
decommissioned and scrapped, to Korea. The submarines carried 
no weapons whatsoever. Pyongyang cannot use them for training, 
much less for combat. The most reliable guarantee is that 
representatives from the Russian Navy directly oversaw 
professional Korean workers in breaking down the submarines into 
several parts. The Japanese company did not violate domestic 
laws banning indirect weapons and military technology sales to 
other countries. 
  Speaking at a press conference in Vladivostok, General 
Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy, said: Russia 
has not supplied weapons to Pyongyang; nor does it plan to do so 
(?in the near future). Selling scrap metal to other countries 
is not a secret practice. Many scrapped and disarmed warships 
and submarines are berthed in some Russian ports. (Shibata) 
said: Korea aside, China and Japan are very interested in 
buying such scrap metal. This shows that reports by the Western 
mass media are only rumors that do not tally with the facts at 
all.

  [Text] As Interfax learned from well-informed sources, 
Russia's Foreign Ministry may send a note to Tokyo in connection 
with the recent violation of Russia's territorial waters in the 
area of the South Kurils by Japanese ships. 
  "To write and despatch a note will not take a long time, but 
we do not want to be hasty: the document should be impeccable 
from the point of view of the facts," a senior Foreign Ministry 
official told Interfax. "According to some information, 50 
Japanese ships entered Russian territorial waters. This gives 
rise to the following question: Was it a "demonstration," and 
why were the ships driven out of our territorial waters, instead 
of being detained by Russian frontier guards?" 
  Russia has no intention of staging a confrontation, the 
diplomat pointed out. "That is why we want to obtain an 
objective and full picture of what happened," he said. 
  According to the official, the "incident" will undoubtedly 
be 
discussed, among other things, at the Russian-Japanese 
consultations to be held in Moscow in mid-February between the 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Alexander Panov, and his 
Japanese counterpart, Hiroshi Fukuda. "It has been mutually 
agreed that the exact date of these consultations will be 
announced in Moscow and Tokyo on Tuesday, January 25," he noted.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] A contract under the 
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the 
Russian Federation on the sale of highly enriched uranium was 
signed today at the Russian Ministry of Atomic Power and 
Industry. 
  [Varebrus over video of nuclear explosion and signing 
ceremony] Most people have probably seen a nuclear explosion, 
on television of course, but few will know that the decisions to 
start producing nuclear weapons--and who was to do it, at what 
plants, and what type of technology was to be used--were adopted 
in precisely these premises, in downtown Moscow, on Ordynka 
Street. 
  Now the people against whom these weapons were built, the 
Americans, are right here to sign an agreement to ensure that 
Russia's nuclear weapon potential is used for the benefit of our 
peaceful life. And these objects, even if they look a bit like 
missiles, are just pens which will be used in a few minutes to 
sign a Russian-U.S. contract on reprocessing weapons-grade 
uranium into fuel for nuclear power stations. Over a period of 
20 years more than 20,000 nuclear charges totaling almost 500 
tonnes of uranium are to be processed. The cost of the contract 
is $12 billion. If everything goes according to plan, the plant 
to be built under this contract in the United States will be 
using Russian technology and Russian raw material. [video shows

<F P=106> [Interview with Atomic Energy Minister V. Mikhaylov by </F>
Vladimir Gubarev; place and date not given: "Enthusiastic 
Uranium Deals. Clinton Has 'Donated' $12 Billion to Russia"] 
  [Text] The Moscow meeting between the presidents of the 
United States, Russia, and Ukraine has prompted a number of 
rumors. In Kiev Kravchuk's opponents are claiming that Russia 
"did well out of the uranium deal" whereas the Ukrainian 
president was "sold short." Some people in the United States 
are saying that Clinton "gave away" $12 billion to Russia -- 
this is the amount it is proposed to pay for uranium destined 
for U.S. nuclear electric power stations, which will be obtained 
from our nuclear warheads. Finally, "joyous" hopes have arisen 
in the Russian Government: The word there is that U.S. dollars 
will now come flooding into our country.... 
  I was keen to ask the following questions in an interview 
with Russian Atomic Energy Minister V. Mikhaylov: 
  [Gubarev] How did Ukraine lose out by this deal? 
  [Mikhaylov] The level of Ukraine's security has increased -- 
so in fact Ukraine has benefited. Some of the reprocessed 
uranium from the nuclear weapons will go back to Ukraine in the 
form of fuel rods for the reactors of nuclear power stations. 
You must bear in mind that an extremely critical situation has 
developed in Ukraine regarding weapons and their storage and 
servicing. The weapons which have been delivered to us are very 
dangerous -- scheduled maintenance has not been carried out, nor 
have they been serviced. I will not beat about the bush, I am 
very worried by the weapons situation there -- you simply cannot 
play around with nuclear warheads! It must be clearly 
understood: Ukraine cannot be a nuclear power -- neither the 
technical nor any other conditions exist there. Moreover, if 
Russia were not a nuclear power, in present conditions we too 
would be unable to build weapons or to service them at the 
appropriate level.... Quite honestly, I do not understand how 
people can play political games with nuclear weapons. I am 
convinced that the agreement signed in Moscow has saved Ukraine 
from new "Chernobyls." 
  [Gubarev] What have the Americans gained? 
  [Mikhaylov] They have made several billion dollars on this 
contract. Basically, U.S. uranium-235 enrichment plants are 
defective. Compared with our plants, they are obsolete and the 
technology is substandard. Their enrichment plants are about 20 
times less efficient than ours in terms of electricity 
consumption. Therefore the Americans are closing down their 
enterprises and our fuel is going to their nuclear electric 
power stations. Incidentally, there are approximately 100 
reactor units in the United States. The government is basically 
a "middleman" now, it is reselling our fuel for nuclear electric 
power stations. I think it will make about $3 billion on this 
contract. 
  [Gubarev] What about Russia? 
  [Mikhaylov] The contract benefits us. But not in the 
financial sense. First, the process of dismantling weapons is 
very expensive -- according to expert estimates, it works out at 
$30,000-100,000. The arithmetic is simple, and therefore you 
can see that "fat profits" will not be coming our way.... But 
for me the important thing lies elsewhere: This contract 
enables us to maintain Russia's nuclear industry, retain our 
cadres, and keep our scientific centers. In addition, the world 
will become a safer place: There are currently too many weapons 
at nuclear storage facilities. I am telling you this in all 
seriousness, since all my life I have been involved in 
developing nuclear weapons.... But I would like to reassure our 
fellow citizens: There is quite enough uranium in Russia to 
fully ensure supply to our nuclear power industry and weapons 
complex for many decades to come.

<F P=106> [VoyenTV "Bearing South" video report; from the "Military </F>
Review" program] 
  [Text] Now a few words about one of the most important 
military-political events of the week. Russia and Ukraine, not 
without some help from the U.S. President, have finally managed 
to agree on the future of Ukraine's nuclear potential. 
  At the meeting of three presidents -- the Presidents of 
Russia, the United States, and Ukraine -- Leonid Kravchuk 
confirmed Ukraine would join the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
as soon as possible as a state without nuclear weapons. [video 
carries montage of shots showing troops handling weapons 
components; the "VoyenTV," Ministry of Defense Television Studio 
logo is shown at top right of screen] It is presumed the first 
200 nuclear weapons will be withdrawn from Ukraine to Russia 
within 10 months. Altogether about 2,000 nuclear weapons must 
be dismantled in Ukraine. 
  [Begin Maslin recording] In their statement the presidents 
emphasized the importance of ensuring the security and 
reliability of nuclear weapons until they are dismantled. At 
the same time, the state of affairs regarding nuclear safety on 
the territory of Ukraine continues to worsen. Storage depots 
are packed beyond standard limits with warheads and nuclear 
munitions that have been removed from service. 
  This is intolerable and besides everything else, it has 
brought about a considerable increase in radiation levels. This 
has been confirmed by chief designers from Arzamas-16 who 
visited Pervomaysk on Ukrainian territory in September last 
year. The warranty periods of most component parts have 
expired. [end recording] 
  The signed agreement promises that nuclear weapons, which 
are 
dangerous not only when used but also when improperly stored, 
will stop being used as bargaining chips in political games.

<F P=106> [Feature comprising Vilnius report by Nikolay Lashkevich and </F>
a report by Leonid Mlechin: "Lithuania Takes Fright and Changes 
Foreign Policy Orientation; But This Is Not the Way to Help the 
Russian Minority"] 
  [Excerpts] [Lashkevich] Lithuania was frightened by 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's tough statement about vitally 
important Russian interests in the CIS and Baltic countries. 
Its anxiety was not allayed even by the minister's reassuring 
interview on Ostankino TV. 
  The right is triumphant: Didn't we warn you about Russia's 
true face? The papers are filled with near-panic headlines and 
politicians are trading claims about "Russian imperialism" and 
"Russian expansionism." An official Lithuanian Foreign Ministry 
statement expressed Lithuania's rejection of the "near 
neighbours" concept and concern at what it regards as 
unwarranted accusations of violations of human rights and of the 
rights of ethnic minorities in the Baltic countries (what has 
Lithuania done?) and Russia's reluctance to abandon the practice 
of exerting military pressure on these countries. [passage 
omitted] 
  The anti-Russian mood has increased with the adoption of a 
steely tone by Moscow diplomats concerned about the future of 
the Russian-speaking population. Unfortunately, often it is the 
local Russians who come off worst because Moscow only mentions 
them when addressing lofty diplomatic matters. 
  [Mlechin report] The most unfortunate thing for Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev is not the fact that his speech at the 
conference of ambassadors in the republics of the former USSR 
was not interpreted in the way he would have liked. It is the 
fact that no one actually doubted that the Russian minister was 
now capable of threatening neighboring states. Two years or 
even one year ago diplomats would have decided that there had 
been some kind of mistake and would have sought clarification. 
But this time they believed it. 
  The political complexion of the Baltic politicians is well 
known: Most of them are their own people, who have no love for 
Russia and expect nothing good to come out of it. At the same 
time they dream of getting rid of the hundreds of thousands of 
Russians who have ended up in the Baltic area in one way or 
another since 1940. They are just waiting for an excuse to 
shout: "Save us from Moscow!" 
  If the new tough-talking approach by Russian diplomacy is a 
calculated step, how does Russia benefit? Does it frighten the 
Baltric countries? That is not difficult. But why try to 
frighten them? In the hope of making them more amenable? Of 
changing the policy vis-a-vis the Russian minority? Of keeping 
Russian forces and bases on their territory? Of making them 
abandon the idea of joining NATO? 
  It is easier to achieve the opposite. "If Kozyrev is 
switching to a policy of threats, then the only salvation from 
that kind of Russia is behind NATO bayonets" -- that was the 
conclusion in Riga, Vilnius, and Tallinn, and possibly in other 
capitals as well. 
  How will this conclusion affect the position of Russians in 
the Baltic republics? Any indiscreet word by Moscow is 
interpreted as a direct threat, and hostility toward the Russian 
minority increases. 
  Andrey Kozyrev was better placed than anyone else to foresee 
this reaction. Once former Vice President Rutskoy and other 
state-control dinosaurs [supergosudarstvenniki] were calling for 
strong pressure to be brought to bear on those republics where 
the Russian minority does not feel comfortable. At the time 
Kozyrev said: The position of the Russian minority can only be 
improved by getting on with the states in which Russians live. 
You will not improve their lives by threats and force, let 
alone military force. Russians in the Baltic countries can do 
without being feared and hated. 
  Has Minister Kozyrev changed his tune? Why? Has the 
reality of diplomatic practice scuttled his idealism? 
  Or is the minister caught up in domestic political games now 
that he is a deputy as well? I asked the minister whether he 
himself felt that he was gravitating more toward domestic 
politics? The minister totally rejected this suggestion. But 
there is already talk of "early Kozyrev" and "late Kozyrev," 
with less and less in common between them. Even the minister's 
vocabulary has changed, and he now insists that he was the first 
to say that all the neighboring foreign countries are a sphere 
of Russian interests. Of course, on the one hand, only 
inveterate dogmatists never change. On the other hand, U-turns 
in politics are called a change of course. 
  If Minister Kozyrev thinks that in this way he will be able 
to satisfy those who have not acknowledged the disintegration of 
the USSR and the transformation of the union republics into 
autonomous states, he is profoundly mistaken. As far as those 
forces and parties are concerned, he has still betrayed national 
interests. 
  The point is not that, by abandoning the "early Kozyrev" 
principle, the minister risks losing the sympathies of those who 
have always supported him. Presidential support is sufficient 
for the minister to keep his post. The problem is that the 
Baltic countries and East and Central Europe are becoming a zone 
of anti-Russian activity. And it is the task of diplomats not 
to cause friction between the country and its neighbors, but to 
make them friends. The "early Kozyrev" managed this.

  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- Russian and Uzbek 
delegations held a working meeting at the Russian Foreign 
Ministry on Friday to discuss bilateral relations, the situation 
of ethnic Russians in Uzbekistan and some regional problems. 
  The Russian delegation was headed by Russian Foreign 
Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and the Uzbek delegation, led by Uzbek Parliament 
Acting Chairman Erkin Khalilov, included Kozyrev's counterpart 
Saidmukhtar Said Asymov. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the upper chamber of the 
Russian Parliament, took part in the talks, which were held in a 
friendly and constructive atmosphere. "We met as real friends, 
partners and close neighbours. Our relations are notable for a 
full mutual understanding and close interaction", Kozyrev said. 
  Khalilov seconded this view by saying the two delegations 
should not sit on two opposing sides of the table but at a round 
table with no division between them. 
  In the course of the talks, a decision was reached to 
establish a mixed group of Russian and Uzbek experts to draft 
legislative proposals on citizenship. 
  Kozyrev's political advisor Galina Sidorova told ITAR-TASS 
the negotiations were business-like and its results will lead to 
a practical settlement of problems and mutually acceptable 
decisions.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Russian ultranationalist 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has delayed his trip here this week 
by three days in order to visit Belgrade, Janucz Bryczowski, the 
Polish industrialist who invited Zhirinovskiy said Tuesday [25 
January]. 
  Bryczowski, who heads the National Self-Defense front, a 
small extremist party, said that instead of arriving Thursday, 
Zhirinovskiy would be in Poland on Sunday. 
  He said Zhirinovskiy told him by telephone Monday evening 
that he was concerned for his security while in Poland. 
  Polish interior ministry spokesman Piotr Szczypinski said 
Polish authorities could not guarantee the safety of private 
citizens visiting the country and that there had not been any 
contact with Moscow officials concerning security arrangements 
for the trip. 
  "Poland is a country where foreign nationals are safe," he 
said. 
  Walesa told reporters Monday that he had no intention of 
meeting with Zhirinovskiy. None of the political leaders here 
have expressed any interest in seeing him either. 
  The center-left opposition Democratic Union meanwhile 
announced that it would hold a demonstration in Krakow, along 
the road leading to Auschwitz, to protest the visit. 
  According to Bryczowski, the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic 
Party, is planning meetings with important politicians and press 
conferences during his stay. He will also make trips to Krakow, 
in the south, and the Auschwitz death camp and spend some time 
relaxing in the ski resort of Zakopane in the Tatra mountains.

<F P=106> [Vadim Markushin article: "Who Is Inflaming the German </F>
Imagination?"] 
  [Text] Among recent events, those which alarmed the German 
public most of all were undoubtedly December's floods in Germany 
and the results of the parliamentary elections in Russia. 
  In the first case the reason was clear. Losses occasioned by 
the caprices of the weather have added, in a completely 
unexpected way, to the enormous material costs connected with 
the unification of the country. Once again the state coffers 
are bare; German citizens have never understood the treasury as 
something abstract; for them it is closely bound up with their 
own pocketbooks. 
  The second issue is far more complex. Germany is probably 
the only country in which the announcement of a victory for the 
"right-wing persuasion" in Russia could electrify the political 
atmosphere so completely. This topic has immediately come to 
the fore, opening up clear and -- we must suppose -- long-term 
work prospects for the multitude of experts on Russia. What is 
most staggering for the Germans is the appearance in the Russian 
political lexicon of the word "fascism," which used to be a 
dirty word for Russians. 
  Without considering the extent to which voters who cast 
their 
votes for the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] were 
genuinely linking that party with the possibility of fascism's 
coming to power in Russia, or whether they are pursuing this 
policy deliberately, certain circles in Germany are blatantly 
inflaming the German imagination. Moreover, their efforts are 
to a certain extent being helped along by some of the LDPR 
leader's statements and his behavior. 
  Some people, for example, are already calling for the 
Western 
Group of Forces to be scrutinized more carefully. They are 
saying that the forces are a small piece of Russia, and that 
piece of Russia also contains Zhirinovskiy supporters. Are they 
not likely to make contact with German extremists and thus 
contribute to the cause of uniting Europe's right-wing radicals? 
These fears are not emerging just anywhere, but in the Saxony 
Land Department for the Protection of the Constitution. 
Department head Frau M. Keller said as much to a staffer from 
the Western Group of Forces Press Center: "The department is 
checking to see whether German right-wing radicals have any 
contacts with LDPR supporters in the Western Group of Forces." 
  It seems that those who support unrelenting efforts in the 
military sphere will not miss this opportunity to exploit the 
situation and draw more attention to the Bundeswehr. The 
newspapers have instituted a trend of cursing the government for 
its "lack of concern" in the defense sphere. In the opinion of 
P. Wuerzbach, former under secretary of state at the Ministry of 
Defense, the federal chancellor "is doing absolutely nothing to 
resolve the financial problems facing the Bundeswehr" and he 
"should say once and for all what he can offer the armed forces." 
  There is another curious point which may also be connected 
with events in Russia. One in three German citizens sees 
"nothing bad" about foreign troops being stationed in his 
country. This is the conclusion reached by specialists who 
consistently poll people on the issue. They claim that the 
number of Germans who support the preservation of a foreign 
military presence in the FRG is growing. The researchers 
attribute this phenomenon not only to the traditional 
unwillingness of inhabitants of specific regions to countenance 
the material costs that would inevitably arise from the loss of 
an additional reserve of jobs and stable consumers in the form 
of foreign servicemen. It also has behind it the "NATOization" 
of the consciousness of a population which has grown accustomed 
to linking its own security with the strength of the Atlantic 
alliance, and which particularly reflects on that strength at 
times when there are indications of a threat.

  [Text] The Ukrainian parliament's presidium did not pass 
any resolutions on the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. presidents' 
Moscow statement on nuclear disarmament. 
  What the three presidents discussed and documented in Moscow 
is not an agreement, Chairman of the parliamentary Commission 
for International Affairs Dmitriy Pavlychko told journalists. 
"Therefore, for the moment we can only state our attitude to 
this document," he said. 
  Pavlychko believes that the Moscow statement cannot replace 
the Ukrainian parliament's resolution. Such a resolution can 
only be replaced by an agreement, not by a protocol of intent, 
he said. "We can only ratify an agreement," he added. 
  Pavlychko also believes that the final decision on the 
problem will be made by a new parliament. He said that Leonid 
Kravchuk shared this belief.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General V.I. Yesin, chief of </F>
Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff Operations Directorate, by 
Aleksandr Dolinin; place and date not given: "Missiles Are Not 
Now Targeted at Each Other. But Missilemen's Alert Duty Is Not 
Being Abolished"] 
  [Text] During the U.S. President's recent visit to Russia 
documents were signed on the dismantling of Ukrainian missiles, 
on the respective nontargeting of Russian and U.S. strategic 
nuclear missiles.... 
  All this directly concerns the Strategic Missile Forces, 
which constitute the basis of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. 
To what extent are their tasks being complicated? Is there no 
longer any point to continuous alert duty? Lieutenant General 
Viktor Yesin, chief of the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff 
Operations Directorate, answers these and other questions. 
  [Dolinin] Viktor Ivanovich, will anything change in the 
strategic missilemen's service if the intentions to alter the 
assigned flight missions [poletnyye zadaniya] are realized? 
  [Yesin] They will continue on alert duty. The mutually 
acceptable accord reached on the nontargeting of missiles means 
for us that they will have a "zero" assigned flight mission. 
Day-to-day control of nuclear systems will proceed from the 
premise that Russia, as defined in its military doctrine, 
regards no state as its adversary. We will be threatening no 
one, but this in no way rules out the possibility, in a certain 
situation, of feeding targets into the missiles' control system 
on an order from the supreme commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces -- the president of Russia. This possibility remains, 
and the meaning and purpose of alert duty are not changing. 
Missilemen must always be ready to defend the fatherland. 
  [Dolinin] In connection with the fact that, in accordance 
with the trilateral statement by the presidents of Russia, the 
United States, and Ukraine, the RS-22 (SS-24) missiles on 
Ukrainian territory will be deactivated over the course of 10 
months by removing their warheads, what obligations are imposed 
on the Strategic Missile Forces? 
  [Yesin] In accordance with the agreements reached between 
Ukraine and Russia back in 1993, Russia will provide maintenance 
and ensure the technical safety of the nuclear warheads being 
removed, as well as dismantling them in its own enterprises. 
  If the Ukrainian side shows an interest, on the conclusion 
of 
appropriate mutually advantageous agreements it will be possible 
to salvage the missiles currently in Ukraine at the already 
prepared Russian elimination bases. We have everything 
necessary for this. 
  [Dolinin] What will happen to the missilemen officers in the 
event of the elimination of nuclear missile weapons in Ukraine? 
  [Yesin] Approximately one-third of the officers of the 43d 
Missile Army serving in Ukraine evince a desire to be 
transferred to Russia. There are places for officers who have 
shown themselves to positive advantage during service. There is 
a shortage of officers in the Strategic Missile Forces, 
particularly in primary posts. Things are more complex with 
senior officers. We could take on many, but we cannot at once 
provide them with housing. Today there are more than 8,000 
members of the Missile Forces without apartments. Not 
everything is within our power. 
  [Dolinin] In accordance with the START I and START II 
Treaties, missiles with multiple reentry vehicles are to be 
removed from the effective combat strength of the Strategic 
Missile Forces. Only single-warhead missiles will remain. 
Today these account for only one-third of the missiles on alert 
duty. What will make up for the rest? 
  [Yesin] First, I deem it necessary to point out that 
production of missiles with multiple reentry vehicles for the 
needs of the Missile Forces has been terminated, and within the 
framework of the international accords signed by Russia they 
will be taken off alert duty as the warrantied (service) life 
expires. 
  Second, under the START I and START II Treaties the 
quantitative makeup of the Strategic Missile Forces grouping 
will be reduced. In order to maintain the deterrent potential of 
the Strategic Missile Forces at the necessary level for defense 
needs, work is under way in the Missile Forces in the context of 
life-prolonging technology [po resursosberegayushchey 
tekhnologii] to modernize the missile complex with a 
single-warhead missile. Colonel General I. Sergeyev, commander 
in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, is devoting very close 
attention to this question. On New Year's Eve he chaired a 
state commission session with the participation of general and 
chief designers. It was pointed out there that we are ensuring 
the readiness to begin proving-ground tests of a modernized 
single-warhead missile, which is to replace those whose service 
life has expired -- those, so to speak, which have grown old 
naturally. 
  ...Given all the objective processes and the existing 
difficulties, the future of the Strategic Missile Forces is 
predictable, and the life, activity, and combat training of 
missilemen are proceeding in a planned manner.

  [Text] On 21 January, at a meeting with journalists, 
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk commented on the results of 
the trilateral Moscow statement by the presidents of Ukraine, 
the United States, and Russia concerning nuclear weapons in 
Ukraine. 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] The thing is that we fulfilled 
the 
parliament's reservations. This is a very important element one 
cannot refrain from. [Word indistinct] the executive power was 
following the path of fulfilling the parliament's decisions, not 
blocking them. For example, we were agreeing to certain 
compromises, making certain concessions. [Words indistinct] 
Russia, the United States, Ukraine were doing this. In 
politics, this is the only way to act. Well, generally 
speaking, I expected there would be an opposition [words 
indistinct]. They had not yet read the documents but already 
thousands of them clung to the president and to all the 
executive authorities, so that if I were responding to this, one 
would have never seen me any more. 
  Already they label me as a traitor [words indistinct]. They 
say I betrayed the national interests [words indistinct]. I 
know there are people who always did it this way. But if a man 
who is a [word indistinct] or wants to be a [word indistinct] 
politician, and who strives toward this [word indistinct], then 
I would like the one who says this, who [word indistinct] big 
policy to ponder over the fact that, first, [words indistinct] 
policy is made when they read documents and, second, when they 
take into consideration the situation in the world, take into 
consideration the state of affairs [word indistinct] in the 
world, including Ukraine. [passage indistinct] 
  The one who speculates or calls not to withdraw nuclear 
weapons, to leave them in Ukraine so that Ukraine becomes a 
nuclear state, this can be qualified as follows: [words 
indistinct] independence to Ukraine, and our people [words 
indistinct]. This is why the only correct move by Ukraine is 
the move we make. [Words indistinct] not to lose our strength, 
not to ignore but, on the contrary, to protect Ukraine's 
national interests. But this protection can [word indistinct] 
if there are real opportunities and not just a wish. [words 
indistinct] the one who declares now so loudly that Ukraine must 
be nuclear and that it should not give up weapons, [word 
indistinct] makes Ukraine a hostage and sentences its people to 
death. [end recording]

  [Text] Let us go back to a report by Ivan Gerasyuk and the 
explanation by Stanislav Shushkevich, who proposed to hear Major 
General Konstantin Platonov, deputy interior minister and the 
commander of Interior Ministry troops, today at a 
behind-closed-doors meeting. In spite of the proposal, 
Konstantin Platonov gave no official response. 
  Here is what Deputy Aleksandr Lukashenko, who had a phone 
conversation with Konstantin Platonov, told a BELINFORM 
correspondent. The general said that he received an anonymous 
phone call on Thursday [20 January]. An identified person 
threatened to apply terrorist acts against people's deputies if 
Interior Minister Vladimir Yegorov and KGB Chief Eduard 
Shirkovskiy did not resign. This is the reason Konstantin 
Platonov assumed responsibility and issued an order to put an 
Interior Ministry detachment on alert and move it, unarmed, 
closer to the Government House. When the call proved to be a 
hoax, the detachment was sent back to its permanent quarters. 
  Thus, the presence of an Interior Ministry battalion near 
the 
Music Comedy Theater is a true fact. However, there is still no 
official version on the incident. 
  There remain questions instead: Why was such an important 
decision adopted at the level of deputy minister? Why were 
Stanislav Shushkevich, head of the Security Council, and other 
decisionmaking officials, such as the interior minister and the 
KGB chief, not informed about the threat hanging over the 
deputies?

  [Text] Alain Lamassoure, French minister [delegate] for 
European affairs, is currently on a visit to Estonia. He held a 
meeting with Estonian President Lennart Meri today. One of the 
key aims of Lamassoure's visit is to make preparations for the 
European stability pact's opening conference in the Baltic 
states. For Estonia, the main political importance of the 
European stability pact--or the so-called Balladur 
initiative--comes from the fact that the pact views the Baltic 
states as possible European Union members for the first time. 
  Lamassoure will be leaving Estonia at noon today. He will 
travel on to Latvia and Lithuania.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Lashkevich: "Magnificent Eight Who </F>
Determine Lithuania's Policy"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- President Algirdas Brazauskas' decision 
to request NATO membership for Lithuania has been received with 
approval and some surprise in the republic. The right-wing 
opposition, which had been demanding a declaration of intention 
to join NATO, was somewhat stunned by such a decisive step from 
the current Lithuanian leaders who, from their point of view, 
have pro-Russian sympathies. 
  What made the Lithuanian leadership, which is distinguished 
by a sober, well-considered approach to issues, a habit of not 
hurrying, and an emphatically good-neighborly attitude to 
Russia, become the first of the Baltic countries to request NATO 
membership? What is this: pressure from the political 
opposition? A change in the political situation in connection 
with the elections in Russia? 
  Undoubtedly all these factors played a part. Lithuania, 
irrespective of prevailing conditions, had to choose with whom 
it wanted to be, and say "yes" or "no" to the North Atlantic 
alliance. After long hesitations clarity has been introduced, 
positions have been refined, and the time of uncertainty is at 
an end. Russian troops are stationed in Latvia and Estonia; 
hence they are refraining at the moment from officially applying 
to NATO for membership. Lithuania has nevertheless chosen the 
path of solidarity with these states. The "Partnership for 
Peace" program has not been entirely accepted in Lithuania. And 
many politicians saw in it no guarantees of national security, 
although President Algirdas Brazauskas has given every support 
to this initiative, which is based on gradual entry to NATO 
structures. 
  Lithuania realizes that the republic will not become a NATO 
member for a long time, that this road is very difficult and 
full of pitfalls. The Lithuanian statement bears a highly 
political, even symbolic character, and it would be 
fundamentally incorrect to see it as a manifestation of some 
kind of anti-Russian stance. A hardline reaction from Russian 
representatives will only distance the amicably disposed 
Lithuanian leadership still further. 
  Politicians from the camp of left-wing forces, especially 
from the ruling Democratic Labor Party, advocate all-round 
cooperation with Russia, especially in the economic sphere, and 
support a balanced, cautious policy toward West and East. 
  The right-wing opposition, which is headed by former 
parliamentary speaker Vytautas Landsbergis, accuses the ruling 
party, President Algirdas Brazauskas, Foreign Minister Povilas 
Gylys, their "associate" Kazis Bobelis, chairman of the Seimas 
Committee for Foreign Affairs, and certain other influential 
Lithuanian politicians of excessive tractability vis-a-vis 
Russia, and even of a secret desire to join the CIS. It is on 
this line of disagreements that considerably earnest passions 
are beginning to rage. On the one hand, ardent charges of 
selling out the motherland and independence are heard, on the 
other -- categorical assurances of the complete absence of such 
base designs. The opposition sees the shadow of the Russian 
bear even in the creation of joint enterprises. The Right's 
campaign for a reassessment of foreign policy was stepped up 
after the elections in Russia. Vytautas Landsbergis stated: 
"The new authorities have tried to reorientate Lithuania's 
policy toward the East, and now we see just what this East is 
like." 
  Does the opposition understand that its rhetoric only 
provokes Russia's radicals? The Left believes that the 
intransigent Right, which whips up anti-Russian sentiments, acts 
on the principle of "the worse, the better." In the Right's 
opinion, this tactic accelerates their accession to power in 
Lithuania. 
  Algirdas Brazauskas is perhaps the only political leader in 
Lithuanian whom political opponents are reluctant to criticize. 
This is the effect not only of Brazauskas' personal prestige but 
also of reverence for the presidency. That same Landsbergis of 
the malicious tongue understands that a restrained tone toward 
the president and his post could perhaps enable him to avoid 
indiscriminate criticism in the future, should he suddenly 
become president... 
  Under the Constitution it is the president who is answerable 
to the country for the state's foreign policy activity. It was 
Brazauskas together with Yeltsin who, during the recent meeting 
in Moscow, got the stalled Russian-Lithuanian talks moving again 
and so enabled a whole package of important agreements to then 
be signed. As advisers Brazauskas chose Justas Paletskis -- a 
former professional diplomat and his comrade in arms in the 
Lithuanian Communist Party Central Committee, where he 
supervised ideology and culture -- despite the fact that in the 
difficult days of the former Communist Party he joined the 
social democrats' party and apparently betrayed his former views. 
  The son of a well-known Lithuanian party figure who was for 
many years chairman of the Lithuanian SSR [Soviet Socialist 
Republic] Supreme Soviet, Paletskis is very cautious and adopts 
a well-considered approach to any problem; in short, he acts 
according to the principle "Measure your cloth 10 times..." 
Just as Paletskis was one of the most consistent supporters of 
transforming the Communist Party into a party of the social 
democratic type. Paletskis is generally considered a firm 
advocate of good relations with Russia. His influence on the 
president is very great. 
  But, as the saying goes, render unto Caesar the things that 
are Caesar's: The president elaborates the strategic directions 
of Lithuanian diplomacy with his chief foreign policy adviser, 
but, as a rule, very seldom interferes in the specifics of 
foreign policy. This is typical of Brazauskas in general. 
Unlike his predecessor Landsbergis, who wrote his own speeches 
with his own hand, since he did not like anything that was 
outside his own direct control, and who liked to give interviews 
to journalists almost every day, Brazauskas does not tolerate 
excessive surveillance over anyone, grants more independence, 
shows trust, and never bothers with trifles, or rather, never 
expends his energies on affairs not worth his while. 
  Many a politician in Lithuania was greatly surprised when 
Povilas Gylys, a Vilnius University professor and a man on the 
whole remote from foreign policy, was promoted to the post of 
chief of the foreign policy department. In recent years he had 
headed the department of foreign relations [as published], but 
he had not made his mark in big-time politics. However, it 
quickly became clear that the president had made the right 
choice. Gylys clearly adheres to the foreign policy cause 
elaborated by the Democratic Labor Party, does not indulge in 
unnecessary dabbling or "meddling," and has even several times 
successfully cut down to size impolite right-wing oppositionists 
from the Seimas rostrum. 
  Gylys is also numbered with the "Russophiles," and is also 
charged with secret plans for Lithuania to join the CIS and with 
certain separate deals with Russia. 
  The bitter battle for the foreign political heights in 
Lithuania is also reflected in the fate of the current chairman 
of the Seimas Committee for Foreign Affairs (Kazis Bobelis -- 
yet another highly influential politician). A Lithuanian 
American, a doctor by profession, who lived in the United States 
from 1944 through 1992, he returned to Lithuania on the eve of 
the parliamentary elections. In emigration he headed the Main 
Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania, an extremely 
prestigious organization in emigre circles. The committee was 
dissolved with Lithuania's acquisition of independence and the 
chairman decided to return to his homeland. His homeland 
welcomed him unenthusiastically. Bobelis was betrayed by the 
American habit of calling a spade a spade. He allowed himself 
to speak scornfully about certain third-wave "Sajudis" people 
who considered themselves the only Lithuanian patriots. The 
Right at once recalled his U.S. citizenship, insisting that 
Kazis Bobelis, as a citizen of the United States, had had no 
right to take part in the Seimas elections in which he had won 
his seat. 
  However, the former emigre stood his ground and in the 
presidential election last February he, the number one staunch 
anticommunist, supported the former number one Communist 
Brazauskas. This deepened the split between himself and the 
right-wing radicals still further. 
  Kazis Bobelis has earned the reputation of a man who is 
decisive and independent. Not everyone is capable of leaving a 
home in Florida, where Prime Minister Slezevicius and his family 
spent the Christmas holidays with him, and moving to cold 
Lithuania, which at the time was enduring a power supply crisis. 
  As a sensible man, Bobelis cannot fail to see how pernicious 
the course advocated by some right-wing politicians seeking 
confrontation with Russia would be for Lithuania. 
  If republic Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, Seimas Chairman 
C. 
Jursenas, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius, and J. 
Bulovas, leader of the working group for talks with the CIS, are 
added to the list of major protagonists in Lithuanian foreign 
policy, the composition of the new coordinating council for 
foreign policy becomes clear. It is these "magnificent eight" 
who today determine Lithuania's strategy, coordinate the actions 
of all institutions of power in the foreign policy sphere, 
resolve cadre questions, and guide the work of all Lithuanian 
embassies, six missions, and several consulates general abroad.

  [Excerpts] The State Duma has gone into recess until 1 
February. Today, a day of work, the deputies finished forming 
the parliamentary committees. [passage omitted] 
  They also discussed resuming televising of the Parliamentary 
Hour program. Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Committee on 
Information Policy and Communications, stated that the campaign 
against the State Duma in the mass media is an echo of the war 
which was waged between the fourth estate and the former Russian 
Federation parliament. In order to break this tendency, a 
number of measures must be carried out, the chairman said. In 
particular, a State Duma press center must be set up through 
which objective information could be fed to newspapers, radio, 
and television. 
  As for the Parliamentary Hour television broadcast, the 
committee thinks it would be pointless to have this in the form 
in which it emerged under the former Supreme Soviet. Many 
deputies disputed this stance, however, and as a result they 
made no decision on the matter. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Russian Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, who said 
last week that he was going to resign, appeared in the TV 
program "Itogi" on Sunday to inform that he met Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and got an offer to remain in office. Mr. 
Fedorov said he intended to meet President Yeltsin early this 
week to make a final decision. Boris Fedorov advanced as a 
condition for his continued service for the government the 
resignation of Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who is 
responsible for the agricultural sector, and the Chairman of the 
Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko. For Boris Fedorov, these two 
are a symbol of anti-reformist trends in the government.

  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister

president over the new government composition and said Boris 
Fedorov remains the finance minister for the time being. 
  "There are no and will be no contradictions" with Boris 
Yeltsin. "I have never put my problems on the shoulders of the 
president and I am not going to do that", Chernomyrdin told 
reporters on Monday after a 30-minute meeting with the 
president, adding that the talks focused on the 1994 budget. 
  Boris Fedorov remains the finance minister for the time 
being 
and it is the president who is to decide on his fate, according 
to the prime minister. 
  "Fedorov continues to work in his position. I have not 
accepted his resignation", Chernomyrdin said adding that it is 
the president who is to decide on whether to accept Fedorov's 
resignation. 
  "I do not know whether he will do it", Chernomyrdin said. 
  The prime minister denied press reports that economist 
Leonid 
Abalkin was appointed his adviser. Abalkin was responsible for 
economic reform in the government of former Soviet Prime 
Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov. 
  On Monday Chernomyrdin left for the city of Orel in central 
Russia where he is to meet 18 regional leaders to discuss the 
situation in agriculture.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Robert Serebrennikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- "Abrupt jumps of the 
dollar exchange rate against the ruble on the Russian currency 
market last week were due to the uncertainty about the 
government's policy," Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar said 
in an exclusive interview today. 
  Gaydar said the present exchange rate is being artificially 
maintained in the country. 
  "In December the Central Bank of Russia intervened with its 
own currency resources to prevent the ruble from plummeting," 
Gaydar said. "The main factor which determined the favourable 
dynamics of the ruble exchange rate consisted in a combination 
of high interest rates against the low pace of the money mass 
growth and relatively low inflationary anticipation," he said. 
  One component of this situation is no longer there since the 
inflation anticipation has skyrocketed. "If the second component 
-- the low pace of the money mass growth -- collapses, the 
dollar exchange rate will keep jumping from time to time," 
Gaydar said. But if the government departs from a tough credit 
and monetary policy, the drop in the ruble exchange rate can 
become a dramatic long-term factor of the Russian economy, he 
said. 
  "I think one should be very prudent about attempts at 
maintaining the ruble exchange rate by copious currency 
interventions," Gaydar said. "It was very hard for us accumulate 
official state reserves starting from scratch in 1992 to 4.5 
billion dollars. It would be too dangerous and irresponsible to 
squander them within a few days," Gaydar warned.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Jan -- Russia has put forward a new 
initiative for a political settlement of the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was announced today at a news 
conference by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin. 
  Speaking about the nature of the Russian proposals, he 
singled out three main components of the new initiative. First, 
Russia is proposing "urgent and careful preparations for a 
meeting of the UN Security Council to be held in Geneva, to 
which representatives of the three Bosnian sides, as well as the 
leaders of Yugoslavia and Croatia, would be invited. The aim of 
such a meeting would be to finalize an agreement on peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and to get this document signed. 
  "Second, as part of the process of preparing the session, 
Russia will ask the UN Secretary General to draw up "a detailed 
report on all aspects of the situation in this region, as well 
as the position at the settlement talks." 
  "Third, the Russian side believes that, without waiting for 
a 
meeting at foreign minister level, the UN Security Council 
should now proceed "to prepare a resolution on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose main element would be a demand that a 
cease-fire be strictly observed, that the delivery of 
humanitarian aid should not be impeded, and that the operation 
of the well-known safe zones should be strengthened." 
  Vitaliy Churkin noted that "in resolving the Bosnian crisis 
it is essential to observe priorities and not to let the world 
forget that without a political settlement it will be impossible 
to achieve an in any way satisfactory solution to numerous 
humanitarian issues". 
  Russia's position on these problems, he stressed, is not 
"pro-Serbian, anti-Serbian, pro-Muslim, anti-Muslim or anything 
else of that kind." 
  "Our position is objective and aimed at bringing about a 
political settlement as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina could escalate to the point where 
it would cast its shadow far beyond the Balkan region," Vitaliy 
Churkin declared.

signed by the Ukrainian, Russian and U.S. presidents in Moscow 
on January 25. 
  The Supreme Soviet's presidium discussed this issue in Kiev 
on Monday. 
  Leader of the Ukrainian parliament's working group on 
preparations for ratification of the START-1 treaty, Environment 
Minister Yuriy Kostenko, said on Monday that he saw neither 
economic and military "interests of Ukraine" nor guarantees for 
security in the statement. 
  He believes that "due to this the Moscow statement should be 
considered properly and receive a juridical evaluation." 
  Kostenko explained the fact that the document was signed in 
a 
form of a statement requiring no ratification by the parliament 
as "juridical intriguing" and demanded that deputies determine 
"whether the Moscow statement was useful for Ukraine." 
  He added that the Moscow trilateral statement proposed "in 
fact a new scheme for Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, which 
differs from the one worked out by the parliament." 
  "We are moving towards a non-nuclear status. However, we do 
this in conformity with the interests of Ukraine. The events in 
Moscow represent not only a military but also an economic and 
political split within the country rather than nuclear 
disarmament," the minister believes. 
  He also stated that Ukraine had already withdrawn to Russia 
tactical nuclear weapons together with approximately 10 tons of 
high enriched plutonium and 90 tons of high enriched uranium. 
In his words, 1 kilogram of plutonium will cost about $1 Mn and 
1 kilogram of uranium up to $100,000 on the world market. 
  "This means that today Russia is Ukraine's debtor and not 
vice versa. Russia must compensate Ukraine for the tactical 
nuclear weapons with account taken of the equivalent exchange of 
the cost of uranium for oil and gas."

  [Text] At a ceremony opening the Kiev commodity exchange 
attended by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, journalists 
asked the president numerous questions. Following is the 
Ukrainian president's reply to a question of major concern for 
the entire Ukrainian society -- What are the relations between 
the president and the Ukrainian Supreme Council in the wake of 
the tripartite agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament signed 
in Moscow? 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] We have satisfied parliament's 
reservations. This is a very important fact that could no 
longer be undone. The executive branch was proceeding down the 
path of implementation and not of obstruction of the 
parliament's decisions. Yes, we made some compromises and 
concessions. But how else could you handle this? All of us -- 
Russia, the United States, and Ukraine -- compromised. That's 
how it is in politics. 
  Generally speaking, I did expect to meet with the 
opposition. 
You see, they were making reports from papers, and then they 
called me and the entire executive branch so many names that I 
could hardly be seen from under them. They said Traitor! [word 
indistinct] Sold out national interests! However, none of them 
read the document. I know there always are people like this. 
But you have to be very careful if you want to be a serious 
politician, and be a part of big politics. 
  I want them to know that first, politicians draw conclusions 
only after they have read a document; second, they always reckon 
with the overall situation, possibilities, and [word indistinct] 
of Ukraine. 
  Let me tell you the following -- those who propose or call 
for not bringing nuclear weapons out of the country for Ukraine 
to become a nuclear country [words indistinct] They want to make 
Ukraine a hostage and sentence its people to death. Everyone 
must realize that. And no requests or slogans can change 
anything, because Ukrainian television has recently shown 
ministers, [word indistinct], scientists, and other people. 
They revealed facts proving that Ukraine had made the only 
possible correct step. [words indistinct] we have to do, we 
will do without losing our power and [words indistinct] But this 
[words indistinct] overcome [words indistinct] This might be 
[word indistinct] wish. (?These are the first steps) Those who 
so strongly voice their demand that Ukraine remain a nuclear 
state and keep its nuclear weapons -- whether they want to or 
not -- turn Ukraine into a hostage, with its people sentenced to 
death. [end recording]

  [Text] Plenary meetings of the ninth Ukrainian Supreme 
Council session are continuing. In the morning, deputies began 
debates over the state privatization program submitted to the 
parliament by the Cabinet of Ministers. Volodymyr Pylypko, 
chairman of the State Property Fund, delivered a report. 
Another report was presented by Volodymyr Konopchuk, head of 
the legislative commission for economic reforms. Both deputies 
answered their colleagues' questions. Since the above reports 
and their subsequent discussion contained a number of specific 
proposals, it was decided to revise the plan and to make a final 
decision at the following session. Today, the Supreme Council 
examined and adopted [word indistinct] Code of Ukraine, the Law 
on the State Secret, and the Law on Procedures for Travels of 
Ukrainian citizens in and out of Ukraine. It also approved in 
the first reading the draft law on (?informational protection) 
and [words indistinct]. The session's plenary meeting will be 
resumed on 25 January. On 24 January, deputies will be working 
in legislative commissions on the draft of the state budget, the 
main constitutional provisions, the state authority 
organization, and self-government in Ukraine.

  [Text] Minsk January 24 TASS -- Belarusian Interior 
Minister Vladimir Yegorov resigned on Monday ceding to the 
pressure of the hard-line parliament. 
  Lawmakers' indignation was caused by a scandalous arrest in 
the Belarusian capital Minsk on January 15 of two leaders of the 
banned Communist Party of Lithuania, Mykolas Burokevicius and 
Jozas Jarmalavicius, who were on a wanted list in their republic 
and their further extradiction from Belarus. 
  Another scandal followed when interior troops were sent 
close 
to the building where the parliamentary session was considering 
whether the arrest was legal. Lawmaker Ivan Gerasyuk asked the 
parliament to clear up on whose orders the troops arrived and 
lawmakers demanded to sack the interior minister and the KGB 
chief. 
  The government has adopted the minister's resignation and 
decided to inform the parliament on the matter.

rocket installations several times throughout Friday at the Turg 
height near the 12 and 13 outposts of Moscow's Border Unit on 
the Tajik-Afghan frontier. The enemy gunners were suppressed by 
counter fire. No Russian serviceman was hurt. 
  As an army officer in Dushanbe has told Interfax, the height 
has been continuously shelled for the second day from Tajikistan 
by small groups of infiltrators from Afghanistan. 
  The spokesman reported that two Tajiks were detained when 
they tried to cross into Afghanistan in the Ishkashim area of 
the Gorno-Badakhshan region on Thursday night [20 January]. 
They were unarmed.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 20, BNS -- The next round of 
intergovernmental talks between Estonia and Russia are to be 
held in a location near Moscow on Feb. 1-2. 
  The talks, originally scheduled for Jan. 18-19, were 
postponed at Russia's request after the Russian delegation 
leader Vasiliy Svirin was reported to have fallen ill. 
  The two parties reached agreement on the new date of the 
talks on Jan. 20, said Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian 
delegation. Russia has said it will this time present a detailed 
timetable for the withdrawal of its troops from Estonia. 
  Russia in the last round of talks suggested Aug. 31, 1994, 
as 
the final deadline for the pullout. Estonia has agreed in 
principle with the deadline but says Russia still must present a 
timetable showing the terms for the withdrawal of each major 
unit. 
  The head of the Estonian delegation, Vaino Reinart, has 
earlier said the presenting of the timetable won't affect the 
final deadline.

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Eduard Shevardnadze by </F>
correspondent Nato Oniani; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Batono [polite form of address] 
Eduard, last week you visited France where you signed two most 
important documents -- a treaty on mutual understanding, 
friendship, and cooperation between the two countries and the 
Charter of Paris for a New Europe. How would you assess the 
results of this visit in general? 
  And another question. When we talk about relations between 
Georgia and Iran, Georgia and Turkey, or Georgia and Russia it 
is clear that this is about regional problems and regional 
interests. However, what political interests can Georgia and 
France have in common? 
  [Shevardnadze] Those who had the opportunity must have heard 
some of the assessments I made on the plane and at a news 
conference in Paris. I can state again now that the visit was 
very important. As you know, this was the first official state 
government visit. And the main result, as you said, was the 
signing of those two documents, which laid the foundation of 
law-based relations between Georgia and France. Without this 
foundation, there can be no extensive economic, cultural, 
scientific, or other kind of cooperation, which is something our 
society is so interested in. 
  You know well from our history that in their quest for 
independence guarantees, our ancestors would often turn to 
France. I cannot say that the situation is the same today but, 
probably, one of the most important challenges for all countries 
on our continent is the art of building good relations with a 
country such as France as well as other countries. 
  I think the fact that France is a permanent member of the 
Security Council is very important. The settlement and 
resolution of such complex issues as the conflict in Abkhazia as 
well as other conflicts in the entire [?Caucasus] region and the 
planet depend on France's position. It was very important for 
us to see for ourselves how they understand us in France and 
whether or not we should count on France's support in this 
regard. I must say that there cannot be two opinions that 
France understands Georgia's problems of territorial integrity 
and state unity as well as we do. They take our problems close 
to heart and understand them very well. 
  Now, if we look at this in the context of other countries, 
why, after all, do Georgia and France have common interests? I 
would give a very general answer. This is because they are 
equally interested -- perhaps, we are interested even more -- in 
the building of a new Europe. [passage omitted] 
  [Oniani] The treaty you signed in Paris is not an ordinary 
treaty. 
  [Shevardnadze] You noticed that and told me on the plane 
[from Paris to Tbilisi] that this treaty was slightly different 
from some other treaties. That is right, since it reflects the 
Paris Charter, which we have just joined. As I have said 
before, it was the second time I signed it, but now in a 
different capacity [reference to the signing of the Paris 
Charter by Shevardnadze as Soviet Foreign Minister]. This time 
I did it in Georgian, which is also important. 
  Apart from that, there are direct interests, such as 
economic 
relations with France. Forget everything else, we now subsist 
on EC credits. Once we received 70 million ECUs, then 40 
million was allocated. There is now hope for another 10-15 
million. We can have some hope for the future. We should not 
forget that EC credits do not fall from the sky. They are the 
resources of these European states. The FRG's share in this is 
60-65 percent. I again want to remember with gratitude 
Chancellor Kohl's special appeal to the EC leadership to 
allocate credit to Georgia, which will get us through some more 
time. We should also not forget that France's share in this 
exceeds 20 percent. When I told Mr. Mitterrand that we are in 
economic hardship, he reminded me that France has done what it 
could by contributing its share and supporting the Georgian 
appeal. [passage omitted] 
  I think it was a timely visit and a useful visit. Perhaps it 
came a little too late. However, neither the French nor 
ourselves are to blame for that. There were simply some 
objective reasons. 
  [Oniani] Thank you. Batono Eduard, you have said that your 
position toward the ruble zone will become clear after your 
visits. There have already been two visits. There were visits 
to France and Turkey. In France, you met with representatives 
of financial circles. You met with Economics Minister 
Alphandery and with Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Has your 
position toward the ruble zone become clear? 
  [Shevardnadze] No, when I said: After the visits, I did not 
have only the visit to France in mind. First of all, I had in 
mind Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia and meetings with him and 
his colleagues. A lot will be decided here. However, this is 
not all either. 
  I am planning a visit to the United States, to Washington, 
which will probably take place in the next few weeks [dekada]. 
There will be contacts with the administration, which, of 
course, will be very important. However, my meetings with the 
Monetary Fund and the Reconstruction Bank will also be very 
important. If we receive some kind of a guarantee regarding the 
creation of a stabilization fund, we will then be able to 
struggle with more determination for our national currency, for 
the strengthening of the national currency, and so on. If such 
guarantees are not received, then we should look for another way. 
  Therefore, all options are gradually becoming clear in the 
course of these visits. I have options but I think it is too 
early to speak about them. 
  I do not know whether or not we will return to this topic 
but 
I would like to point out in a couple of words the importance of 
our meetings with regard to the conferment on Georgia of the 
status of a developing country. I do not know if you have a 
question on this. I would say that it was our first contact 
with this institute [not specified], whose headquarters is in 
France. The main result is that we agreed that a large group of 
representatives of this organization will visit Georgia. We 
also agreed on the approximate time of the visit. [passage 
omitted] 
  I would like to remember with special gratitude my meeting 
with UNESCO Secretary-general Federico Mayor. [passage omitted] 
  [Oniani] You had a busy schedule in Paris. There were 15 
official meetings in the course of two days as well as beautiful 
ceremonies [words indistinct]. On the second day of the visit 
you met with Swiss Ambassador Brunner. At the end of the second 
day UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali arrived. 
  We remember that prior to your departure for France you had 
a 
rather difficult debate in parliament in connection with 
Abkhazian issues. Did your position toward Abkhazia change 
after the meetings with Mr. Ghali and Mr. Brunner? Or perhaps 
you became even more convinced that your position was right. 
  [Shevardnadze] These were extremely important meetings. They 
were followed by my request to the minister of foreign affairs, 
Mr. Chikvaidze, and a similar request made today to Georgian 
negotiator Sandro Kavsadze, and Zurab Erkvania, chairman of the 
Abkhaz Council of Ministers, to travel to Moscow. My conclusion 
is that some of our approaches are to be sorted out with Russia. 
Russia has its own version of a UN Security Council draft 
resolution. However, judging by our talk with the secretary 
general, there is a lot of work to be done on this draft. We 
must by all means prepare our own draft. We worked late into 
the night yesterday and it has already been prepared. 
  For me, the purpose of this meeting was to find out how the 
UN secretary-general perceived the peace process and its stages. 
The main element in this process is the adoption of a new 
Security Council resolution. It is important how specific it 
will be and how it will reflect the interests of Georgia as a 
whole, including, of course, the interests of Abkhazia. 
  I must say that many of my colleagues look in a simplified 
way at the adoption of resolutions. Meanwhile, it is a most 
complicated process. The secretary general told me that we 
should not look at this as if Georgia was guaranteed the passage 
of a resolution which would bring peace in a very short time. 
It will be very difficult. There are various drafts. Three or 
four possible drafts were listed, each of which could be 
adopted. However, major and serious work is necessary for that. 
Not only with the secretary general. He gave me a guarantee 
that he would struggle for it to be a perfect resolution which 
will determine the future of peace in Abkhazia. At the same 
time, major work must be carried out with permanent members of 
the Security Council. A plan of how to carry out this most 
difficult activity was also outlined. 
  Of course, I became convinced again that discussing with the 
secretary general any other way of solving the Abkhaz conflict 
but a peaceful one would be simply absurd. And I think that 
rejecting a peaceful way today would rejecting one's own self. 
It is impermissible even to talk about it. Even talking about 
it must be ruled out. If any of the above-mentioned drafts is 
adopted, it will mean that there is a realistic way of 
settlement. 
  I must take issue with some. Those who talk most of a 
military solution think the least about it. Those who think 
that such a solution is possible talk the least about this 
option. That is how it is in general. 
  I think that behind many such statements -- I do not mean 
people who are embittered, those who were persecuted and 
tortured, perhaps this is how they feel -- are partisan and 
selfish interests, which overshadow a realistic attitude toward 
conflict settlement in Abkhazia. 
  I attach extremely great importance to this meeting. It was 
a warm and constructive meeting. 
  [Oniani] You have just mentioned in your answer that after 
the talks with Butrus-Ghali and Ambassador Brunner it became 
clear that we must agree our position with Russia. [Words 
indistinct] financial circles in Paris suggested to us that our 
relations with European countries would to a large degree depend 
on how good our relations with Russia are, whether we like it or 
not. You had talks with many politicians, including the 
president. Does Europe perceive and see the threat which exists 
in Russia? I mean the personnel changes, the increased activity 
of profascist forces, for example, in relation to the French 
president. Mr. Zhirinovskiy spoke in terrible terms about 
Francois Mitterrand. How well do they perceive the profascist 
threat in Russia? 
  [Shevardnadze] I think that behind some politicians' 
statements that Georgia should build normal and good relations 
with Russia, is a great desire to see stability in Georgia. The 
French believe that normal relations with Russia, as we say, new 
relations, are some kind of a guarantee of stability. And not 
only the French think so. In general, Western business circles 
believe that good relations among the countries of the former 
Soviet Union -- and I am talking about Russia's new role in this 
connection; I will return to this subject some other time -- are 
some kind of a guarantee of stability. Business does not work 
without stability and it is natural that financial circles are 
interested in stability. This is the main interest of 
businessmen. 
  Second, as far as the coming to the fore of profascism is 
concerned, which you have just mentioned, my impression is that 
France as well as other countries in Europe and the world are no 
less concerned about this than we are. During our meetings in 
France we again expressed the wish that the democratic way of 
development should be supported in any possible way [words 
indistinct]. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Orel January 25 TASS--Opening a meeting of leaders 
from eighteen regions of central Russia here today, Russian 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin said that its purpose was "to draw 
up a state programme for reviving the regions of central Russia. 
  He noted in his opening speech that the conference should 
now 
devote special attention to the problems of food supply, 
distribution of productive forces, and the development of the 
region's agroindustrial complex. According to Chernomyrdin, the 
state programme for reviving central Russia would be drawn up on 
the basis of the proposals advanced by regional leaders during 
the current one-day conference. 
  Head of the Orel regional administration Yegor Stroyev drew 
special attention in his report to the need of urgently solving 
the problem of the disparity of prices for agricultural goods, 
industrial products, and energy carriers. He said "it will be 
difficult to feed our country" without developing the national 
economy of central Russia. Stroyev pointed out that the 
region's economic problems could be resolved primarily by 
settling the demographic problem, creating motivations for 
productive labour, "otherwise the demographic crisis on the 
territory of Russia proper will become irreversible".

  [Text] Kiev -- A delegation of 10 Ukrainian Government 
representatives flew to Washington yesterday on a week-long 
visit to prepare the ground for a meeting between the U.S. and 
Ukrainian Presidents. The Washington summit between Leonid 
Kravchuk and Bill Clinton, already postponed twice, is 
provisionally scheduled for 12 March. This will be Leonid 
Kravchuk's third visit to the United States as Ukraine's Supreme 
Council chairman and president. 
  The head of the government delegation, Ukraine's Economy 
Minister Roman Shpek, said in an exclusive interview for UNIAN 
before departure: "It is too early yet to speak of the size of 
credits to be granted to Ukraine. However, after hard work with 
the American side and international financial organizations, 
Ukraine can count on a total of $2 billion, including a system 
transformation loan (STL), a stand-by credit, and a 
rehabilitation loan. It is more important to convince the 
American side that Ukraine's leadership realizes the depth of 
the crisis processes in Ukraine and, most significantly, has a 
political will for reforms." 
  Roman Shpek said he hopes to convince the Americans of 
Ukraine's intentions to pursue market transformations by 
fighting hyperinflation, as well as setting up a Ukrainian bank 
for reconstruction and development, and a national insurance 
company to safeguard investments and credits. 
  The delegation also includes Ukraine's National Bank 
Chairman 
Viktor Yushchenko; Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Makarenko; 
Deputy Finance Minister Borys Sobolev; Serhiy Osyka, deputy 
minister of external economic relations; Anton Buteyko, adviser 
to the president of Ukraine for international affairs; Valeriy 
Pavlyukov, deputy minister of machine-building, 
military-industrial complex and Conversion; and other experts. 
According to some reports, Ukraine's Deputy Premier Valentyn 
Landyk and Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko dropped out 
of the delegation at the last minute under pressure from the 
American side. 
  The program of the visit includes meetings at the U.S. 
Congress, the State Department, other departments, the Federal 
Reserve Bank, and the IMF and World Bank headquarters. A total 
of 20 meetings are planned, Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr 
Danylenko [name and title as received] told UNIAN, as well as 
the initialing of a bilateral agreement preventing double 
taxation, and an agreement on promoting and protecting 
investments. These agreements are to be signed during Leonid 
Kravchuk's visit to Washington. 
  "At the IMF, we will discuss the preparation of a program 
for 
STL system transformations, which will become a step toward 
receiving a stand-by loan," Roman Shpek told UNIAN. "If the 
preparation of the STL program proceeds without delay, the IMF 
will hopefully approve the relevant documents in four months. 
At the same time, we will negotiate a rehabilitation loan with 
the World Bank." 
  Confidential sources reveal that the success of the visit 
will also be crucial with regard to the United States granting 
Ukraine a temporary beneficiary status in the generalized system 
of preferences which, as a concession in trade relations with 
the United States, has not been available to any other CIS 
country.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office blames 
Vice Prime Minister Vladimir Demyanov for deliberate inflicting 
ecological damage to the republic, Deputy Prosecutor General 
Olga Kolinko told a press conference in Kiev today. She 
described Demyanov's actions as "illegal and destructive," 
referring to his giving Agriculture and Food Minister Yuriy 
Karasik his personal consent to using the American chemical 
"Harness" in the republican agriculture. 
  She said "such a connivance allowed the American company 
"Monsanto" to fetch in 2,000 tons of this chemical which is not 
even registered in the U.S.A. and is banned for use in Ukraine." 
She also said a criminal case was filed against "state officials 
of the Agriculture and Health Care ministries" on the fact of 
the acquisition of this chemical and production of banned 
chemicals in Ukraine. 
  In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, Kolinko said "Ukraine 
has become a test site for foreign companies where they test 
their chemicals, and moreover, directly on the fields." 
  "Monsanto" representative in Kiev, Vladimir Kudryashov, told 
Interfax-Ukraine that "they did sell some quantity of "Harness" 
to Ukrainian consumers." He said "had the chemical not been 
used last year, Ukraine would not have had such a rich harvest 
of corn." At the same time, he added that the company's office 
in Kiev will sell the chemical only after its registration in 
the republic, supposedly this February or March.

  [Text] Kharkov -- On 21 January, the first land auction in 
Ukraine and the CIS countries to sell the right to lease plots 
of land was held at the initiative of the U.S. State 
Department's Bureau of Development, the United Commodities and 
Raw Materials Exchange, and the City Executive Committee. Due 
to a lack of applications only five plots of land were 
auctioned, all of them with the right to be leased for 
enterprises, instead of the proposed 16, eight of which were 
granted planning permission to build individual houses and eight 
to build market infrastructure facilities. A UNIAN 
correspondent was informed at the Commodities and Raw Materials 
Exchange that only two plots were sold at the auction, 1,500 and 
2,500 square meters in the city center for 700 and 800 million 
karbovantsi respectively. They were sold at three times the 
starting price. It is envisaged that in future such auctions 
will be held regularly. 
  Asked by a UNIAN correspondent to comment on the course of 
the auction, the head of the regional state administration, 
People's Deputy Yevhen Kushnaryov, stated that privatizing land 
by auctioning was quite ineffective because privatization 
processes were "hounded out" to become a shadow phenomenon, and 
were being carried out with official channels by semi-criminal 
or openly criminal methods. In an exclusive interview with 
another UNIAN correspondent, Leonid Vasylchenko, the president 
of the United Commodities and Raw Materials Exchange, noted that 
the auction was held in accordance with the legislation and no 
violation of it was recorded.

<F P=106> [Article by Environmental Protection Minister Yuriy </F>
Kostenko, head of the deputies' working group for issues of 
nuclear disarmament: "We Have Given Away $10 Billion to Russia; 
This Time, It Will Be Even More"] 
  [Text] On 12 January, U.S. president Bill Clinton's 
aircraft touched down at Boryspil Airport. According to 
numerous preliminary tatements by presidential aides and 
advisers, as well as by the U.S. press, the visit had not been 
planned. The press hailed Bill Clinton's intention to visit 
Minsk and Moscow and asserted that he was not going to visit 
Kiev because Ukraine was not behaving properly on the nuclear 
issue. They said that Ukraine would later be summoned to Moscow 
for negotiations. However, the boss of the White House changed 
his decision -- Kiev's airport was the first of those of the 
former Soviet republics to receive him. The president took a 
step backward, but now he wants to take two, three, or four 
steps forward. 
  Against the background of the victory of Zhirinovskiy's 
party 
in Russia, the sensational reports on the total elimination of 
nuclear weapons in Ukraine do not only give rise to a series of 
questions, but also to the feeling of anxiety and uncertainty 
among the citizens of our, and not only our, state. 
  One cannot fail to see the perfectly obvious contradictions 
between the decisions adopted by the Supreme Council on the 
reduction of nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian land and some 
statements in the agreement about to be signed by the presidents 
of the three states. For example, in accordance with the 
Supreme Council decree on the ratification of START I, Ukraine 
takes upon itself an obligation to destroy 42 percent of its 
nuclear warheads over seven years. Before he arrived in Kiev, 
Clinton declared in Brussels that all the warheads would be 
removed from our territory in the coming two or three years. 
Therefore, if such an agreement is signed, a quite logical 
question arises: "Why should Ukraine fulfill all those 
extremely unprofitable procedures for destroying strategic 
offensive weapons as envisaged by START I? It is known that its 
theses were elaborated more than 10 years ago, when the USSR, 
which manufactured nuclear weapons, was still in existence. 
  The absence at that time of the effective mechanisms for 
control over the manufacture of nuclear warheads led to the 
elaboration of such operations for destroying strategic nuclear 
forces, which could be clearly pinpointed and controlled. It is 
precisely for that reason that, in accordance with the 
agreement, the account for destroyed strategic weapons is made 
in terms of dismantled launch vehicles and destroyed launch 
silos and not in terms of destroyed nuclear warheads. 
  Incidentally, with regard to the latter, the practice of 
dismantling a training launch silo in Pervomaysk showed that the 
real economic and ecological losses exceeded the worst 
predictions. All those who saw the photographic illustration of 
this barbaric action in IZVESTIYA of 11 January 1994 could judge 
for themselves. 
  Well, in view of the fact that Ukraine does not manufacture 
its own nuclear warheads, the removal of nuclear warheads from 
our territory also automatically signifies the elimination of 
the strategic offensive weapons. Even if entire strategic 
missiles remained in complete launch silos, with such a missile 
we would, perhaps, be able to launch, instead of a nuclear 
warhead, nothing more than nuclear waste from the Chernobyl 
sarcophagus. 
  However, here a clear position is necessary -- either we 
pursue a stage-by-stage reduction of our nuclear arsenals in 
accordance with previous terms, or destroy nuclear warheads 
alone without ruining those things that may still serve our 
state, namely the launch vehicles and the launch silos. 
  Yet another important issue with regard to new initiatives 
is the problem of compensation for nuclear disarmament. The sum 
of material assistance promised by Mr. Clinton cannot be 
compared to the losses that Ukraine has sustained. I will 
analyze just one aspect of this problem. The highly enriched 
uranium and weapons-grade plutonium are the most valuable 
materials of the nuclear warhead. It is impossible to determine 
the market price of these materials, because their sale is 
forbidden by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. At the same 
time, in accordance with some estimates, the known expenditure 
on the production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium are, 
respectively, up to $100,000 and up to $1 million per kilogram. 
Together with the tactical weapons, Ukraine has already handed 
over to Russia more than 50 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium, 
which, according to the minimum estimate, is worth over 
$10 billion. This indebtedness of Russia to Ukraine would be 
enough to compensate for the deliveries of energy resources to 
us for more than a year. 
  As regards the new agreement, the proposals that the highly 
enriched uranium from the strategic missile warheads be 
processed at Russian enterprises and that Ukraine be repaid with 
low-grade uranium in the form of fuel for nuclear power stations 
are economically unprofitable for Ukraine. The low-grade 
uranium is worth about a hundredth of the highly enriched 
uranium. On the other hand, in accordance with the concept of 
the development of nuclear power engineering in Ukraine, it 
would be economically expedient to manufacture our own fuel 
cartridges for the nuclear power stations. It would, therefore, 
be best to process highly enriched uranium in Ukraine. This is 
corroborated by the proposals from the well-known U.S. General 
Atomic Company, which proposed that a joint enterprise on 
manufacturing fuel for nuclear power stations be organized in 
Ukraine. 
  The cost of such an enterprise would be just $30 million. 
Besides, after completing the program for processing the highly 
enriched uranium into low-grade uranium, this enterprise might 
be used within the technological cycle of our own capacities for 
manufacturing fuel for nuclear power stations. Unfortunately, 
the leadership of our state ignored these proposals. It is 
necessary to return to this issue. 
  One more commentary on the new initiatives. The fact that 
Ukraine is presently in a certain degree of international 
isolation is not due to nuclear weapons, as some people are 
trying to prove, but to the absence of any reforms. That is 
why, had there been conditions in Ukraine favorable for 
efficient entrepreneur activity and not stagnation with 
corruption and bribery, there would not have been such a thing 
as the so-called "Ukrainian syndrome," which allegedly scares 
away investors. 
  Speaking about the nuclear weapons of the former USSR, 
Western entrepreneurs and politicians are not so much concerned 
about the availability of nuclear weapons, as about the possible 
coming to power in Russia of Mr. Zhirinovskiy.

  [Text] Tokyo January 25 TASS -- Ukraine plans to announce 
at the regular CIS summit this March its decision to accede 
fully to the economic union of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (CIS), Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valentin Landyk told the 
Japanese newspaper "NIHON KEIZAI". His interview is published 
in today's issue of the daily. 
  "The Ukrainian leader," the newspaper says, quoting his 
pronouncements, "has stressed that his republic should rely 
primarily on relations with the states of the former Soviet 
Union and the East European nations in order to improve the 
economic situation in the country. 
  "To make the CIS economic union function effectively," 
Landyk 
believes, "it is necessary, first and foremost, to create a 
system for mutual settlements, based on a specialised 
inter-state bank."

  [Text] On behalf of the Black Sea Fleet Command its press 
center expressed apprehensions in connection with some 
statements made by the Ukrainian Defense Minister, General 
Vitaly Radetskyy. 
  On January 20 the newspaper KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI published a 
report on the meeting between Radetskyy and top officials of 
mass media in Kiev on January 18. During the meeting, the 
newspaper says, Radetskyy stated that he "would not like to 
liberate Crimea like the Americans liberated Kuwait." 
  Approving the fact that the general had no such an 
intention, 
the Black Sea Fleet press center at the same time "considers the 
mere idea of holding any military operations on the peninsula to 
be dangerous." 
  The Black Sea Fleet Command hopes that military exercises of 
the Ukrainian Armed Forces from January 24 to January 27 have no 
relation to the above mentioned quotation and to presidential 
elections in Crimea. 
  According to the combat preparation plan of the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces for 1994, from January 24 to January 27 the 
exercises on territorial defense will be held under the guidance 
of the commander-in-chief, President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. 
During the exercises the Armed Forces will work on the 
interaction of the armed forces, the national guard, the border 
and the civil defense troops. There will be no large-scale 
movement of troops.

  [Text] Brussels, 21 Jan -- Volodymyr Vasylenko, Ukraine's 
ambassador to the Benelux countries, met Ambassador Napolitano 
[name as received], coordinator of EC/CSCE sanctions against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The sides discussed a wide 
range of issues connected to Ukraine's participation in 
implementing UN sanctions against Yugoslavia. Individual 
attention was paid to cooperation by the customs and border 
services of Ukraine with the authorities of Danube countries and 
with the missions for facilitating sanctions in these countries, 
and to the possibilities of rendering financial and technical 
assistance to Ukraine, which is needed for efficiently securing 
the sanctions regime. 
  The Ukrainian ambassador drew Napolitano's attention to the 
necessity of stepping up the search for practical ways of 
compensating losses experienced by third countries, including 
our state, as a result of introducing sanctions against 
Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Kiev -- Volodymyr Pryadko, chairman of the board of 
the State Property Fund of Ukraine, reported at the plenary 
session of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 21 January that in 
accordance with the draft state privatization program, there are 
plans to privatize 20,000 facilities of unfinished construction 
and 8,000 medium and large enterprises in 1994. It is 
envisioned that as a result of implementing the proposed 
program, the share of the non-state sector in the economy will 
come to 28 percent and that the state will receive over 21 
trillion karbovantsi and approximately $230 million. Delivering 
a report, Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the Supreme Council 
commission for issues of economic reform and management of the 
national economy, mentioned 11 observations regarding the draft 
of the said program, and stressed the necessity of applying 
administrative penalties to officials who disregard the 
privatization process. After Supreme Council commissions have 
elaborated the draft, taking into account proposals expressed by 
people's deputies during the discussion, it will be resubmitted 
for hearings during the next plenary cycle of sessions. 
  A law "On the procedure for leaving and entering Ukraine for 
citizens of Ukraine" was adopted. It envisions simplification 
of the procedure for formalizing exit documents. Speaker 
Valentyn Nedryhaylo, first deputy minister of internal affairs 
of Ukraine, replied to questions on the investigation in the 
affair of the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, head of the 
People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh] secretariat. Four main 
versions of the disappearance are being worked on, additional 
ones have appeared, and Interpol and investigative bodies from 
CIS countries have joined the investigation, but so far, 
according to Valentyn Nedryhaylo, "new signals have not been 
received." A law "On state secrets" was adopted without 
fundamental changes; the law "On data protection in automated 
systems" was approved in its first reading, and the Forestry 
Code of Ukraine, which was adopted, will come into force from 
the day of publication. 
  The next plenary session of the Supreme Council will take 
place on 25 January.

  [Excerpts] Kiev, 20 January -- At the session of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council, First Deputy Economy Minister 
Valentyn Popov delivered a report on the plan of the social and 
economic development of Ukraine for 1994. 
  Popov pointed out that the crisis in the country has 
exacerbated. According to preliminary data, the gross domestic 
produce in 1993 was just over 104 trillion [figure as received] 
karbovantsi, down 15 percent from 1992. 
  On the subject of privatization, Popov noted that the 
process 
of privatization accelerated at the end of last year. Of the 
total number of the facilities privatized, 1,070 were 
state-owned and 1,554 in communal ownership. 
  As for the official karbovanets exchange rate, Popov 
informed 
the audience it was planned that the karbovanets exchange rate 
would be raised to 16,000 karbovantsi to a dollar this year by 
increasing production, maintaining coal prices throughout the 
year, and lowering the norm of money income by 20 to 25 percent. 
  It was envisaged that prices this year would rise by 4.45 
percent. 
  It was also envisaged that 28 million tonnes of oil, almost 
84 billion cubic meters of gas, and 16.8 million tonnes of coal 
would be imported and 437 million dollars worth of nuclear fuel 
purchased this year. [passage omitted] 
  Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko reported on the draft 
state budget for 1994. 
  The budget submitted makes no provision for deficit, with 
both its revenue and expenditure at 352.1 trillion karbovantsi. 
  In the budget, it is planned that 112 trillion karbovantsi, 
or 37.6 percent, will be allocated to social security and the 
socio-cultural sphere, 37.4 trillion to education, almost 100 
trillion to financing the national economy, and almost 16.9 
trillion to defense needs. Provision is made for an additional 
1 trillion to be allocated to eliminating and reducing strategic 
offensive arms. It is planned that 15.8 trillion will be 
allocated to the needs of Chernobyl. 
  Three trillion karbovantsi were allocated to the needs of 
executive power and 384.4 billion to the maintenance of the 
Supreme Council. 
  A 30 percent reduction in the executive power apparatus and 
a 
62 percent increase in the apparatus of the Supreme Council are 
planned.

<F P=106> [Journalist Konstantin Marchenko report: "Ukraine Will Have </F>
Its Own General Staff and Will Remain a Space Rocket Power, 
Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy Declared"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- The reforming of the Ukrainian Armed Forces 
is complete, the Ukraine's army general told journalists. The 
plan for their organizational development, which consists of 
three stages, is starting to be implemented. 
  The plan has been designed through the end of 1995. The 
independent state's Army will finally acquire its own budget. 
The minister confirmed that by that time the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces will have a strength of 450,000 men. The Main Staff is 
being transformed into the General Staff, although the general 
complained of a certain shortage of cadres, particularly in the 
operational-strategic component. He reported that foreign 
experience, including Russia's, had been taken into account in 
the process of forming the General Staff. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy described as correct the decision on the 
nuclear weapons located on Ukrainian territory. He emphasized, 
however, that Ukraine is a space rocket power, since it is 
capable of manufacturing its own rocket to put a satellite into 
orbit. The minister said that Ukraine must create modern 
deterrent forces equipped with highly accurate weapons. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy drew his audience's attention to the 
problem of reducing conventional arms in accordance with the 
1990 all-European treaty. He believes that these quotas are 
rather too low now, after the breakup of the USSR. Not only for 
Ukraine but also for Russia, particularly on the southern flank 
of its defense. The minister proposed two ways out of the 
impasse: a revision of the accords or the creation of new types 
of arms. In artillery, for example, if the reductions affect 
guns with a caliber of 100 mm and above, then guns with a 
caliber of 99 mm should be put into production. 
  The minister described the problem of the Black Sea Fleet as 
very complex. He declared: "It is closely connected with the 
situation in Crimea. I, a Ukrainian citizen, believe that there 
can only be one president in our state. I believe that it will 
be harder to find the solution here than in the case of nuclear 
weapons." Vitaliy Radetskyy ruled out the possibility of an 
armed conflict in Crimea and also the possibility of Russia's 
strong-arm intervention. 
  He also emphasized the nonbloc nature of Ukraine's military 
policy, stressing that it has no intention of being a younger or 
middle brother but intends to build equitable relations. He 
cited as an example Uzbekistan, which is prepared to supply 
cotton uniforms in exchange for Ukraine's repairing its military 
hardware. Turkmenistan is prepared to pay with oil and gas in 
exchange for the training of military cadres.

<F P=106> [Borys Lyubyaz report on news conference by Ukraine's </F>
Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy; place and date not given: 
"We Are a Great Space-Missile Power"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy held a news 
conference for leaders of the mass media. In a free and easy 
atmosphere, the minister briefed journalists about the problems 
with which the personnel of Ukraine's Armed Forces are 
confronted. Analyzing the past year, the minister listed, among 
positive aspects, the fact that the Armed Forces have finally 
received their Military Doctrine, specified their numerical 
strength, and appointed Armed Forces Day -- 6 December. Over 
the last year, the Supreme Council, president, and government 
issued about 100 laws, decrees, edicts, and directive dealing 
with the army. Temporary statutes for the troops were adopted. 
  Much has been done for the reduction of the Armed Forces. 
While at the end of 1991, there were 726,000 military 
formations, their number has now decreased by one-third. The 
reduction will continue. By the end of 1995, the Armed Forces 
will have 450,000 servicemen. 
  By now, 603 tanks, 630 infantry fighting vehicles [IFV] and 
armored personnel carriers, as well as 750 helicopters and 
aircraft have been scrapped. By the end of 1995, Ukraine will 
have up to 4,080 tanks, 5,050 IFV, 4,040 units of artillery, and 
1,090 aircraft. 
  Ukraine is fulfilling a peace-keeping mission in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Recently, the Supreme Council adopted a 
decision to increase the numerical strength of the Ukrainian 
battalion there to 1,220 persons. In this connection, yet 
another battalion is being brought up to strength and contracts 
are being concluded with servicemen. This means that 
regular-service soldiers will not be enlisted for this 
subdivision. The defense minister expressed surprise that 
parents are asking their sons to be sent precisely to that 
dangerous region. 
  "Perhaps, because their income is greater than yours," 
suggested one of the journalists. 
  The minister made a calculation: "If a soldier receives 
between $500 and $600 a month, whereas the minister's salary is 
$67, the reason for the enthusiasm may well be understood." 
  The army still has no single command system. When it is 
created, and this will take place between 1995 and 1996, the 
air-defense and air force troops will be unified. 
  At present, the army is in the process of introducing the 
Ukrainian language. At any rate, the orderly officers in 
subunits report in the state language, and the combat training 
also proceeds with the help of the Ukrainian language. The 
problem lies in assimilating the military terminology. 
  The minister fully supported the Ukrainian president's 
concluding the tripartite agreement, because nuclear warheads 
are deployed in our troops, but they are controlled and also 
serviced outside Ukraine. Why should Ukraine need weapons, 
which cannot help, but only create problems, which cannot be 
resolved by us. Isn't it better to transfer them away from 
Ukraine? All the more so since the state will receive 
compensation for them. 
  At the same time, Ukraine remains a great space-missile 
power. We have everything necessary for creating missiles, which 
may be launched into space. We are capable of launching 
artificial satellites for communication purposes, for 
agricultural needs, and, it goes without saying, for resolving 
military problems. 
  The minister also touched upon numerous questions of 
military 
building and answered journalists' questions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Atomic Electric Power Plants [AES] </F>
Are Coming to Our Help"] 
  [Text] As reported by Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic 
Energy, last year, Ukrainian nuclear plants produced 75,238,900 
kilowatt/hours of electricity. This is 111 percent of what was 
planned. The energy output of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power 
station accounted for 42.76 percent of the total amount of 
electricity produced by all the nuclear power stations. 
  At the same time, the extension of the period of maintenance 
work at the Khmelnytskyy nuclear power station and individual 
faults in the operation of all of the nuclear power stations led 
to the failure to produce 8,071,110 kilowatt/hours more. Last 
year, a total of 239 accidents were recorded at nuclear power 
stations. As a result of 62 of them, power units were halted, 
and 109 led to power reductions. None of the accidents involved 
an increase in the radioactive background at the stations or 
around them. 
  In 1993, the share of the energy produced by Ukrainian 
nuclear power stations increased again. While in 1990, it 
amounted to 25.7 percent; in 1991 -- 27.1 percent; and in 1992 
-- 29.4 percent; in 1993, it reached 32.9 percent. Since 18 
January 1994, five Ukrainian nuclear power stations have been 
producing 42 percent of the total daily output of electric 
energy. Problems with deliveries of organic fuel are making 
themselves felt.

  [Text] Kharkov -- On 21 January, the first all-Ukrainian 
conference of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms began its work 
in Kharkov. Taking part in it are more than 600 representatives 
of the regional organizations of political parties and 
movements, entrepreneurial and industrial structures, 
foundations and public organizations from Odessa, Poltava, Sumy, 
Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Zhytomir, Nikolayev, Kiev, and other 
cities of Ukraine. One of the co-chairmen of the bloc, 
Volodymyr Hrynyov, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman of 
the "Nova Ukrayina" [New Ukraine] association, emphasized that 
the goal of the future strong parliamentary coalition, which the 
bloc expects to reach at the March election to the Supreme 
Council, should be order and the market in Ukraine. He believes 
that ways toward this lie in privatization, improvement of the 
financial system, establishment of equal economic relations with 
Russia, changes within the authority institutions, and the 
priorities of the private sector. The conference is planned to 
approve an appeal of the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc to the citizens of 
Ukraine on the election eve and a "Declaration on the goals and 
principles of the activity of the Interregional bloc of 
reforms." The four fundamental provisions of the 
"Declaration..." envision the following: priority of human 
rights and freedoms, creation of a civilized market society in 
Ukraine on the principles of private ownership of land and the 
means of production, refusal from any attempts to build a state 
with national and ethnic priorities, refusal of the policy of 
confrontation with Russia and other CIS countries. Also, the 
conference delegates will take part in the work of the "Kharkov 
Business Assembly."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skachko report: "Ukraine Should be Russia's Ally. </F>
Kuchma-Grinev Bloc Conference Begins"] 
  [Excerpt] The first All-Ukraine Conference of the 
Interregional Bloc of Reforms [IBR] created by former parliament 
speaker Volodymyr Grinev and Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma 
started work on 21 January 1994 in Kharkov. The objectives of 
this event were clearly defined by Volodymyr Grinev: first, to 
create an organ that would coordinate the activities of regional 
structures of the IBR. Second, to draw up program-concept 
documents that could be offered to voters. Third, to set a date 
for the next conference, which would determine the optimum line 
of conduct for candidates for election as people's deputies. 
  Grinev, who read out a report, clearly defined the IBR's 
strategic line -- orientation to the regions because it is they 
that come to the fore in the real processes taking place today 
in Ukraine, while "the sum of the center's errors has exceeded 
the level beyond which these errors constitute a threat to the 
state." Grinev defined as one of the IBR's main tasks "to 
transfer managerial cadres from the regions to the center." 
According to Grinev, the bloc's banner should be order and a 
market system in which a market-based economy based on the 
inviolability of private property would function in full 
measure, and state authority would efficiently control all the 
processes in society. Volodymyr Grinev motivated his point of 
view by the fact that Ukraine would yet for a long time have 
this peculiar dualism: the coexistence of the private and 
government sectors of the economy. 
  Grinev also defined three main principles of the 
interregional bloc's activity. First is a market-based economy 
which is supposed to pass the three stages: financial 
stabilization, privatization, and structural adjustments. 
Second, the development in Ukraine of a multinational state 
which would realize the interests of the entire population 
rather than those of some ethnic groups. Third, Ukraine should 
proceed from the fact that it is a strategic and geopolitical 
ally of Russia. This strategic alliance, according to Grinev, 
consists in the fact that Ukrainian goods would for a long time 
find only Russian markets, and Ukraine and Russia can and should 
act as stabilizing factors in Eastern Europe and to assist its 
speedy integration in European processes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kharkov -- On 22 January the all-Ukrainian 
conference of the Interregional reform bloc (the Hrynyov-Kuchma 
bloc) ended with a meeting of the Kharkov business assembly. 
The conference approved a program of actions "Ukraine's path 
toward economic revival, a civil society and civilized state," a 
declaration about the aims and principles of the bloc's activity 
and an appeal to Ukraine's citizens. At the basis of these 
documents lies the assertion of the indisputability of immediate 
economic reforms in Ukraine and of normalizing economic 
relations with Russia and other CIS countries. At the next 
conference which is planned for the end of February in 
Dnepropetrovsk, there will be a gathering of parliamentary 
candidates who have been nominated and supported by the bloc. 
  At a news conference after the end of the assembly, people's 
deputy and co-founder of the bloc Volodymyr Hrynyov, stressed: 
Democratic and centrist forces do not have the right to lose the 
upcoming elections; young and energetic political leaders from 
the regions where, in his opinion, the state's new economic 
policy will be formed, should be elected to the new parliament.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 24 January carries a 20-minute 
pre-election program with people's deputy Stepan Khmara, leader 
of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party, followed by Mr. 
Bazelyuk, cochairman of the Civic Congress of Ukraine. 
  Khmara starts by saying that the Ukrainian people have 
achieved their long-time aim of independence but unfortunately, 
in the two years of independence, Ukraine has experienced 
poverty while a small group of "swindlers" and "criminals" has 
become rich very quickly. He adds that these criminals have even 
succeeded in penetrating the power structures. He blames the 
present difficulties on the people in power and outlines the 
reasons why this occurred: "The basic political issue, the issue 
of power, was not resolved. The old and most corrupt members of 
the nomenklatura remained in power. Its behavior is impudent. 
They quickly plundered the national wealth." To prove his point 
he says: "Even ministers and those like former Minister of 
Energy Sklyarov, who is now abroad and also a minister of the 
Cabinet of Ministers and personal friend of former premier 
Kuchma has left state employment and is living in France on 
plundered funds. The list is endless." Khmara goes on to say 
that it is only through a change in power that effective 
economic reforms may be introduced. These could give the people 
an opportunity to live off the wealth which it creates. He 
speaks out in favor of private property saying that 
privatization should be a means of giving people the opportunity 
to realize their right to private property and not simply an end 
in itself. "We support widespread reforms in the agricultural 
sector of the economy that is of strategic value to Ukraine, but 
we are categorically against selling land to foreigners. We 
support the creation of real cooperatives and also of conditions 
for private farming. We support the revival of historical and 
social justice, that is, so that peasants have the right to own 
land, that there should be a market in land. They should be 
able to either bequeath it or sell it." 
  Stepan Khmara also dwells on the problems of Ukraine's 
security focusing chiefly on the joint statement signed by the 
presidents of Ukraine, America and Russia on 14 January in 
Moscow. By signing the statement, President Kravchuk "in effect 
carried out an act of capitulation, acted in contravention of 
Ukraine's national interests, inflicted significant losses to 
the national security and violated those legislative acts which 
Ukraine's Supreme Council had approved, in particular the 
resolution of 18 November 1993, according to which Ukraine would 
nevertheless remain a nuclear state but would not contravene the 
treaty on reducing nuclear weapons," says Khmara. He goes on to 
accuse President Kravchuk of "committing a state crime" 
according to the article 56 of the criminal code. This, he says, 
is state treason. It is possible, he adds, for Ukraine to 
develop its own system of controlling nuclear weapons and it 
could be done in a short space of time. Failure to possess 
nuclear weapons could lead to a "loss of statehood and authority 
in the international arena." It is not necessary to wait for 
the elections to change things, says Stepan Khmara. Ukrainians 
could try to impeach the president, demand the dismissal of his 
entourage, and put the president on trial. For this reason, 
says Khmara, "I call on Kievites to go to the Supreme Council 
tomorrow, to express your resolute will because tomorrow this 
issue will be examined by the Supreme Council and you should 
say, yes to a nuclear status for Ukraine and say away with 
Leonid Kravchuk and his criminal entourage." 
  The second part of pre-election broadcast program features 
10-minutes of remarks by Mr. Bazelyuk, cochairman of the Civic 
Congress of Ukraine. 
  Sharply critical of the independence of Ukraine, its results 
after two years, and the mere need for it, the speaker says that 
the Ukrainian people's living standards after two years of 
independence have gone down ten-fold, being now threatened by 
"famine, poverty and cold," aggravated by the general decline in 
the economy, hard hit by the energy crisis, growing 
unemployment, delays in paying wages, and deterioration of 
educational, cultural, and scientifical standards. 
  On the subject of the nuclear disarmament deal, signed by 
the 
Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. presidents in Moscow on 14 January, 
he proclaims that Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is a "man 
of no consequence summoned up to Moscow" to sign the deal and is 
-- together with President Boris Yeltsin -- totally subordinate 
to President Clinton, "something like a general secretary to 
them, except that the Central Committee is now in Washington". 
  Regretful about the grandeur of the former USSR in general 
and on the arms trade market as a major source of state revenue 
in particular, he denounces "the bureaucracy" as "a traitor" to 
the Motherland, that disintegrated the Soviet Union "as the 
result of a criminal conspiracy." Saying that the collapse of 
the Soviet Union puts Western democracies at advantage, he 
points out that "it is much easier to deal with leprechaun 
states that merely have an appearance of being independent but 
can in reality be oppressed and colonized." He once again 
suggests that "it is now after all the bureaucracy that is the 
adversary of Ukrainian independence. The bureaucracy was strong 
in the USSR and is equally strong here in Ukraine. The same 
applies to Russia. It is the bureaucracy, rather than the 
Muscovites or Russians, that is the adversary of Ukrainian 
independence." It is "totally unaccountable to its own people, 
robbing them with every round of inflation, with the state 
having neither the helm nor the sails and lacking its own 
ideology, unless it is screaming nationalism that is this 
ideology", he says. 
  He concludes by congratulating the audience "on the glorious 
340th anniversary of the Pereyaslav Council" that took the 
decision to unite Ukraine and Russia, and appeals: "With Russia 
for ever!"

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1710 GMT on 20 January carries the program 
"Approaching Elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine." The 
program features the platforms of the Peasant Party of Ukraine 
and the Socialist Party of Ukraine. Each party has been given a 
10-minute slot on the program during which it can present its 
views. 
  The announcer begins by introducing the Peasant Party of 
Ukraine and the Socialist Party of Ukraine whose candidates have 
been nominated to run in the upcoming election to the Supreme 
Council. The Peasant Party is represented by its chairman Serhiy 
Dovhan, and the Socialist Party by Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of 
its political council, and Volodymyr Marchenko, member of the 
political council presidium. 
  The Peasant Party, according to its chairman Dovhan, has a 
membership of more than 70,000 members among rural working 
collectives. He says that the party decided not to join any 
election alliances with other political organizations. "Our 
party's position is strictly centrist." He continues: "If our 
plans and our program are shared by other parties and movements, 
we are ready to join forces to solve the global task of working 
out a political and economic course to take Ukraine out of its 
deep and prolonged crisis." 
  This anti-crisis course, in the Peasant Party's view, must 
start with the provision for a steady development of the 
agrarian sector. "Our party has a specific program and will be 
able to take Ukraine out of the difficult economic crisis within 
the next two years. We will ensure that our people are provided 
with food at the level of 1992, and then make sure that Ukraine 
progresses to a higher grade and becomes a serious food producer 
on the world market." 
  The party's election objectives are outlined as follows: 
"First of all, to provide legislation guaranteeing accession to 
civilized market relations as opposed to the current wild 
market. Our party recognizes the right to maintain different 
forms of ownership and economic activity. Unlike some 
ultra-reformers, we do not advocate the destruction of state 
enterprises, and state and collective farms during the 
transition to market relations. They need to be reformed in a 
speedy and popular way, rather than an elite privatization, and 
transformed into associations, cooperatives, and joint-stock 
companies." 
  The Peasant Party supports private farming, however; it 
believes that forming the necessary legislative and technical 
base for its development would take many years. 
  "The Peasant Party believes that land should be owned only 
by 
those who work it and take care of it. Legislation must confirm 
the peasants' unconditional ownership of land along with the 
right to pass it on to their heirs and each peasant's right to 
sell and buy its share of land within a collective of 
land-users. Each must have the right to own a garden plot." 
  The party will use all its powers to prevent sale of land 
for 
"next to nothing" to corrupt government officials and "capital 
owners, including foreign ones." 
  The party will press for more government support and 
subsidies, for "a parity of prices between industrial and 
agricultural products, without the domination of self-invented 
credit lines." It will insist on the reduction of taxes imposed 
on agricultural enterprises, retaining only the tax on land 
property. 
  The Peasant Party believes that small and medium businesses 
should be encouraged to help convert Ukraine's industrial 
facilities to upgrade food processing, attracting also foreign 
investment for the purpose. 
  The party's main goal, Dovhan says, is the stabilization of 
Ukraine's economy which, in turn, will strengthen its 
sovereignty. 
  "In this noble cause, the Peasant Party of Ukraine appeals 
for unity, national concord and solidarity of all: democrats, 
Communists, Liberals, or Socialists -- all constructive 
associations and movements in the name of preserving and 
developing our sovereign state. 
  "I appeal to my colleagues, party activists, agricultural 
managers and specialists, please, by all means, nominate a 
representative of the countryside in every constituency. I call 
on electors to support the peasants. If we fail to do this, we 
are in store for the worst." 
  Chairman of the Socialist Party Oleksandr Moroz begins his 
election broadcast with an attack on his anti-Communist rivals: 
"What party should you vote for? Who should you give your 
preferences? Think of what I'm saying. The Peasant, Socialist, 
and Communist parties are parties of the working people. The 
others, with rare exceptions, whatever they say, are advocating 
wild capitalization. Thus, these parties are anti-popular." 
  The party has grown and strengthened its ranks "without the 
help of the West" in the three years of its existence, Moroz 
says. Although Ukraine's Government rejected the Socialist 
party's anti-crisis program proposed two years ago, some of its 
points are being used in the government's present policy, he 
says. 
  The Socialist leader appeals for "love and pride for 
homeland," jobs, and the security lost with the fall of 
socialism, in contrast to the current situation. He says: 
"Today's liberalization, privatization, and hyperinflation are 
mechanisms of robbing the people. It is a planned and conscious 
robbery by the power of the mafiosi." Some of the proposed 
privatization plans are viewed as part of that robbery. 
  "We are against turning land into an object of sale and 
purchase. Look at Russia: in Voronezh, six hectares were sold to 
the Germans, and these six hectares have already been shipped 
abroad in wagons. Is it a return to 1942?" Other socialist 
objectives include the freezing of prices and wages. 
  The present government is being wrongly described as 
Communist, Moroz says, and its policies should not be confused 
with the Communist or Socialist party ideas. "It's a lie that 
Communists are in power. Without touching the president's 
closest circles, I will name a few from the top power echelon, 
you make your own conclusions: Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, Lanovyy, 
Zhulynskyy, Morozov, Ryabchenko, Chernyak, Yemets, Kostenko, 
Talanchuk, (?Sheshchyn), Markulov -- they are the ones who are 
deciding our foreign and home policy." 
  "We are accused of being in opposition to reforms," adds 
Volodymyr Marchenko in conclusion. "It's a lie. We are against 
the robbery described as reform. We are in favor of reforms 
that benefit honest people, not the ones executed at their 
expense. We are for the kind of reforms which will bring power 
and property to the people."

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Gruzdilovich: "Bill Clinton: I Had Not </F>
Expected Such a Hearty Welcome"] 
  [Text]The U.S. President was sincerely pleased. 
Minsk residents, having touched him, were touched too. 
  I have managed to ask U.S. President Clinton about his 
impressions on his visit to Minsk in the huddle on the Pobyeda 
square, where, to the Minsk residents' delight, he boldly got 
into contact with them, thus putting his "security" [precedent 
word in transliterated English] men into a tight mess. Yet his 
bodyguards have come out of this mess with credit. However, as 
the President was approaching his limousine, I managed to elbow 
my way through the crowd for a mini-interview. To the title 
phrase of this report, Bill Clinton, while broadly smiling and 
lifting his hands, added that he was sincerely pleased. One may 
suppose, he was pleased not only with his visit results but also 
with the Minsk residents' delight at seeing him. 
  Returning to that touching moment when the U.S. President 
was 
shaking hundreds of outstretched hands with particular attention 
to the children, it should be said that this mutually friendly 
disposition of Minsk residents and the President seemed to break 
some invisible wall of grave officialdom, with which this visit 
was surrounded; further, everything progressed in a more humane 
fashion. I have in mind his meeting at the Academy of Science, 
where Bill Clinton delivered a brilliant speech more in an 
absorbed interlocutor's manner than in a lecturer's tone. I 
mean also his visit to the Kuropaty burial ground where he was 
all concentrated, but his accentuated concentration seemed to be 
for his deep feeling, not for show. Well, it is remarkable when 
an extremely official event on the political Olympus takes on 
more human traits. This gives hope that documents are signed 
not for documents' sake, and that the essence of those documents 
are the people and people's predicaments. We have seen that the 
U.S. President is capable of convincing not only American people 
but also our citizens who by now are lost in heavy doubts as to 
whether power is for the people or, per chance, against the 
people. 
  I would like to focus on this aspect of Clinton's visit to 
Minsk before touching upon the official results. 
Unquestionably, it was a visit of support. Not only for 
moderate reformers in the Supreme Soviet, whose efforts to 
promulgate a new constitution and to launch new elections this 
year were evidently supported and stimulated by Clinton. Not 
only for the highest government officials who at last dared to 
speak about our good interest in the common cause of nuclear 
disarmament and who heard the U.S. President's positive 
statements that were very close to guarantees. Not only for 
industrialists, scientists, and entrepreneurs, for whom the 
adopted documents -- agreements on the protection of 
investments, on science and technology, on the creation of a 
bilateral committee for developing business, on the 
establishment of an American business center and regional 
funding -- are of the greatest interest. Not only for 
oppositionists who were able to impart their opinions on the 
situation in the Republic to the U.S. President and received 
moral support in his assertion that American assistance will be 
rendered depending on the success of democratic processes. I 
repeat -- not only for them. First of all, it was a visit of 
support for everyone of us, for ordinary citizens who suffer all 
the burden of the transition from one system to another. We are 
confused, we are even shocked; only a few of us know how to get 
out of this jam. President Clinton does not assume the role of 
some messiah or commander, but he believes in our strength and 
our ability to overcome difficulties which he calls "a pay for 
hope." He believes that we will adopt a worthy constitution, 
establish an economic basis for a worthy life and the economic 
protection of the people, as well as elect a new legislative 
body and create a system which will allow everyone to 
participate in adopting the most important resolutions in our 
Republic. He extends best wishes to this country which suffered 
from ideological conflicts, war, and Chernobyl; he believes in 
its citizens and wants to help them. Such were some of 
Clinton's statements voiced in his speech at the Academy of 
Sciences. It should be noted that his hope for holding new 
elections in Belarus was rewarded by a special burst of applause. 
  What else can be included in a nonprotocol summary of this 
visit? One extremely personal, but, it seems, significant 
observation. The majority of the audience at the Academy of 
Sciences -- mainly young scientists, young politicians and 
journalists, and the cultural elite -- listened to the U.S. 
President "live," whereas state officials clutched earphones 
with a simultaneous translation. One should only agree with 
Bill Clinton that this new highly educated and talented 
generation is our greatest hope.

<F P=106> [Speech by Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy at the Supreme </F>
Soviet in Minsk on 18 January] 
  [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies! 
  We were presented by history with this unique opportunity to 
ensure a worthy place for our young independent state on the 
European continent at a time when the world has rid itself of 
the hostile standoff of military blocs and confrontation between 
West and East. 
  It would be naive to overlook the fact that nowadays, the 
world is developing according to laws based on a new reality. 
Ever increasing economic, technological, informational, and 
cultural relations among states have already prompted us to 
redefine the notion of neutrality. Policies of all neutral 
European states are definitely shifting toward active 
participation in all-European processes sponsored by the United 
Nations and CSCE, as well as activation of links with the EC. 
The tendency toward the political unification of West Europe is 
all the more conspicuous. 
  The situation east of Belarus is unfolding no less 
dynamically. Contrary to predictions, the CIS has not 
disintegrated but is developing, despite serious difficulties. 
  The last year made a substantial impact on CIS member 
states, 
bringing their positions closer and deepening their all-around 
cooperation. Many republics redefined their position in favor 
of expanding integration within the CIS, which was evidenced by 
the meeting in Ashgabat on 23-24 December 1993. This meeting 
was attended by 11 of the 12 CIS defense ministers -- absent was 
the Moldovan minister. It was unanimously agreed that the CIS 
Allied Armed Forces General Command be replaced with the Staff 
for Coordination of Military Cooperation. All the states -- 
including Ukraine, whose position has until recently been 
reduced to observer status -- declared their intent to 
participate in its work. All defense ministers concurred in the 
opinion that it is easier to resolve problems connected with the 
building of military forces in cooperation and conjunction with 
one another. The newly created staff is designed to coordinate 
this process. I think everyone understands that the elimination 
of the CIS General Command put the idea of forming an Allied 
Armed Forces out of the question. From now on, issues connected 
with operational use of CIS national forces lie exclusively with 
the competence of their own governments. 
  All speculations about the possibility of dispatching troops 
to "hot spots" proved unfounded. Not one single serviceman will 
ever be sent outside our country without the permission of the 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet. 
  We intend to participate actively in the activities of the 
Staff for Coordination of Military Cooperation. It will be 
staffed based on the coalition and equal-footing principle. Our 
representatives there will seek closer cooperation with other 
CIS countries in the military sphere, which is of vital 
importance to our Armed Forces at this time. Bilateral contacts 
do not offer as many opportunities for cooperation as we would 
like. 
  Although we have concluded bilateral agreements with the 
Russian Federation and Ukraine, they do not work stably without 
a system of coordination. Everything comes down to financial 
relations and the system of licenses and duties. In our 
opinion, every concluded agreement must be part of a system of 
agreements among states, and the Treaty on Collective Security 
is absolutely essential to this system. 
  The issue of Belarusian entry into the collective security 
treaty has been repeatedly debated at different levels. We are 
familiar with the opinions of our partners about conditions that 
Belarus put forward while joining the treaty. All agree that 
you cannot participate in it partially. As for the present 
conditions, they simply specify our understanding of Articles 4 
and 6 without altering their meaning. I would like you to 
examine them once again. 
  Out of 11 articles of the treaty, none encroaches on our 
Republic's sovereignty and its intention to achieve neutrality. 
To do this, one should ensure a reliable security for society 
and the state, lay the foundation for peaceful relations with 
neighbors, and receive security and support guarantees from 
friendly states in case of outside aggression. 
  The idea of neutrality can be actually implemented after 
three problems are solved: 
  In economy -- development of strong basic industries capable 
of ensuring the stable and independent operation of the economy; 
  In politics -- recognition of our neutrality by other states 
and their guarantee to respect its existence; 
  And finally, the third problem is a well-trained Armed 
Forces 
to protect sovereignty -- if need be, with arms -- and a 
comprehensive system of their support. As you can see, these 
problems have not been solved yet. 
  All provisions of the treaty can serve as and are designed 
to be a security guarantee for Belarus. For example, the 
document's preamble is based on the sovereignty of independent 
states. Article 2 provides for the mechanism of joint 
consultations in the event of a threat, which also complies with 
the proclaimed principles. There are no corrections in the 
remaining articles, except for Articles 4 and 6. 
  In Article 4, we propose to specify the passage "Providing 
necessary assistance, including military"; while in Article 6, 
we emphasize that the decision to use the Belarusian Armed 
Forces lies exclusively with the competence of the Supreme 
Soviet, and can only be executed in accordance with Belarusian 
law. These reservations do not run counter to the goals and 
objectives of the treaty, and I think will raise no doubts on 
the part of its participants, the number of which will now rise 
to nine. 
  Close military cooperation with CIS countries will reduce 
our 
losses while reforming our Armed Forces, secure the civilized 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarusian territory, help 
maintain high combat readiness of the Army that would be 
equipped with modern arms, and create favorable internal and 
external conditions for establishing the state. 
  This will also ensure a positive solution of the issue of 
Belarus' share of nuclear fuel produced from warhead uranium 
processing after the removal of nuclear weapons from Belarusian 
territory. 
  Unfortunately, the need of the Armed Forces for 
material-technical supplies (production, repairs, armaments and 
equipment regulations, shipments of ZIP, AKB, [expansions 
unknown] etc.) and personnel training can only be met through 
military cooperation with other CIS countries. The Belarusian 
Republic has every right to benefit from the scientific and 
technical potential of the Soviet Armed Forces. 
  Belarusian scientific and military-complex enterprises will 
not receive any orders from the CIS countries before we take a 
common interest in guaranteeing our own security. 
  Today, the potential of Air Force equipment is practically 
exhausted; due to the lack of repair funds, design bureaus, 
etc., other equipment is on the verge of collapse, servicing 
equipment of air defense, rocket, and air forces. [sentence as 
published] 
  A question may arise here: Could these three problems 
possibly be solved by signing the collective security treaty? 
Of course, we will not get anything for free. However, as an 
equal partner, we will enjoy privileges and benefits in the 
system of joint production, equipment repair and servicing, and 
exchanges of technology and military information. Common use of 
airspace, communication routes, airfields, and testing grounds 
promises substantial economic advantages. 
  Let me also remind you that we need military cooperation 
with 
other CIS countries if only to maintain the combat readiness of 
the Belarusian Armed Forces at a high level. For us, joining 
the collective security treaty is economically justified. For 
example, unification of air defense forces, anti-rocket defense 
forces, intelligence, and other components would greatly enhance 
national security. We see no alternative here. 
  Following the example of some European states, Belarus can 
join the collective security system reserving the right to 
participate in peacekeeping operations only in regions 
representing a threat to the security of our state. 
  Germany, one of NATO's most active members, participates in 
the collective security system based on such principles. 
  Besides, without our own military industry and a developed 
system of arms purchases, and without having solved all problems 
concerning international treaties on conventional arms reduction 
in Europe, we are forced to maintain the closest possible 
contacts with all CIS states. 
  All these arguments -- and they can be much more expanded -- 
underline the need for explicit ratification of the Treaty on 
Collective Security that took Belarus so much effort to sign. 
  Concluding, let me stress again that given the developing 
situation and the present economic situation, one should not see 
the status of neutrality as a goal in itself. I am confident 
that all of our neighbors, which want to see our state as a 
thriving and reliable partner, will understand this. It is not 
admissible to remain neutral to any integration processes that 
are rapidly gathering speed. Today, instead of its classical 
form, neutrality can assume a differentiating and selective 
nature. 
  The true condition of the Armed Forces and a search for 
anti- 
crisis solutions force me to call upon you to ratify the Treaty 
on Collective Security.

  [Text] In an interview granted to Tiraspol television in 
the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party and deputy of the 
State Duma, has made a delirious statement again, throwing 
menacing statements and invectives at an independent and 
sovereign state -- the Republic of Moldova. 
  Here is an excerpt from that interview, which caused 
consternation in Chisinau and not just there: 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording, in Russian with superimposed 
Romanian translation] Send us your request immediately to join 
the ruble zone and that is it! You will have Russian currency, 
all your payments will be made in rubles, and you will not have 
any more problems. That is the sole solution. 
  You are a part of Russia, even if, for the time being, 
Moldova does not want to become a part of Russia. I promise I 
will do it! We will incorporate you within Russia on all planes, 
including the diplomatic, military, financial, and economic 
aspects. 
  I wish you courage and manliness. I understand your 
situation. You are encircled by Moldova and Ukraine. Yours is 
the most difficult situation in the whole of Russia. Look, the 
Russians in Lithuania have Leningrad to support them. However, 
there is no one standing beside you. You represent the most 
heroic part of Russia! I will do everything I can. I will make 
all necessary efforts for you to return to Russia, and we will 
compensate all your losses. Of course, we cannot compensate 
your losses in human lives, but we will compensate them by 
severely punishing all those who are guilty for the crimes 
perpetrated on the soil of the Dniester Republic. We will not 
lie to you and we will not betray you! Never, ever! The 
Dniester Republic shall be a part of Russia! [end recording] 
  In connection with the aforementioned allegations, which 
justify the requests of Zhirinovskiy's many compatriots to begin 
penal investigations against him or send him to a mental 
hospital, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Republic of 
Moldova has issued the following press communique: 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Moldova today sent a note to 
the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Chisinau in connection 
with the interview granted by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to Tiraspol 
television, which was broadcast on 18 January 1994, in which the 
deputy to the Russian Duma formulated territorial claims against 
the Republic of Moldova, saying, among other things, that the 
Dniester Republic should be included in Russia and that the 
[14th] Army will stay there. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry considers such statements made 
by a representative of Russia's law-making body as irresponsible 
and consequently as an attempt made against the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. Such 
statements prejudice Moldovan-Russian relations, create tension 
among the public opinion, and might negatively influence the 
talks on the political settlement of the conflict in the eastern 
rayons [of Moldova] and the withdrawal of the 14th Army from 
Moldova. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Moldova resolutely protests 
and requests that adequate steps be taken to express the clear 
distancing of the competent bodies of the Russian Federation 
from the stance and statements made by Zhirinovskiy, concludes 
the press communique released by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of 
the Republic of Moldova.

strained between the leadership of the self-styled Dniester 
Republic and the commander of the 14th [Russian] Army, General 
Aleksandr Lebed. 
  Recently new elements have been added to the conflict, which 
actually dates back to earlier times: On Friday [14 January], 
during a program on the local cable television Asket, General 
Lebed stated that the leaflets that had been distributed on the 
previous night announcing that a coup was being prepared had 
been printed at the suggestion of Vladimir Shevtsov, the 
security minister of the separatist government. Lebed also 
accused Shevtsov of cabling a communique to Moscow warning about 
the alleged coup, which was to have taken place on 15 January. 
  In addition, on the same day on which Lebed replied to those 
allegations [on Asket television], the Dniester authorities 
issued a press communique and organized a news conference on the 
same issue. 
  Further events took place on Tuesday, 18 January, when the 
Moscow daily IZVESTIYA published a statement by Lebed, who, 
among other things, asserted: "Currently they are openly 
looting in the Dniester Republic, and that is why no progress is 
being achieved in the peace talks [with Moldova]" and that the 
solution, in his opinion, consists of "the banishment of all 
those loathsome figures (the current Dniester leaders -- 
editor's note), the organization of new elections, and the 
ascent to power of credible personalities..." That is why the 
general called upon the population living on the left bank of 
the Dniester to disobey the authorities. 
  Recently the commander of the 14th Army held a meeting with 
school headmasters and the chairmen of the trade unions in the 
educational sector. Speaking in front of the plenum of that 
meeting, Lebed acknowledged the children's right to study in 
their mother tongue from textbooks printed in the Latin 
alphabet. That upset Professor Vasiliy Yakovlev, the leader of 
a civic group, so much that he called Lebed "a spy for the 
Republic of Moldova" and a "coauthor of the Romanization of 
education in the Dniester republic." 
  Also on Tuesday [18 January] the 14th Army Command issued a 
declaration warning the Tiraspol authorities that "decisive 
retaliatory measures will be taken, including the use of arms, 
if slander and attacks are issued against the personnel and the 
military assets of the Army of the Russian Federation." 
  It seems that Moscow, in the person of General Lebed, is fed 
up with the unaccomplished vanity of the self-styled republic's 
leaders, and it also intends to react firmly. Obviously, all 
such reaction will be in pursuit of Moscow's goals. 
  Anyway, a dual power structure has been instated in 
Tiraspol, 
and both parties possess sufficiently large and well equipped 
military and paramilitary forces.

with a stamp depicting Aleksandr Suvorov glued on them. Locals 
have christened them suvorovki. Pensioners were first to get 
the new money. The minimum pension is equal to 60,000 stamped

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Vinogradov: "Almaty Demands Billion </F>
Dollars for Its Uranium"] 
  [Text] Kazakhstan intends to get the full amount [poluchit 
spolna] for the uranium contained in the warheads of the 104 
SS-18 missiles located on its territory. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev said this in Kiev, where he is on an 
official visit. The Kazakh president pointed out that he is 
ready to sign a new agreement with Russia either on a bilateral 
basis or on a quadrilateral basis involving Ukraine and Belarus. 
In the next few days he will be going to Washington to discuss 
these problems with Bill Clinton. 
  Russia believed that the matter of compensation for the 
nuclear material in the strategic missiles due for removal from 
Kazakhstan was in principle closed. There are agreements on 
this point. Almaty, like Kiev and Minsk, should receive its 
share after deduction of expenditure on the reprocessing of 
highly enriched uranium and its transportation and storage at 
Russian plants. 
  However, all the indications are that the method of 
calculation adopted earlier does not suit the Kazakh side. It 
intends to follow the example of Ukraine, which succeeded a week 
ago in obtaining $1 billion on signing the trilateral agreement 
with Russia and the United States in Moscow. This money is 
being given to Ukraine out of the sum appropriated by the U.S. 
Congress for the nuclear disarmament of the CIS countries under 
the START I treaty. It has become known that Almaty is hoping 
for similar compensation. 
  In other words, Kazakhstan, like Ukraine, has decided not to 
wait for funds to come into its account from the sale of uranium 
by its Russian partners, whom it is not inclined to trust very 
much. It is obviously safer to get insurance now, in the form of 
a guaranteed billion out of the U.S. quota. 
  Experts believe that in that event Russia will have to take 
on additional expenditure for the safe dismantling of nuclear 
warheads in the possession of its CIS neighbors. It cannot be 
rule out that Belarus will demand its share in the same way, 
although some of the uranium has already been shipped out of its 
territory to Russia for reprocessing. When it hosted Bill 
Clinton recently, Minsk received $100 million from this same 
package. But now, REUTER reports, Belarus is laying claim to a 
further $500 million.

  [Text] Bishkek January 25 TASS -- Kyrgyzstan feels no 
Russian imperial ambitions and will work to ensure that ethnic 
Russians do not emigrate from the Central Asian republic, 
according to President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev. 
  Kyrgyzstan "sees no imperial ambitions in Russian actions 
and 
does not feel any pressure from Moscow", he told a press 
conference after meeting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
on Tuesday and added that he intends to use every effort to 
strengthen the provisions fixed in the Russian-Kyrgyz friendship 
treaty. 
  Akayev also stressed that he would do everything possible so 
that nealy a million of Russian ethnics living in Kyrgyzstan "do 
not feel any inconveniences" and that the Central Asian republic 
"remains good motherland for all citizens of the country, 
including Russians". 
  Kozyrev, in his turn, said the Russian leadership supports 
democratic Kyrgyzstan and will render any necessary assistance 
to President Akayev. 
  The minister added that the protection of the rights of 
Russians in CIS countries has nothing in common with imperial 
ambitions. Human rights protection has nothing in common with 
"imperial policy as Russia respected and respects sovereign 
rights of its equal partners", Kozyrev said. 
  He handed over to Akayev a message from Boris Yeltsin in 
which the Russian president pledged support to market reforms 
and democratic transformations of Kyrgyz authorities. 
  Akayev and Kozyrev signed a consular convention and a 
protocol on the exchange of ratification credentials to the 
treaty "on legal assistance and legal relations in civil, family 
and criminal cases". 
  Kozyrev, who is accompanied by Deputy Defence Minister Boris 
Gromov, left for the city of Blagoveshchensk on the border with 
China from where he will proceed for a visit to the neighbouring 
country.

  [Text] Russia supports Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev's 
state program for improving the position of ethnic Russians in 
his republic, says Yeltsin's message to Akayev, handed to the 
Kyrgyz president by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  This document confirms Moscow's readiness to continue 
rendering every possible economic assistance and support to 
fraternal Kyrgyzstan. 
  During his talks with Akayev, Kozyrev described Kyrgyzstan 
as 
one of Russia's closest allies. "I've always said that we are 
not alien to each other, although many have accused me of 
imperialism for such words," said the Russian minister. "What 
can be more normal than stating that we are vitally interested 
in each other," he said. 
  President Akayev said that the new program was aimed at 
checking the outflow of ethnic Russians from Kyrgyzstan. He 
believes that the Russian foreign minister's current visit will 
help support the industrial enterprises mostly employing ethnic 
Russians. 
  Akayev also said that the Kyrgyz defense enterprises 
employing ethnic Russians and their Russian partners should have 
equal access to raw materials and equipment. "This is not going 
to be a one-way street," he said. "If large packages of Kyrgyz 
enterprises' shares go to Russia, these enterprises will carry 
on, providing thousands of people with jobs," he added. He also 
thinks that this would enhance ethnic Russians' confidence. 
  As an example of the efforts to raise the ethnic Russians' 
status he referred to the establishment of a Kyrgyz-Slavic 
university in Bishkek which is training 200 students. To quote 
the Kyrgyz president, this university "is expected to calm the 
Slavic ethnic groups living in Kyrgyzstan, because their 
children will be able to receive an education in their native 
language." 
  The program also contains measures to ensure that the 
teaching of the Russian language, the language of inter-state 
communication in the CIS, is not reduced. "The Kyrgyz people 
cannot neglect the great source of Russian culture," said Akayev. 
  He is convinced that only jointly with Russia can Kyrgyzstan 
solve the problems facing ethnic Russians. "We can solve 
psychological problems and create an atmosphere of good will," 
he said. However, on its own Kyrgyzstan will fail to solve the 
economic aspects of this problem, he concluded.

  [Text] Russia's foreign policy has not undergone any 
changes, Russian Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Kyrgyz President 
Askar Akayev on Tuesday. 
  Kozyrev said that neither the patriots, nor the fascists 
influence Russian foreign policy in any way. However, he 
apologized for the "fascist statements made in Moscow recently." 
The protection of ethnic Russians in the former Soviet 
republics has nothing to do with imperialism, he continued. He 
emphasized, though, that "we cannot remain indifferent to 
violations of ethnic Russians' rights, particularly in Latvia, 
from where they are being forced out." 
  Akayev said that he did not see any imperial ambitions in 
Russia's foreign policy. "Without a strong and great Russia, 
stability in Eurasia is unthinkable," he said. Speaking about 
the problem of dual citizenship, he noted that it should be 
tackled on a bilateral basis. 
  Kozyrev announced that Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin was to arrive in Bishkek shortly for comprehensive 
talks on economic cooperation.

self-defense detachment and a group of about 15 Afghan mojahedin 
who penetrated from the territory of adjacent Afghanistan, took 
place on 23 January in the region of the Tajik border village of 
Yamkun. After losing two men killed and several wounded the 
mojahedin retreated. During the battle the local population 
liberated two fellow villagers seized by the Afghans. 
  The authorities of Gorno-Badakhshan and representatives of 
the headquarters of the command of the Russian border troops in 
Tajikistan protested to the Afghan side and demanded that the 
organizers of this provocation are brought to justice. 
  The press center of the Russian border troops' command in 
Tajikistan reports that the situation in other sections along 
the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border remains complicated, but under 
control. According to the same source, no armed incidents in 
the Moskovskiy, Pyandzhskiy and other sections of the border 
have been registered in the last two days.

<F P=106> [From the "Week in Review" program, with program presenter </F>
Muborez Nekvarz and Farhod Mumin, political commentator of the 
Voice of Free Tajikistan] 
  [Excerpt] [Nekvarz] Let us review the events of last week. 
I think the hot issue of the week was the internal clashes in 
Afghanistan. 
  [Mumim] That is right. However, analysis of the Afghan 
internal disagreements is the job of the Afghan brothers 
themselves, but here I would like to point out one issue which 
is causing concern to us Tajiks and to the world community. 
This issue is the bombing of Tajik refugee camps in Afghanistan 
by unknown aircraft. 
  Several points need to be clarified here. First, those who 
have resorted to this act, by taking advantage of internal 
conflict in Afghanistan, are trying to fulfill their ugly 
political aims. 
  [Nekvarz] Who do you have in mind and to whom do these 
aircraft belong? 
  [Mumim] In my opinion the bombing of the Tajik refugee camps 
was planned outside the territory of Afghanistan. In no way 
could this action have been organized by the opposing formations 
or ethnic groups of Afghanistan. Because from the first days 
the charitable Afghan brothers have welcomed Tajik refugees as 
their true brothers and sisters and have provided all-round 
assistance to them. 
  Although the Afghan opposing sides have disagreements among 
themselves, they all have a good opinion of the Tajik refugees 
and we hope, God willing, that this will continue. 
  In my view, these aircraft either belonged to Uzbekistan or 
to Russia and they carried out these attacks by order of the 
communist regime of Rakhmanov -- a regime which is used to 
attacking its own people with foreign forces. 
  [Nekvarz] I would like to point out that this incident was 
reported by the world's influential media such as REUTER, the 
BBC, Radio Liberty, and others. 
  [Mumim] That is absolutely correct. Analysis of events shows 
that the communist government of Tajikistan had a hand in these 
conspiracies. The bombing raids against the refugee camps were 
carried out two weeks ago following the appeal by Imamali 
Rakhmanov to his so-called compatriots abroad. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The situation remains tense on the Tajik-Afghan 
border, INTERFAX reports. Last night, Russian border guards 
foiled an attempt by an armed group to cross over from 
Tajikistan to Afghanistan, or rather from Afghanistan to 
Tajikistan -- I beg your pardon -- in the area of section five 
of border post no. 12 of the Pyandzh border detachment. 
  Yesterday, in the area of the same border post, Russian 
border guards discovered a group of Tajik opposition fighters 
who intended to violate the border. In an exchange of fire that 
followed, three armed violators were killed, and the others 
retreated. 
  Also yesterday, two rockets were fired at border post no. 12 
from the territory of Afghanistan. Fortunately, there were no 
casualties among the border guards.

  [Text] The nationalist factions "Movement for Latvia's 
National Independence" and "Fatherland and Freedom" of the 
Latvian Saeima (parliament) today jointly prepared a draft law 
on citizenship to be submitted for referendum. 
  According to the draft law, Latvian citizenship could be 
granted only to ethnic Latvians who have returned to the 
republic; those legally residing in Latvia before 1940 but 
lacking citizenship; spouses of Latvian citizens living on the 
Latvian territory over 10 years and citizens of Lithuania and 
Estonia permanently residing in the republic. 
  In addition, the factions proposed setting the annual quotas 
for granting citizenship at 0.1% of the Latvian population. At 
the moment, it is about 1900 persons a year. 
  The authors of the draft law propose the beginning of the 
naturalization be linked with the ultimate withdrawal of Russian 
troops. 
  At a press conference, they pointed out that their proposals 
were an alternative to the document prepared by the ruling 
coalition, encompassing the factions "Latvian Way" and 
"Peasants' Union," which was passed in the first reading last 
December. 
  This draft law stipulates that the Latvian citizenship could 
be granted to former citizens of the Soviet Union permanently 
residing in Latvia for over 10 years and having command of the 
Latvian language. The annual naturalization quota will be set 
by the republican government.

  [Text] Riga, January 24 (LETA) -- Last Friday [21 January] 
the chairman of the Latvian parliament, Anatolijs Gorbunovs, met 
the U.S. Republican congressman, James Sensenbrenner, and the 
U.S. ambassador to Latvia, Ints Silins. 
  During the talks Sensenbrenner reaffirmed the continued 
support of the U.S. Congress and Administration to the Latvian 
sovereignty. The guest underlined that the U.S. Congress had no 
differences concerning the fast withdrawal of the Russian troops 
from Latvia. He reminded that aid to Russia was closely linked 
to security issues. If Russia threatens any neighbouring 
country, the congress would immediately cancel the aid 
programme, he said. 
  Gorbunovs thanked the United States for support and added 
that Latvia was concerned about the recent remarks by the 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. He voiced the 
necessity of international control over the removal of the 
Russian troops from Latvia, especially concerning the future of 
the radar base in Skrunda, as Russia rejected the term of three 
years proposed by the Latvian Government. The Latvian 
parliament could consider other suggestions only if concrete 
international guarantees were provided for. 
  The U.S. ambassador to Latvia assured that the United States 
would not regard the Russian presence at the Skrunda base for a 
definite period of time as a proof that Latvia was within the 
Russian sphere of interests. He said that a U.S. delegation 
would arrive in Latvia at the weekend to discuss further 
bilateral military cooperation. 
  Sensenbrenner also said that he was willing to meet a 
delegation of Latvian legislators that could visit the United 
States at the end of February to study the lawmaking practices 
at the U.S. Congress.

  [Text] Riga, January 24 (LETA) -- Experts from the fund 
"For Internal Security of Latvia" worked out a conception of 
stabilization and strengthening of internal security of Latvia. 
Today, the main task for the Republic is actual security of 
economic and political independence of Latvia, said Ivars 
Kezbers, the fund's adviser on external relations. According to 
the conception, concrete events will be executed in order that 
juridical institutions daily and actually take care of security 
of Latvia's population and guarantee people human rights and 
freedoms. According to the conception, all structures fighting 
against crimes should be united in the institution of state 
police. 
  In correspondence to the conception, only one department of 
counterintelligence and one department of intelligence service 
are necessary in Latvia. These two services should not be split 
into various other state institutions, as it is at present. In 
addition, one more special service is necessary in the Latvian 
Ministry of Defense. This service will deal with military 
counterintelligence.

<F P=106> [Irina Litvinova report: "Only Latvian `Citizens' Have </F>

  [Text] Riga -- The Latvian Seimas has adopted a "law on 
operational activity," whole sections of which provide broad 
scope for the special services. Correspondence can be monitored 
and secretly copied, conversations can be bugged, and people can 
be followed. 
  Operational activity relies on "cooperation with the 
population." Those who used to be called "informers" are now 
known as "secret assistants." Here too there was no getting 
away from the division between the rights of Latvian "citizens" 
and "noncitizens" (who comprise one-third of the population). 
Only "citizens" can collect information on other persons, 
facts, and cases -- in other words, become "secret assistants."

  [Text] Riga, Jan 24, BNS -- The Foreign Assistance 
Coordination Commission looked through proposals to change the 
procedure of distributing G-24 credits in Latvia, Finance 
Ministry's spokesman Valdis Freidenfelds told BNS. 
  In the commission's opinion, contracts on the delivery of 
equipment, raw materials or fuel should be paid through 
banks-distributors of the credit. 
  Recipients should directly receive no more than 15 percent 
of 
the total worth of a credit, the commission said. The 
regulation is designed to prevent financial machinations with 
credit money. 
  The group also reviewed the Indication Program, which is 
implemented in the framework of the PHARE [Poland and Hungary 
for Restructuring the Economy] program. In 1994, the program's 
funding will be used to finance economic, administrative and 
agricultural reforms. 
  The 1994 PHARE action mainstreams will be adopted in March 
in 
Brussels. Latvia could receive an estimated 21 million ECU's, 
specialists say. 
  The commission is headed by Finance Minister Uldis Osis, its 
members are Economics Minister Ojars Kehris, Economics 
Ministry's State Secretary Aina Bataraga and Bank of Latvia's 
Vice President Ilmars Rimasevics. It was set up in the end of 
1993 in compliance with a government resolution.

  [Text] Baku (January 24) TURAN--As a result of the latest 
fitings on the territory of Kelbadzhar region of the Republic, 
the units of Azeri army managed to liberate 12 settlements. 
According to press-centre of Defense Ministry (DM) of 
Azerbaijan, only for the last week all the villages situated in 
the northern part of Kelbadzhar region were liberated. 
Simultaneously, Azeri soldiers have taken all strategically 
important top-hills which ensure the control over motor highway 
Kelbadzhar-Agdere (Mardakert). Moreover, a section of the 
high-way Kelbajar-Lachin is controlled by Azeri units as well. 
  For the last week in this section of the front 300 Armenian 
soldiers and officers have been killed and wounded, 9 tanks, 2 
BMP, 5 artillery systems of the enemy have been destroyed. As 
trophies Azeri soldiers have taken 4 tanks, 2 BMP and a great 
many of guns, mortars, ammunition depots. 
  5 Armenian ensigns and officers have been taken in prison at 
the same section of the front. The aressted said that they were 
the soldiers of the 127th Russian Motor-Infantry Division 
located in the city of Gyumri on the territory of Armenian 
Republic. According to their words, the reserves of ammunitions 
in Khankendi are very few and the fighting sprit of the soldiers 
is low. Within this period, Armenians tried to tranport only 20 
parcels of ammunitions and 1 barrel of fuel from Yerevan to 
Karabakh. The arrested said that in Yerevan people are caught 
at the streets, taken from home at night and sent to the Army. 
Very often Armenian soldiers are forced to fight under the 
threat of thier relatives' murder, the arrested said. 
  These data show that not "the forces of Karabakh's self- 
defense" but regular units of Armenian army including soldiers 
of Russian units located on the territory of Armenian Republic 
fight against Azerbaijan.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry has dismissed the 
reports that an Azerbaijani combat jet was shot down near 
Khankendi (Stepanakert) on January 23. The Azerbaijani mission 
in Moscow told Interfax today that the information was "not true 
to life." The mission also dismissed the reports about a 
large-scale offensive launched by Armenian forces. 
  At the same time, the press service of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
army confirmed to Interfax that the jet was shot down saying 
that its leftovers had been found. A special group left for the 
place where the jet fell into the ground to look for the pilot 
or his body and verify the type of aircraft. According to 
preliminary information, it was an assault plane Sukhoi-25. 
  The press service said that two Azerbaijani jets trespassed 
the air border of Nagorno-Karabakh again at 13:30 today. 
According to preliminary information, one of the jets dropped 
several bombs near Stepanakert. The effects of the bombing are 
being verified. 
  According to sources in Stepanakert, fighting continued on a 
number of sections of the front line today. Nagorno-Karabakh 
forces repelled Azerbaijani attacks between the district centers 
of Askeran and Agdam and in the north of the Martuni district of 
Azerbaijan. Having lost 1 tank and up to 15 troops, Azerbaijani 
units had to retreat to their positions. Several 
Nagorno-Karabakh servicemen were wounded, according to the press 
service.

  A six-year war over mainly Christian Nagorno-Karabakh, which 
is seeking to break from Moslem Azerbaijan, has displaced 
hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis according to humanitarian 
[words indistinct] million. 
  Many of those who have sought refuge in hospitals or holiday 
complexes here in Sumgait, 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the 
capital, spend their days in frustrating idleness. 
  Uprooted, having no chance of finding work, their 
indignation 
deepens, particularly when they recall the day that Armenian 
troops entered their villages. 
  "This war will only end when the Armenians get out of 
Nagorno- Karabakh," insists 28-year-old Ruslamov Rovjen, who 
said he fled his village of Lachin when it came under Armenian 
control on May 17, 1992. 
  Lachin is part of a strategic Azerbaijani corridor linking 
Nagorno-Karabakh to the republic of Armenia. 
  After their capture of the region in western Azerbaijan, 
Armenian forces expanded their operations to areas south and 
southwest of the enclave, leaving them in control of more than 
20 percent of Azerbaijani territory. 
  "We can never again live with the Armenians," asserted 
Rovjen, a musician, who said he had been forced to leave 
everything behind -- including his favorite instrument, the 
accordion. 
  Other refugees say Armenian troops set fire to their homes. 
Some accuse Russian units from 7th Army and the 366th Special 
Branch of backing Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  They say they cannot understand how Azerbaijan can be seen 
abroad as the aggressor in a conflict that has killed nearly 
20,000 people in six years. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Azerbaijan welcomes Russia's mediation in its 
conflict with Armenia and is ready for constructive peace 
efforts, said a senior member of the Azerbaijani president's 
staff. 
  Rakhman Mustafazade, in an interview with Interfax, accused 
Armenia of causing delays in the peace process within the 
framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. 
  He said Azerbaijan's position fully conformed to the idea of 
the presidents of Russia and the United States as stated in 
their Moscow declaration, namely that the conflict must be 
resolved within the CIS framework and on the basis of 
international law principles, such as respect for the 
independence and existing borders of the new states on the 
territory of the former Soviet Union, including Azerbaijan and 
Armenia. 
  As Azerbaijan's principal conditions for the settlement of 
the conflict, Mustafazade named the withdrawal of Armenian 
troops from the territories they were occupying and security 
guarantees for the Armenian and Azeri population of 
Nagorno-Karabakh; abrogation by Armenia of all its legislative 
acts declaring Nagorno-Karabakh part of Armenia; and an end to 
Armenia's "policy of destroying Azeri historical and cultural 
monuments" in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Elchin Guseinbeili 
described peace plans recently proposed by some foreign 
political scientists as "not serious." He said the plan for 
"security zones" and "humanitarian corridors" for 
Nagorno-Karabakh would lead to the annexation of the "occupied 
territories" both within Nagorno-Karabakh and outside it. 
  At the same time, he said humanitarian corridors could be 
used to enable Azeri refugees from Armenia's southeastern 
regions to return home.

  [Text] The Azeri parliament is still to give its assessment 
of the January 1990 tragedy in Baku. Last Friday the opposition 
deputies blocked again the parliament's decision on the issue. 
Opposition deputies believe that only a new, democratically 
elected parliament is able to evaluate the events of three years 
ago when over 100 Baku residents died. 
  The leader of the National Independence Party Etibar Mamedov 
and representatives of the People's Front of Azerbaijan believe 
that the present parliament formed under ex-president Ayaz 
Mutalibov demonstrated more than once its unprincipled approach 
and took decisions to please each leadership. The Front's 
faction demands the disbandment of parliament and the holding of 
new elections. 
  The opposition disagrees with the point of view of President 
Geydar Aliyev and other leaders who are convinced that the 
former First Secretary of the Azeri Communist Party Central 
Committee Abdurakhman Vezirov, the then Chairman of the 
republic's Council of Ministers A. Mutalibov and the then KGB 
Chairman Vagif Guseynov are to bear responsibility for what 
happened January 20, 1990. The deputies of the People's Front 
of Azerbaijan and of the Party for National Independence believe 
that the political leadership of the former Soviet Union who 
took the decision to bring in troops in Baku are the main 
culprits of the tragedy.

  [Text] 53 deputies of the Estonian 101-member parliament 
on Monday presented the Riigikogu [parliament] a draft statement 
on asking parliaments of UN members states to acknowledge that 
the Baltic countries were in 1940 occupied and later annexed by 
the Soviet Union. 
  The draft statement also asks the parliaments of the 
countries to put pressure on Russia so that the legal successor 
of the defunct Soviet Union would condemn the 1940 annexation 
and the following genocide against the people of the countries. 
  Estonian parliamentary foreign relations commission has 
discussed the draft twice and a consensus has been achieved 
between different parties, Vardo Rumessen from the Estonian 
National Independence Party said upon handing over the draft. 
  Estonia wants international community to understand that the 
large number of immigrants from the former Soviet Union is a 
direct result of the annexation, following genocide and 
Russification.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 24, BNS -- Russian embassy officials 
in Tallinn have said there are 42,300 legal Russian residents 
living in Estonia, the Estonian Minister of Population, Peeter 
Olesk, said before the parliament today. 
  Estonian authorities don't know who these people are, 
because 
the Russian embassy has refused to reveal the names of its 
country's citizens here, Olesk said. 
  "Russian Ambassador Alexander Trofimov told me at the end of 
last year that the names were not to be revealed because the 
people had so requested for the fear of persecution. Some kind 
of possibility to check who these people are will come up when 
the Citizenship and Migration Department starts receiving 
applications for excluding these people from Estonian 
citizenship," the Estonian minister said. 
  Only two such applications have been submitted so far. 
  Olesk said Russia was pursuing a policy of dual citizenship, 
when Russian citizens don't have to declare giving up the other 
country's citizenship," he said. Therefore it is impossible for 
Estonian authorities to know whether a person is a Russian 
citizen, holds dual citizenship or is a stateless person, Olesk 
added. 
  The minister said that about 11,000 persons had become 
naturalized Estonian citizens after the country regained its 
independence. He didn't rule out that some of them might be 
simultaneously Russian citizens. 
  He said it was in the interests of Estonia's national 
security to avoid the formation of a large Russian citizen 
community in Estonia. He said massive presence of legal Russian 
citizens in Estonia would provide Russia with good opportunity 
to interfere with Estonia's internal affairs and prompt the 
Russian-speakers to set territorial claims.

  [Text] An Estonian parliament MP on Monday presented the 
Riigikogu [parliament] a bill on discharging Major General 
Aleksander Einseln, the head of the Estonian army. 
  Katrin Linde said in her statement that according to 
statutes 
of the headquarters of the Estonian Defence Forces, the head of 
the headquarters must also be head of the army. 
  The head of the headquarters is Colonel Ants Laaneots. 
  Nugis, the speaker of the Riigikogu, said the bill 
contradicted the constitution. 
  Linde claimed that according to the law regulating military 
service of Estonian officers, any officer older than 60 must be 
discharged from armed forces. Einseln is 63. Linde also said 
that according to the same law, no officer could be granted 
higher military rank than he had had while serving in a foreign 
army. 
  Estonian Riigikogu on May 4 last year adopted a bill making 
retired U.S. Colonel Einseln head of the Estonian army. 
President Lennart Meri later made him Major General.

  [Text] Tallinn, January 20 -- According to a cooperation

last year, Estonian Chart Centre will finish work on a complete 
and thorough up-to-date Estonian map, based on satellite photos, 
by the end of 1995, Heiki Potter of the State Land Board told 
ETA. 
  The final cost of the project is 11 million Estonian kroons 
(about 785,714 USD), 85 percent of which will be financed by 
Sweden. 
  According to an agreement between the Estonian Land Board 
and 
Swedish Satellitbild corporation, Sweden will be responsible for 
the satellite photos, digital data basis and necessary equipment 
to decode and interpret the data. The new system will allow 
continuous renewal of the basic map, survey of environmental 
situation and of how natural resources are used in Estonia. 
1,000 maps will be printed at the beginning for the use of 
state and municipality institutions.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 22, BNS -- Estonia at the moment has 
no funds available for building an internment camp for illegal 
immigrants, said the Minister of Justice Kaido Kama. 
  Kama told BNS today that construction and repair work on the 
facilities of a former prison guards' military unit base at 
Rummu would cost about 20 million kroons. 
  The project currently is in its initial stages. 
  "The Police Department says the camp must be designed for at 
least 500 persons," the minister said. He said it was still not 
clear whether the camp really needed to be as large as this. 
  The government on Sept. 14 ruled that the internment camp 
was to be located at Rummu, some 35 km to the southwest of 
Tallinn. Other possible locations discussed before that date 
included a former Soviet Army disciplinary correction unit camp 
at Paldiski, the Harku detention camp on the outskirts of 
Tallinn, and a former Communist Pioneer youth organization camp 
near the Tallinn.

  [Text] The future of Kurdish refugees in Estonia remains 
unclear as they have no documents and no country is willing to 
accept them, Valeri Kravets, deputy director of the National 
Board of Corrections, said in an interview with ETA. 
  At present, 35 Kurdish refugees, nine of them children and 
11 
women, stay at Harku prison near Tallinn, Kravets said. None of 
them holds any document, let alone visas, Kravets said while 
adding they had arrived in Estonia illegally from either Russia 
or Latvia, but Estonia could not send them back without 
documents. 
  The number of Kurdish refugees was the biggest in September 
(63), Kravets said. Those who had money and connections left 
for Sweden while others just sit and wait, he added. 
  No solution is near, Kravets said. Finland has hinted at 
accepting them, but no formal promises have been made, Kravets 
said. 
  In addition to above-mentioned refugees who had arrived in 
Estonia earlier, three Kurds had been detained at the Port of 
Tallinn on an attempt to board a ship to Sweden, Kravets said.

  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- A high-ranking Georgian 
official welcomed the upcoming signing of the friendship treaty 
between Russia and Georgia as an event of paramount importance 
for Georgia. 
  "The treaty of friendship, good neighbourly relations and 
cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Georgia which is expected to be signed during the first official 
visit to Georgia by the Russian president on February 3-4 will 
be epoch-making for Georgia," Georgian Ambassador to Russia 
Valeryan Advadze said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Advadze said "we 
have gone a long way while preparing the treaty. We have 
overcome many obstacles on our way. But today we are on the 
last lap. This has become possible due to the efforts of 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze." 
  He stressed that Yeltsin's visit to independent Georgia will 
signify that "it has been recognised by the great neighbour." 
"The upcoming visit of the Russian president to Georgia will 
help restore human relations between the people of the two 
countries," the ambassador said. 
  During the visit, the two leaders also plan to sign 
agreements on trade and economic cooperation, on the status of 
Russian border troops in Georgia, on cooperation in 
transportation, on the resettlement of refugees and other 
documents.

  [Text] The agreements to be signed during Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia have practically been 
finalized, Georgia's ambassador to Russia said. 
  Valerian Advadze told INTERFAX that Georgian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Mikhail Ukleba, who has arrived in Moscow with Prime 
Minister Otar Patsatsia, would stay in the Russian capital to 
clarify whatever unclear points might remain in the agreements. 
  According to well-informed sources, Patsatsia, whose visit 
ended on Friday, and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
gave consideration to 19 documents to be signed during Yeltsin's 
visit, scheduled for February 3-4. 
  The documents include a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation, 
agreements on trade and economic cooperation for 1994, free 
trade, the status of Russian border troops in Georgia, transport 
cooperation, water transport of cargo, and scientific and 
technological cooperation. 
  The two prime ministers also discussed the possibility of 
Russia extending its last year's credit to Georgia for this year 
and providing a new credit in addition to it, and of Russia's 
assistance in rebuilding Georgia's Black Sea ports of Poti and 
Batumi. 
  Ambassador Advadze said Georgia had asked Russia for credits 
worth tens of billions of rubles. Chernomyrdin "paid very 
serious attention to our problems, but couldn't give us a final 
answer because the budget hasn't yet been approved in Russia," 
Advadze said. 
  The ambassador said Georgia mainly needed the credits to 
keep 
its fuel and energy complex going, in particular to buy natural 
gas, residual fuel oil, gasolene, etc. Georgia imports up to 80 
percent of its energy, he said.

Russia, Germany, and Great Britain, who have spent more than a 
week in Tbilisi in order to participate in a forensic 
examination of the body of ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, 
intend to leave Georgia on 25 January. 
  Explaining the reasons for their departure, the experts 
stated that a decision on conducting the expert examination is 
being delayed for various reasons, in particular, it was noted, 
the family of the ex-president first and foremost is against 
this. 
  At the same time, the experts noted, if the Georgian 
Ministry 
of Health again invites them to the republic to take part in an 
expert examination, they intend to arrive in Tbilisi 
immediately.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Procurator General Anzor Baluashvili, </F>
head of the group investigating Abkhazian war crimes, by 
unidentified SAKINFORM correspondent; place and date not given: 
"The Abkhazian Tragedy Is a Crime Against Humanity"] 
  [Text]Atrocious crimes have been committed by 
Abkhazian separatists against the Georgian population in 
Abkhazia. As is known to the general public, criminal 
proceedings have been instituted in the Republic of Georgia 
Procurator's Office concerning the genocide and ethnic cleansing 
of the Georgian population that has been living on this ancient 
Georgian land. Regarding these facts, the investigation has 
already acquired numerous pieces of evidence that very clearly 
show the Abkhazian separatists' cruelty toward the peaceful 
population. Taking into account the very great interest of the 
public toward the investigation, our editor's office is 
continuing its series of publications on this subject. Anzor 
Baluashvili, head of the investigation group and the republic's 
deputy procurator general, spoke to a SAKINFORM correspondent 
about the incidence of genocide and ethnic cleansing of the 
Georgian population on the territory of Abkhazia by Abkhazian 
separatists. 
  [Baluashvili] Absolutely horrific facts are being 
established on the basis of research: The organized genocide of 
the native Georgian population on the territory of Abkhazia by 
Abkhazian separatists and their reactionary henchmen. The 
conspiracy to between the organizers, perpetrators, and 
accomplices in this most serious crime is clearly evident. With 
the aim of violating the territorial integrity of the Georgian 
state, Abkhazian separatists slaughtered, in an organized way 
and on a massive scale, thousands of completely innocent people 
who were sacrificed only because they were of Georgian 
nationality. With the same aim, hundreds of thousands of 
indigenous Georgians were expelled from their homes, which 
action was accompanied by indescribable terror, physical and 
psychological violence, violation of the honor and dignity of 
citizens, devastation of homes and destruction of family 
belongings, the stealing of livestock and hijacking of vehicles. 
The Georgian people were subject to conditions that would have 
resulted in their certain annihilation had they remained on this 
territory. 
  Certain people are vainly trying to deny that the genocide 
of 
the Georgian population took place in Abkhazia and explain the 
events as the cruelty that takes place during time of war. We 
state openly that this is an attempt to mislead the 
international public. The investigation will make available to 
any interested person the materials in its possession, to prove 
that systematic ethnic cleansing did indeed take place on the 
territory of Abkhazia. 
  Moreover, several issues of the newspaper would probably not 
suffice to simply list the biographical details of those persons 
who were killed by the Abkhazian separatists and their 
hirelings. Those who were slaughtered did not participate in 
military operations. You cannot find an Abkhazian town, rayon, 
and village where reprisals were not perpetrated against the 
Georgian population. In practice, military actions in Abkhazia 
ended following the fall of Sukhumi on 27 September 1993. 
However, the investigation has gathered numerous pieces of 
evidence testifying to the slaughter of the Georgian population 
on a massive scale after military actions had ended. The 
investigators know with what inhuman cynicism and brutality the 
band of separatist criminals raped women and then cut off their 
breasts while they were still alive and even raped young girls 
who had not attained puberty and cut off their nipples and kept 
them in matchboxes. I state publicly that this testimony can be 
corroborated not only by Georgians but also by Greeks, 
Armenians, Russians, and representatives of other nationalities. 
In order for the world to assess the tragedy perpetrated by the 
fascists in Abkhazia in an objective and comprehensive manner, I 
believe it is essential that international organizations become 
immediately involved in the investigation. I believe that 
riffraff have surfaced at the end of the 20th century, the 
spread of whose lifestyle causes wounds that will not heal among 
millions of inhabitants of different countries. According to 
the testimony of some people, it has also become known that, 
after killing innocent people, the vandals attached the 
following types of inscriptions to the bodies of the victims: 
"Georgians, don't eat a lot, don't get fat. It's unpleasant 
for us to drag your corpses." One cannot read without feeling 
revulsion the testimony of eyewitnesses that describes how, in 
the immediate aftermath of the fall of Sukhumi, the following 
people were slaughtered on Tsereteli Street: A. Gadelia, O. 
Gegechkori, U. Kvaratskhelia, J. Dgebuadze, T. Kakuberi- 
Gvakhariasi, and S. Kakuberi, and also the Sukhumians J. 
Dartsmelia, the Zakradze brothers, Sh. Kacharava, Eter and Zaira 
Abramia, Z. Kalandia, B. Pipia, V. Jimsheleishvili, Ts. Sharia, 
V. Kvachakhia, A. Kintsurashvili, D. Kopaliani, and M. 
Kvirchkhaia. Thousands of Georgian families residing in 
Abkhazia shared the same fate as Nugzar Varlamis dze [son of 
Varlam] Jimsheleishvili, former Abkhazian Cabinet of Ministers 
engineer. His father, Varlam Noes [son of Noe] Jimsheleishvili 
was taken prisoner, his home was ransacked, and his mother 
Babutsa Pipia and mother-in-law Mzia Kalandia were tortured to 
death. For specific reasons, I am unable to disclose the 
identity of 80-year old L.B. He was tortured to death and his 
foster child I.T., who was of Russian nationality, was shot at 
his grave for the sole reason that he had dared to bury a 
Georgian. 60-year-old M. Shonia, who was being sheltered in a 
neighbor's apartment, was killed with similar cruelty, as were 
68- year old N. Mirtskhulava, and the couple V. and A. 
Kvaratskhelidze and V. Arghvliani. 
  According to information acquired in the course of the 
investigation, people of Georgian nationality were shot 
individually and in groups. I repeat that it is possible to 
present a multitude of analogous facts. A description of the 
tragedy played out in Gali rayon and the facts about the 
slaughter there could become the subject of a separate long 
discussion. 
  The investigation into the circumstances surrounding the 
brutal murder of Jiuli Shartava, chairman of the Abkhazian 
Council of Ministers, and his associates is continuing. 
According to additional materials received by the 
investigation, it is patently clear that, following the capture 
of Giuli Shartava and his associates in Sukhumi, Abkhazian 
separatists tortured them to death with particular cruelty. 
Before being killed, they were violently tortured, which has 
been clearly corroborated by forensic examination; additional 
testimony was provided by witnesses and other evidence. It is 
confirmed beyond a doubt that the murder of J. Shartava, 
employees of the Abkhazian Cabinet of Ministers, and other 
persons was sanctioned by those who provoked the armed conflict 
against the Georgian state and its people, which subsequently 
took the form of large-scale military operations. 
  [SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA editorial note] During the course of 
the investigation, a clear picture is emerging of the identity 
of those persons who, on the instructions of the Abkhazian 
separatists, carried out the genocide of the peaceful 
population. The materials that have been gathered show that the 
tragedy played out in Abkhazia is a crime against humanity and, 
therefore, as Anzor Baluashvili, the republic's deputy 
procurator general, stated, those who participated in this crime 
should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.

  [Text] The heads of Abkhazia's liberation organization held 
a press conference in Tbilisi. The chairman of the organization, 
Boris Kakubava, member of the Georgian parliament; the political 
secretary, Malkhaz Pataraia; and Abkhazia's military commissar, 
Vakhtang Vekua, answered journalists' questions. 
  Boris Kakubava blamed the government because for four 
months, 
since handing over Abkhazia, it had done nothing for the return 
to Abkhazia, in the same way as we were evicted from there. 
  They criticized sharply the Geneva talks. We are not against 
talks, said Kakubava, but we must have a reserve of permanent 
armed forces and must not allow the Russian troops under the 
auspices of the UN into Abkhazia. 
  The members of the organization expressed the wish that as 
of 
now, representatives of the evicted population of Abkhazia 
participate in talks on settling the conflict. They protested 
against the return of refugees in the Gali rayon and justified 
their protest by the fact that it was being conducted under the 
jurisdiction of the [Abkhaz] separatists and that the civilians 
would have no security guarantees. Our only aim is to return to 
Abkhazia, said Boris Kakubava, and every lost day makes it 
unlikely.

  [Text] Abkhazia's mass media reports that Vladislav 
Ardzinba, chairman of Abkhazia's Supreme Council, in an 
interview with Abkhaz television said that only those Georgian 
refugees who had not participated in the war and had not shed 
blood in Abkhazia could return to Abkhazia. 
  A SAKINFORM [Georgian press agency] correspondent, Tengiz 
Pachkoria, asked Akaki Gasviani, deputy chairman of Abkhazia's 
Council of Ministers, to comment on this statement. 
  Gasviani said: We consider Ardzinba's statement to reflect 
an attempt to revise and reconsider the Geneva agreement 
envisaging the return of all refugees. Ardzinba and his 
supporters, who on several occasions violated the Sochi 
agreement on settling the Abkhaz conflict peacefully, are now 
trying to violate the Geneva agreements and the communique. 
Obviously, the return of dozens of thousands of refugees to the 
Gali and Abkhazia's other rayons is not suitable for them. This 
statement by Ardzinba is a fresh attempt at holding the Georgian 
population and the Georgian Government responsible for the 
actions committed by the Abkhaz and the north Caucasian 
combatants who had killed and pillaged the civilian population 
of the autonomous republic--Georgians, Russians, Greeks, and 
others--and for the combatants' actions--bombing and shelling 
residential areas of Sukhumi and Abkhazia's other towns and 
rayons. As for the criminal offenses committed in Abkhazia in 
1992-93, we must investigate thoroughly these instances, and 
criminal proceedings must be instituted against perpetrators 
irrespective of their nationality.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tengiz Pachkoriya] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi January 24 TASS -- A Georgian top official 
has denounced Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba for his 
statement barring Georgian refugees who fought on the side of 
Georgian troops from returning to Abkhazia. 
  Ardzinba told Abkhazian television that only those Georgian 
refugees who have not "stained themselves with blood" may return 
to Abkhazia. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Akaky Gasviani, a 
vice- prime minister of the Georgian government-in-exile of 
Abkhazia, described Ardzinba's statement as "an attempt to 
revise and reconsider the Geneva agreements envisaging the 
return to Abkhazia of refugees of all nationalities irrespective 
of their participation in combat activities." 
  He said the Abkhazian leadership "is obviously not happy 
about the return of several dozen thousand refugees to the Gali 
and other districts of Abkhazia and it is trying, under various 
pretexts, to obstruct the process of their return." 
  Gasviani stressed that Ardzinba's statement "is a new 
attempt 
to shift the responsibility for the activities of Abkhazian and 
North Caucasian militants who robbed and killed civilians in 
Abkhazia -- Georgians, Russians, Greeks and people of other 
nationalities -- in September-December 1993 to the Georgian 
population and Georgian authorities."

<F P=106> [Interview with Givi Lominadze, state minister and chairman </F>
of the Temporary Committee for the State of Emergency in Western 
Georgia, by Armaz Saneblidze in Senaki; date not given: 
"Turning Back"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Saneblidze] A person 
arriving in Samegrelo [Mingrelia, former stronghold of Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia] can see that the mood has obviously changed. The 
local situation is gradually improving. Batono Givi, is this 
really the case? 
  [Lominadze] That is correct. As someone who is involved in 
affairs here 24 hours a day and for whom such a change should 
apparently be less noticeable, I can indeed see that it has 
changed. Compared with the first few weeks, there is a big 
difference. The situation has clearly improved. [passage 
omitted] 
  However, believe me when I say in all seriousness that we 
are 
a long way from achieving stability. I cannot say that 
everything has already been put right in western Georgia. More 
or less, only more or less. 
  If, for example, we are not facing the problem of violent 
interference on the part of the opposing side and an 
exacerbation of the situation in both the Guria and Imereti 
zones and in Samtredia, Vani, and Khoni where this question is 
no longer on the agenda, we can expect complications at any 
moment in Zugdidi, Tsalenjikha, Chkhorotsqu, and Senaki. 
  This we know from information and analytical materials in 
our 
possession and from having our finger on the pulse of the 
sociopolitical life in this region. I do not exclude that one 
fine day, a certain armed force will burst into Zugdidi or 
Senaki or Khobi or Tsalenjikha or Chkhorotsqu and declare that 
they have restored the jurisdiction of the legal authorities, as 
they call them. 
  As I have said, there is no danger of this occurring in the 
rayons of Guria and Imereti. However, they are faced with all 
those economic and social problems that exist throughout 
Georgia; these are being felt more painfully as the local 
population has experienced the fear of weapons and insults on 
the part of the supporters of the ex-president. 
  Compared with other areas of Samegrelo, the situation is 
different in Poti. There, economic and social problems have to 
be resolved, although I would say that the criminal situation is 
stable -- at least, it is under control. 
  There is a difference regarding economic and political 
problems themselves: For example, there is one set of such 
problems in Senaki and Poti and another in Tsalenjikha and 
Chkhorotsqu. Sometimes the difference is sharp. 
  Finally, I would say that the difference between what we 
encountered there first and the situation today is like that 
between day and night. 
  Naturally, it would have been desirable to have gotten the 
factories and establishments working more quickly, but this 
would have been the best that we could have expected. 
  What did we first encounter? The railway was destroyed; 
there were no buses; naturally, there was no gas or electricity; 
the medical establishments were ransacked; there was no bread or 
water. There was nothing. There were more than 200 destroyed 
houses in Senaki alone; the people were frightened. The 
situation was the same in Abasha and Khobi and the towns and 
villages were so empty that it seemed that no one was left alive. 
  What are things like today? All the tea-processing plants 
are functioning as best they can given the reduced electric 
power supplies. We arrived just in time as the sanitary 
conditions were so bad that all kinds of infections could have 
broken out at any moment. Our most pressing problem during the 
first 10 days was cleaning up the towns. 
  Stability will only come when justice reigns, law and order 
is established, and the factories and establishments are working. 
  The realization of these factors will save the whole of 
Georgia and western Georgia, in particular. 
  We probably need to conduct the merciless struggle against 
bandit formations for one to one and a half years. Do not think 
that all those people who have gone into the woods will give 
themselves up, lay down their weapons, stand at the side of the 
road or go back to the tea plantations or do what they were 
doing before. 
  They will not do this; they have gotten used to doing no 
work. Armed with machine guns, they can appear on the highway 
and obtain in five minutes what they would have earned in 10 
years. Try convincing those people now to lay down their 
weapons, as this will be good for them and necessary for Georgia 
and to go back to picking tea leaves. A difficult thing, don't 
you think? 
  [Saneblidze]Of course. 
  [Lominadze] It is difficult but absolutely necessary and it 
has to be done through systematic and purposeful propaganda and 
actions and not, as some leaders imagine, by thinking that, 
having entered these places, there is nothing else for us to do 
but sit idly by and wait for the results. 
  This was precisely the mood when we entered Abkhazia. Yes, 
we did get from the Inguri River to Sukhumi! However, we did 
not advance further. It is well known what the consequences of 
this were for us. The same thing could possibly happen here as 
well. 
  There was no hand-to-hand combat in Senaki or Khobi or 
Zugdidi or anywhere else. However, although those armed people 
have dispersed, they still exist, do they not? Of course they 
do. Who can guarantee to us that they will not unite again or 
will not use those socioeconomic problems that exist in reality 
for their own purposes? No one. 
  Finally, there is a trend toward an improvement of the 
situation. However, we must not relax our efforts for a single 
moment. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Algirdas Brazauskas by Yuriy </F>
Stroganov in Vilnius; date not given: "Algirdas Brazauskas: We 
Remain Good Neighbors"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- The figure of Algirdas Brazauskas, 
former secretary of the Communist Party of Lithuania Central 
Committee, has long since ceased to be a bogeyman to the West. 
Britain and Germany have already overtaken Russia in terms of 
the quantity of resources invested in the republic's economy. 
  The former communists headed by Algirdas Brazauskas 
abandoned 
their former dogmas, renamed a section of the Communist Party of 
Lithuania the Democratic Labor Party, and won back the people's 
trust. At the 1992 elections they won a majority in the new 
parliament, known here as the Seimas. In February 1993 their 
leader became president. Our conversation with A. Brazauskas 
began with his heavy burden and the prospects facing the 
republic on its difficult road. 
  [Stroganov] Mr. President, in a public opinion poll 
conducted in Lithuania at the end of 1993 you were voted "man of 
the year," with opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis, your 
perpetual adversary, a long way behind. Why was that? 
  [Brazauskas] Presumably it was because of our party's 
political line, which is to do everything to ensure that the 
predominant factor in society is stability based on mutual 
understanding and respect for different opinions. And second, 
to carry out reforms at the least possible cost. It seems that 
people find this line acceptable. 
  [Stroganov] Is your workload as president different from 
that which you bore prior to the proclamation of independence, 
when you were head of what was then still the Lithuanian Soviet 
parliament and the Communist Party? 
  [Brazauskas] On 25 February, incidentally, it will be one 
year to the day since I entered office as president. The result 
of that year is this: Lithuania is living according to the 
Constitution adopted by universal suffrage. Almost all the 
institutions of power have been created according to the 
fundamental law: The Constitutional Court, the Seimas, and the 
government are functioning and there is now a new institution 
which did not exist a year ago -- the President's Service. 
  It goes without saying that the president's workload is 
considerably different from my past work. Because you bear the 
responsibility not for such matters as the construction 
industry, for example, or the whole economy, but rather you feel 
responsible for the prosperity and the future of all Lithuania's 
citizens, all the republic's population. The people's trust 
cannot be compared with the trust of the party Central Committee. 
  [Stroganov] One of the main arguments used by the opposition 
as it increases the pressure on the republic's authorities is 
that in the past year Lithuania's economic situation has not 
only not improved but has actually continued to worsen. Is that 
so? 
  [Brazauskas] Let us compare the figures. During 1993, when 
the government was being formed, the president was elected, and 
the Seimas began to operate, we managed to stop the national 
economy moving toward catastrophe. In the second half of 1993 
signs of stabilization appeared. Income rose at approximately 
the same rate as expenditure. The rate of inflation slowed 
sharply. Recently it was in the range of 1-7 percent a month. 
Wages and pensions have risen monthly. The national currency 
has stabilized: A steady rate is being maintained. 
  Of course we have many problems. Take agriculture, for 
example. We did not have time to create an alternative to the 
former collective farm system. Everyone voted and we are voting 
for individual farming and the return of property. But this 
property must be used in such a way as to guarantee people 
incomes and the state a product. Unfortunately this has not 
been achieved yet. We have made some adjustments to the 
agricultural reform as it was previously conceived, but 
unfortunately this was late. 
  [Stroganov] On the subject of agriculture, a republic 
farmers' strike is being prepared. What is the background to 
this: Is it political or economic? 
  [Brazauskas] The opposition is demanding early elections. 
The Constitution and other laws do not rule out that 
possibility. However, I personally do not see any need for that. 
And I doubt that the people will support the idea of early 
elections. 
  However, the strike's organizers are trying to show the 
people that such questions are not being resolved and are 
arousing interest in fresh elections. A strike will not help 
matters, rather it will aggravate the situation for people in 
the countryside. 
  [Stroganov] Mr. President, in your view what is the present 
state of Russian-Lithuanian relations? How can they be 
developed further, in your opinion? 
  [Brazauskas] I regard our relations with Russia as normal. 
Agreements were signed on a whole series of questions, economic 
questions first of all, when Mr. Chernomyrdin visited Lithuania 
in mid-November. These agreements form the basis for the 
further development of relations. We are ready to deepen and 
improve those relations, bearing in mind that there is a 
situation here which does not exist in any of Russia's former 
Soviet republic neighbors. I mean the matter of Kaliningrad 
Oblast. I believe that the questions which the Russian 
Government is raising about ensuring the oblast's vital activity 
will be resolved and that talks will continue. This question is 
important both to Russia and to us -- for our normal relations. 
  [Stroganov] Russia is first in terms of the number of joint 
ventures in Lithuania -- there are almost 900 of them. But in 
terms of investments Russia is only in third place. This means 
that there are lots of small enterprises. I know that there are 
plans for the creation of large-scale joint ventures. But at 
the same time the Lithuanian opposition is actively working 
against them because it is afraid of the powerful influence of 
the Russian economy on the republic. What course will your 
government opt for? 
  [Brazauskas] The opposition's reacts touchily to this 
problem because it thinks that we are going to "sell Lithuania 
off lock, stock, and barrel." But I think that partnership in 
the economy and the development of economic ties with Russia 
will continue. We do not intend to discriminate against it in 
the process of the flotation of enterprises either. The more 
foreign capital from different countries of the world that there 
is in Lithuania and the more economic and other ties there are 
with other states, the stronger it will be economically and the 
more guarantees of the country's independence there will be. 
  [Stroganov] In your letter to NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner you expressed Lithuania's will to join that 
organization. What do you think about Russia's reaction to that? 
  [Brazauskas] We expected such a reaction from Russia. 
However, I certainly do not believe that this reaction will 
change the good mutual relations between Lithuania and Russia. 
  I want to reiterate what I said in my statement on 4 
January. 
Lithuania's position toward NATO is not directed against 
neighboring countries or any other states in Europe. We believe 
that both the character and the aims of NATO have changed since 
the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist. In addition, Lithuania does 
not seek isolation from its eastern neighbors and neither 
expresses nor encourages the psychology of bloc thinking. We 
believe that the more countries there are under the umbrella of 
European collective security the more calmly we shall enter the 
21st century. 
  [Stroganov] Do you link Lithuania's destiny with Russia's? 
  [Brazauskas] You know that one can talk about shared 
destinies only in the sense of the extent to which our countries 
use mutually beneficial ties to enable them both to emerge from 
the economic crisis as quickly as possible. 
  I would like to recall here the Lithuanian Republic's 
constitutional act of 8 June 1992, which says that we will 
develop mutually beneficial ties with each state which used to 
belong to the USSR. However, we will never enter into any kind 
of new political, military, economic, or other state unions or 
commonwealths created on the basis of the former USSR. 
  I should like to wish Russia's citizens fortitude on their 
path toward prosperity: May the strengthening of democracy and 
the creation of the market economy bring real benefit as quickly 
as possible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys by </F>
Gintaras Vinickas in Vilnius; date not given: "Povilas Gylys: 
`Success Always Has Many Parents'"] 
  [Text] A few days have passed since Lithuania expressed 
its desire to be admitted to NATO. What has been the 
international reaction? Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas 
Gylys has answered this and other questions from our 
correspondent. 
  [Gylys] Reaction has been coming in from all sides: We have 
responses from our neighboring Estonians and Latvians, and from 
Russia. I would say that they are normal. 
  I think that our desire was unexpected to many countries, 
even though we have maintained close contacts with NATO. Last 
spring, I met with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. 
Recently, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius visited the 
NATO headquarters. Our president has been corresponding with 
the secretary general. We have also expressed our position on 
NATO at its Cooperation Council and the CSCE forum. I have 
detailed our stand to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
during his meeting with the Baltic foreign ministers in Riga. 
  The reaction from the Baltic states is slightly different. 
Estonia's response is more reserved. By the way, the Baltic 
states were informed about our move in advance. 
  I would like to say that Russia could also contribute to the 
creation of a new security system in Europe. This will become 
possible when democratic tendencies win once and for all in 
Russia. 
  Adopting this decision, Lithuania followed its interests of 
national security. This decision is not directed against 
anyone. We are moving into an era of nonconfrontational politics. 
  [Vinickas] We have heard some voices claiming that the 
expressed desire to join NATO is the opposition's 
accomplishment. Could you comment on this? 
  [Gylys] It is said that success always has many parents, 
while failures are orphans. 
  I do not deny the opposition's contribution, but I remind 
everyone that the joint Seimas [parliament] resolution on 
foreign policy issues was supported by the votes of the 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction. It is then 
that the president was advised to apply for NATO membership. 
  The LDDP leadership considered this issue thoroughly for a 
long time. Our stand was as follows: Lithuania should 
participate in international security structures. 
  I admit that the opposition and the ruling force must look 
for common interests, if this is possible, and seek a consensus. 
However, the statements that, for example, all moves of the 
opposition are positive, while those of the government are 
correct only due to pressure, do not enlarge our possibilities 
to conduct a national foreign policy, as our opponents say. I 
see a contradiction between the urge to conduct such a policy 
and a completely negative reaction to our each move which the 
opposition approves. 
  [Vinickas] It is understandable that joining NATO is a 
process. In your opinion, when will it be possible to find out 
whether NATO approves of this process? 
  [Gylys] I would note that it was important to us to state 
our 
position. 
  I think that the NATO summit will discuss its future 
strategy 
and place in the contemporary world. 
  The rapprochement between NATO and Central and Eastern 
Europe 
should be mutual. NATO must make up its mind concerning its 
approach to Eastern and Central Europe: It would either adhere 
to old and tougher principles or lower the crossbar slightly and 
speed up the process of integration in creating a common 
European security system. Western politicians say that they 
would not like to create conditions for a recurrence of 
confronting blocs. 
  We could also speak about our preparedness. Lithuania's 
current military budget is "transparent." On the other hand, we 
must achieve public control of our military structures, because 
such demands are being put on us. 
  I would confirm that the movement toward NATO is an 
evolutionary process. We could only ask whether this evolution 
would be intensified. This does not depend on Lithuania alone. 
  One is often left with the impression that some Lithuanian 
politicians believe that foreign policy is conducted as if of 
its own volition. However, this is not the case. As an 
imposing organization, NATO understands its dilemmas and is 
aware of its responsibility to preserve peace on the continent. 
  [Vinickas] Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] Vilnius, 19 Jan -- A letter by Lithuanian Foreign 
Minister Povilas Gylys was handed over to Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias by Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas 
Januska visiting Greece. 
  Gylys stated in the letter that Lithuania called to start 
the 
negotiations on the associative agreement with the European 
Union [EU]. 
  It is noted in the letter that the dynamic development of 
economic and political situation in Eastern and Central Europe 
increases the necessity to create effective forms of integration 
into the European Union for the Baltic States. 
  Lithuania expressed its wish that the future free trade 
agreement with EU should comply with the commercial part of the 
associative agreement. 
  Gylys urged the Council of Europe to adopt the decision 
which 
would allow to transform the free trade agreement between EU and 
Lithuania into the associative agreement. 
  Greece presides in the Council of Europe during the first 
half of the year.

<F P=106> [Article by Gediminas Kirkilas, first deputy chairman of the </F>
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party: "The Itch of Early 
Elections"] 
  [Excerpts] Continuing their "best" party traditions, the 
nationalists "shook" Lithuania's political world before 
Christmas by inviting constituents and other political forces to 
early elections.... [passage omitted] 
  Currently, we have a valid Constitution adopted in a 
national 
referendum, and its Article 55 states that the Seimas 
[parliament] term in office is four years. True, the 
Constitution specifies several cases when early Seimas elections 
can be held. This could happen if three-fifths of the 
legislature could no longer work together, or if three principal 
governing institutions -- the Seimas, the government, and the 
president -- could not agree among themselves. 
  We have neither case today. Cooperation among all of these 
institutions is quite good. Their conflicts, if any, could be 
resolved by the Constitutional Court. Thus, there are no 
reasons for holding early elections today. There is nothing 
except a great and almost sickly desire of the losers to take 
their revenge and return to power. [passage omitted] 
  What is the purpose of this goal? Is there a desire to 
assist the country at this difficult moment with ideas and 
constructive proposals on how to continue reform? Do the 
nationalists and other political parties seeking early elections 
have any great ideas that could lead the state out of a crisis? 
Might these parties have many candidates for ministers, prime 
ministers, and government officials? However, Lithuanians 
already saw their "skills" and assessed them in the 1992 Seimas 
elections. Have these political forces evaluated their mistakes 
and changed their principles and values within a year? It seems 
that they have not! They are continuing to incite people, 
increase tension, look for their own people, and so on. 
  It is obvious that these parties are not rich in intellect. 
Why is it necessary to destabilize the situation in the country 
again? Maybe, they want our potential economic and political 
foreign partners to begin to assess our situation as unstable. 
These reasons might force them to hesitate and refrain from 
large investments. 
  Do not the goals of certain political forces coincide with 
the aims of those "foreign political forces" which are against 
Lithuania's independence? The fact that it is these forces who 
often take care of our country's independence by means of words 
does not mean that these words conform with their deeds. 
  If the Lithuanian people approved a four-year term in office 
for the Seimas by voting for the Constitution in a referendum, 
this is a law that must be observed by all political forces. 
New elections will be held in four years (by the way, only 
three years are left), while now oppositional parties have 
enough time to prepare themselves for the next elections and to 
work constructively for Lithuania's benefit, if they seek this 
not just by means of words. 
  I can comfort those who are so fond of elections. After the 
adoption of the law on self-governments, Lithuania will hold 
elections almost every year: One year we will elect the 
president, another year -- the Seimas, and every two years -- 
self-governments. Thus, we will be able to exercise in politics 
each year, and all parties will have work up to their eyes. It 
is very important both to constituents and to political parties 
to preserve such regularity. Voters will be able to assess more 
seriously different parties, their people, and "teams" that 
would form the government, and so on. Therefore, the voters' 
choice will be less influenced by various coincidences. Parties 
will be forced to prepare themselves with greater care, 
particularly when selecting their people. In general, politics 
will become professional. [passage omitted] 
  "Thinking objectively," claims political scientist A. 
Krupavicius, "there are no arguments for early Seimas elections 
today." Then why has this statement been exploited 
practically... since the first round of the 1992 Seimas 
elections? A. Krupavicius believes that the opposition must 
"accustom constituents to the thought of early elections," and 
not only to this. Oppositional parties must sustain the 
"militant" spirit among their members and supporters, and 
encourage themselves continuously that the new elections will be 
held soon.... Such tactics allow opposition leaders to keep 
silent before their party members concerning the reasons for 
defeat in the former elections. In normal democratic countries, 
leaders of defeated parties usually resign with honor. We have 
the opposite situation -- they have not only refused to resign 
but have also raised themselves above others again or promoted 
themselves. Only V. Radzvilas, former leader of the liberals, 
is a pleasant exception here. 
  The third reason is that constant talk about early Seimas 
elections is a peculiar form of pressure. For example, some 
worker who sees the negative developments in his collective may 
get frightened, or some higher or lower local official, 
incapable of solving human problems or unwilling to do so, may 
explain that "elections are not far off, our people will come, 
and so on...." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F>
Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and 
others] 
  [Text] A concrete date for the possible meeting between 
Azeri President Gaydar Aliyev and his Armenian counterpart Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan in Moscow has not been fixed yet, the special 
envoy of President Yeltsin, Vladimir Kazimirov, who leads 
Russia's mission for settling the conflict in Karabakh, told 
INTERFAX on Monday [24 January]. 
  "Meetings on such a level should be prepared very 
carefully," 
he pointed out. "It's premature to mention concrete dates 
before concluding preparations that would ensure success for the 
proposed summit," he said. 
  According to Kazimirov, Russian mediators intend to continue 
the work they are conducting "in the three major points of the 
conflict" -- Baku, Yerevan, and Stepanakert, as well as in 
Moscow. "As long as we are at this stage, I am not in a 
position to say when this work can be raised to a higher level," 
the diplomat said. 
  The meetings held in Moscow recently by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev with his Azeri and Armenian counterparts 
Gasan Gasanov and Vagan Papazian, as well as with a spokesman 
for the leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh, Arkadiy Gukasyan, showed 
that "the stands taken by the conflicting sides drew somewhat 
closer," he noted. 
  Nevertheless, the talks were "rather complicated," Kazimirov 
said. "We are dealing with one of the fiercest and longest 
conflicts in the territory of the former USSR. Therefore it 
would be naive to believe that the entire knot of problems will 
be untangled to the satisfaction of all the parties concerned 
overnight. We proceed from the assumption that a settlement 
will be gradual, that it will consist of searches for 
compromises on virtually all points," the diplomat said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 21, BNS -- Mercenaries from Estonia and 
Lithuania fight as part of the Armenian troops in the conflict 
over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, said a Russian soldier taken 
prisoner by Azerbaijani forces in December. 
  A BNS correspondent has seen videotapes of the interrogation 
of the Russian soldier, Vasily Lugovoy, by Azerbaijani Interior 
Minister Vagif Novruzov. 
  Lugovoy at interrogations in the Azerbaijani capital Baku on 
Jan. 15 said he had met three female snipers near the 
Juhhar-Bahmal village in the conflict region on Dec. 28 and 29. 
  The three woman soldiers had claimed they were from the 
Baltics. Lugovoy says the women had talked with what he called a 
Baltic accent and were either Lithuanians or Estonians. 
  Lugovoy, a former Soviet military, served as mercenary in a 
pioneer unit of the Armenian troops. He said he had also 
previously met both male and female wage soldiers from Estonia 
and Lithuania. He said the Armenians valued highly the skills of 
"mercenaries from the Baltics" and paid them in U.S. dollars. 
Lugovoy said Russian soldiers earned 35,000 rubles a day in the 
Karabakh fighting in late 1993. 
  The Russian soldier also said in the interrogation he had 
been told that "two Baltic mercenaries" were granted the rank of 
senior lieutenant of the Armenian Armed Forces and that they had 
received a personal gun as gift from Armenia. 
  Lugovoy, born in 1960, formerly served in the Soviet troops 
in Germany. 
  A BNS correspondent earlier has met with an artillery 
officer 
fighting on the Armenian side in Nagorno-Karabakh, who said he 
came from Estonia. The man, however, was not ethnic Estonian.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 21, BNS -- The Senior Officials 
Committee of the Council of the Baltic Sea States adopted a 
budget for the institution of the council's Commissioner for 
Human Rights and Ethnic Minority Issues and discussed possible 
nominations for the office. 
  The Senior Officials Committee met in Tallinn on Jan. 20-21. 
  A final decision on establishing the new commissioner's 
institution with the Council of the Baltic Sea States must be 
made by the council's foreign ministers at conference to be held 
in Tallinn in May, said Mare Kukk, the head of the Estonian 
coordination bureau of the council. 
  Kukk said the new office was designed as an expert 
institution to consult the council's member countries, 
coordinate the activities of human rights organizations and 
inform the international community about the human rights and 
minority rights situation in region. 
  The commissioner will not engage in resolving conflicts, 
Kukk 
added. 
  The draft of the commissioner's mandate was approved by the 
senior officials in September. 
  The budget of the new office, established at about 270,000 
German marks, is much smaller than that of the CSCE High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and Ethnic Minorities. Expenses 
will be covered proportionally by all members of the council 
according to the size of the country.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- IZVESTIYA on the state of 
affairs in the Russian parliament and government: 
  "Unity in the Federal Assembly will be achieved, perhaps, 
only at a desperate moment when (in May or June, according to 
forecasts) inflation will reach its peak once again and deputies 
of various political orientation, in order to save face, will 
concertedly put to the vote the question of confidence in the 
government, no longer regarding it either as a 'friend' or 
'foe'". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject: 
  "The first round of struggle in the State Duma has ended. In 
a relatively peaceful way. The Duma has got down to work. What 
the results will be, good or bad, will be shown by the first 
laws which the Duma will pass." 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an article by Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
chairman of the Russian Communist Party group in the State Duma. 
  Zyuganov writes as follows: 
  "To develop a legislative basis is undoubtedly an essential 
thing to do. But it is clear to any unprejudiced observer that 
the country's present-day problems lie on a somewhat different 
plane. 
  "We suffer from a deficit of legality, not a deficit of 
laws. 
None of the existing laws is being properly enacted and, what is 
most dangerous, an example in this respect is being set by top 
executive structures with the president at the head... 
  "The question is as follows: either legality is restored, or 
the country would plunge deeper and deeper into the quagmire of 
an economic catastrophe and a slugglishly proceeding civil war 
which threatens to develop into a full-scale one at any moment". 
  IZVESTIYA on economic problems: 
  "Since the position of Finance Minister Boris Fedorov has 
not 
yet been decided upon, it is unclear which matters of 
relationships with international financial organisations will be 
tackled by which ministry". 
  New Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, "judging by his 
remarks, is ready for a certain compromise. At the same time he 
said the Economics Ministry should be in control of the entire 
economic situation, including foreign economic relations". 
  IZVESTIYA, in another article on economic issues, points out 
that Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko "is really convinced 
that monetary injections and the restoration of old economic 
contacts would boost production and make it possible to move on 
to a market economy smoothly by state regulation methods." 
  "'Smoothly' and 'state regulation' are exceptionally 
important from the personal point of view as well. Mr 
Gerashchenko has already staked out a claim for the job of a 
chairman of the interstate bank of CIS countries. 
  "If the monetary system of Russia is combined, to begin 
with, 
with those of Belarus and Tajikistan. And the 'wrong' done to 
Messr Nazarbayev and Karimov is then 'redressed', it will turn 
out that Gerashchenko would again emerge as the head of an 
almost gosbank of the Soviet Union. If this office is approved 
by the parliaments of 5-7 countries, no Russian reformers would 
be able to topple the head of such an institution. This will be 
like the chief justice of the Supreme Court in America who is 
elected for life." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an exclusive interview with 
President Mintimer Shaymiyev of Tatarstan after his January 21 
meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  "We consider that Tatarstan should be represented in the 
federal parliament. But, in order to secure that the population 
of the republic show activism, it is essential to sign a 
bilateral treaty. It is simply naive to expect the electorate to 
be active without determining a relationship formula", Shaymiyev 
said. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on service in the Russian Army 
under contract: 
  "Of course, a service under contract is to a large extent a 
solution to the problem of manning the Army and Navy. There are 
already 120,000 servicemen who have been enlisted under contract 
but this accounts for only 10 per cent of the needed strength." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with prominent 
political figure Valentin Falin, the author of a book entitled 
"Political Reminiscences" which became a bestseller in Germany. 
  In the book, Falin analyses the events which preceded the 
reunification of Germany. 
  "A contemplating attitude is not for great powers. When 
German reunificaiton was knocking at the door, it was not enough 
to appeal to a future verdict of history", Falin emphasises. 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on a presidential decree and a State Duma 
draft resolution on an amnesty. 
  Leading experts from the Russian Interior Ministry's 
research 
institute, in comment on the decree and the State Duma draft 
resolution, explain that the issue of the presidential decree 
and the publication of a draft resolution on an amnesty do not 
at all mean that an amnesty has already been decided upon. Only 
a decree about bringing the draft resolution up for 
consideration by the deputies enters into force. 
  The Duma has the right to and is certain to introduce 
considerable changes to the document. 
  On the whole, the experts maintain, the draft resolution 
which is being suggested for discussion does not basically 
differ in any way from those which had been repeatedly passed 
before. 
  The draft resolution has been drawn up competently from the 
legal point of view and can in no way make for an increased 
tension in society. The main positive aspect of it is that the 
suggested amnesty would not apply to habitual criminals but 
would concern only those convicted for offences which do not 
pose grave danger to society. 
  IZVESTIYA on Lithuanian-Polish relations: 
  "Over the past two an a half years, there has been no 
serious 
rapprochement in the slightest degree between the two 
neighbouring countries whose cultures, traditions and religion 
are very similar... Fear of Polish expansion compels the 
Lithuanian authorities to tackle problems concerning ethnic 
Poles by methods which are far from being democratic."

  [Text] The Russian president has appointed Aleksandr 
M.Yakovlev, D.Sc. (Law), Professor of the Institute of State and 
Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as his representative at 
the Federal Assembly. 
  In an interview with Interfax Monday, Yakovlev said that he 
would be responsible for interaction between the president and 
parliamentary structures. He said that the new Russian 
Constitution provides the right of the legislative initiative 
for the president. As the president's representative in the 
Federal Assembly, Yakovlev will represent the legislative 
initiatives, follow their discussion in parliamentary factions 
and committees and search for ways for compromises in case of 
objections. 
  At the same time he considers it necessary to take care of 
the "reverse contact," that is of informing the president on 
sentiments, wishes and complaints of deputies so that the 
contact be harmonious and there will be no tensions due to thee 
shortage of information. 
  According to Yakovlev, he was informed about the new 
appointment on January 24 by the president's chief of staff 
Sergey Filatov, who met Yakovlev earlier and informed him of his 
new duties. 
  Yakovlev was born in 1927 in Leningrad. He worked for 
institutes of law (of the Interior Ministry, the Prosecutor 
General's Office, and the USSR Justice Ministry). Since 1975 he 
has been working for the Institute of State and Law of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences. 
  He has said that performing the duties of the Russian 
president's representative in the Federal Assembly, he intends 
to continue his membership in the Learned Council of the 
Institute and use the potential of this institution for 
developing draft laws. 
  Yakovlev has parliamentary experience because he was deputy 
to the Soviet Supreme Soviet. 
  As it has become known to Interfax, he was a co-author of 
the 
provision "On the President's Representative in the Federal 
Assembly." Yeltsin signed the decree on introducing the post to 
help provide the interaction between the president and the 
Federal Assembly on January 18.

<F P=106> [Report by Petr Zhuravlev in the "Parliament" column: </F>
"President Yeltsin Invites the Duma To Grant an Amnesty; A 
Communist Representative Calls for the Release of Members of the 
State Committee for the State of Emergency"] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has sent an edict, 
dated 21 January, On the State Duma Draft Resolution on Granting 
Amnesty, to the lower house of the Federal Assembly. Using his 
power to initiate legislation and "taking guidance from the 
principles of humanism," as the document says, and also 
following the adoption of the Russian Federation constitution, 
the president proposes that pardon be granted to those convicted 
of committing crimes "that do not constitute a great social 
danger." 
  As Duma Deputy Chairman Mikhail Mityukov (Russia's Choice) 
told journalists, what is involved is "a limited range of 
people" which is "understandable, given the present crime 
situation in the country." Amnesty will not be granted to those 
who have been convicted of grave crimes (the edict enumerates 53 
articles of the Penal Code), especially dangerous recidivists, 
those who maliciously break penal colonies rules, and also those 
who were once amnestied or pardoned but have again found 
themselves behind bars. 
  Under the draft, subject to be released are those who "did 
their service in the active army or formations or took part in 
actions to protect the Motherland," as well as women, men over 
age 60, first and second category invalids, and persons serving 
their sentences for committing inadvertent crimes and sentenced 
to terms of up to five years (provided they have served not less 
than one-third of their terms), those under age with terms under 
three years, and those who have committed premeditated crimes 
but were also sentenced to terms under three years. The amnesty 
is also to apply to those convicted with suspended sentences or 
put on probation. 
  Commenting on the presidential edict, Mr. Mityukov described 
it as a reasonable initiative, once again stressing that the 
proposed amnesty "is fairly limited in scale." The latter 
assessment is also shared by Viktor Ilyukhin (Russian Federation 
Communist Party), chairman of the Duma Security Committee, who 
nonetheless told SEGODNYA's correspondent about his negative 
attitude to wide amnesties in general. At the same time, Mr. 
Ilyukhin spoke in favor of granting a "political amnesty" which 
should, in his view, include the people arrested following last 
year's (February and March) demonstrations in Moscow, the 3-4 
October events, and also defendants in the case of the State 
Committee for the State of Emergency. 
  The president's edict On the State Duma Draft Resolution on 
Granting Amnesty is to be considered this week by the House 
Council (the speaker and faction leaders), then transferred to 
the committee on legislation and legal reform, and only then, 
with the requisite comments, be submitted to a full session.

  [Text] Ulan Ude January 24 TASS--"The Federation Council 
supports the correction of the course of economic reform," 
Leonid Potapov, Buryatia's parliament chairman who is also a 
member of the Federation Council, told a news conference in Ulan 
Ude on Monday [24 January]. 
  Potapov believes that "revolutionary romanticism, liberalism 
and monetarism should give way to the processes of state 
regulation during the transition to a market economy, while 
personnel changes in the government should correct the course of 
economic reform to bring it in line with the existing 
monopolised economy." 
  He stressed that "pragmatists in the new government can find 
specialists who will be able to move reforms from `the worst to 
the best' and expand the social basis of reform." 
  At the same time, he pointed to the importance of the 
constructive opposition to the government on the part of 
"supporters of radical economic approaches who have resigned."

<F P=106> ["Week In Parliament" article by Vladimir Yermolin: </F>
"Parliamentary Committee Teams Manned. Good Luck!"] 
  [Text] After two weeks of work, the State Duma took a 
breather until 1 February. It was expected that the deputies 
would hurry back to their voters to share their first 
impressions and hear the initial reactions to their activities 
as deputies, but many parliamentarians remained in Moscow. By 
no means have all the questions of work and daily life been 
settled. Setting up in a new place is a complicated business. 
This also applies to the workplace -- who sits where and in 
what kind of surroundings. You would not give this job to any 
highly paid assistant. 
  The committee arrangements, now generally completed, give 
some idea of the Duma members' aspirations. Let us dwell on two 
for the moment. The most densely populated is the Budget, 
Taxes, Banks, and Finance Committee. According to the latest 
figures, it will have 43 members. "Russia's Choice" and "New 
Regional Policy" [NRP] will have the numerical majority, with 
nine representatives each. The remaining factions are 
represented by between two and four deputies. It is interesting 
that before being elected to parliament, 20 of the 43 Duma 
members who wanted to make their mark in this sphere of 
legislation were directors of small enterprises or trade houses, 
chairmen of commercial banks, or presidents of private 
investment funds: in short, people who understand budgets, 
taxes, banks, and finance. It is also interesting that even the 
factions that are ideologically incompatible delegated "private 
capital" representatives to the committee. The stratum of 
economists is very thin. The conclusion is that the division in 
the committee will not be along notorious "monetarist-producer" 
or "market-state" lines, but where private and corporative 
interests meet. Perhaps this very committee will set an example 
of civilized lobbying. 
  Now a few words about the composition of the Defense 
Committee. It has been reported that it is headed by Colonel 
Sergey Yushenkov ("Russia's Choice). His deputies are Nikolay 
Bezborodov (KPR [Communist Party of Russia]), Yevgeniy Loginov 
(LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]), and Aleksandr 
Piskunov (NRP). All three are servicemen. The committee 
includes four representatives of the NRP, three each from 
"Russia's Choice," the Communists, and the LDPR, and one each 
from "Women of Russia," the Democratic Party, and the Agrarians. 
  And the committee is not so large that it cannot be listed 
in 
full: Vladimir Volkov (history teacher from Orsk), Colonel 
General Dmitriy Volkogonov (defense and security adviser to the 
Russian Federation president), Andrey Generalov (president of 
the trade and industry chamber in Tutayevo), Marina 
Dobrovolskaya (chairman of the Union of Navy Women), Georgiy 
Lukava (head of department at the Moscow State Technical 
University of Civil Aviation), Aleksandr Mikhaylov (chief of the 
Russian Federation Agriculture Ministry Main Administration for 
Kolkhozes), Colonel General Yuriy Rodionov (Russian Federation 
deputy chief military inspector), Yevgeniy Fedorov (serviceman), 
Nikolay Fedorov (lawyer), Artur Chilingarov (president of the 
Association of Polar Expedition Members), Sergey Churkin 
(coordinator of the Vologda LDPR Oblast organization, and 
Anatoliy Yaroshenko (director of the "Bolsheurinskoye" 
joint-stock company, Bolshaya Urya, Krasnoyarsk Kray). 
  It is hard to say how efficient these Duma Defense Committee 
members will be and how quickly they will set up a legislative 
mechanism. One thing is clear, though: All members of the 
Defense Committee, and of the other committees, as a matter of 
fact, are simply doomed to cooperate. Communists and democrats, 
reserve sergeants and generals, the young and the experienced -- 
they have all committed themselves to providing laws for the 
serviceman's life and service and laws that will enable Russia 
to defend itself and its interests. So all we military people 
can do is wish the new committee normal, efficient work under 
the slogan: "Less politics and more laws."

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Sidorov: "Moscow Against Air Strikes on </F>
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] It is in Russia's interest for Serbia-Montenegro to 
be as strong as possible and for the problems involved in 
settling the conflict in the former Yugoslavia to be resolved 
peacefully. So said Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma 
International Affairs Committee, in conversation with 
journalists after the first parliamentary hearings, held at the 
end of last week, on a priority area of Russian foreign policy 
-- Yugoslavia. 
  V. Lukin made it clear that the West's stance on the former 
Yugoslavia does not conform in all respects with Russia's 
interests in the Balkan region. Sergey Lavrov, Russian 
Federation deputy minister of foreign affairs, made the same 
point when addressing deputies. He emphasized that Russia does 
not support the idea of air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
positions, as proposed by NATO, and has never ever advocated 
such methods for resolving the Yugoslav conflict. He reminded 
people that the UN resolutions permitting coercive measures 
against any side in the Yugoslav conflict contain tough 
restrictions. Such measures are possible in the event of an 
attack on humanitarian aid convoys, violations of the "closed 
skies" regime by the sides' military aircraft, or the creation 
of obstacles to the activities of the UN peacemaking forces. As 
the Russian diplomat pointed out, the NATO leadership's recent 
statements of readiness to make strikes against Serbian 
positions have not contributed to the process of negotiations on 
the former Yugoslavia. He reaffirmed the immutability of 
Russia's position on a Yugoslav settlement, which is aimed at a 
peaceful solution. 
  While rating the direction of the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
activities at present as "correct" on the whole, Chairman Lukin 
recalled that the Foreign Ministry had made a serious mistake by 
supporting sanctions against the former Yugoslavia last spring. 
In the opinion of a number of observers, the State Duma is 
faced with the need to make a clearer assessment of Russian 
interests in the former Yugoslavia and to elaborate, jointly 
with the Foreign Ministry, ways of acting that really can result 
in the unblocking of the Yugoslav conflict. The activation of 
Russia's policy in the Balkans is becoming increasingly urgent 
in view of the fact that the West's leadership has virtually led 
the peace process into an impasse. Moreover, there is a real 
danger that the military conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina will 
escalate to an all-Balkan scale. 
  The idea was voiced in the parliamentary lobby that the time 
has come for serious consultations both with Western partners 
and with the most influential Islamic states on the coordination 
of interests and the implementation of a more realistic policy 
in respect of the Balkans by a particular group of states. 
Obviously an alternative does exist to a very dangerous 
escalation of the conflict and to extremism in Bosnia. It lies 
in support for those Bosnian leaders, including Muslims, who 
enjoy the people's support and who have proved the sincerity of 
their desire for peace.

  [Text] Orel January 24 TASS--Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin visited several agricultural enterprises in the 
Orel region, central Russia, on Monday [24 January]. 
  Chernomyrdin is in Orel to attend an agricultural conference 
opening here on Tuesday. The conference will discuss measures 
to ensure fuller use of the agroindustrial complex in central 
Russia and better food supplies to the country as a whole. 
  The conference, which will be attended by the leaders of the 
federal bodies of power and administration heads of 18 central 
Russian regions and their deputies in charge of agriculture, is 
expected to hear the prime minister's first statement on 
agricultural policy after recent reshuffles in the government. 
Informed sources told ITAR-TASS that the conference is expected 
to result in a government resolution on working out a programme 
for the development of the agroindustrial complexes of the 
central Russian regions for the period up to the year 2000. 
  Today conference participants visited some agricultural 
enterprises in the Orel region and food-processing factories. 
They also had conversations with private farmers. 
  Cherrnomyrdin was accompanied in his trip by Vice-Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Central Bank chairman Viktor 
Gerashchenko and Orel regional administration head Yegor Stroyev.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Viktor Metchikov under the </F>
"Theme of the Day" rubric: "How to Feed the Country?"] 
  [Text] Orel--In Orel today, the government is holding a 
conference with the heads of administration of 17 oblasts in 
central Russia, their deputies responsible for agriculture, and 
agrarian scientists. Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the 
government, has arrived to take part in this conference. He is 
being accompanied on this working visit by Aleksandr Zaveryukha, 
a vice premier; Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central 
Bank of Russia Board; and Gennadiy Romanenko, president of the 
Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences. 
  Without anticipating speeches that have already been 
prepared 
but have yet to be delivered and a final document that has yet 
to be adopted, let us note that the conference bears a clearly 
marked "cardiological" character for Russia for two reasons. 
  First, no matter how the discussion turns out, the utmost 
attention will be paid to the foundation of the state's 
life--the agrarian sector. 
  Second, the 17 oblasts located in the river basins and on 
the 
watersheds of the Volga, the Don, the Oka, and the upper Dnieper 
do indeed form Russia's heartland. They account for only around 
4.8 percent of the country's territory, but in 1992, for 
example, they produced 30.5 percent of gross agricultural 
output. And, of course, the central region is suffering 
greatly, as is our whole state. 
  The difference of opinion over the definition of the main 
question on the agenda which preceded the conference--an 
unexpected fuss for an event at this level--was awkward, however. 
  V. Shuteyev, the head of the Kursk Oblast Administration, 
described his expectations on the eve of the trip in these terms: 
  "I want Viktor Stepanovich to confirm his recent promise to 
settle accounts with country people in January for last year's 
grain harvest." 
  I would like to note that even before that, during the 
election campaign for the Agrarian Party, Vice Premier A. 
Zaveryukha spoke in Kursk, where he gave the local agricultural 
aktiv a cast-iron guarantee that the oblast would receive the 
money for its grain in the next few days. There was a great 
rush after those words--the cash-starved leaders of rayons and 
farms really hammered on the doors of the oblast agricultural 
administration, fearful that they would be too late for the 
share-out. But so far there has been no sign of the grain 
payment--around 21 billion rubles. 
  The miserable transfer of payments between partners on 
Russia's territory and the lack of credit resources threaten to 
wreck the spring sowing campaign. There is no money for seed or 
spares, and 12,000 tonnes of fuel have been stockpiled in Kursk 
Oblast as against the 182,000 tonnes that are needed. Nor is it 
clear how the local budget is to provide advances or credit for 
the purchase of agricultural produce under the new scheme if the 
local budget does not include sources of finance for that 
purpose. Furthermore, the long-term questions of the region's 
development are foundering on the lack of resources. This is 
what worries V. Shuteyev. 
  Meanwhile Orel was prepared for a fundamentally different 
debate. In all the documents and studies prepared here the 
conference's main idea was formulated thus: "A State Program 
for the Revival of Central Russia." Ye. Stroyev, head of the 
Orel Oblast administration, puts the argument like this: 
  "We are categorically opposed to an analysis which deals 
with 
the present-day and relates to the agrarian sector alone. A 
narrow departmental approach will produce nothing but disaster 
again. What is needed is not a departmental or technocratic 
program, but a multisectoral state program that uses all the 
historically accumulated potential, both economic and cultural. 
  The oblast leaders' views hardly conflict with one another; 
some will focus attention on present-day problems, others on the 
need to take a long-term view. Without sowing our daily bread 
there will be no long-term progress. But unless we take a 
long-term view we will, figuratively speaking, sow the wrong 
thing in the wrong way. 
  I wonder what medicine will be prescribed in Orel for the 
agrarian sector and for the entire economy of Russia? Will it 
enable them to cease being a "black hole," swallowing up 
financial and other resources and giving nothing in return? 
  Much depends, clearly, on whether there is at last a sober 
and honest assessment of the present-day stage of the reforms. 
Will it be said clearly that what we actually have achieved in 
the countryside so far is progress of a psychological nature 
alone: We have accepted private ownership, but that is all. 
However, the reorganization of kolkhozes and sovkhozes has not 
actually turned the peasant into a landowner. 
  "The reforms have taken the path of the misappropriation of 
property by the leadership" -- it was Igor Chukhrayev, deputy 
chief of the Kursk Oblast Agricultural Administration, who let 
that phrase slip. We shall be hearing similar opinions 
increasingly often.

  [Text] Among other issues, the Russian and Chechen sides 
discussed the possibility of a meeting between Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev at the 
bilateral talks in Moscow last week, Chechen Prime Minister 
Mairbek Mugadayev [title as received] told a press conference in 
Groznyy today. 
  He said his two-hour meeting with Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin focused on a wide range of issues related to 
the concluding of a treaty on the principles for economic 
cooperation between Russia and the Chechen Republic. The 
Chechen official pointed out that "all the issues the Chechen 
delegation raised before the Russian prime minister were 
understood and approved. The two sides came to the conclusion 
that a political settlement and a meeting of the heads of state 
were needed for the resolution of all economic disputes." 
  "In turn, V.Chernomyrdin hoped that such a meeting could be 
held in the near future," Mugadayev said. 
  The Chechen prime minister said the meeting touched on the 
possibility of freeing the former speaker of the Russian Supreme 
Soviet, Chechen citizen Ruslan Khasbulatov accused of organizing 
the armed uprising in Moscow in early October.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev by </F>
Radik Batyrshin in Kazan under the "Tatarstan" rubric: "We Will 
Come to a Democratic Federation, President Mintimer Shaymiyev 
Believes"; date not given] 
  [Text] On 21 January a meeting of the presidents of Russia 
and Tatarstan took place. Upon returning to Kazan, Mintimer 
Shaymiyev gave an exclusive interview to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. 
  [Batyrshin] What can be considered the meeting's main 
result? 
  [Shaymiyev] We agreed to speed up the negotiating process as 
much as possible, because on 13 March new elections to the 
Federal Assembly will take place in Tatarstan. We believe that 
Tatarstan should be represented in the Federal Assembly. But in 
order for the population to turn out actively for the elections, 
we need to sign a bilateral treaty. Without determining a 
formula of our relationship, however, expecting the voters to be 
active would be simply naive. 
  [Batyrshin] Does the Russian president object in principle 
regarding the bilateral treaty's text? 
  [Shaymiyev] The work on the treaty is still going on, which 
is why we did not consider separate articles of the document, 
and we agreed that the final version of the text would be 
considered no later than by the first third of February. 
  [Batyrshin] What problems exist today in the negotiating 
process between Moscow and Kazan? 
  [Shaymiyev] There are no big problems in the work on the 
treaty text. The main, albeit entirely surmountable, 
difficulties have emerged in the process of preparing five 
intergovernmental agreements -- on banking activity, the budget, 
the coordination of the law-enforcement agencies' efforts, on 
defense matters, and on foreign economic activity. The treaty 
will not be concluded without these agreements. I think that 
within 10 days we will be able to complete the work on these 
agreements and get around to concluding the treaty. 
  [Batyrshin] Does this mean that Moscow currently recognizes 
Tatarstan's status as "a sovereign state, a subject of 
international law, associated with the Russian Federation on the 
basis of the Treaty between the State Authorities of the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan on the Mutual 
Delegation of Powers and Terms of Reference" (a phrasing from 
the Tatarstan Constitution)? 
  [Shaymiyev] We are trying to arrive at a formula of a 
relationship within the framework of the two constitutions that 
would be a fruit of a compromise. 
  [Batyrshin] Could you, please, expand on that? 
  [Shaymiyev] No, because presently the working groups under 
Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev and Russian 
Federation Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov are working on it 
every day, from early morning till midnight. The definitive 
consideration within the dates I have mentioned will bring about 
complete clarity. 
  [Batyrshin] Do the agreements call for the law-enforcement 
agencies to be brought under Tatarstan jurisdiction or the other 
way around? 
  [Shaymiyev] There will be subjects of joint jurisdiction and 
subjects under Tatarstan jurisdiction. As the consultations 
have shown, we can easily reach agreement. As with regard to 
other problems, the republic's independence does not rule out 
coordination in our work. Presently, a major part of the 
republic's law- enforcement agencies is under Tatarstan's 
jurisdiction, but this does not hamper collaboration with the 
federal authorities. Or why should we have the Internal Affairs 
Ministry's army units performing federal missions in our 
subordination? 
  [Batyrshin] Is Moscow going to accept a one-channel taxation 
system that has long been favored by Kazan? 
  [Shaymiyev] Tax relations involve politics, too. For 
Tatarstan citizens have Russian Federation citizenship and must 
feel through taxes that they belong to Russia. Earlier, we did 
not take this matter into account; it is impeccable in legal 
terms. It is another matter that there are many questions 
related to the financing of our specific programs, the more so 
because our republic does not belong to those that receive 
subsidies. 
  [Batyrshin] The latest full-scale negotiations between 
Russia and Tatarstan took place last May. At the time, you were 
certain that the treaty would be signed by August at the latest. 
Aren't you afraid that presently the period of accelerated work 
on the treaty will be followed by nine months of stagnation? 
  [Shaymiyev] No, because I do not think that Russia is in for 
last year's upheavals. The sociopolitical situation inside the 
country is currently favorable for concluding the treaty. In 
addition, the president and the Russian Government are 
decisively intent on launching a new regional policy. 
Decentralization is inevitable. It has been two years since 
they have refused to give Tatarstan powers, but we took them on 
our own. Is Tatarstan worse off because of that or not? No one 
can deny that the situation inside the republic has improved. 
So, what do we have to be afraid of? I am convinced that 
Tatarstan's stance paves a way toward the Russian Federation's 
democratization. We will come to a democratic federation, even 
now, when many politicians think that Russia is a unitary state.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva January 25 TASS -- Will nuclear weapons 
testing grounds be finally closed? The solution of this 
problem, on which politicians, military leaders and diplomats 
have been racking their brains for several past decades, may be 
brought closer by the annual session of the U.N. disarmament 
conference, which opened here today. 
  Having completed in 1992 the elaboration of a convention to 
ban chemical weapons, it is now getting down to the discussion 
of the problem of an all-embracing ban on nuclear tests. The 
session is being attended by delegations from 37 states-members 
of the conference, including Russia. 
  "The banning of tests is a very important measure, primarily 
from the viewpoint of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons", 
Grigoriy Berdennikov, Russia's permanent representative, told 
ITAR-TASS. "It is not a matter of concluding a treaty among the 
nuclear powers alone, but a matter of complete and universal 
prohibition of tests in all the countries of the world. This 
will guarantee us against the emergence of a new possessor of 
nuclear weapons." 
  The Geneva session is particularly important in light of 
current preparations for a conference of signatories of the 
nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, scheduled for 1995. 
This conference may adopt a decision to prolong the treaty 
forever. 
  "The idea of fully banning nuclear tests was advanced by 
Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954. We have traditionally backed this 
initiative," Berdennikov added. "The treaty to ban tests in 
three media was concluded in 1963. We have also signed a treaty 
with the Americans to restrict the yield of nuclear tests. We 
are observing a moratorium on tests for several years now. 
Everybody admits that it has created a good background for 
talks in Geneva." 
  "The main problem after the end of the 'Cold War' is to save 
the world from the 'spreading' of mass destruction weapons and 
means for their delivery," the Russian representative said. "It 
is very important to reach agreement on security guarantees to 
non-nuclear state and on stopping the output of fissionable 
materials. The current session of the conference will also 
focus its attention on these problems."

<F P=106> [Remarks by Ambassador Vaeino Reinart, head of the Division </F>
for International Organizations and Security Policy, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Estonia, and head of 
Delegation for Negotiations with Russia, at the Council of 
Europe 506th meeting of the ministers' deputies called for an 
exchange of views on the United Nations; in Strasbourg on 20 
January; received via Internet] 
  [Text] Madame Chair, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  It is a great honour to address this distinguished audience 
today. It is difficult to overestimate the importance of the 
Council of Europe [CE] in safeguarding human rights and 
promoting co-operation among relevant organizations such as the 
United Nations and the CSCE. Because the purpose of our meeting 
today is to exchange views on the conclusions reached by the 
United Nations 48th General Assembly Third Committee, and 
because I represent the only Council of Europe member state to 
have gone before that committee recently, specifically with 
regard to human rights, I feel compelled to draw your attention 
to a few relevant points. 
  We consider the results of the 48th General Assembly to be 
of 
utmost importance both with regard to the human rights issue and 
for the further development of mechanisms intended to ensure 
compliance in this area. First, let me stress the importance of 
the newly-established office of the High Commissioner on Human 
Rights, who will enjoy the status of a UN Undersecretary 
General, a post whose creation was adopted by consensus of the 
184 UN member states. However useful this post will be, recent 
developments regarding the use of human rights mechanisms have 
demonstrated to us that there can never be enough mechanisms to 
provide each country with the findings it may need to explain 
its policies to the satisfaction of others. 
  I would add one caveat here, and that is that we do, indeed, 
face challenges in integrating our alien population into 
Estonian society. For instance, we have a scarcity of language 
teachers and instructional materials. However, I would stress 
that these difficulties of integration are organizational 
matters that bear no relation to human rights. 
  To confuse these practical matters with the very serious 
matter of human rights would be irresponsible. 
  My second point, regarding organizational politics, is no 
less significant. I have in mind a serious case of abuse of the 
existing UN human rights mechanisms which, unfortunately for all 
of us here, appears to have set a precedent. As we are all 
aware, despite a lack of findings by the Special Mission of the 
UN to Estonia and regardless of the positive report of the 
Secretary General in this matter, the UNGA [United Nations 
General Assembly] recently adopted a resolution on the situation 
of human rights in my country. I was pleased to read the 
Secretariat Memorandum, prepared by the Directorate of Human 
Rights and submitted to the distinguished participants of this 
meeting, which deals with the UNGA resolution. To refresh your 
memory, the Secretariat Memorandum stated that, and I quote, 
"the brevity and wording of the text may indicate that this 
question will no longer appear on the Assembly's agenda," end of 
quote. 
  I would be delighted to share the Secretariat's optimism in 
this matter. However, because the Memorandum only suggests that 
the resolution's wording "may indicate" a certain result, I am 
reluctant to do so. 
  Our delegation to the 48th UNGA did its best to negotiate 
an acceptable wording, and we found it curious that we received 
no support in our efforts. This leads me to the conclusion that 
the Council of Europe member states represented here today 
harbor doubts as to whether the reports of the UN and the 
Council of Europe missions to investigate the human rights 
situation in Estonia are, in fact, credible and objective 
documents. 
  As you know, in the end we accepted the UNGA resolution 
proposed by the delegation from the Russian Federation and we 
conceded to the language because we understand that, for 
domestic political reasons, Russia requires any such UN document 
to establish the basis for possible future accusations. At the 
same time, we know better than most that Russia's internal 
political situation will not, in the foreseeable future, become 
so stable that these unfounded accusations will stop. This is 
especially clear after President Boris Yeltsin's New Year's 
greeting to the Russian people, in which Mr. Yeltsin described 
the defense of the rights of Russians living outside the 
Russian Federation as being among his state's highest foreign 
policy priorities. 
  In addition, Yeltsin's remarks last week at the US-Russian 
summit, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's comments last 
Monday, strongly suggest that the tone of these accusations in 
the area of human rights is likely to become more, not less, 
strident, and that their frequency will increase. I am 
confident that you share our view that these accusations are 
purely political in nature. In light of these developments, I 
would ask you to consider whether we can allow for the 
usurpation of this vital tool, that is, human rights 
mechanisms, to indulge an individual state's political interests? 
  I would now turn to another problem, namely, the scarcity of 
financial and human resources in the human rights field. 
Estonia believes that the international community is in danger 
of squandering those possibilities open to us. For instance, a 
fact-finding mission of the UN that visited Estonia a year ago 
reported no evidence of discrimination on ethnic or religious 
grounds in Estonia. Unfortunately, however, the Resolution of 
the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly on the human rights 
situation in Latvia and Estonia did not address that report. 
Are we so wealthy that we can justify dispatching costly 
missions whose labours are not used? I think not. 
  My final point touches upon the reputation of the Council of 
Europe as a whole, about which my country is concerned. It 
seems to Estonia that the quiet acceptance by Council of Europe 
member states of these well-orchestrated and unfounded 
accusations against a fellow Council member-state by a 
non-Council member calls into question the credibility of the 
Council of Europe as a whole. I ask you, does this quiet 
acceptance not undermine the very authority of the Council of 
Europe to speak with one voice in matters of human rights? 
  I would remind you that in ten days' time, the UN Commission 
on Human Rights will meet in Geneva to discuss human rights 
issues. Because Estonia is not a member of that Commission, we 
are put in the difficult position of not being able to defend 
ourselves against the next round of accusations which are sure 
to be raised at the forum. 
  Dear colleagues, if you share Estonia's concern about the 
reputation of the Council of Europe, I appeal to those of you 
represented on the UN Commission on Human Rights to stand up 
against any resolutions based on unfounded accusations that may 
be tabled against Estonia at the Geneva meeting. 
  I would conclude by saying that Estonia fondly cherishes the 
hope that the human rights area will not suffer from an illness 
that all too frequently afflicted the social sciences during the 
Soviet period, namely, that if the facts do not verify the 
theory, then it is too bad for the facts. 
  I thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Russian-Chinese Talks in Beijing"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev arrives in Beijing Wednesday on a four-day official 
visit. This trip, which is regarded here as an important event 
in rapidly progressing Chinese-Russian relations, is being made 
in line with the accords reached during Russian Federation 
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to the PRC in December 1992. 
  The head of Russia's foreign policy department will hold 
talks with his Chinese counterpartue Qian Qichen and will meet 
with Jiang Z emin, president of the PRC and general secretary of 
the CPC Central Committee, and with Li Peng, premier of the PRC 
State Council. One of the main topics to be discussed by the 
sides is the preparation of the second top-level Russian-Chinese 
meeting, this time in Moscow. 
  The sides will examine regional and international problems 
of 
interest to Russia and China as permanent members of the UN 
Security Council. It is believed here that the situation in 
Northeast Asia, where the nuclear problem of the Korean 
Peninsula is most acute, also will not be overlooked. 
  Key aspects of bilateral relations -- trade-economic and 
military-technical cooperation and border questions -- will be 
touched on during the talks between Andrey Kozyrev and Qian 
Qichen, which are being held within the framework of regular 
consultations between the two countries' Foreign Ministries. 
  The talks are expected to result in the signing of an 
intergovernmental agreement on crossing points on the 
Russian-Chinese border and also a protocol on consultations 
between the Russian Federation and PRC Foreign Ministries. 
  The Russian minister will address Chinese political experts 
at the Institute of People's Diplomacy in Beijing and will visit 
the Shenzhen special economic zone in the south of the country, 
which is an experimental base in implementing reform and a 
policy of openness. He will also visit the ancient capital of 
the Middle State -- the city of Xian, the cradle of Chinese 
civilization.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station observer Krichevskiy from the </F>
"Current Events and Commentary" program -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev will pay an 
official visit to China from 26 to 29 January. Station observer 
Krichevskiy has the following commentary on this issue: 
  In addition to the length of his visit to this neighboring 
country, we also know the scope of the issues that the Russian 
foreign minister will discuss while visiting Beijing. 
  First of all, these issues are relevant to the preparations 
for the second Russian-Chinese summit. Because Yeltsin visited 
China before the winter of last year, it is now Jiang Zemin's 
turn to visit Russia. The Russian-Chinese summit will settle 
several issues relevant to strengthening the two countries' 
bilateral ties and their partnership in the international arena. 
Kozyrev's visit (?will be) conducive to this matter. He plans 
to discuss with Chinese leaders the possibilities of and 
prospects for developing economic cooperation and trade and 
scientific-technological cooperation, as well the border issue. 
  For example, the two sides will sign an accord on 
establishing border checkpoints [words indistinct] improve the 
situation along Russian-Chinese border. The establishment of 
checkpoints will also help prevent trouble from arising from the 
border trade carried out in areas between adjacent Russian 
oblasts and Chinese provinces. As far as economic ties and 
trade are concerned, (?both sides) have expressed their 
dissatisfaction with their current state. Nobody doubts that 
these ties will expand and will become more successful in the 
future, even though China's trade volume with Russia already 
puts it in second place in this category. 
  In the area of economic cooperation, there is an 
increasingly 
pressing need for Russia to study the experiences that China has 
gained in carrying out economic reform. We should know why 
China's economic development has been gathering speed -- speed 
which reached approximately 13 percent last year -- as a result 
of its reform, whereas in Russia the rapidity has been 
decreasing each year. The discussion of this question cannot be 
avoided during Kozyrev's visit. China's experiences in building 
special economic zones undoubtedly have been successful. 
  Incidentally, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev and his 
experts and advisers also have plan to visit the Shenzhen 
Special Economic Zone, while their talks in the Chinese capital 
will deal with international issues. 
  Russia and China are the two biggest countries in the Asia- 
Pacific region. To a great extent, the relaxation of regional 
conflicts and [word indistinct] development in economic 
relations and trade in this region depend on Russia and China. 
Moreover, the deepening of the Russian-Chinese partnership in 
all fields, including the deepening of cooperation in military 
technology, is not directed at any third country in any way. In 
fact, the more solid that Russian-Chinese relations become, the 
more stable the situation in the Asia-Pacific region will be. 
On the contrary, if Russian-Chinese relations do deteriorate in 
any way, this deterioration will have unfavorable effects on the 
overall situation in the Asia-Pacific region.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Kozyrev Rejects Zhirinovskiy's </F>
Ultimatum. Conflict Building Up Between Foreign Ministry and 
Duma"] 
  [Text] Andrey Kozyrev has rejected Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's 
ultimatum and does not intend to take a pro-Serb stance in the 
Bosnian conflict. The minister made this statement in an 
interview with the INTERFAX agency a few minutes before his 
flight from Moscow to Bishkek. Last Friday [21 January] the 
leader of the liberal democrats threatened Kozyrev with 
dismissal unless he changed his policy on the Balkans within a 
week and put himself unconditionally on the Serbs' side. 
  According to Kozyrev, by making such demands, Zhirinovskiy 
is 
pushing Moscow toward a world war. "Certain political forces," 
the minister said, "are trying to drag Russia into a global 
catastrophe, and use this to their own advantage, to seize 
power.... If Zhirinovskiy or anyone else demands my 
resignation, I will perceive this as the best admission that my 
policy is correct." 
  A conflict between the Duma and the Foreign Ministry looks 
inevitable. More than likely, as early as next week -- having 
completed his trips to Yugoslavia and Poland -- Zhirinovskiy 
will put his threat into practice and demand a vote of no 
confidence in Kozyrev. The majority of factions in the Duma 
will scarcely be able to resist the temptation to settle scores 
with the minister, who has always been an object of hatred for 
the nationalists and Communists and, following Gaydar's 
departure, will probably become the main target of their 
criticism. The "anti-Kozyrev lobby" in the lower chamber of 
parliament is very influential, uniting representatives of the 
most diverse political forces -- from the liberal democrats to 
Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs Committee 
and until recently Russian ambassador in Washington, whose 
strained relations with his former boss are no secret to anyone. 
  Two-thirds of Duma members may vote no confidence in 
Kozyrev, 
which, admittedly, does not commit either the minister himself, 
or President Yeltsin, to anything. In the recent past, the 
Russian leader ignored the majority of foreign policy 
resolutions adopted by the Congress and the Supreme Soviet. Is 
Yeltsin likely to start heeding the opinion of the Duma which, 
under the new Constitution, has considerably less power than 
Khasbulatov's parliament? 
  Especially since, once they discard any liberal-democrat 
demagoguery, the deputies will hardly be able to clearly define 
the turnabout they expect from Russia's diplomacy. Since the 
middle of last year, the Foreign Ministry can hardly be blamed 
for any lack of pro-Serb sympathies: Russia was among the first 
to call for an easing of sanctions against Belgrade and, just 
like before, is against any strikes by NATO aviation against 
Bosnian Serb positions. 
  Even if we were to agree with the highly dubious thesis that 
our foreign policy's priority must be to uphold Serb interests, 
it must be admitted that Kozyrev has not given all that many 
causes for criticism in the recent past. Provided, of course, 
that one does not take the positions of Zhirinovskiy who is 
calling for Russian divisions to be sent to the Balkans and is 
prepared to confront the entire world for the sake of the 
"Serbian brothers."

Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Jan -- The Russian side is concerned 
about the mass violations by Japanese fishing vessels of Russian 
territorial waters near the island of Kunashir which could 
complicate relations between Russia and Japan, Mikhail Demurin, 
the deputy director of the Press and Information Department of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing today. 
  He said that on 21 January over 50 Japanese boats 
demonstratively entered Russian territorial waters and remained 
there for over five hours against the demands of border guards 
that they leave. The next day 30 Japanese boats again violated 
Russian waters. 
  The Russian foreign policy department spokesman said that 
the 
Russian Foreign Ministry made a representation regarding this to 
the Japanese embassy in Moscow. It voiced deep concern over the 
violations and demanded that the Japanese side take effective 
measures to prevent them. 
  "Our concern is all the more serious because the violations 
are taking place on the eve of bilateral consultations at deputy 
foreign minister level and also on the eve of the sitting of the 
peace treaty working group," Mikhail Demurin stressed.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 26 Jan -- A protocol on trade and 
economic cooperation between Mongolia and Russia for 1994 was 
initialed here today. As last year, Russia remains Mongolia's 
principal trading partner. Areas of cooperation include 
Mongolia's leading industries -- mining, power engineering, 
geology, agriculture, and transport. Both sides expressed their 
intention to increase two-way trade, which was worth about $400 
million last year. 
  Mongolia will significantly increase deliveries of copper 
concentrate, currently its main export commodity. The Russian 
side will also receive fluorspar and articles made from leather 
and fur. Exports of meat will resume after having been 
interrupted for a while. 
  Mongolia will import a greater range of goods from Russia. 
Russia will supply Mongolia with all its requirements for 
petroleum products. Imports of agricultural machinery and 
vehicle spares will actually resume. Cooperation in health care 
and medicine is also resuming. 
  Agreements on the establishment of joint ventures in mining, 
oil exploration and extraction, and construction work on 
projects built in Mongolia with technical and economic help from 
the former Soviet Union also testify to stabilization and 
progress in the development of bilateral cooperation. Amongst 
other things, the Russian side will help to modernize the 
capital's heat and power plant No. 3 and a junction on the 
Trans-Mongolian railway. 
  Another new feature of the current stage of 
Mongolian-Russian 
cooperation is the fact that neighboring regions of Russia -- 
Buryatia, Irkutsk, and Chita oblasts, Tuva, Krasnoyarsk Kray and 
others -- are being actively brought into it. 
  Another noteworthy aspect of the equitable and mutually 
advantageous cooperation between the two neighbouring states is 
noticeably greater involvement of commercial organizations in 
foreign trade. Their share accounts for roughly 40 percent of 
total trade. 
  The sides agreed that this year Mongolia would continue 
repaying its current debt to Russia.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Melnik for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev, 25 Jan -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
has asked the republic's Supreme Council to reexamine its 
decision on the ratification of the START I Treaty and the 
Lisbon (March 1992) Protocol to it. As is known, the decision 
adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Council on 18 November 1993 
states that the republic does not regard it as obligatory for it 
to accede to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons. 
  The document containing Leonid Kravchuk's proposal was 
distributed to Supreme Council members to look at today. 
  In the note accompanying the draft parliamentary decision, 
Leonid Kravchuk notes that the accords reached in Moscow on 14 
January between the presidents of Russia, the United States, and 
Ukraine provide guarantees for the national security of Ukraine, 
pledges by the United States to grant Ukraine a minimum of 175 
million dollars for the dismantling of the nuclear weapons, with 
the possibility that this amount may be increased, and also the 
removal of all nuclear charges from Ukraine to Russia for 
dismantling with the simultaneous provision of compensation to 
the republic in the form of removed and processed nuclear fuel 
for nuclear power engineering. Further, the Ukrainian 
president's note states that the United States has declared its 
readiness to help Ukraine to develop a market economy. 
  The Ukrainian Supreme Council plans to examine the question 
of the trilateral Moscow Statement of the presidents of Ukraine, 
the United States, and Russia this week.

  [Text] Kiev, 25 Jan -- A letter, dated 24 January 1994, 
from the president of Ukraine to Ukrainian deputies and Ivan 
Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, numbered 
1-14/23 and concerning the Moscow statement, was distributed to 
people's deputies of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. In 
particular the letter says: 
  "In connection with the recommendation by the Supreme 
Council 
of Ukraine contained in point 11 of the resolution of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 November 1993, I am informing 
the Supreme Council about the steps taken by myself and the 
government of Ukraine. Talks in a bilateral and trilateral 
format with the Russian Federation and the United States of 
America were initiated by us to implement the Supreme Council 
resolution. As a result of intense talks in Kiev, Washington, 
and Moscow, a trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, 
the United States, and Russia was elaborated, which was signed 
in Moscow on 14 January of this year. The text of the statement 
and the appendix to it contain clauses going in the direction of 
implementing the issues noted in the resolution. In particular 
the accords reached in Moscow envisage granting Ukraine 
guarantees of its national security after the START I Treaty 
comes into force and Ukraine accedes to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. They contain pledges regarding 
confirming independence, sovereignty, and existing borders and 
refraining from threats of force or using force or measures of 
economic pressure; a pledge by the United States to grant 
Ukraine a minimum of $170 million for the dismantlement of 
nuclear weapons with the possibility of the size of this 
assistance being increased; moving all nuclear warheads in 
Ukraine to Russia for their dismantlement with simultaneous 
compensation being granted in the form of deliveries of fuel 
assemblies to Ukraine for the needs of its nuclear power 
engineering. 
  "In addition, and this is of especial political 
significance, 
it was confirmed that Ukraine, the United States, and Russia 
will cooperate with each other as fully fledged and equal 
partners and that relations between them should be developed on 
the principles of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity of every state. 
  "The United States also stated its readiness to render 
assistance to Ukraine in creating a market economy in Ukraine. 
In this way, the trilateral statement and the appendix to it, 
and also their implementation, meet the demands set forth in the 
resolution of the Supreme Council of 18 November 1993. In 
connection with this, in accordance with an article of the 
constitution of Ukraine, by way of a legislative initiative I am 
submitting proposals to remove the reservations contained in the 
resolution of the Supreme Council of 18 November 1993 concerning 
article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol and Ukraine's accession to the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A draft of a corresponding 
resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine is appended." 
  Appended to the document is the Supreme Council's draft 
resolution on this issue of the following contents: 
  "The Supreme Council's resolution on the implementation by 
the Ukrainian president and the Ukrainian Government of 
recommendations contained in Paragraph 11 of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council's resolution on the ratification of the Treaty 
between the USSR and the U.S. on the Reduction and Limitation of 
Strategic Nuclear Offensive Weapons, signed in Moscow on 31 July 
1991, and the protocol to it, signed in Lisbon on behalf of 
Ukraine on 23 May 1992; 
  "Taking account of the specific steps that were taken by the 
Ukrainian president and government in the period from November 
1993 to January 1994, in respect of the implementation of the 
provisions of the Supreme Council's resolution of 18 November 
1993; 
  "Proceeding from the results of the meeting between the 
Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian Federation presidents in Moscow on 
14 January 1994 and the trilateral statement and appendix to it, 
signed by them; 
  "Taking account of the fact that it was confirmed to Ukraine 
by the U.S. and Russian presidents that they were ready to 
extend to Ukraine national security guarantees after the START I 
treaty is brought into effect and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty is acceded to by Ukraine as a nuclear-free state; 
  "As well as taking account of the obligations by the United 
States, Russia, and Great Britain relating to Ukraine, to 
respect its independence, sovereignty and existing borders, 
refrain from the threat or use of force against its territorial 
integrity or political independence, as well as refraining from 
economic pressure, and taking account of their obligation not to 
use any weapons against Ukraine; 
  "In view of the confirmation from the Ukrainian, American, 
and Russian presidents that they will build their relations on 
the basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity of each of the states, as well as the 
confirmation of their readiness to assist Ukraine in setting up 
an effective market economy; and 
  "Acknowledging the fact that the United States assured 
Ukraine of providing technical and financial assistance to 
dismantle nuclear weapons securely and safely and preserve 
fissionable material, as well as of promoting the speedy 
implementation of the agreements on this assistance, that are 
already in existence, the Supreme Council of Ukraine resolves: 
  "1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the 
president and Government of Ukraine regarding implementation of 
the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 18 November 
1993 and the steps on the part of the United States and Russia 
to meet Ukraine half way, to remove the reservations regarding 
Article 5 of the Protocol to the START I Treaty signed in Lisbon 
on 23 May 1992. 
  "2. To charge the Government of Ukraine to exchange 
instruments of ratification of the START I Treaty. 
  "3. To accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of 1 
July 1968, which will henceforth be called the Treaty, as a 
state not owning nuclear weapons, with the following statement: 
  "1) Ukraine owns the components of the nuclear weapons that 
it inherited from the former USSR. After the weapons are 
dismantled and destroyed under its control and in accordance 
with a procedure that will rule out the possibility of reusing 
these weapons' components for the original purpose, Ukraine 
intends to use the material extracted from them exclusively for 
civilian purposes, as fuel for Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric 
power station]'s in particular, or receive compensation for them; 
  "2) The Treaty does not fully cover the unique situation 
that 
arose as a result of the disintegration of nuclear power of the 
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The presence of nuclear 
weapons on the territory of Ukraine until they are eliminated 
entirely, as well as appropriate activity to maintain, service, 
and eliminate them, does not contravene Articles 1 and 2 of the 
Treaty. 
  "3) Ukraine will hold talks with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency with the aim of concluding agreements regarding 
the guarantees envisaged by the Treaty; 
  "4) The violation of the territorial integrity or 
inviolability of Ukraine's borders on the part of any nuclear 
state will be viewed by Ukraine as a violation of the Treaty."

<F P=106> [Report by Larisa Zhalovaga: "I Am Sure the Tripartite </F>
Agreement Serves Ukrainian Interests"] 
  [Text] Speaking at a meeting devoted to the recent 
scientific conference held in Jamaica and titled "Russia, 
Ukraine, the Caucasus, and the U.S. Policy," Ukrainian Foreign 
Deputy Minister Borys Tarasyuk said that sentiments in the U.S. 
scientific circles, which have a substantial influence on 
American lawmakers, have recently changed in favor of Ukraine. 
In the opinion of Mr. Tarasyuk, Ukraine is regarded as a 
serious factor in the geopolitical situation. The journalists 
wanted to learn certain aspects of the tripartite agreement 
regarding the liquidation of Ukrainian nuclear weapons recently 
signed in Moscow by the three presidents. 
  Asked whether the agreement will be implemented if the 
Supreme Council blocks joining the Lisbon Protocol, Borys 
Tarasyuk said: Of course, as a legislative body, the Supreme 
Council wields powers ensured by the Constitution, and its 
position on the Lisbon Protocol is known. However, one cannot 
deny the fact that the executive branch has a somewhat different 
viewpoint. As you know, the Ukrainian president has repeatedly 
stressed his disagreement with the Supreme Council decision made 
on 18 November, and again will try to persuade the deputies that 
Ukraine must join the nonproliferation treaty. Will the 
agreement be implemented? 
  We know how the world reacted to the ratification of START I 
by our legislature. Some participants of the tripartite 
agreement soundly rejected the position and all conditions put 
forward in the Supreme Council resolution. As a result, the 
fact of signing the tripartite agreement proves that our 
partners recognized the correctness of the conditions declared 
by our parliament on 18 November, 1993. 
  Let us examine the most important ones. National security 
guarantees are reflected in the agreement. So is compensation 
for nuclear weapons and financial aid. A question may arise 
here: Are these sufficient guarantees? But this is a different 
issue, and it will be worked on. I am confident, however, that 
implementation of this agreement serves the interests of Ukraine. 
  Asked how the Crimean elections will influence 
Russian-Ukrainian relations, the foreign deputy minister cited a 
statement by a high-ranking Russian diplomat reported by 
INTERFAX, who thinks that the issue of the presidency in the 
Crimea is not completely settled with the Ukrainian parliament. 
Legally, the Ukrainian president can declare the elections 
void. The unidentified diplomat believes that no serious 
political crisis should be expected in case Yuriy Meshkov is 
elected Crimean president. Russian should only develop mutually 
advantageous relations with the Crimea, but on no account, as he 
put it, get it to eat out of Russia's hand. Politically, this 
would not be a good move regarding Ukraine. Besides, Russia 
does not need any spongers. This is the viewpoint of a ranking 
Russian diplomat, stressed Borys Tarasyuk. He also said that 
since this is our internal affair, the Crimean elections should 
cause concern to Ukraine rather than to Russia. 
  If the presidential elections in the peninsula do not change 
the present norms of international law and the Helsinki 
principles, improving instead its social and economic life, they 
should only be welcomed. 
  But if those elections result in attempts to change Crimea's 
status as part of Ukrainian territory, this will certainly 
produce very serious consequences in the domestic situation and, 
depending on Russia's reaction, on Ukrainian-Russian relations. 
  At the same time, Borys Tarasyuk emphasized, signatures of 
the three presidents on the tripartite agreement that speak 
about territorial integrity -- especially as it applies to 
Ukraine -- and the nonviolability of the present border point to 
the explicit position of the Russian leadership on possible 
attempts to split the Crimea from Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Kostenko, environment minister and </F>
head of a parliamentary working group on START I and nuclear 
disarmament, by Vladimir Skachko; place and date not given: 
"`This Is Not Disarmament but Disrobing [razdevaniye] of the 
State.' The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet Can Give a Legal 
Assessment of the Moscow Statement by the Three Presidents"] 
  [Text] Ivan Plyushch, speaker of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet, has stated that the Supreme Soviet must decide on the 
question of compatibility of Ukraine's national interests with 
the statement signed by presidents of the United States, 
Ukraine, and Russia on the future of the Ukrainian strategic 
missiles and also consider a draft resolution on Ukraine's 
accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. According to 
Ivan Plyushch, because the resolution on joining the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty was prepared by the presidential 
services, the report on this matter should be made by President 
Leonid Kravchuk. Yuriy Kostenko, head of a special working 
deputies group on preparing the START I Treaty and on Ukraine's 
acquiring a nonnuclear status, and minister for environmental 
protection, commented for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the deputies' 
decision to return to these matters. 
  [Kostenko] The Moscow tripartite statement has actually 
offered quite a different scheme of nuclear disarmament for 
Ukraine than what was decided on this score by our Supreme 
Soviet. This scheme does not take many aspects into account 
either from the viewpoint of national security or from the 
viewpoint of our economic interests. Therefore the Moscow 
statement must be considered in full as a separate agreement and 
be given an appropriate legal assessment. 
  [Skachko] But this is a statement, not an agreement. The 
parliament may neither ratify it, nor fail to ratify it. 
  [Kostenko] I understand this. The statement has been made 
in such a way that it could not be submitted to the 
consideration of the Supreme Soviet. This is so-called legal 
chicanery. Now, Ukraine's supreme legislative body adopts one 
scheme of nuclear disarmament while the executive branch, 
contrary to this, proposes a totally different one. Therefore 
the Supreme Soviet, in line with the current constitution and 
entitled to consider all international agreements, is also to 
consider this document as well as give it a proper legal 
appraisal and establish whether it is good for Ukraine. 
Possibly, it will have to be vetoed as a document which 
contradicts Ukraine's national interests. 
  [Skachko] And presumably the parliament resolution on this 
question must be enforced? 
  [Kostenko] This is undoubtedly the power of the Supreme 
Soviet. Moreover, I would like to point out that the work 
conducted by the Supreme Soviet will allow, in my opinion, more 
or less to balance Ukraine's interests with the interests of 
those who insist that Ukraine become nuclear-free. In the 
Moscow document I do not see either the economic interests or 
guarantees of Ukraine's security that many are talking about so 
much. 
  [Skachko] How would you comment on the view that neither the 
statement nor the appendix to it contains a word on compensation 
for the tactical nuclear weapons evacuated to Russia? 
  [Kostenko] This only shows once again that there is a 
certain contradiction between what our Supreme Soviet has 
adopted and what our president has signed. The parliament 
resolution clearly says that compensation must be made also for 
the tactical nuclear weapons, while the Moscow statement does 
not say anything about this separately. As far as I know, 
Russia apparently promises to consider this issue and provide 
some compensation after all. 
  [Skachko] In other words, compensation for tactical 
nuclear weapons is a subject of separate talks between Ukraine 
and Russia? 
  [Kostenko] Yes, talks on this issue have been going on, but 
it has not been settled conclusively yet because experts have 
been tasked to consider it and establish how exactly 
compensation will be made. 
  [Skachko] Has any time frame been defined for making 
compensation to Ukraine for the tactical nuclear weapons? 
  [Kostenko] No, no term has been established. This is very 
difficult to do because no one knows with what funds 
compensation will be made. If from the proceeds of the 500 
tonnes of enriched uranium that Russia is to sell to the United 
States, then this can happen only after this uranium has been 
sold on the world market. Only then will Russia start partially 
to receive real money and, naturally, will be able to make some 
compensation to Ukraine. At present, however, no such funds are 
available. True, there is also another option (which, 
incidentally, would be the most adequate for Ukraine): to 
evaluate the cost of each warhead. This is possible because it 
is known how much uranium and plutonium there is in each 
warhead. Therefore, using an equivalent, one could estimate the 
value of the tactical nuclear weapons that we have transferred 
to Russia. According to our preliminary estimates, the value is 
$10 billion. Assuming this sum, Russia is already in debt to 
Ukraine -- not the other way around, as some are trying to have 
us believe today. And if we talk about energy, then, given that 
uranium and plutonium are very valuable energy carriers, an 
equivalent exchange scheme could be used: We deliver highly 
enriched uranium and plutonium to them, and they supply us with 
oil and gas. But unfortunately this option has not been used; 
moreover, during the talks the subject of "plutonium" was 
somehow lost altogether. And it is a very costly element: one 
kilogram of enriched plutonium, according to various estimates, 
can cost up to $1 million, and one kilogram of enriched uranium 
up to $100,000. Now you can imagine the value of the material 
assets that we have already transferred to Russia. 
  [Skachko] How much uranium and plutonium have you 
transferred to Russia? 
  [Kostenko] Approximately 10 tonnes of enriched plutonium and 
more than 90 tonnes of enriched uranium. 
  [Skachko] What is the correlation in parliament of people 
who advocate a solution of the problem of Ukraine's nuclear 
weapons on terms favorable for it and those who are ready to 
give the missiles away? 
  [Kostenko] Judging by the results of voting during the 
ratification of START I, it can said that the majority of 
parliament members are inclined toward organizing a normal 
nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. But what has happened in Moscow 
is not nuclear disarmament but the disrobing of the state. In 
the military, economic, and political sense.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Not Everyone in Ukrainian Missile </F>
Forces Agrees With President Kravchuk"] 
  [Text] There is growing opposition within the Ukrainian 
Army -- as there is within parliament -- to the tripartite 
statement signed in Moscow by President Leonid Kravchuk, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  This IZVESTIYA correspondent has learned that, at a 
Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry Collegium session 21 January devoted to the 
training of military personnel in the country's higher 
educational establishments and the strengthening of discipline 
among the troops, Lieutenant General Vladimir Mikhtyuk, 
commander of the Strategic Missile Forces 43d Missile Army 
stationed in Vinnitsa, and Major General Nikolay Filatov, 
commander of the 46th Missile Division from Pervomaysk in 
Nikolayev Oblast, unexpectedly and without prior arrangement 
took the Ukrainian military oath. 
  Major General Rustam Karimov, commander of the 19th Missile 
Division stationed in Khmelnitskiy, refused to take the 
Ukrainian oath at this collegium session and stated that he 
would not even do so before his own combined unit -- where 40 
percent of the officers do not want to swear an oath of 
allegiance to a fatherland yet again. That accounts for 413 of 
the 1,017 officers in the division. Of these, 354 want to move 
to Russia for the rest of their service, while the others want 
to be discharged to the reserve and go to live back home. 
  Given that, before last Friday, the leading personnel of the 
missile army and missile divisions stationed in Ukraine as well 
as the overwhelming majority of other missile officers had not 
sworn loyalty to Ukraine, this step by the Defense Ministry 
Collegium is being seen by some observers as a direct challenge 
to the policy announced by President Leonid Kravchuk in the 
sphere of his state's nuclear missile disarmament, and as an 
attempt to complicate and delay this process as long as 
possible, to make it as unpredictable as possible, and to 
nullify cooperation with Russia in carrying out the START I and 
II treaties. 
  As is well known, there are 176 strategic RS-18 
liquid-propellant missiles (90 in Khmelnitskiy and 40 in 
Pervomaysk) and RS-22 solid-propellant (all 46 in Pervomaysk) 
launch systems with 1,250 nuclear warheads plus 650 air-launched 
cruise missile assemblies [bloki] in Ukraine. The Strategic 
Nuclear Forces Administrative Command and Control Center is 
located there, and the creation of nuclear space forces has been 
announced. 
  The elimination of the strategic nuclear complex along with 
the country's fulfillment of its commitments under the Lisbon 
Protocol to join the Nonproliferation Treaty as a nuclear-free 
state represents for many Ukrainian generals -- particularly 
those who had recently moved to top jobs in the Kiev Defense 
Ministry -- the complete end of their careers. They will 
naturally do all they can to prevent it. 
  Meanwhile the situation in the Ukrainian Missile Forces -- 
this is no secret to specialists -- remains very complex despite 
all the reassuring statements from Ukrainian generals. Many 
missile systems have come to the end of their warranty and 
inspection and maintenance [reglamentnyy] servicing period. The 
state does not have enough money to carry out the servicing. 
  In 1993 Ukrainian specialists stood down two RS-18 strategic 
missile regiments in Pervomaysk and Khmelnitskiy (10 RS-18's 
each). The nuclear warheads were dismantled and sent to 
technical storage bases, the missiles were removed from their 
silos, their oxidants and fuel were transferred to special 
tanks, and the missiles were loaded onto railcars and prepared 
for dispatch to "Yuzhmashzavod" in Dnepropetrovsk. 
  But each dismantled missile still contains up to 100 kg of 
a highly toxic substance -- one of the components of the missile 
fuel. The equipment to degasify them does not exist, nor does 
the technology for processing the heptyl. The plant turned out 
not to be ready to receive these missiles. 
  It was necessary to remove them from the railcars and 
transfer the toxic liquids from the rail tanks into other 
containers. The dismantling of obsolete [vysluzhivshikh svoi 
sroki] missiles has been halted indefinitely. There are neither 
the warehouses, nor the specialized transportation, nor the 
funds to handle them. Officers are angry that they are being 
forced to do such a dangerous and senseless job. 
  Their service conditions and their pay are far lower than in 
Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces. For instance, a missile 
division commander in Ukraine earns 2.2 million 
coupons-karbovantsi a month. If this sum is expressed in 
Russian rubles [R] at the actual exchange rate (24 to 1), it 
turns out that a Ukrainian general is "valued" less than a 
Russian lieutenant -- who earned around R100,000 in December 
1993 and will have been earning 90 percent more as of January. 
Moreover, last month Ukraine's missile troops received their 
pay literally on the eve of the New Year, after major scandals 
at the Finance Ministry, and have not yet seen any money this 
January.

  [Excerpts] Kiev, 25 Jan -- The Supreme Council of Ukraine 
began its session today under the chairmanship of Speaker Ivan 
Plyushch. [passage omitted] 
  With regard to the issue of Ukraine's accession to the 
nuclear arms nonproliferation treaty, Ivan Plyushch said that 
the last time parliament discussed the issue was on 18 November 
1993, when it adopted reservations concerning ratification of 
the START treaty. Since then, the president of Ukraine has 
carried out a great deal of work which resulted in the signing 
of the Moscow statement. 
  Plyushch said the president of Ukraine requested the Supreme 
Council to examine the issue of Ukraine's accession to the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty. However, the Supreme Council's 
three standing commissions, which met 24 January with the 
participation of the working group dealing with ratification of 
the treaty, failed to find a common solution. 
  The parliament speaker said that this afternoon's session of 
the Supreme Council will look at the resolution on the state 
privatization program for 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Olena Lisnycha: "What Will Ukraine Get From the </F>
Nuclear Deal?"] 
  [Text] At first, it should be emphasized that terms and 
figures included in the agreement by the three presidents and in 
an appendix to it are suspended in a volatile imbalance, because 
that document does not have the force of a concrete 
international legal document, reflecting simply formal political 
obligations assumed by all sides. If that document had the form 
of an agreement or treaty, it would certainly affect our 
internal law, which would enable the parliament to resort to its 
favorite weapon, impeachment. 
  "I have no doubts whatsoever about the legitimacy of what 
was 
done by the executive branch. However, it is up to the Supreme 
Council to examine how this was done," said Mr. Chalyy, chief of 
the legal department at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. Thus, 
the Ukrainian parliament will have to ratify START I with no 
reservations and join the nonproliferation treaty to implement 
the agreement. Ideally, the legislature should endorse START 
II, that is, to give the go-ahead regarding the destruction of 
nuclear arsenals so that the Moscow agreement is legally 
binding. Silenced by top officials of our state, this question 
somehow remains nothing more than rhetoric. 
  It is strange that the agreement's appendix provides for the 
decommissioning of most of the modern SS-24 missiles within 10 
months and not the SS-19's whose short expiration terms cause 
much concern. 
  The agreement signed in Moscow will surely be extended by a 
long chain of negotiations, and its contours -- now pretty vague 
-- will have to become more specific. 
<H5>  Nuclear Fuel </H5>
  "Enriched uranium contained in nuclear arms is a matter of a 
purely commercial nature," said Bill Clinton at a news 
conference at the Boryspil Airport. It was agreed that within 
seven years, Russia would process -- at our expense -- highly 
enriched uranium into fuel for atomic power stations, one 
portion of which will be immediately shipped to Ukraine (100 
tonnes of low-activated uranium in the first 10 months), while 
another part will be sold to the United States for $1 billion. 
Ideally, Washington should send this billion to Kiev. However, 
Russia also claims its portion of the nuclear pie as a country 
tasked with processing the uranium. So far, details regarding 
the division of this billion-dollar tidbit are inaccessible. 
<H5>  Debts for Energy Sources </H5>
  The information that came in last Friday [14 January] about 
Moscow's pledges of fair play in negotiating the $2-billion 
indebtness with Kiev have not borne out entirely. Looming ahead 
is the perspective of endless blanket-pulling and difficult 
inter-governmental talks. According to a dark vision by 
government officials, instead of the entire debt, Russia will 
agree to forgive only its small portion. The point is that 
structures with looser dependence from the state, such as the 
"Gazprom," were also engaged in energy supplies. This kind of 
"debt canceling" is more profitable for them. 
<H5>  Support of International Financial Organizations </H5>
  This support is possible only when Ukraine devises clear-cut 
plans for getting out of an economic crisis. In other words, 
only staunch optimists can count on it at the present time. For 
example, propped up by the United States, Russia is expecting 
$1.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund and $500 
billion from the World Bank. This is a modest sum considering 
the size of Russia, and would remain so if allocated to Ukraine. 
Hypothetically, even with credits on hand, Ukraine should be 
prepared for high interest rates. 
<H5>  Tactical Weapons </H5>
  This appears to be the biggest "white spot" in all this 
nuclear business. The agreement does not offer a clear 
statement on compensation for tactical weapons removed from the 
three ex-Soviet republics to Russia. Officials warily say that 
"experts are now working on this issue." 
<H5>  Support for Weapons Destruction Process </H5>
  This support was offered by the Nunn-Lugar plan initiated in 
December 1991 and will be financed by U.S. Defense Department 
resources. The plan's basic provisions envisioned for 1993 
fiscal year spendings for dismantling and destruction of nuclear 
weapons, establishing aid funds for disarming CIS countries, and 
humanitarian aid, which is $800 million, $100 million, and $410 
million, respectively, for all nuclear successors of the Soviet 
Union. Of this amount, $175 million for technical assistance in 
weapons destruction was promised to Leonid Kravchuk by 
then-President Bush in December 1992. This promise was also 
confirmed by Bill Clinton at the meeting with the Ukrainian 
president in Kiev. The American side is relying on its 
experience of scrapping similar 300-missile complexes in 1992 
that needed $300 billion for destruction. Foreign Ministry 
officials claim that if the process "gets rolling," Americans 
are ready to provide additional funds to Ukraine. On the other 
hand, the Nunn-Lugar program contains quite a few discriminative 
limitations. One of them, for instance, says that the CIS 
country receiving this aid should also put in its own money to 
finance the destruction of nuclear weapons. So disarmament will 
definitely put a squeeze on the more than meager Ukrainian 
budget. In addition, Ukraine will be able to use the $175 
billion only for U.S. and Ukrainian (practically nonexistent) 
technologies and experts. 
  The United States will definitely reap most of the profits 
coming from the nuclear deal. Bill Clinton returned to the 
White House with another victory. The United States will cash 
in on buying cheap fuel for atomic power stations practically 
without spending their budget dollars for the important cause of 
"peace in all the world." Ex-Soviet republics safeguard the 
quiet sleep of Americans because the spread of nuclear 
technologies and weapons to unreliable Asian regimes -- so much 
feared by America shortly before the collapse of the Soviet 
Union -- appears to be unrealistic now. Russia, America's 
strategic partner, achieved its goals by bashing Ukraine on the 
nuclear issue. The issue of energy debts -- one of the 
leverages over Ukraine -- remains unsolved; now even fuel 
supplies to Ukrainian atomic power plants depend on Russia. 
  So what has Ukraine gotten from the deal except for 
international acknowledgment? For now, we can definitely point 
to a great relief for our state budget from a huge burden 
imposed by servicing nuclear complexes. In addition, 
preliminary estimates show that the 100 tonnes of fuel for 
atomic stations, due within 10 months, will keep our plants 
going for two years.

<F P=106> [Report by Oksana Boyko: "Let's Hope"] </F>
  [Text] William G. Miller, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, held 
a news conference in the just-renovated American House on 19 
January devoted to the tripartite Declaration signed by 
Ukrainian, American, and Russian presidents in Moscow last week. 
As expected, the ambassador highly praised this document and 
the efforts by the leaders of the three countries -- especially 
the courage displayed by President Kravchuk -- directed at 
nuclear disarmament. The ambassador also recalled the history 
of nuclear disarmament dating back to late 1960's. William 
Miller himself has been working on this problem for a long time, 
and he also personally knew Andrey Sakharov, the father of a 
hydrogen bomb who ardently fought to rid the world of nuclear 
weapons. 
  The signed tripartite Declaration, stated the ambassador, is 
seen by the United States as an important element in 
intensifying and strengthening bilateral relations with the 
United States, especially in the economic and cultural spheres. 
In the words of the American diplomat, the entire list of the 
conditions put forward by the Supreme Council regarding the 
ratification of START I and the Nonproliferation Treaty was 
included in the agenda of Ukrainian--American-Russian 
negotiations. And all of them have been fulfilled. Of course, 
the ratification of the Moscow agreement by the Supreme Council 
is an affair of the Supreme Council itself and the Ukrainian 
people. However, Mr. Miller believes that when they understand 
all provisions of the document and the scale of events it 
affects, everything will be fine and the agreement will be 
ratified. An interesting discrepancy should be noted here. 
Both the American ambassador and Russian officials refer to the 
document as an "agreement" [preceding word published in English] 
and talk about the need to ratify it. On the other hand, 
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry officials explained that the 
Declaration signed by the presidents is not subject to 
ratification. What should be ratified is START I and Ukraine's 
adherence to the Lisbon Protocol. The Declaration simply points 
to a mechanism for their implementation. Russians have already 
started to talk about the scrapping of Ukrainian nuclear weapons 
as an accomplished fact. Does this mean that each side sees in 
the document what it likes? 
  The issue of money was also brought up at the news 
conference. Why so little (in our opinion, of course)? Mr. 
Miller assured that the United States would not stop at the $175 
million earmarked by the U.S. Congress for the dismantling and 
removal of the missiles. The United States will now orient its 
foreign policy toward expanding comprehensible contacts with 
Ukraine and establishing closer cooperation with it. 
  Asked about nuclear security of a nonnuclear Ukraine, the 
ambassador gave a very diplomatic answer. As for actions by 
international organizations and the United States in the event 
of an assault on Ukraine by some nuclear state, Mr. Miller said 
that in this hypothetical case, the mechanisms established by 
the UN and CSCE Statutes would be initiated. "Let's hope that 
these international organizations will prove strong enough and 
be able to put in motion all powers that they have." A very 
promising perspective, considering the UN's smashing success in 
settling conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, etc. -- 
not to mention indirect aggressions in the sub-Dniester 
Republic, Southern Ossetia, or Abkhazia, which received its own 
powerful Armed Forces out of nowhere -- as well as the great 
respect for international public opinion exhibited by such 
politicians as Zhirinovskiy elbowing his way to the Russian 
leadership. Yes, let's hope that nothing will happen to us -- 
just like in that famous Russian fairy tale.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Blagoveshchensk January 26 TASS -- A regional 
conference of senior officials of the administration of the Far 
Eastern region was held here today. Its agenda included 
prospects of Russian-Chinese cooperation and border relations. 
The conference, the first of this kind, was attended by Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who arrived here on Tuesday 
night en route from Bishkek to China. 
  The relations of partnership and cooperation with China, our 
great neighbour, should be worthy of the two great powers and 
should measure up to the current situation in Asia and the world 
in general, Kozyrev said at the conference. 
  Speaking about the present state of Russian-Chinese 
relations, the minister touched upon the problem of the 
settlement of border disputes between the two countries. Some 
people mention the "seizure of Russian territories in favour of 
China," but this does not correspond to reality. Talks are 
under way between the two countries on this problem, which has 
become of late one of the main irritants in bilateral relations, 
Kozyrev continued. 
  So far as border trade is concerned, its volume exceeded 2.5 
billion dollars in 1993, Kozyrev said. However, we should now 
move to an entirely new stage of the development of border 
cooperation and ties and pass over to production cooperation, 
for which we have all the needed conditions. 
  According to Kozyrev, the problem of opening check points on 
the Russian-Chinese border is also being discussed at the talks. 
During the visit to Beijing an agreement on it is planned to be 
signed, he said. Now there are 21 check points, of which 19 are 
functioning. It is necessary to make their work more orderly and 
to open new ones. The existing check points cannot cope with 
with the enormous flow of people wishing to cross the 
Russian-Chinese border. Last year their total number was 2.5 
million. 
  The Russian foreign minister devoted special attention to 
the 
creation of free economic zones. The study of the experience of 
creating such zones in China will be one of the objectives of 
his visit. 
  Immediately after the end of the conference Kozyrev left for 
the city of Heihe, where he met senior officials of the province 
of Heilongjiang and Heihe. They discussed the development of 
border trade. The Russian foreign minister saw the Heihe free 
economic zone and a passenger check point on the Russian-Chinese 
border. After returning to Blagoveshchensk Kozyrev visited a 
frontier guard post in the western suburb of Blagoveshchensk and 
had a meeting with frontier guards. 
  Kozyrev flies to Beijing today for an official visit.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, speaking in 
Blagoveshchensk at a conference of representatives of regions of 
the Russian Far East bordering on China, said that the volume of 
bilateral trade in 1993 was $2.5 billion, with which it is 
possible to ease the shortage of consumer goods in Russia. 
Kozyrev also said that an agreement would come into force in 
1994 restricting visa-free entry into Russia for citizens of the 
PRC. Visa-free entry will only remain for holders of diplomatic 
or business passports. According to the minister, this is not a 
case of the recreation of an iron curtain. It is, nonetheless, 
necessary to know how many Chinese citizens are on Russian 
territory, Interfax reports.

  [Text] Orel, 25 Jan -- Nobody "can suspect the government 
of rejecting reforms," Viktor Chernomyrdin, said in Orel today 
at a regional conference dedicated to questions of drawing up a 
state program for reviving Central Russia. The head of cabinet 
stressed that "we shall not deviate from the course we have 
chosen." 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin assessed positively the "serious and 
substantial talks" which took place in Orel today both on the 
region's problems and the economic and political state of 
affairs in Russia as a whole. 
  Summing up the results of 1993, the head of government 
annnounced that Gross Domestic Product last year fell by 12 
percent as against 19 percent in 1992 and industrial output by 
16 percent in comparision with 22 percent in 1992. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin stated that "the overall volume of trade grew 
considerably." The population's money income in real terms, 
according to him, grew by 10 percent in comparison with 1992. 
The average monthly rate of inflation fell from 26 percent in 
January 1993 to 12 percent in December. However, there was a 
considerable growth in the rate of inflation at the beginning of 
this year. 
  Chernomyrdin said also that "everything the government does 
is toward implementation of its program, which is tightly linked 
to maximum restraint of inflation." 
  The head of the Cabinet announced that budget expenditure 
for 
the first quarter of 1994 has been held at the level of the 
fourth quarter of last year. Spending items will be financed as 
and when revenues are received by the federal budget. He also 
announced that four trillion rubles have been earmarked in the 
first quarter of 1994 to pay off the state's most outstanding 
debts to the agro-industrial, defense and some other sectors. 
"We must not allow this money to go solely on wages or on 
financing dubious measures or organizations", he stressed. 
  Chernomyrdin set out the government's primary economic goal 
in 1994: "Not to accept any impossible commitments." The 
premier hinted that if the required finance is not available 
then the state will have to refuse to carry out some decisions 
reached earlier at federal level. 
  Chernomyrdin then spoke of the need for a thorough reform of 
the social sphere by way of rational use of state resources. He 
stressed in particular the need to strengthen financial 
stability in the country with a sensible and effective 
investment policy. "In this, I see one of the principal ways of 
achieving a sounder budget," Chernomyrdin remarked. 
  Speaking at the gathering, one of the main aims of which was 
to resolve problems of food supplies and development of 
agriculture in Russia's central oblasts, the premier said that 
he had adopted a decision yesterday to issue 2.3 trillion rubles 
to the agro-industrial complex in the first quarter of 1994. 
"The government has supported and will continue to support 
agriculture in the country".

  [Text] President of the Central Bank of Russia Viktor 
Gerashchenko says the country's budget deficit in 1993 ran at 17 
trillion rubles, or 10.5 percent of GDP. In a speech to the 
governors of 18 regions in the city of Orel on Tuesday, he said 
the main points of a statement on economic, crediting and 
financial policies the government and the Bank made last May had 
been implemented, but this did not lead to curbing inflation as 
planned. On falling inflation at the end of 1993, Gerashchenko 
attributes this to an artificial underfunding of the national 
economy. 
  In his words, money supply was reduced from 60 percent at 
the 
end of 1992 to 30 percent last year. 
  The CBR president called for economic policy corrections and 
for an integrated concept of investment policy raising the 
possibility of subsidizing interest rates for farm credits in 
some cases. He suggested an issuing of government securities on 
a large scale in an attempt to try to narrow this year's deficit. 
  Gerashchenko says that uncertainties about the economic and 
investment climate prevent commercial banks, which accumulated 4 
trillion rubles of "free money" as of January 1, from investing 
it into the economy, an indication of a new spiral of inflation 
being imminent. 
  Under the existing legislation, he said, "we cannot force 
them into investment." The CBR president says that incentives 
such as tax benefits or interest rate subsidies must be created 
to reverse the situation. 
  Gerashchenko has called for seeking ways of attracting those 
free funds into the Russian economy.

  [Text] Orel January 25 TASS -- A four-hour conference of 
leaders of federal bodies and heads of 17 Russian regions ended 
in Orel on Tuesday. The conference decided that "the Federal 
Programme of Development of Central Regions of Russia until the 
Year 2000" be submitted for endorsement by the president and 
government of the Russian Federation early in March this year. 
This programme needs 40.3 trillion roubles to implement. 
  After the conference Russian Prime-Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, told ITAR-TASS the government would make maximum 
efforts to revive regions in Central Russia so that they "could 
feed the whole country". 
  "Before we only pumped resources from Central Russia giving 
nothing in return. This practice should be changed radically", 
the prime-minister said.

Moscow Intends To Get 250 Billion Rubles Returned"] 
  [Text] Leaving yesterday for Orel for a conference of the 
heads of administrations of central Russia, [Prime Minister] 
Viktor Chernomyrdin was busy even on the plane solving regional 
problems, one of the most painful of which is federal government 
debts. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's lights, Moscow Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov, who had interrupted his vacation, did his utmost 
to use the flight together with Russia's head of government to 
get from the premier a firm guarantee: The federal government 
will pay up its debts to Moscow. 
  Despite the declared intention to discuss at the conference 
the prospects of interaction between central Russian regions in 
resolving the problems of the agro-industrial complex, and 
provision of food for big urban centers, the main topic of the 
meeting will of course be the federal government's debt, 
assessed at 8 trillion rubles [R]. The total federal government 
debt to Moscow today is about R250 billion. The mutual 
settlements debt accounts for R117 billion, the Finance Ministry 
has failed to transmit R102 billion for the purchase of food, 
and R33 billion is owed for the maintenance of Moscow's subway 
system. The Moscow mayor's push seems to have yielded results, 
which is likely to lend confidence to the heads of other 
administrations. Although the regions, perhaps, are trying to 
force an open door: Addressing the first session of the new 
Russian Government, its head named as an immediate task the 
payment of all government debts to the agro-industrial complex, 
the military-industrial complex, and the budget sphere.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Jan -- President of the Russian 
Federation Boris Yeltsin has signed an edict appointing Vladimir 
Ignatenko presidential representative in Maritime Kray. This 
was reported by the Russian presidential press service today. 
  On the nomination of the chairman of the Russian Government, 
Boris Yeltsin has appointed by edict Gennadiy Merkulov to the 
post of head of administration for Ryazan Oblast. 
  At the same time the Russian president signed an edict 
removing Lev Bashmakov from the post of head of administration 
for Ryazan Oblast. Lev Bashmakov was removed from his post on 
representations from the chairman of the Russian government for 
systematically exceeding his powers, failing to ensure 
implementation of the edicts of the Russian president aimed at 
building a market economy, and also for taking decisions which 
contribute to the destabilization of the political situation in 
the country.

"North Ossetia Against Bringing Additional Russian Troops. 
State of Emergency Regime Will Apparently Be Extended"] 
  [Text] Vyacheslav Titorenko, representative of the Russian 
Federation Government interdepartmental commission for the 
elimination of the aftermath of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict, 
has arrived in North Ossetia, in the zone under the emergency 
situation regime. According to INTERFAX, the purpose of his 
arrival is to coordinate the actions of all interested 
ministries and agencies, including "power" ministries and 
agencies, to implement the Russian Federation president's edict 
on returning to their homes refugees and those who have been 
forced to resettle. 
  In the meantime, there is growing dissatisfaction in the 
republic at an alleged introduction of additional Russian 
military formations onto its territory. The All-Ossetia 
"Greater Council" ("Styr Nykhas") and the pan-national movement 
"Our Ossetia" have passed a request to Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin to confirm or deny this information. A 
statement circulated by these movements says that on the 
territory of North Ossetia now "there are more than enough 
military formations to ensure security in the zone affected by 
the emergency situation regime." In the view of the statement's 
authors, troops are being brought in the republic in order "to 
create a powerful military fist in the center of the Caucasus," 
capable of "pacifying" the Caucasian peoples." North Ossetia's 
public movements have demanded that the Russian Government 
withdraw the additional troops from the republic's territory, 
and discontinue support to extremist circles in Georgia's 
leadership. 
  It appears that the possible introduction of additional 
Russian troops is causing such dissatisfaction because the 
emergency situation regime is to end on 31 January. On 28 
January, North Ossetia's parliament intends to discuss this 
question, and, according to information from Vladikavkaz, many 
deputies will speak categorically against extending the validity 
of the emergency situation. However, INTERFAX reports, it is 
known from competent sources that the president of North Ossetia 
is now ready to sign an edict extending the state of emergency, 
but that would affect a considerably smaller area. 
  The edict will apparently be signed after Akhsarbek Galazov, 
former chairman of North Ossetia's Supreme Soviet, is sworn in 
as president. The inauguration ceremony has been scheduled for 
26 January. Invitations for the ceremony have been forwarded to 
Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin, government chairman 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, and to the leaders of both chambers of 
Russia's Federal Assembly. The leaders of the North Caucasus 
republics, krays, and oblasts are also expected to arrive in 
Vladikavkaz for the ceremony.

<F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Russian Federation -- </F>
Altay Kray" column] 
  [Text] On 24 January a briefing took place at the Kray 
administration where Vladimir Rayfikesht, former head of the 
Kray administration, spoke about the motives for his 
resignation. V. Rayfikesht cited personal reasons as the main 
motive but refused to comment on it. Furthermore, he considers 
it impossible for him to continue work at the post of kray 
governor owing to the inconsistent reform course pursed by the 
government. Rayfikesht blamed the latter for the economic 
crisis and the colossal outflow of hard currency funds and raw 
materials from Russia. At the same time, Rayfikesht stressed 
that "although the government composition is bad, another would 
have been 100 times worse." In Rayfikesht's opinion, Yeltsin 
can no longer enjoy the entirety of his powers. The former 
governor stressed that the Russian president displayed weakness 
when after the elections to the Federal Assembly he failed to 
consolidate the reformist wing in the government. Hence the 
resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov, which only aggravated the 
situation. Summing up his performance in the kray, Rayfikesht 
stated that he is leaving with a clear conscience. First, the 
kray has not become "a preserve of socialism." Second, market 
structures have been put in place. Rayfikesht stressed that the 
incumbent administration is not responsible for the production 
decline in the kray, since that was largely conditioned by the 
financial and credit policy pursued by the government.

  [Text] Yerevan, 25 Jan (ARMENPRES)--Things are extremely 
tense in the Karabakh conflict zone. The Azerbaijani troops 
resumed their offensive against Mardakert this morning, but the 
Karabakh Army is halting the enemy attacks. An Azerbaijani tank 
was hit by 1030. 
  Active combat operations are taking place in the northwest 
of 
the war front. The enemy's army is trying to move deep into 
Mardakertskiy and Kelbadzharskiy Rayons. Again, the attack is 
being checked. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army Press Service has 
denied an Azerbaijani Defense Ministry statement that claimed 
the Azerbaijani Army was successfully moving deep into 
Kelbadzharskiy Rayon and that the Armenians have suffered 
enormous losses (300 killed).

  [Text] [passage indistinct] Azerbaijan's military forces 
have maintained their attacks against Matagis-Hakob-Kamari in 
the north of Mardakertskiy Rayon. The attacking units advanced 
considerably with the help of armored vehicles. The defense 
forces of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] obstructed the 
enemy's advance at 1100. Latest reports said violent clashes 
took place in the area. There was positional fighting elsewhere 
on the frontline. 
  Azerbaijan's Air Force units have maintained their 
reconnaissance flights in NKR airspace. Several enemy fighter 
aircraft violated NKR airspace on 21 and 22 January. 
  Combat operations against the NKR were intensified again on 
23 January. The HAY LUR NEWS AGENCY office in Stepanakert has 
revealed that Azerbaijan's military forces launched a 
three-pronged attack on the morning of 23 January. Reports said 
the enemy units were forced to retreat after losing many men in 
the clashes around Mardakert. The fighting around Martuni and 
Gadrut was continuing at noon the same day. NKR forces 
obstructed every attack and reinforced their positions in 
several parts of the frontline. 
  Azerbaijan's military forces launched attacks along the 
entire frontline yesterday morning. The HAY LUR NEWS AGENCY 
office in Stepanakert reported that clashes took place near 
[word indistinct] near Mardakert. NKR press and news agencies 
have reported that the freedom fighters hit a tank and killed 
nearly 20 enemy troops in the clashes. The attacks on Martuni 
and Gadrut resumed. The Armenian military forces obstructed the 
enemy attacks and reinforced their positions. The NKR Defense 
Forces still control the vitally important Omar Gorge. Reports 
said clashes are continuing in the area. 
  The situation on the NKR frontline is tense. In parallel 
with their attacks, the Azerbaijani military forces recently 
used their Air Force units in the clashes. The NKR Military 
Information Department has reported that two of Azerbaijan's 
military aircraft tried to attack Stepanakert at 1230 on 20 
January. The NKR Air Defense Forces shot an attacking aircraft 
some 8 or 10 km from Stepanakert. The pilot's fate is unknown. 
  The NKR Defense Forces have obstructed all the enemy attacks 
on Agdam, Askeran, Gadrut, and Mardakert during the past three 
days. Azerbaijan lost 35 men in the clashes. The Armenian side 
lost two men. Six others were wounded. 
  Azerbaijan's military forces fired on the NKR positions with 
various types of arms yesterday morning. Azerbaijan's Defense 
Ministry has claimed that the Armenian side has lost 300 men and 
that Azerbaijan's military units have penetrated Kelbadzharskiy 
Rayon's inner areas. The NKR Military Information Service has 
denied that report.

  [Text] Yerevan, 25 Jan (ARMENPRES)--Bagrat Asaturyan, 
president of the Armenian Central Bank, told reporters that the 
Armenian coins known as lumas will be brought to the Republic. 
The absence of the luma is creating major problems, mostly in 
retail trade, and is causing artificial inflation in the price 
of some goods. 
  Asaturyan also said that Iran's "Mellath" Bank will be the 
first foreign bank to start operating in Armenia soon. The 
building to be allocated to the bank in Republic Square is not 
ready. The Armenian side is doing everything to enable the bank 
to start operating as soon as possible. 
  The Armenian Central Bank reported a noticeable flow of 
forged Russian rubles and dollars from Russia to Armenia. 
Circulation is helped by the existence of a foreign currency 
"black market."

Plunges. Some Public Poll Results"] 
  [Text] According to the results of a poll conducted in 
Armenia by the Center for the Study of Public Opinion of the 
"Association of National Self-Determination" party, as little as 
18.9 percent of the respondents support the policy of President 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Of those polled, 71.8 percent replied in 
the negative. 
  All in all, 17.5 percent would once again vote for Mr. 
Ter-Petrosyan. Incidentally, 52.7 percent of those polled at 
the time of the 1991 presidential elections voted for the 
current president. Hence, his rating has plunged in the past two 
years nearly three-fold. 
  The performance of the government and parliament is approved 
correspondingly by 7.7 and 6.9 percent of those polled. 
  Of interest is the attitude to the Constitution: those for a 
Constitutional Assembly comprised 8.1 percent, those for a 
referendum 21.5 percent, 9.7 percent of those polled are ready 
to entrust this job to the Supreme Soviet, and 20.7 percent were 
undecided on the matter.

  [Text] Baku January 25 TASS -- Azeri troops are 
successfully advancing towards the south-western town of 
Kelbadzhar, earlier captured by Armenians, the Defence Ministry 
of Azerbaijan reported on Tuesday. Kelbadzhar is still being 
controlled by Armenians in spite of their heavy losses in recent 
combat operations. 
  The ministry experts associate the desperate attempts of the 
Armenian troops to keep control over Kelbadzhar with the 
existence of gold mines in the region. 
  According to the source, "in the past few days the enemy has 
brought into action even badly trained recruits" in a bid to 
hold the positions. 
  The Azeri military say that as a result of their latest 
military success, the Armenian troops near the town of Agderi 
were cut off from supplies from Armenia. 
  On Monday Azeri troops surrounded and completely destroyed a 
group of 240 Armenian servicemen who tried to penetrate the 
combat zone from Armenia, the source added.

has succeeded in advancing towards Kelbadzhar in south-west 
Azerbaijan. According to the Defence Ministry, the enemy's 
troops in Kelbadzhar were repulsed to the frontier between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia while troops in Agdere [Mardakert] were 
cut off from their main base in Armenia. Armenian Armed Forces 
are still occupying the town of Kelbadzhar in spite of heavy 
casualties. 
  The Defence Ministry says that the Armenian Army 
headquarters 
try to hold the Kelbadzhar base in every way. Military experts 
consider gold-fields of Kelbadzhar a reason for Armenians 
staying there. Trying to hold their positions in Kelbadzhar, the 
enemy has thrown badly trained recruits into battle over the 
last time, the ministry says. 
  Yesterday the Azeri National Army encircled and destroyed a 
group of 240 Armenian soldiers, which has tried to break through 
from Armenian to Kelbadzhar.

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev says the Azeri army is 
setting an example of heroism reviving the nation's confidence, 
respect and love for its defenders. Speaking during a visit to 
an army unit on Monday, he said there was a revival of patriotic 
feelings in the nation and that latest developments indicated 
the ability by the Azeris and their army to defend their own 
lands." 
  Aliyev spoke of military successes notched up by the army on 
the frontlines of Fizuli, Kelbajar, Agdam and Agderin 
(Mardakert) recently and the nation's pride and joy over those 
achievements. 
  At the same time, the President said that Baku was opposed 
to 
war and still committed to a peaceful solution to the conflict. 
However, the Armenian army continues aggression against 
Azerbaijan by launching new offensives, he said. 
  Aliyev pledged commitment to further efforts for a 
negotiated 
settlement to the conflict saying appropriate contacts were 
under way to this end including Armenia. But he warned against 
further Armenian aggression saying his country would have no 
other option but to recover lost territory by force if that was 
not stopped. 
  The President called on Yerevan to relinquish the occupied 
territories of its own accord, withdraw its troops and respect 
the sovereignty and integrity of Azerbaijan. The war will end 
if the Armenian government fulfils those conditions, Aliyev said.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Vyzhutovich based on "recent" interviews </F>
with Ayaz Mutalibov, Abulfaz Elchibey, and Geydar Aliyev, in 
Moscow, Keleki, and Baku respectively: "To the Last Drop of 
Power"] 
  [Text] Three Prophets in Their Own Country 
  On 6 March 1992, under pressure from the armed opposition, 
Ayaz Mutalibov, first president of independent Azerbaijan, 
signed his resignation, only six months after being elected to 
the post. After an attempt to regain power which soon proved 
abortive, Mutalibov left the republic on board a military 
aircraft and has not gone back to this day. 
  On 17 June 1993, as a result of an armed rebellion raised in 
Ganja by Colonel Suret Guseynov, the newly elected Azerbaijani 
President Abulfaz Elchibey was forced to leave Baku secretly and 
return to his home village of Keleki in the Nakhichevan 
Autonomous Republic, where he still is. 
  On 3 October 1993, by a nationwide vote, Geydar Aliyev came 
to power in Azerbaijan, and he is presently exercising the 
powers of head of state. 
  All three consider themselves the legitimate president. All 
three lay claim to the role of father of the nation. Each of 
the three has his own view of the situation in the republic and 
his own action program. 
  I recently met with all three. 
<H5>  Audiences </H5>
  In Moscow: I was helped to find Ayaz Mutalibov, who lives 
"somewhere near Moscow," by better informed colleagues. Secret 
contacts came into play, invisible threads were pulled, and 
soon, on the strength of a pledge to report the planned 
interview without bias, I was instructed to stay by the 
telephone for the next 15 minutes. 
  Mutalibov himself called. He said he was willing to meet, 
and dictated the address, on the condition that it was not to be 
handed over to anyone else. Half an hour later I found myself 
in a spacious, well-appointed, pleasantly furnished apartment 
almost in the center of Moscow, where, according to Mutalibov, 
relatives of his live and where he periodically meets with 
people he wants to see. So I too was unable to visit the dacha 
near Moscow which a businessman friend has rented for Mutalibov. 
The ex-president, his wife, and their son and his family have 
found shelter at that dacha for nearly two years now. The 
out-of-town house, whose whereabouts are known only to a very 
narrow circle, can probably be regarded as a place of political 
asylum too, since a criminal charge still stands against 
Mutalibov for failing, as president, to prevent the seizure and 
destruction by Armenian gunmen of the Azerbaijani city of 
Khodzhaly. "Aliyev says I could go back to the republic as an 
ordinary citizen and live there freely, unoppressed. That is 
not true. As soon as I turn up in Baku they will promptly 
arrest me." 
  We each drank a glass of Azerbaijani "Goy Gel" cognac and 
ate 
a slice of bread with black caviar, ignoring for the time being 
the expensive candies, nuts, and fruit. Then I gestured 
interrogatively toward the dictaphone, and my host nodded: 
"Switch it on." 
  In Keleki: Barely had the plane from Baku, arriving in 
Nakhichevan eight hours late, come to a halt on the tarmac, when 
I was intercepted at a passport check right there on the ramp. 
Having been escorted to the chief of the commandant's office, I 
was immediately subjected to questioning: Why had I come? To 
see whom? My newspaper accreditation only heightened this 
vigilant interest, as the Baku organizers of my meeting with 
Elchibey had warned me beforehand: Press attention toward the 
disgraced ex-president is not encouraged by the authorities; 
better keep quiet about who it is you have come to see, or else 
they will send you straight back on the same flight. 
  Having taken these instructions on board, I spoke very 
vaguely about the purpose of my visit, and as soon as they let 
me go, I made my way to the People's Front headquarters within 
20 minutes; from there Elchibey's comrades delivered me to the 
rayon center of Ordubad. 
  There in Ordubad, in the building of the former KGB rayon 
directorate, is the stronghold of the ex-president's bodyguard, 
with two armored carriers in the yard and, on duty around the 
clock, unshaven men in camouflage uniform carrying automatic 
weapons. In the guardroom, no bigger than a lobby, I counted 
eight portraits of Elchibey, next to an "iconostasis" lovingly 
arranged on a wall made of empty cigarette cartons. 
  As night approached, in pitch darkness, we left for Keleki. 
Five people were crammed into a fully equipped UAZ jeep, 
including a man with an automatic weapon who hid under a 
tarpaulin. Three times there suddenly emerged from the gloom 
along the way a trailer perched on the roadside or some other 
kind of checkpoint, from which armed men sprang out, barring our 
vehicle's path. They demanded the password, asked who was being 
transported and what for, and, satisfied with a brief report, 
withdrew into the darkness. 
  The residence of Mr. President (I was instructed to address 
my lofty interviewee as that, and nothing else) turned out to be 
a village building apparently intended for public use, some kind 
of club or office -- frankly I could not make it out properly, 
because there was not a glimmer of light around it; the 
blockade.... Here, I was told, the president works from very 
early morning until late at night (by the light produced by a 
small generator, or a kerosene lamp), receiving the information 
he needs by telephone, and also "from other sources." Nobody 
specified exactly what sources, but it was said that regular 
visits are made to Keleki by a few former staffers of the 
presidential apparatus who have remained loyal to Elchibey, 
retired ministers, and certain members of the Azerbaijani 
parliament. Moreover it was stressed particularly that the 
"legitimate president of Azerbaijan in exile" maintains contact, 
as is proper, with foreign diplomats and statesmen. 
  Apart from numerous relatives, Elchibey has with him in 
Keleki his wife and two school-age children. 
  I was instructed to present for inspection the bag holding 
my 
journalist's equipment. Then the chief bodyguard searched my 
pockets and the folds of my clothing with his own hands. 
  Finally the audience took place. Abulfaz Elchibey sat at a 
desk on whose smooth surface not a single object was to be seen 
except for the telephone and an ashtray. The entire expanse of 
wall behind my host's back was occupied by a map of Azerbaijan, 
and next to it the state flag of the republic was hoisted. 
  "I am pursuing a course of resisting the rebel power," 
Elchibey said, in his native language, from which he never once 
departed in a 90-minute talk simultaneously interpreted by an 
aide. 
  In Baku: At about two o'clock in the morning, the head of 
the press service cut short my wait: "The president will be 
working for another hour or hour-and-a-half, he sends his 
apologies." This could also be taken to mean that, at least 
until the time indicated, the state secretary, prime minister, 
head of parliament, ministers, and leaders of all the services 
of the president's apparatus also would not leave their offices. 
This work schedule was usual for Aliyev while he was, for 14 
years, at the head of the republic, and it resumed when he 
returned to power. 
  Be that as it may, at the second attempt I was admitted to 
the official presidential apartments, which -- unlike 
Mutalibov's and Elchibey's surroundings -- I consider it 
superfluous to describe. 
  "I don't give interviews," Aliyev said, after a firm 
handshake, "I don't have the time." 
  That was how our two-hour talk began.... 
  Now, having, by means of a newspaper device, placed the 
holder of real power on the same footing as two political 
recluses who have lost that power at the whim of dramatic 
circumstances, I am clearly not safe from objections on the part 
of Geydar Aliyev, whose status is undeniably not to be compared 
with the status of Ayaz Mutalibov or Abulfaz Elchibey, who, 
although they consider themselves presidents, are free of the 
burden of state decisions and the responsibility for them. This 
difference in the positions of three well-known Azerbaijani 
politicians, whose judgments and opinions, by creating a 
stereoscopic effect, help us to approach a calm, unbiased 
understanding of what is happening in the republic -- this 
crucial difference should, I urge you, be kept in mind hereafter. 
<H5>  By Wartime Laws </H5>
  On 2 November Geydar Aliyev addressed the people, presenting 
a detailed explanation of the reasons for the heavy defeats in 
the war, and called on citizens "to defend Azerbaijan from 
aggression by Armenian armed forces." Three and a half weeks 
later the republic National Assembly tightened up -- with the 
stipulation "for the duration of the war" -- the operation of a 
number of articles of the Criminal Code. Henceforth, evasion of 
the military draft carries the threat of five to eight years' 
imprisonment. For evasion of mobilization, a prison term of 
seven to 10 years is stipulated, or 10-15 years where there are 
aggravating circumstances. For absence without leave from a 
military unit at the front, there is 10-15 years' imprisonment, 
or even the death penalty. 
  Those are the wartime laws adopted by the Azerbaijani 
parliament and approved, according to December's figures, by one 
out of every two people polled by the sociological group of the 
republic State Committee for Statistics. The warring 
Azerbaijani clans and groupings build their relations by these 
same laws, having thoroughly grasped, for instance, this law: 
that a defeat in war is a defeat in politics. 
  So does that mean that losses and casualties at the front 
would suit some people in the republic? 
  A. Mutalibov: "I would give a straight answer if I had the 
facts available, but in any event nobody in Azerbaijan will be 
surprised by this question. A power struggle is going on. And 
some people will stop at nothing in this struggle." 
  G. Aliyev: "We are constantly observing a desire on the part 
of some political forces to reap benefits for themselves from 
our military defeats. These forces -- first and foremost 
People's Front forces -- are engaged in carrying out 
provocations in the Army, going out to rayons close to the front 
line and intimidating the population.... These forces have 
especially tried to create the conditions for the seizure of 
Azerbaijani rayons by the aggressors. We have information that 
these forces, as the main culprits to blame for the situation in 
which Azerbaijan now finds itself, wish to regain lost positions 
and wreak revenge...." 
  A. Elchibey: "I categorically reject such accusations 
against the People's Front. Geydar Aliyev is distorting the 
truth, to put it mildly. He must know that it was when we were 
in power that international efforts to settle the conflict 
became more active and the UN Security Council resolution 
providing for, in particular, the withdrawal of Armenian troops 
from Kelbadzharskiy Rayon, was adopted. Incidentally, this was 
the only rayon captured during my leadership of the republic. 
Whereas under Aliyev six rayons have already been occupied, and 
it is clear to everybody that the new authorities are unable to 
ensure the country's defense and incapable of crating a strong, 
professional army." 
  As of today 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory is under 
occupation. The country has 1.2 million refugees, providing for 
whom has already cost the republic budget 5 billion rubles, 
whereas several times this amount is required. Refugees are not 
given jobs. They are not paid benefits and pensions on time. 
Concentrations of refugees have unprecedented disease and death 
rates. As yet the new authorities have come up with very few 
successful ways to ease the fate of these unfortunates, unless 
you count the option suggested by the newspaper AZERBAIJAN, 
which is more than respectful to the president: "Guest houses, 
schools, and hostels do not need to be emptied to house 
refugees. The coziest refuge for a million refugees is Geydar 
Aliyev's heart." 
  G. Aliyev: "I consider that every family in Baku and other 
cities and rayons could take a refugee family. This would be 
very charitable. Some people have enormous houses and big 
apartments. Let each one of them house a refugee family. For my 
part, I recently instructed the Cabinet to take additional 
measures." 
  A. Mutalibov: "No measures will be of any help so long as 
the Karabakh map is a bargaining chip in the political game 
being played by the Azerbaijani clans, groupings, and 
individuals waging a bitter power struggle." 
<H5>  Reforms by Installments </H5>
  A Baku black marketeer, who responded with alacrity to my 
request to be driven to Government House, explained to me his 
interpretation of the difference between the previous and the 
present authorities: "A year ago a traffic cop would sting you 
for 50 manats, whereas now the going rate is at least a 
thousand." 
  This has nothing to do with the change of authorities, of 
course. The scale of graft is also about the same as it was. 
It's just that the scale of prices is now different: 
inflation.... It has reached a rate of 40 percent a month. 
  At the end of November bread and gasoline prices were raised 
750 percent by presidential edict. In response to a question 
from sociologists "how do you react to this," 29.2 percent of 
those polled answered: "Negatively -- the edict will have no 
effect in terms of stabilizing the economy." 
  G. Aliyev: "Prices for the most important products should 
have been regulated at the right time, considerably earlier than 
a year ago. Rather than people engaging in populism. 
Azerbaijan has close economic and simply human links with 
neighboring states. The difference in prices between here and 
there had a painful impact on our already crisis-ridden economy, 
which, furthermore, is largely geared to defense. Measures had 
to be taken." 
  Only after bread in Azerbaijan started costing 22 manats 
(220 
rubles) did the waiting lines for it diminish appreciably, but 
they have not yet disappeared. There are no waiting lines for 
meat, but it is rationed in the state trading network. As are 
sugar and butter. Admittedly "August" butter was only 
distributed in December, and there has been no meat since July. 
The consumer shopping basket costs 6,000 manats as against an 
average wage of 2,500. 
  A. Elchibey: "The whole point is that following the 
insurrection and my removal from power the National Assembly did 
not adopt a single law opening the way to market reforms. My 
edicts on privatization and the development of enterprise went 
unfulfilled; they were removed from circulation, as it were. At 
the same time uncontrolled privatization is steaming ahead. 
Mafia clans originating, as a rule, in the former party 
nomenklatura are getting their hands on plants and factories in 
exchange for big bribes.... Corruption has assumed a 
catastrophic scale." 
  A. Mutalibov: "Elchibey hoped that, severing ties with 
Russia and other neighbors, Azerbaijan would resolve its 
economic tasks by means of radical reforms. But this is 
impossible. Market reforms must be implemented simultaneously 
in all the countries of the former Union; it impossible to 
destroy what are virtually centuries-old economic links and 
break everything up at a stroke. I am a supporter of gradual and 
cautious entry into the market. Although I believe that the 
state hat which the republic's enterprises are currently forced 
to wear is preventing them from developing freely. This is the 
other, equally destructive extreme." 
  G. Aliyev: "Who is preventing, and whom? I even banned MVD 
and Prosecutor's Office organs from checking the financial and 
economic activity of state and commercial enterprises. 
Henceforth such checks will be carried out only by the tax 
inspectorate. I repeat: Our point of reference is a market 
economy, a combination and interaction of various forms of 
ownership. In the very near future parliament will again 
examine the question of privatization...." 
  According to data from a poll conducted by the "Mirror" 
["Zerkalo"] republic newspaper, 70 percent of Azerbaijan's 
highest-profile entrepreneurs regard present conditions here as 
unconducive to private business. And to the question "How do 
you assess the prospects" 62 percent answered: "They will 
develop, but slowly." Here 48 out of the 50 people polled said 
that the decisive condition for the development or, conversely, 
the diminution of enterprise is the government's attitude to it. 
And they were practically all agreed that one of the main 
obstacles to the free and civilized development of private 
business is the corruption among state officials, who are 
continuing to struggle for power and spheres of influence. The 
nature of this struggle is evidenced, in part, by the fact that 
two-thirds of the entrepreneurs only agreed to participate in 
the study after being firmly assured that the poll would be 
anonymous. 
<H5>  In the Open and Behind the Scenes </H5>
  Political skirmishes in Azerbaijan continue to take place in 
the open and behind the scenes. But now there is less shooting. 
  The opposition, whose ranks contain several parties of 
varying degrees of radicalism, is not reticent. The 
front-runners here are the People's Front, whose chairman is 
still Abdulfaz Elchibey, and the "Musavat" party, headed by 
former parliament speaker Isa Kambarov. Both organizations 
regard Elchibey as the lawful president and Geydar Aliyev as an 
inveterate political intriguer who seized power through an 
insurgence. 
  In Isa Kambarov's view, Aliyev "is trying to govern an 
independent state using the same methods he used to govern a 
former Soviet republic." The "Musavat" party chairman also 
believes that, by refusing cooperation with any influential 
political force and relying solely on the apparatus, Aliyev is 
narrowing his social base and risks losing power within a few 
months if the round of military defeats continues. 
  G. Aliyev: "I am open to cooperation with all political 
forces. But you see what happens.... I offered National 
Independence Party Chairman Etibar Mamedov a choice of four 
state posts, particularly the post of foreign minister. He 
refused. Meanwhile there are representatives of various parties 
working successfully in the government, including people with a 
People's Front background.... Recently I held a meeting with 
party and movement leaders. Everybody came except 
representatives of the National Front, while the 'Musavat' party 
sent an observer as if we were having a meeting of some kind of 
official international body. This is all a joke...." 
  A. Elchibey: "How can you talk about any kind of cooperation 
with these authorities when human rights are being trampled 
underfoot. First a citizen is handcuffed right in the 
parliament chamber, then a few days later the question of 
stripping him of his deputy's immunity is raised. That was how 
National Assembly Chairman Isa Kambarov was arrested; that was 
how former republic General Prosecutor Ikhtiyar Shirinov was 
taken into custody.... Former Defense Minister Ragim Kaziyev was 
arrested and accused of corruption; former First Deputy Minister 
of National Security Sulkhetdin Akperov is behind bars.... 
There are currently around 40 political detainees in 
Azerbaijan." 
  G. Aliyev: "I don't know how many. This is criminal 
activity, not politics." 
  This -- if not more so -- is the pitch at which the 
confrontation at the top in Azerbaijan goes on, out of sight of 
the public at large. By carrying out a ruthless purge of the 
government and the presidential apparatus Geydar Aliyev 
strengthened his power by precisely the same extent as he 
undermined it by squeezing out his rancorous opponents in the 
shape of the vice premiers, power ministers, and other state 
officials put into retirement or into the dock, each of whom is 
backed by influential clans and groupings. 
  But the main source of discomfort for Aliyev, of course, is 
Suret Guseynov, the rebel colonel who successfully swapped his 
combat enthusiasm for the premiership in June. The new cabinet 
head's incompetence seems to be obvious to everyone in the 
republic, from State Secretary Lala Gadzhiyeva, who asked me not 
to ask her questions about Guseynov, to a semi-literate peasant 
tea-picker. 
  G. Aliyev: "He was appointed following a proposal from me 
and is working." 
  This was the briefest presidential answer during our 
interview. 
  A. Elchibey: "Aliyev cannot remove Guseynov yet. That would 
mean admitting that what happened in Ganja was nothing but an 
insurrection -- that is, Aliyev obtained power from a rebel and 
them formalized it via a nationwide vote. Guseynov, on the 
other hand, is a puppet figure. He contents himself with his 
lofty title without having real influence. The ministers of 
defense, national security, and internal affairs are subordinate 
to the Defense Council, which is headed by Aliyev. He controls 
all the key posts in the government. Aliyev and his people will 
never concede anything to us. They will fight to the last drop 
of power." 
<H5>  "Who Else?" </H5>
  This is the general feeling. No matter who I spoke with 
anywhere in Azerbaijan (state officials and politicians aside), 
they almost all said the same thing: If not Geydar, who else 
will help us? 
  They trust him. Or rather, they trust in him. This 
desperate, maybe last-chance faith in a political messiah, a 
politician who will bring them salvation from the universal 
trials and tribulations, is already close to religious in some 
respects. To the question "who do you trust in the current 
crisis situation?" 77.8 percent of participants in a December 
poll answered: "Azerbaijan President G. Aliyev." He has to his 
credit: entry into the CIS, the restoration and strengthening 
of relations with Russia, the initiation of contacts with Iran 
and France, first successes in building a national army, the 
stopping of the separatist movement in the south of the 
republic, and the relative stabilization of the sociopolitical 
situation. On the debit side there are the six occupied rayons. 
Nobody here would be forgiven that number of defeats. For the 
time being Aliyev is being forgiven. 
  A. Mutalibov: "He is undoubtedly a highly experienced 
politician capable of skillfully controlling people and 
therefore the country. So when I became leader of the country I 
did not obstruct his return from Moscow and reacted calmly to 
his decision to return to politics. Unfortunately, counter to 
expectations, our relationship did not develop, in my view 
because of some of his past opponents, who managed to come 
between us...." 
  The people's trust in whoever is national leader is not 
boundless, however. At the presidential elections Abulfaz 
Elchibey obtained 59 percent of the vote, but last fall 98 
percent of those who participated in the referendum gave him a 
vote of no confidence. Barely a year had passed! 
  Disillusionment with democracy? A reversion to type, to the 
old pattern of life? Neither. In Aliyev Azerbaijan sees not a 
former member of Brezhnev's Politburo but first and foremost a 
highly experienced politician, a ruthless pragmatist, and a 
competent administrator. 
  In Azerbaijan, Russia, and other republics which survived 
the 
disintegration of the USSR people today are less and less 
interested in ideological labels. They are less and less 
interested in the color of the flag and more and more interested 
in bread prices, the size of wages or pensions, and guarantees 
of peace and tranquility. 
  And there is increasing revulsion everywhere to a power 
struggle for its own sake, irrespective of who is involved or 
under what slogans. The experience of our troubled times brooks 
no delusion about the speed with which the last drop of power 
becomes far from the first drop of blood.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 25 Jan -- An IBERIA correspondent has 
learned that Hamlet Chipashvili, head of the Georgian 
parliamentary staff, has been released from his duties on the 
orders of Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgian head of state. He is 
blamed for failing to promptly make available the full text of 
the Geneva communique to parliamentary members. 
  The parliamentary opposition regards this as the head of 
state's political retaliation against parliamentary vice speaker 
Rusudan Beridze, who oversees the work of the staff. 
  Similar statements were made by the Republicans and Charter 
91, who are Ilya Chavchavadze Association factions. The 
parliamentary majority, in fact, agreed with the decision of the 
head of state and the parliamentary speaker on releasing Hamlet 
Chipashvili from his duties.

murder!" Constantin Gamsakhurdia, son of the former Georgian 
president who died in early January in as yet unexplained

was the victim of a conspiracy. 
  Passing through Paris, he affirmed to us: "It is a typically 
Communist method to cast doubts on the circumstances of my 
father's death and on his death itself: Information is filtered 
to soothe emotions. If the Georgian population had immediately 
been informed about my father's death, it would have come out 
into the streets to display its grief. Constantin Gamsakhurdia 
agrees with the idea, put forward by his mother and endorsed by 
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, for an international 
commission to investigate Zviad Gamsakhurdia's death, but he 
thinks it will be difficult to find witnesses: "Those who know 
how my father died are partisans. What will be done to them 
after they give their testimony?"

  [Text] The first deputy chairman of the Georgian gas 
department, Tamaz Gagua, gave an interview to Georgian radio 
today. Here is an excerpt from that interview. 
  [Begin Gagua recording] Our republic needs 23-24 million 
cubic meters of gas per day for the normal functioning of 
enterprises in winter. We still do not have the opportunity to 
buy gas in such quantities. Until today we were receiving 
11.5-12.0 million cubic meters, which is about 45 percent of the 
demand. 
  However, since we were not fulfilling contractual 
obligations 
-- as you know, all the gas comes from the Republic of 
Turkmenistan -- we received a harsh notice yesterday morning. 
It said that due to a failure to fulfill contractual 
obligations -- what they meant was the non-payment of a large 
debt in respect of a gas transit service -- the gas supply would 
be terminated at 1800 hours yesterday. 
  This was followed by a message from Moscow. It was based on 
Turkmen information. The message was signed by a deputy 
chairman of the Russian joint stock company Gazprom, (Revizov). 
It said that at the request of Turkmenistan the gas supply to 
Georgia would be terminated at 1800 hours. 
  You can easily imagine what the consequences would have 
been. 
We did our best to put off the implementation of such harsh 
sanctions. After intensive talks with our colleagues we reached 
an agreement with them that these sanctions would not be 
implemented. However, the supply of gas was sharply reduced. 
Yesterday morning we were getting up to 12 million cubic meters 
of gas a day, while now we are being supplied with 8.5-9.0 
million. 
  By a decision of the republic's deputy prime minister a 
government delegation has been set up and will fly, probably 
tomorrow, Sunday [23 January], to Turkmenistan for talks. We 
hope that this issue will be solved positively next week and 
that the supply of gas will be resumed at the pre-reduction 
level. [end recording]

  [Text] As has already been reported, the new Kazakh 
Parliament will consist of 177 deputies -- 135 deputies will be 
elected [word indistinct] at the constituencies, and 42 will 
become deputies from the state list nominated by the president 
of the republic and to be elected by constituencies formed 
within the borders of relevant oblasts and cities with 
republican subordination status.

nominate. Addressing those invited, the president said that the 
list was formed with special care and thoughtfulness. The 
criteria of selection was very strict because a new parliament 
-- to be formed this spring -- should be professional. All 
deputies of the new convocation of the Supreme Kenges will have 
to leave their previous jobs and concentrate on law-making 
activities. Nazarbayev stressed: I think that all those present 
today are the president's first ever team capable of fulfilling 
their authority, but the final choice will be made by the 
electorate. The head of state promised that he would fully 
support his candidates and wished them success in their not so 
easy work. 
  Also attending the meeting were the vice president and 
[words 
indistinct].

<F P=106> [Vladimir Ardayev report: "World Community Grants </F>
Kazakhstan Over $1 Billion in Loans"] 
  [Text] Almaty -- A consultative conference of "donor" 
countries providing financial assistance to Kazakhstan has ended 
in Paris. It was decided that the republic will be allocated 
more than $1 billion this year to continue economic reform. 
  Kazakhstan's main "donors" were the IMF, the International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Asian banks, and a 
number of states. For instance, $220 million was allocated by 
the Japanese Government. The European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development has granted a 100 million-ECU [European currency 
unit] targeted loan for the financing of small and medium-sized 
enterprises. 
  The loans are being provided to Kazakhstan on favorable 
terms. For instance, the IMF loans are repayable over 17 years 
at an annual interest rate of 7 percent. Interest only will be 
paid for the first five years. 
  These facts were cited by Kazakhstani President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev in an interview with the newspaper KAZAKHSTANSKAYA 
PRAVDA.

  [Text] Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev disagrees 
with those who are pessimistic about the future of the CIS. 
  In an interview published in today's KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA 
he notes that at the Ashgabat summit the positions of CIS 
countries moved closer together on all matters, notably on 
economic ones. Kazakhstan believes that the economies of CIS 
countries can be stabilized through strengthening the 
integration processes within the framework of the economic 
union, which has now been set up. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that the introduction of 
individual currencies is a powerful enough impetus for the 
integration of Commonwealth states. He believes that at some 
stage a currency will emerge that will be valid in all CIS 
states. 
  All problems ought to be solved in close cooperation with 
fellow Commonwealth members, and for Kazakhstan that means first 
and foremost with Russia, Nursultan Nazarbayev noted.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 15 (505)] </F>
  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev has decided to set up 
a committee to deal with ethnic tensions that exist, he said, in 
relations between individuals. The new body will also draft 
bills for parliament to debate and advise the executive branch, 
he told the KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper. 
  He said that migration such as that taking place in the 
country was inevitable when empires collapse. In the 
president's words, over 200,000 Russians and still more Germans 
had left Kazakhstan last year. He described their departure as 
"a significant loss." During the same period nearly 160,000 
Russians, some of them from Russia, settled in the country. 
  Nazarbayev emphasized that he had decreed a simplification 
of 
the citizenship acquisition procedure for those who have close 
relatives in the country. 
  He said that dual citizenship was an issue "imposed from 
outside the country" and that such citizenship was not provided 
for by the Constitution of Kazakhstan or Russia. If every other 
Kazakh resident is also a citizen of another state, the Kazakh 
society may be split into natives and aliens, chaos and mistrust 
can be created, the Kazakh leader thinks. 
  Nazarbayev called for creating conditions within the 
Commonwealth for free movement and communication so that when 
one moves to Russia, he or she obtains its citizenship freely 
and, on return to Kazakhstan, that country's citizenship. He 
called for working out "an agreed document allowing one to live 
where one wants (in the CIS), whatever the citizenship." 
  Nazarbayev said he pinned great hopes on the new parliament 
to be elected on March 7. He wants to work with parliament on 
amending the Fundamental Law and emphasized the need to specify 
in the Constitution that the country was a presidential 
republic, increase the powers of the executive branch and 
introduce a bicameral parliament consisting of a senate and a 
house of deputies. 
  In Nazarbayev's view, parliament must have the right to 
discontinue the president's powers before his term expires and 
the president, to dissolve parliament. 
  The president also said in the interview that "it was time 
that we took a wider view of land rights" and called for 
appointing judges for life and for removal of obstacles to 
entrepreneurial activities in every sphere.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Almaty, 22 January -- Any attempts to use 
interethnic relations for one's own ends should be strictly 
punished by law, President Nursultan Nazarbayev is convinced. 
  He has decided to set up a Council for Citizens' Rights 
under 
the president. This representative body will draw up bills for 
the Supreme Council and recommendations for the executive 
authority aimed at fundamentally increasing accountability for 
inciting interethnic dissension, for all forms of provocations, 
destabilizing the sociopolitical situation in the republic, and 
offending citizens' honor and national dignity. Nazarbayev 
stated this in an interview published in today's KAZAKHSTANSKAYA 
PRAVDA. 
  My aspiration is for Kazakhstan's citizens to live 
prosperously as a single amicable family, he commented. I call 
upon all compatriots as before to strengthen peace and accord in 
our common home, to yield to no provocations, and to analyze 
critically those populist slogans and calls of pseudo-democrats 
that are being proclaimed so vigorously at rallies in the run-up 
to the elections to legislative and representative bodies of 
power scheduled for 7 March. One must also regard with healthy 
criticism those publications in the local and foreign press that 
are constructed upon biassed and amateur statistics. 
  Touching on the topic of the "Russian-speaking population," 
Nazarbayev commented that this is a term he does not accept at 
all. Virtually all residents in the republic, including Kazakhs, 
he said, are Russian speakers. You would hardly find anyone in 
Kazakhstan who does not speak Russian. Russian has been 
recognized as a means of interethnic communication, whereas 
Kazakh is the state language. In the republic there are legal 
guarantees preserving the sphere of use of the language of 
interethnic communication and of other languages, and it is 
categorially banned to restrict the rights and freedoms of 
citizens because they do not speak the state language or the 
language of interethnic communication, he stressed. 
  The question of dual citizenship, the president believes, 
could split society, could divide it into "us" and "them." This 
is why we should not resort to introducing dual citizenship in 
the republic. This could breed chaos and mistrust. It is far 
better not to get people worried, but to create within the CIS 
states conditions for free movement and communication; to make 
it possible, for instance, freely to acquire Russian citizenship 
when moving to Russia, and Kazakhstani citizenship when 
returning to Kazakhstan to one's permanent domicile. It would 
be even better if everyone could have a document permitting him 
to live wherever he wants within the confines of the 
commonwealth, Nursultan Nazarbayev said.

  [Excerpts] The Cabinet of Ministers met today. It was 
attended by members of government; leaders of republican 
departments, holding companies, heads of regional 
administratrions, and of Almaty and Leninsk; chairmen of 
territorial committees for state property; and heads of regional 
missions of the National Bank. Under discussion were results of 
socioeconomic development of the republic in 1993 and plans for 
this year's economic policy. 
  Opening the session, Prime Minister Sergey Tershchenko said 
that the country needs to introduce qualitatively new economic 
transformations. He went on to note that the government will 
pursue the policy of supressing inflation, stabilizing the 
economy, and creating an institution of private ownership. 
Everything will be dictated by these main tasks. The minister 
of economy and the first deputy prime minister, Kazhegeldin, 
presented reports. It was stressed that in 1993, stabilization 
of the economy was not achieved. The situation in the economy 
was characterized by a further fall of production and a decline 
in the living standards of the population as well as the general 
instability of economic activity. [passage omitted] 
  In 1993, agricultural production fell by 9.8 percent, while 
construction and assembly work fell by 25 percent. The 
sky-rocketing prices for consumer goods led to a decline in 
people's living standards. Their annual index made up 2,265 
percent. At the same time prices for food increased by 23 
percent, consumer goods by 18 percent, and services provided to 
the population by 41 percent. The production of the main types 
of food decreased as follows: Meat by 12.6 percent, sugar by 
36.1 percent, margarine by 48 percent and vegetable oil by 25.4 
percent. The participants at the meeting spoke after hearing 
the reports. 
  President Nursultan Nazarbayev summarized the results of the 
discussion. He named the specific reasons for decline in 
production. It depends not only on disrupted ties with 
neighboring partners but also on the bad performance of economic 
and management bodies. 
  According to the president the situation in the economy of 
the republic is improving. The most noticeable change in this 
improvement took place last December. We have to analyze the 
reasons for this. At the same time we need to have a clear 
picture of the enteprises which are lagging behind. This year 
will definetely be a difficult and tough year. But we have 
every reason to believe that we can organize our work so as to 
stop falling into economic abyss. Such a clear-cut and precise 
line of government policy should be mandatorial this year. It 
should concentrate its efforts on this. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers adopted a relevant agreement on the 
issues discussed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Amangeldy Akhmetalimov and </F>
Fyodor Ignatov] 
  [Text] Almaty January 25 TASS -- "1994 will be a hard and 
tense year, but we have a chance to make it the last year of 
economic collapse. This policy should be the core of government 
actions," Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev told a 
government meeting here today. The meeting focused on 1993 
social and economic results of Kazakhstan and outlined actions 
for the immediate future. 
  "We have been stating production recession, deterioration of 
financial situation and drop in the living standards for three 
years. The only reason we cited was breaking of economic 
relations between former Soviet republics accompanied with 
payment crisis and increase of the inflation. Generally, it is 
so, but internal processes in the economy and society testify to 
much more," added the president. In his opinion, their quality 
"gives rise to more profound consideration and slightly 
different conclusions". 
  Last year three fourth of enterprises improved their work 
against the background of general production recession. Labor 
collectives of these plants have turned into genuine owners, 
adopted market laws and display independence and business-like 
attitudes. Those who still count on state support are not very 
successful, said the president. He called for more active 
reforms, denationalization and privatization of property. 
  Kazakhstan failed to achieve economic stabilization in 1993. 
Production recession in all material productions and drop in the 
living standards are underway. 
  The gross domestic product reduced by 12.9 per cent as 
compared to 1992. The production output decreased by 16.1 per 
cent, agricultural output by 9.8 per cent and construction works 
- by 25 per cent. 
  Price liberalization without tough financial-budget and 
credit policy did not change much the economic recession 
tendency but resulted in uncontrolled price rise. Prices have 
went up most in the fuel and energy complex, metallurgy, the 
chemical and petrochemical industries. Consumer prices and 
tariffs increased by 23 times. 
  The enormous increase of consumer prices resulted in a drop 
in the living standards. Their 1993 index is 2,265 per cent. 
Foodstuff prices increased by 23 times, prices on consumer goods 
- by 18 times and service tariffs - by 41 times. Stratification 
of the population goes on. Four fifth of the population are on 
the verge of poverty. 
  The government plan for 1994 is expected to help overcome 
the 
economic crisis, said the meeting.

  [Text] Vice President Yerik Asanbayev received the 
ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Kazakhstan at his request 
today. Under examination were prospects for furthering economic 
and cultural relations between our countries. Bilateral 
relations between the two countries are very effective, said 
Yerik Asanbayev. South Korean businessmen have began the 
production of TV sets in Almaty and fridges in Karaganda. 
  However, cooperation has to be boosted especially in the 
sphere of granting Kazakhstan credits. He [Asanbayev] expressed 
certainty that the South Korean side, which has promised to 
grant Kazakhstan with a credit of $350 million, will keep its 
word. The ambassador was thanked for pledging $150,000 in 
humanitarian aid that arrived from Seoul today. 
  The ambassador said that he will do everything so as to 
strengthen friendly ties between the two countries, facilitating 
economic ties, and attracting more investments from South Korea 
to Kazakhstan.

  [Text] Imamali Rakhmanov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of 
the Republic of Tajikistan, paid a short working visit to 
Almaty, yesterday, during which he had a tete-a-tete 
conversation with Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  Nazarbayev and Rakhmanov exchanged views on the situation on 
the Tajik-Afghan border and on ways of reducing the (?tension) 
in this region in an atmosphere of mutual understanding. 
  Kazakhstan's president has evaluated in a positive manner 
the 
Tajik leadership's measures on adjusting the political dialogue 
with the forces of different political orientation aimed at 
seeking peace and concord on Tajik soil. While discussing 
regional issues, the two leaders focused on the necessity of new 
efforts to reinforce the effectiveness of the CIS peacekeeping 
forces. 
  The two leaders have confirmed the invariability of the 
course of both states toward strengthening the independence and 
expanding the traditional friendly relations between Kazakhstan 
and Tajikistan. 
  In a separate meeting, the delegatiions of Kazakhstan and 
Tajikistan discussed a wide range of economic issues, in 
particular on delivery of goods, ways of regulating mutual 
payments, and issues related to energy supply. 
  The government delegations of Kazakhstan and Tajikistan have 
confirmed the joint aspiration for the harmonious and balanced 
development of all-round relations. A number of economic 
intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements were 
concluded at the end of the negotiations.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Skukin report: "One State Duma Deputy Costs 15 </F>
Million Rubles a Month. Is That Not a Lot?"] 
  [Text] On 21 January before leaving for the electoral 
districts, State Duma deputies demonstrated what seemed to me to 
be two important qualities which they have acquired in two weeks 
in parliament: the ability to wage a factional struggle and an 
unexpected capacity for compromise. 
  ...There were two apparently separate questions to be 
resolved: the approval of the composition of the Geopolicy 
Committee and the vote on the inclusion of deputy Andrey Makarov 
in another committee -- the Committee on Legislation. Both 
questions were put to the ballot the day before. Then there was 
a proposal to vote on both questions as a package: We scratch 
your back, you scratch ours. 
  I would venture to suggest that this spectacle was not 
without a certain drama. Suffice it to say that the words 
"motion carried" were heard only after...the fourth vote. The 
breakthrough was achieved in the following manner. Initially 
Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the chamber who was conducting the 
session, admonished the deputies, and not for the first time: 
This attempt to bamboozle one another will get nowhere. He was 
followed by Vladimir Volfovich who said: If you do not approve 
the Geopolicy Committee, what compromise will its nonexistent 
members be able to make? 
  Subsequent events disproved the well known saying that might 
makes right. Thanks to some maneuvering the factions were able 
to elaborate a package of proposals on cadre questions and 
furthermore, according to Deputy Viktor Zorkaltsev, deputy 
chairman of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation 
Central Executive Committee, they will be able to agree on 
specific draft laws. 
  This idea was graphically illustrated by a second episode at 
the session. This was a discussion of a State Duma statement on 
events in Yugoslavia. When the session rejected the proposal by 
Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, member of the International Relations 
Committee, to postpone it until consultations are held with 
representatives of the Foreign Ministry, the question raised 
then was what version of the statement should be adopted: The 
one proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and the Agrarian 
Party of Russia or the version offered by Vladimir Lukin, 
chairman of the International Relations Committee? Here again 
the democrats demonstrated an exceptional tactical flexibility. 
Initially they adopted Lukin's proposal with a paragraph from 
from the alternative draft on lifting the economic blockade 
against Yugoslavia. But then they prevented the inclusion in 
the statement of a paragraph proposed by a representative of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia demanding the withdrawal of 
the UN forces from Yugoslav territory. 
  I asked Gennadiy Burbulis, a "Russia's Choice" deputy, 
whether the interfactional squabbling will not be a hindrance to 
legislative activity and he stated with the utmost clarity: 
There is every reason for separating the political struggle, 
which is inevitable in the State Duma, from the pragmatic 
activity of a parliament consisting of professionals. 
  There is one final event in the State Duma's life which has 
done very little to establish an image for it that is different 
from that of the former Supreme Soviet. The majority lacked the 
strength to resist some tempting privileges. 
  They should not complain from the rostrum about the lack of 
objectivity of the press which latched onto Deputy A. Volkov's 
rejected amendments. Yes, they rejected a remuneration of 
$3,000 and a personal car equipped with a radio. However, at 
the suggestion of S. Baburin, who remembers past privileges, 
they returned to the automobile question and awarded themselves 
a car each but without a radio. 
  Meanwhile, at the same session objections were raised to the 
expansion of State Duma structures. Nevertheless, in addition 
to the State Duma secretariat, which includes the apparatuses of 
the committees, the offices of the chairman and deputy chairmen, 
the State Duma conference, and so forth, the apparatuses of the 
factions and groups of deputies not belonging to the Secretariat 
will also provide backup for the deputies' work. Furthermore, 
each deputy can provide himself with a whole staff of assistants 
-- up to five people. And all this is at the taxpayer's 
expense....

  [Text] Vladimir Lukin has been elected the head of the 
State Duma Committee for International Affairs. He was a former 
Russian ambassador to the United States. How can the State Duma 
influence the formulation of Russian foreign policy? More from 
our parliamentary correspondent, who interviewed Vladimir Lukin. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Primarily, under the 
Constitution, the State Duma shall or shall not ratify 
international treaties concluded on behalf of the country. The 
State Duma also approves of the foreign policy articles in the 
budget. Besides, under the Constitution, the State Duma will 
agree upon Russia's ambassadors to foreign countries' 
appointments and withdrawals. 
  We shall see to it that these responsible posts are filled 
with the persons who can respectfully present Russia's 
interests, said Vladimir Lukin. When asked to respond if he had 
shared the viewpoint that the Russian Foreign Ministry paid 
insufficient attention to the Asia and Pacific region, he said 
that this is exactly so. A foreign policy is first and foremost 
the accomplishment of specific results, significant to the 
country concerned. From this point of view, our Asiatic 
policies do leave much to be desired. 
  He goes on to say that Russia's foreign minister, Andrey 
Kozyrev, is to visit China shortly. I wish his visit could 
produce good results. And in his final remarks, Vladimir Lukin 
stressed that we would need specific accomplishments in the 
foreign policy we pursued, and this would relate not only to 
China, but to other Asian countries as well.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- A concept of the draft 
law "On Political Parties" was criticized today by the majority 
of speakers at hearings of the Russian president's commission 
for legislative proposals. 
  The five-page concept gives the notion of "an all-Russian 
political party", specifies conditions of party formation and 
registration, enumerates party rights and control over party 
activities. 
  The majority of party representatives opposed an idea to 
describe a party as all-Russian only in case of "its support by 
over five per cent of voters in the state Duma elections" and a 
strength of no less than 5,000 members. The commission 
suggested to consider all- Russian only the parties represented 
in the parliament although many of them won the elections within 
larger electoral coalitions. 
  The idea was most severely criticized by parties that did 
not 
gain the five per cent of votes at the recent elections -- the 
Constitutional-Democratic Party, the Conservative Party, the 
Party of Consolidation, the Socialist Party of Working People, 
the National-Republican Party and others. 
  Deputy Russian Labor Minister Vladimir Varov said the 
document is "a worst concept of draft laws discussed by the 
former Supreme Soviet". In his opinion, the body registering a 
party should proceed from party deeds and not its rules or other 
documents which may be written in a way to meet all the 
criteria. "Otherwise, we will soon have dozens of paramilitary 
organizations named `parties'," he stressed. 
  Leader of the Association of Russian Independent 
Professionals Pyotr Filippov called for "application of tougher 
norms to political parties". In his opinion, all parties -- 
including those which exceeded the five per cent limit and those 
which did not -- should constantly confirm their right to 
existence. He said regular re-registration of party members is 
necessary.

<F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of Communist Party </F>
of Russian Federation faction in State Duma, under 
"Parliamentary Process -- View from Factions" rubric: "Start of 
Duma"] 
  [Text] The first, organizational stage of the State Duma 
sessions is over. The deputies have gone their separate ways 
for a week to work in their electoral districts. The official 
mass media have made the maximum effort to portray the Duma's 
first days as an all-Russia slanging match and a struggle of 
egoistic ambitions, to discredit it in the public consciousness, 
and, to be frank, to prepare the ground for its speediest 
dissolution. 
  The reason for such zeal is understandable. The regime, 
which convened the Duma as a cover designed to legalize the 
results of the coup d'etat, obtained as a result of the 
elections something qualitatively different, which does not fit 
in with its plans. It has no need of such a parliament, and the 
first act in the struggle against the Duma was a psychological 
war against it on the air and in the pages of the press. 
Everything is being done to conceal from the electorate the 
true meaning of the work that has been done. Therefore, it is 
important to understand its actual meaning. 
  For 10 days a very hard struggle was being waged to ensure 
the Duma's capacity for work -- to make it as difficult as 
possible for particular groupings inside and outside the Duma to 
block and thwart its activity by means of a boycott, procedural 
ruses, the fueling of organizational muddle, etc. It was in 
order to prevent such phenomena that a low quorum needed to open 
the sessions was set; it was made difficult to delay matters by 
arranging secret votes on any pretext; an obstacle was put in 
the way of the fragmentation of the corps of deputies into a 
mass of small and very small factions; and a small Duma Council 
was formed, consisting of just 10 members and, consequently, 
arriving more quickly at agreed decisions. All this has already 
yielded the first fruits and made it possible quite promptly to 
elect the chairman and his deputies and to form the Duma 
committees. On the whole, it can be said that the Duma promises 
to be an organ that is perfectly capable of working. 
  Thus, an important point, but still not the decisive one, 
has 
been passed in the Duma's development as an organ of real state 
power. It is capable of adopting principled decisions, but will 
the decisions of the Duma (and the Federal Assembly as a whole) 
have a substantial impact on the state of affairs in the 
country? According to the text of the Constitution, which the 
Central Electoral Commission hastened to proclaim adopted, the 
rights and powers of parliament have been curtailed to such an 
extent that they are, in point of fact, not even legislative but 
advisory. On behalf of the so-called "legislative proposals 
commission under the president" the Duma was presented with a 
107-point plan of legislative activity whose adoption would mean 
parliament vegetating for many years in complete isolation from 
reality and from the real needs and requirements of society and 
the state. The fact that the Duma brushed that plan aside 
attests to its state responsibility. 
  It is undoubtedly necessary to develop the legislative base. 
But it is perfectly clear to any unbiased observer that the 
country's present problems lie in a somewhat different plane. 
We are suffering not from a deficit of laws but from a deficit 
of legality, when none of the existing laws is seriously being 
fulfilled and, most dangerously, an example is being set here by 
the top executive structures headed by the president, which 
descended to a coup d'etat and crude armed violence against 
law-abiding citizens. The question now stands as follows: 
Either legality will be restored or the country will sink 
deeper and deeper into the quagmire of economic catastrophe and 
smouldering civil war, which threatens at any moment to escalate 
into a full-scale war. 
  It was in order to try to restore legality by peaceful, 
nonviolent means that the opposition entered the Duma in full 
awareness of the fact that the entire post-October political 
structure was lacking a strong legal foundation. Consequently, 
it is a question not of a submissive existence under conditions 
imposed by force but of a need to radically change these 
conditions. This objective need can be formulated as follows: 
the restoration of effective parliamentary control over the 
executive structures -- presidential, government, and any 
others. At the same time it is necessary to sustain the 
principle that the greater the powers of the executive, the more 
rigid and scrupulous must be the legislature's control over 
them. This not only does not contradict the principle of the 
separation of powers but, on the contrary, stems directly from 
it. 
  The legislative determination of the composition, structure, 
and size of funding of executive organs, the approval of 
candidacies for ministers and other top officials, the regular 
hearing of reports on the activities of ministries and 
departments, the holding, where necessary, of investigations -- 
all this is the inalienable prerogative of parliament and of its 
committees and commissions with a normal democratic procedure of 
state management and must become part of Russian political 
practice. This virtually means an objective need to adopt a new 
constitution. 
  Is the Duma (Federal Assembly) ready to take serious steps 
in 
the said direction? Taking into account the substantial 
political heterogeneity of the corps of deputies, obviously a 
return to legality will not be a one-off act but will require 
persistent efforts to form a responsible state majority in the 
Duma and for it to win public trust and support. In our view, 
the platform for its consolidation must be an understanding of 
the disastrous nature of the present socioeconomic policy, 
protection for Russia's fundamental national-state interests, 
and the desire to establish genuine people's power in the 
country and the fatherland's spiritual revival. 
  For its part the deputies' faction of the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation will strive to ensure that the Duma 
adopts decisions on a number of fundamental questions. 
  It is necessary to investigate and make a political 
assessment of the events of 21 September through 4 October last 
year and their consequences and to adopt legislative acts aimed 
at preventing anything similar ever again. The circumstances 
and consequences of the illegal Belovezhskaya Forest compact 
must similarly be analyzed. 
  A very important task of parliament by way of restoring 
legality is also to examine the question of the lawfulness of 
the interpretation of the voting results of 12 December 1993 as 
the electorate's adoption of the draft constitution proposed in 
B. Yeltsin's name. It is our conviction that such an 
interpretation is unlawful. So many very gross violations of 
the Constitution and the Referendum Law were committed in the 
course of preparing and "adopting" that draft that they 
constitute perfectly adequate grounds for repealing the Central 
Electoral Commission's decision and resuming the constitutional 
process by means, for example, of scheduling a general election 
to the Constitutional Assembly. 
  The period which the country is going through is a typical 
example of what is called a suspension of law, when legitimacy 
finds itself in question, i.e. the legal succession of all the 
branches of power without exception, including, of course, the 
Federal Assembly itself. In our view, the legality of 
parliament can be interpreted only from the viewpoint of the 
need for the country to return to the channel of rule-of-law 
development and the maintenance of civilian peace. Those 
actions -- and only those actions of it -- which are aimed at 
achieving the said goal can be considered lawful. This goal 
also determines the extent of the Duma's powers needed to 
realize it. The source of these powers is the direct expression 
of the electorate's will, certainly not Edict No. 1400, as 
frequent attempts are made to portray the matter. 
  All these juridical niceties might at first sight seem to 
have no direct bearing on the country's real needs in its 
present catastrophic state. It must be understood, however, 
that without an increase in the rights and powers of parliament 
it will be unable to make a real contribution to the cause of 
surmounting the crisis, and any initiatives by it will remain 
just good intentions. 
  This does not mean, however, that urgent socioeconomic 
problems have remained outside our attention. The Communists' 
faction has its own plan of legislative initiatives on a wide 
range of issues. These are, above all, draft laws aimed at 
replacing the policy of reforms and protecting the Russian 
economy: on labor collectives, taxation, price formation, the 
destatization of ownership (as an alternative to privatization), 
investment policy, and support for the agro-industrial complex. 
State support for science, culture, education, and health care 
and material and moral protection for the family, motherhood, 
and childhood require special attention. Extraordinary measures 
are needed to combat corruption and crime, particularly street 
crime. 
  Any government which seriously intends to work in this area 
will receive our vote of confidence. But first a government 
program with a clear indication of the specific goals and the 
approximate deadlines for realizing them and with calculations 
of the funds necessary for this must be published, receive an 
expert appraisal in parliamentary committees, be discussed in 
detail, and, finally, be approved by the Duma. Only in this 
case does parliament have the right to give its consent to the 
appointment of the head of government and other officials, and 
only on this condition can it bear responsibility for the 
country's situation. 
  Maybe a different way of conducting state affairs, which was 
practised hitherto, the method of backstage infighting and 
intriguing, creates an illusion of autocratic power, but in 
practice it has led and does lead to increased chaos and 
arbitrariness, when crude violence remains the only argument in 
a dispute, and this, as is known, is a highly unreliable and 
short-lived instrument for resolving complex tasks. 
  This is not the first time Russia has experienced such a 
situation. Every time the executive's stubborn reluctance to 
cooperate with the representative power and to submit to 
parliamentary control has led, in the final analysis, to very 
grave social upheavals. The last time, this happened literally 
before our eyes. The collapse of the great power, bloody 
conflicts, economic disaster, the unprecedented degrading of 
national and state dignity -- do these cruel realities really 
not serve as an adequate argument in favor of choosing a 
different path of cooperation among public forces and among the 
branches of state power? 
  The first days of the Duma's work have created the 
impression 
that there are forces in it which are capable of responding to 
reasonable arguments. Despite all their heterogeneity, they 
will be able to cooperate if they regard the interests of the 
whole state and the whole people as of paramount importance. It 
would be better for those who are not capable of this to leave 
the political stage voluntarily, without waiting for tough 
circumstances and the people's indignation to force them to do 
so.

probably, the question of moving the lower chamber from the 
building of the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance to 
a new location will be decided today. The same source has made 
it known that the most probable destination for the Duma is in 
southeast Moscow, in the building of Moscow's Academy of 
Management. Incidentally, this option was discussed during the 
meeting between President Yeltsin and Speaker Rybkin last week 
after Mr. Rybkin came in for criticism from the leaders of Duma 
factions for his excessive pliancy.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Jan -- Officers of the Black Sea Fleet 
and their families are in a calamitous state, says a letter from 
the Coordinating Council of Officers' Assemblies to Russia's 
State Duma. The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned about the 
contents of the message in the Black Sea fleet press center 
today. 
  The officers voice their concern over allowance payments 
being two months in arrears, in view of increases in inflation. 
The document also draws attention to the fact that children of 
servicemen in the fleet cannot go to Ukraine's civilian higher 
education colleges, because they do not speak Ukrainian. 
  The Coordinating Council is also concerned, the letter says, 
that the proposal by the officers' assemblies for the Black Sea 
fleet to be granted the status of the Russian Federation fleet 
has not yet been considered at the state level.

in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies: In his introduction, 
chairman of the Supreme Council, Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch, gave 
some brief information about the order, procedure, and the 
passage of this document [draft constitution] and also of 
documents that were examined here in the Supreme Council, 
including the draft constitution. You will recall that after 
the concept of the constitution was adopted, I first made a 
speech when the constitution was submitted for nationwide 
discussion for the first time and then the second speech was 
made by Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch. Thus, according to the 
constitution, three speeches were made: one on the concept, and 
two on the draft of the constitution itself. Thus, we may say 
that the Supreme Council and the commission on elaborating the 
new constitution which it created worked actively for two years. 
A large number of proposals were received. Some of them were 
taken into account and more than 2,000 proposals were received 
after it was published. If one were to give a short description 
of them, they relate to the problems of organizing power and 
most of them relate to the problem of the territorial 
organization of power and local self-government. 
  The main aim of preparing the adoption of documents which we 
are now discussing lies in the urgency of improving and 
stabilizing the system of organizing power that is naturally an 
indivisible condition for further political and economic reforms 
in Ukraine: the creation of a stable legal basis for the 
activity of the Supreme Council of the new convocation and other 
bodies of power, and the speeding up of the constitutional 
process and finalizing work on the new constitution of Ukraine. 
The form of the adoption of this document by means of a 
referendum establishes firm legal foundations for the legitimate 
and evolutionary process of organizing power structures, holding 
it with the agreement of the highest bearer of power: the people 
of Ukraine. Without doubt this will become an important 
condition of accord, social peace, and partnership in our 
society. 
  Other ways of resolving constitutional issues were examined 
at an extended session of the constitutional commission. In 
particular the talk was about the possibility of working out a 
mechanism for elaborating the draft new constitution of Ukraine 
and submitting it as a whole to a referendum. The talk was 
about the possibility of the Supreme Council again directly 
adopting a constitution and about a Ukraine-wide referendum 
adopting a prepared draft law on the organization of authority 
in Ukraine. Documents were submitted, I repeat, on all of these 
aspects, and were discussed. But it was agreed that the most 
legitimate and productive path is for the Supreme Council to 
approve the basis for constitutional principles and for it to be 
submitted to a referendum. 
  And now briefly about the content of the document submitted: 
It is based on principles determined by the Declaration of State 
Sovereignty of Ukraine and on the corresponding principles of 
the new draft constitution of Ukraine, which, as has already 
been said here, have been frequently examined in this hall. The 
fundamental constitutional clauses contain guiding principles 
and powers and mechanisms of restraint and counterbalance, which 
make it possible to create an efficient system of organizing 
state authority and local self-government. 
  It is also important that they provide answers to questions, 
which people's deputies and representatives of local bodies of 
authority are proposing and have proposed be put to the 
referendum in a separate bloc. That is, questions on 
constitutional order, on the form of state government, and on 
the territorial organization of power and local self-government. 
That is, this document, in our opinion, resolves the 
fundamental issue as a whole. It does not tear them away from 
the general political and state context and does not create an 
atmosphere of social tension in society. 
  The substance of the fundamental constitutional clauses 
gives 
grounds for determining a democratic, lawful, and social nature 
of the state and social order, where universal values are 
determined without any "-isms"; the priority of human rights and 
freedoms are also determined this way, as are political, 
economic, and ideological variety and equal protection for all 
forms of ownership in a socially oriented market economy. The 
fundamental clauses establish elements of the form of government 
that are the most acceptable under current conditions by 
determining the authority of the branches of power, and these 
clauses determine the territorial system and territorial 
organization of power, specifically unitary decentralized power. 
  As you see, the document is composed of seven chapters, the 
first of which deals with the general basis of the organization 
of state power and local self-government, proceeding in 
particular from the principles of democracy, the supremacy of 
law, and the division of state power into its legislative, 
executive, and judicial branches. These principles are further 
developed and enforcibly realized in the draft's further 
chapters. 
  The second, third, fourth, and fifth chapters contain the 
main provisions on the status, plenary powers, functional mutual 
relations, and organization of central branches and 
establishments of state legislative, executive, and judicial 
power, as well as the plenary powers of the Ukrainian president. 
  The second chapter emphasizes that the people exercise 
legislative power by way of an all-Ukrainian referendum and that 
the only body of legislative power, that functions permanently, 
is the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian parliament. Also 
determined here are the main legislative, institutional 
supervisory functions, and plenary powers of the Supreme 
Council, its capabilities in respect of the operation of 
budgetary and taxation policies, appointment, and election of 
the president, and his impeachment, formation of the government, 
etc. 
  The draft's third chapter establishes the status of the 
Ukrainian president as the head of state, who is removed from 
the system of executive power and placed with various branches 
of power, acting in relation to all of them as a guarantor to 
ensure that the Constitution of Ukraine is abided by, human and 
civic rights and freedoms are complied with and state unity, 
sovereignty, and the national security and territorial integrity 
of Ukraine are preserved. It is in connection with this that 
the relevant functions and plenary powers are also vested in the 
president. 
  The fourth chapter defines the system of executive power in 
Ukraine and the status of the supreme organ of state executive 
power, the Cabinet of Ministers, that is accountable and 
responsible to the Supreme Council and is under the Ukrainian 
president's control. The preparation of this chapter was based 
on the need to raise the level of the government's independence 
and strengthen executive power and discipline at every level in 
all. 
  The fifth chapter, as you see, is on the subject of an 
authoritative system of judicial power. 
  A separate provision in the draft's sixth chapter is on the 
territorial reorganization of power and local self-government. 
It is about this, as has already been said, that discussions 
were particularly acute. This chapter's agreed version proceeds 
from the direction of the territorial organization of power and 
local self-government toward uniting state, regional, and local 
interests under the unitary decentralized construction of a 
single system of Ukraine's territorial structure. 
  This is particularly pressing because of the situation which 
today surrounds the Crimean issue. It is completely 
understandable that it cannot be further left undefined. That 
is why section six outlines the status of the Crimean Republic 
on the principles of autonomy, of Kiev as the capital of 
Ukraine, and Sevastopol as a city that has a general state 
significance, bodies of state power of the Crimean Republic, and 
bodies of local self-government. Local interests will be 
represented by heads of oblast, rayon, and town and village 
councils that will be directly elected by the population and 
will be headed officially by the executive bodies of the 
appropriate councils. In order to avoid centrifugal and 
separatist tendencies and also with the aim of strengthening 
executive discipline on issues of powers delegated by the state, 
they will be answerable to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 
In the event of a blatant violation of Ukraine's constitution 
or legislative acts they may be removed from their posts. 
  Cases are envisaged when the powers of the Supreme Council 
of 
the Crimean Republic and also of respective local councils may 
be terminated ahead of time by Ukraine's Supreme Council. This 
relates to the adoption of decisions directed at violating the 
territorial integrity of Ukraine, an arbitrary change in its 
state territorial system, the blatant violation of Ukraine's 
Constitution and laws, and not bringing their own decisions in 
line with them. 
  The draft's final seventh chapter points out that this 
document lays the foundation of the completion of work on 
Ukraine's new constitution and that the organs of state power 
and local self-government across the whole territory of Ukraine 
are formed after the fundamental constitutional provisions are 
brought into effect, which is quite essential in order to 
understand and overcome the differences between the current 
constitution and this document which will be implemented as 
relevant laws are worked out and Ukraine's new constitution is 
adopted. 
  As for the possibility of the issues of state symbols, 
citizenship, linguistic policy, and so on being included in the 
fundamental constitutional provisions, this was the subject of 
every session. All of them are undoubtedly very important and 
of consequence and cannot be ignored. We all very well know, 
however, that there is no uniform perception of them today in 
various regions of Ukraine. Including them in the fundamental 
provisions and putting them up for a referendum -- on top of all 
this at the time of holding the elections -- can lead to 
exacerbating the political struggle and further increasing 
enmity in society. That is why raising these issues now is 
inexpedient. They could well be settled either in a new 
constitution or constitutional legislation which will be dealt 
with by a newly-composed Supreme Council. 
  Since the fundamental constitutional provisions on the 
reorganization of state power and local self-government in 
Ukraine have also been appropriately approved, endorsed, and 
recommended for a decision to be taken on them, with approval 
given by the conference of councils at all levels, and are based 
on the provisions of the draft new constitution of Ukraine, it 
is proposed that a discussion should be held about them, that 
changes and amendments, if any of course, should be introduced 
and that then the decision drafted should be taken. 
  In view of this, we have every ground to propose this 
document and include it in a referendum at the time of the 
elections on 27 March 1994. 
  Esteemed People's Deputies: Here in this hall, fateful and 
some of the most responsible decisions were made. I hope that, 
its historical mission taken into consideration, the Supreme 
Council today will, on the basis of its experience, open a new 
page in the development of nation-building in Ukraine, of new 
prospects, treating their electorate with great respect and 
enabling them to make their conclusive pronouncement on the 
organization of power in Ukraine. Thank you for attention.

<F P=106> [President Leonid Kravchuk question and answer session with </F>
deputies following his speech at a session of the Supreme 
Council in Kiev -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Deputy Chernyavskyy] Deputy Chernyavskyy, 
electoral district 352. Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. I think 
that the question is to Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch, too. Isn't 
there a contradiction in the fourth, fifth, and eighth points of 
chapter six on chairmen of councils of the relevant level -- 
when they are elected by the people -- but here the issue comes 
up that they are subordinate to the appropriate council. 
[passage omitted] One can be elected by the people, but removed 
from one's post by the president. With all due respect to the 
president, well, that is, one can be removed not by those bodies 
and people by whom they were elected. 
  [Kravchuk] I think that there should always be some kind of 
mechanism. Well, for example, the question did not occur to you 
that the president is elected by the people, but the Supreme 
Council can remove him from his post by means of impeachment or 
by submitting the issue to a referendum. Such a question has 
not occurred. It did not occur. So why does the question occur 
here -- one is elected by the people, but if the person violates 
the Constitution, violates laws, and in that part especially 
where the state delegates functions for him to carry out, then 
naturally the representative body cannot remain without reacting 
to these matters, and neither can the government remain aloof 
from this if we truly want to create a strong and responsible 
executive authority. Therefore I think that a counterbalance 
should always be there, and the person should know that there is 
some kind of lever forcing him either to work responsibly or he 
will be removed from his post. 
  [Deputy Starichenko] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. 
Starichenko, Donetsk oblast. I have a question which perturbs 
my electors. We are submitting the basis of the constitution 
for examination and (?without) the main issue, which we have 
taken away from our electors, which was in the old constitution. 
That is the right of the individual to labor, to free 
education, the right to free health care and so on and so forth. 
The question is why the said issue has not been submitted in 
this basis. 
  [Kravchuk] I share this point of view and the concern of 
your 
electors. For in our time we removed an entire 23 chapters from 
the constitution then in force, and now these clauses are not in 
our constitution either. That is, the present Supreme Council 
has removed them from the constitution. But they were in this 
constitution. But we, until now...[pauses] what is the law 
called? On the fundamentals, the fundamental constitutional 
principles regarding the organization of state authority and 
local self-government. That is, we have taken a narrow issue, 
which will be set out in the relevant chapters of the 
constitution. But the Supreme Council, which will be convened, 
I am convinced that it will, these chapters, and incidentally 
they are in the draft constitution too, but maybe not in this 
wording, but the Supreme Council will be adopting the 
constitution as a whole, and these chapters will find a place 
there without fail. 
  [Unidentified deputy] I'm sorry, but this situation -- 
because that which I spoke about is not here -- these clauses, 
this situation could cause people simply not to come to the 
electoral districts to vote. Because they want to see in the 
constitution namely that which they had, and that which we want 
to take away from them now. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this also depends on us. If we explain to 
people that everything is not determined by this law or by the 
fundamental principles, then other issues have to be taken into 
account too. (?We have taken) a narrow issue. But they will 
certainly be in the constitution. But the Supreme Council can 
adopt this too, because this is the most acute issue, and as a 
rule the most acute debates occur regarding this. 
  [Deputy Stepenko] Stepenko, electoral district 330. Leonid 
Makarovych, I have a brief question for you. Here in the second 
chapter, the second sub-point, the paragraph where it says that 
the Supreme Council works on a permanent basis, there is an 
omission in the second version. Is this a misprint or is it 
really an omission and is parliament going to work on a 
nonprofessional basis? And another question. Here, well we say 
that a strong presidential authority is needed. [passage 
omitted] But look, the president does not appoint or sack the 
Cabinet of Ministers. [passage omitted] And the last question 
-- on the last page -- the issue was discussed whereby the 
chairmen of oblast, rayon, and settlement councils are directly 
elected by the people and head the executive authority. But the 
directors of executive authority -- I am making this additional 
proposal -- are elected at council sessions, that is, to exclude 
personal appointments, which lead to servility and so on. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, first about the professional nature of 
parliament. The present Supreme Council adopted a decision by 
means of a law that the parliament is a professional one and it 
has made an appropriate change to the constitution. It is 
already in the constitution. It is already in the constitution. 
We have not submitted everything. I repeat again. These are 
details here. Everything that has already been decided today is 
decided. As regards power and structure, we did not put it in 
this draft. That is the first thing. The second question 
concerned a strong executive authority and there being a link 
between strong executive authority and the president. In this 
draft, and we all agreed on this, the constitutional commission 
and council representatives agreed, that executive authority is 
fully concentrated in the hands of the Cabinet of Ministers. 
And it is entirely natural that if the prime minister is 
responsible for executive authority, then we should give him the 
right to form the government with which he wants to work. But 
we also give the Supreme Council the right to express no 
confidence in him or to propose another way, and then he leaves 
his post and forms another government. If the president is 
again going to be directly involved in these issues, then he 
must assume executive authority. 
  This cannot be. Then a prime minister is not needed. One 
thing only is needed. That is why we agreed on this version. 
  As for what you propose regarding the directors of executive 
authority, I think that this can be resolved by a certain 
clause. This does not necessarily have to be put into these 
fundamentals. 
  [Deputy Marchenko] Marchenko, electoral district 347. 
[passage omitted] I am asking you one question, only one. Would 
you not agree for a third time to be true to your right of 
legislative initiative and submit to a referendum only one 
question -- on the need for the institution of the presidency in 
Ukraine? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, I understand that this is the stance of 
your 
party. For your party the president is now an eyesore, let us 
say, in Ukraine. You want this issue put to a referendum. But 
the Supreme Council adopted corresponding decisions. And I am 
guided by the decisions of the Supreme Council and not by the 
decisions of individual deputies. There is a decision adopted 
by this body on the referendum. Then they revoked it and 
adopted a decision on preterm elections of the Supreme Council 
and new elections of the president. What contradictions are 
there here? The time will come, and there will be elections. 
But you again want a referendum on whether a president is 
needed. It is not about the name of the president, but about a 
concrete figure, about the structure of power. If the people do 
not vote for these fundamental constitutional clauses, then 
imagine -- then the Supreme Council of the new convocation will 
adopt the decision it considers necessary, and on the 
institution of the presidency in Ukraine too, and on the nature 
of power too. But this will then mean that the people do not 
want such a structure and put themselves in the hands of the 
Supreme Council of the new convocation. But you want to again 
return to the issue of a referendum. 
  [Deputy Petrenko] Volodymyr Petrenko for Azov Electoral 
District 195. [passage omitted] Following the logic of what is 
written -- and I, for example, am not happy about -- I am also 
going to vote -- I am not happy about paragraph 2 of Chapter 4, 
Executive Power: The supreme organ of state executive power in 
Ukraine is the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 
  This is a collective body, whereas I would like a prime 
minister to head executive power. Thus, only because of one 
paragraph will I vote entirely against the whole of the 
fundamental provisions. 
  So my proposal -- and I would like to know your view on that 
one -- is that we should remove these fundamental provisions 
because we are adopting this package when there is not yet a new 
parliament. Seventy percent of us will not be there. There will 
be new people who will have their vision but who will not, 
however, have the freedom of maneuver because people will have 
voted on this. Thank you for your attention. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, I would like you to listen to what I think. 
I cannot see, for example, how the whole of executive power can 
be vested in the sole person of the prime minister given that he 
as a person is appointed by the Supreme Council. Executive 
power has to concentrate in the Cabinet of Ministers as a body, 
while the prime minister -- it is there further on, do have a 
look under what the prime minister can do -- heads this power 
and heads the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, forming the 
government and the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers and 
exercising control over the Cabinet of Ministers, coordinating 
and so on. In other words, the organ itself represents 
executive power and the premier is at the head of it. So what 
you are saying is there, and I cannot see any differences here. 
However, the person is not elected democratically, but 
appointed, so do you really want the whole of full executive 
power to be given to one person? In that case, what is the role 
of the government? That is to say, this has to be explained, as 
simple as that, just explained. [passage omitted] 
  [Deputy Charodeyev, in Russian] Charodeyev for Donetsk's 
Proletarskiy rayon. [passage omitted] The question is this: 
Leonid Makarovych, I am carefully watching what you are saying 
now and you said earlier that the questions on bilingualism and 
state symbols could not be put up to a referendum, saying that 
this question was unconstitutional. In many civilized countries, 
this is a constitutional question. Where the leadership is wise 
and makes the right decisions, it does so without a referendum. 
Here the question is ripe. [passage omitted] Maybe the people 
in the east will see that the majority in Ukraine is in favor of 
this -- if it is in favor -- and maybe they will calm down. 
Believe me, there is the total unacceptance of either the 
symbols or monolingualism, and not only in eastern Ukraine. 
There are letters from western Ukraine, in Ukrainian, that to 
us, yellow has always been the color of harlots, traitors, and 
the soft-headed. 
  That is why it is a referendum, rather than [Pavlo] Movchan 
or [Larysa] Skoryk [both pro-Ukrainian people's deputies], that 
can resolve this question. If you think there will be dangerous 
consequences, tell me what they are. I would sincerely like to 
make this issue clear to myself. I, however, will prove in a 
speech that you are mistaken being under pressure from Rukh 
people and unscrupulous advisers. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, you know, if we cannot reach a decision 
here, given that we have not been able to reach it since May 
1990, this is because there are different points of view. 
However, under enforcible enactments and the procedure of work 
of the Supreme Council, decisions here are made by a majority of 
votes and nobody makes any distinction between deputies from the 
West or East voting. It is a majority, period. 
  Now, imagine such a scene -- we have already seen it and 
here; I am not making anything up; it has already happened -- as 
Ukraine's western regions voting for the yellow and blue flag 
and the east -- I do not know what for and I will not make any 
forecasts now -- and they then (?secede). Then it is not that 
the deputies cast their votes at the Supreme Council as a body, 
that will be said. There will be a territorial division as to 
who voted for what flag. You will say that by a majority this 
flag should be hoisted here and you are bound, bound, to cause 
confrontation. This is first. 
  Second, as democrats -- please listen, this is an important 
issue, and it will anyway have to be settled... 
  [Plyushch interrupts and trys to restore order] 
  [Kravchuk] As real democrats, the issue in general and the 
formulation of the issue on the state language, as it is, is 
absurd, i.e. it fails to withstand any criticism. In this case, 
however, it is about supporting the state language. That is all. 
That is why I cannot see why this issue should be included in 
the constitution. This can be settled by a law on languages. 
This law exists, by the way, and it can be worked out, corrected 
and adopted in the form the Supreme Council deems necessary. 
This is a democratic way. But to impose on the people and divide 
them according to the linguistic determinant will simply be 
dangerous for the state, trust me, and passions will all the 
time be inflamed over this, whether you want it or not. The 
thing is that there is the situation that is in existence in 
Ukraine today. That is why what I am saying about this is that 
there is no need to include [the issues of state symbols and 
bilingualism] in the constitution, moreover by a referendum. 
Settle it by a law and everything will be all right. Perhaps the 
Supreme Council will consider that two or three official 
languages are spoken in Ukraine, Ukrainian, Russian and some 
other. 
  [Plyushch] The second microphone. 
  [Deputy Romanov] Romanov for Odessa's District 294. [passage 
omitted] We have a document called the Declaration on the 
Sovereignty of Ukraine, where it is written down that the 
declaration is the basis of a new constitution. We have now 
prepared another document, which is the [fundamental 
constitutional] provisions, that are also the basis of Ukraine's 
new constitution. 
  My understanding is that the adoption of a [new] 
constitution 
will be carried out by a new Supreme Council. That is why, so 
that there would not be variant readings, and since it will be 
the basis of a new constitution, I think it would be all right 
to write the following clause -- I would like to know your 
attitude toward this -- in the general provisions, which is 
Chapter 1 -- so that we then would not be accused of anything: 
The right -- in Paragraph 4 -- the right to work, education, 
scientific development, and environmental protection shall be 
ensured for the future generations. If we do not write this 
down, anything can happen after a referendum. 
  And the next question: In Chapter 5 on judiciary power, 
nothing is said on the role of the office of the procurator. My 
opinion is that this particular issue should by all means be 
elucidated. The issue of the responsibility of the organs of 
power for violations of the current legislation should also be 
elucidated. What is your attitude towards these chapters? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, first of all let us assume the right to 
everything you say is ensured. Ensured by whom? The state? 
For everybody? Well, in that case, we have to say one more 
thing, which is that there shall not be, shall we say, any 
insurance medicine or any private colleges. No, no, no, no -- 
wait, wait, wait. Once we are saying A, we have to say B. That 
is to say, the state in accordance with the budget takes it upon 
itself fully to finance and ensure social security, which is how 
it used to be. 
  Let us talk openly: Is it realistic in transition to a 
market, socially oriented economy? 
  The next question to you then is this: I am not just saying 
that we should write it down. Anything can be written and paper 
will cope with it, but if we write down unrealistic things we 
will simply ... [responding to a call from the audience and 
changing thought] What you are saying is correct, but what you 
have following this is another course of the development of our 
society. Let us then write down that we are returning to the 
old styles of work and to the old system of labor and 
everything, and this all can then be written down. 
  That is why I would like to say this: If the Supreme Council 
... [pauses] Why is it important that this issue should be 
examined by the Supreme Council? It is because it will weigh up 
every situation and will specify it and can differentiate 
something -- I do not know. 
  It cannot just be written down for the state then to say: I 
have no base to do so, our economy is different. Throughout the 
world, human beings have the right to use their talents, their 
capabilities and conditions, rather than having it immediately 
provided at any cost. You will not find it to be the case 
anywhere. 
  So let us now take a realistic look at things. If you are 
now in favor of this course, then finally say how you formulate 
it and what we are to vote for. 
  [Plyushch] There was the office of the procurator. We agreed 
that by a law on the office of the procurator... 
  [Kravchuk, interrupting] The office of the procurator -- it 
is moved outside judiciary power. Our office of the procurator 
is separate, it is to be established by a law on the office of 
the procurator. You know that it is not included in the system 
of judiciary power. Then a separate chapter will be needed. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified deputy] I have several questions: Why are the 
fundamental constitutional provisions on the organization of 
state power prepared so as to suit a personality, a personality, 
rather than the state and the people? Let us so far consider 
them to suit you as president and some... 
  [Kravchuk, interrupting] Can you be more specific? 
  [Deputy] I can say specifically... 
  [Kravchuk] Please. 
  [Deputy] This is the first question: Why is it that you are 
elected for five years and the parliament for four? 
  [Kravchuk] You are welcome. First [words undistinct]... 
  [Deputy, interrupting] Why is it that you elect the judges 
and we approve them? [passage omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] My explanation is this: If it is about the 
election of the president for four years, I am ready today to 
alter the number of years, and by the way, it was not I who put 
it forward. 
  Second, about why it is me who proposes the judges [passage 
indistinct] why the president does the proposing is because 
every society has to have counterweights. If it is the Supreme 
Council that does the electing, then someone must do the putting 
forward. You may not elect someone who is proposed, and the 
president will have to put forward another candidacy. However, 
it cannot be that an organ grabs everything. Let us say the 
Supreme Council and president are elected democratically, right? 
Why should one organ have more rights, more functions, more 
powers, and more levers to exert pressure than the other who is 
also someone elected democratically? One does the putting 
forward and the other does the voting. There are not any 
discrepancies here. 
  [Deputy] I have a second question. A second question. Do 
you agree in accordance with your statement on re-election as 
president in June? 
  [Kravchuk] The Supreme Council has adopted a resolution on 
this. 
  [Deputy] Are there going to be elections or not? 
  [Kravchuk] Do I really decide this? The Supreme Council 
decides this. Why are you addressing me? The issue has already 
been resolved. Make a correction [as heard]. I repeat, the 
Supreme Council commission, Oleksandr Pavlovych is right here. 
I read it today. The draft has been distributed to you -- vote 
for it. I cannot vote for the Supreme Council. Kozarenko there 
is saying that this is not in the constitution. The Supreme 
Council adopted a resolution from my proposal. And the Supreme 
Council should secure this. 
  [Deputy Tkachuk] Anatoliy Tkachuk from the town of 
Khmelnitskiy. Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. Please tell me, to 
this first question, do you believe that when two documents 
exist in Ukraine, namely one document voted for at a referendum 
and a second document called the Constitution of Ukraine, and 
which is referred to here, that this eliminates turmoil in the 
hall? In my view, this will only increase turmoil. This is the 
first question. And the second question: please tell me, have 
you made a psychological analysis of the situation on elections 
of presidents of oblasts, an analysis of the Ukrainian 
mentality, when anarchists are even praised in our songs. And in 
two years you did not manage to remove your representative, whom 
you appointed in Sevastopol. Will you remove such a 
representative, when he is elected by the people? 
  [Kravchuk] I will start with the second question. First, it 
is entirely untrue that I could not remove him. Simply I could 
have removed him on the following day whenever I wanted to. So 
one should not say that I did not manage to. This should be 
precise. 
  To continue. You say that there will be two constitutions. 
I will show you an example. I will show you with one example, 
let us say with the example of executive authority. The Supreme 
Council takes this as a basis -- that in Ukraine the Cabinet of 
Ministers has executive authority, the Cabinet of Ministers is 
the higher body -- takes this and on the basis of this adopts a 
law on the Cabinet of Ministers. Then there is no debate as to 
who is the head. The people will already have granted 
fundamental powers to the Cabinet of Ministers. The Supreme 
Council elaborates a law on the Cabinet of Ministers and it 
begins to work fully. And there is no discrepancy here. 
[passage omitted] 
  There is no fear here. There will only be fear if a new 
Supreme Council comes to power with nothing in the way of a 
constitution and begins once again going over what to give to 
whom. Then they will divide up into blocs, some here, some 
there, and in this way we will never agree on anything. The 
people express their will, and the Supreme Council will then act 
in accordance with the will of the people. 
  [Deputy Tkachuk] Aren't you afraid of little presidents in 
oblasts? For instance, I do not fear this. If the oblast 
entrusts one person with leading it, then let him lead. 
  [Kravchuk] Well finally, let us, well, I understand the 
complexities. I understand the ambiguity of our situation and 
life, but when we trust the people to elect a leader in the 
localities, this has more possibilities, because they know their 
own people best. Second, if he violates the law and 
constitution, he can be removed -- this is envisaged -- removed 
by the Cabinet of Ministers. And more, he can be removed by the 
representative body if deputies assemble and vote for this. 
That is, there is a counterbalance here. I am saying there is 
a counterbalance. And there is no need to be afraid. And then 
you will not be putting questions to me about why I did not sack 
the representative of the president in Sevastopol. Because this 
will be decided on the basis of the will of the people. 
  [Deputy Yatsenko] Yatsenko, Korosten region, electoral 
district 157. [passage omitted] Why not determine approximately 
five to seven selected issues that would more or less determine 
where we are really going? Then the people would understand and 
politicians would understand. And they would work for the 
people and not for something else. And I would like to reduce 
the second question to the second point regarding the president. 
The president is the guarantor of human rights and freedoms. 
Does the president have levers to implement, well, this 
protection of the people? Evidently all of this is a matter for 
the judicial authority, which has these levers. What do you 
think? Thank you. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, where we are going and what we are doing -- 
this is an eternal question. It is not, for instance, a 
question to which one can reply unambiguously. If one is to 
take the division of society on a historical scale into some 
kind of formations, this is simple to do, to capitalism or to 
socialism. This we know and studied five...[changes thought] 
you understand, social and political formations. And one can 
clearly define them. If you are talking about general rules, 
they are here, freedoms before the law irrespective of one's 
parentage, social and property freedoms, so that all forms of 
ownership are safeguarded and all people are protected. But if 
you have a specific proposal to formulate, then please formulate 
it. Please do. It can be submitted. But I repeat, this is 
about authority and what it should protect. 
  But can the president secure rights and freedoms? I think 
that, for instance, in an abstract sense he is obliged to do 
this, and in a concrete sense, certainly. But can the Supreme 
Council ensure rights and freedoms today? No. This means that 
this is a realistic mechanism when an individual should live in 
a lawful, economic and social space, which protects his 
interests. And everybody should do this -- and the president 
above all -- if he is elected by the people. This question has 
to be asked without fail. If it is not asked at all, then this 
question is left up in the air: Who ensures these rights? 
  [Deputy Zakharuk] Dmytro Zakharuk, Snyatyn electoral 
district 205. I have a question to both co-chairmen and authors 
of the said draft from this aspect: first of all, one draft was 
distributed, which truly said that the Supreme Council works on 
a permanent basis. [passage omitted] So what do you think of 
submitting this point (?to a referendum), that the Supreme 
Council works on a permanent basis. 
  [Kravchuk] I noted in the draft that the parliament works on 
a permanent basis, but not to note how many deputies. 
  [Zakharuk] Not to note down how many, but just that it is on 
a permanent basis? 
  [Kravchuk] I agree with this. Because just imagine now. I 
will name one figure now: 450 deputies and 450 assistants -- 
900 offices. The current Cabinet of Ministers has 870. And I 
am not even mentioning motor vehicle transport, apartments, or 
anything else. So maybe the new parliament will pay attention to 
the situation. So I would note -- on a permanent basis -- but 
not the number of deputies. 
  [Deputy Zakharuk] And the no less important issue is the 
establishment of a balance between legislative power and the 
president as to confidence and non-confidence in the Cabinet of 
Ministers. This is to prevent such a happening as the Supreme 
Council expressing non-confidence in the Cabinet of Ministers, 
followed by it being once again full of the same people as 
before composing it. Do you think a norm has to be brought in 
here for no more than one third of the people from the old 
Cabinet to be able to join a Cabinet of Ministers of the next 
composition if the Supreme Council expresses non-confidence in 
the Cabinet of Ministers? 
  [Kravchuk] What there can be is this: As it happens, I have 
never been a supporter of, shall we say, unequivocal decisions. 
But if you put it this way, then it cannot be one third. If, 
shall we say, the Supreme Council expresses no confidence in the 
Cabinet of Ministers, nobody can reenter a new Cabinet of 
Ministers. Otherwise, how can it be divided? What does one 
third mean? How will they be distinguished? Is one better than 
the other? You are either in or out. 
  The truth, however, is that, as we saw, there are people 
among the government that, shall we say, are not responsible for 
separate sins, whereas the whole of the Cabinet of Ministers is 
made to resign. I think what we have here is that if we take 
the road of confidence in the prime minister, and the prime 
minister is responsible for the state of executive power and is 
accountable and responsible to the Supreme Council, he then 
should have our confidence. When he resigns, he forms a new 
government that is again agreed upon by the Supreme Council. I 
cannot see it happen in any other way. 
  [Plyushch] Leonid Makarovych, your time is up. 
  [Kravchuk] Thank you.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet put off a decision on 
the referendum on basic constitutional provisions concerning 
state authorities and local governments at its evening session 
Tuesday [25 January]. 
  Ivan Plyushch, the Supreme Soviet Chairman, told deputies 
that opposing views had crystallized. Numerous deputies want to 
keep the rights of the presidential representatives intact, not 
delegating part of them to the elected bodies. Others insisted 
on electing all local authorities. 
  Plyushch also said that if the Supreme Soviet did not make a 
decision on the referendum, the president had a right to do so. 
  The proposal that a referendum on basic constitutional 
provisions should be held had been made by the constitutional 
conference held on January 14. These provisions include the 
list of the powers to be exercised by the president, the Supreme 
Soviet and the government. 
  By that draft, the president's functions would be only 
representing the country on the international scene and 
supervision of the government activities. 
  The Supreme Soviet would remain the highest legislative body 
while the government would take over all the executive functions. 
  Parliament will continue the debate on January 26.

  [Text] Kiev -- According to information from the Ukrainian 
Cabinet of Ministers' economic department, Ukraine entered a 
state of hyperinflation in the final months of 1993: in 
September the inflation index exceeded 180 percent, in October 
-- 166 percent and in November -- 145 percent. The price rises 
in December led to a new rise in the level of inflation which, 
according to previous assessments, reached almost 200 percent. 
  Incomes of the consolidated budget for January-November 1993 
were 33.718 trillion karbovantsi, 8.765 trillion karbovantsi in 
credits from Ukrainian banks were drawn into the budget to cover 
the planned deficit and a number of other expenses. The 
mobilization of the budget's incomes took place in difficult 
conditions: a considerable number of enterprises, organizations 
and institutions and also citizens violated the tax law, 
actually underestimating earned income and profits and delayed 
making payments to the budget. Expenditure of the consolidated 
budget for January-November was 38.673 trillion karbovantsi. Of 
this figure, 12.464 trillion (32.2 percent of total expenditure) 
were directed at the implementation of measures for the social 
protection of the population; 8.944 trillion (23.1 percent) for 
the financing of socio-cultural measures, and 8.725 trillion 
karbovantsi (22.6 percent) for the national economy. The 
financing of expenditures on defence was 1.639 trillion 
karbovantsi and 1.096 trillion karbovantsi for maintaining law 
enforcement bodies. The consolidated budget of Ukraine was 
fulfilled with an excess of expenditure over income of 4.955 
trillion karbovantsi. 
  The emission of money in 1993 was 12.299 trillion 
karbovantsi 
which is 25 times more than in 1992. In the fourth quarter 
alone an additional 7.537 trillion karbovantsi entered into 
circulation of which 3.776 trillion karbovantsi took place in 
December. 
  Creditors' debts between Ukrainian enterprises and 
organizations and economic subjects of former USSR countries 
declined in November by almost 40 percent and was 5.7 trillion 
karbovantsi at the beginning of December while debts grew by 15 
percent reaching 4.6 trillion karbovantsi. Creditors' debts of 
Ukrainian enterprises with Russian trading partners declined by 
38 percent (from 8.2 trillion karbovantsi as of 1 November to 
5.1 trillion karbovantsi by 1 December) and with Turkmenistan by 
96 percent (from 588.1 billion karbovantsi to 24.3 billion 
karbovantsi respectively). In total over 11 months of 1993 
creditors' debts grew by 17 times and debtors' debts by 10 times. 
  In 1993 measures were carried out to form a hard currency 
market in Ukraine. As a result of this, the volume of currency 
sales at the Ukrainian interbank currency exchange rose 
continuously throughout January-August. Thus, if $7.3 million 
were sold during trading in January, in March the figure was 
40.4 million, in June -- 122.3 million, in July -- 142.7 
million; trading in German Marks: in April -- 5.1 million, in 
June -- 11.5 million, in July -- 12.9 million, in August -- 16.8 
million; trading in Russian rubles: in April -- 11.6 billion and 
in June -- 74.2 billion. 
  However, from August to September the volume of sales of 
these currencies began to decline at exchanges and in October 
only $29.3 million, 3.3 million German marks, and 10 billion 
Russian rubles were sold. 
  During the year there was a sharp drop in the exchange rate 
of the Ukrainian karbovanets in relation to foreign currencies. 
Thus, if during trading on 5 January 1993 the exchange rate was 
798 karbovantsi to the U.S. dollar, during trading on 28 October 
it was 31,000 karbovantsi. During trading in April the German 
mark was being sold at 1,886 karbovantsi but at the end of 
October it was 19,300 karbovantsi and the Russian ruble was 
3.5-4.3 karbovantsi and 25 karbovantsi respectively. 
  During 11 months of 1993 (compared with December 1992) 
prices 
for consumer goods and services increased by 54 times, by 57 
times for foodstuffs, and by 70 times for non-food products. 
  Average monthly salaries for workers in the state sector of 
the economy increased by 19 times in the 11 months of 1993 and 
in November amounted to 307,200 karbovantsi which is almost 40 
times lower than the value of the minimum consumer budget. 
  At the beginning of 1994, 123,400 citizens who required help 
to find work were registered in employment establishments. Of 
these 83,900 were granted the status of unemployed.

  [Text] "The Ukrainian president will take no resolute 
actions towards the Crimean Republic on the eve of the second 
round of presidential elections there," Ukrainian people's 
deputy from the Crimea, Vladimir Sevastyanov, told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. He had taken part in a meeting between 
President Kravchuk and several members of Ukraine's parliament 
representing Crimea Monday evening. 
  According to Sevastyanov, "at the meeting Kravchuk pointed 
to 
the unwillingness of Russia and the U.S. to revise borders or 
recognize the Crimean Republic after their statement signed in 
Moscow." 
  Kravchuk also stressed that he himself has nothing against 
the candidates for the Crimean presidency, Sevastyanov noted. 
  According to Sevastyanov, Kravchuk said that "the Ukrainian 
army will remain outside politics, and, should the situation 
destabilize, the existing structures of law-enforcement agencies 
will have to be used." Kravchuk made it clear that Crimea can 
use additional law-enforcement forces, "if it is in a position 
to keep them." 
  At his meeting with the deputies from Crimea, President 
Kravchuk also said that neither the Ukrainian parliament nor he 
himself will interfere in the process of establishing an open 
economy in Crimea. According to the Ukrainian president, the 
efforts to achieve economic stabilization in Crimea will now 
depend solely on the measures the Crimean leadership will take. 
  Kiev will support all Simferopol's initiatives, if they do 
not conflict with Ukraine's legislation, Kravchuk told the 
deputies from Crimea. 
  In the first round of presidential elections in Crimea, the 
greatest number of votes was collected by the pro-Russian 
candidate, Yuriy Meshkov. In the second round, the present 
Speaker of the Crimean parliament, Nikolay Bahrov, will be his 
rival.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Battle' in Crimea, Everything Up in </F>
Smoke"] 
  [Text] The increased tension in Crimea's sociopolitical 
life caused by Kiev's dissatisfaction with the results of the 
first round of the presidential election in Simferopol cannot, 
it appears, reduce the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces. From 24 through 28 January large-scale command-staff 
exercises are being conducted by Armed Forces units and commands 
on the territory of Odessa, Kherson, and Nikolayev Oblasts and 
in Crimea. 
  No doubt in this connection, in an interview with KIYEVSKIYE 
VEDOMOSTI Ukrainian Defense Minister General Radetskyy made the 
statement that "I would not like to have to liberate Crimea as 
the Americans liberated Kuwait." In response to this, Admiral 
Eduard Baltin, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, expressed doubt 
that the young, respected, and promising Ukrainian defense 
minister could become a General Schwarzkopf....

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of the Crimean </F>
Supreme Council and Crimean presidential candidate, by 
unidentified DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA correspondent by telephone 
from the Crimea; date not given: "We Will Struggle...." 
  [Text]The Central Electoral Committee appointed the 
second round of Crimean presidential elections for 30 January. 
The leader of the Crimean Republican Party, Yuriy Meshkov, and 
the chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council, Nikolay Bagrov, 
will compete for the post. The difference in the number of 
votes they received in the first round of elections was quite 
significant. That is why the present speaker's chances of 
victory are assessed as illusory. Besides, those candidates who 
had quit the struggle called upon the voters to cast their votes 
for separatist Meshkov. How does Nikolay Bagrov himself see the 
situation? Our correspondent phoned him and asked him to answer 
a few questions. 
  [Bagrov] I will take part in the second round -- this is not 
so little. All of my opponents campaigned against Bagrov and 
accused me of all the shortcomings of Ukraine's economic policy 
and of all the difficulties. Of course, it is a serious 
struggle. However, I am an optimist, and I think that I have a 
real chance of winning. For this, it is necessary to struggle. 
People have already started thinking.... 
  [DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA] Yet, Nikolay Vasilyevich, you 
probably counted upon greater support in the first round. 
  [Bagrov] I was honest with the people. Meshkov promised 
them that Russia would take them into her open arms. He said 
everywhere that once people vote for him, they will receive 
prosperity and peace. The Crimea will become Russian. I am not 
promising people a rose garden, because one will have to meet 
the bills after the elections. I am openly saying at all 
meetings that the secession of the Crimea from Ukraine is out of 
the question. Meshkov's policy leads to an impasse. 
  Let us look at things realistically. There exist the 
Helsinki Agreements on the inviolability of borders that emerged 
after World War II. There exists an agreement between Ukraine 
and Russia where the inviolability of the borders of the two 
countries is recognized. Finally, a tripartite agreement was 
signed in Moscow between the United States, Ukraine, and Russia 
on the elimination of nuclear weapons; these aspects are also 
reflected there. Ukraine received guarantees of European 
countries in addition to those of the United States. It is 
naive to assume that Russia will want to violate these 
agreements. 
  I believe that we have not yet fully implemented, in the 
interests of the Crimean people, the possibilities of the 
autonomy offered to us by Ukraine's legislation in both economic 
and political spheres. 
  [DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA] The election campaign in the Crimea 
has been accompanied by a series of murders. The assassination 
of your adviser Iskander Mamedov near his family's house is 
simply appalling. What can you say about this? 
  [Bagrov] Iskander organized my election campaign. He was a 
very good and decent person. I deeply mourn his death and 
sympathize with his relatives and friends. A criminal case has 
been initiated, and competent organs must answer who needed this. 
  I will say one thing: I want to live in the Crimea and do 
everything in order that harmony and peace prevail on the 
peninsula and that it becomes a bridge connecting Ukraine and 
Russia, and not a new Karabakh.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The presidential race in the Crimea is approaching 
the finish line, and we will learn who is the winner in a couple 
of days. 
  The electoral debacle of Mykola Bagrov, speaker of the 
Crimean parliament, in the first round of elections is virtually 
a defeat for the Party of Crimean Economic Rebirth [PEVK], which 
decided to support Bagrov at its convention. As a matter of 
fact, the PEVK could propose for president one its members -- 
there are suitable candidates in this party. However, 
entrepreneurs have always been noted for their realistic and 
sober thinking and their ability to predict things. They 
understand that experience gathered at rallies is not enough to 
become a good president. Czars, for example, were prepared to 
rule from the day they were born -- and not all of them were 
good at it. When someone's background includes only a higher 
educational institution -- and a Soviet one at that -- and 
slight experience as an attorney, he would find it somewhat hard 
to run the state. Yuriy Meshkov never got a chance to hold even 
a low managerial post. Of course, he did not even plan to 
become the president. He was elevated this high by the 
All-Russian idea and ample promises generally distributed at 
rallies during the first round. Here is what Oleksandr Dudko, 
member of the PEVK Presidium and president of the Union of 
Crimean Entrepreneurs, told us. 
  [Begin Dudko recording] If you carefully read programs of 
the 
PEVK and Meshkov, you'll find them consisting of basically the 
same elements -- salaries paid in rubles, removal of customs 
barriers, etc. -- only our program is without any heavy 
political shading. To achieve all this, one doesn't necessarily 
have to quarrel with our current situation and replace one 
border with another. [end recording] 
  The PEVK will soon try to demonstrate to Crimean residents 
its implementation mechanisms and expose all of its advantages. 
However, it will be up to electors to decide for whom they

  [Text] "The draft budget for 1994 presented to the Supreme 
Soviet in which expenditures coincide with revenues defies 
common sense and has no economic legitimacy." This is said in a 
statement by the Ukrainian Constitutional Democratic Party 
[UCDP] promulgated on 24 January. In the opinion of the 
Constitutional Democrats, the attempts to please international 
financial organizations will only further discredit Ukraine as a 
country "run by ignoramuses." The UCDP believes that no one in 
Ukraine has any illusions about the cabinet of ministers, but 
the performance by Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko has 
transcended all permissible bounds. The UCDP has called for his 
immediate resignation. Meanwhile the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet 
will not return to the consideration of the budget until 27 
January.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Rukh Believes That a Campaign of </F>
Political Terrorism Is Being Waged Against It"] 
  [Text] On 20 January, the chairman of the Ukraine People's 
Rukh [Movement for Perestroyka] held a news conference during 
which he read the statement, adopted the day before by the Rukh 
central leadership on the terror campaign against Rukh, its 
leaders, and activists. The Rukh believes that the acts of 
terror against it are due to its political line aimed at the 
building of an independent democratic state and at ridding 
Ukraine of the former communist nomenklatura. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil quoted a number of facts: Several 
attacks, over the recent weeks, on the electoral headquarters of 
the Rukh Chernivtsi regional organization; a pogrom on Christmas 
night in the building of the Ternopil Rukh organization; the 
beating up of the children of several leaders of rayon Rukh 
organizations in Odessa Oblast. Unknown people broke into the 
apartment of the chairman of the Kirovohrad organization, and on 
15 January, there was an attempt to break into the apartment of 
Les Tanyuk, member of the central Rukh leadership and member of 
Ukraine's Supreme Council Presidium. On 17 January, in broad 
daylight, Colonel Serhiy Budko was beaten up in Vinnytsya. 
Finally, there is the attack on the Rukh secretariat in Kiev 
and the disappearance of the head of the secretariat Mykhaylo 
Boychyshyn, of whom nothing is known to this day. 
  Rukh demands that the president and the Supreme Council 
chairman intervene in the situation and that Ukraine's Security 
Service, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Procurator 
General's Office investigate the criminal actions against Rukh 
activists.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Danko report: "Provocation or Speculation? The </F>
Kidnapped Chief of the Rukh Secretariat Has Not Been Found Yet"] 
  [Excerpts] The election campaign in Ukraine, with the 
abundance of aspirants for deputy seats, could not do without 
manifestations of extremism. And its first victim has been one 
of the most powerful political parties -- the Ukrainian People's 
Rukh with a fixed membership of more than 50,000, which has 
fielded candidates in practically all constituencies. 
  The Rukh Secretariat's press department reported that 
overnight from 15 to 16 January an armed attack was launched on 
the secretariat building. [passage omitted] 
  The central event of that night was the disappearance of 
Mikhail Boychishin, 43, head of the Rukh Secretariat, deputy of 
the Lvov Oblast Council and Rukh's parliament deputy candidate, 
who left three hours before the attack but never got home. 
[passage omitted] 
  Rukh leader and parliament deputy Vyacheslav Chornovil told 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that "we are dealing here 
with a system of political provocations and political terror 
with the only aim being the disruption of the normal conduct of 
the election campaign and the intimidation of Rukh members and 
voters." [passage omitted] 
  The actions by the authorities were glaringly passive. It 
was not until Vyacheslav Chornovil's energetic intervention that 
the police, prosecution, and security service bodies started an 
investigation into Boychishin's disappearance. [passage omitted] 
  Ivan Makar, a Rukh critic, former human rights activist and 
currently an independent member of parliament, holds a different 
opinion on what has happened. In his view, there has been a 
political provocation. "In all likelihood, Rukh itself has 
organized this in order to gain extra points in the elections. 
Whoever needed to seize Boychishin in the Rukh building when he 
could have been easily captured near his home?" Ivan Makar said. 
It should be noted that his view is apparently shared by 
representatives of other Ukrainian political parties which are 
in no hurry to issue statements in support of Rukh activists.

  [Text] Speaking at a news conference held in Lvov on 24 
January, Andriy Shkil, chairman of the Ukrainian National 
Assembly [UNA] Lvov Oblast Committee, deemed the affair of Rukh 
Deputy Chairman Mykhaylo Boychyshyn's disappearance as a "storm 
in a teacup." Shkil pointed out that "if some people lack 
action, words are brought to the fore, and affairs like this one 
arise." The UNA regional commander underlined: "When Mykhaylo 
Boychyshyn was still Shevchenkivskyy Rayon Council chairman in 
Lvov he had certain connections that could be the motives behind 
his disappearance" and added that "we cannot rule out that in a 
day or two Boychyshyn will emerge safe and sound, and will tell 
tales about his kidnapping." Boychyshyn's wife's televised 
appeal gave this idea to Shkil because "one had the impression 
that she had recently seen her husband." UNA Chairman Yuriy 
Shukhevych said: "Mykhaylo Boychyshyn is not an outstanding Rukh 
activist. Why has there been no similar actions against 
Vyacheslav Chornovil?" The UNA leadership believes that 
Boychyshyn's mysterious disappearance might be linked to Rukh's 
financial activities. 
  Meanwhile, according to a report by Maryana Chorna published 
in Lvov's RATUSHA on 22 January, the newspaper had received 
"unsubstantiated information from law enforcement circles" that 
Mykhaylo Boychyshyn's dead body had been discovered.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 25 (AFP)--Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid 
Alimov on Tuesday called on all Tajiks to take part in general 
elections in July, and said the Islamic opposition should play 
an active role in restoring peace to the central Asian republic. 
  Alimov, attending a ministerial meeting of the 10-member 
Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Tehran, told AFP he 
appreciated an Iranian offer to help end the civil war in 
Tajikistan, where government forces have been fighting Muslim 
fundamentalists for more than a year. 
  However, Tajikistan "prefers the crisis to be resolved 
through wider efforts undertaken by the United Nations," he 
added. 
  Alimov said the government intended to hold general 
elections 
in July and called on Tajiks inside and outside the country to 
take part. 
  Last week Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister 'Abbas Maleki said 
Iran had launched mediation efforts to end the conflict, 
following a request from four other Muslim central Asian states 
-- Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. 
  He said Iran was determined to use its influence to restore 
security to Tajikistan, and had already held talks with Tajik 
opposition leaders. 
  Pro-communist forces seized power in the Tajik capital 
Dushanbe in December 1992, toppling the ruling coalition of 
democratic and Islamic forces. 
  Iran has so far adopted a low profile toward the conflict to 
avoid antagonising the newly-independent central Asian states, 
with which it has been trying to boost economic and cultural 
ties. 
  Iranian President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani opened the 
fourth session of the ECO Council of Ministers in Tehran on 
Tuesday with a call for an end to conflicts in central Asia and 
the Caucasus. 
  Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati told AFP the crisis in 
Tajikistan may be discussed during the two-day meeting. 
  The ECO was founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and 
expanded in 1991 to include Afghanistan as well as the former 
Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, 
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Berezovskiy report under "Near Neighbors" rubric: </F>
"Forces Have United on the Border"] 
  [Text] Ashgabat -- Boris Yeltsin and Saparmurad Niyazov 
signed an intergovernmental agreement in Ashgabat last December 
on joint guarding of Turkmenistan's border and on the Russian 
servicemen's status. What gave rise to this document, and what 
has it changed in the life of our soldiers? Vladislav 
Shunevich, chief of staff and first deputy commander of 
Turkmenistan's border troops, speaks: 
  "Turkmenia's state border has always been complex. It is 
2,472.1 km long. It extends over mountains and desert sands, 
along rivers, and across the Caspian. In the old union it was 
`covered' by the Central Asia Border District. As of 11 August 
1992 the guarding of the border passed entirely into the hands 
of Turkmenistan. I will not say that these changes caused a 
disaster. But the `green caps' encountered serious problems. 
Owing to the rupture of ties with Russia, it became difficult to 
maintain in `combat readiness' the various obstacles in the path 
of possible violators. 
  "In previous years it was mainly Slav officers and soldiers 
who were sent to the USSR's southern border. It was thought 
that they stood up better to the heat here and, moreover, any 
contact with Iranians and Afghans was ruled out on ethnic 
grounds. After Ukraine and Belarus demanded the return of their 
servicemen before 31 [date as published] November, and the 
Russian Supreme Soviet of its troops before 31 December 1993, a 
mass exodus began. Incidentally, the last six compulsory-service 
Russian soldiers left the border literally one month ago. Here 
I will emphasize that there was not a single case of desertion! 
As a rule, officers were transferred back home only after they 
had trained a replacement. Nevertheless, we have run into an 
acute shortage of professionals. 
  "A partial solution has been found. A school for junior 
officers `forges' lieutenants and ensigns in the space of three 
months. Students drafted from higher educational institutions 
have closed up the breaches among specialists in communications 
and in motor vehicle and aviation hardware. University 
graduates have become deputy commanders for work with personnel, 
henceforth made up entirely of residents of Turkmenia. 
  "Today one-half of the officers are already Turkmens. But we 
risked losing the Russian servicemen who had stayed -- the 
backbone of the commander corps. The first talks began under 
Russian Security Minister Barannikov. They soon reached 
impasse. The deadlock was overcome when Andrey Nikolayev came 
to head the Russian Federation's border troops. Much was 
resolved by his talks with President Saparmurad Niyazov of 
Turkmenistan -- knots of problems were `unraveled.' 
  "A joint command has been set up, headed by the commander of 
Turkmenistan's border troops. He has two deputies. I, the 
chief of staff, am one, and the other is the chief of the 
Russian Border Troops Operations Group, to whom all the Russian 
servicemen are subordinate. The Russian Federation has taken on 
their funding, while Turkmenistan will pay for the supply of 
hardware, ammunition, and arms. The most important thing is 
that the Russian officer can continue to serve calmly. He 
retains all rights and privileges indefinitely. You know, some 
officers who had tendered requests for a transfer have now 
withdrawn them. 
  "What is service like for the Russian officer in Turkmenia? 
There are no problems with housing or children's schooling. 
All school graduates whose fathers are serving in the Border 
Troops Directorate entered institutes or universities last year. 
Wages are paid at the officer's request either in manats or in 
rubles. There is no question of discrimination along ethnic 
lines. All the border detachment chiefs of staff are Russian 
officers. Yes, language problems do arise. But the Turkmens 
speak Russian, and all orders are given in it. Office work is 
also done in Russian. 
  "The signed agreement is also advantageous to Russia. 
Afghanistan remains a zone of heightened tension. The Turkmen 
leadership maintains close, good relations with the leaders of 
the northwestern provinces -- Turan Ismail Khan and Rashid 
Dostam -- but this does not remove all problems. Mass poverty 
is pushing Afghans into robbery and theft and the seizure of 
pastures and lands. The drugs business has assumed dangerous 
proportions in Afghanistan and is literally breaching the 
border. It is possible to speak purely hypothetically about a 
border service on the Afghan side, but many servicemen there, 
moreover, are light-fingered and live by smuggling. 
  "The Iranian border is a little quieter. A pass regime has 
been introduced there. But all kinds of things happen. A 
subunit under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lopushko 
recently tracked down some smugglers who were using three horses 
to carry a 150 kg consignment of drugs from Afghanistan across 
Turkmenia into Iran. The servicemen pursued them across 
snow-covered mountains for more than 30 km, caught up with them, 
and disarmed them after a fight. 
  "If Russia quits the Turkmen border, a muddy wave of crime 
and terrorism and a wave of drugs will swamp the Commonwealth 
countries. There have been proposals to move the border further 
north, but that is unrealistic. It would cost a colossal amount 
of money to equip."

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 25, BNS -- Eleven Estonian MP's in a 
statement yesterday expressed their outrage at what they called 
insulting statements made to the press by the chief of the 
country's defense forces, Major General Aleksander Einseln. 
  Einseln in his statements recently has called the country's 
problem military unit, the Laanemaa volunteer infantry company, 
a "political mob" and has driven parallels between the unit and 
the Nazi groups in Germany at the beginning of the Hitler era in 
early 1930's. 
  Einseln, an emigre Estonian and retired U.S. army colonel, 
who returned to his home country and took over command of the 
defense forces last spring, has also been publicly critical of 
the Estonian state and people. 
  The MP's in the statement admit there are lots of problems 
of 
a complex character waiting to be resolved in Estonia, including 
problems in the defense forces and in the sector of the Interior 
Ministry. 
  "But all this cannot and shouldn't serve as basis for any 
person in the service of the Estonian state to disdain the 
Estonian people and the Estonian state," the MP's say. 
  The MP's who signed the statement say Einseln must publicly 
bring his excuses or an explanation of a possible 
misinterpretation of his words by the media.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, Jan 25, BNS -- The Commission for State 
Defense in the Estonian parliament today ruled to reject a draft 
bill calling for dismissal of the country's commander in chief, 
Major General Aleksander Einseln. The bill was submitted by 
opposition MP Katrin Linde. 
  Peeter Lorents, chairman of the defense commission, said the 
bill was turned down because it contained contradictions with 
the Constitution. Lorents said it was possible that Linde would 
bring the draft in line with legal standards and submit it to 
the parliament for a second time. 
  Lorents added that discussion of the draft had taken place 
in 
a peaceful parliamentary atmosphere. 
  Linde's suggestions were met with irony ranging to taunt at 
Monday's meeting of the parliament. [sentence as received] 
  The draft suggested the dismissal of Aleksander Einseln and 
revoking the earlier law on his appointment to office. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Wednesday, January 26 -- The government decided 
to approve the Justice Ministry propositions concerning the 
changed status of Paldiski pending the elections of the local 
council. Paldiski is to be merged with Keila to form a district 
of the latter, while the surrounding areas will be turned over

and budgets of the government special representative to 
Paldiski, Juri Tikk. 
  A closed contest, held by the Economy Ministry, will be 
declared in order to purchase surveillance equipment for the 
border guard. The Border Guard Department was allocated the 
funds for the equipment. Prime Minister Mart Laar told the news 
conference that comparatively few offers have been made for the 
land border surveillance and the final decision can be made by 
April. Although the border guard preferred the Israeli company 
"Elbit", the government decided to hold a contest. Estonia has 
coordinated the purchases with Latvia and Lithuania, Laar added. 
[passage omitted) 
  The government decided to exempt foreign loans, foreign aid, 
credits with government guarantee and goods purchased for them 
from the sales tax. The equipment for the defence forces, the 
police and border guard, as well as presents connected with 
official visits, will also be exempted from the tax. [passage

  [Text] Tallinn, January 25 -- Colonel Raul Luks, the 
Estonian governor for former Soviet submarine training base, 
Paldiski, in north west Estonia took office on Tuesday [25 
January] and met the head of Russian navy's training centre, 
Admiral Aleksandr Olkhovikov. 
  Olkhovikov promised to present withdrawal timetable very 
soon, Luks said while adding another meeting would be held after 
a meeting in Stockholm on Paldiski reactors held from Tuesday to 
Thursday. The meeting was organised by the Swedish Foreign 
Ministry and besides Estonia and Russia also experts from U.S., 
Germany and Finland attend. The deadline for withdrawal is 
August 31, 1994. 
  Estonian Justice Minister Kaido Kama told a government 
briefing on Tuesday the government had supported Justice 
Ministry's proposition to unite Paldiski with Keila, a small 
town some 30 km from Estonia's capital Tallinn, pending local 
elections. This would be a step on bringing civil power 
structures to Paldiski, Kama said. 
  Local elections were skipped in Paldiski last fall due to 
Russian military presence.

  [Text] Tallinn, January 25 -- Arms shipment for Estonia's 
Defence Forces from Israel worth $40 million was discharged at 
the Port of Tallinn on January 23, reliable sources told ETA. 
  Estonian government on January 7, 1993 concluded a $60 
million agreement with state-owned Israeli arms company TAAS 
under which the company must supply Estonia with arms by end of 
1995 and Estonia must makes payments by 2000. 
  The deal brought about a political uproar in Estonia 
resulting in ratification of the deal at Riigikogu's closed 
session on December 15 last year with 57 affirmative votes 
against 10 negative and two abstentions. 
  "The deal with Israel does not so much increase Estonian 
national defence than the will to defend Estonian state," Rein 
Helme, deputy head of the parliament's state defence commission, 
said. 
  Estonia bought from Israel automatic rifles Galil (5.56 mm 
caliber), machine guns Negev (5.56 mm), submachine guns 
Mini-Uzi, sniper's rifles, grenade launchers, mortars, 
antiaircraft guns, missiles, ammunition, radio transmitters. 
  First shipment arrived in Estonia last summer.

  [Text] Russia supports Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev's 
state program for improving the position of ethnic Russians in 
his republic, says Yeltsin's message to Akayev, handed to the 
Kyrgyz president by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  This document confirms Moscow's readiness to continue 
rendering every possible economic assistance and support to 
fraternal Kyrgyzstan. 
  During his talks with Akayev, Kozyrev described Kyrgyzstan 
as 
one of Russia's closest allies. "I've always said that we are 
not alien to each other, although many have accused me of 
imperialism for such words," said the Russian minister. "What 
can be more normal than stating that we are vitally interested 
in each other," he said. 
  President Akayev said that the new program was aimed at 
checking the outflow of ethnic Russians from Kyrgyzstan. He 
believes that the Russian foreign minister's current visit will 
help support the industrial enterprises mostly employing ethnic 
Russians. 
  Akayev also said that the Kyrgyz defense enterprises 
employing ethnic Russians and their Russian partners should have 
equal access to raw materials and equipment. "This is not going 
to be a one-way street," he said. "If large packages of Kyrgyz 
enterprises' shares go to Russia, these enterprises will carry 
on, providing thousands of people with jobs," he added. He also 
thinks that this would enhance ethnic Russians' confidence. 
  As an example of the efforts to raise the ethnic Russians' 
status he referred to the establishment of a Kyrgyz-Slavic 
university in Bishkek which is training 200 students. To quote 
the Kyrgyz president, this university "is expected to calm the 
Slavic ethnic groups living in Kyrgyzstan, because their 
children will be able to receive an education in their native 
language." 
  The program also contains measures to ensure that the 
teaching of the Russian language, the language of inter-state 
communication in the CIS, is not reduced. "The Kyrgyz people 
cannot neglect the great source of Russian culture," said 
Akayev.

<F P=106> ["Text" of Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin </F>
message to President Askar Akayev] 
  [Text] Estemeed Askar Akayevich, as you know, Russia 
closely follows with interest (?the development of events in 
Kyrgyzstan) and the steps which the government of Kyrgyzstan is 
taking so as to tackle difficult economic, social, and political 
problems in the transitional period. This is understandable 
since similar processes are also taking place in Russia. 
  On the other hand, and this is very important, the future 
and 
the status of Russian-Kyrgyzstan relations depends a great deal 
on how successful we are in our movement toward transformations 
and the wise choice by our people of the main directions, values 
and priorities. Cooperation and friendly relations between the 
two independent countries should be built on this basis. 
  I want to emphasize that we strive to strengthen friendly 
relations and wish for comprehensive cooperation with 
Kyrgyzstan, its president and the government in the interests of 
common goals. 
  We are devoted to the deep historically based roots 
connecting the Kyrgyz and Russian peoples, the fruitful legacy 
of which could not only be preserved but also enriched. This is 
especially important in light of the fact that in many centuries 
of our history the fates of the citizens of Russia and 
Kyrgyzstan have become intertwined. 
  We have already covered a major part of the path in building 
Russian-Kyrgyzstan relations. Its legal and normative basis has 
been created; a mechanism for realizing bilateral relations is 
being upgraded. Of course, we still have much to do in building 
our interstate relations, and should take into consideration the 
existing realities and common interests as well as the 
aspirations of the two countries toward preserving close 
relations, comprehensive interaction and mutual understanding. 
  Like you, Askar Akayevich, I am sure that the considerable 
intellectual and professional potential of the Russian-speaking 
community residing in Kyrgyzstan could be used effectively in 
successful implemention of political and economic reforms, 
strengthening democratic [word indistinct] and maintaining the 
interethnic accord of the peoples of Kyrgyzstan. 
  We understand that this is the goal of a state program aimed 
at stabilizing the status of the Russian-speaking community. It 
is being elaborated with the participation of different public 
forces of the republic. 
  We highly evaluate, Askar Akayevich, your personal 
contribution to the development of Kyrgyzstan-Russian relations, 
your activity aimed at strengthening [words indistinct] and 
democratic transformations in the republic. I am convinced that 
only on the basis of real economic and political 
transformations, and by joining our efforts will we succeed in 
achieving progress and prosperity for our nations. In 
connection with this I confirm the readiness of Russia to 
continue rendering economic assistance and support to the 
fraternal Kyrgyzstan. I want to wish you, estemeed Askar 
Akayevich, success in your honorable work in the interests of 
multinational Kyrgyzstan. Together with you we are ready to do 
everything [word indistinct] to develop and strengthen 
friendship and cooperation. [passage indistinct]

  [Text] "Two centuries ago the Kyrgyzes chose Russia as 
their main ally and today they cannot abandon this great source 
of culture," said Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev. 
  He told Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Bishkek 
on 
Tuesday that a program was being drawn up to stabilize the 
position of Kyrgyzstan's Russian-speaking population, the aim of 
which was to reduce Russian speakers' emigration from the 
republic. One of the objectives of the program is to prevent 
attempts to cut down the teaching of Russian, a language used in 
contacts between different CIS states, Akayev said. As an 
example of support given to Kyrgyzstan's Russian-speaking 
community, he cited the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavonic University, set 
up last year. It has 200 students at present and is expected to 
have about 1000 in future. The creation of the university 
"ought to reassure the Kyrgyz Slavs, whose children can receive 
an education in their native language," the president said. 
  It is only jointly with Russia that Kyrgyzstan is able to 
solve the problems of its Russian-speakers, he said. "We can 
solve the psychological problems and create a favorable 
atmosphere, but it would be difficult for Kyrgyzstan to handle 
the economic aspects of the problem on its own," he said. 
  Akayev said Kyrgyz enterprises were short of raw materials 
and components, while the customs barriers and dual taxation 
raised the cost of their output tenfold. However, not only 
Kyrgyzstan and Russia but also other Commonwealth states needed 
goods produced by those enterprises, he said. He expressed the 
hope that the visit of Kozyrev, who arrived in Bishkek on 
Monday, would help solve some of those problems, which would 
have a serious positive effect on Kyrgyzstan's industry, where 
many of the republic's Russian speakers are employed. 
  The president said Kyrgyzstan's former military enterprises 
should have the same access to raw materials as such enterprises 
in Russia. "This won't be a one-way street. Let Russia own 
many of the shares in Kyrgyz enterprises. Thereby we will keep 
those enterprises going, providing work for tens of thousands of 
people," he said. It will also strengthen "the Slavs' 
confidence in their future," he said. 
  Kozyrev handed over to Akayev a letter from Russian 
President 
Boris Yeltsin, who expressed support for the comprehensive 
stabilization program for Kyrgyzstan's Russian speakers, work on 
which was being guided by Akayev. Russia is ready "to continue 
helping fraternal Kyrgyzstan economically as much as it can," 
Yeltsin said. 
  Kozyrev told Akayev Kyrgyzstan was one of Russia's closest 
allies. "I've always said that we are not indifferent to each 
other, although these days I'm accused of imperialism for such 
words. What can be more normal than saying that we are vitally 
interested in each other," he said. 
  "We, the people of Kyrgyzstan, are only too glad to hear 
that," Akayev responded. 
  Kozyrev said Russia's attempts to protect the 
Russian-speaking population in other former Soviet republics had 
nothing to do with imperialism. But "we cannot remain 
indifferent to restrictions put on the rights of Russian 
speakers, who are, for example, being ousted from Latvia," he 
said. 
  Akayev said he could trace no imperial ambitions in Russia's 
foreign policy. "Eurasia cannot be stable without a powerful and 
great Russia," he said. 
  According to Kyrgyz Deputy Foreign Minister Askar Aitmatov, 
the Russian speakers' position in Kyrgyzstan does pose a 
problem. "It is a fact that there are certain things the 
(ethnic) Russian are concerned about. But at the governmental 
level everything is being done to eliminate the causes of that 
concern and ensure equal rights for the Russian-speaking 
population, as for all other citizens of Kyrgyzstan," he told 
INTERFAX. 
  In his opinion, the dual citizenship issue should be put 
before parliament. 
  However, Akayev, addressing the First Congress of Peoples of 
Kyrgyzstan last Saturday, said dual citizenship could be granted 
to residents of the republic on the basis of bilateral 
agreements and the right to it should not be formalized in the 
Constitution. He said all decisions on the issue would be 
determined by Russia's role as Kyrgyzstan's "main partner in all 
spheres." Earlier Akayev's press service said work on the dual 
citizenship problem would be "a constitutional process," not "an 
arbitrary decision by the president."

  [Text] Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev believes that the 
republic's citizens can be granted the right for dual 
citizenship in accordance with bilateral agreements and should 
be not fixed as a constitutional norm. 
  He declared about this on Saturday at the opening of the 
first Kurultai (congress) of Kyrgyzstan's peoples. At the same 
time Akayev underlined that he would solve the problem of dual 
citizenship minding Russia's priority significance "as the major 
partner in all spheres." 
  According to the Kyrgyz leader, "the Russian language has 
been and remains the second one" for the republic's all peoples. 
Akayev is convinced that it is necessary "to strive for 
trilinguality which is to become the basis of mentality of 
Kyrgyzstan's single people" (saying trilinguality, Akayev 
believes that all citizens of the republic must fluently speak 
the Kyrgyz, Russian, and English languages -- Interfax). He 
pointed out that the lingual factor "should not be a dominating 
one" during educating process and job placement. 
  Akayev called formation of a maximum favorable climate for 
joint existence of all nations and citizens as a necessary 
condition to activate consolidation of all ethnic groups into 
Kyrgyzstan's "single people." After the compatriots perceive 
their multinational unity, there will appear "a public 
atmosphere of aversion to nationalism and chauvinism."

  [Text] Addressing an international congress of 
industrialists and entrepreneurs in Tashkent, Uzbek President 
Islam Karimov said that Uzbekistan's future is inconceivable 
without Russia. 
  The president unequivocally favors the restoration and 
development of economic ties among the CIS countries and the 
states of Eastern Europe. At the same time he emphasized that 
the issue of restoring all previous interstate ties should not 
arise. 
  Karimov also noted that Russia continues - and I quote here 
- 
to play the role of a dictator with regard to countries which 
used to form the USSR. The disintegration of the ruble zone is 
a good example of this, the president of Uzbekistan claims, for 
it was at that time that Russia made its partners face the 
necessity of introducing their own currencies.

  [Text] An inter-departmental council for economic reform, 
enterprise, and foreign investment will be set up in President 
Islam Karimov's office. According to an appropriate 
presidential decree, released in Tashkent on Saturday, the new 
body will "promote economic reform, guarantee privatization, and 
encourage free enterprise in the republic." 
  The president gave the cabinet two weeks to form the council 
and one month to work out a privatization program to transform 
restricted joint stock companies into private businesses where 
all citizens can buy shares. 
  According to the document, shops and public services with 
the 
land they stand on can be bought by local residents and 
foreigners without declaring their source of income. 
  The decree lifts restrictions on the amount of hard currency 
and CIS money allowed for local citizens and foreigners to bring 
in and out of Uzbekistan. 
  Joint ventures producing consumer goods will no longer be 
taxed on their profits in convertible currency, if foreign 
investments in their statute fund do not exceed 50%. 
  Custom duties on all imports will be totally lifted by July 
1, 1995. 
  The decree also lists administrative bodies authorized to 
permit the setting up of businesses and fix temporary custom 
duties on exports to CIS and other countries. It also lists 
commodities prohibited for export to CIS and other states. The 
prohibition applies to flour, meat, butter, tea, sugar, and 
artifacts of significant value. 
  As Finance Minister Bakhtiyar, a deputy prime minister, has 
reported, in the first half of this year the republic intends to 
introduce the "sum" - a national monetary unit that will replace 
the temporary coupons, now in circulation. 
  Speaking at an international seminar on banking in Tashkent, 
he declared that the main task for Uzbekistan in credit policy 
today was to attract more investment in key projects, primarily 
in the fuel and energy complex and in gold-mining. 
  He admitted that although the republic annually mined up to 
50 tons of gold and nearly 90 tons of uranium, it had no policy 
of managing gold and currency reserves and securities.

  [Text] Riga, January 25 (LETA) -- On Monday [24 January] 
the Latvian Foreign Minister, Georgs Andrejevs, and Defence 
Minister, Valdis Pavlovskis, met the U.S. delegation that 
included the Deputy Defence Undersecretary for European and the 
NATO affairs, Joseph Kruzel, the head of Eastern European 
Department of the U.S. State Department, Terry Snell, and other 
military officials. According to the press service of the 
Latvian Foreign Ministry, the delegation has come to Latvia to 
discuss possible cooperation between Latvia and the United 
States in military sphere as well as in security issues. 
  Andrejevs voiced his concern about the security of Latvia, 
particularly in respect of the radar base in Skrunda, because 
the presence of such site on the Latvian territory might cause 
various misinterpretations and incidents. The U.S. delegates 
said that, if the Latvian security was threatened, Latvia could 
consult with NATO and make use of the opportunities offered by 
the programme "Partnership for Peace". The head of the American 
delegation said that his country understood Latvia's concern 
over its security, therefore the contacts were being established 
to launch bilateral cooperation. 
  The talks also dealt with issues connected with the 
programme 
"Partnership for Peace". Andrejevs said that the Latvian 
Government was ready to sign the agreements on joining the 
programme. The U.S. delegation said that NATO was offering a 
possibility to consult with its advisors in order to find the 
best kind of Latvian participation in the programme. The guests 
also thought that the programme could encourage the Baltic 
States to cooperate on security issues. 
  Speaking about the defence problems, Pavlovskis stressed 
that 
they are mainly financial problems. The U.S. delegates said 
that a limited financial assistance could probably be obtained 
from the NATO.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 25, BNS -- Belarus extradited two 
alleged state criminals to Lithuania strictly in accordance with 
the Belarusian-Lithuanian agreement on mutual legal assistance, 
a high-ranking Lithuanian prosecutor's office official said. 
  As previously reported, Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas 
Jarmalavicius, leaders of the underground Lithuanian Communist 
Party, were arrested by Lithuanian and Belarussian officials in 
Minsk and brought to a Vilnius prison Jan. 15. 
  The arrest and the extradition of the two communist leaders 
to Lithuania caused a political storm in Belarus. Some 
high-ranking Belarussian officials face dismissal. 
  Stanislav Shushkevich, chairman of the Belarusian 
parliament, 
told the Russian Ostankino TV Sunday [22 January] that 
Belarusian authorities had no right to extradite Burokevicius 
and Jarmalavicius to Lithuania. 
  Viktoras Markovas, chief prosecutor of the Lithuanian 
Prosecutor General's Office, said on Lithuanian radio Monday 
that the problem in Belarus is dominated by political motives 
and in fact is an attempt to oust the leadership of the 
Belarusian Interior Ministry and the KGB. 
  The Lithuanian official said "what was undertaken, was done 
in strict accordance with the requirements of the agreement" on 
legal assistance. Markovas was among those who drafted the 
agreement. 
  The chief prosecutor said all necessary extradition 
documents 
were presented to the Belarusian side in advance, Belarusian 
officials considered the request and agreed to extradite persons 
who are not citizens of Belarus and are punishable according to 
the Belarusian law. 
  In Markovas' opinion, Belarusians should have assisted the 
Lithuanian side even more and to help transport the alleged 
criminals to Lithuania. 
  Burokevicius and Jarmalavicius are charged with conspiracy 
to 
overthrow the government and premeditated murder. If convicted 
they face from 15 years in jail to capital punishment. As a 
result of a military aggression in Vilnius Jan. 13, 1991, 13 
civilians were killed and around 700 injured defending state 
institutions from Soviet tanks.

  [Text] Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius met 
With Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt in Stockholm on 24 
January. The prime ministers discussed problems of bilateral 
security and the security of the Baltic Sea region, the 
positions of both countries on the Partnership for Peace plan, 
and the possibilities and areas of cooperation between Lithuania 
and Sweden. 
  We are grateful to the Government of Sweden for the huge 
help 
granted to us in all areas, starting with the Ignalina nuclear 
power station and ending with environment protection, Prime 
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius told the ELTA correspondent. 
  Sweden welcomes the acceleration of the process of 
integration of the Baltic states. The Swedish prime minister's 
evaluation of joint efforts by the Baltic states to strengthen 
the control over the eastern borders, while implementing joint 
projects on the control over the airspace and maritime borders, 
was very positive. 
  Sweden will also help us to organize the training of the 
joint peacekeeping unit. It has been agreed that Sweden, 
together with other Scandinavian countries, will take part in 
the drawing up of a project of a trunk gas pipeline from the 
North Sea to the Baltic states. All the Scandinavian countries 
have interest in this project. 
  We proposed to Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt that the 
Baltic Institute in Karlsten should open a branch in Klaipeda. 
  The trade volume with Sweden in the overall balance of 
Lithuania's imports and exports comprises 3-4 percent. More 
than 70 Swedish-Lithuanian joint enterprises have been set up. 
  Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are setting up a council of 
ministers of the Baltic states similar to the currently existing 
Nothern Council of Ministers, which comprises five countries, 
including the Scandinavian countries. 
  Much attention was given at the meeting to the problems of 
the Kaliningrad region. It has been agreed to give support in 
various ways to the so-called Balladour plan and to aspire that 
a common concept on the demilitarization of this region as a 
guarantee to our security be formed. Dialogue between Lithuania 
and the Kaliningrad region is also important; therefore, the 
possibility of participation in this dialogue by the Western 
experts was discussed. The participation of Western experts in 
the preparation of agreements on military transit was touched 
upon. The experience of Western countries in this sphere is of 
great value to us; apart from this, the military transit through 
Lithuania should be coordinated with our neighbors, Adolfas 
Slezevicius told the ELTA correspondent.

  [Text] Linas Linkevicius, the Lithuanian national defense 
minister, has denied an ELTA report that he had signed a Defense 
Cooperation Treaty with France. Linas Linkevicius confirmed to 
a Baltic News Service correspondent that the text of the treaty 
was finally coordinated during a visit last Friday and Saturday 
in Vilnius by French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure. 
  According to the national defense minister, two 
possibilities 
of signing the treaty are being considered: Either the French 
defense minister arrives in Vilnius, and a corresponding 
invitation has been dispatched, or Linas Linkevicius will go to 
Paris. 
  The counsellor of the French Embassy in Lithuania, [name 
indistinct], told a Baltic News Service correspondent that the 
Defense Cooperation Treaty provided for the training of military 
experts, the exchange of experts, and consultations on various 
aspects of both countries' defense doctrines.

  [Text] Vilnius, 19 Jan -- A letter by Lithuanian Foreign 
Minister Povilas Gylys was handed over to Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias by Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas 
Januska visiting Greece. 
  Gylys stated in the letter that Lithuania called to start 
the 
negotiations on the associative agreement with the European 
Union [EU]. 
  It is noted in the letter that the dynamic development of 
economic and political situation in Eastern and Central Europe 
increases the necessity to create effective forms of integration 
into the European Union for the Baltic States. 
  Lithuania expressed its wish that the future free trade 
agreement with EU should comply with the commercial part of the 
associative agreement. 
  Gylys urged the Council of Europe to adopt the decision 
which 
would allow to transform the free trade agreement between EU and 
Lithuania into the associative agreement. 
  Greece presides in the Council of Europe during the first 
half of the year.

  [Excerpts] An extended meeting of the Lithuanian Procuracy 
Collegium was held today. It discussed the legal situation in 
Lithuania in 1993 and the Procuracy's future work. [passage 
omitted] 
  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas made some remarks 
at 
the meeting. In his opinion, the investigation in the cases of 
corruption and in other cases which cause great anxiety to the 
people are being excessively delayed and thus unnecessary 
tension is preserved in society. [passage omitted] The 
president urged the officials to take all the necessary steps 
envisaged in the law to ensure that the cases of corruption and 
other cases are not delayed. 
  The President again explained his motives for rejecting the 
law on the declaration of income and property. According to 
Algirdas Brazauskas, there are no doubts about the necessity of 
such a law, but a system of its practical implementation should 
be created. The president stressed that the law must defend the 
interests of the state but not (?persecute) certain groups of 
people. In the opinion of Algirdas Brazauskas, a corrected law 
on the declaration of income and property should be implemented 
in several stages. At the beginning, high-ranking officials 
should be the first to declare their property -- the president, 
members of the Seimas and government. In the future, all 
residents of the country should declare their income. 
  Algirdas Brazauskas stressed the importance of cooperation 
of 
all law-and-order institutions in combating criminals and in 
maintaining state law and order. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 25, BNS -- The present rate of crime 
poses a threat to Lithuania's statehood, Parliament Vice 
Chairman Egidijus Bickauskas said after a meeting of the 
Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office collegium Tuesday [25 
January]. 
  Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas said over 60,000 
crimes 
were reported to law enforcement institutions last year and this 
was the highest figure throughout Lithuanian history. The crime 
rate went up by 6 percent last year, but increased by as much as 
25 percent a year earlier, he said. 
  In Paulauskas' words, the preventive detention law allowed 
to 
strike a heavy blow on organized crime, to break up a number of 
criminal gangs and to arrest underground bosses. But around 63 
percent of crimes were not disclosed and sources that supply 
weapons to criminals were not destroyed. The number of 
premeditated murders, robberies, economic and financial crimes 
continued to increased, he said. 
  The collegium's meeting was attended by President Algirdas 
Brazauskas, who pointed out that the press "amuses" itself by 
writing about corruption and abuse of authority among officials. 
He urged law institutions to respond to such accusations "in a 
legal way" and as soon as possible. 
  The president said law institutions should establish closer 
cooperation among themselves and assured the meeting's 
participants that the state "does not and will not grudge" money 
to ensure law and order. 
  Bickauskas, who was present at the meeting, said an 
outbursts 
of crime was provoked by Gorbachev's perestroyka. In the 
lawmaker's opinion, "an absolute denial of Soviet laws" at the 
very start of Lithuania's national revival transformed into 
"denial of order," while constant changes in the legislation 
"stimulated legal nihilism." 
  The parliament vice chairman said law institutions "began to 
waver politically under pressure from both the left and the 
right, and gave up fearing they might be called the nation's 
enemies." 
  Bickauskas said the struggle against organized crime must 
continue, data bases about mafia must be created and agents must 
be infiltrated into criminal structures.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 25, BNS -- The board of Lithuanian 
Social Democratic Party [LSDP] expressed no confidence in the 
government and commissioned the parliamentary LSDP faction to 
start a constitutional process of taking a vote of no confidence 
in the Cabinet during the parliament's spring session. 
  MP Aloyzas Sakalas, chairman of both the party and the 
faction, told reporters Tuesday that the social democrats will 
ask other political forces to back their initiative because six 
members of the LSDP in the parliament will be unable to start 
the process alone. Sakalas said the parliament will consider 
their demand only if it is supported by at least 27 lawmakers. 
  In a statement released last weekend, the social democrats 
mainly criticize the government's refusal to set a more 
favorable exchange proportion for people's savings during the 
introduction of national currency, as well as to draw a distinct 
line between legally and illegally acquired money. 
  The LSDP said the Cabinet does not observe the government 
program that was approved by the parliament, has not worked out 
a program for industry reconstruction and failed to draft an 
investment program.

<F P=106> [Text of the "Defense Doctrine of the Republic of Lithuania </F>
(Draft)"] 
  [Text] The aim of the defense of the Republic of 
Lithuania is to defend the independence of the Republic, its 
inviolability and territorial integrity, as well as to guarantee 
the security of all Lithuanian citizens from external threats. 
The defense concept is the total of political, economic, legal, 
social, military, and other measures that ensure the defense of 
the Republic of Lithuania, its territorial integrity and 
sovereignty. 
  This doctrine is based on the Constitution of the 
Republic of Lithuania, universally accepted norms of 
international law, U.N. General Assembly conventions and 
resolutions, and the principles of the national security 
concept. 
  The defense doctrine contains political, military 
political, and military technological parts. 

<H5>    1.1. The Political Basis of the Doctrine </H5>
  The defense doctrine defines potential threats, the removal 
of which involves the Armed Forces. 
  External threats are established considering Lithuania's 
geopolitical situation, the possible aim of foreign states to 
restrict or abolish the independence and territorial integrity 
of the Republic of Lithuania. 
  The external threats are: 
  -- an aggression of another state or military unions of 
other states; 
  -- a civil war in neighboring states or an armed conflict 
between them that could spread to Lithuania; 
  -- an invasion of uncontrolled military units or other 
armed groups; 
  -- a large concentration of military force by other 
countries at Lithuania's borders; 
  -- international terrorism. 
  Aggression is interpreted and assessed in accordance with 
the 
U.N. General Assembly resolution "On the Definition of 
Aggression" adopted in 1974. 
  The nature of threats decides the methods for their removal 
-- political, diplomatic, military, and others. Priority is 
given to political and diplomatic measures. 
  Strengthening its security, Lithuania cooperates with other 
countries and international organizations on the basis of 
accepted principles of international law: 
  -- superiority of the law; 
  -- nonuse of force and intimidation by force in 
international relations; 
  -- peaceful resolution of international disputes; 
  -- noninterference into internal affairs of other states; 
  -- equality of sovereign states; 
  -- honest execution of international commitments; 
  -- inviolability of borders; 
  -- the principles of respect for fundamental human rights 
and freedoms, and of cooperation among states. 
  The goals of Lithuanian foreign policy in the sphere of 
defense are: 
  -- to integrate with international organizations: 
  1. The United Nations Organization; 
  2. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe; 
  3. NATO; 
  4. The North Atlantic Council for Cooperation; 
  5. The West European Union; 
  -- to reduce confrontation in the region and Europe; 
  -- to cooperate with defense security structures of the 
Baltic Sea region; 
  -- to establish a defense union of Lithuania, Latvia, and 
Estonia; 
  -- to sign bilateral and multilateral agreements 
guaranteeing the security of the Republic. 
<H5>  1.2. The Key Principles of Lithuanian Defense Policy </H5>
  -- Lithuania does not consider any state its enemy and 
does not intend to begin military action first; 
  -- Lithuania does not have any territorial claims, does 
not restrict the sovereignty of other countries, and does not 
seek political goals by force; 
  -- the Lithuanian Army is directed only against the 
violators of the country's sovereignty; 
  -- Lithuania does not produce, deploy, or spread 
chemical, nuclear, biological, and other weapons of mass 
destruction; 
  -- the Lithuanian Army can be used outside the country 
only in accordance with international commitments; 
  -- the state does not tolerate the participation of 
Lithuanian citizens in military operations abroad; 
  -- the Republic of Lithuania seeks the resolution of 
international disputes by peaceful measures; 
  -- Lithuania's territory and air space cannot be used for 
aggression against other states; 
  -- national defense is a universal armed resistance of 
citizens; 
  -- civilian control over military activities; 
  -- international cooperation in combating international 
terrorism. 
<H5>  2. The Military Policy </H5>

<H5>    2.1. The Goals of the State in the Sphere of Defense </H5>
  The defense of the Republic of Lithuania is the 
constitutional right and commitment of every Lithuanian citizen. 
  The military policy of the Republic of Lithuania, its 
military structures, and the manner of their arming must comply 
with the following key principles: 
  -- to discourage a potential enemy from 
aggressive action; 
  -- in case of aggression, todefend the state 
with minimum losses to society. 
  The Armed Forces must stop the enemy, force him to retreat, 
and restore territorial integrity and public peace. 
  In case of aggression, Lithuania chooses suitable modes and 
measures for defense. 
<H3>  2.2. Armed Forces and Military Measures Guaranteeing the 
Security and Defense of the State </H3>
  The Armed Forces of the Republic of Lithuania is a system of 
state institutions, an armed force defending the independence 
and territorial integrity of the state. 
  In case of military aggression, the Armed Forces and state 
management institutions are reorganized in line with the law of 
the Republic of Lithuania. 
  The Republic of Lithuania conducts the policy of state 
security and defense along two lines: 
  -- preparing state institutions and society for state 
defense; 
  -- participating in international processes strengthening 
security. 
  Preparing its society, Armed Forces, and other state 
institutions for defense, Lithuania adopts the following 
measures: 
  -- upgrades the Army and its management system, and 
ensures control over the border and the air space; 
  -- strengthens the defense of the state borders; 
  -- supports social patriotic organizations seeking the 
formation of a proper state reserve of material resources, 
mobilization, the autonomy of armament in use, and the 
consideration of defense requirements. 
  Defense seeks to win enough time for the organization and 
rallying of international assistance. The state defense force 
is rallied to inflict the largest moral, physical, and political 
damage on the aggressor, and force him to renounce further 
aggression. 
  The basis of the defense system of the Republic of Lithuania 
is the Army. 
  The Army of the Republic of Lithuania is created: 
  -- following the principles of international law and the 
experience of Lithuania and other countries in forming and 
upgrading their military structures; 
  -- applying the principle of mixed recruiting; 
  -- considering the state's possibilities and demands to 
sustain the defense force; 
  -- expanding the system of centralized management; 
  -- upgrading the Army structure, technical and material 
supply, management system, and creating conditions for the 
integration with NATO and the West European Union. 

<H5>    2.3. The Nature of Potential Conflicts and War Action </H5>
  In case of an armed border conflict, the latter is 
localized and suppressed by applying simultaneous political 
measures for its regulation. The localization is conducted by 
the state border defense service. 
  In case of an invasion into the territory of the 
Republic of Lithuania, the penetration of the enemy inside 
the country is halted, territorial integrity and the state 
border are restored, and the situation is normalized through 
political measures. The enemy is halted and the situation is 
stabilized by the Lithuanian Army. 
  In case of open aggression against the Republic of 
Lithuania, the entire state defense potential is 
concentrated to repulse aggression, by mobilizing the community 
and all material resources and adopting political measures for 
the acquisition of international assistance. 
  Weapons of mass destruction can be used against the Republic 
of Lithuania indirectly if: 
  -- Lithuania is in the zone of confronting states or 
their groups; 
  -- accidents and catastrophes at nuclear facilities, 
chemical enterprises, and other entities of increased danger are 
caused artificially.

  Drafted following the Lithuanian president's decree No. 164 
of 11 May 1993 on the establishment of a working group for the 
preparation of the military doctrine (headed by V. Petkevicius). 
  [Dated] 15 December 1993 
  Today, we are publishing the draft military doctrine of the 
Republic of Lithuania for public consideration. As Vytautas 
Petkevicius, acting chairman of the Seimas National Security 
Committee [recently elected its chairman] (he is also the head 
of a large expert group that worked on this draft) has stated to 
TIESA, the document was drafted with great care for several 
months. The draft defense doctrine denies the propaganda that 
it is the opposition that is responsible for the president's 
decision to apply for NATO membership.

<F P=106> [Report by Terese Staniulyte: "There Will Be as Many </F>
Soldiers in Lithuania as the State Needs"] 
  [Excerpt] It is common knowledge that Prime Minister 
Adolfas Slezevicius was in Riga yesterday. However, the program 
"Radio Pressing Issues" broadcast a traditional interview with 
him. The conversation was recorded on Monday [17 January]. 
  "The national defense structures have been assigned 130 
million litai from the budget this year, which is 1.6 times more 
than last year," said the head of the government. In his 
opinion, this sum is insufficient to create good service 
conditions for soldiers and to feed them properly. However, one 
should not forget that our state national defense system is only 
shaping up, and there are shortages in many places. The prime 
minister reminded everyone that we received aid from the Swedes 
and the Danes. Therefore, the community has developed a feeling 
that we are dependents. Without such assistance from our 
neighbors, however, the independent emergence of a completely 
new structure of our state would be very difficult. 
  According to A. Slezevicius, after Lithuania has expressed 
its desire to become part of the collective security system 
(NATO), new demands will also be put on the Armed Forces. The 
standards of technology and tactics differ considerably. 
Therefore, according to the prime minister, we must think about 
the quality of our Army when seeking membership in this 
organization. A joint Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian 
peacekeeping force that is being formed now will be a certain 
test to our Army. 
  In the opinion of National Defense Minister Linas 
Linkevicius, the Army's quality depends on its commanders' 
training. That is why dozens of Lithuanian officers are 
constantly studying abroad. Recently, 30 young officers left for 
a training course in Denmark. Our traditional ties with Sweden, 
which L. Linkevicius visited a few days ago, and with other 
states of the Baltic region provide experience in forming the 
national defense system. 
  The minister does not rule out the possibility that in the 
future the Lithuanian Army will be recruited on a mixed basis -- 
from professional soldiers and conscripts. Such a system can be 
accomplished in stages. 
  L. Linkevicius claimed that Lithuania's current Army is 
depoliticized, while the Riflemen's Union and other structures 
are operating outside the national defense system. According to 
the minister, the National Defense Ministry maintains relations 
with them and believes that it is necessary to have contacts 
with the community. 
  The opinion of the prime minister and the national defense 
minister on the notorious story of Army equipment is as follows: 
It is too early to make any conclusions. How will the national 
defense system spend the money allotted to it this year? The 
defense doctrine and its functions define the amount of finances 
to be assigned to it. Minister L. Linkevicius assured that the 
money would not be wasted. 
  The defense doctrine will also reply to the question whether 
the Lithuanian Army is not too large for a small country. The 
defense of borders alone will require a constant number of 5,000 
guards. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Lithuanian Constitutional Court decided on 
Wednesday that the Seimas decision on the main guidelines of 
agricultural reform was in its form contrary to the 
Constitution. The document adopted by the Seimas on the 
initiative of the majority of the Lithuanian Democratic Labour 
Party last June has provoked dissatisfaction of some strata of 
the society and of the Seimas opposition. According to them, 
the main guidelines of agricultural reform were hampering a 
historically just restoration of land property in the country.

  [Text] This morning's meeting between President Yeltsin of 
the Russian Federation and Boris Fedorov in the Kremlin, which 
took less than a half hour, did not have a positive outcome. As 
you know, Fedorov refused to join the reorganized government on 
20 January, saying he would only stay on as Finance Minister if 
Vice Premier Zaveryukha and the head of the Central Bank, Viktor 
Gerashchenko, left the Cabinet of Ministers. Boris Fedorov 
declined the invitation to stay on as Minister of Finance in the 
reorganized government, justifying his refusal on the grounds 
that Boris Yeltsin's offer to him was made without regard for 
the conditions which Fedorov put forward. 
  Boris Yeltsin has accepted Boris Fedorov's resignation.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 26 TASS -- Russian Finance Minister 
Boris Fedorov who resigned on Wednesday [26 January] warned 
President Boris Yeltsin that the new government is staging an 
"economic coup" and is implementing what the disbanded Supreme 
Soviet cherished to fulfil. 
  "An economic coup is taking place in the country", Fedorov 
said in a statement on Wednesday. 
  "Boris Nikolayevich, we pin all our hopes on you. The 
question is not in Fedorov, the question concerns the fate of 
the country which is being determined in these days, in these 
hours. I hope that nobody has illusions that economy can be 
separated from politics", Fedorov said addressing the president. 
  The new government is now dominated by "red industrialists" 
who doom the country to an inevitable collapse and the people to 
decreasing living standards, Fedorov warned. 
  "All this contradicts many official government documents for 
which I voted and for which a fought with former Supreme Soviet 
the dreams of which are now being implemented. All this 
contradicts the course of the president confirmed only several 
days ago", Fedorov said. 
  Fedorov denied claims that his resignation was prompted by 
personal ambitions and dislike of Central bank Chairman Viktor 
Gerashchenko and deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha. 
  "My position has nothing in common with personal reasons", 
he 
said and explained that he resigned because "it is inadmissible 
that people who had inflicted colossal economic and political 
damage to the state, who are resolute and open opponents of the 
course of reforms, keep their positions in the government". 
  "I cannot agree with the turn in the policy which has been 
publicly formulated by the prime minister of late and which is 
being implemented", he added. 
  This policy consists, according to Fedorov, in backtracking 
from anti-inflation work, in increasing money printing and in 
the fact that the government is dominated by "a lifeless and 
incompetent ideology". 
  Fedorov said that the government is now raising the 
inflation 
rate planned for the end of 1994 to 8-9 per cent compared to the 
earlier target of 3-5 per cent. "This means that instead of the 
annual inflation rate of 80 per cent we are being offered at 
least 300 per cent. The gap is too big. Moreover, it will be 
several times bigger in reality", Fedorov warned. 
  "The Ukranization has crossed the Russian border", Fedorov 
said, referring to the deep economic crisis and skyrocketing 
inflation in Ukraine. 
  There is no alternative to the policy of reform and "we 
shall 
soon see that in reality", he added. Sidetracking from the 
course of financial stabilisation will boost inflation, decrease 
real incomes of the population, collapse the exchange rate of 
the rouble to 10,000 at the end of the year, devaluate savings, 
restore shortages of goods, trigger exodus of capital to the 
West, isolate Russia from world markets, according to Fedorov. 
  "At the same time there will be no rise in production, no 
investments, no solution of unemployment problem. This is a way 
to a deadend at the expense of the people", Fedorov said 
predicting that the threat of a social upheaval becomes a 
reality. 
  However, it is not yet late to stop backtracking from 
reforms, Fedorov said and urged the president to do that.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Boris Fedorov by Yana </F>
Yurova: "Boris Fedorov: `It Is More Logical To Return the Union 
Government'"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Today, when all the i's seem to have been dotted 
and the government crisis has spun off into a new spiral, Boris 
Fedorov has again been invited to take the post of finance 
minister. Literally on the eve of this, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' 
correspondent has interviewed Boris Fedorov. 
  [Yurova] Boris Grigoryevich, you have sent a letter with 
proposals to the president. Has there been a response? 
  [Fedorov] There has been neither written nor oral response. 
Apparently he has left this fully to Chernomyrdin. 
  [Yurova] You presented the same proposals at a meeting with 
Chernomyrdin. What, in your opinion, did not suit him about 
your option? 
  [Fedorov] Zaveryukha and Gerashchenko have proved to be so 
close to him that he could not agree to their resignation. 
  [Yurova] Who, in your opinion, will now take the post of 
finance minister and who would you prefer to see in this chair? 
  [Fedorov] They say that the post of minister will be taken 
by Shcherbakov, Pavlov's former deputy. I do not understand why 
Pavlov himself could not be appointed in this situation. 
Generally, it would be more logical to bring back the union 
government. And also replace Gaydar with Abalkin. As for who I 
would like to see in this chair, I will never say, because 
otherwise nothing will ever be offered to this person. 
  [Yurova] Some news media report that you have already 
visited the U.S. ambassador, allegedly asking him to find you a 
place in some international organization? 
  [Fedorov] Absolute nonsense! Our country has apparently 
brought forth the largest number of provocateurs in the world 
and is still using their services. Meanwhile this fabrication 
continues to be aired. 
  I am a deputy of the Duma. I will now work there, think, and 
watch the economic situation and study it. 
  [Yurova] For a long time our parliament has been playing a 
reactionary role while the government has acted as a 
counterbalance to it, as it were. Now that a substantial number 
of reformers are in the Duma, will it be able to play a more 
progressive role? 
  [Fedorov] The correlation of forces in the Duma is such that 
reformers are far from being in the lead. I think that one 
should not expect any great results from the Duma in terms of 
its influence on economic policy. I hope that it will not try, 
like the former Supreme Soviet, to supersede the government. 
The Duma's duty is to stop violations of the law. But in 
current politics the government should have enough independence 
or otherwise it will be impossible to call it to account, as was 
the case in 1993 when the government was constantly blaming the 
Supreme Soviet: It has been standing in our way and therefore 
we have failed to do this and that. A very convenient cover. 
Let the government have all the power, and with it 
responsibility. 
  [Yurova] Do you think the leaders of various factions in the 
Duma will be able to collaborate fruitfully on economic matters? 
  [Fedorov] Some concrete decisions will apparently be made 
without any particular problem. I doubt, however, that all the 
leaders are well disposed toward collaboration. Clearly, the 
communists will always have a position different from the 
others. It will hardly be possible to work out a single ideology 
on economic policy. 
  [Yurova] What is your prediction for the rate of inflation 
and the rate of the dollar in the new conditions? 
  [Fedorov] In the next few months nothing is threatening us 
because all the foundations were laid back in November. 
According to my estimates, recession will begin in April to 
May. Inflation will grow to 30 percent a month. Recently 
Chernomyrdin promised that in the first half of the year 
inflation will be at 15 to 18 percent. I use this opportunity 
to bet that these figures will be at least twice as high. 
Everyone must be responsible for his words. I bet $100. 
  Naturally, the dollar rate will be growing. When the Central 
Bank exhausts its resources, it will stop dumping hard currency 
on the market. According to our forecasts, if the proposed 
policy continues, by January 1995 the dollar will be worth 
between 10,000 and 12,000 rubles. It will be very easy to make 
calculations: one dollar -- one 10,000-ruble bill. 
  [Yurova] But perhaps there is some slight chance of 
prosperity lying in store for our industry: After all, the new 
government is going to hand out credits to industrialists. 
  [Fedorov] Even my opponents from the Economy Ministry, when 
they were questioned by the premier whether production would 
grow if finances are relaxed, responded in the negative. 
  [Yurova] In your conversation with Chernomyrdin, did the 
premier make any arguments in favor of the new course? 
  [Fedorov] Chernomyrdin is not an economist and it is 
difficult for him to make any arguments. Apparently he will be 
fighting with the "sluggish-fluctuating character of inflation." 
I do not know that this means; nor do I understand the meaning 
of "nonmonetarist methods of action." For a normal industrial 
policy it is necessary to have willpower. After all, 
enterprises will have to be closed, the production structure 
changed, and people moved across the country. Why has this not 
been done up till now? I was not responsible for industrial 
policy. The same people will be in charge of it. Why should 
anything change then? 
  [Yurova] Policy in this country changes just like the 
weather, and therefore it is quite likely that in a couple of 
months it will again confront you. What would you say if you 
were again -- for the third time -- invited into the government? 
  [Fedorov] I am always ready. This country is ours and it 
must be helped. The main result of 1993 for me is that whereas 
in the past we knew the economy better in theory, now we have 
seen it in practice. 
  The market economy has been built in the country. And it 
must be regulated by market relations. But it is not clear how 
the old Soviet levers can be applied to it again. Now let the 
"red" economic managers try to regulate it with their 
"nonmonetarist methods." Then we shall see how it will work 
out. I am not sneering. Quite the contrary, I am upset that 
our country again has to face the consequences of other people's 
mistakes. 
  P.S. Boris Fedorov's press secretary has clarified for 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS that the offer to occupy the post of 
finance minister has been made on the same terms. Fedorov still 
sticks to his guns. The question has been left open and most 
likely it will be decided in the president's office.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Bekker article: "Viktor Gerashchenko's Creative </F>
Plans"] 
  [Text] Boris Fedorov, who for a bet showed just how stable 
the ruble was against the dollar this summer, proposed a new 
wager the other day -- the rate would fall to 2,000 a week after 
his resignation. Viktor Gerashchenko picked up the gauntlet and 
stated that the panic on the foreign exchanges had died down -- 
"it was even necessary to buy the currency so as to prevent a 
sharp fall in the dollar." 
  Throughout the year the chief financier and the chief banker 
publicly exchanged caustic remarks or political invective until 
the former put the question quite bluntly: It's either me or 
Gerashchenko. The chairman did not leave the Central Bank, 
noting that he might be prepared to quit if Mr. Fedorov were to 
propose to the government something more valuable than he 
himself [Gerashchenko] was proposing. These poignant details of 
the clash between these two high officials would, in different 
circumstances, be a suitable subject for a gossip column, but 
behind their war of words is a fundamental question -- which 
course of reform will Russia choose? 
  Until virtually the middle of last year the conflict between 
the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry was open and, so to 
speak, across the board -- in monetary, credit, budgetary, and 
currency policy, and on the problems of the ruble zone. 
January's slide by the ruble on the foreign exchanges was an 
indicator of the market's attitude to the merest hint of a 
deviation from the principles of strengthening the ruble. It 
was amazing to hear Viktor Gerashchenko's interpretation to the 
effect that the rate slumped because it had formerly been 
supported artificially. First, this was ruled out by the May 
agreement between the Central Bank and the government "not to 
intervene on the foreign exchange market." Second, the Central 
Bank had repeatedly stated on previous occasions that it merely 
smooths out fluctuations in the rate. And if throughout the 
entire past year 4 billion dollars passed through the market, 
was enough to ensure a smooth fall in the ruble, and has 
suddenly been termed artificial support, why was it necessary to 
throw $1 billion into the Moscow International Foreign Currency 
Exchange in the space of three weeks in January? 
  Yet it is hard to get away from the impression that the 
Central Bank chairman is beginning the decisive round in the 
big-time political game called "change of course." Last May he 
formally abandoned his protracted confrontation first with 
Gaydar and then Fedorov and, as stated above, accepted the 
government's conditions. It was as if he were saying "if you 
want to pursue a tough monetarist policy I wash my hands of it, 
let's see what comes of it." Today not a thing can be said 
against Gerashchenko. Even the IMF, where he has long been out 
of favor, has no complaints about him -- the refinancing rate 
has been raised to a market level, loans are issued only through 
the budget, mutual offsetting of debts is not being allowed, 
circulating capital has not been indexed, and lending ceilings 
have not been breached. 
  Outwardly it is hard to find fault with the Central Bank. 
But the Central Bank can point the finger at the monetarists in 
the government -- the production slump has deepened, investment 
is falling, inflation is high, and the budget is in a bad way. 
"The Finance Ministry is bankrupt," Gerashchenko stated on 
television. He is also talking of a link between 12 December 
and "market romanticism," and proposing that policy be amended. 
It is a more than successful situation for him. Fedorov has 
been removed from the government, and this means that it will be 
easy to bury the Finance Ministry's ideas. Ideas such as 
securitizing enterprises' debts. It will finally be possible to 
restore soft loans and import subsidies. It will not be 
difficult to force exporters to sell 100 percent of their hard 
currency -- and not to just anyone, but to the Central Bank, 
which has an automated control system. Fedorov has gone, and 
so, probably, has the Finance Ministry's intention to 
independently sell hard currency in the marketplace through a 
pool of banks, reducing the dollar rate. 
  Gerashchenko can now play safely. Our reserves may keep 
the ruble afloat for a bit. "But what then?" a television 
reporter asked. "We will try to find other means," the Central 
Bank chairman replied. He is a civilized banker and refrained 
from using the word "administrative" in this context. But Mr. 
Gerashchenko is implying a fixed ruble rate, the idea of which 
was ratified last May by the abolished Supreme Soviet. I think 
it will be no great problem to get Viktor Chernomyrdin to do the 
same thing now. 
  Gerashchenko's exceptional skill is his ability, acting on 
the "quiet," to move things to a point where the only decision 
can be a strong-arm one -- in other words, a political decision. 
This was the case after the bank note exchange in July, when 
there was a high-level flurry over the fact that Kazakhstan and 
Uzbekistan were joining the ruble zone. Then everything 
collapsed at the last minute -- the Finance Ministry managed to 
show that a ruble union would be premature. But in 
December-January the Central Bank, sensing the support of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, acted even more vigorously, expediting the 
unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. 
Boris Fedorov calls the agreement on the procedure for this 
unification signed by Viktor Gerashchenko and Stanislav 
Bogdankevich, chairman of the National Bank of Belarus, 
"provocation on a large scale." 
  The Central Bank chairman's influence over the head of the 
government is now obvious to all. Gerashchenko is a special 
kind of polyglot. He talks to the premier in his own language, 
he is subtle and witty with journalists, and speaks English and 
is very official with IMF experts. But Gerashchenko's main 
political talent, his strength, and the source of his 
unsinkability is his unerring ability to second-guess the secret 
wishes of the country's top leaders. Sensing Boris Yeltsin's 
"Belovezhskaya complex," he worked on the ruble zone agreements, 
cutting through Rutskoy's pathological hatred for Gaydar, and 
presented a balance of payments for Russia with a corresponding 
assessment of the level of capital flight abroad. Gerashchenko, 
latching onto the premier's unquenchable love for centralized 
administration, responded with proposals to organize interstate 
transactions among the CIS countries under the auspices of the 
Central Bank of Russia. 
  Gerashchenko is indeed convinced that infusions of money and 
the restoration of old economic ties will revive production and 
ease the transition to the market by using methods of state 
regulation. An "easy transition" and "state regulation" are 
exceptionally important to him on a personal level too. 
Gerashchenko already has his eye on the post of chairman of the 
CIS countries' interstate bank. If Russia's monetary system is 
united with Belarus and Tajikistan to begin with, and if the 
"offense" felt by Messrs. Nazarbayev and Karimov is assuaged, 
then he -- Viktor Vladimirovich Gerashchenko -- would once again 
be head of virtually the USSR State Bank. And if that post is 
ratified by the parliaments of five or seven countries, then no 
Russian reformers would be able to budge this chief. It would 
be like the lifetime appointment of a U.S. Supreme Court justice.

  [Text] No radical government reform is planned, First Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets said in a statement in Moscow on Tuesday 
following "huge media interest" in the subject. He said any 
government reshuffle was a routine process which should not been 
seen as a change in the reform policy. 
  Soskovets said the functions of his commission for routine 
economic management were widened. It will now monitor the 
rational use of raw materials, transport safety and prices and 
tariffs for electricity, fuel, oil products and railway freight. 
  The commission is also responsible for issuing export quotas 
for vital raw materials and products.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "Aleksandr Yakovlev -- </F>
President's Representative in the Federal Assembly"] 
  [Text] On 24 January the well-known lawyer Aleksandr 
Yakovlev was appointed the Russian president's official 
representative in the Federal Assembly. The appointment came 
some days after Yakovlev had been telephoned by Sergey Filatov, 
head of the president's administration, who had offered him the 
post, saying that the offer had come from Boris Yeltsin 
personally. 
  Asked by IZVESTIYA what his official duties would be and 
what 
was behind the establishment of the post, Aleksandr Yakovlev 
made the following comment: 
  "It is not a new post. It was filled in the Russian Supreme 
Soviet by Anatoliy Sliva, deputy chief of the State Law 
Administration. The functions of the president's representative 
in the Federal Assembly stem from the constitutional rights and 
duties of the head of state in relation to the legislative body. 
As is known, the president is entitled to initiate legislation. 
Moreover, according to article 83, he will submit for approval 
by the Federal Assembly candidates for the following posts -- 
government chairman, chairman of the Central Bank, judges of the 
Constitutional, Supreme, and Supreme Arbitration Courts, and 
also general prosecutor. The president needs a skilled lawyer 
to successfully perform the aforementioned functions. 
  [IZVESTIYA] Does this mean that this is the president's way 
of avoiding constant contacts with legislators? 
  [Yakovlev] Of course not. Depending on the importance of 
the question under consideration, the president will address the 
deputies of both parliaments. For example, he will soon be 
delivering a message to parliament. My role is to help with 
legal advice and consultations, ensure feedback betweenm the 
head of state and the Federal Assembly, and break down 
information barriers. And, if need be, put the lid on any 
conflicts that might be brewing. 
  [IZVESTIYA] How often do you intend to visit the Duma and 
the Federation Council? 
  [Yakovlev] I will have to go there regularly. At any rate, 
whenever presidential draft laws are being examined. 
  Aleksandr Yakovlev is a doctor of juridical sciences. Since 
1975 he has headed the criminal law and criminology sector at 
the Institute of State and Law, where he will continue to work 
on half pay. Yakovlev links the inivtation to join the 
president's team to his recent conspicuous participation in the 
work of the Constitutional Conference as one of the coordinators 
of the group of representatives of the federal organs of 
authority. 
  The post of representative of the head of state in the 
Federal Assembly is an addition to the structure of the 
president's administration. Aleksandr Yakovlev and his 
apparatus, comprising several lawyers, will be located in 
Staraya Ploshchad.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 25 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Dmitriy Volkogonov, 
who yesterday was relieved by presidential decree of the duties 
of defense and security advisor to the Russian president, 
proposes to continue to carry out his previous functions but on 
a "freelance" and unsalaried basis. As a deputy of the State 
Duma, he may not simultaneously be in state service, 
Colonel-General Volkogonov told the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
today. 
  "In consultation with Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Gaydar, we 
decided that I should stay in the Duma, because the "Russia's 
Choice" group I belong to is relatively small," Dmitriy 
Volkogonov said. In addition, he will continue work in the 
three presidential commissions researching into cases of missing 
foreign citizens and of Russian Federation citizens who 
disappeared in unexplained circumstances outside the former 
USSR, and into the use of and declassification of the 
presidential archive. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Yuliya Khaytina report: "Gaydar, Pamfilova, Fedorov... </F>
Shakhray? Sergey Shakhray: `I Could Not Care Less About My Own 
Status'"] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray, former vice premier, is now deep 
in thought on the issue of retaining the post of nationalities 
and regional policy minister in the new Cabinet. Shakhray's 
doubts have been brought about by a rather dubious status 
assigned to him in the Cabinet. Instead of "the man in charge" 
of regional policy, which has been Sergey Mikhaylovich's duty in 
the past several years, now he thinks of himself as a "front," 
just like Gaydar and Fedorov who have already left the 
government. Questions of regional and nationalities policy are 
now simultaneously in the "supreme jurisdiction" of two vice 
premiers -- Yarov and Zaveryukha. 
  Shakhray's efforts spent over the two past years in seeking 
to settle relations with Tatarstan now appear to be simply 
undone. At present, problems related to the future treaty 
between Russia and Tatarstan are being discussed in other 
offices while the minister himself learns about them from press 
reports. "Only after I stated this to INTERFAX did they phone 
and invite me to study the draft treaty," Sergey Shakhray said 
in an interview with MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. 
  The situation that has developed over Chechnya is even more 
unpleasant. No one is paying attention to Shakhray's directive 
not to treat representatives of the Chechen government as 
leaders of an independent republic. Chechnya Vice Premier M. 
Mugadayev visits Viktor Chernomyrdin in a perfectly official 
capacity. "Now the regional leaders, especially from Chechnya, 
do not wish to talk to me. They know there is no way of fooling 
me," Sergey Mikhaylovich comments. 
  Phone conferences with the regional leaders are now held 
behind the minister's back. 
  "I could not care less about my personal status," Shakhray 
says. "But this year the fall of the ruble is threatening the 
collapse of Russia's state integrity. This is evident to all. 
It is sad to see which conflicts are brewing and know what 
needs to be done to `remove' them but have no real power to do 
so." 
  According to Shakhray himself, he has 10 more days to think. 
During this time decisions on the makeup of the Council of 
Ministers Presidium and on the distribution of duties in the 
government are to be promulgated. "Then it will become clear 
what the composition of the executive branch will be like, and I 
will make the final decision," Shakhray says.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "Fedorov May Return, </F>
Gerashchenko May Go"] 
  [Text] The meeting between former Finance Minister B. 
Fedorov and Russian President B. Yeltsin, originally planned for 
Monday and then postponed until Tuesday 25 January, failed to 
take place again. According to information from the president's 
administration, B. Yeltsin will nevertheless receive B. Fedorov, 
most probably after returning from St. Petersburg, and we will 
at last find out how the government crisis connected with the 
protracted formation of the new Cabinet of Ministers is going to 
be resolved. 
  As already reported, on 24 January V. Chernomyrdin went to 
the Kremlin and, as competent sources assert, the discussion 
focused not only on budget matters but also on cadre affairs. 
First and foremost they discussed the vacancy in the post of 
finance minister, a key office in the current situation. As a 
result of this conversation the prime minister's list of two 
nominees remained on the president's desk -- they are B. Fedorov 
and V. Shcherbakov, who is a former vice premier in V. Pavlov's 
cabinet. 
  Before flying out to Orel, V. Chernomyrdin hinted to 
journalists that the choice must be made by the president 
himself. But he has already made his own choice: Either B. 
Fedorov, who is perceived as an indicator of the reformist mood 
of Russia's top leadership, is to be rejected or he is to be 
restored to his post. The premier has chosen the latter option, 
and there were significant reasons for that. Paradoxical though 
it may seem, they are connected with the role of the fourth 
estate in our society, which rose up solidly against the 
government apparatus' games designed to get rid of the 
reformers. According to some reports, during the conversation 
with the president he agreed to B. Fedorov's appointment as 
finance minister directly subordinate to the premier. Why was 
this? 
  Recently economists have been predicting increasingly 
vociferously that Russia is approaching the point of economic 
collapse. In the words of V. Krivov, leader of the group of 
experts under the Russian Federation president, the main factor 
which could lead to a further, sharp decline in production, a 
fall in standards, and an end to food imports is the rapid rise 
in the cost of oil extraction, with the result that the export 
of oil and likewise of coal and timber will become unprofitable. 
V. Chernomyrdin was bound to know about this prospect, and thus 
he hesitated and did not want to shoulder the full 
responsibility himself. 
  At the same time he has not abandoned the idea of an 
"independent" premier. The ostentatious "friendship" with V. 
Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, whose days 
in that post are numbered according to what is being said in the 
Kremlin, may be considered indicative in this respect. V. 
Chernomyrdin's gesture of inviting V. Gerashchenko to go to Orel 
is being perceived there as a clear challenge to the president.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's Choice, by </F>
Mikhail Gurevich: "Yegor Gaydar: `The Period of Reform From 
Above Has Ended'" -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Gurevich] At present we have a new political 
landscape. A president who is ever more trying to play the role 
of supreme arbiter, "the father of the nation." A government in 
which the "practicalists" [praktiki] have effectively 
overpowered the "marketeers." A parliament that is still 
divided into several parts: the even firmer democrats and the 
even more rabid "reds and browns." What next? 
  [Gaydar] It is easier for me to talk about the main, pivotal 
line in economic policy, which will be taking shape in the next 
few months, not about the movement of figures. I do not believe 
very much in the apocalyptic forecasts predicting an immediate 
economic catastrophe resulting from the new government's 
actions. I still believe it will have enough common sense not 
to do what sectoral lobbyists demand. It seems to me more 
likely that the government, under pressure from conflicting 
interests, will pursue a policy of half-measures, half-steps, 
first stepping up the inflationary process, then putting the 
brakes on somewhat. Inflation will be fairly high -- 20 to 25 
percent a month -- and people, realizing the essence of 
inflationary taxation, will start adapting themselves to the 
conditions of inflation, while the process of declining actual 
money supply will naturally continue. 
  [Gurevich] That is to say, instead of an ineluctable, speedy 
catastrophe you forecast a prolonged agony that may just as well 
result in a catastrophe, which this time may break out by the 
next presidential elections. 
  [Gaydar] This development of events may, of course, 
assuredly paralyze Russia's chances of economic growth. If 
someone in fact sincerely believes in the existence of 
nonmonetary methods of combating inflation... 
  If there is readiness to exchange the well-being of one's 
own 
citizens for an expansion of the sphere of Russia's imperial 
influence, one may get mixed up in ill-conceived currency unions 
-- why not? But I am certain that only an economically stable 
Russia with a strong currency could be a point of attraction for 
its neighbors. 
  [Gurevich] I have also heard another version of your 
resignation: It was a combination thought out together with the 
president and designed to bring down Chernomyrdin in the end. 
  [Gaydar] It's like Tolstoy wrote [in "War and Peace"]: the 
first column is marching, the second column is marching... 
  [Gurevich] Do you plan to focus on working at the State Duma 
now? 
  [Gaydar] I am a leader of the "Russia's Choice" 
parliamentary 
faction, and I will use this position to defend policies of 
which I am confident. Presently the actual leverage of 
authority is, of course, held by the government. A compromise 
situation where both lines of economic development coexisted 
within one government is a thing of the past. Society will be 
fully able to assess the results of its work. 
  [Gurevich] The trial-and-error method in this situation is a 
cruel experiment. 
  [Gaydar] The reason I resigned was precisely because 
certainty in terms of responsibility is also an insurance. The 
period of reform from above in Russia has ended; further 
movement will be determined by the initiative and pressure from 
the bottom up. 
  [Gurevich] Back to the State Duma: Some people are leaving 
your faction. 
  [Gaydar] I think this is natural. The situation has 
changed; a faction that was seen by many people as a government 
faction is no longer such, the political landscape has changed. 
I do not see any tragedy in the fact that some people have 
decided that working in other groups would be more advisable. 
An overwhelming majority of the faction members, however, are 
unanimous in their commitment to the program principles of 
"Russia's Choice." 
  [Gurevich] Rumors have been circulating about Gennadiy 
Burbulis' leaving your faction; he is still a prominent figure... 
  [Gaydar] Gennadiy Eduardovich has not said anything about 
his intention to go over to another faction. 
  [Gurevich] Is the president still accessible to you and 
people who share your views? For it turned out that he did not 
even know that he was scheduled to meet with Fedorov on Monday. 
  [Gaydar] I know that the president wants reform to continue, 
that he takes it close to heart. In many instances he supported 
us in resolving very difficult and contentious questions. The 
president works within the limits of reality, though -- he is 
not a tsar, not our Lord, not even a general secretary. He 
should heed the balance of forces in society, think about 
stability.

  [Text] INTERFAX has learned from informed sources in the 
Kremlin that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has issued a 
directive suspending the elaboration of plans for the 
construction of a new parliamentary center in Moscow. Some $500 
million had been allocated for its construction. 
  Former First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar, leader of the 
"Russia's Choice" bloc, had objected strongly to the plan to 
construct the new parliamentary center and the allocation of 
$500 million, describing the decision as one reason why he 
refused to join the reorganized government.

  [Text] Moscow January 26 TASS -- "Two Russian deputy 
ministers of public health and medical industry, who tendered 
their resignation, said they had taken this step out of their 
own free will. Nothing is said in their applications that they 
are resigning because they do not agree with the policy pursued 
by heads of the ministry," Public Health Minister Eduard 
Nechayev told ITAR-TASS, commenting on the resignation of First 
Deputy Minister Aleksey Moskvichev and Deputy Minister Vladimir 
Starodubov. 
  New candidates to the posts have already been found, a 
ministry spokesman told ITAR-TASS. They are doctors of medicine 
and, in the opinion of senior officials, they are skilled 
professionals. According to the same source, the two resigning 
deputy ministers will quickly find employment for themselves. 
Starodubov will probably continue to work at the medical 
institute. He combined that job with working as deputy minister.

  [Text] The leader of the public relations center of the 
office of Russia's prosecutor general, Aleksandr Zvyagintsev, 
said that the rumors circulated lately by some news media to the 
effect that the Prosecutor General, Aleksey Kazannik, is to be 
transferred to the Constitutional Court, are "absolutely 
unfounded." According to him, Kazannik is engaged in routine 
work; he holds conferences on pressing problems every day; under 
his initiative his office is working on ways to improve its 
performance. The plans of Russia's prosecutor general "extend 
far into the future," Zvyagintsev stressed in an interview with 
INTERFAX. 
  According to news media allegations, the man who is likely 
to 
replace Kazannik is Aleksey Ilyushenko, chief of the control 
department in the office of Russia's president. Members of his 
department have said that "these reports are nothing but 
unconfirmed rumors." Ilyushenko himself is currently on 
vacation.

  [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- Former Soviet Defence 
Minister Dmitriy Yazov, one of the 1991 August failed coup 
leaders, now tried for high treason admitted on Tuesday that the 
coup attempt was unconstitutional. 
  Yazov also admitted the unconstitutionality of the measures 
taken against Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev who was 
removed from power and isolated at his Black Sea dacha. 
However, he stressed once again that these measures were 
necessary and aimed at preventing the Soviet Union from 
disintegration which, as he believes, would have been inevitable 
if a federal treaty had been signed by six instead of 15 
republics. 
  He said the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in 
the 
former Soviet Union were extraordinary and much stronger than 
was envisaged by the Law on the State of Emergency. 
  The former defence minister regretted that the number of 
troops brought into the city on August 19, 1991 to help police 
ensure the state of emergency was too small. At the same time 
he added that no combat orders had been issued to the troops. 
  Yazov stressed that he personally ordered the troops on high 
alert, but denied he had ordered Soviet air forces on full 
combat readiness. He noted that all orders to the troops had 
been sent by the command of the airborne troops, who, 
apparently, have overstepped their powers. 
  The court ruled that all materials of investigation obtained 
from Yazov in absence of his lawyer shall be excluded from court 
hearings.

  [Text] Nikolay Medvedev, chief of the Russian Federation 
president's administration for work with the territories, said 
that during a transition period of two years it is essential to 
ensure the stability, unity, and governability of the executive 
authority system both in the center and in the field. Given 
this, he expressed his opinion that holding elections of local 
administration chiefs would be "undesirable," because it is on 
the local chiefs that "Russia's stability and the stability of 
the very system of state authority" will depend.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1337 GMT on 25 January, in its "At First Hand" program, 
carries an interview with Russia's Choice Chairman Yegor Gaydar 
by Radio Rossii correspondent Konstantin Revenko in Gaydar's 
office on 24 January. 
  The first question is on Gaydar's present title and 
position, 
to which Yegor Gaydar says: "First, I am a deputy and the head, 
the chairman, of the Russia's Choice faction. I resigned from 
all kinds of state duties and I am heading on a voluntary basis 
the scientific work at the institute of economic policy, [word 
indistinct], it is called the Institute of Economic Problems of 
the Transitional Period." He recalls that the institute was set 
up in 1991. 
  Asked why the government in general and Gaydar in particular 
were so unwilling to explain to the people where Russia was 
going and what was happening, Gaydar acknowledges that it had 
been "a serious fault." He goes on to say: "Our work was very 
hectic in 1992 . The state had practically collapsed and one 
had a permanent feeling that if one were to stop working for 
just five minutes, things would simply slip through one's 
hands." He continues: "The main problem of 1992 and 1993 was 
that we failed to convince, failed to explain some simple 
things, thus giving opportunities and freedom of action to 
demagogues and liars." 
  Asked to assess the state of the Russian economy at the time 
when Gaydar "fled," as the correspondent put it, Gaydar says "I 
did not flee anywhere, I left to do my own things." He 
continues: "The funny thing is that those who spent two years 
seeking my resignation are now speaking of the harm my 
resignation did." He further says: "There were many questions 
on the reasons for my resignation. I understand that some 
people have no shame at all. They are prepared to implement any 
policy and they are not ashamed of any decisions. I simply 
cannot understand how one can retain one's human dignity and at 
the same time justify a policy which allows no money for 
resolving the problem of nuclear waste -- which we are dumping 
in the world ocean -- but which allows 20 times as much money 
for the construction of a major administrative building given 
that two parliaments, two governments, the union and the 
republican government and party bodies have ceased to exist in 
Moscow." 
"Well, I cannot be held responsible for a policy such as 
this," says Gaydar, adding that what Russia needs is "a 
cost-conscious, inexpensive state with few officials whose 
rights should be restricted." He says that instead of 
arbitrarily handing out grants, licenses, and subsidies, they 
should elaborate rules to be adhered to in all cases and control 
their observance. 
He says that there are those who think Russia needs a large 
state which actively interferes in the economy, with a large 
army of officials and in times of trouble Russia has often 
reacted in this manner. He says that it sometimes yielded 
results, but it often led Russian into a historical blind alley 
from which it was extremely difficult to extricate itself. 
  "It is my deep conviction that the time has now come for us 
to extricate ourselves from this blind alley we are in and to 
proceed along a path which has actually ensured success for a 
majority of civilized states, where society is dominant over the 
state, rather than the other way around." Acknowledging that 
this was a problem for Russia, Gaydar said it must be tackled. 
"An army of corrupt officials, in cahoots with a part of the 
new bourgeoisie that is interested in receiving handouts from 
them represents the factor that is capable of paralyzing through 
and through any potential for development, simultaneously 
exacerbating constantly the most acute social problems, 
inequality, and dissatisfaction", he said. 
  Asked about the current situation, Gaydar said he is "deeply 
convinced that despite all the tremendous difficulties we are 
now coming up against, despite the whole seriousness of the 
current situation, the situation is, of course, much better than 
at the end of 1991." He says that at the end of 1991, Russia 
had enough grain to last until February and Russia was 
completely dependent on imports. This year Russia has major 
grain reserves, although there are various marketing 
difficulties. 
  Continuing his comparison, Gaydar says that "hard currency 
reserves as at the end of 1991 were nil; there were no hard 
currency reserves at all, while as at the end of 1993 they 
amounted to $4.5 billion" and these "modest" reserves ensured 
that we could pay for up to two months of imports. "We have a 
major trade surplus and for the first time Russia ceased to 
depend on many imports," Gaydar says, adding that this created 
preconditions for further stabilization. 
  He further says: "We left the country in a situation in 
which wages are $100 per month. This is not an indicator of 
greater prosperity and it would not be correct to regard it as 
such, because wages measured in dollars, of course, fail to 
reflect greater prosperity, but it is indicative of the 
stabilization of our domestic currency and of the extent to 
which the country's economy has become a part of the world 
market." 
  Hyperinflation causes wages to fall to around $10 per month 
as is currently the case in the former Yugoslavia and in Ukraine 
and as was the case in Russia at the end of 1991 "when wages 
amounted to seven dollars per month." "In December inflation 
amounted to 12 percent, a record low," Gaydar adds. 
  Defense orders used to play a tremendous role in the 
country's economy which has now adapted itself to a much lower 
level of these orders and is geared much more towards consumer 
needs which will improve in quality as they have to compete with 
high quality foreign consumer goods. This process of economic 
restructuring is only in its inception, but it is a promising 
trend, Gaydar claims. 
  Gaydar then states that demilitarization of the economy 
altered supply and demand and what is now needed is to finance 
investments in the economy. He feels this can be done through 
increased taxation and that the state "is currently taking a lot 
of taxpayers' money for itself, because we have a huge defense 
expenditure, reduced a bit, but you can not reduce it all in one 
go; one must realize this quite clearly. We continue to have 
serious expenditure to finance an ineffective agriculture and we 
have a whole lot of serious structural problems in the economy 
and it is not possible to cope with all this in one go and in 
conditions such as these to finance an ambitious and large-scale 
program of economic restructuring into the bargain is simply 
tantamount to making taxes prohibitive and such taxation does 
not exist." But economic investments can also be financed 
through voluntary contributions from the population, as is the 
case in Japan, where the state's investments in the economy are 
minimal, but where people save a lot and their money, through 
the banking system, is invested in the economy, Gaydar explains. 
  Gaydar continues: "If I was asked when will the Russian 
economy begin to grow, my answer would be, quite simply, that 
this process will start when voluntary savings of the population 
begin to increase substantially in our country." This would not 
be possible if inflation devalued savings by 20 percent a month. 
"So, when we say that we need to stop price increases, it is 
not because we are some kind of blinkered idealists, but because 
we simply do know how development of production is financed, as 
distinct, perhaps, from our opponents," Gaydar says. Inflation 
endangers production growth, but Gaydar says he is not overly 
inclined to believe that an economic disaster was looming, 
because the market mechanisms are in place and, he states, "I do 
not believe that the current Government will start making one 
silly and fatal error after another." Gaydar says he does not 
believe that the government would cause hyperinflation in the 
country, nor does he believe that the dollar would reach 20,000 
rubles. 
  Asked about his forecasts, Gaydar says: "I think that the 
new government's policy will, to a large extent, be a policy of 
vacillation. The government will endeavor to hold inflation in 
check and, at the same time, overcome by a passionate desire to 
increase production, before pre-conditions have been created for 
this to happen, the government will throw all its resources 
towards supporting individual industries, especially when it 
finds itself under powerful lobby pressure. It will hand out 
promises of financial support and will subsequently come up 
against tremendous difficulties, unable to fulfill its promises. 
It will vacillate between a sharp increase in protectionism and 
the necessity of ensuring that consumers' elementary interests 
are met. In short, it seems to me that this policy will be very 
difficult to form, subject to powerful pressures and that it 
will, to a large extent, be a contradictory policy". This 
policy can preserve the present status quo in which inflation is 
not high enough to destroy the fiscal system and bring market 
mechanisms to a standstill and nor is it sufficiently low to 
stimulate growth through savings being invested in the national 
economy. He says that against this backdrop some officials can 
be in cahoots with a part of the new bourgeoisie, interested in 
the emergence of a protectionist, paternalistic state. 
  He concludes by saying that Russia is facing a choice 
between 
the all-powerful state endeavoring to solve the problem of 
economic development and breaking out of the "vicious circle of 
our history," making the state serve society and creating an 
open and competitive economy.

  [Text] Moscow January 26 TASS -- The office of the Russian 
prosecutor general instituted criminal proceedings on Wednesday 
against nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy for propaganda 
of war which is punishable under Article 71 of the Russian 
Criminal Code, TASS learned from the press office of the Russian 
prosecutor general. 
  The article envisages a prison term from three to eight 
years. 
  The criminal proceedings were instituted in connection with 
a 
letter of noted human rights activist and deputy editor-in-chief 
of the "New Times" weekly Kronid Lyubarskiy to Prosecutor 
General Aleksey Kazannik in which he said that Zhirinovskiy's 
book "The Last Leap to the South" contains open appeals to war. 
  "The author of the book advocates the unleashing of an 
aggressive war against countries neighbouring on Russia -- 
Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan", Lyubarskiy said. 
  "In connection with received statements and appeals and with 
the examination of facts cited there the office of the 
prosecutor general instituted criminal proceedings on Wednesday 
against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on charges envisaged by Article 
712 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation -- the 
propaganda of war", the press service of the prosecutor's office 
said. 
  Zhirinovskiy is a member of the State Duma and possesses 
immunity, however Lyubarskiy said this cannot free him from 
criminal proceedings as the crime was committed before he was 
elected. Lyubarskiy recalled that two organisers of the abortive 
Soviet 1991 coup who were elected to the new parliament still 
face trial and the court refused to drop the criminal 
proceedings against them while the prosecutor's office did not 
appeal against the court ruling.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 25 January broadcasts its regular program 
"Details" presented by Nikolay Svanidze who comments on the 
Russian Federation defense budget, which is currently in the 
pipeline. This is followed by an exclusive interview with 
Russian Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin. 
  Kokoshin begins by saying that in its present situation 
Russia needs a new armaments program but drawing it up is 
extremely difficult. Asked by the announcer if the Finance 
Ministry had been putting obstacles in the way of the program, 
Kokoshin said: "I would not like to criticize this particular 
ministry because I have a full understanding of their position: 
They had a clear task of reducing inflation by monetarist 
methods, and this resulted in chronic underpayments in 
practically all the main spheres covered by the budget, 
including the Defense Ministry. We had some disagreements in 
1993, sometimes quite bitter, but at the same time, I realize 
that their life is not easy either. It is another matter that 
we need to look for new forms of more stable financing." 
  Svanidze then recalls that President Yeltsin had promised to 
pay state-owned enterprises all the money owed to them by the 
state by 1 February, and asked Kokoshin if that promise would be 
fulfilled. Kokoshin says: "I believe that it will be fulfilled, 
but the question is to what extent. Just now complicated work 
-- or I might as well call it violent struggle -- is in progress 
about who should get their money first and how much of it. We 
order for defense." 
  Asked by the announcer about his personal standpoint when 
discussing the budget in the government, and if he was capable 
of reconciling the requirements of the defense industry with the 
awareness that it is a burden on the national economy, Kokoshin 
replies: "We have no wish to form our budget through robbing our 
own country, and I can tell you that in the past too much money 
was invested in the defense industry, and often those were 
rather imprudent investments. Now the pendulum has swung in the 
opposite direction. I think one of my tasks, and those of my 
colleagues, is to prove that the pendulum should be brought to a 
more balanced position, and that our Armed Forces should be 
equipped as they deserve." 
  Finally, Svanidze asks Kokoshin how he thought the current 
government reshuffle would affect the defense budget. Kokoshin 
replies: "In my opinion, the approach we had before was really 
too monetarily oriented, and I have also argued -- both at the 
open and closed sessions with Boris Fedorov and with other 
adherents of this approach. I think it insufficient, to put it 
mildly, and I hope that we will at last begin to stimulate 
industry.

"...And Then There Was This Big Bang"] 
  [Text] We Expect GI's 
  As reported by a high-ranking officer of the Russian General 
Staff, the details of maneuvers involving Russian and U.S. units 
are under active discussion in the military department. 
According to preliminary information, these maneuvers could 
take place in the Volga Military District in the summer. The 
idea put forward by U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev of holding maneuvers in Germany, 
which was discussed during their recent meeting in the FRG, did 
not, to put it mildly, find support among the Germans who, 
according to the officer's account, are not at all keen on 
having Russian and American tanks rumbling under the windows of 
their homes as in 1945. 
  It is expected that the U.S. Army's 3d Mechanized Infantry 
Division and the Russian Army's 27th Motorized Infantry will 
take part in the maneuvers. However, according to the latest 
information, each side will send only 500-700 servicemen to the 
maneuvers. The very small number of participants in the 
proposed exercises is due to the Russian military department's 
difficult financial situation. "However, high-ranking military 
officials are today discussing a compromise solution whereby the 
Americans would assume the bulk of the cost," the officer stated. 
  At the same time, according to the officer's information, 
General Staff analysts are seriously concerned that the top 
Russian military leadership could face serious protests from the 
population of the Volga region and find itself the focus of 
unprecedenteed conflict in connection with the preparation of 
the exercises. According to information being received by the 
Russian General Staff, the idea of joint maneuvers in the United 
States has had a mixed response. 

<H5>    Off to the States in High Spirits </H5>
  According to unofficial information, more than 200 Russian 
generals and other officers visited the United States in 1993. 
Short courses, seminars, symposiums, and conferences make up a 
far from complete list of the aims of their visits. Even 
according to the roughest estimates, it cost the U.S. Department 
of Defense a considerable amount of money to look after the 
Russians. Many Russian generals frequently visit the American 
continent in circumvention of the law forbidding representatives 
of leading state organs to travel abroad at the host side's 
expense. 
  Staff in the appropriate agencies who had initially informed 
the Main Intelligence Directorate [GRU] about secret Pentagon 
plans to work with top Russian Armed Forces military staff 
eventually gave up. It is impossible for ordinary operational 
staff to fight against generals, even those violating the 
Russian president's edict. 

<H5>    The Sick Serve in the Army </H5>
  As reported by a high-ranking officer from the defense 
minister's immediate entourage, members of the Russian 
Federation Security Council who attended the 19 January Security 
Council session were misled when informed that Pavel Grachev was 
absent because he was "carrying out a task for the president." 
In actual fact, according to this officer's account, Grachev 
was in a military hospital on the outskirts of Moscow. It is 
noted that this is not the first time that the 46-year-old army 
general, who always gives the appearance of being hale and 
hearty, has had health problems. Subordinates recall in this 
regard one of the minister's favorite phrases: "The sick don't 
serve in the army." It is noteworthy that often Grachev's 
indisposition is carefully covered up in the Defense Ministry 
and coincides with his reporting to the top organs of state 
power. 
  Russian Defense Ministry Press Secretary Yelena Agapova 
denied the report of Pavel Grachev's illness. 
  At the same time the likelihood of Grachev's removal from 
the 
post of minister in the near future is remote, according to 
information stemming from circles close to the Russian president. 
  Remember Afghanistan, Comrade? 
  As reported at the press service of the CIS Joint Armed 
Forces High Command, Colonel Viktor Timofeyev, commander of the 
201st Russian Motorized Infantry Division, which is stationed in 
Tajikistan, was recently removed from his post. The reason for 
this was not reported; however, sources in the military 
department suggest that Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander 
of the CIS Coalition Peacemaking Forces in Tajikistan, played a 
considerable role here. 
  In the opinion of those sources, it was not difficult to 
find 
a formal reason for Timofeyev's removal from his post: 
Discipline in the division has not been not brilliant, to put 
it mildly, the vaunted contract personnel's actions are 
unpredictable, and several serious incidents connected, among 
other things, with drunkenness among the personnel have occurred 
of late. However, it is thought that one of the main reasons 
for the conflict lies in the differing approaches to the 
peacemaking forces' actions in Tajikistan. Timofeyev, who comes 
from Leninabad Oblast and has a pretty good knowledge of the 
language and customs of the local population, advocated maximum 
neutrality on the part of the division and noninterference in 
the internal affairs of an independent state and was also 
opposed to expansion of the Russian military presence there. 
Pyankov, however, is regarded as a supporter of a tougher 
approach, and his stance could be summed up by the phrase: "If 
we have signed a treaty with the present government we should 
stop any incursions by gummen." Such a standpoint was typical 
of Soviet generals in Afghanistan. 

<H5>    Announcement! </H5>
  It is no secret that Russia has drastically cut back on its 
arms sales in recent years, and as a result earns a lot less 
hard currency -- $1.9 billion in 1992 as opposed to $21.2 
billion in 1982. Perhaps there is not enough advertising? That 
is why the first issue of VOYENNYY PARAD/MILITARY PARADE -- a 
Russian military-industrial complex magazine -- appeared in 
January. Printed in Italy, the magazine is as good as any of its 
Western counterparts. Information about the latest Russian 
weapons and their specifications and performance characteristics 
is given in English and Russian. The first issue presents the 
pride of the Russian military-industrial complex, ranging from 
the Ka-50 "Black Shark" helicopter to the "Tor" air defense 
missile system and the "MSTA-S" self-propelled howitzer. The 
magazine has some pretty good writers -- the greetings message 
to readers is penned by Viktor Chernomyrdin. We were pleased to 
see that the publishers took a photograph of one of the latest 
pieces of equipment from KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. 

<H5>    Anecdote? </H5>
  The military carries out a nuclear explosion. The next day a 
general holds a press conference. A Western journalist asks: 
"General, why did you announce yesterday that the yield of the 
explosion was 5 kilotonnes when it was actually ten times 
greater?" The general scratches his head: "We ourselves 
thought it was 5 kilotonnes, and then there was this big bang..."

<F P=106> [Oleg Falichev report: "The Fall `93 Draft Was Very </F>
Difficult. What Will Its Extension Be Like?"] 
  [Text] There is hardly any sense in discussing again in 
detail the difficult situation among the troops due to the 
shortage of personnel. Much has already been written about 
officers doing sentry duty, about the inordinate physical and 
psychological burdens leading to incidents, accidents, and human 
fatalities... The prime cause of this lies in many ways in the 
hitches in the induction of citizens into service and the rapid 
increase in legal nihilism among the population. Finally, there 
is the fact that some provisions of the new Law "On Military 
Duty and Military Service" are not fully operating. 
  All the same, until recently there was no sufficiently full 
and generalized factual picture of the 1993 draft for Russia as 
a whole. The draft's final results were recently compiled in 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff. What do 
these results suggest? 
  Around 70 percent of the planned number of draftees were 
sent 
into the Armed Forces and the military formations of other 
ministries and departments. That is to say, the draft quota was 
fulfilled by roughly two-thirds. A considerable number of 
citizens received deferments or exemptions on lawful grounds, so 
to speak. For example, 50 percent of the draftees [as published] 
were granted deferments to continue their education, 3 percent 
for family reasons, and 4 percent to work in the spheres of art, 
education, or health. But there are also those who found 
themselves at odds with the law and simply dodged the draft. 
There were 70,000 such people in 1993. Criminal proceedings 
have been instituted in 1,531 cases, more than 90 persons have 
been sentenced, and 20,053 have been fined... 
  Figures are dispassionate. But imagine 70,000 unoccupied 
combat posts, weapon operators' positions, and chartrooms... 
How hard it is for the troops to fulfill their appointed tasks 
and maintain combat readiness in such conditions. But, of 
course, this is not the first year that such a picture has been 
observed. Perhaps this is why the government was forced to take 
an extreme measure: to extend the fall-93 draft into the new 
year. It was decided to conduct it in two phases. The first, 
main phase, was completed by 1 January 1994. The second is 
linked with the Russian Federation president's decision on 
drafting into military service all citizens of induction age 
studying in elementary and secondary vocational education 
establishments, including those doing final courses. They must 
be issued with secondary education certificates early, so as to 
be inducted and sent to join the troops by 10 March this year. 
This in turn will help somewhat to compensate for the release 
of enlisted men and NCO's from two service periods at once in 
the fall of 1993. 
  This is a forced measure, let us stress. After all, in 1993 
we managed to induct fewer than 22 percent (!) of the total 
number of citizens on the military register. Is that a lot or a 
little? By way of comparison let us state that, for example, in 
Germany 50 percent of total induction resources are drafted into 
the Armed Forces and a further 25 percent perform alternative 
service. In France the figure is 58 percent, in Italy -- 85 
percent, in Spain -- 75 percent, in Turkey -- 84 percent. It is 
not surprising that the manpower levels of our troops today are 
barely more than one-half of requirements. 
  Alas, the quality characteristics -- including the state of 
health -- of the young replacement forces being sent into the 
troops and fleets have not improved. The number of persons 
unsuitable for military service for medical reasons has grown 
from 5 percent in 1988 to 22 percent in 1993. Why? 
"Unfortunately, the state has neglected this question in recent 
years," Major General of the Medical Service V. Zolotov, chief 
of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Central Commission 
of Military Doctors, stated bluntly. "It is not surprising that 
during the induction process more and more drug addicts and glue 
sniffers are found among young people...." Not to mention the 
decline in educational standards and the increased number of 
convicts.... 
  A situation has come about where the military themselves 
first and foremost are obliged to tackle the draft. Many 
citizens have formed the stereotypical idea that is a military 
prerogative. But it is not the Ministry of Defense or the 
General Staff which carry out the draft but local government 
bodies. The military commissariat officials of are only members 
of the induction commissions. I mention this because 
maintaining the strength of the Armed Forces is a statewide, not 
a departmental concern. In this respect there are examples of 
good work by local military directorate organs and 
administration heads. Colonel General M. Kolesnikov, chief of 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, for example, 
singled out for special commendation the military commissariats 
of Udmurtia, Bashkortostan, Yakutia, Stavropol and Maritime 
Krays, and Vologda, Kamchatka, Kurgan and Kaliningrad Oblasts. 
The draft is less well conducted in the republics of the North 
Caucasus, Tatarstan, and Kemerovo, Chelyabinsk, and a number of 
other oblasts. 
  Of course, today contract-based service is resolving to a 
considerable extent the problem of maintaining the manpower 
levels of the Army and Navy. Some 120,000 contract-based 
servicemen are already serving among the troops. But so far 
this has enabled the manning levels of units to be increased by 
only 10 percent. The Russian Federation president's edict "On 
Recruiting Citizens for Military Service in the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces on a Contract Basis in 1994" was signed 
18 January 1994. Under this edict the Russian Army is granted 
the possibility of accepting a further 150,000 people for 
military service on contract. The corresponding funds for this 
in 1994 are also allocated. In the past, for example, 6 billion 
rubles has been allocated for contract-based servicemen. 
  Incidentally, about money. It is becoming increasingly 
difficult to come by, although there are quite a lot of people, 
it turns out, who wish to serve on a contract basis: There are 
thousands of application forms lying on military commissariat 
desks. Hence, in view of the difficult economic situation in 
the country, the Ministry of Defense has submitted a proposal to 
the Russian Federation Council of Ministers not only to reduce 
the Armed Forces but also to cut their table of organization. 
The T/O had already been reduced by 500,000 in 1991-1992. The 
reduction process is proceeding now, so to speak, ahead of 
schedule by 350,000. Right now the Armed Forces' T/O is over 2 
million. All these measures, and also the replacement of a 
number of military positions by civilians, are expected to 
resolve the problem of manning levels in the Armed Forces by the 
end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995. Col. Gen. Kolesnikov 
stressed that by that time manning levels could stand at 90-95 
percent. By that time it looks as though optimum numerical 
levels will finally be established. That does depend, however, 
on what tasks the state sets for the Armed Forces. 
  One last point. The figures for the 1993 draft provide food 
for thought on many questions raised by our stormy times. These 
include: What will be the Russian Army's social makeup in the 
future? Does the state have sufficient funds to maintain its 
strength on a contract basis? Will it be possible to maintain 
the prestige of military service among young people and in the 
country as a whole? Difficult questions which, obviously, only 
time will answer. But we must all reflect on them together.

  [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- A Meteor-3 meteorological 
satellite was launched by the Tsyklon rocket-booster on January 
25, 1994, from the Plesetsk space launching grounds. 
  The satellite carries Russian-made equipment to obtain 
meteorological and gelio-geophysical information, as well as a 
French-made Scarab device to measure radiation balance of the 
earth and a German-made Prare navigation system to measure 
parameters of the spacecraft motion. 
  The satellite was put into the orbit with the following 
parameters: 
  -- the initial period of rotation -- 109.4 minutes; 
  -- the maximum distance from the earth surface (in the 
apogee) -- 1,221 kilometers; 
  -- the minimum distance from the earth surface (in the 
perigee) -- 1,198 kilometers; 
  -- the inclination of the orbit -- 82.6 degrees. 
  The on-board equipment is functioning normally. The 
control-measurement complex controls the satellite's flight. 
  Information from the Meteor-3 satellite is received by the 
Russian Federal Service for Hydro-Meteorology and Environmental 
Monitoring for processing and use. 
  Alongside with the satellite, they launched a German tubsat 
small detached satellite to test the system of precise 
orientation with the help of star and solar sensors. Parameters 
of its orbit are close to the parameters of the Meteor-3. 
  The Meteor-3 launch commemorated chief designer V. Adasko.

  [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- A meeting of the Russian 
president and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, who refused to 
work in the new government, is expected to take place on 
Wednesday morning and Fedorov may be offered to become the 
economic adviser of the president, TASS learned from 
well-informed sources in the presidential administration on 
Tuesday. 
  According to the sources, the post of the economic adviser 
may be instituted in the near future and it is not ruled out 
that Boris Yeltsin may offer it to Fedorov. The post envisages 
work in the government as an expert or an observer. 
  The necessity of introducing the post and possible 
candidates 
to fill it in may also be discussed at the planned meeting, the 
source said. 
  However, it is also possible that Yeltsin would prefer to 
keep Fedorov in the State Duma where the reformer can work on 
anti-inflation decisions. As a presidential aide, Fedorov will 
have to give up his parliamentary mandate.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin before </F>
his departure for Orel by correspondent Natalya Chernyshova at 
Moscow Airport on 24 January; from the "Novosti" newscast -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Chernyshova] [passage indistinct] Yegor Gaydar's 
departure and Boris Fedorov's ongoing resignation have caused a 
wave of criticism aimed at the prime minister. The majority of 
journalists give the most pessimistic forecasts, while 
newspapers are full of rhetoric questions to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. Today, a group of correspondents managed to ask 
the prime minister these questions personally before he left for 
Orel. 
  Viktor Stepanovich, what is your view of the fact that 
virtually all the media are predicting that the new government 
you have formed will fail? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Well, of course I am surprised by this. It 
seems to be part of your nature or something. We have not even 
started, but we are being buried before we are born. My view of 
this attitude is skeptical. Once again I am simply astonished. 
This talk is not inspiring, it is not about how work should be 
done or what should be done but, instead, it is a call to 
destroy everything outright. I do not accept this. It is not a 
very constructive start if someone believes that it is a start. 
We are starting the new year of 1994, which is quite difficult 
and complex. We will discuss the initial difficulties in Orel 
now, I believe. We are getting ready for a major meeting of the 
Council of Ministers attended by all the regional leaders, which 
is a very serious thing. For the first time in our country, a 
presidential message is being prepared -- we are preparing the 
economic part and I am preparing all the other areas. So I do 
not see here...[sentence incomplete as received] 
  [Chernyshova] Viktor Stepanovich, in connection with this, 
do 
you have differences with the president or do you fully share 
each other's positions or programs as before? 
  [Chernomyrdin] This is the second question. This has been 
especially noticeable in the media of late, which, openly or by 
hints, imply that we have some kind of differences on many 
things, from candidates [for posts], to other matters. This is 
not the case! We did not and do not have any differences, and I 
believe that we will not have them. I am not shifting my 
problems onto the president, this is not my style, I have never 
done that and will never do. But I must say that, as always, 
the president was aware of the principal guidelines, as he 
should be. Regarding fundamental approaches, we agree them, we 
discuss, examine, and determine all of them a good deal -- this 
was and is the case and, I think, will be for as long as we work 
together. 
  [Chernyshova] Did you see the president today? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I did, I met him today. Incidentally, today, 
that is, yesterday, as a matter of fact, we completed the budget 
for the first quarter and today I showed it to the president, 
and we discussed all the approaches to the budget for the first 
quarter once again. 
  [Chernyshova] Viktor Stepanovich, everybody is trying to 
guess the program you are going to use, in addition to the 
monetarist program. There have been many assumptions. 
  [Chernomyrdin, laughing] This, too, is from the realm of 
improvization, to say that Chernomyrdin is giving up monetarist 
approaches as of the New Year. I have not retreated in 
anything. Our policy is truly tough. Incidentally, in no way 
will this tough policy be slackened and nobody should count on 
this. But today we should produce, today we should say that 
there has been enough of spreading things around, today we 
should gather things together. We have completely neglected 
agreements between the government and trade unions, producers in 
relation to fixing prices for production equipment, or fixing 
wages for a certain period. 
  This is very important. This is not a monetarist approach. 
There are many methods and ways today that should promote 
improvement. Interestingly, about debts, this is very 
interesting too, we will pay them back, we will pay them back. 
First of all, we should repay what we have taken. Strange 
people, indeed! We eat, we have taken bread and butter, but 
when it comes to repaying the debts an argument starts suddenly 
as to whether we should repay them or not. They must be repaid! 
What the government has taken for state orders, for federal 
needs from farmers, agrarians, must be repaid. And not only 
this, but all this should be done in a sensible way, within 
reasonable limits. This mechanism, this correlation should be 
maintained but within reasonable limits, since both things are 
bad, we are blamed for both things. Injections and subsidies 
lead to an explosion. This will not happen. At the same time, 
we cannot refrain from giving, for we will bring everything to a 
halt, something even worse, and an even greater outburst will 
follow. 
  The program adopted on 6 August was adopted by the 
government under the president's leadership, it was approved. 
It was adopted at a Council of Ministers meeting with a large 
number of participants and attended by all regional leaders. It 
was developed collectively. Nobody changed it, and Gaydar's 
arrival in September did not signify any alteration to this 
program at all. He accepted it because he agreed with it. What 
Russia's Choice offered in its election campaign was the 
precisely the government's program. So what are we talking 
about? Gaydar did not add anything, we all worked as one, I can 
say it straight, and he cannot deny this. So why this panic? 
What has happened? Why is everybody going mad? Do not worry, 
we did not retreat and we will not. We did not indulge and we 
will not. Everything will be calculated and geared only toward 
the plan and the programs that have been determined. Will there 
be alterations? Naturally, there will be, it is impossible 
otherwise. Thank God, we do not have such [programs] today that 
can be adopted for five years and that is that. We have had 
enough of five-year plans! 
  [Chernyshova] Viktor Stepanovich, here is my last question. 
Stanislav Shushkevich told me in an interview that he expected 
to see you in Belarus late this month. Have your plans changed? 
  [Chernomyrdin] They have, but only in the sense that there 
is 
not enough time, and we have not done everything yet in order to 
sign documents with Belarus. This visit will take place by all 
means. We are preparing for it, and the ballyhoo that has been 
raised partly in Belarus around our relations, between Russia 
and Belarus, is absolutely out of place. It is harmful, in my 
view. Some people wish to divide us even further but this will 
not happen. We will do everything possible, both with Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, and others. A document on creating an economic 
union has been signed. We are not retreating from anything! 
What kind of people are we? Why is it that every possibility is 
being used to accuse us of doing one thing while forgetting 
another? Nothing has been done at the expense of Russia or the 
Russians ever, the same way as we do not reckon to live at the 
expense of the Belarusians, Kazakhs, Ukrainians. This was never 
the case, it is not, and will not be! I care least of all today 
about the political coloring. I care about practical deeds and 
results today, the way we live and are going to live. 
  Therefore, I will listen to people, I will consult with 
them, 
and I will accept proposals from anyone who wishes to do good 
for Russia and Russians. And I would like to say again: Some 
people just cannot help croaking -- everything will now be 
squandered, trouble is coming! No way! We will not get far 
with complaining and whining! 
  [Chernyshova] Thank you. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report under the "Details" rubric: </F>
"Government's Personnel Problems. Dubinin and Shcherbakov 
Tipped To Head Finance Ministry"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the president and the prime minister held 
the final meeting on forming a new government. Small wonder 
that the last, decisive seat in the Cabinet of Ministers -- the 
post of finance minister, which Boris Fedorov has reserved for 
himself for the period in which a financial report for 1993 will 
be written -- remains effectively vacant. 
  One may hold any opinion about Fedorov. Drawing on recent 
reports you may keep dispelling as long as you wish the myth 
about trends that prompted the former minister to do what he has 
been doing. What may appear to be the finance minister's overly 
spectacular line of conduct, however, has transformed the post 
of finance minister from a work place into a crown of thorns of 
a great reformist martyr. If this trend is to be followed, 
finding a replacement for Boris Fedorov will be fairly easy. 
The more so because the Fedorov-style activity (refusals to pay 
money according to the government's own estimates, delays in 
paying wages, depositing money in commercial banks) will hardly 
be possible if the would-be finance minister lacks a deputy 
prime minister's title. 
  Hence, both owing to the demotion and the postponed budget 
deficit (government debts to the agro-industrial and the 
military-industrial sectors), the minister's seat will no longer 
be a pedestal for a charismatic figure. The important, 
influential (and credit-disbursing) post of finance minister can 
only be occupied by a person from Viktor Chernomyrdin's team. 
Moreover, the candidacy will have to be approved by Viktor 
Gerashchenko. The West's opinion, which was not heeded when 
forming the bulk of the cabinet, is no longer decisive for a 
whole number of reasons. 
  At present, two candidates are being publicly broken in: 
from among Boris Fedorov's deputies, the Central Bank-backed 
Sergey Dubinin (albeit "smeared" by the GAZ scandal, which Boris 
Nemtsov would not let die out), has been nominated for 
promotion, and at the same time a rumor has been spread about 
former Deputy Council of Ministers Chairman Vladimir 
Shcherbakov's possible appointment to the post. As for the 
latter, it can be said that he, like many other former 
government officials, has not squandered a certain clout he 
wielded at the Council of Ministers; meanwhile, following his 
dismissal he set up the "Interprivatizatsiya" fund, through 
which billion-dollar foreign investments are being attracted to 
the former USSR. On New Year's eve, television viewers could 
watch his address as chief of a large investment fund. This 
candidacy is preferable in terms of publicity than is Dubinin's, 
to say nothing of the fact that it may be the most 
"market-oriented" one compared to all other options -- 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA readers could see that point: in an article 
entitled "Management, Technology, Money: Only in This Sequence 
Will We Be Able To Integrate Ourselves in the World Economy" 
(No. 105 of 8 June 1993) we wrote about his views on the 
domestic investment climate and the transformation of Russian 
enterprises' management. What is unclear is another thing -- 
whether Shcherbakov, a successful businessman, will want to 
return to government service. 
  The new finance minister will have to untangle a web of 
"Fedorov's contradictions' and to bear responsibility for rising 
inflation, for which those who had created a semblance of 
"monetarism" by postponing the budget deficit are also to blame, 
at least in part. The pro-radicalist press campaign of active 
opposition to Fedorov's successor was just as inevitable and 
ineluctable as strikes and credit commission meetings. 
Furthermore, although for a person of purely state interests a 
ministerial post means a realistic opportunity to influence 
decisionmaking on specific matters, the assumption of this 
responsibility can scarcely open up bright prospects for the 
office holder; filling the last vacancy in the cabinet 
(discounting Panfilova's seat) is turning into one of the most 
serious personnel problems.

  [Text] President of the Interprivatization Fund Vladimir 
Shcherbakov has denied media reports alleging that he is one of 
the candidates to the post of Russian Finance Minister. 
  "I have nothing to do with the current publicity over my 
name. Any information about my claims for the post is false," he 
said in a statement to Interfax on Tuesday. 
  Shcherbakov said his plans did not provide for a political 
comeback. "For the past two and a half years," he said, "I have 
been trying to distance myself from any political or public 
activity and any contacts with parties or movements." 
  Nor did he accept proposals from various alliances to join 
them or stand as their candidate in general elections. 
  "This does not mean I do not care for Russia's interests," 
Shcherbakov said, pledging commitment to the country's cause. 
  He says his job with the Fund, which is among Russia's 
leading investment companies, is no less useful than his 
previous government post. He spoke of being quite satisfied 
with his social standing and having no ambitions to return to 
politics. 
  However, he accused some mass media of grossly 
misinterpreting his meeting with government officials, including 
a recent meeting with Boris Fedorov. 
  "We have known each other for a number of years. That is why 
I thought it possible to try to persuade him to lift some of his 
demands which are clearly unacceptable both to the President and 
Prime Minister," Shcherbakov said. He spoke of undue agitation 
being caused by the minister's demands and of having tried to 
persuade Fedorov to remain as Finance Minister. 
  However, he went along with Fedorov's demand to be given the 
job of First Deputy Prime Minister as well. This will help 
raise his responsibility for the country's finances and budget 
and vest him with appropriate powers without which the concept 
of personal responsibility is hollow, Shcherbakov said. "My view 
on this does not depend on who exactly will take up the post," 
he said. 
  In conclusion, Shcherbakov appealed to the public not to try 
to make his name the subject of political controversy, pledging 
all possible help to the government, but on a voluntary basis.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 24 January carries an edition of the 
"Details" program. The program's announcer, Nikolay Svanidze, 
addresses two main issues relating to the government reshuffle: 
Will an additional first deputy prime minister be appointed 
alongside Oleg Soskovets? Who will be appointed to the key post 
of finance minister? In the studio with Svanidze is one of the 
main candidates for the post of finance minister, Vladimir 
Ivanovich Shcherbakov, chairman of the Council of Directors and 
president of the Interprivatizatsiya Foundation. 
  When asked by Svanidze about a possible nomination as 
finance 
minister, Shcherbakov says, "I hope I am not appearing here as a 
candidate for the ministerial post. That is of little interest 
to me. Speaking seriously about the finance minister post, it is 
no accident that the name Valentin Pavlov is mentioned. What is 
needed today is a man who can say yes or no pretty firmly, and 
who can stick with it. I had a fairly lengthy talk today with 
Boris Fedorov. My point of view is this: He should stay in his 
post, that was what we were talking about." 
  Svanidze then asks Shcherbakov if he has persuaded Fedorov 
to 
stay on. "Well, yes, that was chiefly what we were talking 
about," says Shcherbakov. 
  On the unification of Belarus and Russian currencies, 
Shcherbakov says that the accord signed was more of a strategic 
pointer than a practical document to be implemented urgently. 
The accord was drawn up by the Central Bank, which is legally 
responsible for regulating currency circulation, though it was 
previously not the case, Shcherbakov says, for one government 
department to draw up such accords. Asked whether the finance 
ministry was bypassed on the decision, Shcherbakov says he 
cannot comment on the situation, which he regards as "the 
internal affair of the government". 
  Regarding inflation, Shcherbakov makes the proviso that "I 
would not wish my words to be taken as being any claim to 
becoming the finance minister," and says that he agrees with 
Chernomyrdin. "Chernomyrdin was right when he said that 
monetarist methods must be augmented by an arsenal of other 
methods. I believe that is the right way to put it. First and 
foremost, legislative measures: We must curb inflation using 
legislative methods, and by further improving the laws governing 
economic activity. Second, organizational measures: namely, for 
instance, the transport infrastructure does not work; the 
payment infrastructure does not work. We have simply stopped 
payments, but not for economic reasons, rather for political and 
organizational reasons." Shcherbakov concludes that he is 
profoundly convinced that "inflation is engendered by the 
non-market structure of our economy."

  [Text] By order of Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Economics 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, as a member of the government's 
presidium, is temporarily in charge of the ministry for 
cooperation with the CIS states, Shokhin himself told 
journalists on Monday. 
  According to Shokhin, "Vladimir Mashitz will be responsible 
for the economic affairs in the ministry." As for Konstantin 
Zatulin, a member of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord] faction in the State Duma, of which Shokhin is a member) 
[no open parentheses as received], he is the head of the Duma's 
Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties with Compatriots. Shokhin 
has no information about the nomination of Zatulin as the 
minister for cooperation with the CIS states. 
  As it was reported earlier, Shokhin was also appointed the 
Economics Minister. 
  Shokhin hopes that the Economics Ministry will have "real 
authorities, although this does not mean the revival of GOSPLAN 
(the State Planning Committee)." Shokhin also expressed hope 
for the real interaction with the Finance Ministry reminding 
that in the past the two ministries had different approaches to 
the resolution of economic problems and public discussions took 
place which the new economics minister hopes to avoid in the 
future.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Volkov, Yelena Kolokoltseva report under the </F>
"Ministers" rubric: "Aleksandr Shokhin Intends To Sum Up 
Abalkin and Petrakov. Ministry of the Economy Will Once Again 
Try To Elaborate Selective Structural Policy"] 
  [Text] Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin stated in a news 
conference yesterday that his department intends to "sum up 
suggestions on correcting the reforms" that had been hammered 
out in particular by the working group under First Vice Premier 
Oleg Soskovets; by academicians Abalkin and Petrakov; by Lvov, 
corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences; by Academician 
Shatalin's "Reforma" fund, and so forth. Mr. Shokhin hopes to 
sum up these programs by early February, when the ministry's 
collegium session is planned. Besides, he is hoping that the 
"designers of formulas for Russia's salvation," for example, 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, "will not hide their ideas until the moment 
they are asked to form their government." 
  Russia's new economy minister, the fifth in two years, 
stated 
the need to "combine the line toward macroeconomic stabilization 
with measures in the field of microeconomy." Mr. Shokhin 
explained his perception of the premier's comments about the use 
alongside with "monetarist" measures of "nonmonetarist" measures 
in controlling the economy. "It is necessary to fill with 
concrete contents the selective structural policy," he declared. 
According to the economy minister, the effectiveness of 
granting preferential credits last year was extremely low, and 
it is now necessary to design a mechanism to issue them on a 
selective basis. Besides, the state should pay up the debts to 
the national industry and agriculture -- "even if to minimize 
the sum, we should pay in the first quarter at least 3 trillion 
rubles under our obligations of last year's fourth quarter. 
This is the most conservative estimate of what we cannot afford 
not to do," he said, adding that all this "does not contradict 
the financial policy guidelines." 
  Aleksandr Shokhin rejected the explanation given by Yegor 
Gaydar for his resignation (Mr. Gaydar referred to the 
government decisions in January that ran counter to the policy 
of financial stabilization). "Inflation in January will be 
immeasurably greater than in December," but, like the growth of 
the budget deficit, this "is predetermined by the last months of 
the past year," Mr. Shokhin stated. He explained the desire of 
a number of politicians to "leave the government" by political 
expediency. As for the present composition of the cabinet, Mr. 
Shokhin thought that the composition of the government would not 
have undergone appreciable changes compared with that of the 
start of September had Boris Fedorov stayed in the position of 
finance minister. "Now is a rather hard time for carrying out 
reforms, but I did not cash in on the opportune moment to leave 
the government because all the horsepower in here is necessary 
now," he said. 
  In the meantime, according to Mr. Shokhin, certain political 
forces are doing "all to discredit the prime minister, equating 
his actions with a creeping counterrevolution" so as "to try and 
organize in April-May an all-Russia strike and take power." 
  Touching on the problem of Russia's relations with 
international financial organizations, Aleksandr Shokhin pointed 
out in particular that "he would not now speak about who 
precisely will conduct talks with G-7, the Paris and London 
creditor's clubs, as well as with the IMF and the World Bank." 
At the same time, the new economy minister stated that he would 
insist on jointly resolving all questions pertaining to 
relations with international financial organizations, and that 
he thought it necessary to preserve the commission for 
cooperation with international financial organizations. 
  Answering journalists' questions about the chances of a 
second line of the system of credit from the IMF for Russia, and 
the granting of standby credit in 1994, the Russian IMF director 
doubted if "Russia would be able in the near future to meet the 
standard set of criteria brought by the Fund's board in deciding 
on granting it." The economy minister, however, believes it 
necessary to continue the talks with IMF representatives on 
these problems. "This is useful at least because thus we can 
see the situation in Russia's real economy," he stated. 
  During yesterday's press conference, Mr. Shokhin was 
extremely cautious about chances for the merging of the monetary 
systems of Russia and Belarus, saying that such a decision 
should be preceded by finding a compromise on a closer union of 
the two countries' economic policies. Mr. Shokhin intimated 
that he would be in charge of Russia's relations with the CIS 
subject to approval by the premier.

  [Text] There are no reasons to assume that the Russian 
government has changed its economic policy, said Economics 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin. 
  The recent changes in the government's composition were 
minor 
compared to those made last September, Shokhin, who recently 
replaced Yegor Gaydar as economics minister, told a news 
conference in Moscow on Monday. 
  But he said certain amendments would nevertheless be made to 
the economic policy on the basis of recommendations by 
economists and politicians. He expressed readiness to cooperate 
with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the 
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc. He said use would also be made 
of work done by a team led by Academicians Leonid Abalkin and 
Nikolay Petrakov and a team led by Academician Stanislav 
Shatalin. 
  As for Boris Fedorov, it was still unclear whether he would 
remain in the government, Shokhin said. He said President Boris 
Yeltsin on Monday did not accept Fedorov's resignation. 
  The main economic problem facing the government today is 
"combining the line towards macroeconomic stabilization with a 
more careful microeconomic policy," Shokhin said. "That is what 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had in mind when he spoke 
about non- monetarist measures," he said. In particular, 
selective financing of economic sectors and tight control of 
taxation had to be introduced, with "budgetary revenues 
drastically increased by administrative methods." None of those 
measures contradicted the former financial policy, Shokhin said. 
  He said the government should not be seen as consisting of 
"conservatives" and "reformers" and condemned "the campaign 
against the Chernomyrdin government, which is run by Mikhail 
Poltoranin," and is a "serious political game" aimed at 
"organizing a nationwide political strike in April or May, 
overthrowing the government and taking power."

  [Text] Inflation will be much higher than in December, 
Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin estimated. He 
believes this will be due to the government's economic policy in 
November-December 1993, including decisions on subsidies to 
miners, increase in wages for state sector employees and others 
made with the participation of Gaydar. 
  "To tell the truth, he (Gaydar - IF) should have resigned in 
November or December when the decisions' adoption failed to be 
prevented," Shokhin told a press conference in Moscow on Monday. 
  He repeated that it would be necessary to repay not less 
than 
3 Bn rubles in the 1st quarter of this year to cover the debts 
of the 4th quarter of 1993. However, in his words, the total 
sum of debts is 2.5 times bigger. 
  According to Shokhin, this means that Gaydar and other 
members of the government have "decided to avoid responsibility 
for the consequences of their policy." 
  Moreover, according to the new economics minister, 
unemployment may increase this year. Now the official number of 
unemployed is about 1 million and the hidden one is about 5 
million. These 5 million may become a part of the official rate 
of unemployment, he emphasized.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yegor </F>
Gaydar by DER SPIEGEL; place and date not given: "A Shock Was 
Needed"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Yegor Timurovich, under what 
conditions would you have remained in office? 
  [Gaydar] If I had sufficient opportunities to keep a check 
on monetary, loan, and financial policies. That is, the 
political fields that our society, but also the whole world, 
always believed to be my responsibility anyway. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You said that the monetary union with Belarus 
was one of the main reasons for your resignation. Why is it 
dangerous? 
  [Gaydar] In general, the extension of the ruble zone and the 
integration of other states, too, are conceivable. But only if 
the coordination mechanisms work very well and the uncontrolled 
printing of money can be ruled out for sure. If, however, there 
are only vague formulations instead, this will, in the end, only 
result in a competition for the faster printing of money. Why 
should the Belarusians deliver something to Russia if they can 
pay for our goods with freshly printed rubles? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is your resignation alone to blame for the 
present, almost free fall of the ruble? 
  [Gaydar] It was caused by a negative change in inflationary 
expectations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Can the new government do something against 
it? 
  [Gaydar] Let us hope that the government will manage to keep 
a check on inflation, without reaching a deadlock. At any rate, 
Russia's complicated problems cannot be solved by new national 
credit presents. However, there is the great risk that 
precisely this course will be taken. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your parliamentary party colleague, Boris 
Fedorov, who has been finance minister so far, also no longer 
wants to participate in the new government. He had called for 
the replacement of Central Bank chief Gerashchenko and Deputy 
Prime Minister Zaveryukha, who is responsible for agriculture. 
Are they the people who forced the change of course? 
  [Gaydar] These demands come from Fedorov. I am keeping out 
of it. It is our joint hope that the worst can be prevented. 
The worse, the better -- this is not our attitude. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will you go into the opposition with your 
adherents? 
  [Gaydar] Our parliamentary group in the State Duma will do 
everything to block irresponsible economic and budget decisions. 
This is all the more important since Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin's statements have clearly shown that he is 
succumbing to illusions that inflation could also be 
counteracted by other than monetary measures. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you also assume partial responsibility for 
having caused Zhirinovskiy's rise by shock methods of the market 
economy? 
  [Gaydar] Failures in the implementation of reforms 
definitely contributed to Zhirinovskiy's success. However, one 
has to be precise regarding the causes of the failures. 
Profound reforms aiming at privatization and price decontrol 
were carried out. However, financial policies always remained 
soft. But they are meant when people talk about a shock 
therapy. As a result of pressure from the Supreme Soviet and 
the regions, burdens that were impossible to fulfill were put on 
the state budget again and again. What was precisely needed was 
a shock. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds as if you had liked to drive even 
more voters to Zhirinovskiy... 
  [Gaydar] ... our polls have shown that those who voted for 
this man come from neither the impoverished nor from social 
fringe groups, but from the middle class: better qualified 
workers, people with handsome incomes. 
  They are not primarily dissatisfied with their material 
situation, but with the lack of order, crime, which is getting 
out of hand, and Russia's present situation in the world. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is there now the danger that, on the one hand, 
Western help will be discontinued, while, on the other, Russia 
will turn away from Western economic and political values? 
  [Gaydar] This is a very serious danger. I am convinced that 
long-term relations of partnership suit Russia's strategic 
objectives best. Here I have always proceeded on the assumption 
that Russia has to solve its problems by its own. No financial 
help from the West, however voluminous it may be, will be able 
to save the Russian economy as a whole. However, Western help 
can mitigate the social effects of our economic problems. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The doubts of foreign financial backers about 
whether their loans are appropriately used in Russia are 
increasing. 
  [Gaydar] Transfers from abroad, however voluminous they may 
be, cannot replace a reasonable monetary policy in one's own 
country. At most, they will result in an increase of Russian 
assets in Western accounts. As fast as the money would come to 
Russia, it would it be transferred again as fast. This cannot 
be prevented by foreign exchange control, but only by sufficient 
economic stability. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will President Yeltsin become a prisoner of 
the parliamentary majority of communists, centrists, and 
right-wing extremists? 
  [Gaydar] I know that the president sees himself as a 
reformer and wants to continue this course. Therefore, I hope 
that he will spare no effort to achieve this objective. 
However, we neither put him on the tsar's throne nor on God's 
throne, but we only elected him president. He has to see how he 
can cope with the new restrictions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And with his opponents... 
  [Gaydar] ...they will introduce draft laws, in order to 
invalidate again all the market and property mechanisms that are 
already effective today. The law on the rights of the work 
collectives alone, which has been prepared by the communists, 
would fully suffice to paralyze the market economy in Russia. 
Moreover, they will resolve a gigantic expenditure that cannot 
be financed. However, the new government will have to answer for 
this. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What is the next target of your ambition -- a 
[university] chair of economic sciences or the chair of the 
Russian president? 
  [Gaydar] The seat at my desk at home attracts me most.

  [Text] Defense Minister Pavel Grachev had no doubts that he 
would retain his post in Russia's reorganized government. Only 
some newspapers and journalists entertained doubts on this 
score, he declared on Tuesday [25 January] at a meeting with his 
Belgian counterpart, Leo Delcroix. The Belgian defense minister 
expressed satisfaction in this connection, since, as he put it, 
Grachev presents "a stabilizing factor" in Russia. 
  Grachev and Delcroix, who came to Moscow for an official 
visit, intend to discuss military cooperation between Russia and 
Belgium, the results of the recent meeting between the Russian 
and American presidents, problems connected with European 
security, the role played by NATO in this, and ways to heighten 
the effectiveness of nuclear non-proliferation. 
  Addressing journalists, Grachev said that he intends to 
exchange views on the American Partnership for Peace concept 
with his Belgian counterpart. This initiative is interpreted 
differently in the world, he stressed. Some people believe that 
all the countries can join Partnership for Peace, others 
maintain that the concept is acceptable only to specific 
countries, and there are those who claim that the concept is 
designed to unite several countries against some third party, he 
noted. 
  Grachev called for determining this issue once and for all, 
and said he hopes that Delcroix will present Russia's attitude 
at a session of NATO's Security Council. 
  The two defense ministers also discussed the possibility of 
a 
joint visit to the former Yugoslavia. As Grachev said, the 
Russian and Belgian peace-keeping contingents deserve high 
praise from the international command. 
  During his two-day trip to Russia, Delcroix is expected to 
visit Russia's strategic troops. He will be the first foreign 
defense minister, particularly representing NATO, to see 
Russia's strategic troops and their combat installations, 
Grachev said.

  [Text] Moscow January 25 TASS -- Two high officials of the 
Russian Ministry of Health -- First Deputy Minister Aleksey 
Moskvichev and Deputy Minister Vladimir Starodubov -- sent in 
their resignations after the appointment of Eduard Nechayev as 
health minister had been endorsed. ITAR-TASS learned this from 
a well-informed source. The source said there is a conflict 
between deputy ministers and Nechayev, so Moskvichev and 
Starodubov deemed it impossible to work under his direction. 
Nechayev has signed the resignations which are now considered 
by the government. 
  New candidatures to fill the posts have already been found, 
ITAR-TASS was told.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1920 GMT on 24 January carries the "Moment of Truth" 
program, hosted by Andrey Karaulov, with this week's guest 
Mikhail Poltoranin, former Russian deputy prime minister and 
currently chairman of the State Duma committee for information, 
politics, and communications. The interview was recorded in 
Moscow on 20 January. Topics covered included the background and 
aftermath of Gaydar's resignation, rumors in the press on 
Chernomyrdin's presidential ambitions, the possibility of a 
general strike this year, his attitude toward Yeltsin, the 
events of October 1993, his own resignation, the election 
results, his past relations with the Russian media, and his 
hopes for the work of the State Duma. 
  Asked about the background to Gaydar's resignation, 
Poltoranin said: "As regards the actual resignation of Gaydar, 
it was no surprise to me, because we discussed this problem -- 
the resignation of his whole team from the government -- as 
early as the beginning of last November when we were preparing 
for the elections. I'm sure that Russia's Choice would have got 
a bigger percentage if this team had distanced itself from the 
government and distanced itself from the mistakes that the 
government made in 1992. Having weighed up all the pros and 
cons, we said that Gaydar cannot afford the luxury of resigning 
just prior to the referendum, because at that time society had 
started getting irritated and as a result of this irritation 
many people would not have gone to the polls, and we might not 
have got the constitution. We set the adoption of the 
constitution higher than our party interests, and thank God, 
we've got the constitution. Now Gaydar has resigned, and in 
principle his umbilical cord was cut long ago and nothing links 
him with the policies -- if you can call them policies -- 
currently being pursued by Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin." 
  Karaulov went on to ask how Yeltsin could let Gaydar go. 
Poltoranin said: "It seems to me that the president himself 
has, in this difficult situation, got slightly disoriented to 
some degree. We're all disoriented. Today we're faced with a 
massive halt to production, of enterprises, and so on, and the 
president is already feeling a sense of danger for Russia. It 
seems to him that a man who has got hold of the economy in his 
teeth -- Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin -- can see more and 
make a more correct assessment of the situation. He has given 
him all the cards, and he is now giving Chernomyrdin the 
opportunity: Go ahead, if you don't agree with this or that, 
sort it out for yourself. There is a question, and I do not 
blame the president in this although to some degree a time will 
come when we shall all have to reflect again on today's actions 
-- say, those of the prime minister and his entourage." 
  Having warned of the possibility of a general strike this 
year as a result of political intriguing, Karaulov pressed 
Poltoranin as to whether he really thought it possible that a 
general political strike might occur this summer. He replied: 
"I wouldn't want that to happen, of course, just like the rest 
of us. But just look at the situation today, what is happening 
in Russia, and you can't rule it out. The figures are large, 
colossal unfortunately. Group B factories are coming to a 
standstill, that is, the ones that produce clothing, our 
personal effects. And there are people, there are groups -- 
I'll cite them in specific terms now -- for whom it is 
advantageous for all this to happen. There are people, there 
are now movements, for whom the worse things are, the better. I 
would include here the movement, or party, of Zhirinovskiy, 
because it's very advantageous to Zhirinovskiy that everything 
should be seething. He's one of those people who like to surf 
across the waves." Asked why Yeltsin cannot see this for 
himself, he said: "The points of view from which we all look at 
one problem or another don't always coincide. Why are reforms 
under way in the Ministry of Security and its structures, a 
search for some kind of normal or acceptable forms? Because 
they don't satisfy the president -- they don't satisfy any of 
us, we don't know and the president often doesn't know what is 
going on. That is, it seems to me he doesn't have enough 
information."
