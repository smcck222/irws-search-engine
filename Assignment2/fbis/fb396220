<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "War on Mafia Far From Over, DIA </F>
Report Says"] 
  [Text] Rome, 5 Jan (ANSA) -- Organized crime has suffered 
several blows over recent years but maintains hold on 
significant economic and financial resources and continues to 
intimidate, blackmail and condition even entire communities, 
according to the half-year report by the Anti-Mafia 
investigative directorate (DIA) which Interior Minister Nicola 
Mancino presented to Parliament today. The Mafia strength, the 
report said, continues to lie in its various illegal activities 
and its influence in political, administrative and judicial 
institutions. Given such conditions, the report warned, 
enthusiasm should be controlled over the recent and important 
success by law enforcement. The DIA report went on to observe 
how a "pure terrorist phase" had been consolidated within the 
Mafia, as evidenced by last year's bomb attacks in Rome, 
Florence and Milan, while the recent confiscation of weapons 
demonstrates how organized crime can count on a significant and 
sophisticated arms arsenal. There is ample evidence, the report 
continued, to assume that leading organized crime groups have 
graduated to major wholesale arms trafficking with transactions 
standing out for both volume and value and involving other 
foreign criminal groups and military-political factions in 
foreign countries. 
  Sicily's Cosa Nostra and other domestic crime syndicates, 
the 
DIA said, have access not only to automatic weapons but also 
military explosives, missiles, cannon, armor-piercing 
projectiles and other weapons. Turning its attention to the 
various crime bosses currently behind bars, the DIA report 
underscored the need the bosses have to reinforce their 
leadership over their subjects and how this explained a number 
of "symbolic" murders. There is also a growing restlessness 
among the imprisoned so-called men of honor who are subject to 
special restrictive prison treatment and do not qualify for 
special permissions, alternative detention and working out of 
jail. This ill-feeling, the DIA claimed, has led many of these 
crime figures, over the past months, to decide to collaborate 
with justice. But this, in turn, has also opened the way for a 
new defense strategy for the part of the Mafia. This defense 
strategy, the report said, included a campaign to de-legitimized 
turncoats and state's witnesses and to spread disinformation. 
Examples of this were the statements by jailed Cosa Nostra boss 
of bosses Salvatore Riina on the "manipulation" of turncoats, 
the distorted interpretation of the American trial against the 
Gambino family and the "heavy and unjustified" attacks against 
magistrates and law enforcement. The Mafia is also seeking to 
induce the dismantlement the judicial approach set up by the 
first anti-Mafia pool, denying the existence of a secret 
association and its executive commission. 
  The DIA report when on to show how a process is currently 
underway to unify criminal financial and human resources and 
stated that evidence exists proving that these "organized 
criminal consortiums" had worked with Cosa Nostra in planning 
and carrying out the most recent episodes of Mafia terrorism. 
The evidence cited in support of this situation included 
testimony by a turncoat and a series of "signals" which 
indicated how organized crime groups in Sicily, Calabria and 
Campania and, to a lesser degree, Puglia had developed an 
intricate network of business and activities. This "horizontal" 
integration of organized crime, the DIA report continued, has 
resulted in an increase in geographic mobility and the exchange 
of assets, duties and capital which has also allowed for 
organized crime to expand abroad. Investigators, in fact, have 
known for some time of the presence of Italian criminals 
operating in France, Germany, Canada, the United States, 
Australia and South America. There has also been repeated 
confirmation demonstrating how the Mafia is expanding its 
activities, interests and investments in former socialist states 
in East and Central Europe. 
  In concert with this "horizontal" development, the DIA 
argued, the process of integrating illegal markets has also 
resulted in a "vertical" development which is not always under 
the guidance of Cosa Nostra. Contacts between various criminal 
organizations are "numerous and diversified," the report 
continued, with "elements of an illegal nature." Evidence of 
this were the proven contacts been Calabria's 'ndrangheta [local 
Mafia-style organization] and right-wing extremists in Reggio, 
dating as far back as the 1970's, and contacts between the Mafia 
and the underground leftist groups. It cannot be ruled out, the 
DIA report said, that pacts have been hammered out between these 
various illegal organizations to "pilot change in the country to 
their own advantage." 
  Looking at organized crime's sources of income, the DIA 
report underscored how racketeering "continues to constitute a 
significant source" of illicit income and, over the years, 
extortion has become a tool to take over companies. 
Loan-sharking is equally as serious, the report warned, while 
there would appear to be a decline in drug trafficking, even if 
it remains today one of organized crime's chief activities and 
money makers. Another area of illegal income, the DIA said, was 
through manipulating public works tenders and taking over retail 
activities. This allows organized crime a "clean" outlet to 
launder significant amounts of illegal profit. 
  In its section on organized crime's links with public 
institutions, the DIA report recalled how, in 1993, 34 municipal 
governments were dissolved for Mafia infiltration and 
conditioning; ten in Sicily, two in Calabria, seventeen in 
Campania, four in Puglia and one in Basilicata. A total of 76 
municipal government have been dissolved to date, while charges 
of complicity with the Mafia has reached deep into public 
institutions, law enforcement and the judiciary. 
  The battle against the Mafia, the DIA report concluded, 
represents a fundamental cornerstone in the overall effort to 
renew the State.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Montedison Official Confirms League </F>
Bribe"] 
  [Text] Milan, 4 Jan (ANSA) -- A top Montedison executive, 
Marcello Portesi, in court testimony on Tuesday [4 January] 
admitted he paid 200 million lire (117,600 dollars) in illegal 
funds to the Northern League for the 1992 election campaign. 
  Testifying at the Milan trial of financier Sergio Cusani in 
connection with kickbacks paid for the failed public-private 
joint venture, Enimont, Portesi said he met several times in 
1991 with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi and party 
treasurer Alessandro Patelli on request from the company. 
  Portesi said Bossi asked for contributions in the form of 
campaign advertising, while Patelli also suggested "financing 
for foreign companies." In the end, Portesi said he delivered 
the 200 million lire in cash to Patelli at a Rome cafe and that 
Patelli did not request the joint receipt required by laws on 
financing of political parties. 
  Patelli was arrested in connection with the funds on 7 
December and Bossi was placed under investigation for the same 
case on December 20. 
  The Northern League, which claims to be innocent of any and 
all political corruption, said the entire affair was a mistake 
by Patelli and has offered to return the money. 
  At his testimony, Portesi also described other contributions 
made by the chemical giant to politicians for the 1992 elections. 
  Today's court session, the twentieth in the trial, was the 
first attended by Cusani himself, who faces charges of 
falsifying accounts and violation of party financing laws. 
  The first person to be brought to trial in the vast Clean 
Hands scandal, Cusani spent five months in Milan's San Vittore 
jail and was granted house arrest on December 23. 
  The financial expert refused to appear in court during his 
jail term, saying he would answer questions only as a free man. 
  Among those due to take the witness stand today were the 
administrative secretaries of the Social Democrats, Liberals and 
Christian Democrats, former Socialist Senator Bruno Pellegrini, 
Socialist MP Paolo Pilliteri, Liberal MP Egidio Sterpa, and 
Vincenzo D'Urso, assistant to the late Socialist Party 
administrative secretary Vincenzo Balsamo. 
  Among those who received unrecorded campaign contributions, 
according to Portesi, were former Socialist Foreign Minister 
Gianni Di Michelis, Milan Mayor Paolo Pillitteri, Maurizio 
Pagani of the Christian Democrat Party and Republican Senator 
Antonio Del Pennino. 
  Portesi said he obtained two billion lire from Montedison 
Chairman Carlo Sama to distribute during the election campaign 
but that he did not spend it all and returned the left-over 
money to Sama.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Public Debt Tops 1,753 Trillion </F>
Lire"] 
  [Text] Rome, 4 Jan (ANSA) -- Italy's public debt reached 
the staggering figure of 1,753.577 trillion lire (1.031 trillion 
dollars) in September, or close to 31 million lire (18,260 
dollars) for every Italian man, woman and child, the Bank of 
Italy reported today. 
  Over the 12 months from September 1992, the debt grew by 178 
trillion lire (104.7 billion dollars), or about 500 billion lire 
(294 million dollars) a day. August was the worst month, with 
debt ballooning by around one trillion lire (588 million 
dollars) a day. 
  In percentage terms, the debt was up 11.3 percent on a year 
previously, almost 25 percent on two years previously, and more 
than 42 percent on six years previously. It is almost double 
what it was six years ago. 
  The total debt in September is split into domestic debt of 
1,671.16 trillion lire, and foreign debts of 82.417 trillion 
lire. 
  The overwhelming bulk of the public sector debt derives from 
market debts (state securities, post-office savings accounts, 
etc.): 1,492.808 trillion lire. 
  The following table shows the growth of the Italian public 
debt over the last 6 years (trillions of lire):

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Banking System Has 65 Trillion Lire </F>
of Bad Debts"] 
  [Text] Rome, 4 Jan (ANSA) -- By the end of September 1993 
the Italian banking system -- including commercial banks and 
special credit institutes, or ICS's -- had accumulated over 65 
trillion lire of bad debts, a 19.5 percent rise on December 
1992, the Bank of Italy reported today. 
  The September figure of 65.426 trillion lire was made up of 
45.059 trillion of bad debts held by commercial banks and 20.367 
trillion held by ICS's. 
  Italian analysts estimate the proportion of these high-risk 
credits destined to become negative balance figures as 35-40 
percent. 
  The following table shows the growth of bad debts over the 
last four years (trillions of lire):

  In other figures released today, the Bank of Italy reported 
that banks had issued 230.634 trillion lire of credit

previous year).

<F P=106> [Report by Greg McIvor: "Swedish Cabinet Divided on Bridge"] </F>
  [Text] Stockholm -- Sweden's rightwing coalition 
government was divided last night on whether to go ahead with a 
controversial proposed bridge link with Denmark. 
  An eagerly-awaited announcement on the future of the 1.8 
billion pound state-backed scheme was unexpectedly postponed 
because of a split that could destroy the four-party coalition. 
  The Centre Party, which opposes the project on environmental 
grounds, has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the 
coalition and bring down the government unless the plans are 
shelved. 
  As several hundred antibridge demonstrators gathered outside 
the Swedish cabinet offices in Stockholm, Olof Johansson, the 
leader of the Centre Party and environment minister, held firm 
to his demand that the project should be dropped. 
  Forced uncharacteristically on to the defensive, the prime 
minister, Carl Bildt, denied that the government was in crisis 
and rejected allegations that he was ready to horse-trade. 
  Mr. Bildt said ministers needed more time to study the 
implications of the "very controversial" bridge. A decision is 
not expected for another week. 
  Mr. Bildt acknowledged the Centre Party's opposition to the 
plans but said Sweden intended to respect an agreement signed 
with Denmark in 1991 to build a combined bridge and tunnel link 
across the Oresund Strait between Malmo and Copenhagen. 
  "It is a principle of this government to respect the 
agreement with Denmark and carry out a tough environmental 
assessment," Mr. Bildt said. 
  Mr. Bildt said the cabinet's views on the project and those 
of Mr. Johansson did not vary widely. 
  "We are close to each other when it comes to the question of 
the Oresund bridge," he said. 
  But the prime minister admitted there was "certain tension." 
He said the cabinet still needed to collect more material on 
public transport and air and water pollution. 
  Should the Centre Party choose to leave the government, the 
coalition would be dissolved and the speaker would appoint a 
prime minister, probably Mr. Bildt, to set up a new government. 
  Bertil Fiskesjo, a Centre Party member, said the party would 
stay in the government as long as certain conditions are met. 
  "Our chances of influencing the continued assessment and 
development of the bridge would decrease if we left," he said. 
  Rigorous environmental evaluations have indicated that it 
will be difficult, if not impossible, to build the bridge 
without disturbing the environment in the strait. 
  The Centre Party, which has strong agrarian roots, believes 
any bridge will damage the environment above and below ground 
and impede salt water currents from the North Sea which 
replenish the Baltic's brackish waters. 
  The salt-water flows are vital to the health of marine life 
in the Baltic. A panel of international marine experts hired 
recently by the Swedish government to investigate the plan's 
implications could give no guarantee that a bridge would not 
block the currents. 
  "It is impossible to give guarantees for a zero solution (no 
environmental impact) on the water flow," a scientist on the 
committee told a Danish newspaper yesterday. 
  Bridge opponents also assert that it will increase traffic 
emissions and make nonsense of Sweden and Denmark's commitment 
at the Earth Summit in Brazil in 1991 to stabilise carbon 
dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. 
  Ecologists believe the construction of a bridge across the 
Oresund Strait will damage the marine environment in an area 
well-known for its seabirds, seals and fish. 
  But Claus Nowotny, of Swedab, the parent company behind the 
bridge consortium, said the plan was being used as an 
environmental whipping post. 
  "It has become a kind of symbol for a concrete, car-oriented 
and large-scale society," he said. 
  The combined bridge and tunnel connecting Copenhagen and 
Malmo would be the first physical link between Sweden and 
Denmark and is seen by both countries as an important emblem of 
their determination to boost trade in the Scandinavian and 
Baltic region. 
  Backers of the project say it would cut transport costs and 
help tie Sweden more firmly to the European continent. After 
two centuries of remaining on the side lines in Europe, Sweden 
has applied to join the European Union. 
  If Sweden pulls out, Denmark has threatened to take legal 
action. The continual wrangling over the project has strained 
diplomatic relations. 
  Construction is scheduled to begin this autumn and work to 
be 
completed by mid-1999. On the Danish side, more than 200 houses 
have already been demolished to make way for entry roads. 
  The Danish government has already spent 100 million pounds 
on 
a motorway connection between Copenhagen and the site of the 
bridge.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu </F>
Ciller by Hugh Pope; place and date not given: "Ciller Makes 
Sure Turkey Knows Who Is the Boss"] 
  [Text] A two-star general sat in the waiting room of the 
Turkish Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller, drumming his fingers on a 
secret red file as he delivered his verdict on the youthful 
university professor who seven months ago became this Muslim 
country's first woman leader. 
  "She's the boss," he said. The judgement on the headstrong 
Mrs Ciller rings increasingly true, even if the Turkish state 
that she rules seems to be growing ever weaker, undermined by 
political gridlock, stark economic contradictions and a Kurdish 
rebel war that on many days kills as many people as die in 
former Yugoslavia. 
  A rare interview with European newspapers shows that 
Turkey's 
leader has come a long way since her election last June to lead 
the conservative True Path Party, the senior partner in the 
coalition government. It is already hard to remember early days 
when she was so unaccustomed to official life that while 
disembarking from official flights she could sometimes be found 
squeezed unceremoniously among a common crush of junior aides. 
  Bureaucrats, advisers and even ministers have been changed 
with bewildering speed to the point where everyone is beholden 
to her. A note of firmness has asserted itself in a voice that 
can wrap up a meeting in a few seconds. Traces creep into her 
speeches of her occasional role model, Baroness Thatcher, as she 
implies a policy is right because she believes it to be right. 
  Unlike Lady Thatcher, however, her only ideology seems to be 
reform. Like her country, she is always in a hurry and often 
late. But like her other role model, the late Turkish President 
Turgut Ozal, she bravely covers up the most gauche of statements 
("We have come a long way, baby, in democracy since the 1940's") 
with her greatest asset -- a brilliant smile in a face that 
seems a decade younger than her declared age of 47. 
  She is no longer a novice in juggling with Turkey's complex 
tangle of priorities, and brushed aside flustered aides as she 
trod on sensitive ground such as Turkey's worries about the 
enlargement of NATO and President Bill Clinton's compromise 
proposals for a Partnership for Peace to be put to next week's 
NATO summit in Brussels. 
  "I feel it's a realistic kind of attitude. I feel that we 
should be looking not for the separation of Europe, but for the 
unification of Europe. The Partnership for Peace proposal is 
even too gradual as far as we are concerned, maybe we should 
move a little faster," she said. 
  Mrs Ciller warned that the West should take seriously a 
potential Russian threat to newly-independent states in the 
Muslim southern belt of the former Soviet Union, whose 
population has ethnic links to Turkey. "Despite what President 
Yeltsin may have in mind, a theme has come to the surface now, 
not exactly going back to the old borders (but) definitely a 
nationalistic attitude. The will is there...to make Russia the 
sole protector of that region," she said. 
  But she stressed that Turkey -- which once kept watch on a 
third of NATO's front with the Warsaw Pact -- wanted to 
co-operate with its northern neighbour and had no ambitions of 
territorial expansion. But she refused to rule out completely 
military intervention to stop Armenia's victories against 
Turkey's ethnic cousins in Azerbaijan. 
  "We always are watching closely...considering and 
reconsidering. As far as Turkey is concerned, we all feel that 
Armenia should withdraw," she said. 
  When the British Prime Minister, John Major, Mr Clinton and 
other NATO leaders gather at the Brussels summit they will meet 
a woman not afraid to make demands, particularly over clamping 
down on the activities in Europe of sympathisers with the 
Marxist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Turkish officials say 
reports of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's death in Syria are 
untrue and hope for Western pressure on Damascus to curb his 
activities, particularly after the banning of the PKK in Germany 
and France. 
  "We have to stand together on all these issues. We should 
not mix up the issue of the PKK with the Kurds living in Turkey 
and elsewhere. About 2,000 people have been killed in Turkey in 
the last year. We are trying to protect our citizens," she said. 
  Mrs Ciller showed no sign of flinching from her backing for 
the security forces' nine-year-old attempts to put down the 
separatist rebellion by force. Any hint of approaching moderate 
Kurds was muted, as was any promise of reforming Turkey's 1982 
constitution under which people are still sent to prison merely 
for speaking their mind on Kurdish and other issues. 
  "Democratisation is something we believe in. We are going to 
take giant steps in that. Not as a concession to the PKK, not 
for that region, but for the whole country," she said. That may 
be her wish, but diplomats say any major reform will only be 
possible in the unlikely event that Mrs Ciller's party receives 
substantial new backing in local elections due in March. 
  Mrs Ciller may get a more sympathetic hearing on the 
question 
of Turkey's relations with the European Union [EU]. She said 
the takeover of the EU presidency by Greece was only a minor 
problem, even though Athens has vetoed any substantial European 
aid to Turkey since 1980. She said she was pleased about a 
recent British-German initiative to establish a new consultative 
mechanism to be set up during a visit to Ankara later this month 
by the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, and his German 
counterpart Klaus Kinkel. 
  "The major point is that the other European countries see 
the 
vitality in Turkey. We are moving very fast (towards customs 
union with Europe). It's costing us a lot. Despite this we are 
committed to doing this step by step. What we are doing must be 
recognised by our friends in Europe. There has been no other 
country that has done this on her own," she said. 
  "Turkey is a bridge to peace, a bridge to the independent 
countries that have separated from Russia, a bridge for Western 
values in the Middle East as well," she added. "When you give 
up Turkey you may end up with a border that has Muslim 
fundamentalism. We need to look not for a separation of 
cultures, but an intermingling."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "NATO Must Forge a New Role"] </F>
  [Text] NATO has lost its old enemy but has failed to find 
a new role since the end of the Cold War. The debate at 
Monday's [8 January] Brussels summit will be dominated by who 
should be allowed to join; but the most important question is 
what the organisation should do. 
  Western governments are likely to adopt the disingenuously 
titled document Partnership for Peace, which offers closer 
co-operation with individual East European states but no 
timetable for NATO membership. 
  The plan is inevitably a compromise. It had to contain 
enough backing for East Europe to satisfy countries nearest to 
NATO's front line, such as Germany. But NATO has had to avoid 
any steps that would make Russia feel more isolated, an emotion 
which extreme nationalists such as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy could 
exploit. The policy has also to acknowledge that the U.S. 
Congress would be reluctant to endorse any extension eastwards 
of the defence umbrella. 
  Even if Partnership for Peace is more a political balancing 
act than the result of detailed strategic analysis, it has got 
the balance right. What NATO needs today is a policy which will 
serve until the political shape of Europe is defined more 
clearly. There are too many uncertainties in the old Soviet 
bloc, particularly in Russia, for NATO to extend to East Europe 
its central guarantee that an attack on one is an attack on all. 
NATO could also be dragged into peripheral disputes, provoked 
by the revival of nationalism, for which the organisation was 
not intended. Equally, the document is the most that could be 
gained while maintaining U.S. involvement in Europe. 
  While Partnership for Peace is the appropriate policy for 
NATO, which is and should remain essentially a defensive 
organisation, it is not, on its own, an adequate defence policy 
for the West. More must be done by Western governments, acting 
outside NATO, to reassure the fledgling democracies of East 
Europe and ensure that communism does not regain ground in the 
former Soviet Union. The fears of Western betrayal, expressed 
so vividly by Polish President Lech Walesa, are understandable 
in a part of Europe that has only just thrown off the yoke of 40 
years of communism. 
  France, itself not a member of NATO's military structure, 
proposes that the European Union offer specific guarantees to 
East Europe. That would provide a clear message to the Russians 
that they should abandon any aspirations to regain control of 
East Europe. 
  But how can Europe offer anything when its foreign policy is 
barely beyond the embryonic stage and there are few signs that 
governments are prepared to surrender national interests to a 
common European one? Would, for example, any guarantee put East 
European countries under French and British nuclear protection? 
Would these states accept joint decisionmaking on the use of 
nuclear weapons? 
  The most effective way to preserve the gains of the past 
four 
years lies in preventing the revival of communism; that can be 
best achieved by helping President Yeltsin develop Russia's 
democracy and market economy. Russian reforms must be 
underpinned by the offer of more technological aid and increased 
investment. West Europe's markets must be opened up rather more 
generously than at present and help given to reviving the 
trading system in East Europe. 
  NATO's role can be reassessed if this policy succeeds. If it 
fails, then NATO can retain its traditional role as guarantor of 
Western security.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Michel Rosten: "NATO: The Cards Are on the </F>
Table"] 
  [Text] Algirdas Brazauskas, former first secretary of the 
Lithuanian Communist Party, has officially presented his 
country's application to join NATO, in his capacity as head of 
state. His approach, made on the eve of the Alliance summit, is 
fairly clumsy in that everybody knows that the Sixteen are not 
really prepared to expand their circle for the time being and 
that the procedure which prevails in their organization makes 
provision for them to invite a partner to sit among them; they 
are therefore not accustomed to welcoming partners on request. 
  However, the initiative taken by Vilnius at least has the 
advantage of making things clear and showing the Allies that 
their idea of a Partnership for Peace does not really 
fundamentally satisfy those to whom it is addressed. And, even 
if it has failed to shake the conviction of those who want to 
keep the Central and East European countries waiting in NATO's 
antechamber for "some time," Mr. Brazauskas' application at 
least shows that not everybody is necessarily deceived. 
  Having said that, Washington is sticking to its positions. 
On Wednesday [5 January], Strobe Talbott, number two in the 
State Department, categorically rejected the application made 
the previous day by Lithuania. Perhaps some may be surprised by 
this hasty procedure (as things stand, decisions are made by 
consensus within the Alliance); but, at least, everybody will 
have registered the idea that "the subject which we have before 
us at present is not the consideration of new members..., but 
the Partnership for Peace." Those who still naively believed 
that the subject of expansion would be included on the summit's 
agenda will therefore be disappointed! 
  At the same time, the Kremlin also complained. In response 
to Vilnius' application, the Kremlin spoke out, once again, 
against an extension of NATO toward the east. Boris Yeltsin 
said he is worried "by the tendency to extend the system of 
blocs." And, while recognizing "an independent country's 
democratic right" to turn to the Brussels headquarters, he said 
that the admission into the Alliance of countries which were 
formerly members of the Communist bloc would jeopardize the end 
of the Cold War and would lead to "political and military 
destabilization." In short, the cards are on the table.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 7 (AFP) -- The West is still holding 
open the option of air strikes to free up relief shipments in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said 
here Friday [7 January]. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation agreed in August to 
launch air attacks on Bosnian Serbs if requested by the United 
Nations to break the siege of Sarajevo and other mainly Moslem 
communities. 
  "The concept to which we agreed in August is still valid," 
Woerner told reporters three days before a NATO summit where 
France plans to make a new push for action on Bosnia amid 
increased shelling of Sarajevo. 
  "I have no doubt that if we would be confronted with a 
request by UNPROFOR (the United Nations Protection Force) or the 
secretary general of the United Nations, NATO would be prepared 
to do what it promised to do," he said. 
  Woerner also predicted the 16-member alliance would be ready 
to help implement any peace accord reached to end the 
21-month-old conflict in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  NATO has drafted plans to send a 50,000-strong force, half 
of 
it from the United States. But doubts have been raised whether 
Washington would contribute its share after its peacekeeping 
problems in Somalia and Haiti. 
  "I think if really the chips are down and the implementation 
of a possible peace plan depends on NATO support, I think there 
is a good chance that the United States will participate," 
Woerner said. "But that is my own guess." 
  Despite pressure by France, he did not think the Bosnian 
conflict would dominate the summit, which will take up such 
issues as ties to the former eastern bloc and strengthening 
NATO's European pillar. 
  "This summit has as the major objective to prepare this 
alliance for the future, to set it on track even for the 21st 
century," Woerner said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix by </F>
Andre Riche; place and date not given: "Delcroix Unwilling To 
Give Up Bosnia"; first four paragraphs are LE SOIR introduction] 
  [Text] It will be a British general -- Michael Rose - who 
will replace Belgium's Francis Briquemont as head of the blue 
helmets deployed in Bosnia. The UN decision was made on 
Wednesday [5 January]. 
  Belgium had put forward candidates to cover the remainder of 
General Briquemont's mandate, but did not insist. The custom is 
that this kind of succession is between officers of different 
nationalities. 
  General Rose is the chief of staff of the British Army. He 
led the special commandos of the British Army during the 
Falklands War. He will face a degree of disquiet within the 
United Nations, voiced again yesterday by General Cot who is 
demanding "a very firm course" in the talks on Bosnia -- it is 
true that just yesterday evening, fierce fighting with heavy 
weapons and automatic weapons broke out in downtown Sarajevo 
and, according to blue helmet calculations, the city was hit by 
a total of 1,353 shells. 
  Firmness? Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix shares this 
view. We questioned him on the reasons for General Briquemont's 
withdrawal. 
  [Delcroix] He is really exhausted, it is a physical reason. 
That was true by mid-December. I understand him. Anybody who 
has visited Bosnia and Sarajevo can see that it is difficult to 
live and sleep there. General Briquemont thinks that you have 
to be in good shape to make good decisions. And he thinks that 
he is no longer in good shape. 
  [Riche] The United Nations did not intervene and request his 
departure? Did the general's very critical statements not have 
an effect? 
  [Delcroix] No, not at all. I have never received any such 
request from the United Nations. If the United Nations had had 
problems, it would have been its place to request his 
withdrawal. I am in favor of more freedom of speech for the 
military. I see nothing very bad in General Briquemont's 
criticisms. He is on the ground, he sees what is happening 
every day: His opinion is of interest to everybody, even if it 
is not always pleasant for politicians or diplomats. 
  [Riche] But will this withdrawal not undermine the morale of 
the 1,000 Belgian soldiers still deployed over there? 
  [Delcroix] There is no direct link. For instance, in 
Baranja, the situation is different and morale is good. But I 
admit that this withdrawal and General Briquemont's frustration 
may spark off a new process, provide an impetus for seeking 
other solutions. 
  [Riche] There is increasing talk of a general withdrawal of 
the blue helmets. How can that be avoided? 
  [Delcroix] I have always said in good time -- from the 
beginning of 1993 -- that some prospect was necessary in this 
military mission. Our soldiers have been there for two years. 
I do not think that we can continue like this for another two 
or three years. Something must change. The April or May 
deadline will be very important. It is now winter and we are 
still giving the negotiations a chance. But if no new prospect 
opens up in two or three months, we will think of other ways. 
  [Riche] Some countries are considering purely and simply 
withdrawing. What would your choice be between a withdrawal or 
more offensive action on the ground? 
  [Delcroix] We cannot all leave this country and give the 
warring sides the opportunity to "solve" their problem in their 
way. That would be very inhuman. It would be a total failure. 
But I think that in two or three months' time, if nothing 
changes, we will have to consider more strictly military 
methods. But that could go hand in hand with a withdrawal of 
ground troops. We will not increase offensive military means 
and at the same time leave our people exposed over there. 
  [Riche] Are you not afraid of shortly being confronted with 
the difficult decision of sending more Belgians to be killed for 
Bosnia? 
  [Delcroix] Yes, that would be a very difficult choice. I 
know that public opinion is demanding that something should be 
done. Even if this impression prevails, it is wrong to think 
that we are not doing anything now. We have saved many lives 
and prevented many misfortunes in Baranja and in Bosnia. 
Moreover, the initial fault does not rest with the Belgian or 
other military, but with the local warring factions. It is also 
for them to find a solution. I sometimes think that people are 
too hard on the military. I am personally in favor of stepping 
up the threat. The warring sides must be told that we will 
react with increased means. That is the only language they 
understand over there.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Michel Rosten: "Decisive Days for Bosnia"] </F>
  [Text] It is possible that within the next two weeks we 
will see the Bosnian crisis take a decisive new turn. At the 
beginning of next week, NATO will be holding a summit during 
which Bosnia will certainly be a subject for discussion. We 
cannot reasonably hope to see, by the waving of a magic wand 
like in a fairy story, any miraculous solution emerge from this 
meeting of the Sixteen. But at least we can hope that the 
allies will agree on a stance to take, and that they 
subsequently stick to it. 
  It is in fact on 18 January that events should start to 
turn. 
This is when the warring parties meet in Geneva to continue 
negotiations. Yet again, there will be comments by those who no 
longer believe that a solution can be found at a table covered 
with green baize; it will be a last-chance meeting for the many 
experts involved in the negotiating process. It does seem clear 
that further failure will have dramatic consequences as it would 
be impossible to implement peace before the spring and that, as 
a result, the war leaders could return to their activities 
undisturbed. 
  This scenario, which would be disastrous for the populations 
of the three communities, is, unfortunately, a serious 
possibility. On Thursday morning [6 January], in an interview 
given to RTBF [French-language Belgian Radio and Television] 
Television from his headquarters in Sarajevo, General Briquemont 
spoke of information indicating that the Bosnian authorities now 
want to win the war. This is not the first time that it has been 
said that Mr. Izetbegovic is not interested in a cease-fire: 
Sufficiently armed, he feels that he is able to adopt a 
position other than that of peacemaker. Diplomats who attended 
the conference organized on 22 December in Brussels by Mr. Claes 
have also concluded -- in all "neutrality" -- that the 
responsibility for the failure of this negotiation lay -- in 
technical terms -- with the Muslims. They demanded, with a view 
to a negotiated division of the republic, 33 percent of the land 
with links between the isolated enclaves. The Serbs, who are 
anxious to achieve a lifting of the international embargo 
imposed on them, were ready to make the concessions that the 
negotiators demanded of them; but Mr. Izetbegovic wanted more or 
-- more specifically -- other zones than those which Mr. 
Karadzic agreed to deliver. 
  This is not a question of coming to the Bosnian Serbs' 
defense, but fairness prevents all the blame for the present 
impasse being attributed to him in the way which Mr. Claes chose 
to do at the end of the negotiations -- and in terms which are 
scarcely in keeping with what one would expect of a foreign 
minister.

<F P=106> [Report by Michael Bond: "The Green Watchdog With No Bite"] </F>
  [Text] It was hailed by enthusiastic environmentalists as a 
sort of "Green police force." Instead, the European Environment 
Agency, based in Green-conscious Denmark, has materialised as a 
toothless watchdog. 
  Copenhagen has finally been designated the Agency's 
permanent 
home after three years of bickering. But it faces an uphill 
struggle, thanks to widespread disillusionment over its role. 
  Its lack of real bite is becoming increasingly embarrassing 
as some individual states seek to reclaim responsibility for 
Green issues from Brussels. That is a dramatic change from the 
idealistic days of 1989, when the idea of the Agency was first 
put forward. Then, environmentalists saw it as a tough 
enforcement agency, knocking into line any state dragging its 
feet on Brussels's environmental rules. 
  At the very least, it was hoped, it would pull together the 
disparate strands of EU environmental legislation and 
co-ordinate policy. 
  Today, with those hopes shattered, it is clear that for the 
first couple of years at least, the Agency will be little more 
than a monitoring centre. It will have virtually no powers to 
police Green laws, and it will play no part in framing European 
environmental policies. 
  According to Phillip Bourdeau, director of the task force 
which has set up the Agency, its main task will be to provide a 
continuous assessment of Europe's environment -- gathering 
statistics on issues like air pollution and the quality of river 
water -- and report to the Brussels environment division and 
European Parliament. 
  Bourdeau says it will be useful in monitoring how effective 
the directives are -- although it will rely on member states to 
provide the necessary statistics. 
  Environmental groups claim that the toothless agency 
reflects 
a growing trend in the European Commission to allow member 
states more flexibility in meeting environmental standards. 
They accuse Brussels of "going soft" on the environment. Many 
in the governments of Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands 
agree. A recent accord on the Commission's packaging directive 
-- which considerably reduces targets on the recycling of 
household waste from those in the original proposal -- was 
strongly opposed by these countries. Hans Alders, the Dutch 
environment minister, claimed the directive had been so weakened 
it had "nothing to do with the environment." 
  Alders had already complained that there was a "malaise in 
environmental policy-making" in the European Union [EU]. He 
said: "Within the last year the Council of Ministers has made 
virtually no important environmental decisions." 
  Ironically, the Maastricht Treaty gave the Union 
considerable 
new powers over the environment, leading many to believe that 
the environment would become one of the Union's most important 
areas for action. 
  Indeed, two weeks after the Maastricht Treaty came into 
force, Yiannis Paleokrassas, EC environment commissioner, said: 
"An enormous amount still remains to be done if we are not to be 
accused by our children and grandchildren of handing down a more 
polluted environment than the one we inherited." Two months 
later, it is clear that the Commission is prepared to sacrifice 
environment for subsidiarity. In the face of considerable 
pressure fron Britain and France, Brussels officials have 
already announced that drinking and bathing water directives are 
to be replaced by framework directives. 
  Both London and Paris have complained that the Commission's 
tough environmental stance was proving politically disastrous 
for governments at home. France's water companies predicted 
that prices would have to double in ten years to meet EU 
standards. 
  The environment is fast becoming Europe's newest political 
battleground. The Dutch government is insisting that the wider 
use of subsidiarity must be accompanied by increased monitoring 
of how member states use their new-found freedom. 
  Giving the European Environment Agency more power would help 
to redress the balance. Victoria Gonzalez of the World Wide 
Fund for Nature in Brussels, said: "We think the Commission is 
unlikely to grant it much power at all. But the agency would 
still make some sort of impact if all it did was provide good, 
detailed information on the environment."

<F P=106> [Report by Ernst Mauritz and Werner Schneider: "Krsko </F>
Nuclear Power Plant: Very Serious Safety Deficiencies"] 
  [Text] "The safety deficiencies we have noted at the 
Slovene nuclear power plant in Krsko are fairly serious. Some 
of our 72 recommendations must be implemented immediately." 
This is how Austrian physicist Wolfgang Kromp summarizes the 
contents of the study by Austrian, Hungarian, Italian, Croatian, 
and Slovene experts, presented in Ljubljana on Wednesday [5 
January] together with two other studies. Krsko is only 80 km 
from the Austrian border. These are some of the experts' most 
urgent recommendations: 

  -  An immediate replacement of the 
brittle steam generators: Radioactive water is channeled through 
them to warm "clean" water for the steam turbines. Many of the 
pipes have cracks. If there is a leak, radioactivity will be 
released. At the same time, problems with draining the heat 
could lead to the reactor overheating. 
  -  Better protection against 
fires, greater powers for the security authorities. 
  -  Precise 
research into the danger of an earthquake in this seismically 
active zone as well as measures to improve the power plant's 
immunity from earthquakes. 
  -  Better protection of the power plant 
from the war in Bosnia. 
  Kromp: "Improving Krsko will cost billions and billions. A 
small country like Slovenia should think about whether it is not 
more economical to close down the plant." 
  However, this is not a topic for Slovene Environment 
Minister 
Miha Jazbinsek. "There will be no early closure." He can 
envisage an increase in the price of electricity to finance the 
measures. 
  Says Styrian nuclear spokesman Candidus Cortolezis: "Austria 
will have to offer financial aid for closing down the plant." A 
similar demand is made by Greens nuclear spokesman Rudi 
Anschober. 
  The Styrian research society "Joanneum Research" has already 
carried out studies on gradual closure and conversion. 
Cortolezis: "However, this alone is not sufficient." If 
nothing is done, the accidents will continue. The latest one, a 
defect in the electronic equipment, occurred on 26 November 
1993. At the moment the fuel elements are being replaced, which 
will take until 12 January.

<F P=106> [Report by Kurt Seinitz: "Zhirinovskiy's Traces in Austria </F>
Lead to Gigantic Treasure of Communist Mafia"] 
  [Text] Bonn/Vienna -- An increasing number of details are 
becoming known concerning the surprise visit by Vladimir 
"Adolfovic" Zhirinovskiy, the Russian election winner, to the 
quiet Lavanttal valley in Carinthia. Zhirinovskiy reportedly 
met a certain Werner Girke, who was responsible for managing the 
enormous foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany 
[SED] in the former German Democratic Republic [GDR]. 
  According to Bonn security circles, Zhirinovskiy wanted to 
"tap" the enormous Stasi funds that were embezzled to Austria 
via cover companies. Zhirinovskiy, who made his career in the 
surroundings of the KGB, is also believed to be the "manager" of 
an underground network of former KGB enterprises abroad, as NEUE 
KRONEN-ZEITUNG reported recently. 
  After the collapse of communism, the security apparatuses of 
the USSR, the GDR, and other states set up their own businesses 
using these huge assets. The profits of the cover companies are 
also being used for political purposes -- Zhirinovskiy's 
assumption of power, for example. Zhirinovskiy had enormous 
sums of money at his disposal during the election campaign, and 
now he even wants to buy a majority of votes in the new 
parliament! 
  The coup with the Berlin "businessman" Girke (nicknamed 
"Account-number Girke"), agreed in Austria, was to be finalized 
in Berlin. This is why the Russian applied for another visa for 
Germany, which, however, he was denied. 
  On the orders of the Trust Agency and the "Commission for 
the 
Search of SED Assets," the Berlin police searched Werner Girke's 
offices yesterday. During the raid, numerous documents were 
seized. Girke is missing. A trustee was installed at his 
company.

<F P=106> [Report signed "M.R.": "Admonishing Words for Asylum </F>
Practice in Austria"] 
  [Text] Even though Austria has one of the highest refugee 
quotas in Europe and private donations are high, legislation for 
refugees is not optimum: Staffan Bodemar, representative of the 
UN High Commissioners for Refugees (UNHCR) in Austria, harshly 
criticized Austria's asylum law yesterday. 
  The law has clear deficiencies that require an amendment. 
The Federal Asylum Office checks the actual reasons for a 
person's flight only cursorily and in a superficial manner. In 
particular regarding the deportation of refugees to so-called 
safe third countries, procedures are not careful enough. Here 
one must check whether it is indeed to be expected that the 
refugee will be safe there. 
  The great latitude in exercising the asylum law is also 
criticized. 
  Interior Minister Loeschnak, on the other hand, presented a 
completely positive balance sheet yesterday: With a recognition 
rate of more than 19 percent of asylum applications, Austria is 
right at the top of the list in Europe. For the Greens, 
Loeschnak's balance sheet is a "cynical game of numbers." 
  The UNHCR is starting a new poster campaign with the slogan: 
"Refugees are Human Beings Just Like You and Me."

  [Text] Ankara, Dec. 6 (AA) -- President Suleyman Demirel 
said today that 1994 will hopefully be a year when aggressors 
will eventually have some common sense. 
  He was addressing the heads of foreign missions in Ankara, 
for whom he hosted a reception on the occasion of the new year. 
  Demirel recalled that after the decease of President Turgut 
Ozal in 1993 he was elected president and meanwhile, leaders of 
leading political parties have also been replaced. [sentence as 
received] 
  Before being elected president, Suleyman Demirel was premier 
and leader of the major coalition partner True Path Party. 
  "All this process took place without hindering the normal 
functioning of the government and the daily lives of citizens, 
within the Constitution and current legislation," he said. 
  Demirel went on to say that Turkey faced great problems in 
the field of foreign policy in 1993. 
  "Instability in the Caucasus and the Balkans and terrorist 
activities aimed from other regions to Turkey, were the main 
issues troubling us. 
  "However, the Turkish governments which were not influenced 
by provocations chose to seek solutions by calling the 
international community to enter multifaceted cooperation. 
  "Turkey has at all times displayed an attitude of compromise 
and moderation," Demirel said. 
  "We hope that 1994 becomes a year which the aggressors 
eventually come to common sense, Armenians withdraw from the 
Azeri land they invaded, the disputes in Georgia are resolved 
and the embargo which creates great grievances for the Iraqi 
people ends and efforts to bring peace to the Middle East 
finally yield a solution," he added. 
  "I am aware that the year 1993 had been a very busy one for 
you diplomats who endeavoured to follow developments in and 
around Turkey. I assure you that the year 1994 will not be 
dissapointing for you," he concluded.

Staff"] 
  [Excerpts] Ankara--The tension Greece has created by its 
wish to further fortify the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea in 
contravention of international agreements has set Turkey into 
action. The General Staff arranged a `war briefing' for 
President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on 
Turkey's new concept of threats yesterday. It has been 
ascertained that President Demirel asked for the surprise 
briefing, which was held in the General Staff Headquarters. 
[passage omitted] 
  It was stressed at the briefing that the possibility of a 
threat from Greece has strengthened, particularly after Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou came to power in that country, and 
that the question of rearming the islands in the Aegean Sea has 
confirmed that state of affairs. It was also stressed that 
two-thirds of the Turkish Armed Forces' fighting personnel have 
been assigned to combat the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] in 
southeastern Turkey, and that this state of affairs has created 
a significant vacuum in the defense of the Aegean and Thrace 
regions. The officials at the briefing explained that shortages 
were mostly observed in the ground forces but not in the Air 
Force units and the Navy. They also explained that the struggle 
against the PKK has used up some military stocks, and that most 
of the resources of the Ground Forces Command have been 
transferred to the General Command of the Gendarmerie Forces to 
be used in the struggle against the PKK. That, they said, has 
created several logistical problems.

  [Text] The Adana Governor's Office has announced that 38 
members of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terror 
organization, one of them a woman, have been captured in Adana. 
The statement notes that the suspects were involved in four 
separate murder cases as well as in armed attacks on police 
stations, police vehicles, and power stations. The suspects 
also supplied logistic support to the organization, recruited 
members, engaged in smuggling in a bid to obtain arms for the 
organization, and extorted money. A Kalashnikov, 28 guns, 209 
rounds of ammunition, propaganda video cassettes, and 
organizational documents were seized in searches conducted in 
the homes and offices of the suspects. 
  Meanwhile, 11 persons reported to have abetted the PKK have 
been captured in the Ercis District of Van. Four more are being 
sought. A rifle, a revolver, many rounds of ammunition, and 
propaganda cassettes were found in searches conducted in the 
homes of the suspects.

<F P=106> [Article by Mia Doornaert: "Belgium, Like the United </F>
States, Reticent About Expansion of NATO"] 
  [Text] Belgium, like the United States, believes that the 
time is not yet ripe to make a decision on broadening NATO 
membership to include the countries of Central Europe. Belgium, 
it is being said in diplomatic circles, is giving priority to 
not supplying ammunition to the ultranationalist opposition to 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Boris Yeltsin himself has 
already expressed his opposition to any eastward expansion of 
NATO. 
  The countries of Central Europe cannot expect much more from 
the declaration to be made by the NATO summit than a general 
statement to the effect that NATO may be extended at a later 
date. That will come as a disappointment to the so-called 
Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and 
Slovakia), which are pressing for a clearer commitment. 
  According to senior Belgian diplomats, NATO must do 
everything within its power to prevent any heightening of 
Russian feelings of inferiority and isolation. To this end, a 
clear decision made now on any expansion of NATO would be 
counterproductive. 
  Like the United States, Belgian diplomats find that "drawing 
new dividing lines" would do nothing to consolidate stability in 
East Europe. 
  According to diplomatic sources, the main problem facing the 
countries in Central and East Europe is not one of military 
insecurity, but one of internal social stability. Awarding them 
NATO membership, they say, would do nothing to change this. 
  The diplomats believe that the "logical and harmonious" road 
ahead for the countries of Central and East Europe consists of 
first gaining membership for the European Union, then also for 
the Western European Union (WEU) and thus for the European 
pillar of NATO. 
  Senior U.S. officials reiterated yesterday that the door to 
NATO would remain closed for the foreseeable future. Strobe 
Talbott, Bill Clinton's special adviser on Russian affairs, 
admitted that U.S. reticence was prompted by the concern not to 
stir up "ultranationalist sentiments in Russia." 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton, who will start off his first 
visit to Europe with a two-day stay in Brussels for the NATO 
summit, will then move on to Prague to convince the Visegrad 
countries of the sympathy and appreciation of the United States 
and NATO. In this connection, Belgian diplomats are saying that 
diplomatic efforts will be required to reassure these countries 
of the fact that NATO is not subjecting them to a "veto" imposed 
by Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article signed FVdH: "Turkey Best Customer of Belgian Arms </F>
Manufacturers -- Kurdish Delegation of Freedom Marchers Requests 
Truce"] 
  [Text] Before leaving Belgium, a delegation of participants 
in the Kurdish freedom march again took the opportunity on 
Wednesday [5 January] of making clear their position at a news 
conference held in the Parliament building, protected by the 
Gendarmerie. The representatives of various minority groups in 
Turkey were the guests of a group of Belgian members of 
parliament of various political parties. 
  Following strong condemnation from the Turkish Government 
and 
in addition to calls for support for the oppressed Kurds, 
satisfaction was expressed at the way in which the Belgian 
Government -- and especially Interior Minister Louis Tobback -- 
had reacted to the clashes between Kurds and Turks last weekend 
in Saint-Josse and Schaerbeek [Brussels]. 
  A spokesman for the marchers called upon the European 
countries -- especially France and Germany -- to stop supplying 
Turkey with arms and to exert international diplomatic pressure 
for a truce between the Kurdish opposition and the Turkish 
Government so that a solution may be sought through political 
and democratic channels to the Kurds' right to 
self-determination. 
  VU [People's Union] Senator Nelly Maes said that, according 
to confidential information that she obtained from Finance 
Minister Philippe Maystadt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are the main 
customers for Belgian manufacturers of light weapons. 
  Her colleague, Willy Kuijpers, asked for the withdrawal of 
the 42 licenses granted by various countries to Turkish arms 
manufacturers and which make it -- after American Lockheed -- 
the world's largest arms producer. 
  Deputy Hugo Van Dienderen of AGALEV [Flemish ecologists] 
would like to know which countries have been supplied with the 
weapons produced by Belgium to the value of 5 billion Belgian 
francs. 
<H5>  Agitator </H5>
  Kuijpers called upon the Turkish Embassy in Belgium to 
remove 
from the streets the man codenamed "Osman," a member of the 
secret service whom he openly charged with being one of the 
agitators involved in the New Year clashes in Saint-Josse. 
Senator Sleeckx of the SP [Flemish Socialist Party] even 
repeated charges of human rights violations observed during last 
year's visit by a parliamentary delegation to southeastern 
Turkey. He expressed his full support for minister Tobback and 
his interpretation of Saturday's events. Senator Hugo Van 
Rompaey of the CVP [Christian People's Party] was of the same 
opinion and also hinted that former Turkish President Turgut 
Ozal may not have met with a natural death due to having showed 
signs of readiness to grant the Kurds a place to live of their 
own. He also stated that he, too, would resort to arms if his 
people were treated as the Kurds are treated. "The PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] people are guerrillas not 
terrorists," he stated, while not advocating violence. He 
stressed the need for a solution to the Kurdish problem through 
dialogue. 
  Dr. Ismet, a lawyer and former senior lecturer at the 
Sorbonne, who has supported the cause of the Kurds for the last 
25 years, pleaded for the Kurds' right to self-determination, 
even within the existing Turkish state system. 
  He wondered whether the federal states in the five countries 
where Kurds now live could not achieve cross-border cooperation 
and referred to Europe where the borders between countries are 
now disappearing and to the federal structure of Belgium and 
Switzerland. 
  He urged those present "not to fall into the trap of Turkish 
propaganda" and said that the PKK members were not terrorists 
but "a well-organized resistance," who were themselves calling 
for an arms truce.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Works on Treaty for </F>
Return of Group of Vietnamese"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The Netherlands Government is hoping to 
sign shortly a treaty with Vietnam on the return of 300 
Vietnamese asylum-seekers. In return for economic support from 
the Netherlands, the Vietnam authorities would guarantee that 
their fellow countrymen were not persecuted following their 
return. 
  Foreign Minister Kooijmans and State Secretary of Justice 
Kosto hope to send the details of the agreement to Parliament 
next week for its assessment. "The talks with the Hanoi 
government are ongoing, but we hope to conclude them," the 
Foreign Ministry said. 
  Two years ago the question of the Vietnamese asylum-seekers, 
who ultimately were refused asylum, led to great commotion when 
the group went on a hunger strike to protest against approaching 
extradition. The group was afraid of persecution in Vietnam, 
because they had traveled from Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands 
without the Vietnamese authorities' permission. 
  According to Inlia, the church group which took care of 
them, 
some 300 of the original group of 350 are still in the 
Netherlands. Most of them have found shelter in low-rent 
accommodations in various villages, Inlia said. The other 50 
have probably traveled to other European countries. 
  Refugee Work [a refugee support group] said that the new 
treaty should offer straight guarantees that nothing would 
happen to the asylum-seekers when they returned to their own 
country. If Vietnam gave that guarantee, the Netherlands 
Government should demand effective local monitoring to ensure 
that the promise was respected. 
  The treaty should also offer a solution for Vietnamese 
asylum-seekers who were sent back against their will, Refugee 
Work said. 
  Germany and Vietnam have already made an agreement on the 
return of asylum-seekers in return for economic support. 
However, in Hanoi, Vietnamese people who return from Germany 
involuntarily have been put back on the plane to Germany. 
  The talks on the Netherlands-Vietnamese treaty, which have 
been dragging on for two years, have been made possible by the 
improved economic and diplomatic relations between the two 
countries. 
  At the end of last year, a trade delegation led by State 
Secretary Van Rooy visited Vietnam. A few weeks ago the 
Netherlands Embassy in Hanoi reopened.

  [Text] Washington DC, Jan 6, CANA -- With democracy 
re-established in Suriname, strong measures should be taken by 
the government to improve the country's economic situation, 
foreign minister of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Dr Peter 
Hendrik Kooijmans, has said. 
  Kooijmans reported his government has an ambitious 
development assistance programme in place for its former colony 
which includes assistance with the rehabilitation of the 
country's infrastructure and strengthening of state institutions. 
  Kooijmans met Wednesday [5 January] with Secretary General 
of 
the Organization of American States (OAS) Baena Soares at OAS 
headquarters in Washington, D.C. 
  "We came to the conclusion that democracy seems to be 
re-established in Suriname but that the economic situation calls 
for strong measures on the part of the government," he said. 
  He reported that his government's economic development 
programme with Suriname was already being implemented "with 
particular emphasis being put on the rehabilitation of 
infrastructure and the strengthening of state institutions such 
as the judiciary and the police." 
  There were problems, he admitted, with the provision of 
balance of payments support to Suriname because there was no 
monitoring of the economy by international institution such as 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
  "The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has to 
make 
sure that the support which we give is effective and we are now 
discussing with the Government of Suriname a way acceptable to 
both of us to ensure that such support is effective," the 
foreign minister remarked. 
  He said he hoped the discussions would result "very soon" in 
the resumption of balance of payments support to Suriname. 
  Turning to the Netherlands Antilles, Dr Kooijmans said he 
briefed the OAS secretary general on recent developments there, 
including the results of a referendum in Curacao where the 
people voted in favour of the maintenance of the Antilles as a 
unit of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 
  "This led to the resignation of the government and so there 
should be new elections in the Netherlands Antilles in 
February," the foreign minister said in an interview. 
  On the situation in Haiti, Dr Kooijmans said what was most 
important "is that democracy be restored."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Christian Democratic Appeal Losing </F>
Popularity Among Voters"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] 
is becoming increasingly unsuccessful in the battle for the 
voters' favor, opinion polls show. The most recent poll by the 
InterView research bureau shows that the Christian Democrats' 
attractiveness under Mr. Brinkman is declining. 
  If parliamentary elections were to be held now, the CDA 
would 
obtain only 38 seats, a loss of 16. Various polls since 
mid-December have suddenly pointed to a significant loss for the 
largest government party. 
  The poll results, which were announced on television 
yesterday evening, also show that the PvdA [Labor Party] is 
still facing heavy losses: 27 seats, compared with 49 in the 
1989 elections. The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66] opposition parties would both 
win 7 and 20 seats respectively, taking them to 29 and 32 places 
in Parliament. 
  The last day of the poll was the day before Christmas. In 
addition, one-third of those asked said that they did not yet 
know which party they would vote for on 3 May.

  [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis proposed 
establishing an arms control system for the Mediterranean. 
Arsenis outlined his proposal during an address at an 
international seminar titled "Armament Limitation and Security 
in the Middle East," which was held in Athens under the auspices 
of the International Relations Institute of Pandion University 
and the Institute of International Conflict and Cooperation of 
the University of California. Arsenis said this arms control 
system could be based on the principle of territorial integrity, 
inviolate borders, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and not 
using force. Greece, he added, is particularly worried about 
the issue of nuclear weapons in Central Asia and the Middle East 
as well as Turkey's interest in these weapons, given that, since 
the breakup of the Soviet Union, the possibilities for nuclear 
proliferation have increased, as have the possibilities for the 
spread of nuclear technology and know-how to unstable regions.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikos Marakis: "Centrists and </F>
Middle-of-the-Roaders"] 
  [Text] The "Centrist camp" had traditionally an almost 
mythical character on the Greek political stage. Until 
recently, it was a subject of contention by the two major 
parties, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] and New 
Democracy [ND], since its conquest led to parliamentary 
majority. Suddenly we now hear people talking about its future, 
and some people even go so far as to discuss its revival as a 
political party. 
  This "revelation" resulted from the explosive reaction of 
[former Foreign Minister] Mikhalis Papaconstandinou, who 
attacked both the PASOK government and the ND leadership for 
their "achievements in Brussels, where they presumably were to 
fight for `Macedonia.'" Papaconstandinou's statements and his 
almost complete indifference to the "penalties" imposed on him 
may have surprised the ND leadership. But some of his friends 
(with whom he usually has lunch at the well-known restaurant at 
Kolonaki Plaza) had a different view. They said "Mikhalis does 
not move haphazardly or for personal reasons. He has a plan." 
  The "plan" they speak of is no other than the formation of a 
"centrist group" within ND which at a later stage (when Andreas 
Papandreou takes over the presidency of the republic) will 
"coordinate" itself with a corresponding group in PASOK to 
revive the "center" in a party form. The more uncertain among 
Papaconstandinou's lunch companions objected that those who see 
such a plan forget that the "quarrel" between [now ND chairman] 
Evert and Papaconstandinou has started since 1964 when 
Papaconstandinou, then deputy minister of defense, punished 
today's leader of New Democracy (who was then serving his 
military stint in the Navy) "for being involved in political 
activities"! They said that their views about the "Center" were 
a scenario of political fiction. But in such cases who can be 
sure that his assessments are correct? 
  In any event, the talk about the "Center" has many 
ramifications since the political personalities who are 
supposedly involved approach this question from different 
viewpoints. All of them, however, share the same theoretical 
scheme. In its more complete and refined form it originates in 
the description of the European political stage where the 
traditional parties have suffered damage beyond repair. It then 
moves to Greece to present the forecast that the departure of A. 
Papandreou will lead PASOK to such "developments" that will 
change into "transitional" the present period in Greece. Out of 
all this, their conclusion is easy: In the future the dominant 
parties will be those with more flexible political views without 
rigid ideological positions. 
  This analysis, or some parts of it, may be incorporated in 
the political thinking of such disparate political figures as A. 
Kaklamanis or A. Andianopoulos, I. Alevras or (Ms.) Dora 
Bakoyianni and others who certainly do not espouse the same 
ideological dogmas nor do they have similar partisan prospects. 
Some speak of 30 parliamentary deputies from PASOK who look 
forward to a centrist [partisan] expression and of a similar 
number of ND deputies. Others limit the number of those who are 
really interested in such a development to only two dozen from 
both major political parties. But beyond those numbers and 
reasoning, the surrounding atmosphere is so strong as to lead 
even members of Evert's inner circle to describe those thoughts 
as "a preparation of the New Democracy for the next period of 
political developments." G. Souflias finds that PASOK is 
abandoning its socialist identity while the New Democracy 
abandons at the same time its more extreme aspects of its 
policies, so that there is a certain convergence of the two 
major parties toward the center and that the area of contest 
between them will not be on ideological "principles" but on 
their ability to manage and deal with the problems more 
effectively. In this context one may understand better the 
inability of ND Deputy Th. Kasimis who could not find 
sufficiently strong arguments to respond to one of his 
colleagues who posed the question: "Is it possible that the two 
major parties have exhausted their historical dynamic?" The 
person who posed the question is not among those who are known 
for their studying and analyzing issues; apparently he reflected 
-- rather unwittingly -- a reasoning already found in 
international political thought. This current of thought claims 
that the parties which today exist in the European countries are 
the product of the bipolarity which prevailed after the war, but 
do not correspond to the conditions which emerged after the fall 
of "communism" and the restructuring of all traditional dogmas. 
  The discussions about the "center" to the extent they turn 
into real political action will find, maybe unexpectedly, a 
rival in the Political Spring party. Its leader, A. Samaras, of 
course prefers to speak of a "middle" not of a "center" area. 
But the section of society that may be defined by the one or the 
other term is the same and includes the vast majority of those 
who are not moved by the "dogmatic ideologies" of the two 
extremes. The notions of "political modernization," and 
"national awakening and restructuring" used by Samaras and 
addressed as they are to the "citizens" as a whole and not to a 
particular social group, constitute his "passport" to the 
"middle of the road." At the same time, his choice is the 
necessary "vehicle" in his effort to develop a "new majority 
current" which will be based on the common, general interests of 
society. He sees the Political Spring as the force which will be 
able to serve most effectively those interests. With this 
strategy he aims at taking away forces from both parties and 
also to push New Democracy to the right to leave him greater 
opportunities for exerting influence. 
  At the same time, Samaras rejects for himself the 
characterization of "politically centrist." In his view, this 
term is connected with the "Center" of the 1960's, which -- he 
claims -- gave to the Greek political history the worst there is 
because it not only failed to undertake the "renewal effort" as 
it had promised but instead it became the standard-bearer of 
"horse trading." Samaras takes seriously the "revolution of 
conscience" he advocates and rejects the tradition of the 
"center" which wanted "the policy to be a succession of a series 
of compromises." Besides, he says, "a policy which does not 
produce specific results is something like a ship without 
destination"... 
  The renewed competition for the "centrist" or the "middle of 
the road" area includes three different currents. One originates 
with those who want to continue the traditions of the old 
center, the second moves around a reasoning of modernization and 
the strategic exploration of confluence between the two major 
parties, and the third is expressed already by the Political 
Spring. Developments move today at a slow pace but progressively 
they acquire a more specific and clear content, something which 
will provide the conditions for a "take-off" as soon as the 
forces in the major political parties become free to move.

<F P=106> [Report by Charlie Kharalambous] </F>
  [Text] National Guard top brass are unhappy about the 
removal of their commander Lieutenant-General Yeoryios 
Siradhakis which they believe is more to do with politics than 
tactics. 
  The new Greek Government has recalled Siradhakis even though 
President Glavkos Kliridhis' request that his term of duty be 
extended was initially granted. 
  But later, Greek Defence Minister Yerasimos Arsenis 
contacted 
Kliridhis and told him it was difficult to extend Siradhakis' 
term of duty here because he had tuned 60 and a re-shuffle of 
the Greek Army leadership was underway. 
  Kliridhis decided not to insist that the Greeks keep their 
promise to allow Siradhakis to stay. 
  It is reported that National Guard officers are unhappy with 
the departure of Siradhakis, who they believe was a good 
commander who improved the army's efficiency. 
  They also see his removal by the Papandreou government as a 
political decision, as the new administration seeks to appoint 
its own supporters within the military. 
  Officers are worried that political differences may now 
reach 
the National Guard in the selection of a new commander. 
  They are also worried about the government's lack of clout 
in 
getting the commander they want, as their demand for Siradhakis 
to stay was turned down. 
  As Siradhakis is expected to leave at the end of the month, 
the procedure for his replacement is now under way. 
  Apart from Greek Vice Marshall Vorvolakos, 
Lieutenant-General 
Khondhros, a strong Papandreou supporter, has also been named as 
a possible contender for the new post. 
  Although National Guard circles are worried about the 
disruption caused to the Army, they also know there is not much 
the government can do. 
  Any show of defiance or protest could seriously damage 
Cyprus' fledgling defence pact with Greece.

<F P=106> [Article by Marie-Claude Lortie: "`A Tax on Illness Is Out </F>
of the Question!'" 
  [Text] The new minister of health pledges that she 
will defend the universality of health care. 
  Ottawa--For Diane Marleau, the new federal minister of 
health, there can be no discussion of it: Public funds may well 
become scarce, but the sacred principle of universal health care 
will not be touched. 
  As long as the Sudbury deputy is at the helm, tickets 
[portion of the cost of treatment paid by the insured] of 
whatever nature will be unacceptable at the Ministry of Health. 
"Whether they be called `ticket orienteur' or `ticket 
moderateur,' in the final analysis the ticket is a tax on 
illness, and I want no part of it," she snaps without the 
slightest hesitation, putting an end to the sentence somewhat 
abruptly, with a slight smile that seems to say: "Next question?" 
  The next question is the most difficult one, namely, the one 
that the provincial and federal governments have faced for many 
years now. It is the question of how to reduce the cost of 
health care while adhering to the principle of universality. 
  This time, the minister's response is more lengthy, less 
clear-cut. She begins by responding: "We must set our priorities 
and do the best we can with the dollars we have." A 50-year-old 
Franco-Ontarian, she comes to the Ministry with the experience 
of one who, with a degree in business administration, has raised 
three children, made a career of municipal politics, headed an 
accounting office, and managed a restaurant, among other things. 
  Explaining that her strategy will consist first and foremost 
of rooting out abuses, the minister continues, "We must address 
the abuses. It is clear that there are abuses. Is charging going 
to eliminate the abuses? I do not think it will.... If diligent 
effort is devoted to eliminating abuses, the means of doing so 
can be found," she says. She speaks of instilling a greater 
sense of "responsibility," of awareness of the costs of health 
care, in the users and the operators of the system. 
  Do you really think that approach would suffice, that it 
would work? 
  "Nothing ventured, nothing gained," replies the minister. 
  Yes, but isn't that likely to be difficult? 
  "It is always difficult, but it is worth the effort.... It 
is 
surprising what can be done with a little cooperation." 
  According to the minister, dialogue and an effort to reach 
agreement are the keys to the solution. In its electoral 
platform, its famous red book, the Liberal Party acknowledged 
the gravity of the problem of financing health care and proposed 
the convoking of a national forum on the issue, to be presided 
by Prime Minister Jean Chretien himself, to bring all the 
operators of the system together in an effort to find agreed 
solutions. Mrs. Marleau says she would like this forum to be 
held this spring. 
<H5>  Freezes? Reductions? </H5>
  For detailed responses on the possibility of a freeze on 
transfer payments to the provinces, for details on ways of 
reducing the costs of services without reducing the list of 
services that are to be provided, for details on the strictness 
with which Ottawa intends to enforce the health-care law, we 
shall have to take a rain check. Mrs. Marleau has not even 
decided yet how she is going to respond to Quebecois Minister 
Marc-Yvan Cote's proposal to bill patients for certain home care 
services. She is awaiting a proposal in writing. 
  It may be that the response to these questions will rather 
come from the minister of finance, who, since the restructuring 
of the government, is responsible for everything concerning 
transfer payments to the provinces. Or perhaps it will come from 
Minister Marcel Masse, who is responsible for federal-provincial 
relations and who recently stated that spending on health care 
must be reduced by 20 percent, although he later retracted this 
statement. 
  In short, Mrs. Marleau will not be the only one to concern 
herself with this thorny problem of health-care costs, but, as 
the minister responsible for enforcing the Canadian law on 
health care, it is nevertheless she who will have to shoulder 
the task of steering the profound and painful restructurings 
looming on the horizon. 
  Gaston Levac, general director of Sudbury's Laurentian 
Hospital, who knew Mrs. Marleau when she was a member of the 
institution's board of directors, believes she has the 
"knowledge and the ability" needed to find solutions. 
  "But that alone is not necessarily sufficient. I wonder 
whether Mrs. Marleau will have the necessary force of character 
to make the tough decisions that will have to be made and to 
deal with the opposition that is going to develop. Because the 
social changes being talked about are going to be very difficult 
to implement." 
<H5>  A Poor Childhood </H5>
  A native of Kirkland Lake, Diane Marleau has spent most of 
her life in Sudbury, in what is known as northern Ontario but 
what is really the north of inhabited Ontario. 
  She comes from a single-parent family of three children, her 
father having deserted the family household when she was very 
young. Mrs. Marleau does not remember her father. Her mother, 
who was a schoolteacher, had to work hard and long hours to make 
ends meet. "I grew up in poverty, considerable poverty. At that 
time, it was not easy for a woman left alone with three 
children. They were not paid the same wages as men. It was 
barely half as much, I believe," says the minister. 
  When asked if it is these difficult experiences that have 
made her a feminist, Mrs. Marleau bridles. She evidently does 
not like the term "feminist." "I don't like to be categorized. 
Actually, I am a very traditional woman. I have been married to 
the same man for 30 years," she snaps. 
  Her friend and adviser, Vince di Norcia, a professor of 
philosophy and former Neo-Democrat, however, thinks she is 
precisely "a true feminist, those women who take their place 
through action." 
  Diane Marleau was elected for the first time on the federal 
scene in 1988, but her political career goes back to 1980 when 
she was elected to Sudbury's municipal council. And her very 
first experience in politics goes back to the election of Judy 
Erola--former Liberal minister--in the Nickel Belt county, in 
that same year. 
  Mrs. Erola had asked Mrs. Marleau's husband, Paul Marleau, 
an 
accountant--today, "semi-retired"--to be her official agent. Mr. 
Marleau replied in the affirmative, adding that, in any case, 
Diane would be doing the work. Anita Thompson, a former 
journalist and long-time friend of Mrs. Marleau's family, 
recounts that Judy Erola lost no time in telling him that, if 
that was the case, she was quite capable of asking Diane 
directly to be her official agent. 
<H5>  The City Without Debt </H5>
  A few months later, Mrs. Marleau made her own entry into the 
world of politics, on the municipal scene, after three years 
spent at home caring for her youngest child, Stephane, who is 
now 16 and lives in Sudbury with her father. 
  The minister says the idea was suggested to her by the 
municipal councillor of her district, who had decided to retire. 
Mrs. Marleau met him in the street and told him that she was not 
particularly impressed by the names of his would-be successors 
at the time. 
  "At that point," she recalls, "he said to me: `Then, why 
don't you run for the job?'" 
  Mrs. Marleau was elected to the municipal council, then 
appointed to Sudbury's regional council. 
  "I helped her write her first speech to the business 
community. Since then, she calls me her mentor. It is a very 
nice compliment," says Mrs. Thompson. "Diane was very tense, 
very nervous, at the time. But she learned. She is by no means 
like that today." 
  In 1985, Mrs. Marleau ran for mayor against Peter Wong and 
lost. This fact is not found in the official biography provided 
by the party. Nor does she herself care to talk about it. 
  Regarding her years in municipal politics, everyone 
remembers 
mainly one thing: Mrs. Marleau was one of the principal 
advocates of an austere antideficit policy that finally enabled 
the city to pay off all its debts. "She was truly one of the 
most committed throughout that debate," recalls Peter Wong, who 
holds this "hard worker," his one-time rival, in very high 
esteem. 
<H5>  Is Mother Going to Ottawa? </H5>
  After her defeat for mayor, Mrs. Marleau became an 
administrator at Collins, Barrow-Maheu, Noiseux, a Sudbury 
accounting office. In 1988, the Liberal Party pressed her to run 
as a candidate for office in Sudbury County, a county that has 
always been Liberal, except for a brief period around the end of 
the 1960's when the Neo-Democrats won a by-election. 
  Mrs. Marleau says laughingly that she was caught at her own 
game. She had often complained about the fact that the party 
never gave counties that are sure bets to women. When they 
offered her the candidacy, they went out of their way to remind 
her of this. So, she decided to run and won in the autumn of 
1988. She does not in the least regret having made that 
decision, but says that it was very painful to her to have to 
leave her family behind in Sudbury, especially her "baby." 
Today, Mrs. Marleau still lives in Sudbury, and she returns 
every weekend. She spends the rest of the week in Ottawa with 
her oldest daughter, Brigitte. 
  In the opposition she has played many roles, including that 
of substitute critic for Mines and for Government Operations. 
She was also a member, and subsequently vice chairman, of the 
Standing Committee for Finance, president of the Ontario Caucus, 
deputy whip, etc. 
  In November, Jean Chretien appointed a loyal deputy, but a 
member of the party's scratch team, as his administration's 
minister of health. A woman "who, being in the opposition, has 
not had occasion to make political enemies," says Mr. Levac, but 
who now finds herself having to deal with 10 provinces, a 
universal health-care system that is in deep financial crisis 
and one of the Liberal Administration's most difficult 
ministries to pilot.

<F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vuoristo: "The Last Leninist"] </F>
  [Text] When, at the beginning of the 1970's, Pekka 
Tiainen's generation matriculated in the universities, the 
revolution was already well under way. 
  The ground-breaking work had already been done, and one was 
considered a progressive if one accepted the results. The 
supporters of Taisto Sinisalo (the Stalinists) took care of the 
movement's details, as they had seized the initiative in the 
civil war raging within the Communist Party. The struggle over 
administrative control of the universities yielded a feel for 
the practical side of the revolution. 
  Many a middle-class youth briefly thrust himself into the 
front lines of the revolution, became frustrated and withdrew, 
and today reminisces over these days, either with humor or 
wistful longing. But not Pekka Tiainen. His story was 
different, because he was more diligent than the others. 
  Vietnam and Das Kapital 
  Pekka Tiainen's father was the head of Savonlinna's 
Telephone 
Company and represented the Conservative Party as a city 
councilman, and his mother was a registered nurse. The 
atmosphere in their home was described as open and liberal. 
  As a young man, Tiainen was interested in chess, athletics, 
and hiking. There were some Social Democratic and Conservative 
youth groups in the school, but the other students laughed at 
them behind their backs. 
  Matters took a different turn in 1965, when the United 
States 
started to bomb North Vietnam. U.S. imperialism was soon 
condemned at the Savonlinna Upper Secondary School. At the same 
time, communism, which previously had been taboo, became a 
subject of interest. 
  The goings-on evoked an interest within Tiainen to know 
more. 
Before matriculating at the University of Helsinki, he had waded 
through Allardt's book, Sociology, and he had also 
familiarized himself with Marx's Das Kapital, which 
was a book that many a good Marxist never had the energy to 
peruse. 
  During the summers, Tiainen had also traveled in Europe. The 
nights spent on the dirt floor of the subway construction site 
in Munich, in the company of foreign workers, introduced him to 
the life of the proletariat. 
<H5>  Ideology and Practice </H5>
  At the university, Tiainen realized that his opinions 
coincided with the views of the communists on various matters. 
Almost immediately, he joined the Academic Socialist Association. 
  In connection with the support collections during the strike 
winter of 1971, Tiainen saw how the intelligentsia could join 
forces with the working class at the front lines of the 
struggle, and in the summer of that year, he joined the 
Viisikulma Section of the Communist Party. The student communes 
in that part of the city ensured a Stalinist majority in the 
section. 
  Of the Stalinist students, some focused on the revolution, 
others on changing scientific research according to Marxist 
dogma, while some others concentrated on their studies. Tiainen 
had all three impulses. He was both a diligent study group 
member and an energetic party activist, as well as a 
conscientious student. 
  Tiainen did not become a front-line scientist, but neither 
did he become a Stalinist dogmatic, nor a political organization 
leader. Instead of taking part in the struggle between political 
factions, he was interested in the economy, and such a man is of 
limited use in a war. 
  Tiainen's best period as a member of the Communist Party 
came 
about 20 years ago, when, based on demands voiced by the 
Communist Party in the USSR, an attempt was made to join the 
warring factions together. While preparing economic and 
employment policy analyses for the party, Tiainen tried to find 
issues that the factions agreed on and avoided controversial 
subjects. Everybody acknowledged Tiainen's contributions. 
<H5>  Major and Minor Issues </H5>
  As a member of the feisty Communist Workers' Party, Tiainen 
is now one of the last real Leninists. He is not driven by an 
unquenchable revolutionary zeal. When asked, he certainly 
supports the revolution, but he prefers to talk about his 
bailiwick, the economy, and avoids Marxist argot. 
  The election campaign is conducted under the auspices of the 
Potemkin village organization, "The Popular Front Against the 
EC." During the campaign, Tiainen's speeches have been lacking 
in vision, as his vision is socialism, a subject he prefers to 
avoid. 
  Tiainen's membership in the last group of Leninists is due 
to 
his perseverance and serious nature. These are his basic 
character traits. After deciding to become a Leninist, he never 
changed his mind, even after nations crumbled, but would rather 
be the last Leninist. It is unavoidable for such a person to end 
up in the minority within the minority, especially when he 
always ends up defending the right of each minority to remain 
with the organization. 
  One is hard-pressed to consider Tiainen's political career 
as 
an indication of any particular talent as a statesman. On the 
other hand, Tiainen has finally been able to achieve a role of 
political leadership within the Communist Workers' Party. In 
other organizations, the comrades soon realized that, in his 
vision, he, in spite of his perseverance and seriousness, has 
difficulties in separating major and minor issues from each 
other. 
  This third basic character trait was well known by the 
Vantaa 
Municipal Council, where it is told that the meeting hall became 
empty each time Tiainen stepped to the rostrum. This can also be 
gleaned from his curriculum vitae, distributed for the 
presidential campaign, which, in its 13 pages, contains 
everything, including data processing extension courses. 
  Tiainen's characteristics have been useful in his research 
work. His analyses have been met with uniform praise, as they do 
not omit a single point of view. But if one attempts to see the 
larger picture, it is deleterious even for a researcher to get 
bogged down in details. Tiainen's doctoral thesis is living 
proof of that, as it promises to be scientifically meritorious, 
as soon as the professors are able dig out the hidden gems. 
<H5>  Pekka Tiainen </H5>
  Pekka Tapio Tiainen was born in Helsinki on 3 August 1951. 
In 
1956, the family moved to Savonlinna. 
  Tiainen graduated from Savonlinna Upper Secondary School in 
1970. He received his Licentiate in Political Science from the 
University of Helsinki in 1983, majoring in economics. He is in 
the process of completing his doctoral thesis regarding the 
factors of economic growth in Finland in the 20th century. 
  Tiainen's professional career has been as a special 
researcher at the Ministry of Labor, to which position he was 
appointed in 1982. Before that, he conducted research at, among 
other places, the Environmental Protection Department of the 
Interior Ministry and the bank Kansallispankki. He is considered 
one of the country's foremost experts on employment issues, and 
the list of studies prepared by him is impressive. 
  Tiainen was a member of the Finnish Communist Party during 
the period 1971-88, and since then he has been a member of the 
Communist Workers' Party. While a member of the Finnish 
Communist Party, he held various positions on a local and 
district level, and within the minority faction of the Communist 
Party, he was subsequently a substitute member of the Central 
Committee and a member of the Economic Policy Section. He 
currently serves as vice chairman of the Communist Workers' 
Party. 
  Tiainen was a member of the Vantaa Municipal Council during 
the period of 1984-92, first as a representative of the Finnish 
People's Democratic League (SKDL) and later representing 
Democratic Alternative (DEVA). 
  Tiainen's military rank is lieutenant. He separated from the 
church in 1969. 
  Tiainen has been married since 1976. His wife Ritva is 
employed as a social worker in an institution. They have a 
15-year-old son and a 11-year-old daughter. The family lives in 
Lansimaki in Vantaa. 
  Tiainen's hobbies are chess and running--he runs a few 
thousand kilometers a year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Childhood Diseases of Direct </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] Eleven candidates finally succeeded in capturing 
slots in the first direct presidential elections. Based on the 
game rules currently in effect, the number could easily have 
been even larger. This makes one think of tightening the rules. 
It is very simple to fulfill the requirement of needing the 
signatures of 20,000 supporters, if they can be collected in the 
same manner as one fills out a lotto ticket at a service 
station. Signing for someone else or for an imaginary person 
constitutes fraud and deception of the authorities. A person who 
engages in such behavior, or the candidate's election 
representative, could be brought up on criminal charges. 
  The right of popular movements to appoint candidates should 
not, in itself, be made too difficult in connection with direct 
popular elections. If we end up having as many candidates as we 
have now, the notion of giving all candidates equal treatment in 
the media becomes absurd. The media, including the Finnish 
Broadcasting Company, must, to a greater extent, rely on their 
journalistic judgment. Otherwise, we would end up in a situation 
where the media publicity resulting from the status as a 
presidential candidate could be used as a front for various 
ulterior motives. 
  Some obvious weaknesses have become evident in the parties' 
preliminary election procedures. Remedying these shortcomings 
should mainly be up to the political parties. In particular, the 
experiences that all the parties involved have had with the open 
preliminaries should give us food for thought. The appointment 
of a candidate for the Social Democratic Party moved away from 
the party to outsiders. The Center Party's preliminary 
elections, in Helsinki and suburbs, attracted a large number of 
people from other areas who only wanted to protest against the 
appointment of the party's sure candidate. 
  In its current form, the presidential election campaign, 
including preliminary elections and party summer congresses, 
will last almost a year. As the preliminary elections have come 
to stay, the role of the party congresses in appointing 
candidates becomes insignificant and a formality. The 
preliminary elections and the naming of candidates could easily 
be moved to early fall, which would mean that the election 
campaign could be shortened to only a few months. If some 
parties want the party congress to give a candidacy its 
imprimatur, they could arrange for an extraordinary party 
congress once every six years.

<F P=106> [Article by Trade Minister Bjorn Tore Godal: "Norway and the </F>
EU Agreed on High Environmental Standards"] 
  [Text] In the negotiations for Norwegian membership of the 
EU [European Union], one of Norway's main objectives has been to 
uphold our standards in the fields of health, safety, and the 
environment. At the 21 December ministerial meeting between 
Norway and the EU in Brussels, agreement was reached that Norway 
may maintain the level of its standards on health, safety, and 
the environment in those areas where Norway has stricter rules 
than the EU. 
  Health, safety, and environmental issues are of importance 
for many different areas of society. I want to stress that the 
technical review prior to the negotiations showed there were 
very few cases of differences between Norwegian regulations and 
EU regulations, and a very limited number of areas in which it 
took time to find satisfactory solutions. In addition, these 
are often technically difficult areas where people should 
ideally have a good prior knowledge to be able to evaluate the 
results. 
  The negotiations have not covered standards for emissions 
from industrial installations, the purification of waste by 
local authorities, health and safety in the workplace, and so 
on. Here the EU has minimum standards, but member nations are 
free to introduce their own stricter standards. 
  There can be no doubt that the EU is on the right road when 
it comes to health, safety, and the environment, even though 
things move a little sluggishly at times. The chances that 
within the course of a few years the EU will come up to our 
standards in those areas where it is currently lagging behind 
are great. Nor should we forget that in a few fields the EU is 
actually ahead of us. For example, the EEA [European Economic 
Area] agreement means that we have to tighten up our standards 
or introduce new regulations covering the sulfur content of oil 
and rules covering major industrial accidents and emergencies. 
  Norway has been given confirmation that Norwegian rules 
covering asbestos and some other hazardous materials do not 
conflict with the EU's regulations, and that we may as a result 
retain Norwegian regulations. This also applies to the labeling 
of organic solvents, safety information documentation for 
chemical substances and preparations, concentration limits for 
hazardous preparations -- 5 percent in Norway as against 25 
percent in the EU -- PVB [polyvinyl butyral] and PCT (hazardous 
chemicals). 
  The most difficult areas in the negotiations have been areas 
relating to chemicals where the difference between EU and 
Norwegian legislation is greatest because of different 
approaches. The differences have chiefly been linked to: 
  -- the system of classifying and labeling carcinogenic 
substances, 
  -- the system of classifying and labeling allergenic 
substances, 
  -- methods of testing the amounts of allergenic substances 
contained in preparations, and 
  -- Norwegian regulations covering the heavy metal content of 
batteries. 
  In the negotiations Norway won a transitional period of four 
years. In this transitional period, there will be comprehensive 
cooperation with the aim of arriving at satisfactory solutions. 
The objective is to arrive at common EU rules which satisfy 
Norway's demands. Environmental issues are high on the EU's 
agenda. As a consequence of Swedish, Finnish, Austrian, and 
Norwegian membership, environmental issues will be given an even 
higher priority. 
  If the EU has not come up to Norwegian standards in the 
transitional period, Norway is expecting that the transitional 
period can be extended. Norway is involved in determining the 
premises for the work in the transitional period. Work will be 
continuous throughout the period. If the work is not completed 
by the end of the transitional period, it would therefore be 
natural to extend the transitional period until a satisfactory 
result has been achieved. 
  If it proves impossible to achieve a satisfactory result, 
the 
EU's regulations allow member countries to uphold their high 
standards as long as real health, safety, and environmental 
considerations form the basis for upholding and further 
developing these standards. 
  However, the condition is that there can be no suggestion 
that health, safety, and environmental considerations are being 
used as as a smokescreen for a country's desire to protect its 
own industry. Norwegian demands in this field are based on 
specialist and scientific evaluations and are therefore clearly 
justified for health, safety, and environmental reasons. 
  I am wholly confident that on this foundation Norway will be 
able to uphold its regulations in the health, safety, and 
environmental fields even after membership of the EU.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: "Fear of Nuclear Transit Through </F>
Norway"] 
  [Text] "It seems a likely possibility that stolen nuclear 
materials is being transported through Norway." 
  This is said by Erling Stranden, who is the director of the 
Department for Preparedness and Security at the National 
Radiation Protection Board. Stranden says that it is not 
inconceivable that the thieves who stole three fuel rods from 
military storage in Murmansk either have smuggled the stolen 
goods out through Finnmark or that they will try to do so. 
"Norway could definitely be part of a smuggling route," he says. 
  Thomas Nilsen from Bellona, having worked with nuclear 
threats in the north for many years, agrees: "Inspection at the 
border crossing at Storskog should be considerably improved. I 
have crossed the border about 40 times since 1988. My luggage 
has never been inspected, either on the Norwegian or on the 
Russian side. According to our sources it has been possible for 
a long time to buy different types of radioactive materials on 
the streets of Murmansk. Almost anything can be obtained at Kola 
as long as one has dollars. As customers for these kinds of 
materials are found in other countries, it is probable that 
Norway will be part of a smuggling route," Nilsen says. 
<H5>  Easy To Smuggle </H5>
  Last night it became clear that the three fuel rods are 1 
meter long and are 5-6 cm. in diameter. They are unused, and 
were to be used in the reactor of one of the many nuclear 
submarines at Kola. It is thought to be a simple affair to 
transport three such metal pipes without being discovered. 
  As the rods are unused, radiation is minimal. They are 
therefore relatively harmless to the thieves, as well as 
unsuitable as a terrorist weapon. Used rods could have been 
dumped in drinking water sources and so on, and poisonous 
plutonium, strontium, and cesium would have caused enormous 
damage. But as these three rods are unused, they are relatively 
harmless. They contain mainly highly enriched uranium. Even with 
a geiger counter, the rods would be hard to detect. 
  Departmental Director Stranden at the National Radiation 
Protection Board says it would hardly be noticeable on the 
geiger counter if measured from the outside of a car that had 
the rods in the trunk. "However, had a customs inspector found 
the three suspect metal tubes and measured them directly, the 
radiation would have been noticeable," Stranden says. 
  Consul General Knut Hauge in Murmansk thinks there is no 
immediate reason to fear that Norway will become a transit 
country for stolen Russian nuclear equipment: "We must of course 
be prepared, but the control at the Norwegian-Russian border is, 
in my opinion, so good that this route is probably not the most 
attractive one out of Russia," Hauge says. 
<H5>  Good for Bombs </H5>
  As the three fuel rods were to be used in nuclear 
submarines, 
the uranium in the rods is probably highly enriched--up to 90 
percent. That makes the uranium suitable for bomb production. To 
make even a small nuclear bomb, however, 5 to 10 kilos of 
uranium is needed. The three short rods are not big enough to 
contain that much. Russian authorities have not disclosed how 
much uranium the rods contained. 
  Sources within nuclear circles in Murmansk yesterday 
afternoon informed the Norwegian consulate general in that city 
that since the rods are unused, it is unthinkable that they can 
be used for terrorist purposes. However, the uranium can be 
extracted from the rods and be used, for instance to produce 
bombs, according to Russian sources. 
  Stranden agrees: "Even though there is not enough uranium in 
these rods to make a bomb, it could be a first step for 
countries wanting to develop nuclear arms. We know there are 
nations having the technology and knowledge to make bombs, but 
which lack highly enriched materials," Stranden says to 
AFTENPOSTEN. 
<H5>  Planned Theft </H5>
  The theft was discovered in the middle of the day on 27 
November in connection with a routine control. Police in 
Murmansk so far do not know anything further as to when the rods 
were stolen, but have asked for help from the public. The rods 
were stolen from a storage facility at the military Rosta 
shipyard in the northern Lenin area of Murmansk. 
  According to Hauge, the Murmansk police take it as a given 
that this was a theft to order. "The thieves obviously knew what 
they were looking for, and according to the police, they were 
familiar with the shipyard," he says. The fact that the police 
are asking for help in a military theft is regarded as 
sensational. 
  Spokesmen for the National Radiation Protection Board in 
Norway, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others 
reiterated yesterday how frightening it is that such a theft can 
happen. "But we had to take into account that such things might 
happen in today's Russia," says spokesman for the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Ingvard Havnen. 
  When the Soviet Union collapsed, much of government control 
disappeared. At the same time much of the control of Russia's 
many nuclear installations disappeared. 
  As late as two to three weeks ago, Turkish police discovered 
a couple of kilos of Russian uranium. And just over a week ago, 
fuel rods were stolen from the Ignalina power plant in Lithuania. 
  Nilsen thinks that the danger of radioactive materials 
falling into the hands of terrorists or others with no 
legitimate reason to possess them pose a greater security risk 
in the north than the nuclear reactors themselves. He refers to 
many episodes on the Kola peninsula as proof that security 
measures are terrible. 
  In 1992 KGB agents carried out an arranged "attack" against 
the nuclear icebreaker Sibir at the Murmansk docks. The agents 
were able to get as far as to the reactor section before they 
were discovered. The KGB did this to show how poor nuclear 
security in the country has become. In the same year a Russian 
television journalist was able to smuggle 200 grams of cesium 
out of Atomflot, the icebreaker base in Murmansk. This comes in 
addition to small fires in nuclear submarines and near accidents 
at the nuclear power plant in Kola. Nilsen also refers to the 
two occasions when he visited this nuclear power plant: "Both 
times we were shown around deep down in the reactor areas and in 
the important control rooms without anyone checking our luggage." 
<H5>  No Fuss in Murmansk </H5>
  The nuclear theft has not frightened the city's inhabitants. 
  Yesterday morning the city's people could read an 
announcement in the local paper that three fuel rods had been 
discovered stolen from a storage area in town last Saturday. It 
further announced that an investigating committee had been 
formed consisting of 18 people, from the military prosecuting 
authorities, from the counter espionage groups, and from the 
police respectively. A special telephone number for tips to the 
police was established for this purpose. 
  Hauge in Murmansk says that nobody in the city is concerned 
about such matters as long as there is no danger of an increase 
in radiation in the near vicinity. "It was not even mentioned in 
the local news this evening. I have tried all day to call the 
police using the published hotline number, but nobody answered," 
Hauge said last night.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Swedish European Affairs Minister </F>
Ulf Dinkelspiel by Inger Jagerhorn; date, place not given] 
  [Text] An extraordinary summit between Sweden and the 
heads of government of the EU [European Union] countries could 
be held to resolve the final tricky issues in Sweden's 
negotiations for membership of the Union. At this hard 
bargaining session, contributions to Swedish farmers could be 
played off against the size of Sweden's membership fee. 
  European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel is bearing this in 
mind as a possibility, and a meeting has been preliminarily 
penciled in by EU president Greece for late February/early March. 
  Ulf Dinkelspiel is preparing himself for the final spurt in 
the negotiations. At the same time he is very aware of the 
opposition to the EU in public opinion. 
  The notorious EU optimist admits that the "yes" side's 
uncritical praise for membership could have reduced its 
credibility. He even went so far as to mention certain 
disadvantages. 
  Ulf Dinkelspiel, star negotiator under the Social Democratic 
government and today a Moderate Coalition Party minister, said 
that much could happen in the very last phase of the 
negotiations. A possibility that he does not rule out is that 
the size of the Swedish contribution to the EU budget could be 
played off against the contributions which Swedish farmers will 
receive from the EU. 
  Sweden's membership contribution to the EU has been 
estimated 
at 22-24 billion kronor per year. This gigantic sum will be a 
further strain on Sweden's already overstretched state coffers. 
The Swedish negotiators are trying on the one hand to persuade 
the EU to change the basis for calculating Sweden's membership 
contribution, and on the other to win agreement for phasing-in 
during a transitional period. 
  But so far this has fallen on deaf ears in the EU. One 
compromise could be found instead in smaller subsidies for 
Swedish farmers from the EU's agriculture budget. 
  In an interview with DAGENS NYHETER on the eve of the final 
spurt of the negotiations, Ulf Dinkelspiel said that for the 
time being at least each issue is being negotiated on "its own 
merits." But he spoke more about the importance of regional 
support than about the importance of agriculture. Sweden wants 
to continue to pursue its own regional policy, and it also wants 
support from the EU's structural fund. 
  Very different and much smaller sums are involved here than 
in the case of agriculture. 
  When Swedish influence in terms of the number of votes 
Sweden 
has in the EU's decisionmaking body, the Council of Ministers, 
is to be determined, a similar give-and-take situation could 
arise. 
  The EU has offered Sweden four votes, while Portugal with 
just over a million more inhabitants than Sweden has five. The 
Netherlands with 15 million inhabitants also has five votes. 
Asked whether Sweden could be forced to "buy" the fifth vote 
through lower agricultural subsidies or higher membership 
contributions, Dinkelspiel replied: 
  "We, like our opposite number, must be prepared to give and 
take in the final phase of negotiations." 
  Exhausted but happy, the Swedish negotiators traveled home 
in 
the days before Christmas. The long awaited "ketchup effect" (a 
lot at once after several unsuccessful attempts) had 
materialized. 
  Ulf Dinkelspiel exudes satsisfaction. He thinks that there 
is a platform to be happy about. The EEA [European Economic 
Area] agreement is in place, the GATT negotiations have been 
sorted out, and in the EU negotiations the environmental issues 
are among those that have been settled. 
  Dinkelspiel's assessment of the EEA agreement, which creates 
a region of European economic cooperation embracing 18 
countries, is that in material terms it is better than expected, 
but in institutional terms is worse: 
  "For me it is incomprehensible that the `no' side is so 
strongly critical of the EEA agreement because of its 
institutional solutions (Swedish influence) and then opposes EU 
membership." 
  He pointed out that the EEA agreement also embraces Sweden's 
state alcohol monopoly and transport subsidies that are so 
important for Norrland and the forestry industry. 
  "Regardless of what happens we are bound by the EEA 
agreement. The membership negotiations do not really change 
anything on these points. They are therefore of minor interest." 
  The uproar in Rostanga [village near Malmo] involving the 
Ica 
[Swedish grocery chain] storekeeper who challenged the state 
alcohol monopoly on New Year's Day made many Swedes ask: Just 
who is it who actually decides? 
  "In the EU it is the governments of all the countries which 
decide jointly," the European affairs minister said. "But if 
there are problems of interpretation, as in the present case, it 
is the EU court which decides in the final instance." 
  Nor does the question of summer cottages worry him. On the 
subject of the sale of Swedish leisure homes to EU citizens he 
said: 
  "I do not think that this is a major issue either for the 
country as a whole or for the electorate." 
  If the timetable is to hold, the negotiations must be 
completed in seven or eight weeks' time. Sweden will not wait 
for slower countries, the European affairs minister stressed: 
  "It would run contrary to Swedish interests to make our 
negotiations dependent on those of other countries." 
  Norway and Finland are demanding transitional arrangements 
in 
the field of agriculture which would mean continued border 
controls. Dinkelspiel affirmed that it is Sweden's goal to 
abolish them in January 1995. Temporary border controls could 
be introduced in the Nordic area. 
  Once the negotiations have been completed Dinkelspiel's 
people will take two or three weeks to draft a departmental 
memorandum on the results. It will go to the Riksdag and then 
be sent out for comment for three months. Proposed legislation 
on membership would not come before the summer, the European 
affairs minister said. 
  But a referendum could very well take place before then, he 
pointed out. A popular version of the result of the 
negotiations will be published. 
  The whole government machine is chugging along as if 
membership were on the cards, whereas public opinion poll 
figures show that almost 60 percent of the Swedish people are 
opposed to membership. What does Ulf Dinkelspiel think is the 
essential reason for this opposition? 
  "Uncertainty," he replied. "Many interacting factors," he 
added, without being specific. He repreated his criticism of 
the Social Democrats: 
  "When Sweden's largest party does not make up its mind, it 
is 
not easy for the voters to do so. Uncertainty is given 
legitimacy." 
  Ulf Dinkelspiel reiterated his prime arguments for 
membership: peace, jobs, prosperity. 
  Are these arguments believable? Look at Yugoslavia, look at 
the millions in Western Europe who are permanently unemployed.... 
  For Ulf Dinkelspiel this is simply confirmation of the fact 
that the European ideal has still not been fully achieved. 
  This time he did not say that better information will have 
an 
effect on the negative body of public opinion. Instead he spoke 
of commitment. Not only on the part of politicians, but also on 
the part of all Swedes who want a "yes." 
  "It is possible that we are allowing the 'no' side too much 
room for maneuver." 
  Is it not possible that the "yes" side's glossy picture of 
the EU as the solution to all problems has made the arguments 
less believable? Should it not draw attention to the problems 
and produce analyses in order to win people's confidence? 
  "Yes, I believe so," Ulf Dinkelspiel cried. "It is important 
to draw attention to the fact that membership has both 
advantages and disadvantages." 
  Mention a disadvantage! 
  "One of them is the net cost to Sweden. And in some respects 
the bureaucracy is something that I would want to be involved in 
reducing as a member. I will work for greater openness." 
  Ulf Dinkelspiel has the EU emblem in his lapel and an EU 
watch around his wrist. Could these not be taken as signs that 
he is more on the side of the EU than that of Sweden in the 
negotiations? 
  He sees them as symbols of the European ideal. 
  "The negotiations are not some zero-sum game. It is a 
question of finding joint solutions which are of mutual 
interest."

<F P=106> [Report by Dieter Kopp from Bonn] </F>
  [Text] At a news conference in Bonn today, Federal Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel commented on the prospects of the 
Bosnian-Croatian summit meeting on Petersberg near Bonn 
scheduled to begin tomorrow afternoon. Kinkel sees a slight ray 
of hope, but does not want to demonstrate too much optimism, 
because, Kinkel says, we have been bitterly disappointed too 
often. 
  In the scope of a comprehensive foreign policy tour 
d'horizon, Kinkel viewed the situation in the Balkans and 
stressed that the patience of the United Nations, the Europeans, 
and above all the French and British is not inexhaustible. We 
have arrived at a certain turning point, he said, adding that a 
mood is spreading showing that if the parties to the conflict do 
not really demonstrate their readiness to find a solution, they 
must consider that the troops will be withdrawn; this would 
mean, among other things, that no humanitarian relief can be 
provided for the needy any more. 
  There is no doubt that the federal foreign minister will 
inform the opponents about this assessment before their closed 
meeting begins tomorrow afternoon. 
  The participants in the negotiations, led by Presidents 
Alija 
Izetbegovic and Franjo Tudjman, will be alone. Possibly, the 
two mediators, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, will be 
called in. But this is a matter to be decided by the chief 
negotiators. 
  Kinkel does not see himself as a mediator. He said that Bonn 
will only host the meeting. The foreign minister will be in 
Berlin tomorrow evening, but his plane is ready to take off at 
any time in case he is needed on the Rhine. Kinkel, who in his 
own words was surprised by his role as a host -- the news 
reached him at his party's Epiphany meeting in Stuttgart -- 
believes the summit will, in any case, last until Sunday [9 
January]. 
  The main issues in his view will be an end to the fighting, 
the future of Mostar, and access to the sea. He is convinced 
that the Muslims will only be ready to sign any agreement on the 
Balkans under one condition, namely, that the Europeans 
guarantee its observance. 
  In his foreign policy tour d'horizon, Kinkel also commented 
extensively on the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels and the 
extension of NATO to the East, which will be discussed there. 
He predicted that there will be no guarantees of assistance for 
the East European states, and he also expressed understanding 
for the fact that Poland and other East European states are not 
satisfied with this development.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Croatian Ambassador to Germany </F>
Professor Ivan Ilic by unidentified announcer -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Ambassador, why was Bonn chosen as 
the venue for the talks between Franjo Tudjman and Alija 
Izetbegovic? 
  [Ilic] Why Bonn? One could say that President Tudjman made 
the suggestion to continue the talks in Bonn, after Vienna. 
President Izetbegovic agreed and both sides asked the German 
side to host the talks. Germany has so far made great efforts 
to bring about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has the complete 
trust of both sides. 
  [Announcer] So this initiative to choose Bonn as the venue 
for the meeting was made by Croatia and not by the German 
Government? 
  [Ilic] That is correct. [words indistinct] the initiative 
came from the Croatian side and, one could say, also from the 
Bosnian side. 
  [Announcer] Ambassador, could the German Government mediate 
a 
little during the meeting, even though the Foreign Ministry 
officially denies this? 
  [Ilic] As far as I can see, the Federal Republic of Germany 
will in this case not directly participate in the talks; it will 
only be the host. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] We now have the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which 
envisages a three-way split of Bosnia-Herzegovina into a Muslim, 
Croat, and Serb part. It is obvious that before such a plan is 
signed all sides will attempt to secure as much territory as 
possible. Should such a three-way split come about, will 
Croatia aim to unite with the Croatian territories in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the future? 
  [Ilic] Croatia wants, and it is in the interest of Croatia, 
that Bosnia-Herzegovina remains a whole, a whole state. Croatia 
does not want to annex anything. Croatia only wants to defend 
the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is obvious though 
that the Serbs want to create a greater Serbia and that is where 
the idea of a breakup of Bosnia-Herzegovina emerges. The 
Croatian side does not want this. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Bonn Foreign Ministry has 
rejected the claim by Russian right-wing extremist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy that German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel is 
prepared to receive him. There can be no question of this, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said in Bonn today. 
  The leader of the right-wing extremist Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia has "obviously got the wrong idea" he said. 
Kinkel said recently that it is necessary to come to terms with 
the political ideas of Zhirinovskiy's party. But no meeting or 
any other type of encounter is envisaged, Erdmann said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ulrich Irmer, foreign policy spokesman of </F>
the FDP Bundestag group, by Holger Wuchold in Bonn; date not 
given: "Dangerous Troublemaker"] 
  [Text] [Wuchold] Is the entry ban for Zhirinovskiy an 
appropriate means of combatting the fascist danger in Russia? 
  [Irmer] Of course, the rightist danger in Russia cannot be 
combated with an entry ban for Germany. This problem must be 
tackled in Russia itself. 
  But the decision made by Foreign Minister Kinkel is correct, 
because Zhirinovskiy obviously intends to make trouble in our 
country, too. 
  [Wuchold] Is Zhirinovskiy a danger to Germany's internal 
security? 
  [Irmer] He could be a danger. He says, for instance, that 
Poland must be divided and that Germany and Russia must have a 
common border. 
  This is contrary to our constitution and completely in 
violation of international law. Such a dangerous braggart must 
not agitate in our country. 
  [Wuchold] What can the West do to combat nationalism in 
Russia? 
  [Irmer] We must give the Russians the feeling that our 
involvement in East Europe is certainly not aimed against them, 
by means of security pacts, for instance. We must also 
considerably strengthen economic cooperation. 
  [Wuchold] The Russian Government says that the planned 
expansion of NATO and the European Union to the East would 
benefit the nationalists in that country. 
  [Irmer] The Russian nationalists are trying to exploit the 
expansion of NATO and the European Union for propaganda means. 
However, for Russia's stability itself it is indispensable that 
the states between Russia and Germany become stable democracies. 
Russia is not to be isolated but to be integrated in a system 
of collective security.

  [Excerpt] Hanover/Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In contrast to 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe favors the 
early accession of Poland, Hungary, and other reform states to 
NATO. There are also leading deputies within the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] 
parliamentary group who do not agree with Kohl's rejectionist 
stance, the HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG (Friday [7 January] 
edition) reports. 
  Within CDU/CSU circles in Bonn it was being said on Thursday 
that Ruehe is very disappointed that the Chancellor has 
"apparently changed" his stance following his talks with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin shortly before Christmas. This came as 
a shock to the Defense Ministry, the newspaper writes. Hence 
Ruehe is "quite relieved" not to have to attend the NATO summit 
next week. 
  Ruehe, it is being said within his entourage, is "very 
unhappy" that Kohl and Foreign Minister Kinkel attach great 
weight to U.S. concerns about broadening membership to the East. 
If Kohl takes the same view on the issue as he does, he should 
not relinquish that view because of diplomatic considerations, 
Ruehe says. 
  The report goes on to say that it is not enough to say 
simply 
that one does "not totally rule out" NATO membership for those 
states. Attempts must be made to bring about their entry. 
Support must be given in the political, economic, and military 
spheres. The Defense Ministry sees reform of the armed forces 
as a criterion for membership. Structures must be comparable 
and the military leadership must embrace the same values. There 
are reservations within the Defense Ministry on isolated 
membership for the Baltic states because here the risks are in 
reality greater than the benefits. [Passage omitted]

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN)-- Rainer Mueller, ambassador of 
the Federal Republic of Germany to Gabon, has been arrested on 
suspicion of spying for the former GDR state security service, 
according to a report in the BILD newspaper. According to 
information from the paper, Mueller, who was also press 
spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, worked for the Stasi on an 
"ideological basis"--and, therefore, free of charge--since 1974. 
Security authorities described the extent of betrayal as 
"considerable," the paper writes (Friday [7 January] edition). 
  Mueller went to Gabon as ambassador last spring. Although he 
has so far denied the charges, the arrest warrant is still in 
force. The investigations are continuing.

<F P=106> [Report signed "hjs": "Guenter Rexrodt Presents 10-Point </F>
Catalogue"] 
  [Text] Stuttgart, 6 Jan -- At the Epiphany meeting of the 
Free Democratic Party [FDP] in Stuttgart, party chairman and 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has distanced himself from his 
coalition partner, the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU]. He said he was opposed to making 
statements on a possible next coalition "at the wrong time." He 
said the FDP was seeking a double-digit result in the Bundestag 
elections. 
  The proposals made by Federal Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther (CDU) on the issue of the "great bugging campaign" are 
for Kinkel the "opening up of a secondary theater of war." 
Kinkel told HANDELSBLATT in Stuttgart that Kanther's behavior 
was harming the coalition because it had been agreed that the 
topic should not be discussed any more in this legislative 
period. 
  Kinkel also attacked CDU/CSU Bundestag floor leader Wolfgang 
Schaeuble. The FDP rejects Schaeuble's idea of making "the 
consideration of old values and virtues" a political program. 
  Regarding the problem of the FDP's position on the 
presidential candidate, Kinkel said, addressing Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher: "We need you, we rely on you, and you can count 
on us." Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher, who was given a rapturous applause 
at the Epiphany meeting, had said the day before that she would 
maintain her candidacy for the office of federal president until 
election day. 
  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt mentioned three problems 
that had to be solved economically -- the loss of the 
technological top position, the "excessive growth" of production 
costs, and the "over-regulation of society." 
  In this respect, Rexrodt presented a 10-point 
plan: 

  -  Continuing the austerity and consolidation 
course; 
  -  Introducing a wage freeze in the public service 
sector; 
  -  Submitting the basic data of a tax reform; 
  -  Abolishing 
the monopoly of the Federal Employment Office; 
  -  Amending the law 
on working hours; 
  -  Further privatizing public 
holdings; 
  -  Deregulation through the abolition of the Law 
Governing Discounts and a reform of the Law Against Dishonest 
Competition; 
  -  Consistent environmental policy based on market 
economy principles; 
  -  Reform of subsidized housing construction 
through income-oriented promotional measures; 
  -  Implementation of 
the GATT agreement on free world trade.

  [Excerpt] Stuttgart (DDP/ADN) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) [Free Democratic Party] has criticized his 
CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] 
partners in the Bonn coalition in unusually severe terms. 
Speaking at the Epiphany meeting of the Free Democrats in 
Stuttgart on Thursday [6 January], Rexrodt said that the Union 
is, like the SPD, "torn by internal divisions, blind in its 
populism, and incapable of taking unconventional decisions." 
Thus the CDU wants to "outdo the Social Democrats in the 
politics of redistribution of wealth." 
  Rexrodt added that the Union has "become paralyzed, 
cautious, 
anxious, and preoccupied with its different wings." The FDP has 
the unique opportunity "to put itself at the head of the 
movement which is fighting for the renewal of our economic and 
social order." Prosperity for all cannot be guaranteed with the 
traditional recipes. What is needed is a return to classical 
liberal ideas of a state based on the rule of law, market 
economy, and social responsibility. [passage omitted]

are beginning the mammoth election year of 1994 without any 
definite coalition plans. "We will decide before each election 
whether, when, and which coalition intentions we have," FDP 
[Free Democratic Party] chairman Klaus Kinkel said at the 
Liberals' Epiphany meeting in Stuttgart. The FDP wants to be 
involved in determining the shape of the government after the 
Bundestag elections, Kinkel stressed. The FDP chairman said his 
party is aiming for "a double-figure" share of the vote.

<F P=106> [Report by Klaus-Peter Schoeppner, managing director of the </F>
Emnid opinion research institute in Bielefeld: "Worries About 
Money and Jobs"] 
  [Text] The Emnid opinion research institute compiles 
important trends and topical data of opinion research for 
BERLINER ZEITUNG. This time the issue are political topics and 
events that affected the German citizens most in 1993. 
  The civil war in the former Yugoslavia is the clear loser 
among the topics and events that were discussed most heatedly by 
the German citizens in 1993. 
  While at the beginning of the year the horror in the Balkans 
was still considered to be the most pressing problem by 36 
percent of those polled, today only 12 percent are still 
interested in the war. Despite Christmas and the steadily 
increasing misery, hunger, and suffering there, the constant 
presence of the conflict in the media has left Germans 
shockingly unaffected by the war in the course of 1993. 
  Now we prefer to think of ourselves again. The more negative 
the reports about economic development, working short hours, and 
a mood of crisis became in the course of the year, the more 
frequent fear of one's own unemployment and somber financial 
prospects characterized everyday discussions. 
  At the moment, one out of three German citizens think that 
there is nothing more important to report. The specter of 
unemployment has thus become the top issue in 1993. 
  In mid-1993 it looked as if foreigners and asylum seekers 
would become the dominant issues. Following Solingen, the 
deportation or integration of foreigners was primarily discussed 
in 38 percent of the German living rooms. This was the highest 
monthly ratio measured in 1993 in the Emnid analyses of the most 
important public event, comparatively. However, the new asylum 
law and the drastic reduction in the number of applications of 
asylum since mid-1993 quickly removed the problem from Germans' 
minds. However, this was almost the only success by the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] in an annual political balance 
sheet, which gives the CDU an image of losers, failures, and 
cheats. This might have irreversible consequences not only for 
the FRG Government but for our entire political system. In 
1993, the year before the elections, political Germany turned 
into a different republic: Parties that achieve 45 percent of 
the votes may be a thing of the past. The big ones are getting 
small, the small ones are getting big: The CDU/Christian Social 
Union [CSU] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
together get hardly more than 70 percent of the votes right now. 
The coalitions of two parties, which have determined our 
political life for decades, will be a thing of the past, at 
least at the national level. 
  For the first time it seems possible that six parties will 
enter the next Bundestag. In 1993 political Germany has become 
a bit more unpredictable. 
  This is so primarily also because the politicians had to 
accept an unprecedented loss in their image due to mistakes, 
obscure machinations, and nepotism. While at the beginning of 
the year 65 percent of the voters believed that the political 
parties could solve the most important problems, now this is 
believed by only about 40 percent. In 1993 the politicians 
gambled away their claim of representing the people. 
  The voters are united only by the desire for more democracy 
at the grass roots and this provided clear majorities. More 
than four out of five voters want to be directly involved, 
regardless of which political decision has to be made. 
  The Federal Government also failed in its goal to bring 
Germans in the east and west closer together -- if not 
economically then at least psychologically. At the threshold to 
the ominous fourth year after Kohl's prediction of flourishing 
landscapes, the Germans have barely come closer to each other. 
  Two out of three west Germans still see the new German 
citizens as equals, for whom enough has already been done. A 
total of 85 percent of east Germans, on the other hand, still 
think that they are "second class" citizens. And concern rather 
than joy about the nation's unity is still the dominant feeling 
everywhere. 
  Has the 1994 Bundestag election already been decided? Is 
Kohl entering the last year of his chancellorship? After a 
minor upswing in summer, the political mood indicators indicate 
a seemingly clear result: Two-thirds of Germans expect the 
opposition to win and [SPD Chairman] Scharping to become 
chancellor. 
  Only 18 percent think that the CDU is ahead, but 40 percent 
think that the SPD is. And at the moment the SPD is increasing 
its share in the votes to 38 percent, compared with 35 percent 
for the CDU. 
  However, the SPD still does not have any reason for more 
than 
secret anticipatory joy, because evidence that the political 
constellations may change completely within only 10 months is 
remembered all too well by the government and the opposition: 
Ten months -- the exact time until the next Bundestag elections 
-- coincides with the period between March and December 1989, 
which the Federal Government of CDU/CSU and Free Democratic 
Party of Germany needed in the last legislative period to turn 
an absolute low in public opinion into the euphoria of victory. 
  In March 1989 only 20 percent (today 23 percent) of voters 
agreed with Chancellor Kohl's policy, 10 months later that 
number was 41 percent! And at that time even fewer voters -- 
namely 32 percent -- expected the CDU to win the elections. In 
December 1993 this was expected by 35 percent. 
  In the past Kohl has managed an unflagging advance to his 
clear reelection as the "chancellor of all Germans" within only 
10 months. 
  However, there is a small difference compared to that time 
now: Unification will not be available again next year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar: `Gonzalez Has Failed and </F>
Disappointed Society'"] 
  [Text] Salamanca -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria 
Aznar said yesterday he has the impression that there is a 
"makeshift situation" in Spanish politics, owing to the 
government's "inaction" and the internal disputes of the PSOE 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]. 
  The prime minister "has failed" and "disappointed society," 
Aznar stated. He added that he will not give up the task of 
opposition, although the party will act "responsibly" with 
respect to the crisis. He asserted that there is no other 
meeting with Felipe Gonzalez on his agenda. 
  At a news conference in Salamanca, Aznar took stock of the 
six months that have elapsed since the election, and noted that 
the main conclusion is that Felipe Gonzalez "has failed" both in 
his attempt to bring the nationalists into the government and in 
efforts to secure a social pact, and has shown that he does not 
know how to govern in a minority. 
<H5>  Unemployment and Recession </H5>
  The result of these six months from the economic viewpoint 
is 
more unemployment and recession; from the political viewpoint, 
the People's Party's consolidation as an alternative and the 
demonstration that the "change of change" proposed by the PSOE 
was an electoral alibi. 
  In this context, the People's Party leader demanded that the 
government correct its policy as a way to surmount Spain's 
"weakness," although he added that he does not expect this to 
happen and stressed that his party will act responsibly "so as 
not to exacerbate the crisis." 
  That responsibility does not imply relinquishing the task of 
opposition to a government lacking ideas in which Felipe 
Gonzalez "has disappointed society," he said. Regarding the 
prime minister, Aznar stated that the possibility of another 
meeting, following the meeting held two months ago which cleared 
the way for meetings between delegations of the two political 
forces, is not on his agenda. 
  He stated that these dialogues, "whether wanted or not, are 
constitutionally obligatory" for matters such as the choice of 
the ombudsman and the renewal of the General Council of the 
Judiciary, since "the qualified majorities are laid down in 
order to force agreements." 
  After emphasizing that the aim of any contact with the PSOE 
is to improve Spain's situation, Aznar ruled out the possibility 
of a government coalition and the imminence of another election. 
  He recalled that the Socialists rejected the agreement on 
economic policy proposed by the People's Party several months 
ago, and added that the presentation of recovery measures by his 
group is due to the fact that the government itself is 
presenting none.

<F P=106> [Mariano Guindal report: "Labor Reform Opposed by Trade </F>
Unions Endorsed by 90 Percent of Congress"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- All the parliamentary groups, except 
for the United Left, the Canary Islands Coalition, and the 
Republican Left of Catalonia representative, yesterday voted in 
support of the first part of the labor reform prepared by the 
government. In this way, the trade unions yesterday suffered 
their second political defeat -- the first was in the Economic 
and Social Council -- in their battle to prevent the Workers' 
Statute from being amended. 
  Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan stated after the debate 
that the trade unions are entitled to call a general strike and 
are free to make decisions independently on their own 
responsibility. "However, it must not be forgotten that over 90 
percent of the deputies representing the people's sovereignty 
have voted in favor of it, and this means that the vast majority 
of the population, whom they lawfully represent, are in favor." 
  The decree law on urgent measures concerning the labor 
market, introducing the new apprenticeship, practical training, 
and part-time contracts and legalizing nonprofitmaking 
employment agencies, was approved by 317 votes out of the 341 
cast, with 22 against and two abstentions. At the same time, 
all the deputies voted for the decree law to be handled as an 
ordinary law, with the aim of its joining the two bills amending 
substantial parts of the Workers' Statute which will be approved 
by the cabinet today. 
  This reform will be debated as a whole at the plenary 
session 
which will be held 20 January. This means that the debate will 
be held seven days before the general strike. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, Jan 7 (AFP) -- France will urge NATO at next 
week's summit to take a strong line on the conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia to "break out of the war cycle," Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe said in a radio interview Friday [7 
January]. 
  The 16 member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation must be prepared "to help the UN implement its 
resolutions by sending in additional troops and ensuring real 
protection in the safe areas," he said. 
  Juppe said the Brussels summit on January 10 and 11 should 
enforce a European Community peace plan agreed last year by 
building up sufficient land forces. 
  Under the plan, Bosnia-Hercegovina was to be partitioned 
into 
three ethnically-defined mini-states, with the Bosnian 
government controlling one third of the republic's present 
territory. 
  Juppe urged NATO to examine a French proposal to reopen the 
airport at Tuzla as a means of supplying humanitarian aid to the 
stricken population of central Bosnia. 
  He said responsibility for the war was shared among the 
three 
communities. 
  "We must break out of the war cycle," he said. If the 
fighting continued, countries with troops in Bosnia would sooner 
or later decide to withdraw them, causing an "explosion of war" 
throughout the Balkans, he told the Europe 1 station. 
  Late Thursday President Francois Mitterrand said the United 
Nations should resist mounting pressure to pull its forces out 
of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
  "I would not wish to see a withdrawal of the UN troops 
because that would amount to abandoning the civilian even more 
than they are already," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Joseph Mace-Scaron: "Head of State Denounces the </F>
Government's Policy"] 
  [Text] It is an impressionistic opposition. By a 
succession of little touches, Francois Mitterrand is undermining 
the polite cohabitation which has hitherto reigned between the 
Elysee and the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office]. 
  The head of state, who yesterday afternoon received the 
"nation's vital forces" at the Elysee (employers, trade unions, 
charity organizations, community movements, and so forth), spoke 
at length about his proposal for a "new social contract." 
  In his New Year's wishes, the president of the republic 
described 1993 as a "black year of unemployment" and urged 
Edouard Balladur, without naming him, to "help" the employers 
and trade unions to combat this scourge. 
  Speaking on Tuesday evening [4 January], the prime minister 
had reaffirmed his desire to include the struggle against the 
increase in unemployment on the top of his agenda for 1994. 
"With regard to the social pact," he reaffirmed that "for the 
first time in many years, the government which I head twice 
brought together the two sides of industry, the employers' and 
workers' organizations, in April." 
<H5>  "This Is A High Price To Pay" </H5>
  The whole question here is whether or not this is 
cooperation 
or organized consultation. "The question is whether we can sit 
down at a table and reach an agreement," the prime minister 
replied with extreme caution, "I am in favor of this in 
principle but that is not enough. The employers' and trade 
union organizations must be ready for it too." To verify this, 
Edouard Balladur has decided to establish "a number of contacts 
with some of them." 
  Francois Mitterrand probably judged the reply to be 
inadequate. The term "social pact" mentioned by Balladur was 
judged to be "irritating and disagreeable with regard to the 
past." The head of state thinks it is appropriate to "help 
revive a contractual policy which has been in abeyance for all 
too long." "I think that the contractual policy should help to 
form the social foundation for any social action in France." 
  But the head of state did not stop at this "encouragement." 
In front of a prime minister very busy counting the lights on 
the chandelier in the hall, he listed four courses. The first 
relates to the use of credits in the sphere of job creation: 
"We must consider that 300 billion francs [Fr] are devoted to 
it... That corresponds to 3 million jobs paid at the minimum 
wage!" "It is conceivable that such sums could be used to push 
back the evil rather than maintaining it," he stressed. 
  The second is a criticism of the government's policy which 
seeks, through the enterprises, "pools of jobs." "Oh, what a 
wonderful expression!" he said sarcastically: "I have noted that 
this year Fr80 billion have been transferred to the enterprises 
without any effect on employment. Heads of enterprise, this is 
a high price to pay!" Balladur looked down at his feet. 
  These are only possible courses: "I am not an inventor." 
But the president of the republic expressed the hope that the 
governmnent will "set to work" without delay. "This contractual 
policy, the foundation of any social policy, only requires a 
little imagination and time." Turning to the prime minister, he 
added: "I am not asking for an increase in state intervention 
(Balladur smiled -- LE FIGARO editor's note) but simply a 
transfer of funds to make them useful." 
  This is certainly not the end of cohabitation, but after his 
criticism of the repeal of the Falloux Law, it is clear that the 
head of state thinks that it is time to return to his role as a 
"spur." Through this "new social contract," Francois Mitterrand 
wants to force the government to expose itself more on the 
employment front. The Elysee is aware that, although Edouard 
Balladur's popularity is reaching great heights, a majority of 
French people disapprove of his policy. 
  By placing the emphasis on the employment issue, the 
president of the republic stresses this apparent paradox and 
thus gives the measure by which the public will gauge the 
success -- or failure -- of Balladur's policy. It is true that, 
in this sphere, he is helped by the promises made -- and not 
kept -- by the government. 
  These "digs" are being made at a time when the prime 
minister 
is observing some signs of economic recovery. What is more, 
Mitterrand is not content with a stabilization in the number of 
people seeking work: "We must achieve a reduction in 
unemployment, a reabsorption of long-term unemployment," he said 
yesterday. 
  If the Socialist Party were still in any doubt, the head of 
state's capacity for initiative remains intact.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "According to Mr. Leotard's </F>
Entourage, France Requested Military Assistance From Washington"] 
  [Text] A source close to Mr. Leotard revealed on Wednesday, 
5 January, that France has called on the United States to 
provide assistance for two military operations in Bosnia aimed 
at relieving the Muslim enclaves besieged by Serbs. The same 
source stated that Paris expects Washington to provide military 
air support and logistics assistance to reopen the Tuzla 
airfield in northern Bosnia and to make it possible for a Danish 
UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] armored column to 
relieve a Canadian unit in Srebrenica in the east. 
  Questioned on those statements, diplomats from the Quai 
d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] could not explain what France exactly 
sought from the United States. They said that Paris would urge 
the United States, at next week's NATO summit, to respect the 
commitments it made. 
  According to them, this refers to the military air support 
that NATO pledged to provide the blue helmets with last August 
if they needed it. But the diplomats stated that the UNPROFOR 
has never requested any such assistance, except for 
reconnaissance missions. 
<H5>  Mr. Mitterrand: "Unacceptable" </H5>
  Meanwhile, while receiving the New Year wishes of the 
diplomatic corps, President Mitterrand warned against the 
possibility of an "even more dramatic situation" in former 
Yugoslavia. He outlined the dilemma that faces the countries 
involved in the UNPROFOR. "Should we continue to let people kill 
each other to the last man? Should we stay and be the target 
that takes the blows of those who like death, as was said during 
the Spanish [Civil] War?" he asked. "In both cases, the 
situation is unacceptable. We thus must ensure that the 
development (...) of this deadlocked situation does not give 
rise to an even more dramatic situation."

  [Text] Paris, Jan 6 (AFP) -- The privatization of 
state-owned French companies will continue "at a sustained 
rhythm" in 1994, French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said 
Thursday [6 January], starting with an oil group and an 
insurance company. 
  The Elf Aquitaine oil and UAP insurance companies will be 
privatized "in the next few weeks," Alphandery announced 
Wednesday. 
  Providing further details Thursday, he said that current 
core 
shareholders in Elf Aquitaine would hold 10 percent of its 
capital after privatization. 
  A call for future core shareholders, who will hold 8.5 
percent of capital, will be launched in the official government 
journal at the weekend, while the remaining 1.5 percent reserved 
for core shareholders will be taken by Union des Assurances de 
Paris (UAP), he said. 
  The state will remain the leading shareholder in Elf 
Aquitaine, with 10 to 15 percent of the capital, through the 
Erap state holding company. It also reserves the right to veto 
an investor's crossing the limit of 10, 20 or 30 percent of 
capital or voting rights. 
  Elf Aquitaine's current stock market value exceeds 100 
billion French francs (17.25 billion dollars), 50.76 percent of 
which is controlled by Erap. 
  France is expecting to earn 55 billion francs (9.49 billion 
dollars) from privatization of state-owned companies in 1994, 50 
billion of which will go into the general budget. 
  Total state earnings from privatizations between 1994 and 
1997 are expected to reach 200 billion francs (34.5 billion 
dollars), bringing the budget deficit down to 2.5 percent of GDP 
(gross domestic product) in 1997, compared with 4.5 percent in 
1993. 
  The 1993 privatizations of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) 
bank and the Rhone Poulenc pharmaceutical company brought some 
41 billion francs (7.1 billion dollars) into French state 
coffers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aerospatiale Prepares For </F>
Privatization"] 
  [Text] The French aeronautical manufacturer Aerospatiale 
had a terrible year in 1993, according to its president, Louis 
Gallois, speaking yesterday. However, despite the crisis 
hitting both arms producers and aeronautical manufacturers, 
Aerospatiale is continuing with its preparations for 
privatization. 
  Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois yesterday presented an 
initial review of the group's activity. In doing so he failed 
to avoid the usual speech of the last two years: How the 
economic crisis and the slowing of activity have hit the group's 
civil business, while the reduction in military budgets has 
impacted on arms activity. All told, Aerospatiale had a 
terrible 1993. However, although coming at the expense of a 
drastic restructuring and reduced investment (down to four 
percent of revenues as opposed to nine percent in previous 
years), company debt should have been reduced by about one and a 
half billion French francs [Fr]. Although it is still not 
possible to come up with an exact figure, the result for 1993 
should not be as bad as last year. 
  Nonetheless, it should be noted that the new head of the 
aircraft division, Claude Terrazzoni, who has only just taken up 
the post, will not have an easy job. It is true that production 
has risen to about 138 aircraft and a delivery record was broken 
last December, when 20 machines were handed over to client 
companies. The outlook for future years, however, looks much 
bleaker. The balance of new orders to cancelled orders is zero 
for Airbus Industrie and amounts to some 30 aircraft for ATR. 
Moreover, 500 aircraft of previous generations, currently 
"cocooned," have become profitable again thanks to the drop in 
the price of petroleum products. This should encourage 
companies to dip into their stocks before they take out new 
orders. 
  From the military and space point of view, Louis Gallois 
could congratulate himself on the fact that the French budget 
was not as bad as had been feared. It would appear that 
Aerospatiale has faired better than some of its competitors, 
and, according to its president, it can claim to be the top 
European missile producer. In addition, the success of the 
European Ariane rocket launcher has had positive effects for the 
whole industry, and for satellites in particular. The weighting 
of these different elements gives an impression of solidity in 
spite of everything, with orders worth Fr130 billion -- the 
equivalent of two and a half years' activity. Nevertheless, 
revenues for 1993 were once more down by about four and a half 
percent over the previous year, at Fr49.3 billion. 
  It is fair to say that Louis Gallois, without promising 
"blood and tears," warned that there was no question of reducing 
the efforts made within the company. All the more so since 
Aerospatiale is one of the companies that could be privatized 
and it would be best to improve its situation still further. 
Its president believes that the operation is not likely to go 
ahead this year, and probably not in 1995 either. However, an 
initial stage, with the arrival of new financial partners, could 
well precede the actual privatization. It would then coincide 
with the accounts once more balancing out, which Louis Gallois 
hopes to achieve in 1996.

last week of last year, according to information from the 
central bank's weekly statistics released on Thursday [6 
January]. 
  That made a total of 10 billion francs on December 30, 
against 6.6 billion on December 23. 
  The reserves plunged deep into the red last summer during 
the 
European monetary crisis.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 6 (AFP) -- France is forming a new 
agency directed by a senior police official to fight illegal 
immigration and will resume deportations of illegal aliens to 
discourage the world's poor from flooding the country. 
  The new agency, to be called the Central Directorate for 
Immigration Control and the Fight Against Employment of Illegal 
Aliens (DICILEC), will begin operations on January 15 with 
senior police official Robert Broussard at its head. 
  Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, who announced the move on 
French television late Wednesday [5 January], said the 
government was "obliged to take coercive and administrative 
measures" to stem the tide of illegal aliens. 
  "Once we have sent back several planeloads or boatloads, the 
world will get the message," he said, referring to the 
deportation of aliens aboard government-chartered transportation. 
  The government was forced to give up this method after the 
deportation of 101 Malians by chartered aircraft in October 1986 
caused a popular uproar in France. 
  Arguing that France "cannot take on the misery of the entire 
world," Pasqua warned that the country's immigration problems 
could only get bigger. 
  The system in Eastern Europe has disintegrated and "if 
clashes break out there, we will not avoid a huge wave of 
immigration," he said. 
  In Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, Pasqua said that "by the 
end 
of the decade there will be 130 million North Africans, 
including nearly 60 million aged under 20 with no prospects and, 
further south, one billion other Africans." 
  He noted, however, that coercion and new rules would "not 
solve the problem alone." France should lead a "crusade for 
development" in countries where the emigrants came from, he said. 
  "If one percent of GDP (gross domestic product) were devoted 
to this, the problem would be solved," he said. 
  The 1993 state budget allocated 0.58 percent of GDP to 
development aid. 
  France is currently home to 4.1 million foreigners out of a 
total population of 57 million. 
  Each year up to 100,000 people enter French territory 
legally, usually by joining relatives residing there (58,000 in 
1991) or by requesting political asylum (about 12,000 in 1991). 
  Pasqua hopes this figure will be halved as a result of 
measures taken since the conservative government of Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur came to power in March. 
  Over the past several months, several laws -- some of which 
required a modification of the constitution -- have tightened 
controls over immigration in France. 
  Because of these new laws, the right to asylum has been 
restricted, the conditions for acquiring residency permits and 
French nationality have been tightened and deportation measures 
have been relaxed. 
  There were 568 deportations from France from January 1 to 
October 31, a 21 percent increase over the same period in 1992. 
  French police have also carried out an increasing number of 
identity-control operations over the past few weeks. 
  According to a survey conducted in October, 59 percent of 
the 
French population consider immigration as a threat to the 
economy and 58 percent feel there are too many immigrants in the 
country.

<F P=106> [Article by Francoise Crouigneau: "Alexandre Lamfalussy: An </F>
Economist Fascinated by Public Service"] 
  [Text] Independent spirit but profoundly 
consensual. 
  Extremely courteous but capable, with his soft and precise 
voice, of driving home his technical points in discussions with 
students, ministers, or central bank governors. Alexandre 
Lamfalussy, the first president of the European Monetary 
Tnstitute (EMI), masks his passions and his horror of extremes 
with a talent nearly void of nuance. But one should not be 
mistaken. Although this 64-year-old Belgian of Hungarian origins 
has proven his sharp sense of compromise, he will still be a 
rigorous and demanding interlocutor for EU central bankers as 
well as ministers of economy and finance. Elected unanimously 
for contradictory reasons--some expect a low profile from him, 
others an activism allowing the fluid powers granted the EMT 
under the Maastricht Treaty to be reinforced--he will not let 
his actions be dictated. And will remain faithful to the triple 
credo which marked his unorthodox professional life: a 
fascination for public service, a deep European character, and 
an attachment to economic theory when it constitutes a simple 
tool of action. 
<H5>  Looking For Innovations </H5>
  His expression alternately one of concentration or 
mischieviousness under a high forehead encircled with white 
hair, Alexandre Lamfalussy knows that he does not have too rich 
an experience with which to approach his new tasks. The son of 
an engineer who worked for the Water and Forestry Service, 
Lamfalussy's European roots date from his college years spent 
with the Benedictines in close association with the prestigious 
Belgian University of Louvain. Skeptical of the seriousness of 
political sciences, he opted in 1947 for "the appearance of 
rigor" which he found in the economic sciences when he entered 
the Polytechnical University of Budapest. 
  Soon aware that his instruction there was becoming more and 
more Marxist, that the iron curtain which Stalin erected was 
ending the democratic reconstruction of Hungary, he fled his 
country in 1949 without hope of returning. With $10 for his 
entire trip, he arrived in Vienna with three friends and took 
part in that city's bad days, the days of the "Third Man" 
symbolized by Orson Welles. He then went to Belgium and the 
University of Louvain where he followed a course in which his 
economic research and his teaching never ceased to mingle with 
his banking and public official duties, both mutually enriching. 
  "Investment and Growth in Advanced Economies: The Belgian 
Case" was the theme of the doctorate presented in 1957 by the 
young Lamfalussy at Oxford--a university less doctrinaire than 
Cambridge--and was the first illustration of his constant desire 
to link theory with concrete reality. Working at the Bank of 
Brussels, he discovered the interaction between the financial 
sector and the real economy. 
  Looking for something new, he was involved from the start 
when the Bank of Brussels participated in the first issue of 
Eurobonds ever launched. This was in 1963. And while today $15 
million raised for the Italian "autostrada" elicits a smile, at 
the time this sort of operation--imagined by Warburg--was a true 
revolution. "The Financial Markets in Europe," which he 
published in 1968, bears the mark of this event. As does the 
year he spent at Yale in the early 1960's as a lecturer, at the 
invitation of Robert Triffin--also a Belgian, whose background 
seriously influenced him: He predicted the scuttling of the 
Bretton Woods international monetary system and then denounced 
the dysfunctional floating exchange rate system, before 
forecasting the creation of a European Monetary System and the 
promotion of the ECU to challenge the domination of the dollar. 
<H5>  At the Head of BIS in 1985 </H5>
  Having become a banker and renowned university professor, 
Alexandre Lamfalussy did not avoid painful experiences. Kingpin 
of the merger which gave birth to the Brussels Lambert Bank, he 
discovered, at his own expense, the evils of monetary 
speculation. If he did not feel himself directly implicated in 
the enormous loss of foreign exchange incurred by the Bank of 
Brussels, he nonetheless assumed responsibility for it and 
declined the presidency of the board of Brussels Lambert in 
1975. His heart was no longer in it. And when he was offered the 
position as the head of the monetary department of the Bank for 
International Settlements (BIS) in 1976, he turned a new page of 
his professional life without regret. 
  Moving to Basel did not cut him totally out of the 
University 
of Louvain where he continued to teach until he entered the 
upper management ranks of BIS. He considered his contact with 
students a veritable mental health necessity in order not to be 
engulfed by the "central bank culture" where the priority given 
to a healthy management was rarely on a par with that given to 
hardly-orthodox and less-than-visionary ideas. But, since 1985 
and his arrival at the head of the BIS--this revolving door for 
central banks which also insures some of their financial 
operations--no major financial or monetary issue has escaped him. 
  Hailed as much for his management as for his legendary 
discretion by central bankers to whom he reported during the 
past eight years, Lamfalussy, who now outranks these bankers as 
president of the EMI, will play a discrete but decisive role in 
the years to come. This role will be played out in the difficult 
analysis of issues such as the globalization of the financial 
system, the poorly defined explosion of hedging that now drives 
the derivative products market, and especially the progress 
toward Economic and Monetary Union. 
  A member of the Delors Committee which provided the monetary 
basis of the Maastricht Treaty, Alexandre Lamfalussy knows all 
the problems of trying to establish a single currency, an effort 
which seems to him indispensable for the future of Europe. He 
knows the political potholes which are waiting and the 
reticences of central bankers who intend to retain all their 
prerogatives. He also knows the total commitment and 
imagination it takes to create a new tool, the EMU, which is 
supposed to turn itself into a European Central Bank. In effect, 
he will have to establish coordinating mechanisms such as a 
credible method to oversee the Twelve's monetary and 
macroeconomic policies. A delicate task since recessionary fears 
and the constraints of national and European elections may push 
certain governments to relax their vigilance. One can count on 
Alexandre Lamfalussy to take them to task, publicly if 
necessary. But can he succeed in asserting himself in the face 
of European heavy weights? He, who was among the first to be 
stigmatized by the excess of Thatcherism or who once discretely 
denounced the stubborness of the Bundesbank? 
  Although he is known to have been chosen for this position 
because of his freedom of thought and his capacity to not abuse 
it, his authority comes from the quiet recognition that, not 
having been candidate for the presidency of the EMI, he has 
nothing to lose. And if the chemistry of this institution does 
not take hold, or it displeases him, he will take pleasure in 
again finding his place at the university, in writing, and in 
enjoying the home he inherited on the shores of Lake Balaton in 
Hungary where he produces a famous wine. And these solitary 
pleasures have for a long time been the source from which he 
yearly replenishes himself.

<F P=106> [Article by Jerome Thorel: "To Forget Mururoa, Is It </F>
Possible To Simulate a Nuclear Explosion?"] 
  [Text] The fate of nuclear testing is currently being 
discussed around microscopic silica and polymer capsules. 
Attempts are being made to reproduce the phenomenon of 
controlled fusion in pellets filled with a gas similar to 
hydrogen. The current moratorium on nuclear testing -- with the 
possibility of a total ban treaty -- has led the major powers to 
begin vast simulation research programs. The final goal is to be 
able to begin a real process of "virtual dissuasion" and to 
design thermonuclear weapons without the need for a full scale 
testing stage. 
  For the experts in the Atomic Energy Commission's (CEA) 
Military Applications Department (DAM), a nuclear test is 
already a simulation -- a real simulation. In an interview with 
SCIENCES ET AVENIR, DAM Chief Roger Baleras insisted that 
"performing a test is not the same as designing a weapon. Of 
course, the testing is done to `qualify' a weapon, but it is 
also a way for us to check our propositions in physics." A test 
serves to validate the theoretical laws of basic physics. 
Encyclopedic manuals tell us that there are mathematical models 
that can simulate every basic aspect of an explosion (equations 
of state, hydrodynamics, neutron transport, and radiation 
transfer). 
  Running on supercomputers, these models become numerical 
codes that make it possible to follow the thermodynamics of the 
system (pressure, density, temperatures, etc.), finally giving 
the energy balances and the effects of nuclear reactions. To 
ensure that the physical laws are correct, the codes must be 
supplied and validated using experimental data -- obtained from 
nuclear testing. The current challenge is to validate these 
numerical codes with supercomputers rather than nuclear tests. 
There are two main categories of test: Safety and reliability 
tests related directly to designing new weapons and maintaining 
the existing stockpile; and tests to calculate the destructive 
effects of the atomic charges. 
  Of the four "recognized" atomic powers, only the United 
States and France have an advanced simulation program. In 
France, the simulation program started in 1991 by the DAM was 
christened PALEN (Preparation for the Limitation of Nuclear 
Testing). The brain center for the operation was the 
Limeil-Valenton research facility, to the east of Paris. In the 
United States, where simulation work has been underway for a 
much longer time, the current AGEX (Above Ground Experiments) 
program draws its impetus from the fact that the three national 
nuclear research centers are competing with each other (Lawrence 
Livermore in California, and Los Alamos and Sandia in New 
Mexico). These programs are highly confidential. However, in 
this sea of "classified" data, the calmer waters of civil 
research into "controlled fusion" gives a slightly clearer view. 
  For the military physicists, the basic problem -- 
reproducing 
in the laboratory the temperature, density, and radiation 
conditions in the confined area inside a nuclear weapon -- ties 
in with the civil race to "harvest" the energy produced by the 
fusion of hydrogen or its isotopes. In both cases an energy 
gain is sought: The energy released must be greater than the 
energy consumed by the reaction. In the civil domain, this gain 
is converted into electricity, while in the military domain it 
is converted into physical data. Simulation is only worthwhile 
if the phenomenon can be measured (if there is an "outgoing 
radiation"), or in other words, if the energy released is 
greater than the original energy. 
  This is the problem for fusion reactions. The principle 
comes down to switching from an environment of light atoms to 
heavier elements. This creates a mass defect which is at the 
source of energy. The most efficient type of reaction consists 
of fusing the nuclei of deuterium and tritium (hydrogen 
isotopes). The neutron and nucleus of helium (an alpha 
particle) carry kinetic energy equivalent to 350 MJ (megajoules) 
per gram of deuterium-tritium mixture, i.e., as much energy as 
would be generated from the combustion of 10,000 liters of crude 
oil. In a thermonuclear bomb, this same gramme of 
deuterium-tritium releases energy equivalent to 20 tonnes of 
TNT. Nuclear physics has its limitations, however. Notably, 
this type of fusion requires temperatures in the region of 50 
million degrees Celsius. In these conditions, the matter is in 
a plasmic state, meaning that the ions and electrons are 
dissociated. The reason for such high temperatures is that 
positive ions increasingly repel each other the closer they are 
together. To fuse them they have to impact at high speed, and 
it is this collision which generates the very high temperatures. 
  How is this plasmic state of matter obtained? In a 
thermonuclear bomb, the fusion of deuterium and tritium is 
obtained by a fission reaction, with a mini A-bomb sparking the 
combustion. To simulate this type of explosion in the 
laboratory, another source of heat was required: particle beams 
or lasers (photon beams). In any event, what is needed is a 
fairly intense impulse to heat the matter to its ignition 
temperature. While laser is the most advanced method, we still 
need energy sources a hundred times more powerful than we have 
today to produce a sufficient gain. 
  A French expert states: "Using very powerful lasers, we can 
reproduce in the laboratory the conditions (temperature, 
density, etc.) similar to those that exist inside nuclear 
weapons. We are simply trying to validate the numerical codes 
that in the past we checked by carrying out real tests." The 
Phebus laser used by the DAM at Limeil can generate several 
kilojoules (kJ) of energy. When applied to matter, this gives 
"hot plasmas" of several dozen million degrees, which is enough 
to recreate the heat conditions inside a thermonuclear weapon. 
  It then remains for us to recreate the same conditions of 
density. To do this, laser science is opening the way up to 
"inertial confinement" fusion (ICF), competing on the civil 
level with magnetic confinement: The Joint European Torus (JET) 
experiments in this area have already been described at length. 
In either case, the plasma has to be kept confined long enough 
for a sufficient number of fusion reactions to occur. 
  The exact use of inertial fusion for simulations remains 
"defense classified." Nevertheless, ICF -- initially designed 
with military aims in mind -- gives researchers an effective way 
of bringing matter in the laboratory to densities comparable 
with those inside a weapon. The DAM claims that there is 
another way to do this. 
  The many parameters needed for good implosion are ensured by 
the type of laser impulse used. Lasting just one nanosecond, 
this impulse is tunable to the point where cold compression of 
the target occurs (this is better for gaseous bodies) while 
creating hot spots (the condition required for ignition). The 
quality of the implosion depends greatly on the beam wavelength. 
In the context of civil thermonuclear fusion research for 
energy production, the work with hot plasma done by the French 
National Scientific Research Center's (CNRS) Laboratory for the 
Use of Intense Lasers (LULI), based in the Polytechnic school at 
Palaiseau, has shown that short wavelengths (0.26 micron and 
0.35 micron) are more efficient for converting laser beam energy 
into plasma heat energy. 
  French and American experts stress, however, that this light 
impulse is not sufficiently uniform to attack or light the 
target: compression must be symmetrical at every point of the 
silica shell. Civil and military experts know that X-rays can 
give a finer degree of uniformity, and this led to the so-called 
"indirect attack" principle. The light energy is first 
converted into X-ray radiation and it is this that then attacks 
the target. In addition, X-rays have shorter wavelengths than 
lasers (10,000 times shorter). Since they carry more energy 
than the visible rays, X-rays can better penetrate the solid. 
We should note that this is one of the most "classified" 
aspects of the simulation debate, with indirect attack touching 
on the same aspects of radiation transfer as inside a weapon. 
In PHYSICS TODAY, John Lindl's team summarized the state of 
official data: "A laser beam or a particle beam is first 
absorbed in a cavity (a complex target, termed an `empty space') 
which embodies the capsule. This cavity then emits X-rays which 
attack the capsule until it implodes (...) The ablations of a 
target attacked by X-rays are hydrodynamically more stable." No 
further details are given, of course, on the conversion method 
or the materials used. 
  Nevertheless, at the current time, no laser exists that is 
powerful enough to exceed the famous break-even [preceding word 
in English] point, i.e., capable of releasing more energy than 
it uses. The world's experts agree that what is needed is an 
ICF reactor capable of supplying megajoules of energy. This 
estimation results from the Halite/Centurion experiment carried 
out in the United States in the mid-1980's, in which the X-rays 
produced during a nuclear test were claimed to prove the 
feasibility of ICF by indirect attack. We are still a long way 
off, however: Currently, the largest laser in the world, the 
Nova at the Lawrence Livermore site, is capable of producing 
"only" 40 kJ. At the same frequency (0.35 micron) and for the 
same impulse time (1 nanosecond) the Phebus laser (American in 
origin) can supply 8 kJ. To arrive at the MJ or "Upgrade" 
[preceding word in English] laser, we need to increase power by 
a factor of 100. France and the United States are working 
together in this area to reduce costs by designing other 
amplification methods. 
  Even if laser technology has an uncertain future -- the 
Americans claim that heavy ion particle beams (xenon, cesium, 
and bismuth) are better suited for the development of an ICF 
reactor -- it still remains the most advanced technology. Thus 
the first stage in the AGEX program will begin with the National 
Ignition Facility (the $400-million successor to the Nova 
laser). This new 1-to-2-MJ laser is expected to be able to 
produce an energy gain of 20-30 MJ...but not before the year 
2002. A recent study showed that this installation will already 
be able to simulate many of the tests examining the effects of 
nuclear weapons. 
  The French PALEN project appears less certain. Military 
experts state: "There will be no simulation tools if we are not 
allowed to validate them. In other words, we need to perform 
another series of experiments if we are to eliminate the need 
for them." The Americans would appear to be some way ahead in 
this area. According to a report issued by the Defense 
Committee of the National Assembly in November, 40 tests have 
already been performed in the United States to validate 
simulation instruments, as opposed to just one in France. The 
same report underlines that at least 10 tests are needed before 
1997 if PALEN is to be developed, but the DAM has refused to 
comment on these figures. This program -- which will have a 
budget of 600 million French francs next year -- is only a 
preparation for the limitation of testing. A ministerial source 
states that the development of new types of weapons, such as 
those with variable power or triggered electromagnetically, will 
always require real tests, thus rejecting the political 
possibility of a "Comprehensive Test Ban" (CTB) on nuclear 
testing. No doubt political decisions will continue to affect 
what is a truly scientific challenge, with those small silica 
capsules acting as the scapegoat.

<F P=106> [Sebastiano Messina report: "Ciampi Evades Last Trap"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- It was evening by the time Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi left his office in Chigi Palace to report to the 
president. He put on his coat, turned to one of his closest 
aides, and revealed his good humor with a smile: "But politics 
is no picnic..." No, the prime minister is not at all worried. 
In the past 48 hours he has received approval and support from 
the members of the former four-party alliance, but also from the 
right and left -- even [Italian Social Movement, MSI, Secretary] 
Fini said he is willing to accept this government until the 
elections, as long as the elections take place as soon as 
possible -- and now the 12 January parliamentary debate no 
longer represents a trap for Ciampi. 
  When Scalfaro received the prime minister yesterday evening, 
Ciampi conveyed to him his "satisfaction" with the outcome of 
the consultations, a satisfaction based on the fact that the 
parties' "differing positions" are brought together "by a lofty 
sense of national responsibility." In other words, everyone 
recognizes the dangers facing the country's economy and 
international credibility; everyone is aware of how high the 
stakes are. Strengthened by the support of the president, who 
has recently discreetly discouraged all attempts to extend 
artificially the life of the republic's 11th parliament until 
June, Ciampi is preparing for next Wednesday [12 January] fairly 
calmly, partly because it seems increasingly evident that it is 
Scalfaro that will make the final decision to dissolve 
parliament. 
  The request by the former four-way alliance parties to grant 
parliament three months in which to reform the procedures for 
modifying the Constitution, to grant Italians abroad the vote, 
and to approve the [Justice Minister] Conso bill seems bound not 
to be taken up. "They could have thought about it earlier," 
people at the Quirinale [president's office] are saying. There 
is still a chance for another request -- to postpone the decree 
dissolving parliament by a few weeks, at least until 30 January, 
so as to hold the elections 10 April. The official reason -- 
repeated to Ciampi again yesterday by the SVP [South Tirol 
People's Party] and the Ladostan Union -- is to permit the 
approval of a number of laws, including the amendments to the 
law on the European elections. 
  In fact this justification conceals two other plans -- one 
"parliamentary," the other political. The former is the motive 
for a group of some 100 deputies and senators who fear arrest if 
they lose their parliamentary seats and who want to abolish 
arrest for a number of offenses. The latter, shared by the DC 
[Christian Democratic Party], [Fininvest President] Berlusconi, 
and [Radical leader] Pannella, is to gain at least three weeks 
in order to permit the proper establishment of the People's 
Party, to grant the Rooting for Italy group more time to win 
support, and to continue the gathering of signatures for 
Pannella's and Bossi's referendum until the end of January. 
  The new factor emerging from these consultations is that the 
League -- after suggesting that Scalfaro dissolve parliament 
before the new constituencies were defined, and after announcing 
the withdrawal of its representatives from parliament as an 
extreme demand for an immediate election -- is now aiming no 
longer at 20 March, realistically the earliest possible date, 
but at 10 April, adding its own voice to those demanding that 
Scalfaro defer signing the decree a little longer. The League's 
Senate floor leader, Francesco Speroni, has issued a new threat 
to the Quirinale ("unless the elections are held 10 April we 
will return to parliament and engage in unprecedented 
obstructionism") and [League ideologue] Miglio has again asked 
Scalfaro to "honor what he said in Bologna," but neither has 
asked the president to dissolve parliament right away. Now the 
League would be satisfied with a dissolution at the end of the 
month. Bossi's haste seems to have vanished into thin air; the 
League's anxiety seems to have cooled inexplicably. 
  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi revealed to his interlocutors yesterday 
that he will open the debate on the no-confidence motion with a 
brief speech ("I will not speak for more than half an hour") and 
that he wants to hear what all the floor leaders have to say 
before reaching any decision. According to Rete floor leader 
Diego Novelli, "the prime minister ruled out absolutely 
categorically both a reshuffle and a government crisis steered 
toward a second term." 
  So it is possible that, after listening to the various 
parties' positions, the prime minister will tender his 
resignation to the president and initiate the procedures for 
dissolving parliament. "You must not await the elections," the 
Greens advised him. 
  After talking with Ciampi, SVP Alto-Adige Deputy Roland Riz, 
told journalists that he felt that the government "is inclined 
to hold an election before the European elections." This is 
nothing new. But then Riz added: "How long before, I do not 
know. Maybe a week." However, this suggestion was flatly denied 
by Chigi Palace. 
  Evidently with none of his interlocutors did Ciampi venture 
to forecast the election date, though it is no secret that the 
Chigi Palace now regards only the four dates between 20 March 
and 10 April as realistic. [Rete Secretary] Orlando, Fini, and 
Cossutta told Ciampi that they prefer the earliest feasible 
date, namely 20 March, and Novelli went through the calendar 
with him to show that it is impossible to go beyond that date 
without risking further parliamentary traps. "There are people 
in the lower house," he told him, "that live with the fear of 
going to prison once they leave there, and they would be willing 
even to start a war with San Marino just to extend this 
parliament." The prime minister smiled, but made no comment on 
the observation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pier Ferdinando Casini by Rosanna </F>
Lampugnani; place and date not given: "Casini: `I Am no 
Troublemaker. An Alliance With the League Is Permissible'"] 
  [Text] [Christian Democratic Party, DC, Secretary] 
Martinazzoli says he has taken note of the centrists' farewell? 
Pier Ferdinando Casini confutes: "If he thinks we are leaving, 
he is mistaken. He must be the one to throw us out." 
  [Lampugnani] But have you been thrown out or not? 
  [Casini] We do not have the complex of being troublemakers. 
But we do not understand what we are being thrown out of since 
the DC no longer exists and the PPI [Italian People's Party] has 
not been founded yet. The truth is that we find ourselves 
entangled in an inextricable contradiction, which has been 
caused, among other things, by procedures that are not very 
clear and that are forcing us once again to call on the party's 
National Council to address all the problems. 
  [Lampugnani] But do you still feel DC members or a part of 
something else? 
  [Casini] We are currently experiencing a transitional phase 
in which everybody is equal. 
  [Lampugnani] In reality Martinazzoli is saying that you are 
now another party, that you have, in effect, placed yourselves 
outside the DC. 
  [Casini] And we have taken note of his statements. The real 
problem is a political one, because there can be no casus belli 
of this kind. In the DC there has always been a plethora of 
position without any need for disciplinary measures to be taken. 
In reality the left of the party has been given the freedom of 
action that has been denied to us. 
  [Lampugnani] You are the only ones however, that have 
prepared an authentic political program. 
  [Casini] Our program was presented to the DC. But when are 
we supposed to have discussed it since nobody has been meeting 
on this issue for the past six months? 
  [Lampugnani] Meanwhile you have discussed it with everybody 
else. 
  [Casini] Not with [Fininvest President] Berlusconi, but with 
Maroni [Northern League lower house floor leader], [Radical 
leader] Pannella, Republican member Castagnetti, and Ferri 
[Italian Social Democratic Party secretary]. Moreover, talking 
with parliamentary representatives is not forbidden as yet. 
Should [DC left-wing faction leader] Bindi not have been 
allowed to meet with the AD [Democratic Alliance] or the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left]? Debate is a part of politics, 
not a disciplinary matter. 
  [Lampugnani] What will happen now. What will you do? 
  [Casini] Since Martinazzoli is calling for discussions on 
the succession to the DC, we are asking for the immediate 
summoning of the party's National Council. On that occasion we 
will verify if there any difficulties in our cohabiting with the 
others, or if a transfer is necessary. 
  [Lampugnani] League member Maroni views the position adopted 
by Martinazzoli toward you to be his first act in taking the DC 
over to the left. Do you concur with this analysis? 
  [Casini] I do not need Maroni to make this type of 
judgement. I say that, just as the PDS is organizing an alliance 
that goes from [Communist Renaissance Chairman] Cossutta to 
[Italian Liberal Party member] Battistuzzi, we have a duty to do 
the same with Formentini [Milan mayor and League member]. 
  [Lampugnani] You have reached breaking point with the DC. 
Do you fear a split that will break the party in two? 
  [Casini] Of course, but we have done nothing to encourage 
it. 
  [Lampugnani] Will the process of aggregating the 
neo-centrists be speeded up? 
  [Casini] I only stress that I did not invent what Segni said 
about the League. This process of acceleration is occurring 
openly. The construction of the People's Party is the only thing 
that is proceeding slowly. The truth is that Martinazzoli wants 
us to be the ones to say: We are leaving. Well, if he wants 
that gesture, let him make it. Let him be the one to throw us 
out. I repeat: we are asking the National Council to dissolve 
the DC and then give birth to twins or whatever.

<F P=106> [Stefano Marroni report: "The Christian Democrats' Fall"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- In the beginning was the breakup of the PCI 
[Italian Communist Party], split by the collapse of the Berlin 
Bettino [Craxi] and torn apart by the corruption investigations. 
Now, on a bright morning in January 1994, the time has come for 
the DC [Christian Democratic Party] -- the last of Italy's major 
parties -- to acknowledge that it can no longer remain united. 
In other words, that the miracle is over for the Great White 
Whale, too. 
  By one of the paradoxes of history, it fell to the mild 
Martinazzoli, the Hamlet-like Mino, to certify the death of the 
miracle, to certify that as of today, while some people remain 
in, others are out. In other words, to say that only he and his 
supporters are heirs to the DC, and that Mastella, Casini, 
D'Onofrio, and the rest are already "another party." It is up 
to him to guarantee that from now on those we have hitherto 
called Christian Democrats will each stand on their own side -- 
albeit involved right away in already familiar struggles over 
the name, symbol, and assets of the DC. 
  The dramatic event that [DC founder] De Gasperi's heirs have 
tried desperately to avert for months suddenly took place in a 
little more than a minute. That is, as long as it took Mino 
Martinazzoli to emerge from DC headquarters and to enter the 
Brescia-registered BMW belonging to his trusted friend, Domenico 
Berterici. He was intercepted by three agency reporters: "So, 
Mr. Martinazzoli, are you still angry with the centrists, after 
yesterday's meetings with Maroni, [Radical leader] Pannella, and 
the nondenominational parties?" He turned round with an 
expression of surprise and averred that he was not angry: "It 
seems clear to me," he said deliberately, "that the 
neo-centrists have taken their leave. And I acknowledge the 
fact." There ensued an icy silence appropriate to such an 
important occasion. Martinazzoli went on: "This is not simply 
my opinion: When they behave like a party, with their own 
government program and their own strategy and when they hold 
talks with other political interlocutors, I acknowledge the 
fact. I do so calmly." And he calmly went on: "I only know 
that they are another party. Apart from that, if they want to 
talk about the succession to the DC, I am willing...." 
  That was all there was to it. Martinazzoli, the last 
secretary of the DC, closed the car door and left. But it was 
not long before the "little" that he did say became news. And 
when it did become news it immediately elicited a torrent of 
responses from a party that has now realized that it has reached 
the end of the road. Martinazzoli was immediately granted 
support by those with whom the secretary met yesterday morning 
-- Franco Marini, Pierluigi Castagnetti, and Rosa Russo 
Jervolino, even though when she arrived at DC headquarters she 
called Pierferdinando Casini to attempt a final mediation, in 
order to organize a meeting at the end of the week. Then there 
were Forleo, De Rosa, and the "40." Not to mention Rosy Bindi, 
of course, who remarked "splendid!" to welcome this "act of 
great openness," as she put it, whereby Martinazzoli "is 
confronting the so-called neocentrists with their 
responsibilities." 
  Those who followed the approaching storm with bated breath, 
and who, now that it has broken, are in danger of being 
overwhelmed or swept away by it, are saying nothing for the 
present. Mariotto Segni is saying nothing, having based his 
swing to the center in the summer on the axis with Martinazzoli, 
but who now, with him alone and with Bindi and Mattarella -- 
having already initiated accords with the League and perhaps 
Berlusconi -- can no longer build his Grand Center. And there 
is an anxious silence, too, from the soft underbelly of the DC 
-- the great DC in the South that hates Mastella but does not 
trust Martinazzoli. And that trembles with fear when it sounds 
out its voters. For De Mita, Mancino, and Gargani, any path 
will be a difficult one to take.... 
  On the other side, however, it will take very little to 
prompt Casini and Mastella to resume busy discussions about what 
is to be done. In Bologna, Rome, and Ceppaloni rapid progress 
is being made by the idea of turning the final days under the 
common roof of the DC into days of battle. Francesco D'Onofrio 
issued an immediate response. He admitted right away that 
Tuesday's tour of the seven moderate churches [reference to 
traditional Easter pilgrimage to Rome's seven most important 
churches -- scathingly, a wild-goose chase] was "a deliberately 
provocative initiative, barely legitimate, designed to achieve a 
political clarification." He said "Martinazzoli should have 
conducted these meetings." He harped on the issue on which he 
knows the secretary to be weak, demanding an immediate National 
Council session to establish "who is in the majority and who in 
the minority." 
  The major attacks on the DC came soon after that. The first 
was a document signed by Casini, Mastella, D'Onofrio, Fontana, 
and Fumagalli-Carulli -- that is, the "splittists." It had the 
flavor of a challenge being taken up. We too are "calm," the 
five announced. We too "acknowledge" that the discussion of a 
program with other forces "is becoming for the secretary the 
demonstration of our desire to form another party." Gorrieri 
did not receive such firm treatment, they told the secretary 
sarcastically, "but we are not surprised," because what the DC 
leadership "clearly cannot accept is our idea of creating a 
moderate electoral cartel alternative to Occhetto's." Let us 
convene the National Council, they concluded, and see whether 
the conditions exist for us to cover some ground together or, as 
Martinazzoli says, in order to establish the details with regard 
to the succession to the DC." 
  These are the outlines of an unprecedented political 
challenge -- a door left open to the hope that a spectacular 
internal upheaval could bring the largest sector of the DC to 
occupy the place within the moderate alignment that "we," as 
they put it, "have in any case already firmly occupied." Their 
sights are set mainly on Formigoni and Buttiglione, the 
neo-centrists. That is, on two former CL [Communion and 
Liberation] members who have never severed relations with the 
League, who have never attacked Berlusconi, and who, together 
with Bianco, are attempting a mediation, simultaneously 
condemning the "error" and "imprudence" of Mastella and his 
friends, and Bindi's haste to break away. They are siding, 
albeit cautiously, in favor of a National Council session before 
the "constituent" assembly on 18 January at which the People's 
Party will be established. 
  But this is a very slight hope, little more than a move 
demanded by political protocol. The rest, the real essence of 
the conflict, came in the second attack, in the letter already 
making its way to Martinazzoli's desk, without too much 
publicity. It is a lengthy document in which 35 National 
Council members warn that they are prepared, on the basis of 
party statutes, to convene the Council themselves in order to 
discuss "considerations concerning the continuation or cessation 
of the DC, and the consequences." It carries a postscript that 
constitutes an outright challenge: There must be no changes 
meanwhile to the "name, symbol, and assets of the party." This 
because otherwise the DC's final moments would be lived out in 
still less exalted surroundings -- not only at DC headquarters 
but also in attorney's offices and gloomy courtrooms....

<F P=106> [Interview with Clemente Mastella, Italian Christian </F>
Democratic Party deputy and leader of the neocentrist faction, 
by "S. B." in Rome; date not given: "`But the Party Is Not 
Theirs'" ] 
  [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you sleep well last 
night, Deputy Mastella? 
  [Mastella] Very well. I really do not see why we too should 
not exhibit the serenity always displayed by [Christian 
Democratic Party, DC, Secretary] Martinazzoli. Nobody is Dante 
Alighieri; nobody, not even Martinazzoli, can decide who is to 
be in Paradise, who in Purgatory, and who must be confined to 
hell. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But how do you feel, outside the DC? 
  [Mastella] Outside? Look, let it be clear: We are all in 
the same fold until it is formally decreed that one party is 
finished and another has begun. Today is a day like any other 
day. I am here with many friends from the Campania region. We 
are talking politics and asking questions. [Mastella ends] 
  Clemente Mastella counterattacks: Martinazzoli cannot chase 
anybody away, the "DC still belongs to everybody." He and 
Pierferdinando Casini, the "centrist" leaders, have been a bit 
too busy and the secretary has had enough. They have been 
behaving like a party, they have had political meetings with the 
League.... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What happened? 
  [Mastella] The more I think about it, the more I try to 
understand, the less sense this outburst by the staid 
Martinazzoli makes. At exactly the moment doves of peace were 
flying between us and him and between him and us... Russo 
Jervolino and Mancino, Buttiglione, Formigoni.... When I think 
that two years ago, when Mino announced that he wanted to retire 
at 60, that he wanted to go home and abandon politics, I signed 
a document asking him to stay. I was obviously persuasive, 
because he did stay. In short, how can he think of building the 
new party by starting by throwing out people like us? At any 
rate, I would like to ask him a question.... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Please do. 
  [Mastella] Martinazzoli accuses us of having relations with 
the League. But he does not realize, or he pretends not to 
realize, that people close to him, like Formigoni and 
Buttiglione, say it is necessary to form an alliance with 
Berlusconi and Bossi. In other words, just look at the pulpit 
the sermon of excommunication is coming from! And there is more. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Yes.... 
  [Mastella] Mario Segni is also making overtures to the 
League. So the equation is becoming more and more complex. To 
be consistent, Martinazzoli should say "no" to Segni as well, 
but that is one thing he is steering well clear of. And do you 
know why? Because Segni knows full well that his leadership has 
a meaning only within the framework of an alliance with the 
League; otherwise he will get a majority allowing him to be 
premier in about A.D. 2500. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So? 
  [Mastella] So what we do not accept is that if we say 
something, it is heresy, but if Segni says it, it is fine. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You are also suspected of plotting with 
Fini... 
  [Mastella] I have never said anything about forming an 
alliance with the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. What I have 
said is that "closed-circuit democracy" is over; we should keep 
an eye on the MSI's evolution: If it takes place, then... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So what is it that brought the "centrists" 
together and keeps them together? 
  [Mastella] We simply realized that the new electoral 
mechanism will bring about a bipolar system, so there is a need 
to create two alternative poles. And the People's Party cannot 
fail to be part of the moderate pole. It cannot fail to be 
"modern," as I call it, as opposed to the PDS [Democratic Party 
of the Left] "progressivism." And there is another important 
point: If the People's Party does its job, if it rises to its 
task and the prestige of its role, Silvio Berlusconi will not 
enter the political arena. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Did he tell you that? 
  [Mastella] I have understood it. Besides, it is 
understandable that, if politics plays the absentee, the void 
will be filled by something else authorizing other players to 
maneuver and to fulfill the functions proper to politics. If we 
stay united, this moderate pole can succeed. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But how many of you are there? Have you 
counted? 
  [Mastella] There are very many of us, certainly more than 
the four or five poor fools people would like us to be. And our 
numbers will increase, in the North, the Center, and the South, 
from Campania to Sicily, where we also have electoral weight. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is it true that De Mita, whose right-hand 
man you were until a few years ago, is going to make a political 
comeback? 
  [Mastella] Let him. De Mita certainly does not need my 
authorization. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] To sum up, Deputy Mastella, what is there 
outside Piazza del Gesu [DC headquarters], the desert? 
  [Mastella] Listen, I have spent the day answering calls and 
letters of esteem and solidarity from grass-roots militants, 
from the party rank and file. But also from important leaders, 
all of whom say they are shocked and bewildered. It is a pity 
they do not say so, they do not make public statements to 
proclaim out loud what they tell me over the phone. I repeat: 
Nobody is outside, for the moment we are all in the same fold.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 7 (AFP) -- NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner warned Russia on Friday [7 January] that 
cooperation with the alliance depended on Moscow's full respect 
for human rights and the sovereignty of neighbouring states. 
  "Cooperation is a two-way street," Woerner told a group of 
journalists ahead of next week's North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation summit expected to define the alliance's relations 
with its former Soviet bloc foes. 
  Woerner reiterated that NATO, which has agreed to bolster 
military ties with Russia, was trying to support the democratic 
and economic reform efforts of President Boris Yeltsin. 
  "He knows that, of course, cooperation with the West 
requires 
full respect for not only human rights domestically but also the 
sovereignty and independence of neighbouring states," the NATO 
chief said. 
  Concern about Russia's direction has heightened since the 
suprisingly strong showing by ultra-nationalists in last months' 
parliamentary elections. But NATO analysts said there were 
worrying signs even before. 
  They cited Moscow's insistence on protecting 
Russian-speaking 
minorities abroad, its slowness in withdrawing troops from the 
Baltic states and its drive to become the main peacekeeper in 
the former Soviet republics. 
  Woerner said that while NATO wanted to cooperate with 
Moscow, 
its policy "to a certain extent is influenced by what happens in 
Russia, by the substance and also by the language of those who 
are responsible for policymaking." 
  The summit is expected to adopt a U.S. proposal that would 
offer limited military cooperation with NATO's former Cold War 
enemies but not the automatic promise of alliance membership. 
  Russia is strongly opposed to its one-time satellites 
joining 
NATO. Woerner reiterated that while Moscow would have no veto 
over the alliance's decisions, its interests would have to be 
considered. 
  "We have to satisfy the security needs of the countries of 
Central and East Europe and we have to build a Euro-Atlantic 
Community which does not exclude, but includes Russia," he said. 
  "This can be done in a carefully measured evolution over 
time."

<F P=106> [Report by Brussels correspondent Nikolaos Belos; date not </F>
specified --recorded] 
  [Text] Ioannis Kranidhiotis, Foreign Ministry secretary 
general in charge of European affairs, today outlined the 
priorities and goals of the Greek presidency [of the EC] to the 
European Parliament's Foreign Relations Commission. Mr. 
Kranidhiotis also answered a series of questions from the 
foreign European Parliament deputies. This was the first 
official briefing of the European Parliament on the Greek 
presidency's program. 
  In his address, Mr. Kranidhiotis presented the general 
guidelines of the program on joint foreign policy and security 
of the European Union [EU]. Concerning the Community's 
expansion, Mr. Kranidhiotis stressed that the Greek presidency 
will pursue the conclusion of negotiations with Austria, Sweden, 
Finland, and Norway by 1 March, while also promoting the 
accession of Cyprus and Malta. Referring to the Cyprus issue, he 
noted the important decision by the Council on the appointment 
of an observer, who will be briefing the Council on the 
development of the intercommunal talks in New York. He also 
informed the Commission members that a meeting on the EU-Cyprus 
association will be held in Brussels in May. Mr. Kranidhiotis 
then referred to the EU's joint action in foreign policy issues 
and pointed out that the presidency will primarily deal with 
former Yugoslavia and the effective promotion of humanitarian 
aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He then answered questions from 
foreign Eurodeputies on the situation in Bosnia, the Palestinian 
issue, and Skopje. 
  Responding to a question on Skopje from a Dutch deputy, who 
alleged that Greece has proceeded with a de facto closure of its 
borders with that republic, Mr. Kranidhitios categorically 
denied this allegation, stressing that most of Skopeje's imports 
come through Greece, including 80-85 percent of its oil. 
Concluding this issue, Mr. Kranidhiotis reiterated the 
well-known Greek positions on Skopje and stressed that, in 
addition to the well-known issue of the name, we expect from 
Skopje a series of moves such as the abolition of the Greek 
emblems and the amendment of the preamble to the constitution, 
which implies clear irredentist and expansionist intentions.

<F P=106> [Article by Anneli Sundberg: "Choleric Candidate From </F>
Keminmaa"] 
  [Text] Paavo Vayrynen considers himself persecuted in a 
country of predators and twisted truths. 
  If will alone could determine the outcome of the election, 
Paavo Vayrynen would become president. Vayrynen is trying to get 
to Mantyniemi with frightening fervor. 
  He is trying to force a misguided nation to see matters his 
way. He exhorts people to read books written by him; that is the 
only way to find out the truth about Vayrynen and his political 
platform. At least, the books disclose a master in the art of 
nagging. 
  Who would know Paavo Vayrynen but Paavo Vayrynen himself? As 
a matter of fact, he appears to feel that he is the only one who 
really understands Paavo Vayrynen and knows how to evaluate him 
correctly. 
  The large majority of citizens fear and detest a completely 
wrong image of Vayrynen, a Vayrynen who is the creation of 
baleful publicity, a Vayrynen that does not even exist--in 
Vayrynen's mind. 
  The real Vayrynen can be found in paid ads and in books 
written by Vayrynen. 
  "In my own view, I am just an ordinary Finnish man. I am 
certainly not a saint, nor have I attempted to appear as one. I 
use alcohol the same way as everyone else within the same sphere 
of culture and customs: politicians, business leaders, civil 
servants, and editors. Almost everyone who uses alcohol 
sometimes drinks a little too much. And most Finns use alcohol. 
But I have not pinched any female flight attendants." 
  For an ordinary man, Vayrynen has extraordinarily much to 
explain. 
  Vayrynen must shovel through almost 1,500 pages of sludge in 
order to unearth the real Vayrynen, the fighter, the 
philosopher, and the patriot, whose pure and lofty ideals have 
been dragged through the dirt, and whose character has been 
distorted. 
  So what kind of person is the man on whose head nasty 
publicity has pulled transmogrifying pantyhose, as on a robber? 
  He is choleric. 
  Vayrynen identified his character type as soon as he had 
read 
O. Hallesby's book, Human Character Traits in the Light of 
the Bible. 
  According to Hallesby, individuals of the choleric type are 
strong-willed, determined, energetic, practical leaders, and 
possess common sense. "It is just as if obstacles would double 
such a person's intelligence and energy. His being is then 
certainly suffused by something tense and hard, but he is never 
heard to complain. There is a refreshing and spirited air about 
such a choleric person, something healthy and strong." 
  However, a spirited choleric also has some bad traits. He is 
hard, power-hungry, vengeful, proud, and bursting with 
self-confidence. 
  Vayrynen denies being vengeful. "I am certainly hard when it 
is required, but my nature is still sensitive--even unusually 
sensitive.... After reading Hallesby's book, I have tried to 
train myself," he said . 
  Vayrynen cannot tell when he decided to become a politician. 
"It is as if the positions and the tasks appeared by themselves. 
The road chose me," he explained. 
  The wretched road has had a tough time with its choice. One 
feels sorry for the road, as it could have chosen a much more 
enjoyable traveling companion. Vayrynen alone can fill hundreds 
and hundreds of blank sheets of paper without once erupting in 
relieved laughter. 
<H5>  Smoke and Fire </H5>
  Vayrynen exhibits some kind of wry humor when he describes 
the election campaign in which he was involved in Lapland during 
the 1980's. He finally decided also to capture the votes of the 
athletic public and participated in a 75 km cross-country skiing 
event, with his own election number pinned to his chest. The 
number was in the sequence allotted to competitive skiers, but 
Vayrynen bravely endured all the jeers, as he expected to get 
his picture in the newspaper. Unfortunately, the reporter at the 
scene supported another candidate, and Vayrynen did not receive 
the expected reward. 
  Even the most curmudgeonly sprouting Finnish statesman 
sometimes lets loose among friends and acquaintances, and, for a 
few hours, forgets his political machinations, relaxes, and 
enjoys life. 
  Vayrynen also speaks about his friends, but he appears 
mainly 
to use them as guinea pigs for his political plans. Interaction 
seems to be as enjoyable as loading a rifle. 
  As foreign minister, Vayrynen entertained international 
guests, and, for example, acted as host for his Soviet 
colleague, Andrey Kozyrev, whom he took to Lapland for some 
skiing and relaxation. It is certain that his colleague had a 
good time, as "in front of the fireplace, after supper, among 
other things, I entertained Kozyrev with a detailed account of 
Finland's history." 
  Germany's foreign minister and his wife were also the 
objects 
of Vayrynen's skiing diplomacy. As Vayrynen and guests were 
having supper in a lean-to built by the Finnish Border Guard, 
the wind changed direction and everyone was choked by the smoke. 
"In the future, we must avoid this kind of hospitality," 
writes Vayrynen. 
<H5>  Predators and Carrion Birds </H5>
  Professional advertising people have tried to explain to 
Vayrynen that his best election weapon is his family: his wife 
Vuokko, and his three children, Tiinaliisa, 24, Taneli, 20, and 
Lotta, 16. 
  "I am not going to play this game. My children have a right 
to privacy. Vuokko participates in a manner appropriate in 
Finland, with dignity," said Vayrynen. 
  Vayrynen really does not seem to need to create a political 
profile based on his role as a father and husband. He 
conscientiously lists the misfortunes encountered by his family. 
The house burned down with all the family's possessions. The 
baby died, and his wife's life was also in danger. Lotta broke 
her leg. His mother died. 
  The brief glimpses from his private life drown in the 
endless 
ocean of political setbacks and misunderstandings, and 
ever-surging plans and hopes. Vayrynen suffers, becomes 
disappointed, his wings touch the ground, depression creeps up, 
but he does not give up. He has learned that "even in politics, 
the laws of the jungle apply." 
  "If others think that you are weak, they'll attack you. At 
least the predators will move in on you. If you appear 
sufficiently vulnerable, you will end up being devoured by 
carrion birds," he notes. 
  A proud choleric person would naturally not deign to become 
eaten by ravens. Being the quarry of larger predators is, at 
least, something to be proud about, but Vayrynen seems to be the 
victim of bad luck. The sky may darken with carrion birds, but 
good predators are few and far between. 
  But, so far, there have been enough of them in Vayrynen's 
immediate neighborhood that he can always find opponents larger 
than he. An irresistible force pulls Vayrynen to the top, and he 
spares no effort in his quest for the original source of power. 
  When, after having received a flying start in politics while 
still in his early twenties, Paavo Vayrynen had become 
disappointed with Ahti Karjalainen, who was clearly his senior 
and much more experienced, he decided to establish contact with 
President Urho Kekkonen. 
  The connection was established. 
<H5>  Advice and Criticism </H5>
  Kekkonen felt that Karjalainen was threatening his position 
and took Vayrynen under his wings. 
  Vayrynen became a "teacher's pet" foreign minister and even 
received written instructions on how to act from the president. 
"During the next two to three years (they are the hardest), 
try to act as if you were 10 years older. Walk deliberately, 
with care. Sometimes speak slowly, as the Foreign Ministry is an 
institution steeped in old customs. Dress with careful attention 
to style. I have a bad habit of keeping my hands in my pockets. 
I noted during the trip to the USSR that you too have the same 
problem. Once I observed you saying to good-bye to a fairly 
prominent representative of our hosts by shaking his hand while 
keeping your other hand in your trouser pocket. 
  ``Now is the time for you to stay out of the limelight. Your 
position demands a certain kind of publicity, but you should let 
others worry about domestic matters. You have your hands full 
with your primary duties.'' 
  But Vayrynen, filled with his new importance, did not have 
the patience to wait. 
  Kekkonen became angry and sent a critical card. Vayrynen 
quickly regretted his disobedience and sent a letter. 
  "I got your message last night when I called my wife. And it 
saddened me," he writes. 
  In his letter of atonement, Vayrynen whines over his 
difficulties and asks for understanding. At the end, he gathers 
up his courage and asks for more advice! 
  The still somewhat respectful disciple continues to write to 
Kekkonen. The relentless challenger, who has experienced 
disappointment in his many political hopes, also writes to 
Kekkonen's successor, Mauno Koivisto. 
  "My life in Mauno Koivisto's Finland has not been easy," 
complains Vayrynen. 
<H5>  Distress and Defiance </H5>
  Time after time, Vayrynen bombarded Koivisto with letters; 
he 
complained, ordered, advised, begged, corrected, whined for 
sympathy, and wondered about the poor relationship. Even 
Vayrynen's acquaintances were puzzled with the manic letter 
writing, which Vayrynen unveils in his books. 
  For instance, on Finnish independence day in 1990, Vayrynen 
approached the president. He started by saying: "Again, I spend 
my Independence Day writing you a letter." 
  Vayrynen had returned from Iraq, where a few Finns were kept 
hostage. Ulf Sundqvist, Vayrynen's traveling companion, had 
visited the presidential palace; Vayrynen had not. He felt that 
he had been given the cold shoulder. 
  "I exposed myself to great risks and suffered through a 
difficult journey in order to serve my country. I assumed that 
my troubles would, at least, be rewarded by gratitude from the 
leader of the state. This was not the case. You did not even 
want to see me, and instead, demonstrated your point by inviting 
only my traveling companion. In addition, I was distressed when 
I heard that during my trip, you had criticized me on at least 
two different occasions. 
  ``I intend to continue my political career. If I can attract 
enough support, I intend to occupy some central political 
position. In my view, I do not exaggerate if I say that it is 
not in the country's best interest if we are unable to cooperate 
on a practical level. I believe that I have done my fair share 
in achieving this objective. And I intend to continue in the 
same vein. But at the same time, I hope to receive some kind of 
reciprocity from you.'' 
  The letter was not written by a jilted lover, but by a man 
who at his own initiative was conducting a one-sided 
correspondence with the president, and who, at the time when the 
letter was written, was hardly anything but a rank-and-file 
Eduskunta representative, and whose trip was certainly not the 
president's idea. 
  "In Mauno Koivisto's Finland, my greatest problem has been 
my 
personal relationship with the president," worries Vayrynen. 
  President Mauno Koivisto has been all too conscious of his 
position, to succumb to becoming the executor of Vayrynen's 
wishes. Of course, such a relationship constitutes a problem for 
both parties, as one person has the power and the other one the 
hunger for it. 
<H5>  Dreams and Disappointments </H5>
  To Vayrynen's disappointment, Prime Minister Esko Aho also 
has proven himself to be difficult. After all, he was not 
satisfied with the crumbs from Vayrynen's table. He became 
"Koivisto's faithful factotum," and Vayrynen suspects that he 
has his aim on the presidency. 
  It was probably disconcerting for Vayrynen to discover that 
he has ended up in a similar position as that into which, in the 
past, he drove Ahti Karjalainen. The acolyte tries to surpass 
his master and obeys reluctantly--if at all. 
  In the presidential elections, Vayrynen has chosen Martti 
Ahtisaari as his primary opponent. Vayrynen has also tried to 
challenge heavier fighters and has never stayed in his own 
weight class. 
  Popularity polls do not look too promising for Vayrynen. 
Mantyniemi seems to remain a dream. 
  Vayrynen may end up writing letters to his third president, 
unless we can find something else for him to do. During the last 
years, Vayrynen has been so busy developing his thoughts and 
ideas on the economy that we should perhaps offer him as a 
traveling consultant to, for example, Russia, which has gotten 
its economy into an even greater mess than spunky little Finland 
has. In any case, Finland is an all too insignificant forum for 
the son of the vegetable grower from Keminmaa who in his own 
mind has the formula for the salvation of all of mankind.

  [Text] Schwerin (DDP/ADN) -- According to information in 
the SCHWERINER VOLKSZEITUNG newspaper, the Federal Government 
will continue to arm the Indonesian Navy. Parallel to the 
decision to deliver 39 former warships from the NVA [National 
People's Army of the former GDR] to the highly indebted 
island-state, the Federal Security Council has also approved the 
export of a 209 class submarine. Bonn has also given the green 
light for the options for the construction of two further 
submarines. The article is based on Bonn's response to a 
question from SPD [Social Democratic Party] Bundestag deputies 
on arms deals with Indonesia, the paper writes (Friday [7 
January] edition). 
  The submarines, each of which costs 665.1 million German 
marks [DM], are covered by the Hermes government export credit 
guarantee. At the same time, the Federal Government has 
admitted that, contrary to previous statements, it has only 
partially demilitarized the former NVA ships or has supplied 
them as complete weapons systems to the Indonesian Navy, it is 
further reported. Sixteen "Parchim" ships have thus been handed 
over to the Indonesian Navy in a fully equipped state. The 
delivery of the 39 NVA ships has also been guaranteed to the 
tune of DM689.9 million.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 6 (AFP) -- The UN should resist mounting 
pressure to pull its forces out of war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina, 
French President Francois Mitterrand said Thursday [6 January], 
but he warned the use of force by UN troops in the ex-Yugoslavia 
could deepen the Balkans conflict. 
  But in his traditional New Year's press conference, 
Mitterrand said: "I would not wish to see a withdrawal of the UN 
troops because that would amount to abandoning the civilians 
even more than they are already. 
  "To say to these people, tear yourselves to pieces (...) I 
could not imagine such a thing," said the French leader, who 
paid tribute to UN forces in former Yugoslav state who had 
"sometimes paid with their lives." [passage omitted] 
  Mitterrand backed the use of force to carry out the UN 
mission in Bosnia but said doing so risked "spreading the 
infection of war, little by little," adding that "our policy 
must be sufficiently courageous but also very prudent. 
  "1994 will not go by without some important innovations" in 
policy on Bosnia, he said. 
  The president expressed measured support for a call by 
French 
Defence Minister Francois Leotard for US involvement in the 
conflict, saying "if there was the need for air cover for UN 
soldiers, why not?" 
  In a wide-ranging press conference the French leader 
expressed concern for the rise in Islamic fundamentalism in 
Algeria, a former French colony, saying "we have the right to be 
worried about fundamentalist campaigns." 
  And in a passing reference to his health the 76-year-old 
president, who suffers from prostate cancer, said there was 
"nothing to report."

  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DPA) -- On the eve of the 10 January 
NATO summit in Brussels, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called for 
the East European states to be given clear prospects of 
membership. The justified security needs of Germany's eastern 
neighbors, like Poland and the Czech Republic, needed to be 
taken "very seriously," the Chancellor told FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG. He was also in favor of these countries 
joining the European Union (EU) when they fulfill the economic 
preconditions for doing so. 
  Kohl once again came out in favor of further expanding 
security links between NATO and Russia. Without mentioning the 
name of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the extreme right-wing 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Kohl said the recent "shrill 
extremist noises" from Moscow should not dissuade NATO from 
continuing on this path. On the contrary, they were an 
additional reason to maintain the close relations with 
particular care. He supported the reform politics of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and expected that in the process of 
building a democratic order, "relapses into old thinking" could 
be warded off. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels (DPA) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
pressed for closer political and military cooperation between 
NATO and the reform states of Central and Eastern Europe. Kohl 
told the heads of state and government during the opening of the 
alliance's two-day conference in Brussels today that the 
alliance had to take seriously the "understandable security 
policy concerns" of the states of Central, Eastern, and 
southeastern Europe. The people in these countries currently 
felt they were living in a "gray zone of security." 
  For this reason, NATO's offer of "Partnership for Peace" 
also 
opened up the prospect of joining the Atlantic alliance. Kohl 
stressed, however, that "nobody is able to give a concrete date 
for this at the moment." Training for participation in 
international peace missions could number among the joint 
activities envisaged. 
  Kohl is also prepared to offer the reform states immediate 
consultations if they are faced with a threat. This made clear 
that the offer of a Partnership for Peace was not merely a 
diplomatic cliche, "but a seriously intended step on the path 
toward later membership," Kohl said. 
  No new rifts should be created in Europe. A relationship 
based on partnership had to be developed with Russia and 
Ukraine. Policies of partnership, responsibility, and 
constructive involvement in international problems were expected 
from the Russian side. Attempts at hegemony could not be 
reconciled with these expectations, Kohl said.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA)--In the run-up to the NATO summit in 
Brussels, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping has warned against 
accepting the eastern European countries into the western 
alliance too quickly. Scharping told the BILD newspaper (Monday 
[10 January] edition): "The legitimate security interests of 
Russia and the other CIS states have to be considered in this. 
We must not give the nationalist, partly fascist, in any case 
antiwestern and anti democratic forces in Russia any cheap 
excuses. So this has to be a process of several stages that 
must not ignore the economic side of things, in particular." 
  The SPD leader also stressed that the Central and East 
European states' fear of "being under Moscow's control again" 
had to be taken seriously. It was therefore "sensible to use 
existing instruments -- NATO and CSCE -- to give states such as 
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, possibly also Slovakia and 
others, security prospects." The SPD chairman stressed, 
however, that Russian membership of NATO was "unrealistic from 
today's point of view." (This report was prereleased to DPA in

  [Text] Frankfurt (DPA) -- To prevent Europe from splitting 
once again, Russia has proposed a new "strategy of partnership" 
to the West and other European states. In a signed article for 
the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU (Saturday's [8 January] edition), 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev warns against 
"fragmentation tendencies" in Europe. 
  If NATO expands towards the east "over-hastily," a dangerous 
situation will arise in Europe -- like the one that arose from 
the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. Kozyrev said that 
admitting Poland or other Central and East European states to 
NATO would mean shifting the "guardhouse on the Rhine" to the 
"banks of the Bug." 
  The core of the Russian proposal was the idea of taking all 
steps towards a "new European architecture" on a joint, equal 
basis. Regional organizations such as the EU [European Union], 
NATO, or the WEU [Western European Union] had to be open to all 
democratic countries. Even Russia did not rule out a priori 
that it could apply for admission to NATO at some stage in the 
future, Kozyrev announced. 
  Kozyrev says that the "guarantee of the same security level 
for all European states" and the "exclusion of territorial 
claims" were among the principles of the partnership strategy 
proposed by him. The Russian Government's specific proposal was 
that the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, in which all NATO 
and former Warsaw Pact countries are represented, should be made 
into a central organization for military cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RAY: "General Briquemont Says his </F>
Decision Was Made Out of `Weariness'"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Zagreb, Brussels, 5 Jan (BELGA) -- On Wednesday [5 
January], Lieutenant General Francis Briquemont justified his 
request to be relieved as the commander of the UN Protection 
Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying that he was "weary" of the 
ill will shown by the Bosnian belligerants. 
  "I feel that here in Sarajevo a mandate of six or seven 
months is enough. I can see that everyone who leaves Sarajevo 
after six months is tired, and I am not ashamed to say that I am 
feeling a certain amount of fatigue. I am not distressed, but 
this weariness is undoubtedly the result of many factors. That 
is the only reason," he affirmed during a telephone interview 
given to RTBF Television from Zagreb. 
  "The weariness is the result of these constantly repeated 
efforts. We constantly discuss the same problems; and we 
constantly run up against the same difficulties. There is no 
goodwill shown by the parties involved. I have always said that 
I was not pessimistic, but I think I can also say that I am not 
optimistic either," he added. 
  When asked about the advice he would give to his successor, 
the Belgian officer said that he would give "the same advice 
that French Gen. Philippe Morillon (his predecessor -- BELGA 
editor's note) gave me: `Be terribly patient.'" 
  "I would also give him another piece of advice, which would 
be to remind the politicians in charge of the difficulties in 
which they are putting us constantly, because there is no 
coherence in their strategy," he said. 
  Gen. Briquemont also played down the difficulties he 
encountered with the United Nations. 
  "I will tell you that the problem with the United Nations is 
a secondary problem. I believe that, together with Gen. Jean 
Cot (the commander of all UN forces in the former Yugoslavia), 
we expressed what we thought. When one is in such an 
inextricable situation and one is responsible for the lives of 
thousands of people, I feel that it is not just a right for the 
generals to say what they think but also a duty," he continued. 
  By the end of the month Gen. Briquemont is to be replaced as 
the head of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia by 
British officer Gen. Michael Rose.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- Germany and Norway insist that 
Russia stop dumping nuclear waste in the North Sea and other 
marine sites. This was made clear in Bonn today by Environment 
Ministers Klaus Toepfer and Thorbjoern Berntsen. Toepfer drew 
attention to a statement by Moscow that Russia will have to 
continue sea-dumping liquid waste from nuclear plants until 1995 
if Western help with disposal is not provided. By 1995, 
activities of a Russian processing plant near the Barents Sea 
pose a particular threat, Berntsen said. 
  According to the ministers, both countries are prepared to 
help Russia within the scope of the G24 countries' aid program. 
However, Toepfer says the precondition for this is for the 
Russian side to undertake a binding program on disposal 
measures. He implied that concrete assistance has so far failed 
because of this. Russia intends to submit a technical program 
for nuclear waste disposal, including costs, by 1 February. 
  As concluded by two Norwegian-Russian expeditions, which 
assessed risks in the North Sea and included a German scientist, 
Toepfer said another reconnaissance trip by a German ship should 
take place this year. It is of vital importance "that we make 
progress here." Areas posing a particular threat are the 
reactors from spent nuclear submarines dumped in the North Sea 
by the former Soviet Union. 
  Other topics covered at the start of the two-day visit to 
Germany by his Norwegian counterpart were Oslo's negotiations 
for European Union [EU] membership, the disputed issue of 
whaling, and the support signalled by Toepfer for Berntsen's 
candidacy for chairmanship of the UN Commission for Sustainable 
Development, which will be decided in May. 
  Norway's membership in the EU membership -- which is the 
second attempt to join after the people voted against such a 
move in 1972 -- is viewed by Toepfer as important, not least for 
environmental reasons: "Norway has high standards in the 
environmental sphere." This could encourage other EU countries, 
Toepfer said. Whereas Toepfer assumes that Norway will be an EU 
member from 1 January 1995, Berntsen did not wish to rule out 
entirely the possibility that his fellow countrymen might once 
again vote against this in a referendum. His government would 
regret this, he said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report from John Carvel in Brussels: "EU Prepares To </F>
Counter Espionage"] 
  [Text] Senior Eurocrats are preparing defences against 
espionage in European Union [EU] institutions now that their 
activities have been expanded into sensitive areas of foreign 
policy and counterterrorism. 
  Positive vetting of key personnel is being set up for the 
first time in the secretariat of the Council of Ministers in 
Brussels. The Commission is extending arrangements originally 
designed to protect Euratom nuclear secrets. 
  The moves were disclosed in a letter from Niels Ersboll, 
secretary-general of the Council of Ministers, to Alex Falconer, 
Labour MEP [Member of European Parliament] for Mid Scotland and 
Fife, who led the European Parliament's successful campaign to 
fight previous attempts to instigate official secrecy in the 
Community. 
  "Given its responsibility under the new treaty (of 
Maastricht), the Council secretariat will have to deal with 
certain classified information (e.g. information relating to the 
security policy of member states or information on terrorist 
threat) which, as you will understand, necessitates special 
precautions to ensure confidentiality and avoid unauthorised 
disclosure of material which would seriously damage the security 
and interests of member states and their citizens," Mr Ersboll 
said. 
  A small number of staff would be "required to undergo the 
security screening which will form part of the proposed security 
regime." 
  A senior Council official said that positive vetting would 
only apply to staff who were given access to sensitive 
documents, including security analyses and comments by member 
states' diplomatic services on foreign governments. 
  The vetting will be carried out by the security services of 
the individual's own member state or, in the case of foreigners 
living in Belgium, by Belgian authorities. 
  "The European Union does not itself have the services which 
could handle these matters. We are very much in the hands of 
the national capitals. They will have to take care of their own 
nationals," he said. 
  The Commission is understood to be preparing to increase the 
number of offlcials who must be positively vetted before they 
can work on the more sensitive parts of common foreign and 
security policy, justice and home affairs -- the second and 
third pillars of the EU agreed at Maastricht. Hitherto, only a 
handful of Commission officials have required positive vetting 
by MI5 or other national security services. Routine checks are 
carried out at recruitment to ensure that staff have no police 
record. But security clearance was only needed for staff with 
access to Euratom secrets and a few other sensitive documents. 
  The Commission's Security Office can handle threats to the 
personal safety of commissioners and visiting dignitaries. It 
also co-operates with national security services when espionage 
charges are made against staff -- such as the current inquiry 
into the alleged Stasi connections of a German official in the 
Overseas Development Directorate. To add to German 
embarrassment, it was revealed yesterday that its ambassador to 
Gabon, Rainer Muller, has been arrested as a suspected Stasi spy. 
  Mr Falconer said he was concerned that a special cadre of 
vetted officials was being set up without reference to the 
European Parliament, which threw out the Commission's previous 
proposals for security vetting of staff. 
  In 1992 the Commission called for an official secrecy regime 
which would have classified its documents "top secret," "secret" 
and "classified," according to their sensitivity. It was forced 
to drop the idea by criticism from the MEPs. 
  Mr Ersboll's letter said the new scheme was much more 
limited 
in scope. Mr Falconer warned that he could find himself in 
conflict with parliament if he did not come clean about what was 
being done.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Home Office: "New Agreement </F>
Extends the Single Market Area"] 
  [Text] 30 Dec 1993 -- Nationals of five countries outside 
the EC will be able to live and work in the United Kingdom and 
other EC member states as the result of an agreement which comes 
into force on 1 January 1994. 
  The European Economic Area Agreement [EEA] will extend the 
free movement provisions of the EC's Single Market to Austria, 
Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. 
  The agreement gives reciprocal rights of movement, residence 
and employment to UK citizens and nationals of other member EC 
States. The expanded single market area will lead to increased 
trade and business opportunities for all parties to the 
agreement. 
<H5>  Home Office Minister Charles Wardle Said Today: </H5>
  "The EEA will extend the existing European Community rights 
of free movement and residence to Austria, Finland, Iceland, 
Norway and Sweden. 
  "This means that nationals of these countries in the future 
will be treated in the same way as European Community nationals 
for immigration purposes. They will be able to enter the United 
Kingdom simply on production of a valid passport or national 
identity card and will be free to work here or, so long as they 
are able to support themselves financially to reside here as a 
student, retired person or in any other capacity. 
  "At ports and airports where there are separate "EC" and 
"non-EC" channels for arriving passengers, EEA nationals will 
now be routed through the EC channel. 
  "The European Economic Area Agreement provides new 
opportunities for United Kingdom companies by extending the 
Single Market to these five countries. In addition the rights of 
free movement and residence will allow British citizens to work 
and carry out business and to reside freely in any of these 
countries in accordance with Community law." 
  The European Economic Area Agreement was signed in Oporto on 
2 May 1993. The United Kingdom ratified the agreement on 15 
November 1993. Full ratification came on 10 December 1993.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of Trade and </F>
Industry on 30 December: "Needham Welcomes Opening of European 
Economic Area"] 
  [Text] The European Economic Area [EEA] Agreement comes 
into force on 1 January 1994 bringing new export opportunities 
for UK companies. It will extend the EC's Single Market to 
Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, members of the 
European Free Trade Association [EFTA]. 
<H3>  Richard Needham, Minister for Trade, Welcomed the Launch of 
the EEA </H3>
  "The EEA will bring new export opportunities for UK 
companies. The EEA covers 17 countries extending from the Arctic 
to the Mediterranean. It removes single market nontariff 
barriers, such as national standards, for businesses selling to 
some 370 million consumers, in an area representing 40 percent 
of the world's trade. 
  Although not a Customs Union, the EEA will provide for free 
movement of goods, services, capital and people. By taking on 
1,500 of the EC's single market measures, the EFTA states will 
have to open areas of their markets previously closed to UK 
exporters. For example: 

  -  Public purchasing contracts will 
have to be open to our companies; 
  -  Many of EFTA's technical 
standards for products will have to be aligned with those set by 
the EC; 
  -  The EFTA states will be subject to rules on competition 
and state aid based on the Community's rules; 
  -  Financial services 
markets will be opened up giving UK firms greater freedom to 
open branches in EFTA states; 
  -  UK professionals will be able to 
practice in the EFTA states without the need to requalify; 
  -  UK 
companies will benefit from EFTA co-operation in EC programmes 
on R&amp;D, education, youth and training, small- and 
medium-sized 
enterprises, tourism and audiovisual services. 
  "UK companies are well placed to take advantage of the 
Agreement. In 1992 we made 5.7 billion pounds of visible exports 
to the EFTA states that will participate in the EEA. The 
Agreement will enable UK business to build on that excellent 
performance." 
<H5>  Notes for Editors </H5>
  1. The European Economic Area Agreement was signed in Oporto 
on 2 May 1992. Entry into force had to await ratification of the 
Agreement by all the participating EC and EFTA states. The last 
states to ratify, France and Spain, did so on 10 December 1993. 
  2. Switzerland, also an EFTA member, decided in a referendum 
in December 1992 not to participate in the EEA. The need to 
amend the Agreement to exclude Switzerland [in a Protocol signed 
on 17 March 1993] delayed the original target date for entry 
into force (1 January 1993). Liechtenstein will join the EEA at 
a date after 1 January 1994 yet to be decided, due to the need 
to make special arrangements arising from its close trading ties 
with Switzerland [with which it has a customs union]. 
  3. The UK ratified the EEA on 15 November 1993. The 
Agreement 
will be implemented in the UK by the European Economic Area Act 
1993. 
  4. Since the EEA Agreement was signed, negotiations on full 
EU [European Union] membership have started with four of the 
participating EFTA states -- Austria, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden. The Edinburgh European Council set a target for the 
entry of these four applicants into the EU by 1 January 1995.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Better News for Eastern Europe"] </F>
  [Text] A reaffirmation of the United States' commitment to 
Europe has been overdue for some time. Al Gore, the Vice 
President, provided it last night in a speech setting the scene 
for next week's NATO summit. 
  The speech is welcome not only because Europeans want 
reassurance, but also because the United States seems to need 
periodic reminders of the importance of Europe for its own 
interests and its own security, no matter how vital the Pacific 
rim is as well. It should not have taken Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
to provoke such a reminder. 
  But this time Mr Gore also reached out to include the 
democracies of East Europe, not with a full commitment to their 
security but to emphasise that "the security of these states 
affects the security of America." This, too, was necessary. It 
is simple enough to understand why Washington has been reluctant 
to invite East Europe fully into NATO. Not only would an 
invitation risk provoking the nationalists in Russia, but it 
would also commit NATO to the defence of a much enlarged area 
before the political and military groundwork has been done. 
  Yet the reluctance has been overdone to the extent of 
seeming 
to give Moscow a veto over Western security policy. As a 
result, the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians, in particular, have 
felt themselves abandoned in a security vacuum by a Western 
alliance that is supposed to share their values and interests. 
They have rightly felt aggrieved and vulnerable and have been 
pressing for more supportive policies, especially since the 
nationalist clouds gathered in Moscow. 
  Washington's much-touted "Partnership for Peace" was 
supposed 
to reassure the East Europeans without provoking Moscow but has 
satisfied neither. Mr Gore's speech, coupled with an 
authoritative briefing from NATO sources, changes the emphasis 
rather than the substance of policy. East Europe now gets more 
attention and better hopes of entering NATO at some point, while 
the Russian veto looks weaker. This is entirely right, provided 
it is coupled, as it is likely to be, with efforts to persuade 
the Russians that they are not being excluded from Europe. 
  What they need to be shown is that it is up to them whether 
their relationship with Europe is to be co-operative or 
confrontational. Western reassurance for East Europe does not 
threaten them; rather, it lowers the risk of instability in the 
area, which should be to Russia's advantage. If the NATO 
summit is now freed of an exaggerated deference to the more 
irrational fears of Moscow, its chances of success will be 
enhanced.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Shoulder to the Wheel. Clinton Draws Closer </F>
to Europe"] 
  [Text] When President Clinton comes to Europe next week to 
attend the NATO summit he is not going to offer much 
satisfaction to the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians who are 
knocking at the doors of NATO and demanding protection from a 
possible resurgence of imperialism in Russia. But, to judge by 
yesterday's major foreign policy speech in Milwaukee, delivered 
by Vice President Al Gore because of the death of Mr Clinton's 
mother, the President seems to have learnt a lot about the 
dangers and challenges facing Europe -- and the importance of 
facing them if America is to remain prosperous and secure. 
  In his ideas, if not yet in his actions, Mr Clinton clearly 
wants his visit to Europe to mark a clean break from last summer 
when Warren Christopher, his Secretary of State, could dismiss 
the war in Bosnia as "a humanitarian crisis a long way from home 
in the middle of another continent." 
  Europe's central importance for America was certainly the 
welcome message yesterday from Milwaukee. "Nothing is more 
important than our relationship with Europe," declared Mr 
Clinton. But what was more convincing, and potentially 
significant, was his ability to justify this airy statement to a 
domestic American audience which still shows every sign of 
wanting to turn its back on the outside world. Predictably Mr 
Clinton explained that Europe was an "invaluable trading 
partner" and a market for exports. It was also a possible 
source of security threats and global instability and therefore 
a potential drain on American government finances. But Mr 
Clinton went beyond these cliches to emphasise a more 
intangible, and even more important, feature of America's 
relationship with Europe: a feature which lies at the heart of 
the challenge for Europe and explains why the Atlantic will 
always be more important to America than the Pacific, regardless 
of the future flows of trade and the balance of world economic 
growth. 
  What Europe now needed above all else, said Mr Clinton, was 
a 
new form of protection, built not on walls and barbed wire, but 
on free commerce, democracy and respect for human diversity and 
political dissent. After the decades of Communist uniformity 
and repression, Europeans had rediscovered their ethnic and 
religious differences. They now had to transform Europe's 
diversity from a source of conflict into its great strength. 
America's indispensable contribution was to show through its 
own historical experience that it was possible "to build a 
shared civic space large enough for all our differences." But 
this ideal of a civic society, embracing diversity instead of 
suppressing dissent, was not an American creation. It was 
actually an import by Jefferson from European liberal 
philosophy. And that philosophy not only underlies the American 
Constitution; it also ultimately made inevitable America's 
reluctant involvement in the two world wars. 
  It is because America shares its fundamental political 
philosophy with West Europe that so much of 20th-century history 
has revolved around the Atlantic alliance. And as Mr Clinton 
correctly asserted, the greatest challenge facing America, as 
well as West Europe, in the coming years, is to ensure that the 
politics of Central Europe and the former Soviet Union are cast 
irreversibly into the same liberal mould. Mr Clinton may not 
yet know how to complete this historic task. But at least, as 
he said in Milwaukee, he is finally willing "to put America's 
shoulder to the wheel."

<F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal </F>
United Services Institute, London: "It's Foreign Policy, 
Stupid!"] 
  [Text] If Washington's claims are to be believed, 1994 
will be the year of Europe. Apart from Monday's [10 January] 
NATO summit, President Bill Clinton plans three further European 
forays in the next 12 months. Yet the frequency with which the 
White House reminds the Europeans about the President's many 
coming engagements is a sure sign of transatlantic problems. 
  The Administration claims that, despite all the criticism, 
its foreign policy remains a success. Washington is now at the 
forefront of efforts to reform the NATO alliance and its 
unstinting support for Russia's reforms is bearing fruit. In 
fact, the last year has been marked by a litany of errors and 
badly executed policies which have only increased the Europeans' 
doubts about the Administration's competence. 
  A president elected on the slogan "It's the economy, 
stupid!" 
displayed little interest in foreign matters and an alarming 
capacity to giggle every time he answered foreign policy 
questions. Ronald Reagan was hardly an intellectual giant, but 
he compensated for his deficiencies by choosing the right people 
for the appropriate slots. Not so with Mr Clinton. For months 
on end, the Administration did not fill the middle-level 
positions in the State Department, and those expected to run 
foreign and security policies assumed that they were still on 
the university benches. Hefty documents poured out of the White 
House, all advocating "engagement" or the "enlargement of 
democracy." Beautifully crafted, they nevertheless remained 
irrelevant: abstract notions intended to paper over confusion 
and weak personalities. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
remains the lawyer he always was: good with a client's brief; 
useless without one. 
  Most of the animosity generated in transatlantic relations 
remains of the worst kind: carelessness born out of sloppiness. 
Mr Christopher's remarks last November that America's policies 
have been unduly Eurocentric and need to be redirected towards 
Asia was followed by a flood of statistics on trade, all 
supposedly indicating that, at least in economic terms, Europe's 
importance is eclipsed by the potential of the Pacific "tigers." 
While it is true that America trades more with Asia than with 
Europe, the same applies to the European Union, which exported 
goods worth $73 billion to Asia last year, compared with only 
$67 billion to the United States. Constructing a new security 
pecking order out of this is childish and counterproductive. 
  Furthermore, co-ordination on foreign policy with the 
Europeans continues to be appalling. The Germans, for instance, 
who sent troops to Somalia after a long and anguished debate at 
home, learnt of Mr Clinton's decision to withdraw U.S. soldiers 
from the area not in a diplomatic communication but from the 
media. Careless talk, coupled with sudden shifts: Mr Clinton 
and his foreign policy advisers have given the concept of 
megaphone diplomacy a new meaning. 
  Washington's dispute with the Europeans over the handling of 
the Yugoslav war is another example of misunderstandings. Like 
the Europeans, Mr Clinton thought that the Balkans civil war 
challenged basic security principles. But, like the Europeans, 
he wished to see someone else's soldiers punish the Serbs. One 
moment the Administration swore it would not tolerate any 
further outrages; the next day its officials asserted that 
Bosnia was not, after all, America's concern. The result was 
the worst of both worlds. 
  Insisting on the principle that aggression must not be 
allowed to succeed, Washington scuppered two peace plans for 
Yugoslavia but offered no viable alternative apart from the 
traditional drop of food parcels intended to expiate everyone's 
consciences. An offer of peacekeeping forces was quietly 
withdrawn, but this did not prevent the Administration from 
unleashing a barrage of accusations against spineless Europeans, 
supposedly unable to "solve" conflicts in their own backyard. 
Have the Americans done better in their own vicinity, in places 
such as Cuba, Haiti, or much of Latin America? The dispute over 
Yugoslavia would have been entirely avoidable if Mr Clinton had 
understood that, the moment he ruled out the introduction of 
American ground forces in the Balkans, he also forfeited the 
right to lead the West in that conflict. 
  Yet there is a more fundamental problem with Mr Clinton's 
European policy which the tussle over Yugoslavia also exposed. 
Americans respond well to grand visions and clearly defined 
dangers, such as those prevailing during the Cold War. The 
U.S., however, is ill-equipped to deal with the much more 
ambiguous challenges of today's Europe. For a country created 
by people who chose to leave their nationalism behind, ethnic 
and territorial disputes are regarded as diseases of the past, 
problems artificially encouraged by unscrupulous leaders. 
Remove Slobodan Milosevic and people in Yugoslavia would live 
happily ever after; support Boris Yeltsin and all will be well. 
The search for simple solutions for Europe's complex problems 
is an old American trait. Current American policies reveal the 
same mixture of New World idealism and detachment from realities. 
  Mr Clinton's proposal for the reform of NATO is appealing 
-- on the surface. The countries of East Europe cannot join the 
alliance immediately: the proposed Partnership for Peace 
programme neither promises nor precludes future membership, but 
offers all former Communist states time to accustom themselves 
to military cooperation with the West. Yet, far from avoiding a 
new division of Europe, as Washington likes to claim, the plan 
simply maintains the old East-West division, the lowest common 
denominator on which all NATO partners can agree. 
  But the problem with the Partnership for Peace goes much 
deeper. The U.S. Administration assumes that it could dictate 
the pace of change in NATO, carefully calibrating its interests 
against commitments. Far from it. Washington or London may 
have the luxury of musing about the future, but Germany, as the 
frontline state most exposed to potential trouble from the East, 
does not. 
  Either NATO tackles these problems collectively, or it will 
become irrelevant for the most important European member, 
Germany. By refusing to understand this, the Americans may be 
forfeiting their ability to influence European events for a long 
time to come. 
  Leaving the East Europeans in suspended animation will bring 
no security to either Russia or the West. Without a firm 
anchoring in NATO, the region will only descend into turmoil and 
a competition for spheres of influence. The Americans have an 
opportunity to fashion Europe's new security structure, but seem 
unable to seize it. 
  Having announced his Partnership for Peace without 
consulting 
anyone, Mr Clinton is now reduced to hoping that the East 
Europeans will accept this paper exercise, thereby sparing his 
embarrassment. But it is curious that a plan intended to solve 
the security problems of the region is mistrusted by precisely 
the people who are expected to benefit from it. Partnership for 
Peace will achieve only a brief postponement of Europe's real 
security debate. 
  Yet everything pales into insignificance compared with 
Washington's relations with Russia. Its single-minded obsession 
with supporting Mr Yeltsin is not a policy but a religion, faith 
that Russia will become a democracy, because it must become a 
democracy. Having spent 40 years confronting a strong Soviet 
Union, America is now concentrating on appeasing a weak Russia. 
The Russian economy is collapsing not because it was subjected 
to shock therapy, but because it was exposed to little real 
economic change. Now, though, the U.S. is counselling a 
slowdown in the pace of economic reform, and blames 
international financial institutions for failing to help. But it 
was Washington which first insisted on strict aid conditions, 
and it was the White House which limited the powers of the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to extend aid 
according to political rather than purely financial 
considerations. 
  Moreover, America's concentration on limiting the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons, the only systems that can hit 
the U.S. directly, has succeeded only in alienating Ukraine. 
What would the U.S. do if, after giving up its nuclear arsenal, 
Ukraine were destabilised from within by the same techniques 
Russia has already employed in the Caucasian republics and 
Central Asia? Send Secretary of State Warren Christopher on a 
"goodwill" mission or convene a solemn meeting of the 
Partnership for Peace? A policy which consistently views Russia 
as the central interlocutor and conveniently ignores Mr 
Yeltsin's ever-growing demands for a sphere of influence 
throughout the former Soviet empire will lead to disaster. 
  To be sure, confusion about foreign policy is not confined 
to 
the United States. But the U.S. is not just any state; 
leadership of the West carries special responsibilities and a 
high price. By seeking to conduct a foreign policy on the 
cheap, by doggedly upholding the rosiest of scenarios about the 
future of Russia, Mr Clinton's policies may end in catastrophe. 
The chances are that the biggest question this "domestic" 
president will face in his next electoral campaign will be "Who 
lost Europe?" East and West. By then, something considerably 
more than giggles will be required.

<F P=106> [Article by Conor Cruise O'Brien: "Quit Now We're Ahead? </F>
No Way"] 
  [Text] We are being told that the IRA is under heavy 
pressure to deliver peace. Some even hold that it is about to 
split under this terrible strain. Don't believe a word of it! 
The morale of Sinn Fein-IRA -- one organization, not two -- is 
far higher now than it was at the beginning of last year. And 
the main reason for this is the Downing Street declaration of 15 
December 1993. 
  The IRISH TIMES has a Northern reporter who has the entree 
to 
the appropriate circles. Her name is Suzanne Breen, and she was 
among the guests at Sinn Fein's Christmas party, right after the 
publication of the Declaration, and after the IRA's immediate 
and derisory response, which took the form of announcing its 
customary three-day Christmas truce. Gerry Adams in person 
presided over the festivities of his followers and friends. 
  Were the assembled Sinn Feiners cast down at the IRA's 
rebuff 
to the declaration which their President had done so much to 
shape? They were not. The general mood was one of unalloyed 
euphoria. They were delighted with the declaration -- which they 
felt was a coup on their own part -- but they were also entirely 
supportive of the IRA's "no hurry, let's see" response. 
Implicitly, but unmistakenly [as published], they support the 
continuation of the violence. 
  But why should Sinn Fein-IRA be so pleased with the Downing 
Street declaration? The reason is that it contains one sentence 
included at its behest, in an attempt to appease them, as they 
well know. And this sentence, with other matter related to it, 
constitutes the only really new element in the declaration. The 
sentence runs: 
  "The British Government agrees that it is for the people of 
the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts 
respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on 
the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and 
South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish." 
  No previous British Government has ever agreed to any 
proposition of that order. Obviously, it does not yet represent 
everything Sinn Fein-IRA is looking for. It includes the 
principle of consent -- meaning Unionist consent -- and it makes 
no change in the legal status quo. For those reasons (and 
because they were consulted in advance, and because they have 
nothing to hope for from the Opposition at Westminster) the 
response of the Official Unionists to the declaration has been 
calm and measured. Middle-class Unionists tend to be legalistic 
in their approach to documents. But Sinn Fein-IRA looks at 
documents in terms of symbols and signals: especially those 
which suggest who is winning the battle of wills. That 
sentence, issued officially on behalf of the British Government, 
conveys to them the message that the IRA is winning. Hence the 
euphoria. 
  The general pattern of Sinn Fein-IRA's responses over this 
year is predictable. There will not be the "permanent end to 
the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence" which the two 
governments have been looking for and still pretend may be round 
the corner. Sinn Fein-IRA will seek further concessions, in the 
form of "clarifications." Indeed, the clarification game is 
already in full swing. John Hume has called for clarifications 
to be provided by the British and Irish Governments for both 
Sinn Fein and the Rev Ian Paisley's party (a recipe for 
diplomatic bedlam). Gerry Adams has backed Mr Hume's demands, 
adding for good measure that Mr Major's failure to date to 
provide the necessary clarifications is "childish" and "grossly 
irresponsible." The IRA will measure its continuing dosage of 
violence in proportion to the responses to the demands for 
clarification. 
  There are likely to be tactical cease-fires, and when these 
break down the blame will be cast on the intransigence of the 
Unionists, the perfidy of the British Government, and the 
treachery of the Irish one. Even at this stage, the most 
congenial of these themes is being addressed. Mr Hume this week 
charged that Mr Molyneaux "does not want the IRA campaign to 
stop and is provoking them into continuing." So if the IRA 
campaign does continue, it will be the Unionists and not the IRA 
who are responsible, in Mr Hume's eyes. In short, Sinn Fein-IRA 
and its friends have already begun an enjoyable game of 
cat-and-mouse with the two governments, and with the longing for 
peace of a gullible public in both islands. 
  It is not Sinn Fein-IRA that is under pressure. It is Sinn 
Fein-IRA that is applying -- and occasionally relaxing -- the 
pressure, in a highly sophisticated manner. Those who believe 
the group to be under pressure, because of the general longing 
for peace, are utterly mistaken. For terrorists, a general 
longing for peace does not constitute a threat. On the 
contrary, it is an asset, a major resource, that they exploit at 
will: "You want peace, do you? Well, we control the supply of 
that commodity. How much will you pay us, politically, to let 
you have a bit of peace, for a while?" 
  The brutal fact is that the two governments, and Mr Hume, 
were conned by Sinn Fein into issuing a declaration that 
benefits nobody except Sinn Fein's masters, the IRA. The 
governments and Mr Hume were led to believe that the IRA was so 
war-weary that all it wanted was some formula with the magic 
word "self-determination" in it, to save its face, and then it 
would give up the fight, for good. Mr Reynolds, it seems, was 
assured of this by some monks he met in the border area, and the 
diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by Mr Hume. Mr Major 
appears to have experienced similar revelations. It was all a 
put-up job. The alleged war weariness was never more than a 
ploy. Those who fell for it cannot admit the fact, even to 
themselves, so the ploy is still working. 
  One should not despair. Sinn Fein-IRA may overplay its hand, 
and the two governments may recover their nerve, or acquire 
some. The only road that can lead to lasting peace is the hard 
road of fighting the IRA instead of appeasing it. And that will 
require internment, evenhandedly applied to both sets of 
paramilitary godfathers. That road may yet be tried. But the 
omens for it being tried at any time this year look far from 
good.

<F P=106> [Alan Murdoch report from Dublin: "British Approach Worries </F>
Dublin"] 
  [Text] The Irish Government is concerned that heavy-handed 
British interventions could alienate Republican opinion, when 
delicate persuasion could still draw Sinn Fein and the IRA into 
the peace process. 
  Sources in Dublin expressed fears that recent statements 
from 
the Prime Minister and Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, 
warning of limited British patience over the Downing Street 
declaration, could be counterproductive. "The British could be 
more positive," one said. 
  Sinn Fein and the IRA are seeking clarification only on the 
political implications of the Downing Street declaration, and 
are not seeking textual changes in the document itself, Dublin 
has been advised. 
  The Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, is concerned that John Major 
is not making enough effort to sell the document to Nationalists 
and Republicans, relying too much on threats. 
  This partly underlay Mr Reynolds' remarks this week about 
the 
importance of "demilitarising" the Northern Ireland situation. 
  This was a calculated attempt to ease concerns about 
Britain's future role voiced by the senior Sinn Fein figure 
Martin McGuinness last weekend. 
  While deploring the violence of the Provisionals, Dublin 
believes that if the peace effort is to bear fruit, a degree of 
respect must be shown by both governments to Sinn Fein's process 
of deliberation, given its entrenched political perspective. 
  The lack of direct information since the lines of 
communication between the Republican movement and London became 
public last November has exacerbated the Provisionals' unease 
about British intentions. 
  Dublin has opened the door to a political role for Sinn Fein 
in a forum for peace and reconciliation with other Irish parties 
after an IRA cease-fire. But Republicans want to know more 
about what political process is envisaged by Britain. 
  The Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, is this week writing 
to 
Mr Major mapping out areas where his party wants clarification.

  [Text] Wildbad Kreuth (DPA) -- For the first time, the 
president of the Federal Constitutional Court, Roman Herzog, has 
publicly declared his willingness to stand as a candidate for 
the office of president. Herzog said today, at the closed 
meeting of the CSU [Christian Social Union], that he was a 
candidate like the others. Herzog apparently intends to announce 
his candidacy at the assembly on 23 May even without the 
agreement of the FDP [Free Democratic Party]: "I do not claim 
to be a de luxe candidate." 
  Prior to the meeting, the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] 
and CSU leaders, Helmut Kohl and Theo Waigel, had agreed on 
Herzog as the successor to Richard von Weizsaecker. Finance 
Minister Waigel said after a telephone conversation with Kohl at 
the start of the Land CSU closed meeting: "It is clear who the 
CDU/CSU nominee will be." 
  Waigel called on the FDP to withdraw their candidate, 
Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. Herzog would have to be nominated by 
the coalition. With his independence, poise, and political 
experience, the Federal Constitutional Court judge was best 
qualified: "There could be no better candidate."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Napolitano Meets Balladur on </F>
European, Italian Issues"] 
  [Text] Paris, 6 Jan (ANSA) -- The enlargement of the 
European Union, relations with Russia and NATO's function were 
discussed here today at a meeting between French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur and Italian Lower House Speaker Giorgio 
Napolitano, but Napolitano said he also brought the premier up 
to date on evolutions in the Italian political situation. 
  "France is following attentively the delicate moment of 
transition and change Italy is passing through," Napolitano told 
ANSA after the meeting, which was also attended by his 
counterpart at the French National Assembly, Philippe Seguin. 
  "Balladur voiced confidence that, once this moment is behind 
us and a new parliament has been elected, Italy can fully resume 
its role in European and international politics," said 
Napolitano, also stressing that Italy's European commitment and 
the broad consensus of Italians around it would certainly remain 
as constants of Italian foreign policy in the future. 
  In a TV interview later, Napolitano reported that Prime 
Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's consultations in the last couple 
of days had "undoubtedly" provided him with clarifications of 
the positions of the various political parties and the 
no-confidence motion presented by many MPs in the majority. 
  The debate on the motion is scheduled on January 12 and, 
according to Napolitano, successive developments will depend on 
the climate in the debate and the assessments of President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro -- "assessments," Napolitano pointed out, "that 
have already been delineated well before this initiative of the 
no-confidence motion." 
  But Napolitano said Scalfaro's decision on whether and when 
to dissolve parliament does not depend solely on what the 
parties think, but will also take account of the need to 
"respond to a popular vote such as the one in the referendunm 
(in April) and the need to promote an indispensable political 
and institutional renewal." 
  In his remarks to ANSA, Napolitano said other points on the 
agenda with Balladur, apart from his briefing on the Italian 
political situation and European issues, included unemployment 
and the need for economic growth throughout Europe in order to 
combat it.

<F P=106> [Article by Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta: </F>
"NATO, We Italians, and the Rest"] 
  [Text] Newspaper and magazine editors have recently been 
criticizing Italian foreign policy. In particular, it is being 
stressed that the supposed "internationalist" inspiration of 
Italian policy -- in Somalia, in Mozambique, in support of the 
sanctions in Yugoslavia, in backing Yeltsin's reform policy, in 
the development of a common foreign policy at the European 
level, and in the GATT negotiations -- neglects "national 
interests." 
  According to these interpretations, Italy's busy activity 
within the international bodies is a way of evading decisions on 
points of position and emphasis -- for instance, between a 
"Mediterranean," rather than "European," role. 
  These criticisms are based on an anachronistic vision of 
foreign policy, are groundless, and, if supported, would prove 
counterproductive. 
  Italy does not have to choose between a Mediterranean and a 
European policy because there is no inconsistency between them. 
Indeed, we are important actors in the Mediterranean precisely 
because we are a European power and, vice versa, we are heeded 
in Europe partly by virtue of our special sensitivity to the 
problems of the South of the Old Continent. 
  Whenever in the past our foreign policy was unbalanced, the 
consequences were serious. Whenever we tried to become the 
foremost Mediterranean power we became, by the same token, the 
last of the European powers. Whenever we adopted aggressive and 
unilateral policies in the Mediterranean and Africa -- as with 
Crispi and Mussolini after 1934 -- we were left so isolated in 
Europe as to be forced into alliances that were contrary to our 
own interests. 
  Italy is a country that is now a full and fully qualified 
part of the West, so there is no reason to adopt any eccentric 
or unnatural forms of behavior. Furthermore, even though, 
because of our geographical position, we are exposed 
particularly to the instabilities caused by the end of the Cold 
War, we certainly do not have the resources -- economic, 
military, or in terms of public support -- to tackle these 
problems on our own or in a unilateral manner. 
  Rather, our main objectives are to strengthen collective 
instruments such as NATO, the European Union, the CSCE, and the 
United Nations. They have the legitimacy and the capability to 
prevent crises from degenerating and to enhance our credibility 
and assert our viewpoint more strongly. This means taking part 
reliably in these organizations' operations and development, 
rather than allowing ourselves to become marginalized by 
supposed selfish interests. In any case, the very development 
of military technologies has made peace indivisible. 
  Moreover, the very concept that Italian foreign policy is 
allegedly neglecting the national interest is without substance. 
It is surprising that this argument is being used by circles 
that are very critical of the Catholic vision of the common 
good. Indeed, there is no one nation personified in a single 
and consistent interest, as perhaps there was in the courts of 
dictatorial regimes, in which context, indeed the very concept, 
of the national interest was formulated. 
  In the modern world, however, the states and the complex 
societies that make them up have many varied, sometimes partial 
and conflicting interests. Some of the analysts with whom I 
have met to discuss the former Yugoslavia readily cite national 
interest and accuse the Foreign Ministry of aligning too much 
with European positions. 
  Beyond this, they sometimes seem divided between a 
pro-Serbian and a pro-Croatian conception of the national 
interest. Apart from ignoring the principle aspects of the 
matter, which are what specifically prompted us to support the 
Bosnians, these analyses therefore conceal personal sympathies 
and allegiances beneath the cloak and the powerful rhetoric of 
the national interest. 
  Perhaps it would be wiser to talk about general interests -- 
that is, interests that are the outcome of a great number of 
particular interests of individuals, regions, or economic groups 
that are themselves mutually conflicting -- without lapsing into 
the naivete of the existence of uniform national interests or 
the hypocrisy of portraying particular interests or opinions as 
the interests of all. Yet, again, our conscience forces us to 
mistrust these ideological pseudoconcepts. The skill of 
politics lies precisely in bringing together and moderating 
these differing interests. 
  This does not mean that Italy does not have a clearly 
defined path ahead of it. The "recent internationalist swing" 
has already set our country on this path. Indeed, we must help 
create the international conditions for our country's 
development, the very conditions that have for the past 40 years 
guaranteed the modernization of civil society and the growth of 
prosperity. 
  This progress is bound to a liberal and universal vision of 
international trade, keeping in mind that one-half Italy's 
exports go to countries outside Europe and 90 percent of those 
are outside the Mediterranean. Hence the change of approach 
that I introduced in the GATT negotiations, in the final months 
of which we were determinedly in favor of concluding the Uruguay 
Round and opposed to any parochial defense of supposed 
inalienable European interests. 
  This progress can also be achieved by strengthening our 
country's attachment to the architectures of the community of 
nations -- the only structures that can mobilize sufficient 
resources to guarantee a secure international environment and a 
transition to prosperity and peace for the areas of crisis. Not 
only will this permit us to avoid the costs that insecurity 
entails, but it will create new markets for our products. 
Indeed, the rationale of geoeconomics, albeit competitive, is 
different from the conflictual rationale of geopolitcs, because 
the "cake" to be shared out is growing all the time. Quite the 
opposite, therefore, of the unilateralist implications of those 
who cite "national interests."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Crime: Sisde Probe; Mancino Calls </F>
For Swift Clarification"] 
  [Text] Rome, 9 Jan (ANSA) -- Interior Minister Nicola 
Mancino today issued a communique stating that given the 
disparate press reports according to which various persons under 
investigation in the Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security 
Service] slush fund scandal have once again dragged his name 
into the case, he was urging justice officials in Rome to move 
even more swiftly to shed full light on his position. 
  It is necessary to re-establish the truth and to see to it 
that these slanders are not allowed to cast "absolutely 
unjustified shadows" over the landscape at a time already fairly 
harrowing for the nation's institutions, he said. 
  Renewed and immediately denied allegations by former Sisde 
domestic secret service treasurer Maurizio Broccoletti, 
interrogated after his extradition from Montecarlo this past 
week, of money for government politicians and a top-level 
cover-up, have also involved President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and 
two recent interior ministers, in addition to the present holder 
of the interior portfolio. 
  All have firmly denied the allegations and, yesterday, 
Mancino asked national police chief Vincenzo Parisi to stay in 
his post despite reports that he, too, had been placed under 
investigation by the magistrates handling the Sisde probe. 
  According to Assistant Prosecutor Michele Coiro, new 
testimony from ex-Sisde officials naming Mancino would be sent 
to the Ministers' Tribunal responsible for judging cases filed 
against government ministers. 
  Interviewed for the TG1 [First News Brodcast] newscast on 
the 
RAI [Italian State Radio and Television] first channel, Coiro 
said the testimony contained no new facts, but had to be passed 
on so that the tribunal would enjoy "the fullness of 
information." He added that the prosecutor's office is arguing 
simply that Mancino has no case to answer. Legal sources also 
pointed out that a prosecutor has an official duty to enter a 
name on the list of those entering an enquiry, even if only 
because they are subject to accusation in the testimony of 
someone undergoing questioning. "It's a purely formal act," 
Coiro pointed out. "As the chief prosecutor has already 
explained, in the very moment when a request was filed to shelve 
the allegation, he decided it was pointless to enter Minister 
Mancino on the register." 
  Earlier, Chief Prosecutor Vittorio Mele told reporters that 
Broccoletti's allegations of top-level meetings to cover up the 
misuse of Sisde funds concerned meetings or "separate 
encounters," in any case not held at the Quirinale presidential 
residence. 
  In his interview, Coiro said neither he nor his colleagues 
could report Broccoletti's statements in detail, but he 
confirmed that both Broccoletti and former Sisde director 
Riccardo Malpica had mentioned the meetings. 
  As some MPs from the governing majority started voicing 
fears 
that the situation may be too obscure to allow President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro to go ahead with calling elections, Coiro also 
confirmed the existence of "facts" suggesting an attempt at 
destabilising the institutions. In particular, he said most 
media had carried the report of Broccoletti's alleged reference 
to three cover-up meetings when this was in fact "an absolutely 
false item of news." He also said a similar argument had been 
applied to leaks that Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi was on the 
list of those under investigation. 
  "A group of magistrates is investigating the question, 
trying 
to see if there is anything in this attack on the president's 
prerogatives," he reported, "to try and understand who and why." 
  In a lengthy interview with ANSA, Mancino said of the Parisi 
case that, whether or not the entry on the list of those who 
have entered into an enquiry was secret or public, it allows 
"no-one to throw even a shadow on the person in question." 
  Being entered on the register authorises no-one to "even 
advance a suspicion against the chief-of-police or anyone else 
in the same position," he said, although he admitted that the 
situation would change if the person was moved from the list of 
those entering an enquiry to those who have been notified they 
are under investigation for a given crime. Someone can 
naturally be re-examined, but a `new fact' would be needed," 
Mancino said, charging that he had "never known the truth" from 
Malpica, who was director of Sisde from February 1987 to August 
1991. 
  Mancino, who supported Malpica for his subsequent 
appointment 
as special government commissioner in Turin, added that the 
ex-Sisde head "enjoyed the whole Interior Ministry's esteem." 
  "When we spoke of the question of Sisde's funds, he seemed 
to me to be a third party extraneous to the appropriation of 
public funds, but I was told there were secret service cover or 
guarantee certificates (for the funds)," said Mancino of charges 
that the accused secret service officials are withholding 14 
billion lire in government money, but had claimed the existence 
of certificates proving they held the money on the intelligence 
services' behalf. 
  "...I had no interest in covering up operations for the 
appropriation of public funds, nor did I have any interest in 
covering up for Malpica, also because at the time, I was unaware 
of any eventual responsibilities on his part." 
  The Interior Minister also claimed that he had "never known" 
what secret service cover or guarantee certificates were before 
his conversations with secret service officials on the 14 
billion lire. 
  Adding that he was someone who found "great difficulty" in 
reading his own bank account, Mancino commented: "I may be 
regarded as being inexpert, but someone who is unaware of how 
the mechanism of these cover certificates works can hardly be 
called to account for a defensive line concerning them." But if 
this is what Malpica is in fact arguing, Mancino added, "he is 
lying, and knows he is." 
  Mancino was equally adamant about reported allegations that 
he was one of the Interior Ministers who had received personal 
bonus payments from the secret funds or had taken part in 
cover-up meetings. Of the first, he said: "No-one ever 
mentioned these support payments to me. No-one ever proposed 
support payments to me, and I would in any case have turned them 
down. No-one will ever be able to argue the contrary." 
  On the second, he said: "I have never taken part (in 
meetings of this kind) at the Quirinale, the Interior Ministry, 
or anywhere else. No-one will ever be able to show that I 
brought together a few prefects in order to cover for persons 
whom I didn't even know." 
  In addition, he denied ever having given advice to anyone on 
the Sisde affair or agreed to a line of defence in it: "I have 
always had bilateral meetings (with Interior Minister officials) 
for duties inherent in my office...and I have always hoped that 
the magistrates were informed of the issues discussed in the 
same terms in which Prefect Finocchiaro and later Prefect 
Malpica too explained them to me." 
  Admitting that some people purvey "incomplete or distorted" 
information, Mancino agreed that the political situation was 
"shot through with not always clear, probably turbid interests" 
which, by putting his name in the headlines in connection with 
facts about which he knew nothing, harm "my person, the 
institutions, the general context..." 
  "Certainly, we are living through a transitional phase which 
should be seconded within respect for the institutional rules. 
This transition is encouraged by some, desired by others, and 
opposed by still others. One should see, then if among the 
latter, there aren't some interests being cultivated to weaken 
the image of the state and the institutions, in order to weaken 
the constitutional and institutional organs." 
  On his term at the Interior Ministry, Mancino said he put 
"intellectual honesty, firmness and determination" into the job. 
He also claimed not to have favoured the traditional policies, 
citing in particular the fact that he had dissolved "over fifty" 
city councils in order to break the link between elected 
officials and organised crime. 
  He also claimed credit for motivating the police, 
contributing to the capture of long-sought criminals, and 
"firing point-blank" at "secret lodges and other deviations 
against democratic order." 
  "In short," he asserted, "I can hardly deny that I have 
delivered blows, and heavy ones at that."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sisde Questioning: Rome Prosecutor </F>
Denies Press Accounts"] 
  [Text] Rome, 7 Jan (ANSA) -- Today's Italian press reports 
on what former domestic secret services (Sisde) comptroller 
Maurizio Broccoletti, suspected of embezzlement and criminal 
association, told investigators during five hours of questioning 
yesterday "contain many inaccuracies, and many elements 
particularly highlighted by the media do not in fact appear in 
Broccoletti's statements at all," the Rome Prosecutors Office 
announced today in a statement. 
  That statement came after a meeting in the office of Rome 
Prosecutor Vittorio Mele that included Assistant Prosecutors 
Michele Coiro and Ettore Torri, the officials who questioned 
Broccoletti yesterday in Regina Coeli prison. 
  While the prosecutors, citing judicial secrecy, did not 
"correct" press accounts in detail, sources close to that office 
described as "not true" today's newspaper reports of a 10 
billion lire transfer to the Christian Democratic party from 
Sisde secret funds, which leaks said Broccoletti had alleged. 
  That alleged payment was given considerable prominence by 
several dailies, which deduced that the "political party" 
referred to in leaks had to be the Christian Democrats -- based 
on the fact that party has had exclusive control of the Interior 
Ministry (which Sisde answers to) since 1946. 
  After Wednesday's [5 January] extradition from Monte Carlo, 
Broccoletti talked to prosecutors about the reported Sisde slush 
fund, alleging there had been a top-level cover-up -- also 
involving President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro -- of the breaking 
Sisde scandal. 
  Those charges, inexplicably leaked to the press with 
rapidity 
and in detail despite procedural secrecy rules, were given lead 
prominence in today's Italian press, touching, as they do, the 
figure of President of the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, in 
what some called a move to delegitimate the country's highest 
authority just as elections were about to be called. 
  According to at least one paper, Broccoletti was said to 
have 
told the prosecutors that three top-level cover-up meetings took 
place from December 1992 to late spring last year, as evidence 
of the misappropriation of at least 14 billion lire by Sisde 
officials including Broccoletti began to surface. The first was 
allegedly attended by then premier Giuliano Amato, all three by 
Scalfaro and Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, as well as police 
chief Vincenzo Parisi, who all reiterated yesterday that the 
charges "had absolutely no foundation." 
  Talking today with journalists, prosecutor Michele Coiro, 
said that while the overall investigation of the Sisde scandal 
is "quite complex," there is "one thread of that investigation 
that is nearing the point where we can ask for a formal 
indictment." He said that the charge would probably be for 
embezzlement, and that the investigation would continue to 
follow other leads. 
  Broccoletti is expected to be questioned again on Monday, 
when he will be asked about how Sisde managed funds in the 
period before Riccardo Malpica was appointed to head the 
intelligence service. 
  As for the questioning of Gerardo De Pasquale, former Sisde 
officer taken into custody yesterday, authorities said that 
would probably take place tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by Carmen Parra: "Government Increases Minimum Wage </F>
by 3.5 Percent and Completes Labor Reform Measures"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The cabinet yesterday completed the 
package of labor reform measures. It approved six measures, 
only one of which -- the new trade union election regulations -- 
has been agreed to by the trade unions. The measures concerning 
reforming dismissal, collective bargaining, and regulations 
governing apprenticeship contracts, and increasing 1994 pensions 
by 3.5 percent are rejected by the trade unions and are the 
catalyst for the 27 January general strike. Agreement als has 
not been reached concerning the increase in the 
interprofessional minimum wage, which is scheduled to rise 3.5 
percent -- the figure proposed by the government. 
  Yesterday's cabinet meeting was of a markedly economic 
nature. The government approved the outstanding labor reform 
measures, including a draft bill reforming the Workers' Statute 
in the sections concerning dismissal and collective bargaining. 
It includes a measure on trade union elections, to which the 
main trade unions agreed, and is the only agreement reached in 
the dialogue process, which has been taking place since August. 
  A second draft bill legalizes temporary employment agencies. 
The government approved regulations which finally pave the way 
for introducing apprenticeship contracts and amending the terms 
of part-time work and practical training, and gave the go-ahead 
for the measure on establishing a schedule for various 1994 
social-security pension brackets. 
<H5>  Pensions Increase </H5>
  The increase in all pensions from 1 January, as envisaged by 
the overall state budgets, will be 3.5 percent, and it is 
accompanied by a review clause which will be applied if real 
inflation is higher than forecast -- 3.5 percent. This 
guarantee clause embodies the formula proposed by the trade 
unions, although full agreement was not reached in the 
negotiations with the government because of some loose ends. 
Total 1994 expenditure on pensions will be 5.8 trillion pesetas 
-- 8.6 percent higher than this year. The maximum state pension 
will be 254,140 pesetas per month, equivalent to 3,557,960 
pesetas per year. 
  The 1994 interprofessional minimum wage (SMI) will increase 
by 3.5 percent, in contrast to the 6.5 percent proposed by the 
trade unions, which were demanding the recovery of the lost 
purchasing power. The SMI for workers over the age of 18 is set 
at 60,570 pesetas per month and 847,980 pesetas per year. For 
those under the age of 18, it will be 40,020 pesetas per month 
and 560,280 pesetas per year. Temporary workers over the age of 
18 will be paid 2,870 pesetas per day, and those under the age 
of 18, 1,896 pesetas. 
  Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan said after the cabinet 
meeting that the aim of the labor reform package is for "every 
possible job to become a reality." The government hopes that 
the measures approved yesterday will enjoy as much support in 
parliament as the reform of personnel recruitment achieved 
Tuesday -- over 90 percent. If any kind of agreement can be 
reached with the employers' organization or with the trade 
unions, it will be embodied in the texts submitted to the 
Congress [of Deputies]. 
  Yesterday, Grinan stressed once again the government's 
desire 
to reach an agreement on incomes for the next few years, 
although it will undertake no initiative beyond what the 
employers' organization and the trade unions decide, because 
"the responsibility" for negotiating the agreements rests with 
them. 
  In order to complete the package of measures approved 
yesterday, only regulations concerning the implementation of 
personnel recruitment reform remain. This reform involves 
introducing subsidies for enterprises -- mainly small 
enterprises -- that hire unemployed people receiving 
unemployment benefits. 
  Jose Antonio Grinan specified yesterday that the government 
wants these initiatives to enjoy the greatest possible agreement 
among the political parties, and that the government is 
considering to which groups this assistance should be allocated 
and what kind of measure to introduce in order to ensure that 
the resources devoted to unemployment help establish active 
employment policies.

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
correspondent Gordon Brewer in Brussels on 7 January; from the 
"Newsnight" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Brewer] Why is there such reluctance to set a 
timetable for bringing East European countries into the alliance? 
  [Woerner] The reason is very simple. You are confronted with 
two historic tasks. One, which is always forgotten, is the main 
historic objective of building a new comprehensive Euro-Atlantic 
security structure that will include Russia, not exclude it. 
That is in the interests of all European nations, especially 
the nations of Central and East Europe. The second historic 
task is to anchor those who belong to the West, the new 
democracies, firmly in the structures of the West. 
  [Brewer] So it's your hope that the Partnerships for Peace 
can be a prelude to NATO membership and not a substitute for it? 
  [Woerner] That is not my hope, that is my certitude for some 
of them. Some of them may and will become members -- at least 
that's my expectation. Others will use the Partnership for 
Peace just to improve cooperation with us. 
  [Brewer] Have you had a rough time with the British, French, 
and Americans? I mean after all you were much keener on this 
idea than they were. 
  [Woerner] I would not call it a rough time, rather a very 
interesting time. Well this is an alliance of several, 
important nations. This is a very important question, one of 
the most important ones with very, very complicated conclusions 
and consequences, so obviously you need a certain type of 
discussion to harmonize your views and to come to a consensus. 
I think we will reach it clearly at the summit; we have 
prepared it very carefully. 
  [Brewer] If we are to concentrate on being friends with the 
Russians as well, what is the point of having NATO? 
  [Woerner] NATO is the only remaining real element of global 
stability today. The transatlantic axis that links the two most 
important power centers of the West -- North America and West 
Europe -- is rightly seen not only by our member nations but 
also by others as the core of any future security structure. If 
you separate North America from Europe you will create a lot of 
additional dangers. 
  [Brewer] What are you going to say to the East Europeans 
after the summit when they say to you: Look, thank you very 
much, but we are frightened of resurgent Russian nationalism. 
We have got Mr. Zhirinovskiy saying he is going to invade us in 
10 minutes if he can get away with it. We need not all these 
fine words, we need Article V, we need a cast-iron guarantee 
that our security lies with Europe. 
  [Woerner] The first thing I would say to them is the closer 
you move to NATO the more secure you will be. The second is 
that there is not this alternative between guarantee and vacuum; 
that's the wrong alternative. The third is if you cooperate 
closely with NATO, whatever happens in Russia your security is 
inseparably linked to ours, so if there would be anybody who 
would think it appropriate to attack or invade those countries, 
he would still have to calculate NATO reactions.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 9 (AFP) -- The NATO summit opening 
here Monday [10 January] should "seriously" study the 
possibility of launching air attacks against Bosnian Serbs, 
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said Sunday. 
  Speaking after talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
Dehaene said the West had to send a signal of its determination 
to act in the face of continuing bloodshed in Bosnia. 
  NATO agreed in August to launch air raids on Serbs in the 
former Yugoslav republic if requested by the United Nations to 
break the siege of Sarajevo and other Moslem communities. 
  But it has yet to be given the green light by UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, even as the shelling of Sarajevo 
has intensified in recent days. 
  "We must seriously consider the possibility of launching air 
raids," Dehaene told reporters after his meeting with Clinton. 
"I think that more and more countries agree on this." 
  France is pressing the two-day summit to take strong action 
on Bosnia but there is little sign the United States is ready to 
support any new initiative. 
  Washington once strongly supported air raids, but U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher last week repeated 
warnings that such attacks were bound to endanger UN forces 
guarding relief operations on the ground.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- NATO will issue a "wide 
invitation" during a two-day summit here for the countries of 
the former Soviet bloc to move closer to the Atlantic alliance, 
British Prime Minister John Major said Monday [10 January]. 
  "It will be a very wide invitation that is extended to 
Central and East European nations, Russia, Ukraine, and I very 
much hope they will take it up," Major told reporters on his 
arrival at NATO headquarters. 
  He said the Partnership for Peace plan under which the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization would give former East bloc 
countries a cooperative link with the Atlanic alliance but not 
full membership was the best option at present. 
  The British leader also said the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
was of concern to NATO heads of state and government, 
"particularly amongst those with large numbers of troops there." 
  But he indicated there was unlikely to be any major change 
in 
NATO policy on the 21-month conflict, noting that the alliance 
had already approved the use of air strikes if requested by the 
United Nations. 
  "That was the position and that remains the position today," 
Major said.

<F P=106> [Report by political editor George Jones: "Major Tells of </F>
His Frustration Over Bosnian Conflict"] 
  [Text] Mr Major yesterday fuelled speculation the Army 
will withdraw from Bosnia in the spring when he spoke of his 
"frustration" at the way the warring factions were preventing 
them from carrying out their humanitarian duties . 
  But he made clear the Government was not yet ready to back 
demands for air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces shelling 
Sarajevo. Britain would, however, be prepared for strikes to 
protect UN forces. Last week the UN commander in former 
Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot of France, complained UN soldiers 
were being humiliated and inhibited from taking the action 
necessary to fulfill their duties. He said the UN must consider 
"offensive intervention." 
  Mr Major, interviewed by Sir David Frost on BBC television 
yesterday before leaving for Brussels last night, rejected 
suggestions the shelling of Sarajevo during the Christmas 
ceasefire and other Serb actions meant the time was right for 
air strikes. 
  While acknowledging the last few days had been "unhappy and 
frustrating," he underlined the Government's opposition to being 
dragged into a conflict in Bosnia, saying the conditions for air 
strikes against ground targets had not been "entirely satisfied." 
  Mr Major added: "All three parties in the dispute have been 
saying one thing in Geneva about wishing to have peace, but 
their actions on the ground of their guerrilla groups say 
precisely the opposite. Everyone is getting very frustrated 
about that. 
  "The humanitarian position is very serious. It has got worse 
and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the forces to 
carry out their role." 
  The conflict in former Yugoslavia is expected to be 
discussed 
at today's NATO summit in Brussels despite President Clinton's 
desire that a meeting called to shape the future of the Alliance 
should not become bogged down in a dispute over Bosnia. 
  Leaders of the 16-nation NATO alliance will also be 
discussing the extent to which NATO should scale down and 
concentrate more on peacekeeping as a rationale for its 
existence. 
  Mr Major said the alliance was at a pivotal stage. "NATO's 
role needs to be revised and extended." 
  But there were still a range of trouble spots.... "We need 
to make sure we don't let our military guard down despite the 
capacity there is for reductions in military expenditure. 
Nobody is going to take those too far," he said. 
  He gave his backing to the "Partnership for Peace" plan 
proposed by Mr Clinton. It offers increased co-operation with 
East Europe, holding out the prospect of eventual NATO 
membership. 
  Mr Major sought to play down criticism that the plan had 
been 
watered down in the face of Russian protests and would not meet 
the concerns of East European nations. 
  He said reform in Russia, rather than security guarantees, 
held the best hope of long-term freedom for the former communist 
countries. 
  Despite the success of the ultranationalists in last month's 
Russian elections the reformers still got a majority of the 
votes.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien said on Friday [7 January] his government would decide 
whether to withdraw its 1,500 peacekeepers from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina next March or April. 
  Speaking after talks of more than an hour with French 
President Francois Mitterrand, Chretien said that Canadian and 
French troops were playing "a very useful role in extremely 
difficult circumstances," and that the question of their mandate 
would be discussed at next week's NATO summit in Brussels. 
  Earlier this week, the prime minister said Ottawa was 
considering withdrawal of its troops, who are blocked in the 
Moslem enclave of Srebrenica. On Friday, he said there would be 
a debate in parliament before a decision was taken. 
  "Canada has always been there for peacekeeping but it is not 
peacemaking because we do not have the means to do that and it 
is a kind of in-between, not much military in many ways, it is 
more Red Cross type of work," Chretien said Friday. 
  He added: "It seems to be a conflict that has no solution at 
this moment. The United Nations have passed resolutions but we 
do not have the means to enforce their decisions so peacemaking 
does not exist. In Bosnia it is not a question of peacekeeping 
because there is no peace." 
  Chretien was due to lunch with Premier Edouard Balladur 
later 
Friday. He arrived in Paris late Thursday at the start of his 
first official visit to France, after a short stay in London. 
  Canada is in dispute with France over fishing quotas allowed 
to the French archipelago of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, in 
Canadian territorial waters off Newfoundland. 
  The French consider the quotas insufficient and after 
negotiations broke down, Canada imposed a moratorium on cod 
fishing for both its own and French fishermen to allow 
reconstitution of stocks. 
  After a private stay in Paris, Chretien was to travel to 
Brussels on Sunday to attend the NATO summit.

peacekeepers' patience there is at an end. He said that if the 
factions are not interested in making peace, Canada will pull 
its peacekeepers out of Bosnia and send them home. Mr. Ouellet 
spoke to reporters in Brussels in advance of tomorrow's NATO

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia `Invited' To Join NATO </F>
Summit"] 
  [Text] Bosnia, where the situation of local population and 
blue helmets is increasingly deteriorating (UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] military observers said that numerous civilians are 
about to die of starvation in the region of Kakanj), will be the 
last-minute "guest" of the upcoming NATO summit to be held on 
10-11 January in Brussels. Besides, France called upon NATO to 
send the warring factions a clear political message to stop 
hostilities. 
  The issue of the former Yugoslavia will not be on the agenda 
of the 16 NATO heads of state and government but will 
nevertheless be raised by France, which hopes that NATO, and 
also the United States, will strongly support the peace efforts 
deployed, so far in vain, by the Europeans, indicated officials 
wanting to preserve anonymity. Paris would like NATO to support 
the peace plan elaborated by the Twelve in December. 
  The same officials say that the other topics on the summit 
agenda, namely the U.S. Partnership for Peace proposal offered 
to the ex-Soviet Bloc and the reinforcement of the European 
defense strength, should be endorsed without difficulty by the 
heads of state and government. 
  On the other hand, the discussion on Bosnia might be more 
lively owing to persistent divergences of opinion among the 
Allies. Furthermore, reliable sources say that Washington does 
not want the Bosnian issue to overshadow its proposal to open up 
NATO to East European countries, which in its opinion, remains 
the priority issue of the summit.

  [Text] Everybody agrees that there is a need to reexamine 
the issue of the presence, and particularly the role, of the 
blue helmets in Bosnia. [French] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, 
who wants NATO member countries to discuss this in Brussels on 
Monday [10 January], met today in Paris with the mediators, Owen 
and Stoltenberg, who have for months now been leading with 
difficulty the peace negotiations on the former Yugoslavia. 
They all agree that if a negotiated solution seems impossible, 
conclusions should be drawn and the current peacekeeping 
operation should be reexamined.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Ambassador to Belgium Andrzej </F>
Krzeczunowicz: "NATO Summit Should Make It Clear That No One 
Has a Veto Right Over Us"; first paragraph is DE STANDAARD 
introduction] 
  [Text] Many NATO countries provide a series of arguments to 
only make a vague commitment on the eastward expansion of the 
alliance on the summit to be held in Evere on Monday [10 
January] and Tuesday. These arguments do not convince the 
Central European countries that are on the first row for 
membership. Today Andrzej Krzeczunowicz, Polish Ambassador to 
Belgium, has the floor and tomorrow it will be the turn of the 
deputy chief of the Hungarian mission to NATO, Andras Simonyi. 
  [Doornaert] One of the arguments, among others of the 
Belgian 
diplomacy, is that the major problem of the Central and East 
European countries is one of social instability, not of foreign 
security. And that NATO membership will not remedy this. 
  [Krzeczunowicz] But it is exactly the opposite. Poland is 
internally stable, we have a democratic system that works. The 
economic shock therapy is yielding results. It is true that it 
is hitting hard many people by marginalizing them. 
Nevertheless, the macroeconomic results are good. Last year, 
we registered a 4.5 percent growth, the European record, with a 
rise of 7 percent in our industrial production. 
  Therefore, we feel at ease. One of our large neighbors 
speaks of its "bordering foreign countries," its sphere of 
influence. This is distrurbing. To the east, there are 
countries where foreign troops are still stationed, minority 
problems that might represent a threat. The instability does 
not emerge from us but from the neighbors. 
  The recent events in Moscow do not make us feel very 
optimistic. The Parliament was shelled by tanks, and afterwards 
a totally irresponsible individual shows up who acquires 
one-fourth of the votes. 
  [Doornaert] That is why NATO is saying that we should avoid 
doing anything which could support Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Krzeczunowicz] Look, anyone could use Zhirinovskiy for his 
own purposes. One can say as well that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is the 
product of the West's timidity. I cannot prove that, but you 
cannot prove either that a moderate attitude will moderate 
Russia's attitude, too. Appeasement is not a wise policy, as 
became obvious previously. 
  [Doornaert] Do you mean that the best way to avoid security 
problems in Central and East Europe is to create a reliable 
deterrence policy by means of security commitments? 
  [Krzeczunowicz] Exactly. The opposite attitude would be to 
say: Dear Russian friends, here is your area of influence. And 
NATO should say: This is our area of influence, meaning an area 
of peace and stability. Indeed, keep in mind that NATO won the 
Cold War. It cannot be lost now, that would be stupid. 
  We feel that it is important that at the summit NATO will 
undertake to include the Central European countries meeting the 
standing criteria, i.e., stable democracy, pluralism, settling 
of border and minority questions. 
  Poland realizes fully that it cannot become a NATO member 
tomorrow, that this requires numerous changes of our defense 
mechanism. However, it is important that a clear commitment is 
made so that the Partnership for Peace does not become an 
objective in itself, but the way to full membership. Otherwise, 
it cannot respond to real problems and the security vacuum will 
not be filled up. 
<H5>  European Union </H5>
  [Doornaert] Belgian diplomats suggest that the Visegrad 
countries follow a logical order by becoming European Union [EU] 
members first, then of the Western European Union [WEU], and 
then of NATO. 
  [Krzeczunowicz] Of course we want to become a member of the 
EU and of the WEU, we already are an associate member. Also we 
do not define security in a purely military sense. The fact 
that the EU sets up protectionist barriers against us is equally 
at our disadvantage. 
  But before becoming a full member we will have to wait at 
least 10 years and our security cannot wait that long, that is 
the problem. 
  [Doornaert] It has also been said that the expansion of NATO 
toward the Visegrad countries would draw new artificial lines in 
Europe, which would be a destabilizing factor. 
  [Krzeczunowicz] But there have always been barriers, 
nowadays 
they exist too. There is NATO and the EU and the other 
countries. It is impossible to cancel all barriers at once in 
such a diversified continent, but one has to place them so that 
they have a rational function, namely to serve peace and 
stability. Leaving the barriers as they are nowadays is not 
rational at all. 
  [Doornaert] How is it possible to enlarge NATO while 
avoiding 
giving Russia a feeling of isolation? 
  [Krzeczunowicz] No one wants to isolate Russia, and 
certainly 
not Poland. Let us admit that it is particularly difficult to 
isolate a country which stretches over 11 time zones. Poland or 
the much smaller Lithuania will definitely not isolate giant 
Russia. 
  Secondly, from a historical point of view, Russia has rather 
been inclined to isolate itself. It is up to Russia to open up 
to the world and the democratic process. We will be the first 
ones to welcome that. Poland assumes that there cannot be any 
lasting peace and stability in Europe without a Russian 
participation. No one wants to cut Russia from Europe and erect 
a new [Berlin] wall somewhere. We did not build walls, nor did 
the West. 
  [Doornaert] Does NATO's attitude -- which gives priority to 
possible reactions in Moscow to the desire of the Visegrad 
countries for membership -- give the impression that your are 
being held in a kind of restricted sovereignty? 
  [Krzeczunowicz] Well, if you recognize that a country has a 
veto right on the choice of an alliance that Poland should 
conclude, than Poland's sovereignty is restricted. If you do 
not recognize that right of veto, then we are a sovereign 
country. The decision does not rest with us, NATO must make it 
clear that there is no right of veto.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- NATO opened a two-day 
summit here Monday [10 January] aiming to build a post-Cold War 
security order for Europe rooted in military and economic 
cooperation with its former Soviet bloc foes. 
  The 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was 
expected 
to approve a U.S. proposal for limited East-West military 
cooperation and send a signal of its eventual intention to take 
in new members. 
  But with East European states pressing to join NATO over the 
strenuous objections of Russia, NATO made it clear it would do 
nothing to antagonise Moscow and hurt its programme of reforms. 
  "Our vital objective remains to build a new comprehensive 
Euro-Atlantic architecture of security with, and not without or 
against, Russia," NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said in 
his opening speech. 
  He said the message for Russia's former satellites was "we 
shall not leave you alone," but added: "When we extend 
membership of NATO to new countries it will be to help stabilise 
Europe and not to divide it again." 
  Woerner, who met just before the summit with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, echoed the themes laid out by the American leader 
in a major policy address here Sunday. [passage omitted] 
  The 21-month-old conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has 
split the alliance at times, was likely to figure in the 
discussions here. But NATO diplomats said they expected no new 
concrete initiatives. 
  France and other countries are lobbying for NATO to launch 
air attacks on the Bosnian Serbs as promised in August if 
requested by the United Nations to break the siege of Sarajevo 
and other Moslem communities. 
  But Washington, which backed the air raids last May but was 
frustrated by European opposition, now appears reluctant to act, 
warning the attacks could endanger humanitarian operations on 
the ground. 
  Britain has also balked at the possibility of air raids for 
fear of reprisals against its troops serving with the 
10,000-strong UN contingent in Bosnia. But British Prime 
Minister John Major said on arriving at the summit, "We set that 
out some months ago that we would go ahead with air strikes. 
That was the position and that remains the position today," he 
said.

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>
  [Text] The head of NATO held out the "hand of friendship" 
to Russia today, but warned the Western Allies to maintain their 
guard against old and new aggressors. 
  Manfred Woerner, opening a summit in Brussels which will 
determine the future shape of European defence strategy, said 
the vital objective was "to build a new comprehensive 
Euro-Atlantic architecture of security with, and not without or 
against, Russia." 
  The NATO's secretary-general said NATO alone could guarantee 
security to its member nations "because it is the only 
functioning collective defence organisation on the globe." 
  It was the "key element" of stability in a world hit by 
instability, crises and conflicts. No new security order in 
Europe was conceivable without NATO, insisted Mr. Woerner. 
  But he warned that NATO could "wither away" without a clear 
sense of purpose and that it could be threatened by stagnation 
and even erosion. 
  "Our Alliance needs continuous investment, not only of 
resources and manpower, but even more so of political energy and 
the determination on both sides of the Atlantic to use it as the 
main forum of consultation and the most effective instrument of 
our security and defence." 
  Mr. Woerner applauded U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative as the way to extend defence 
cooperation and stabilise the whole of Europe. 
  "We will allow no one and nothing to manoeuvre our Alliance 
into a false alternative; to have to choose between Russia and 
the other cooperation partners." 
  He said the message to the new democracies in central and 
eastern Europe was: "We shall not leave you alone. We care 
about your security which is of direct and material concern to 
us." 
  But Mr. Woerner gave no clue as to a timetable for opening 
NATO's doors to new members. He said that when NATO membership 
was extended to new countries it would be to help stabilise 
Europe and not to divide it again. 
  He emphasised that a significant level of U.S. forces 
permanently based in Europe -- pledged last night by Mr. Clinton 
-- would remain "an indispensable component" of the security 
strategy. 
  Mr. Woerner said that Alliance structures had to be 
developed 
for more flexible security and warned: "More flexible 
structures will serve our purpose only if we maintain an 
adequate level of well trained and well equipped armed forces 
backed up by adequate resources. The fewer the means at our 
disposal, the fewer our options." 
  He told the summit that NATO had to prepare for new security 
risks, particularly arising from the proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction. "Nonproliferation is our priority, but it may 
not suffice. We have to look also at the appropriate means of 
protection."

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister John Major today declared NATO's door 
open to new members, but said it was not yet possible to say who 
would qualify to join, nor when. "Those who wish to join have 
much work to do, with our assistance, to prepare themselves," he 
told a summit of the leaders of existing NATO members in 
Brussels. 
  Mr. Major said the main challenge facing the alliance was 
deciding what relationships to develop with the new democracies 
in East Europe. 
  Extending NATO was a process only now just beginning -- "an 
evolutionary and transitional process without a predetermined 
end result," he warned on the first day of the two-day meeting 
which will shape future defence strategy for the whole of Europe. 
  The governments of Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and 
the Czech Republic, worried by the surge of right-wing extremism 
in Russia, want early NATO membership, with firm security 
guarantees. 
  But even as the summit got under way, hard-line Russian 
nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy warned that 
incorporating former Soviet bloc states into the alliance could 
lead to World War Three. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has warned that expanding 
NATO at present could play into the hands of his country's 
nationalist extremists and destroy democratic reforms. 
  The summit will set out NATO's determination to accept new 
members in an "evolutionary process" and make clear that no 
country, including Russia, has a veto -- but will not specify 
criteria for membership or set a firm timetable, effectively 
shutting out new partners for at least four more years. 
  Mr. Major told the summit: "It must be our objective to 
consolidate democracy in all of the countries to the east now 
embracing it, to develop a closer partnership with them and to 
help to enhance their security and stability." 
  But there would be no single blueprint for future links. 
  "These countries are not all alike and NATO's relationships 
with them will differ," he said. 
  He welcomed the "Partnership for Peace" initiative launched 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton, saying: "The process could 
clearly lead to the admission of new members. The door is open. 
We cannot yet define who will be able to meet the obligations 
of membership, or when." 
  The Poles, Czechs and Hungarians were in the front rank, but 
there must not be a new dividing line in Europe which would 
re-create opposing blocs. "We must show that NATO is a genuine 
partner for democratic Russia, not an opponent. It is therefore 
essential for NATO to build a closer relationship with Russia 
which acknowledges that country's special status," Mr. Major 
said. 
  NATO's success as a cornerstone of post-war European 
security 
could not be taken for granted, and maintaining a security 
"insurance" required a continuing commitment. 
  Today the summit was battling with real conflict on its 
doorstep as well as preparing for longer term security -- Bosnia 
hung like a black cloud over the plaudits for NATO's past 
successes. 
  Mr. Major was adamant that NATO had so far worked 
efficiently 
in the former Yugoslavia, supporting the United Nations, 
enforcing sanctions in the Adriatic, carrying out air operations 
and planning for a peace implementation operation. But he 
admitted that, as Bosnia struggled through another winter of 
war, the allies faced serious questions which the summit could 
not resolve.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- French President Francois 
Mitterrand urged his NATO colleagues here Monday [10 January] to 
take action in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but diplomats said the summit 
was unlikely to adopt any new initiatives. 
  "It is good to make commitments but we must keep them 
tomorrow," Mitterrand said at the opening session of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation's two-day summit here, according to 
spokesman Jean Musitelli. 
  France and other countries are lobbying for NATO to launch 
air attacks on the Bosnian Serbs as promised in August if 
requested by the United Nations to break the siege of Sarajevo 
and other Moslem communities. 
  But Washington, which backed the air raids last May but was 
frustrated by European opposition, now appears reluctant to act, 
warning the attacks could endanger humanitarian operations on 
the ground. 
  Musitelli said U.S. President Bill Clinton told the summit 
that Washington was ready to go along if "each country assumes 
its responsibilities to implement what will have been decided." 
  Britain has also balked at the possibility of air raids for 
fear of reprisals against its troops serving with the 
10,000-strong UN contingent in Bosnia. 
  British officials said the summit would do little more than 
reaffirm the August decision to put its air power at the United 
Nations' disposal if requested. 
  "Reaffirming them means being ready to implement them. The 
situation could evolve in such a way that would call for their 
implementation," one said. 
  France has also called in recent days for the boosting of UN 
forces in Bosnia and application of UN Security Council 
Resolution 836 aimed at using Western air power to protect UN 
troops and Moslem "safe areas." 
  British Prime Minister John Major said the summit had to 
consider "what realistic help we can continue to give to keep 
Bosnians alive and encourage the peace process." 
  Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana told reporters here 
that the 21-month-old conflict embroiling Bosnian Serbs, Moslem 
and Croats "is a conflict that does not have a military 
solution." 
  He said the UN presence in Bosnia "will not be eternal" and 
a 
decision on its future would have to be taken after the winter 
if a peace accord is not struck. 
  Clinton also reiterated the United States' readiness to send 
troops to Bosnia to help police and enforce an eventual peace 
agreement, if the U.S. Congress agrees, according to Musitelli. 
  But U.S. officials have said congressional approval to 
provide up to half of a planned 50,000-strong force was in doubt 
following peacekeeping debacles in Somalia and Haiti. 
  The leaders were expected to discuss Bosnia as well as the 
situation in Russia over dinner Monday night, officials said. 
  The foreign ministers of France, Britain, Spain and Canada, 
which are contributing the bulk of the UN troops protecting 
relief operations in Bosnia, were to confer at the same time.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- NATO must expand 
gradually into East Europe with attention to the "special" 
importance of Russia and without undermining democratic reform 
there, British Prime Minister John Major said here Monday [10 
January]. [passage omitted] 
  French President Francois Mitterrand also cited the need to 
avoid "countering" the development of democracy in Russia. 
  He described the plan for gradual expansion endorsed by NATO 
leaders, known as Partnership for Peace, as "reasonable" and 
said it was "a form of real guarantee" for the security needs of 
the new democracies in East Europe. 
  A spokesman for Mitterrand said former Soviet states now 
worried about the potential of renewed Russian expansionism 
should interpret the partnership as a promise that "now war 
could threaten their territorial integrity and sovereignty."

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- NATO leaders endorsed 
Monday [10 January] a plan for military cooperation with their 
former Soviet bloc enemies as a step towards possible 
enlargement of the 16-member alliance, NATO sources said. 
  The said the U.S. proposal, dubbed "Partnership for Peace," 
was adopted on the first day of a two-day summit aimed at 
building a new security order for Europe after the Cold War. 
  The scheme would offer Russia and its ex-satellites 
cooperation in planning, training and other activities as well 
as crisis consultations. It would be considered an essential 
but not automatic step towards NATO membership.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by Klaus-Peter </F>
Siegloch in the ZDF studio in Mainz -- live] 
  [Text] [Siegloch] Mr. Ruehe, after Clinton's speech [in 
Brussels tonight], can the reform states be satisfied with the 
message of Partnership for Peace? 
  [Ruehe] Mr. Siegloch, I think that all Europeans can be 
satisfied, for now it is clear that Partnership for Peace is not 
a substitute for NATO membership, but that it makes a 
step-by-step entry possible. It does not discriminate against 
anyone; yet, it offers the possibility to differentiate. That 
means that those countries that are seeking membership -- and it 
is also in Germany's interest that our eastern border is not for 
ever the external border of NATO and the European Union -- now 
have the opportunity to closely cooperate with NATO and prepare 
themselves for membership. 
  [Siegloch] Still, Poland and others were hoping for a 
quicker NATO membership. Has this Clinton message also taken 
Yeltsin's situation into account? 
  [Ruehe] Well, one could not expect that it would pave the 
way for membership right now. The important thing is that NATO 
is now fundamentally opening up and that the would-be members 
will now use the time for working their way toward NATO -- for 
example, to create military structures that will make real 
membership possible. For German politics, it was also important 
that one does not have to choose between Moscow and Warsaw, 
because then one would have done everything wrong right from the 
start. We need partnership with Russia, between NATO and 
Russia, but we also need the possibility of expanding NATO by 
those countries that are seeking such membership. 
  [Siegloch] Military cooperation has been offered. What 
could that look like? 
  [Ruehe] There are very concrete proposals. As early as this 
year -- and those who are seeking membership can pursue that 
with particular intensity -- there should be joint exercises. I 
think we will also participate in such programs. We should then 
coordinate armament systems to make them compatible; the full 
range of possibilities will be explored for such countries that 
want to work their way toward NATO. I am in favor of initiating 
concrete programs very soon -- sometime this year -- with, for 
example, Poland, Hungary, the Czechs, and Slovaks. 
  [Siegloch] You have mentioned joint exercises. Let us 
imagine a scenario of a real conflict in the East. What would 
happen then? Would NATO stand idly by or would it intervene? 
  [Ruehe] I think that what the U.S. vice president said on 
behalf of the President is right, namely that U.S. security is 
linked to the security of East Central Europe. This applies, at 
least, equally to West Europe, too. It means that as long as 
there is no full membership, there can be no full guarantee. 
However, West Europe can, of course, not at all be indifferent 
to what is going on at its eastern border. At the moment, I see 
no danger of a military conflict. Still, the political 
revolution is not over yet in Europe. Its climax was in 1989, 
and we are well-advised to strengthen this major anchor of 
stability, NATO, in the future, too, and the Germans must 
continue to make an important contribution with its Bundeswehr. 
By the way, many of our neighbors in East Europe are hoping for 
cooperation, particularly with Germany. 
  [Siegloch] That means that there will not be any security 
guarantees in the real sense for the East and Central European 
countries? 
  [Ruehe] No, not in the form that exists among NATO member 
states. However, there will be continually improving and 
intensifying cooperation. Besides, there will also be joint 
peacekeeping missions, even before membership. I think that 
this will also indirectly enhance security. Anyway, the 
security of the Poles has a lot to do with the security of the 
Germans. This applies for West and East Europe as a whole. 
  [Siegloch] One short question on the timeframe. Membership 
not until the next century? 
  [Ruehe] I do not think that one should put it off 
artificially for so long. I see a possibility still in this 
decade, and, thus, also in this century. 
  [Siegloch] Thank you very much, Mr. Ruehe.

  [Excerpt] The question of NATO membership for Central and 
East European countries is the main element behind the 
importance of this NATO summit. The leaders of NATO member 
countries, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, French 
President Francois Mitterrand, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
and British Prime Minister John Major, were received by 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner upon their arrival at NATO 
Headquarters. 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller arrived at NATO Headquarters 
accompanied by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. Before the 
opening session of the summit, Ciller held her first bilateral 
meeting with Major. It was learned that PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] terrorism in particular, the developments in northern 
Iraq, and the Cyprus problem were discussed during the meeting, 
which lasted approximately half an hour. 
  During the coffee break prior to the opening session, Ciller 
exchanged views with the prime ministers of Greece, Spain, and 
Denmark individually. Ciller proceeded later to the summit 
hall, where she was approached by Clinton. They held a 
three-minute conversation. Ciller also spoke separately to the 
prime ministers of Britain, Spain, Norway, and Germany.

  [Text] Bonn, Jan 9 (AFP) -- NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner has won his battle against cancer after three operations 
and said he had a good chance to live, the Sunday weekly BILD AM 
SONNTAG reported. 
  "I have beaten cancer," Woerner told the paper. "Doctors say 
I have an excellent chance" to live. 
  The interview was published on the eve of a two-day summit 
meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. 
  Woerner, 59, who was West German defense minister from 1982 
to 1988, said he was operated on for the third time in 
mid-December in Aachen, western Germany. 
  He underwent surgery for colon cancer in April 1992 and June 
1993.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan 7 (AFP) -- North Korean officials met 
Friday [7 January] with representatives of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for "working-level" talks on the 
inspection of nuclear sites, a statement said here. 
  The statement said only that "a contact" had taken place 
between North Korean representatives to the IAEA and officials 
from the nuclear watchdog but did not give any details except to 
say "the contact is expected to continue next week." 
  North Korea had agreed to a resumption of international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities after a gap of almost a 
year, a senior U.S. State Department official said Wednesday. 
  But Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis would not be pinned 
down on whether North Korea had agreed only to a single 
inspection of its seven previously visited nuclear facilities, 
as press reports had suggested, rather than a resumption of 
regular visits. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency has made it clear 
that 
they regard regular inspections as the basic condition to be 
able to ensure continuity of safeguards and verify that North 
Korea was not developing a nuclear weapon. 
  The IAEA said Thursday it had not received any notification 
from North Korea that it was ready to allow resumption of 
regular inspections, and at a meeting Wednesday the Pyongyang 
side simply took note of an IAEA request to discuss details of 
renewed inspections and said it would report back.

Alternative Service Reform"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- On the holiday [Epiphany, 6 January], 
Franz Vranitzky and Erhard Busek, the chairmen of the coalition 
parties, announced new initiatives to bring the talks on 
alternative national service to a conclusion after all. As has 
been reported, [Defense Minister] Werner Fasslabend, Austrian 
People's Party [OeVP], and [Interior Minister] Franz Loeschnak, 
Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], suspended the talks 
on Tuesday without any results. The contentious issue was the 
duration of national alternative service. 
  SPOe Chairman Vranitzky said the SPOe has already 
contributed 
so much in terms of improvements and concessions that he does 
not understand why the OeVP cannot "take this last step." He 
wants to call on Loeschnak to talk with Fasslabend once again, 
the chancellor said. 
  Busek said he would be pleased if Vranitzky gave Loeschnak 
new leeway for negotiations.

<F P=106> [Hannes Reichmann report: "`Adolfovich's' Helpers"] </F>
  [Text] The 15-square-meter office at 4 
Hammer-Purgstall-Gasse in Vienna's Second District is dominated 
by a collection of antique samovars from Macedonia and a whole 
battalion of selected French brandies. 
  The approximately 60-year-old host gingerly picked up a 
plastic covered sheet of paper that has made the owner very 
happy in the past week. The document carries the headline 
"Authorization." The authorized German translation beneath 
reads: "I herewith confirm that Mr. Svetoslav Stoilov is my 
first adviser on economic and entrepreneurial issues." The 
document, dated 28 December 1993, carries the scrawly signature 
"Vladimir Zhirinovskiy." 
  If one of the two gentlemen had not caused considerable stir 
throughout Europe in the past two weeks with his strange ideas, 
one might simply dismiss the verbal outcome of this friendship 
between Stoilov and Zhirinovskiy as the mere twaddle of two odd 
birds. Yet the Bulgarian-born Svetoslav Stoilov, who has been 
living in Vienna with an Austrian passport for 30 years and 
whose gold-colored calling card identifies him as a 
"consultant," has unconditionally offered his services to a man 
who is probably the most dangerous politician on the continent 
-- Vladimir "Adolfovich" Zhirinovskiy, who as head of the 
right-wing extremist "Liberal Democratic Party of Russia" (LDP), 
was the surprise winner of the Russian parliamentary elections 
and who will in the future lead the second strongest group of 70 
parliamentarians after Yeltsin's reformers. He arrived on a 
spectacular "private visit" to Austria on 22 December. 
<H5>  The Program </H5>
  During his four-day visit, Zhirinovskiy skillfully dealt all 
sides radical nationalist verbal blows. The program of his 
visit and the real purpose was determined exactly before he 
arrived. His trip was based on solid entrepreneurial motives. 
When the trained lawyer arrived on the evening of 22 December 
in a Lauda Air plane from Munich (where he met with head of the 
right-wing extremist "German People's Union," Gerhard Frey) at 
Vienna's Schwechat Airport, the "Antiterrorism Task Force," the 
elite Interior Ministry troop, was alerted. Half a dozen 
officials did not leave the Russian's side from then on. 
  After landing in Klagenfurt, the police officers saw a 
bizarre succession of events in the days that followed. While 
the journalists, who had arrived from all over Europe, 
concentrated on Zhirinovskiy and his Carinthian host, timber 
merchant Edwin Neuwirth from Reichenfels, the advisers of the 
Russian politician arranged numerous business meetings. Large 
limousines with all kinds of license plates arrived at the 
"Rainsberg" hotel. "We received businessmen from Austria, 
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia 
here," the 67-year-old Edwin Neuwirth boasted. 
  Neuwirth, an ethnic German from Transylvania, who 
volunteered 
for the Waffen-SS when he was 16 and who has been living in the 
Lavanttal Valley since 1953, attracted the reporters' attention 
with solid Nazi slogans. "I do not know of any gas chambers in 
Germany," he stated in an interview with Austrian radio. As a 
result, the public prosecutor in Klagenfurt initiated 
investigations because of the suspicion of the violation of the 
law banning Nazi activities. "I just think in national terms. 
Zhirinovskiy is as national and liberal as Joerg Haider," 
Neuwirth complained. 
  In the meantime, the "advisers" of Neuwirth's visitor 
Zhirinovskiy devoted themselves intensively to the businessmen 
who had arrived. A police official, who was disguised as a 
skier wearing a black bobble hat, took numerous pictures. The 
state police and officials from the German Federal Intelligence 
Service (BND), who arrived especially because of the 
Zhirinovskiy visit, are now hectically evaluating these pictures. 
<H5>  Ivanovic's Oweka </H5>
  One of the entrepreneurs was Petar Ivanovic. The 57-year-old 
businessman from Serbia has been living in Austria since 1968 
and is carrying on trade with the East as the manager of the 
Oweka trading company, located at 31 Praterstrasse in Vienna. 
He primarily sells petrochemical products. In his best year -- 
in 1990 -- the turnover of the company involved 700 million 
schillings. An "Oweca Petrol AG" in the small town of Glarus in 
the Swiss canton of the same name is registered as the parent 
company of the Vienna Oweka firm in the trade register. 
Strangely enough, there is neither a postal address nor a 
telephone number for this company in Glarus. 
  It is still unknown what Ivanovic and his aides Mirko Milic 
and Goran Miletic discussed specifically with Zhirinovskiy's 
clan in Carinthia. Nobody in Ivanovic's office answered the 
phone up to the editorial deadline. However, there are signs 
suggesting that Ivanovic has financial problems, and that he is 
urgently looking for new business partners. In reply to a 
credit inquiry, the "Credit Protection Association of 1870" 
wrote: "The enterprise has a poor credit standing." The 
forwarding agency Technokontrol, another of Ivanovic's 
enterprises, filed a petition for bankruptcy as recently as in 
December. A third company is not exactly thriving, either: The 
Indiptrading Handels GmbB company, which Ivanovic operates in 
Montenegro with partners from Titograd and whose deals are 
violating the UN sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. 
  An investigator believes Ivanovic came to Carinthia for the 
following reasons: "There are hints that one of Zhirinovskiy's 
financial advisers is establishing cover companies in Western 
Europe and is looking for partners so he can fully participate 
in oil trade." The name of this man is Alexej Wedenkin, and he 
procures cash for the extremist from Moscow. "Mr. Wedenkin has 
established 10 enterprises in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, 
and Switzerland," Zhirinovskiy's host Neuwirth pointed out. 
  Wedenkin boasted: "We have millions of dollars." A certain 
Dimitriy Klinkov is also commuting between Klagenfurt and 
Moscow. Klinkov, 23, uses the title of "trade director" of the 
IBC GmbH company. The IBC registered in Klagenfurt belongs to 
Josef Hambrusch and is carrying out trade with the East. Asked 
about his links with Zhirinovskiy, Hambrusch replied: "No 
comment. We do not want to see our names in the newspapers." 
  The Klagenfurt businessman confirmed, however, that he knew 
two other visitors who had come to Carinthia: Werner Girke and 
Werner Neumann from Berlin. The two men are responsible for 
discreet trust transactions about which they did not want to 
talk. Their Berlin Fiduciary Management and Organization GmbH 
company (TVO) is considered a center of Zhirinovskiy's West 
German investments. "Chief Executive" Girke only stated: "We 
deal with property management. But we do not grant any 
interviews." 
  Zhirinovskiy's most interesting interlocutor had to make the 
longest journey: The Russian Anton Nenakov, 26, from Amsterdam, 
where he is the head of the Global Money Management Trust 
enterprise. At present, he is allegedly trying to obtain a 
permit to establish an investment bank, and he provided funds 
for Zhirinovskiy's election campaign in December. 
  From Belgium, a man arrived in Carinthia whose name is, in 
all likelihood, Luc L. (the full name is known to the editors). 
He is 65, and has for decades been operating a successful 
enterprise in Antwerp that sells all kinds of weapons. L's 
specialty is supplying rebel organizations in Black Africa with 
military equipment. Zhirinovskiy is pleading for massive 
investments in the ailing Russian defense industry. After all, 
envoys of Fikret Abdic, the Muslim feudal entrepreneur and head 
of the Agrokomerz concern which was involved in a scandal in 
Bihac in western Bosnia, wanted to persuade Zhirinovskiy to pay 
a short visit to his country. Zhirinovskiy, however, refused 
because of the concerns of his security advisers. 
<H5>  Stoilov's Show </H5>
  When the Russian and his entourage left Vienna on 25 
December 
aboard a Balkan Air aircraft for Sofia, the show of 
Zhirinovskiy's Vienna adviser Svetoslav Stoilov began. 
Zhirinovskiy took up the invitation of the Bulgarian living in 
Austria who was born in the Bulgarian part of Macedonia. They 
visited Stoilov's home town of Sandanski. "We went to 
Thessaloniki in Greece without a visa, and Vladimir swam in the 
Aegean Sea," Stoilov stated enthusiastically. Bent over the book 
"Alexander the Great and his Time," the ardent advocate of a 
Macedonian nation stressed: "Zhirinovskiy said I would be the 
better Bulgarian president. I told him: `Vladimir, you cannot 
simply give me all that.'" 
  The eclat was perfect. President Zhelev ordered the 
expulsion of the Russian because he babbled about "Thrace's 
reunification." The long-planned visit to Berlin did not come 
about either. This time, the Berlin enterprise TVO and Messrs. 
Girke and Neumann were supposed to act as hosts. They had 
invited Zhirinovskiy. Yet the government in Bonn denied him a 
visa. As a result, Zhirinovskiy railed against Germany after 
this return to Moscow and threatened, among other things, to 
start a "third world war." 
  "I will take care of things in the future," Svetoslav 
Stoilov 
stated at his Vienna office, trying to calm things down. "I 
will write most of his speeches, and I will exert a moderating 
influence. We are talking on the telephone every day." 
Consultant Stoilov, who claims to have initiated a number of 
prestigious projects for renowned Austrian companies trading 
with the East, referring to the career opportunities of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, "whom I met accidentally at the Bolshoi Theater in 
Moscow five years ago," stated: "In four or five months at the 
latest, he will have ousted Yeltsin and will be president. And 
I will advocate an independent state for all Macedonians from 
Greece, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. A roundtable should decide as 
soon as possible on the return to Germany of the territories 
occupied by Poland." 
  Once he had warmed up, the fanatic Stoilov explained with a 
flaming red face how his adopted country Austria should profit 
from his activities as an adviser: "South Tirol must be 
returned to Austria as soon as possible."

<F P=106> [Report signed "C.S.": "Counterfeit Dollar Gang: Leader </F>
Arrested in Vienna"] 
  [Text] The head of the gang that wanted to circulate some 
970,000 counterfeit dollars in the Vienna area is in prison: 
Alfred Hanl, 46 and a businessman from Vienna, was arrested in 
Vienna on Sunday [9 January]. It is not yet known if there is a 
direct connection with the producers of the counterfeit money. 
What is certain, however, is that it was made abroad. 
  Counterfeit dollars worth some 11 million schillings were 
seized in Salzburg on Friday, and seven suspects were arrested. 
Now the identities of those arrested have been released: Hanl's 
closest collaborator is Elmar Geisler, 56, from Vienna. The 
messengers who wanted to hand the counterfeit money to those 
distributing it near Salzburg were Johann Erben, 54, from 
France; Hans Hrabak, 56, who lives in Vienna and Zurich; and 
Helmut Boidol, 45, from Schallstadt, Germany. 
  Erben and Boidol are also thought to be those responsible 
for 
getting the counterfeit dollars to Austria from abroad. 
  In addition, counterfeit money messengers Hans W. (31), a 
computer expert from Paech in Switzerland; Peter S., 50, from 
Vienna; and Alfred P., 39, from St. Andrae-Woerdern, Austria, 
were also arrested. House searches have been ordered at the 
dwellings of all those who were arrested.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 8 (AFP) -- Deputy Belgian Prime 
Minister Guy Coeme has been implicated in a corruption scandal 
over a 225 million dollar army helicopter contract, according to 
a leaked judicial report published by newspapers here Saturday 
[8 January]. 
  The probe says Italian constructor Agusta won the contract 
by 
offering a 413,000 dollar bribe to Coeme's Socialist Party, and 
links the payment with bitter party infighting and the still 
unresolved killing of former party boss Andre Cools. 
  Coeme, defence minister when the contract for 46 helicopters 
was signed in 1988, faces a grilling by deputies Thursday during 
a session to discuss the lifting of his parliamentary immunity. 
He denies any wrongdoing. 
  However, the report by investigating magistrate Veronique 
Ancia says "promises -- concerning the purchase of the Agusta 
helicopters which was a Defence Ministry affair -- (were made) 
of payments to the Socialist Party." 
  Ancia concludes that the 1988 contract was tainted by 
numerous "injustices...and forgery." 
  Coeme is alleged in the report to have rejected out of hand 
a 
bid by German firm MBB without consulting the country's 
financial watchdog, and to have cut short the examination of the 
two other bids, by Agusta and the French firm Aerospatiale. 
  An Agusta consultant quoted in the Ancia report said Coeme 
"decided to speed things up in order to avoid a lower bid from 
Aerospatiale." 
  The report also implicates Guy Spitaels, the then Socialist 
Party chief and current head of the Walloon (French-speaking) 
regional government, and Socialist Senator Guy Mathot, saying 
they "could be accomplices and jointly (responsible for) the 
corruption of a minister." 
  The probe began after Cools, a former minister and Socialist 
Party boss, was gunned down in July 1991. 
  According to the Ancia report, Cools was sidelined from the 
Agusta deal and the pay-off promised by the Italian constructor, 
the money going being siphoned off "following a move by the 
three Guys" -- Coeme, Spitaels and Mathot. 
  Shortly afterwards, Cools tried to oust Spitaels as party 
leader, the report noted.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that the 
incidents caused by the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] organization in Belgium must be condemned by the 
whole world, and added that international cooperation in the 
struggle against terrorism is inevitable. TRT correspondent 
Yasar Kefeli reports from Brussels: 
  [Begin recording] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who arrived 
in Brussels today to attend the NATO summit, received the 
representatives of the Turkish community in Belgium and listened 
to their problems. Ciller stated that the Turkish state wants 
to help Turkish citizens abroad in a way that will keep them 
from forgetting their origins. Pointing out that some of the 
just causes of Turks living in Belgium can be addressed 
immediately, Ciller said: Some of the incidents that occurred 
in this country particularly have saddened and deeply hurt you 
all. The whole world should condemn the recent PKK actions. 
These incidents have caused concern among our citizens here. 
We will have the opportunity to raise this matter again with 
the relevant authorities and on the necessary platforms. 
  Conveying their problems to Ciller, representatives of the 
Turkish community in Belgium remarked in turn that the local 
media and political circles leveled unjust accusations against 
the Turkish community with regard to the incidents triggered by 
the PKK in Brussels. The representatives asked the prime 
minister to send a Turkish parliamentary delegation to Brussels 
to investigate and clarify the matter. [passage omitted] [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lubbers Says Request for U.S. </F>
Support in Bosnia Still Lacks Credibility"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- Prime Minister Lubbers believes the 
countries of Europe must first try to bring the violence in 
Bosnia under control before asking the United States for help. 
He believes that a request to Washington to supply ground 
troops will lack credibility as long as Europe fails to honor 
its own agreements. 
  Lubbers was reacting Friday [7 January] to the call by the 
[Netherlands] House of Representatives for a substantial U.S. 
military presence in Bosnia because the present force there is 
inadequate. The question of Bosnia will feature on the agenda 
of the NATO summit to be held 10-11 January in Brussels. 
  "In principle, the United States must participate," Lubbers 
said in the Second Chamber on Friday. "It is more credible, 
however, if Europe first provides extra troops itself." 
  The PvdA [Labor Party] and VVD [People's Party for Freedom 
and Democracy] are rallying behind French Defense Minister 
Philippe Leotard, who intends to ask Washington to intervene in 
order to protect the citizens of Bosnia and to provide them with 
more aid. Foreign Minister Kooijmans described the French 
statements as hypocritical. 
  The United States only wants to provide large quantities of 
ground troops to the UN force when the warring factions have 
concluded a peace settlement. At present, the United States is 
only participating in air operations over Bosnia. 
  National Defense Minister Ter Beek said the Netherlands is 
still prepared to send a battalion of the airborne brigade to 
the Muslim enclaves of Zepa and Srebrenica. The previously 
planned departure was postponed because Serbian troops are 
completely blocking access to the "safe areas." 
  During the extra committee meeting, the House of 
Representatives also debated the topic of NATO expansion, with 
the government parties CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and 
PvdA putting pressure on Lubbers and Kooijmans to bring forward, 
during the NATO summit, the date of NATO membership for Poland, 
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. According to the CDA 
and PvdA, NATO must speed up its expansion before the Russian 
extreme nationalism of Zhirinovskiy takes hold over those 
countries. 
  Under the leadership of the United States, NATO is not in 
favor of rapidly granting membership to former East Bloc 
countries. NATO does not want to go further than a "Partnership 
for Peace," comprising closer political and military cooperation. 
  Lubbers said NATO should not allow itself to be led by fear 
of the far right. He merely wants Russia to have its fair share 
of participation in the "responsibilities and opportunities" of 
the partnership. 
  According to Lubbers, the formula for cooperation currently 
on offer presents brighter prospects for a "gradual" expansion 
of NATO. That process must begin next week, he said, and allow 
for the possibility of membership in the long term, "because it 
has to sound promising," continued Lubbers. 
  There is no indication yet how long the countries of East 
Europe will have to wait for membership, Minister Kooijmans 
said. "The tempo depends on the participation of the various 
countries involved. That will emerge in due course."

<F P=106> [Report by Philip Johnston: "Time Running Out, Major Tells </F>
the IRA"] 
  [Text] Mr Major's efforts to broker a Northern Ireland 
peace agreement appeared to be bogged down last night after he 
rejected Sinn Fein's demands for further clarification of the 
British-Irish declaration on the future of the province. 
  Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused the Government 
of making "no attempt to bring us on board" and said he wanted 
Mr Major to abandon what he called the Unionist veto over future 
moves towards a united Ireland. 
  There was now "a standoff," he said. "If the republican 
struggle needs to continue for the next 25 years, then so be it. 
We continue for the next 25 years." 
  Nearly four weeks after the declaration was signed at 
Downing 
Street by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime 
minister, doubts remain over whether the IRA is prepared to give 
up violence and enter the political process. 
  Mr Major, interviewed by Sir David Frost on BBC television 
yesterday, said he was still prepared to wait for an answer, but 
his patience was not inexhaustible. He also accused Sinn Fein of 
trying to muddy the waters by seeking further clarification. 
  "What at present is going on is that they are seeking to 
muddy that issue, to enter into negotiations effectively without 
giving up violence," Mr Major said. 
  "Well that is not on offer. They do have to give up violence 
and then the way forward to a democratic future is perfectly 
clear, and the way forward for them to get into the talks about 
the democratic future for Northern Ireland is perfectly clear." 
  At the weekend, Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP 
[Social Democratic and Labour Party], urged the Prime Minister 
to agree to Sinn Fein's request for clarification set out in a 
letter sent by Mr Adams to Downing Street. Labour's spokesman, 
Mr Kevin McNamara, also believes Sinn Fein is justified in 
asking for further interpretation and there are signs of growing 
strains between London and Dublin over the issue. Mr Reynolds 
is due to make a keynote speech later today setting out where he 
thinks the process is leading. 
  But the Prime Minister won support for refusing to be drawn 
further on the declaration from Mr John Smith, Labour party 
leader. He appeared to differ with Mr McNamara when he said: 
"The danger is that we enter into negotiations before we have 
got the abandonment of violence." 
  Mr Major clearly believes he has gone as far as he can in 
seeking to accommodate the Provisional IRA without losing 
backbench support. 
  "I think what Mr Adams is about is seeking to drag us into a 
negotiating position. I am not going to be drawn into 
negotiations by the back door by Mr Adams." 
  Mr Major denied Sinn Fein's suggestion that the Government 
has not done enough to bring the IRA into the political process. 
"We have offered them much more than the extra mile," he said. 
"We have offered them a route into the democratic talks 
themselves. That is what is on offer. All they have to do is 
give up violence." 
  Mr Major, who again ruled out an amnesty for convicted 
terrorists, indicated that the time was approaching when a 
definitive Sinn Fein response was needed. "I have said I am 
prepared to be patient. It is worth a little patience while 
they examine whether they are going to give an affirmative 
answer to give up violence. 
  "The world does not stop during that period.... I can be 
patient for a little while. There will come a time when it is 
apparent that they are not going to respond. We will know 
it--rather like an elephant, you will know it when you see it. 
  "It can't be too long, but I am prepared to be patient for a 
little while."

Operation Into Syria"] 
  [Excerpt] Adana--Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has confirmed 
the MILLIYET report on the operation the security forces have 
carried out in Syria. She said: "Cross-border operations have 
taken place." 
  While flying to Adana to attend the True Path Party meeting, 
Ciller answered a MILLIYET correspondent's question about the 
credibility of reports that the security forces have crossed 
into Syria by asserting: "Cross-border operations take place on 
our eastern border from time to time. We shall continue to take 
the measures required to end terrorism. The question of 
cross-border operations is always on Turkey's agenda. It will 
continue to be on the agenda." 
  Asked whether the border between Turkey and Iraq was 
included 
in the plans for the cross-border operation, Ciller said: "We 
have informed our neighbors not to attach too much importance to 
the air and ground operations. Penetrations have been made into 
Turkey from Iraq, but they were insignificant. Turkey is fourth 
on the list of countries with many neighbors. It is time for 
Turkey's neighbors to prove their friendship with our country. 
This year will be one in which the important stages of this 
issue will be wrapped up." [passage omitted]

  [Text] It has been announced that the Turkish Armed Forces 
is determined to preserve its deterrent and defense powers and 
to continue its support of the security forces in their struggle 
against separatist terror. 
  A statement issued by the Chief of the General Staff's 
Office 
recalls that discharges from the Armed Forces have been stopped 
temporarily. Noting that the Armed Forces have mobilization and 
peace cadres, the statement adds: The mobilization cadre is 
implemented in times of war or the possibility of war. The 
peace cadre is one that is implemented during peace time in a 
bid to carry out training and administrative activities. It is 
designed in a way that will facilitate a speedy transition to a 
mobilization cadre if need be. The end of the cold war period 
-- as a result of the developments that occurred in the new 
world order -- and the reduction of forces following the CSCE 
agreements and the European Conventional Arms Reduction Treaty 
have necessitated the restructuring of the Turkish Armed Forces. 
Within the framework of this restructuring, peace cadres have 
been reduced and compulsory military service has been reduced 
from 18 to 15 months. An annual shortage of 110,000 persons is 
felt in these cadres, because of an increase in the number of 
unregistered persons and draft evaders due to the lack of 
deterrent criminal sanctions and because of the unlawful 
suspension of military service in the open university and other 
educational institutions. 
  The statement notes that the Armed Forces are authorized to 
perform their duties in accordance with the Constitution and the 
laws, adding that the issue has been taken to the National 
Security Council in a bid to eliminate the current shortage. 
Pointing out that urgent and significant points have been 
proposed to the government in a bid to solve the problem 
quickly, the statement continues: Although draft bills have been 
prepared in line with these proposals, it will take a long time 
for the results to be attained, even if the bills are 
immediately enacted. The risk and the threat, however, are 
continuing. Therefore, deferring discharges temporarily -- as a 
measure that can be taken in the shortest possible time -- has 
been put forward to the government as a significant request and 
a decision has been adopted for its implementation. This move, 
whose reasons have been cited above, is directed toward 
completing the peace cadres and is not linked to mobilization. 
This is a normal move to complete peace cadres.

  [Text] National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has said 
that, in comparison to previous years, regional developments 
have reached more serious dimensions, adding that Turkey is 
obliged to be constantly vigilant regarding its defense. 
  On his return from Tunisia, Golhan replied to reporters' 
questions at Esenboga Airport regarding the decision to 
postpone, on a one time basis, the discharge of soldiers and 
noncommissioned officers. Pointing out that the potential treat 
to Turkey is gradually increasing in light of recent 
developments, Golhan recalled that the government has decided to 
stop terror this winter and spring. He said: 
  [Begin Golhan recording] As you know, a cabinet decision 
last year decreased the term of military service. We reduced it 
from 18 to 15 months. We had also reduced some of our military 
units in accordance with the European Conventional Arms 
Reduction Treaty. We eliminated some of our units in various 
regions. We are in need of experienced privates and 
noncommissioned officers for a few more months. I would like to 
state that we need them because the potential threat against 
Turkey has increased. Furthermore, since we came to power we 
have been talking about an operation in the winter and the 
spring against domestic threat. We need this postponement for 
this operation as well. Had the normal discharges been carried 
out, our soldiers would have been released in another month and 
replaced by inexperienced ones. It would have been difficult to 
achieve the success we desire with our young boys arriving at 
their units after basic training and lacking regional 
experience. We would also have left them in a difficult 
position fighting terror. Taking all these reasons into 
consideration, we have postponed by four months the discharge of 
privates and noncommissioned officers. [end recording] 
  Golhan stated that local elections will be held in March, 
adding that sound elections cannot be held without eliminating 
terror in the east. Noting that the discharges have been 
postponed on a one time basis for four months, namely from 
February through May, Golhan stated that the decision was made 
in December. He said: The Turkish soldier values his life, but 
above all he values his country. Certain values are dearer than 
life. Love of country, flag, and nation are among these values.

<F P=106> [Report by Saygi Ozturk: "Mentese Will Visit al-Biqa' </F>
Valley"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Internal Affairs Minister Nahit Mentese and 
Director General of Police Mehmet Agar will visit Damascus in 
January. The visit will add a new dimension to the favorable 
relations Turkey and Syria have recently established. Mentese 
will visit the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] camp in the 
al-Biqa' Valley; the camp was closed some time ago. 
  In a statement to HURRIYET, Agar said: "Syrian officials 
want us to visit the al-Biqa' Valley. We probably will. Our 
relations with Syria are very favorable. Of course, results 
cannot be achieved immediately. Nevertheless, all the closed 
doors have been opened." 
  A Syrian delegation will visit Ankara in February after the 
Turkish delegation headed by Nahit Mentese visits Syria. A 
Turkish delegation headed by Kamil Tecirlioglu, deputy director 
general of police, returned to Ankara from Damascus with 
favorable impressions the night before last. Tecirlioglu 
discussed the revelations by Syrian citizens arrested in Turkey 
and asked the Syrian officials to clarify the situation. The 
Syrian officials were reluctant to give Tecirlioglu detailed 
information on PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's situation. The 
Turkish delegation's impression was that Syria is reluctant to 
return Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey. 
  In a statement during the Turkish delegation's talks in 
Damascus, Major General Budayr al-Hasan, deputy under secretary 
of the Syrian Ministry of Internal Affairs Security Department, 
said his country has nothing to gain from activities that 
threaten Turkey's security and territorial integrity.

  [Text] Turkey has expressed deep concern about the 
resumption of the intensified armed clashes in Afghanistan which 
claim many lives and cause great destruction. Turkey says that 
it is a great misfortune for the friendly and brotherly Afghan 
people that clashes continue when domestic peace should be 
established and when all efforts should focus on rebuilding the 
country. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement on the issue says Turkey 
insistently defends the need to establish a national [word 
indistinct] that will comprise all the groups in Afghanistan. 
It says: We urge all Afghan groups to stop this fighting among 
brothers and to make the necessary efforts to sign a lasting 
cease-fire as soon as possible.

  [Excerpts] Ankara, Jan 9 (AA) -- Turkish diplomats working 
in Turkish Embassy crossed the Afghan-Pakistani border to go to 
Islamabad after a 24-hour ceasefire took effect just after dawn 
on Saturday [8 January] in Kabul after seven days of bloody 
factional battles which left parts of the Afghan capital in 
flames, it was reported on Sunday. 
  Mustafa Asula, Turkish ambassador in Pakistan, told AA 
reporter on the phone that they expect the diplomats to arrive 
in the afternoon. 
  Two dozen foreigners, including four UN staff and diplomats 
from Pakistan, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Libya, drove out 
of the war-shattered city in the afternoon in two convoys headed 
for neighbouring Pakistan. 
  It was not clear whether the convoys would cross into 
Pakistan through the Khyber pass or halt for the night in the 
eastern Afghan town of Jalalabad. 
  But some Pakistani and Saudi diplomats, as well as several 
from Indonesia, North Korea and Iran and one Palestinian, stayed 
on. Sudanese diplomats left on Friday. [passage omitted] 
  Turkey said on Friday it would evacuate its ambassador and 
three other staff from its embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul, 
rocked by a week of factional fighting. 
  A missile landed in the embassy garden last weekend.

  [Text] An Iraqi delegation headed by Iraqi Foreign 
Ministry Under Secretary Riyadh al-Qaysi, who arrived in Turkey 
yesterday, began to hold contacts in Ankara today. 
  Al-Qaysi first visited Foreign Ministry Under Secretary 
Ozdem 
Sanberk. The two delegations later held talks headed by the two 
under secretaries, respectively. 
  Before the meeting, Sanberk said Turkey supports protecting 
Iraq's unity and integrity, and sincerely hopes that country 
will reassume its place in the international community. 
  Sanberk stressed that the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline is 
an important investment for both countries. We have been 
discussing the pumping of the oil in the pipeline for some time 
now, he said. We have been making contacts and working on ways 
to eliminate the problems created by the fact that the pipeline 
was idle for three years, he said, and on ways to reactivate the 
system once the embargo is lifted in the future. 
  Sanberk said that at the meeting they would discuss what 
kind 
of a common solution can be found to the problem within the 
framework of UN Security Council resolutions. 
  Al-Qaysi said relations between the two countries are 
historical ties of friendship. We will exchange views, he said, 
on issues concerning the two countries. 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet will receive the Iraqi delegation 
this afternoon.

<F P=106> [Report by Ismet G. Imset; punctuation as published] </F>
  [Text] Turkey last week found itself once again in the 
midst of a debate with regard to taboos over the country's Armed 
Forces and whether anyone had the right to call for the lifting 
of such taboos without ending up being branded as a traitor. 
Strongly-worded statements made by Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan 
Gures were undoubtedly the highlights of the debate, in the form 
of a top level warning to all who dared to table and discuss 
such issues. 
  On the one hand, there were reports of increased draft 
evasion spreading throughout the country. On the other, Gures' 
own son Serdar had become a target for criticism, suspected of 
using family influence to dodge compulsory military service. As 
if this was not enough, two journalists had even dared to put on 
a TV program about draft evasion. 
  Coming one after another, these developments clearly 
disturbed Gen. Gures for, during a visit to Bolu, he departed 
from his official text and ended up delivering an ultimatum. 
According to him, the debate targeted the very command center 
of the Turkish Armed Forces and was the work of "dwarfs and 
miserable people," individuals and groups with the aim of 
inflicting damage on the Turkish military. 
  It is still not clear which of the developments was the last 
straw for Gures but the general suspicion is that his latest 
statement, which put to flight many newsmen, was designed to 
defend Serdar more than the army itself. 
  Those journalists who refused to be scared thus ended up 
defending their position in commentaries, and underlining that 
they had no wish to damage the armed forces but wanted only to 
deal with the deficiencies of the whole system. 
  It quickly became apparent that what was debated was not 
military service and/or Serdar's conduct but the fate and 
functioning of Turkish democracy as a whole. 
  What Gen. Gures did last week, in the words of one prominent 
columnist, was to slap the press across the face... 
<H5>  A Blow to Serdar </H5>
  The whole debate actually started months ago with reports 
that Serdar Gures was a draft evader. News was that this bright 
new name of mischief in Turkish society, an apprentice actor 
climbing the ladder of success, was using family influence to 
dodge his military service. 
  Serdar was not a new name for Turks fond of scandal or 
society pages. It was claimed that he had once been escorted by 
troops in a hotel raid which he organized as part of a personal 
vendetta. His name also surfaced in a holiday resort where he 
allegedly used a police pistol to bash the head of someone he 
had fought with. Then there were numerous reports of his 
alleged love affairs. This year, when his dog was said to have 
been killed by poisoning, there were even claims that the 
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was warning the father 
through the son's pet. Serdar, it appeared, was a focus for 
scandal reports and did little to keep out of the media's way. 
His name had surfaced as early as last year when a left-wing 
weekly magazine noted in its cover story that a majority of 
officers' children did not serve in the troubled Southeast 
region, where more than 2,000 security personnel have died since 
1984 in Ankara's war on separatist terrorism. 
  It resurfaced sometime last month immediately after Turkey's 
Defence Minister announced publicly that the number of draft 
dodgers in this country had reached an all-time high of 
250,000--about half the current strength of Turkey's army. The 
statement led to debate on what could be done to fill this gap, 
and there was much speculation that the entire military service 
system would be reviewed and that the term of service could be 
increased despite Turkey's drive for a more compact and modern 
army. In the process, prison terms and fines for draft evaders 
were increased. 
  As for Serdar, he was cited among the 250,000 and there were 
claims that he had evaded military service by extending his term 
in school. The report, however, was a mere claim until his 
teachers at the state conservatory, led by Ahmet Levendoglu, 
held a shocking press conference at which they disclosed the 
truth. 
  Serdar, who had been attending the drama department at 
Istanbul University's State Conservatory for the last five 
years, allegedly was accepted by the school due to pressures 
exerted by his family, and although he was not even attending 
classes, had managed to graduate to the fourth year. Actor and 
director Levendoglu, who previously resigned from the board of 
education to protest at Serdar's special treatment, told 
journalists that Gen. Gures's son had been accepted into the 
school through the influence of then rector Cem'i Demiroglu. He 
was reportedly brought to the school by a senior aide of his 
father's and there and then became a student. 
  But he failed classes for two years and did not fulfill his 
student requirements. He did not attend rehearsals but despite 
all of this, managed to continue his studies for the duration of 
five years. 
<H5>  The Response </H5>
  The irony of the whole issue was that the incident emerged 
at 
the same time as Ankara's efforts for further recruitment and it 
was clear that what Serdar was doing was overshadowing these 
efforts. 
  If--as the son of Chief of Staff--he was indeed evading 
military service, then how could the Chief of Staff's office 
explain to the rest of the Turkish people why they should go and 
fight for their country, and perhaps die in the process, in the 
troubled Southeast? 
  Moreover, reports of Serdar's alleged draft dodging 
coincided 
with a strongly-worded statement from Chief of Staff spokesman, 
Col. Dogu Silahcioglu. 
  At about the same time that Turkey was debating what Serdar 
had done, Silahcioglu made a statement referring to draft 
dodgers and said, "The nation will probably never forgive 
them...those who should really be sorry for what is happening 
are the families of the people who will do anything to avoid 
military service and thereby have lost their principal values." 
According to him, draft evaders would certainly be punished 
"the way they deserve, and will live with this disgrace for the 
rest of their lives." 
<H5>  Arrested Newsmen </H5>
  Just at the moment when Turkey had Dogan and Serdar Gures as 
well as the overall draft dodging crisis on the operating table, 
the Chief of Staff took one step which further complicated the 
debate. 
  Already, eyes were turned on Dogan Gures due to the 
behaviour 
of his son, and there were questions on what he was planning to 
do about his own family while calling on others to serve their 
country. Statements by Silahcioglu and the defense minister had 
further escalated the debate and, naturally, all reporters were 
interested in covering the issue in one way or the other. Draft 
evasion had thus become a highlighted issue on the country's 
agenda. 
  All newspapers and television channels were covering it in 
one way or the other and it was getting as much attention as the 
PKK. 
  At this juncture, two television newsmen made a crucial 
mistake and literally ended up as scapegoats. 
  On one hand, the country's military was furious at the draft 
dodgers. On the other, they had too many problems to face in 
the Southeast where--despite all the rosy statements--there was 
no observable improvement. And there were the accusations 
against Serdar Gures. 
  Under these circumstances, Turkey's highest level military 
official gave the necessary orders: two newsmen working for the 
popular Anten program on the private television channel HBB were 
arrested for broadcasting interviews on draft evasion. They 
were not only arrested but they were arrested by a military 
court. For the first time since the military coup of 1980, 
which put thousands of people on trial, civilians once again 
faced a military tribunal in Turkey. 
  According to the prosecutor's indictment, producer Erhan 
Akyildiz and reporter Ali Tevfik Berder, had broadcasted 
material that encouraged Turks to evade military service. In 
their documentary on Turkish draft dodgers and deserters from 
the Army, two people interviewed were quoted as saying they were 
against compulsory military service and would not service in the 
military if given the choice. 
  Akyildiz (46) and Berber (34) were arrested and hauled into 
the Mamak military prison, where once thousands of political 
inmates were detained by the military. 
  Arrest warrants were also issued for the two Turks they had 
interviewed. 
  The case took a turn for the worse when the Naval Forces 
Command court turned down an attorney's request for the release 
of the two suspects. 
  Protests in the press started at once and the incident was 
highlighted in the newspapers, magazines and on television 
channels. There were numerous appeals to the President, Suleyman 
Demirel, to intervene on behalf of the newsmen. There was also 
widespread criticism of two civilians being tried at military 
courts. 
  But, as Demirel said later on, this was the law and the law 
did give permission for "crimes" committed against the military 
institution to be judged by military courts--under military laws. 
  Still, Akyildiz and Berber were released at their first 
hearing. The military prosecutor explained that their arrest had 
already served its purpose, possibly meaning: a warning. The 
chief judge, also a military officer, explained to the 
defendants that the prosecutor would not have acted on his own 
initiative but would have filed the case under orders from 
superiors. It was evident where the order had come from. How 
much this ordeal has helped Turkey and encouraged military 
service is yet to be seen, though it appears that instead of one 
single television news report on draft dodging simply losing its 
importance and fading from memory, what happened afterwards has 
eroded the military more than anything else. 
<H5>  Gures Reacts </H5>
  It was inevitable that the debate on how much control the 
Turkish military has on the entire political system should 
resurface. 
  And, accordingly, Gen. Gures spoke out. In his first 
statement, while inspecting Turkish commando forces in western 
Turkey, he reaffirmed that "the armed forces are a guardian of 
democracy... Everything will remain within the boundaries of 
democracy. No one should have doubts about this. Turkey will, 
until eternity, protect its unitarian structure," he said. 
  His most interesting remark, though, was that the military 
was trying to keep out of politics. 
  He also emphasized Turkey's increasing stature in the region 
and the growing importance of the Turkish armed forces. If he 
wanted to get support for this statement, he go it from Ciller 
whose own statement coincided with that of Gures. They are 
working 24 hours a day to protect us, it said. 
  But what actually appeared to stir matters up, was another 
statement Gures made at the end of last week. According to 
sources, this was an unrehearsed speech and reflected the 
personal views of the Chief of Staff. 
  Last Friday, while inspecting troops in Bolu, Gures lashed 
out strongly at those demanding the lifting of the taboos on the 
Turkish Armed Forces, and branded them as dwarfs and miserable 
people. Gures warned that in the "critical days" Turkey was 
passing through, there would be "accusations and attacks" on 
Turkish military commanders. 
  For him, the Turkish Armed Forces were too powerful to be 
"eroded by the vociferous statements of the dwarfs. "These 
miserable people are hiding behind democratic remarks like the 
Turkish Armed Forces is not taboo and hiding their real 
intentions," Gures said. 
  "We are living through critical days but we will overcome 
everything." 
  Saying that the Turkish nation strongly supported the 
struggle of the Turkish military, Gures said, "But from time to 
time, and especially during critical periods, people who are 
vociferous and organizations that are low in figure and dwarfish 
in quantity, can appear and make baseless accusations and 
attacks on military commanders. I am saying we are surprised 
and sorrowed by this." 
  Gures warned that such circles may have taken on a mission 
specifically against the interests of the country and added, 
"Some of those accusing the Turkish Armed Forces want to produce 
ideas without knowing what is happening, while some are after 
showing off and running after cheap heroism. Another group 
which is not aware of the threat is on the same tack." 
  Gures added, however, that these were not the dangerous ones 
and pointed out that "those who are dangerous are people and 
organizations who have taken on duties for special purposes. 
The danger is the terrorist organization, it collaborators and 
its supporters in words and print. Don't worry, the Turkish 
nation is after them." 
<H5>  Serdar Lashes Out </H5>
  Gures's statement was a strong one and met with a strong 
reaction in various quarters. Although a majority of Turkey's 
columnists held back from replying, it was interesting that a 
majority took the threats personally. There was an undeclared 
agreement not to turn the issue into a personal vendetta. 
  Some, however, did push the matter a bit, and there were 
appeals from the bolder columnists for Gures to be relieved from 
duty. There was criticism of his conduct and demands for the 
Turkish democracy to work. 
  Once again, the prestige of the military was being eroded 
from within. 
  And this was not the end of the story. 
  Immediately after his father's reference to the traitors, as 
if he had been waiting for the chance to get even, Serdar spoke 
out as the second-in-line of the Gures family. 
  In an exclusive interview with the Turkish daily MILLIYET, 
conducted in a luxurious 21st floor suite at Istanbul's Harbiye 
Officers' Club hostel, Serdar not only voiced anger at recent 
press reports directed at him but gave his support to his 
father's accusations. 
  He argued that such reports--that he was at the state 
conservatory through his father's influence and was evading 
military service--lowered the morale of Turkish soldiers serving 
their country in the troubled Southeast. 
  He said that those who spread such "rumors" were "traitors" 
who were actually after his father but could not reach him 
directly. 
  He also warned that the press was placing too much pressure 
on him and said, "I could kill a journalist." 
  Serdar, clearly with the courage he received from his 
fathers 
statements, spoke not like an ordinary actor or the draft dodger 
he was accused of being, but as if he was a field marshal. His 
messages were clear: 
  "Traitors are behind the rumors about me..." 
  "The rumors are spread by those who cannot reach my 
father..." "Claims about me are damaging the morale of the 
solders in the east..." 
  "They are pressing me too much. If they go on like this, I 
could shoot a journalist." 
<H5>  The Days Ahead </H5>
  Today, no one truly knows what is in store for Turkey in the 
days ahead, but indications are that the Turkish Armed Forces 
will be on the agenda more than ever. Despite threats and 
warnings, an issue which was barely heard of now has a place 
high on Turkey's list of priorities. 
  Also, many of the country's intellectuals are worried that 
the Turkish democracy, in this era of development, may actually 
be developing towards a secret authoritarianism. 
  The most recent debate has clearly raised questions on the 
country's military apparatus, and the amount of authority it 
enjoys. And there are bound to be more questions in the future. 
  What matters most, however, is for Turkey to get through 
this 
debate without damaging the prestige and morale of its armed 
forces, which is a crucial part of the overall system. 
  Looking at the recent ordeal, it is abundantly clear that 
the 
military has to take more care over this than the civilians. 
  Meanwhile, as part of the democratization drive, there is 
the 
need to lift all taboos on the armed forces even if it requires 
major amendments in the laws, in the constitution, and, most 
important of all, in the position of the Chief of Staff. 
Perhaps, the whole issue is the result of the fact that still, 
in the last decade of the 20th century, the Turkish Chief of 
Staff is not connected to the Ministry of Defence and is only 
"responsible" to the prime minister. What this could mean, we 
have seen thrice in our contemporary history. The last thing we 
need is another example...

  [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has declared that any 
attempt by the Greek Cypriot Administration to advance the 
European Union [EU] membership issue by taking advantage of 
Greece's term presidency will sabotage the intercommunal 
negotiating process, which is scheduled to begin in the coming 
days. 
  Atun issued a written statement in connection with Greece's 
moves to accept the Greek Cypriot Administration as a full EU 
member. In his statement, Atun said that it is the duty of the 
government to again warn the EU members and the UN Secretariat 
General with regard to this irresponsible move on the part of 
Greece and the Greek Cypriot Administration. 
  Atun announced that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
[TRNC] will immediately assess any negative moves by Greece 
during its six-month term presidency and rapidly make all the 
necessary decisions in cooperation with motherland Turkey. Atun 
recalled that the illegal Greek Cypriot Administration does not 
have the authority to speak on behalf of the Turkish Cypriot 
people, to represent them, to conduct negotiations that will be 
binding on them, or to sign agreements on their behalf. The 
TRNC expects EU member countries to prevent Greece from creating 
more impasses by exploiting its term presidency and from further 
complicating the problem, Atun remarked. 
  The UN Secretariat General and Security Council have 
seriously been warned about the Greek and Greek Cypriot moves, 
which undermine the talks and which contradict all previous 
agreements and accepted principles, Atun noted and called on 
these organizations to exert the necessary efforts to avoid 
negative developments.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis has called on 
NATO to support the implementation of President Glavkos 
Kliridhis' proposal to demilitarize Cyprus. In a letter to the 
alliance's Secretary General Manfred Woerner, Mikhailidhis 
points out that implementing the proposal would remove tension 
and the danger of conflagration and create the appropriate 
climate for effective negotiations on the Cyprus issue. 
  The letter also points out the negative Turkish position on 
the confidence-building measures and stresses that the Greek 
Cypriot side's goal remains finding a lasting Cyprus solution 
through negotiation. 
  Mikhailidhis sent his letter on the occasion of the NATO 
summit. He also says that the demilitarization proposal is 
accompanied by the Cypriot Government's willingness to pay for 
an increased UN peacekeeping force, since the main obstacle to a 
lasting and viable solution is the presence of the Turkish 
occupation troops in Cyprus. Mikhailidhis also recalls that the 
UN secretary general, in his latest report to the Security 
Council, stressed that the status quo in Cyprus was imposed 
through the use of force and is being maintained with military 
force. 
  Mikhailidhis asks that his letter be communicated to all the 
NATO member states.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today 
referred to the priorities of the Greek presidency [of the 
European Union, EU]. At the same time, he reiterated that 
Greece does not accept any dialogue over the name of Skopje and 
added that it expects [Macedonian President] Kiro Gligorov to 
give practical proof of relaxing his intransigent positions. 
Among other things, the government spokesman said: 
  [Begin Venizelos recording] We will exercise this presidency 
while bearing in mind the Community's practices and the true 
correlations of forces being formulated within the framework of 
the EU's institutional bodies and while adhering to the goal of 
European integration. 
  Greece has already declared that it expects the Skopje 
government to follow some self-evident and fundamental dictates 
of international law. It expects the removal of national 
emblems that are Greek, an end to hostile and irredentist 
propaganda, and amendment of the preamble as well as Articles 3 
and 49 in the Skopje constitution. I repeat, these are not 
demands by Greece but obligations stemming from international 
law with which every state -- and moreover every UN member -- 
has to comply. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Solveig Rodsgaard: "Message From the Voters"] </F>
  [Text] Local Elections. The strategy for the Folketing 
election should be in place. 
  Local elections are not a Folketing election. Still, so many 
tendencies countrywide can be inferred from how the voters 
expressed themselves on Tuesday [18 November] that these have 
immediately been included in the party leaders' strategic 
considerations preceding the Folketing election. 
  Aside from the two EC referenda, this is the first time in 
almost three years that voters have had the possibility of 
telling politicians what they think. Therefore, the local 
elections can be described as a kind of midway election, not 
least because a change of government, over which the voters had 
no influence, has taken place since the last Folketing election 
in December 1990. 
  The local elections became a remarkable battle between the 
two great blocs, the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal 
Party, between Uffe and Nyrup. The small parties were trampled, 
the somewhat larger ones squeezed. 
  The Liberal Party and Uffe Ellemann-Jensen were the great 
victors in the local elections, having never before achieved 
such success in the urban areas, where the Social Democratic 
Party and the Socialist People's Party previously were the 
dominant parties. The Social Democrats lost more this time in 
comparison to the local and the county council elections of 
1989, but the prime minister's party still did better than 
expected, and relief over the result has made Prime Minister 
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen behave like a winner almost on a par with 
Ellemann-Jensen. The Radical Liberal Party was the only one of 
the small coalition parties that received a reward from the 
voters. On the other hand, the election was a catastrophe for 
the Democratic Center and the Christian People's Party. The 
Conservatives lost, but not by as much as most people had 
expected. The extremist parties, i.e., the Socialist People's 
Party and the Progress Party, also took a hit from the voters. 
<H5>  Election Results </H5>
  One has to be cautious in trying to read the nationwide 
result of the county council election--the election that best 
can be compared with a Folketing election--directly as a 
Folketing election. However, the Social Democratic Party 
received 34.3 percent of the votes compared to 35.4 percent in 
the last county council election, while the Social Democratic 
Party won 37.4 percent of the votes in the landslide at the 
Folketing election in December 1990. 
  The Radicals won 3.9 percent of the votes at the county 
council election on Tuesday, an increase of 0.5 percent compared 
to the last county council election. The Radicals won 3.5 
percent in the Folketing election. The Democratic Center fell 
from 2.5 to 1 percent in the county council election; the 
Christian People's Party from 1.9 to 1.6 percent. In the 
Folketing election the two parties won 5.1 and 2.3 percent 
respectively. 
  The Liberal Party has thundered forth from 17.8 to 27.1 
percent in the last county council election, while it won 15.8 
percent in the Folketing election in 1990. The Conservative 
Party won 12.8 percent compared to 14.5 percent in the last 
county council election and 16 percent in the Folketing 
election. The Progress Party now has 5.1 percent compared to 7 
percent in the last county council election, but the party won 
6.4 percent in the Folketing election. The Socialist People's 
Party has fallen from 10.7 percent to 9.1 percent; the party won 
8.3 percent in the Folketing election. 
<H5>  The Uffe Effect </H5>
  If these numbers are extrapolated to a Folketing election, 
the Democratic Center and the Christian People's Party will have 
dropped out of the Folketing. Occasionally they do so also in 
the opinion polls, but even though they might be able to pass 
the threshold in the upcoming Folketing election, the government 
majority has been lost. The question, however, is whether the 
Liberal Party and Ellemann-Jensen after the Folketing election 
can muster a majority of the Liberal Party, the Conservative 
Party, and the Progress Party. 
  The outcome of the next Folketing election therefore might 
well be that Prime Minister Rasmussen will continue as prime 
minister for a social democratic-radical minority government. 
The Liberal Party and Ellemann-Jensen might do well in the 
election, but might not be able to benefit from it anyway. Most 
voters will be siphoned off from the other nonsocialist parties, 
and there might not be a majority that can designate 
Ellemann-Jensen as prime minister in 1994. 
  It is only fair to say that Ellemann-Jensen is well 
satisfied 
after Tuesday's election. The Liberal Party has now become an 
urban party especially attractive to young voters. However, his 
problem in next year's election campaign will be to maintain the 
Liberal Party's progress when the Social Democratic Party and 
Rasmussen get the Social Democratic Party's election machine 
started up. Even though the Liberal Party might win the 
Folketing election in a landslide, the Folketing election will 
be make-or-break for Ellemann-Jensen. If he does not manage to 
effect a change of government, it will be quite uncertain 
whether or not the Uffe effect can hold on to the Liberal 
Party's new voters if the Liberal Party continues to drag on for 
a few more years in opposition. 
<H5>  The Conservatives </H5>
  The Conservative Party is in a different position than the 
Liberal Party. The Conservatives, of course, also have their 
eyes on the Folketing election. But the most important thing for 
the party is to recover and gain some new voters. If there is no 
change of government in 1994, this will be no catastrophe for 
the new party leadership headed by Hans Engell. The party 
leadership will be able to display the result, but it can easily 
manage several years in opposition without it causing internal 
problems. 
  It will be most important for the Conservatives to maintain 
their close alliance with the Liberal Party. The two parties 
must not let themselves be played against each other; the 
Liberal Party and the Conservative Party must always appear as a 
credible alternative to the existing government. That is why the 
Liberal Party's popularity with the voters might cause anxiety 
for the Conservatives among whom some fear that the Liberal 
Party might be tempted to go it alone when settling with the 
Social Democratic Party. 
<H5>  Government Problems </H5>
  Prime Minister Nyrup Rasmussen apparently also sees himself 
as a winner in the local elections. Of the four governing 
parties, however, it is really only the Radical Left Party that 
is a winner. Among the Radicals, the mood is very high, and 
group leader Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen was almost euphoric as he 
congratulated the radical members of the local administration 
and of the county council: "The gain in the number of seats won 
is nothing but formidable." 
  The radical politicians are clearly in tune with their 
voters. That is why the radical Folketing groups view the local 
election result as a confirmation that the Radicals made the 
right decision when they joined the Nyrup government in January. 
  For the Democratic Center, Tuesday's election was nothing 
less than a catastrophe. The party lost its four county council 
members and almost all its local administration members. In the 
party's traditional stronghold, Gladsaxe, the party lost all of 
its seats in the local administration. The Democratic Center has 
been doing some serious soul-searching since the party joined in 
the government, but now the party has almost gone into a coma. 
Party leader Mimi Jakobsen was on an official visit to the 
Middle East when she received the depressing news. She states 
that she alone is responsible for the party's poor election 
results, but that the Democratic Center will remain in the 
government and that there is no intention to change the party's 
direction. 
  The Democratic Center's obvious problems can also become the 
prime minister's. Prior to the coming Folketing election, the 
Democratic Center will be even more anxious to define their 
position than they have been so far, so that the image of the 
government will sputter more and more. This will delight 
Ellemann-Jensen and increasingly irritate the many Social 
Democratic Folketing members, who would like to see the 
Democratic Center and the Christian People's Party kept out of 
the government. The Democratic Center's group leader Bente 
Juncker, who is at odds with Jakobsen, has announced a more 
aggressive approach. 
  The Christian People's Party also received a jolt from the 
voters, but not as strong as that of the Democratic Center. The 
Christian People's Party is more used to hovering near the 
threshold in the polls. But this will not keep Merethe Due 
Jensen and Inger Stilling Pedersen quiet. 
  Soul-searching is also on the agenda for the Socialist 
People's Party and the Progress Party. The Progress Party 
members have to decide whether or not to draw a more aggressive 
front with the Social Democratic Party in the coming election 
campaign. The Progress Party must take into account that the 
party's policy concerning immigration did not win them any votes 
in the local elections.

  [Excerpt] Finland is reportedly prepared to give the 
western defense alliance, NATO, a positive response to its 
Partnership for Peace initiative. It is expected that on Monday 
[10 January] a NATO summit in Brussels will present a proposal 
on the issue to all the countries involved in the CSCE process, 
including Finland. According to a review prepared at the 
Foreign Ministry in Helsinki, the NATO initiative is in harmony 
with Finland's own foreign policy and security policy aims. The 
ministry is stressing, however, that Finland is not seeking new 
defense or security arrangements. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Finland Should Take Care of </F>
Its Own Nuclear Waste"] 
  [Text] 

  -  In the future, Finland should take care of the 
nuclear waste that is produced in this country. The Ministry of 
Trade and Industry will look into what changes are needed in 
legislation and prior administrative decisions to guarantee 
this. 
  -  As large a part of basic energy needs as possible should 
be supplied by natural gas plus solutions involving new 
technology based on peat, wood, and other domestic energy 
sources. It may be necessary for the state to participate in 
finding another supply source for gas. 
  -  The permit procedure in 
connection with importing electricity will be retained to enable 
the state to supervise the safety and environmental 
acceptability of the imported energy. 
  These three points are new features in the energy policy 
statement the government sent to the parliament on Wednesday [24 
November]. The statement clearly reveals a more positive view of 
natural gas, but it points out that it will not be possible to 
import Norwegian gas to Finland before the beginning of the next 
decade at the earliest. 
  "Nothing new has happened," said Marketing Director Harry 
Anton of Neste. "We are in constant contact with both the Swedes 
and the Norwegians, but there is still no one in Sweden who 
plans to start importing Norwegian gas. A pipeline through 
Sweden is needed to get the Norwegian gas to Finland." 
  Nevertheless, Anton sees the statement as a positive signal 
from the government and hopes it will also be regarded in this 
light in Sweden. The negotiations with Norway are becoming more 
urgent in view of the fact that the Norwegians must eventually 
decide where they are going to build supply pipelines for their 
gas. On the other hand, the Meripori coal power plant and the 
combined power plant that will probably be built in Skoldvik 
will provide new electricity production capacity, giving Finland 
a little more time in the natural gas negotiations, Anton 
pointed out. 
<H5>  Electricity Needs Increase </H5>
  The government's energy policy statement assumes that 
electricity consumption will increase at an annual rate of 2 
percent during the next 10 years. This means Finland will need 
2,000 MW in new production capacity by 2005 and 3,500 MW by 
2010. The need is based on the fact that, in addition to 
increased consumption, old capacity will be phased out. 
  Imported electricity is one alternative in the energy policy 
statement, but the government assumes that it will be imported 
only from countries that observe international environmental 
agreements and safety regulations. 
  In practice, such a decision could eliminate the importation 
of electricity from Russia and the Sosnoviy Bor nuclear power 
plant outside St. Petersburg. However, Finland has an import 
agreement with Russia that will be in effect until 1999, and 
production director Anders Palmgren of Imatran Voima [Finnish 
power-generating company] says it would not be easy to break the 
agreement. Determining who is complying with international 
safety regulations can be difficult, he indicated. 
<H5>  Nuclear Waste Alternative </H5>
  Finland also has an agreement in effect with the Russian 
authorities with regard to nuclear waste from Lovisa, and 
Palmgren sees no reason to break the agreement. Theoretically, 
nuclear waste from Lovisa can be shipped back to Russia as long 
as the power plant is in operation, Palmgren said, but the 
commercial terms are renegotiated every five years. The current 
commercial agreement will be in force for another four years, 
and Palmgren did not think it should be broken. 
  "It is true that we have the alternative of taking care of 
our waste ourselves, we have had that all along," said Palmgren. 
"But the money we now pay to have our waste taken care of and 
processed in Tchelyabinsk also helps the Russians finance the 
cleanup of the area, which suffered heavy radioactive 
contamination in the 1950's." 
  Palmgren thought the government had yielded to outside 
political pressure in formulating its statement. He pointed out 
that it would certainly be possible to provide final underground 
storage for the waste from Lovisa in Finland, but that it would 
be a barbaric way to dispose of it. In this case, usable fuel 
would also be buried while long, medium, and short-lived waste 
would all be mixed together. 
  Therefore, Palmgren feels it is better to send it to Russia 
now that it is also possible for both Imatran Voima and 
Finland's Radiation Safety Center to check that the waste is 
handled properly. 
<H5>  Old Formula </H5>
  In other respects Wednesday's statement repeats the 
government's old formula for the economic management of 
Finland's energy. One element is energy taxes to make energy use 
efficient and achieve the environmental goals that have been 
set, another is a revised program to cut energy use and sector 
agreements on energy-saving measures in industry. 
  The government also wants to increase the use of bioenergy 
and other domestic energy. To promote this goal, increased 
support will be given to research in new technologies applicable 
to gasification plants, among other things. It will become 
easier for small-scale power plants to enter the electricity 
network and the possibility of increased electricity production 
in connection with the cellulose industry will be studied. 
  The government is also stressing the development of energy 
technology and will subsidize export efforts in this area. In 
addition, the electricity market will be deregulated and there 
will be increased competition. Previous emission goals will 
remain in effect in the energy sector, sulfur dioxide emission 
must be cut 80 percent in relation to the 1980 level, nitrogen 
dioxide emission 30 percent, and carbon dioxide emission will be 
checked at the end of the 1990's. 
<H5>  Industry Dissatisfied </H5>
  Industry's Energy Association feels the government's energy 
policy line is still based on empty phrases just as it was after 
the negative decision on nuclear power. Pentti Sierila, the 
association's president, says the government energy statement is 
not in line with the good goals that are presented at the 
beginning of the statement. 
  "The energy policy line that has now been presented is based 
on hopes and comprehensive state subsidies in the belief that 
energy needs can be satisfied through the increased production 
of bioenergy and by implementing the purchase of natural gas 
from Norway," Sierila said in commenting on the statement. 
  He is surprised the government does not say anything about 
the price of energy. He feels the structure and level of energy 
taxes should be reconsidered. 
  "The line that has now been presented will inevitably 
increase the use of fossil fuel and thus make it impossible to 
achieve the environmental emission goals Finland has committed 
itself to internationally," Sierila said. 
<H5>  Greenpeace Approves </H5>
  The environmental organization Greenpeace is pleased with 
Finland's decision to stop exporting nuclear waste to Russia. 
Imatran Voima has shipped highly radioactive nuclear waste from 
Lovisa east of the Urals 11 times. 
  Greenpeace has launched highly visible campaigns against the 
shipment and processing of nuclear waste in various parts of the 
world. Protests have been organized in such countries as 
Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany, and England.

"The Hidden Power Struggle in Labor"] 
  [Text] The opposition within the Labor Party did not 
disappear in 1993. It only became more dangerous. 
  Good election outcomes usually have an immediate effect on 
the opposition within a political party. Large portions 
disappear. Not so with the opposition within the governing 
party. It takes part of the credit for the Storting election 
victory, and since then has established itself as a separate 
organization within the labor movement. This has laid the basis 
for a power struggle that will take place as much outside of, as 
in, the spotlight of the media. 
  On the surface it might appear that SME (Social Democrats 
Against EC) has not accomplished much in the months since its 
establishment. About the only thing the public has seen of the 
organization was its victory in the vote in the Storting just 
before Christmas [a vote for all four EC applicant countries to 
conduct their referendums on the same date]. In view of the fact 
that practically all EC opponents in the Labor Party and in the 
Labor Confederation belong to SME, it might seem strange that we 
hear so little about the organization in these days of summing 
up 1993 politically. 
  It will be very different come this time next year. The SME 
strategists want a low public profile. To them the most 
important thing is avoiding the accusations of promoting 
factionalism for the purpose of undermining the national party 
congress's resolution to vote yes to the EC. As a result, they 
take every opportunity to emphasize that they are working quite 
openly and that they are only concerned with speaking for all 
those EC opponents who voted for the Labor Party in the election. 
  They are so concerned about loyalty that it is almost 
comical. Take a really close look at [Labor Party leader] 
Thorbjorn Jagland and [SME leader] Hallvard Bakke the next time 
they are asked to comment on the handling of the EC issue in the 
Labor Party: They both say there is no disagreement between them 
as far as the rules of the game go. Bakke says that of course he 
respects the party's chosen leaders and program resolutions. 
Jagland says that of course one is allowed to work against EC 
membership as a Labor Party member. 
  But behind these pretty words are hard-as-nails realities. 
Labor leader Jagland is bound to be just as exasperated over the 
SME as the prime minister is. She spoke her mind about its 
activities in the Storting just before Christmas. But Jagland 
cannot express the same sentiment without risking giving the 
impression that he is trying to drive the EC opponents from the 
party. 
  Real conflicts that are swept under the rug do not go away. 
Instead new arenas and single-subject issues are produced that 
can be fought without disturbing the public peace and quiet too 
much. 
  That makes the power struggle more murky. The need for 
political savvy and experience increases. At this point it would 
be difficult to say which of the parties has the better tactical 
skills.

<F P=106> [Christoph Bertram editorial: "Should the Western Alliance </F>
Accept East European States? -- Pro: A NATO That Avoids Its 
Responsibility Toward the East Europeans After the Debacle in 
the Balkans Is Resigning Politically"] 
  [Text] In reality the quarrel about the expansion of the 
Western alliance to the east is not a quarrel about whether NATO 
can and must contribute to safeguarding security in East and 
Central Europe -- this has long been recognized everywhere. Nor 
is it a quarrel about whether the states in this region should 
be accepted as full members into the NATO club immediately. 
Much rather, it is a quarrel about whether or not some of these 
states should be given a clear prospect for this membership even 
now. 
  At the beginning of next week the NATO heads of government 
will decide against clarity in Brussels and, instead, in favor 
of a deliberately vague, deliberately cloudy "Partnership for 
Peace" -- common consultations and common maneuvers, but little 
more. Theo Sommer thinks that this is good and sufficient. I, 
on the other hand, think that this tactic of delays is 
insufficient and even dangerous, because it contradicts the 
interests of Germany, the interests of NATO, and the interests 
of the states in Central and East Europe as well. 
  Germany's interests: In NATO and in the European Union we 
are the country with the most neighbors in the uncertain East. 
For unrest and upheavals, civil war, and migrations of poverty 
there not to endanger stability here we must promote stability 
in the region as much as possible. Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe said in his statement at the turn of the year: "It is in 
our urgent interest that NATO and the European Union, that 
prosperity and democracy do not end at Germany's eastern 
borders." 
  NATO's interests: As a result of the end of the Cold War, 
the Western alliance has lost its actual task -- averting the 
Soviet urge for expansion, and not even Mr. Zhirinovskiy will 
give it back. The Western inability to respond cohesively and 
with determination to the challenges of the first European 
conflict of the new time, the Balkan war, gives little reason 
for the hope that the alliance will react to future massacres in 
East Europe with anything else than with agonizing abstinence. 
To be better equipped against future dangers from the 
disorderly east and southeast of the continent, NATO must expand 
its own zone of stability. "Those who are in it are safe," NATO 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner says, "those who are not in it 
are not safe." 
  Finally, the interests of the East European reform states: 
Even though they have freed themselves from the forced Soviet 
pact of the past, they see themselves increasingly classified by 
Moscow as belonging to the new Russian zone of influence, the 
"near abroad." Some people in the West shrug off their worries 
as emotional exaggeration. However, how disquieted would the 
Germans or British be, if Moscow wanted to order them that they 
must not be members of the Western alliance and if, at the same 
time, it were to increase the size of its army, as announced? 
After the latest Russian elections Estonian President Meri 
called the "partnership program" of the NATO summit a "used-up 
bottle of perfume" -- "nice to look at, but empty." 
  What should be done instead? The successful reform countries 
-- Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic at first, others 
perhaps later -- should receive the promise of the Western 
alliance even now that they will become full members of the 
alliance by the year 2000. The necessary adjustment should be 
carried out in clearly defined stages: renunciation of 
potential territorial claims on neighbors; protection of the 
minorities in the country; adjustment of the armed forces to 
NATO rules; primacy of politics over the armed forces; reliable 
democratic structures; and coordination of foreign and security 
policy with the other NATO partners. As long as these 
conditions have not been fulfilled, a formal security guarantee 
by the NATO states for these countries would have little 
credibility; however, as soon as they have been fulfilled, there 
is no longer any reason to refuse them assistance by the 
alliance. 
  When the NATO chiefs still leave things at vague intentions 
of cooperation with everyone at their NATO summit, this is done 
primarily out of consideration for Boris Yeltsin's Russia. Even 
though last August the Russian president told his Polish 
counterpart Walesa that Russia understands Poland's intention to 
join NATO and that in the long run "such a decision by sovereign 
Poland, which is oriented toward all-European integration, does 
not contradict Russia's interests." However, shortly afterwards 
the Moscow diplomats went into reverse gear. In December 
Yeltsin grumbled that speedy acceptance of the East European 
states into NATO damages Russia's strategic interests. The head 
of Moscow's foreign espionage even said: The expansion of NATO 
"would bring the world's largest military power with its 
gigantic attack potential directly to Russia's borders." And 
today Foreign Minister Kozyrev warns that NATO's expansion to 
the east is grist to Zhirinovskiy's mill. No one can be 
surprised that Russia is reacting hypersensitively. However, P4P 
-- as "Partnership for Peace" is called in NATO jargon -- is no 
meaningful answer to this sensitivity. On the one hand, the 
refusal clearly to promise NATO membership to the East European 
states rather strengthens Russia's claim to its own, exclusive 
zone of influence in the area of the former Soviet Union and the 
Warsaw Pact and does not tone it down. On the other hand, by 
delaying the membership of the East Europeans, the shaping of 
the future relationship between NATO and Russia is being delayed 
as well. 
  After all, a date for accession by the reform countries 
would put pressure on NATO immediately to start and 
institutionalize the strategic dialogue with Russia. The 
expansion of a stability-oriented, no longer anti-Russian NATO 
would not be detrimental at all to the properly understood 
interests of a democratic Russia. On the contrary: According 
to Vaclav Havel, it would be the "approach of a sphere of 
democracy and stability." Moscow's suspicious military as well 
as the new nationalists and neoimperialists are certainly still 
miles and miles away from this insight. However, instead of 
showing them consideration with the help of P4P, NATO should 
make use of the time that it has to do the best possible work to 
convince them: In close cooperation with Moscow, promoting the 
insight that the stability of East and Central Europe is a 
common interest. Without the simultaneous strategic dialogue 
with Moscow, NATO's expansion toward the east could look like an 
isolation of Russia. However, without this expansion toward the 
east, this dialogue will hardly take place. 
  Since NATO shies away from these decisions, it will miss the 
opportunity of making the uncertainties in East Europe more 
masterable by damming them up and making them more predictable 
for all of Europe. However, could instead, as some people hope, 
the European Union become the anchor of stability for East 
Europe? The idea is not so absurd: After all, the European 
Union already constitutes a security community; also without the 
NATO treaty would an attack on a country of the European Union 
be considered as an attack on all other partners and would be 
answered as such. In addition, the Western European Union 
[WEU], which is to develop into the security pillar of the 
European Union, according to the Maastricht treaty, commits the 
partners to providing "all military and other help and support 
that is in their power" in case of an attack on a member state; 
in this it goes even further than the North Atlantic alliance. 
  Thus, should not NATO but the European Union be expanded? 
The best thing would be both, in clear steps. However, whoever 
thinks that the European Union track helps avoid the security 
policy dilemma of NATO expansion, is wrong. In particular 
because the European Union is a security community, the 
acceptance of new members has security policy consequences -- 
not only the desired ones for East Europe, but also undesired 
ones for the European-U.S. relationship. Three renowned experts 
of the U.S. RAND Corporation, the leading security policy think 
tank of the United States, warned in the fall edition of FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS: "A situation in which a country like Germany commits 
itself to assisting Poland within the framework of the WEU but 
not within the framework of NATO, could destroy the Atlantic 
alliance." The United States will not permit new security 
duties to be foisted on itself. Rather, it has to agree 
expressly to them. Therefore, the expansion of the European 
Union is no alternative to expanding the Atlantic alliance. 
  A NATO that avoids its responsibility toward the East 
Europeans after the debacle in the Balkans is resigning 
politically. An alliance that closes itself to the acceptance 
of new members becomes sterile. Whoever hesitates now, when 
NATO would still be able to provide effective supports to 
security in East Europe, might discover in a few years that he 
has not only lost time but has also gambled away the future of 
the Western alliance.

<F P=106> [Theo Sommer editorial: "Should the Western Alliance Accept </F>
East European States? -- Con: The Access to the Western Markets 
and to the European Union Is More Important Than Military 
Integration"] 
  [Text] Apart from a lost battle, there is almost only one 
thing that causes as much suffering: a won battle. It was the 
Duke of Wellington, the victor at Waterloo, who said this after 
the coalition's triumph over Napoleon. 
  For four years the North Atlantic alliance has been in such 
a 
misery of triumph. In 1990, after 40 years of Cold War, it won 
a victory when Soviet Communism and the imperialist system based 
on it collapsed. Since then NATO has had an embarrassing 
problem. Suddenly, it lost the enemy, the frontline, and the 
military assignment. It has almost reached the goal that its 
first secretary general, Lord Ismay, set for it: making itself 
superfluous. Since then it has been looking for a new 
self-understanding, a new reason for existence. 
  First NATO wanted to organize the transition of the East 
European national economies from plan to market -- a stupid 
idea, because it lacked everything for that: technical 
knowledge, the apparatus, and money. Then it tried to act as 
some sort of constantly ready subcontractor of the United 
Nations or the CSCE, which carries out peacekeeping or 
peacemaking missions upon order and provides the infrastructure 
for them -- however, after the depressing experience in the 
former Yugoslavia, the NATO governments are restrained. Since 
spring 1993 the Western alliance has wanted to "project security 
to East Europe" -- however, how this is supposed to be done is 
heatedly disputed in the circle of the 16 members. 
  Full membership of at least the so-called Visegrad states, 
which are impetuously urging for it: Poland, the Czech 
Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary? Possibly also accession 
by Slovenia, Albania, Romania, and the Baltic Republics, which 
would also like to find support in NATO? In addition, the 
inclusion of Belarus, Ukraine -- even Russia, as is suggested by 
former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker? Or a vague 
associated membership? Or not even that but just an even 
vaguer, noncommittal "Partnership for Peace"? 
  This spring FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe strongly 
supported speedy accession by the four Visegrad states. He 
wanted to see himself in the role of the "door opener." His 
justification: "If we do not export stability, we will import 
instability." The allies, however, have meanwhile strongly 
braked the defense minister's zeal. 
  They have done well. There are five reasons that indeed 
speak for prudence and caution. 
  First: The success of NATO had little to do with the text of 
the treaty. The decisive Article 5, according to which any 
attack on one alliance partner is to be considered as an attack 
on all partners, does not entail any specific commitments. The 
alliance members can decide freely which measures they consider 
"necessary." The range of possibilities reaches from a letter of 
condolences to a nuclear strike. Only the military organization 
of NATO guaranteed an immediate, automatic reaction: the common 
supreme command, a logistical system that was able to bring 
supplies from the Atlantic to the battlefield; common strategic 
planning; common planning and financing of the infrastructure 
(sea ports, airports, telecommunications links, reconnaissance 
systems); above all, however, the deployment of troops from many 
member states at the eastern border of the alliance -- which 
meant at some time 7,000 mostly American nuclear weapons on West 
German soil. France has kept away from this military 
organization since 1966, Spain has never joined it -- but both 
could afford this since their protective front -- the FRG -- was 
defended. Does the West really want to shift the old military 
border by 600 km to the east? 
  Second: Which NATO do the East Europeans actually want to 
join -- the paper NATO, like France or Spain? Or the military 
organization of NATO -- with all common points of command, 
planning, and, above all, multinational troops on Polish, Czech, 
Slovak, and Hungarian territory -- including U.S. nuclear 
weapons? If they really feel threatened, they would have to 
desire all that. At the International Bertelsmann Forum at 
Petersberg recently, the Polish prime minister, the Czech prime 
minister, the Hungarian foreign minister, and the Slovak deputy 
foreign minister evaded the answer to this question. Are they 
satisfied with a noncommittal status, like France and Spain, to 
dispel their fears? Then perhaps one need not take these fears 
all too seriously. 
  Third: NATO made a mistake -- which can be explained only 
geopolitically -- when it took in the hostile neighbors Greece 
and Turkey in 1952. More than once the two have been close to 
war; they have often sabotaged the higher purpose of the 
alliance when they tackled each other. Should the alliance now 
acquire a new belt of members, which are either hostile to each 
other (Hungary/Romania) or quarrel about their territory 
(Poland/Lithuania, Poland/Ukraine) or are threatened by internal 
ethnic conflicts (almost all states between the Baltic Sea and 
the Carpatian Mountains)? No: Before a discussion about 
accession is meaningful at all, minority rights should be 
guaranteed everywhere and borders should be declared inviolable. 
  Fourth: The West should beware of creating problems for 
the Russian reformers (and possibly destroying them), by 
shifting the NATO border close to the Russian border without any 
visible necessity. Russia must not be isolated, as long as it 
does not isolate itself through reemerging aggressiveness. It 
must not be isolated as long as it relies on cooperation with 
the West. The West must not pretend that Russia's relapse into 
profound hostility is unavoidable. However, we may say out 
loud: If Zhirinovskiy came to power or if Yeltsin and Kozyrev 
used the need of the 25 million Russians in the "near abroad" 
for protection as an excuse for an aggressive policy toward the 
Baltic states and the former Warsaw Pact states -- then NATO 
would not hesitate to expand toward the east. For this reason, 
the alliance must also preserve what military experts call the 
"regrowth capability": the capability to once again, if need 
be, tailor the shrinking armed forces of the Western alliance to 
a rising threat. Only then, if this threat has been abolished, 
will NATO really be superfluous. 
  Fifth: Currently, the Western alliance is in a deep identity 
crisis. Its foundations -- those of the old relations between 
the United States and Europe -- are swaying, a new relationship 
between the partners on both sides of the Atlantic must still be 
developed. Its overall strategy requires an overall revision. 
Fewer men, less material -- this characterizes the current 
situation. Forty percent of the soldiers and 50 percent of the 
arms arsenal of 1990 will have been abolished next year. So far 
there is no consensus on the future role of the alliance. Who 
would want to add to the structure before the foundations have 
been newly cast? 
  Certainly, NATO is more than a military alliance. However, 
the military alliance is its core: the protective community 
based on mutuality. NATO is not a cultural association and, 
therefore, it should not be used metaphorically to declare 
cultural ties. It must be able to fulfill the guarantees that 
it gives -- and those that benefit from them must, in return, be 
ready and willing to support the others in the protective and 
offensive alliance. Anything else would be not serious, 
unworthy, not credible. 
  Partnership for peace? The concept has a lot that speaks for 
it. Cooperation between NATO and East Europe common staff 
planning, multinational preparation for peacekeeping and 
peacemaking; help in democratizing the Eastern armies; 
incentives to disclose the defense budgets; in addition, the 
future prospect of full membership in NATO, as soon as 
conditions are right -- if such considerations do not pass into 
the realm of limbo anyway. The concept of the partnership for 
peace gives everyone time to think, time to adapt, time to gain 
experience. 
  However, nowadays security no longer means just military 
security. In particular in East Europe security depends less on 
military precautions but rather on functioning market economies 
and intact democratic institutions. Membership in NATO is less 
important than access to the Western markets and organizations, 
such as the European Union. If this access is denied, the 
expansion of the Western alliance to the east could do little to 
let those things grow together in Europe that belong together. 
  Let us take heed of the Duke of Wellington's insight about 
the suffering caused by won battles. But let us not be 
frightened by the manic fear that he revealed in a letter to THE 
TIMES 32 years after Waterloo: It is necessary to strengthen 
defense measures against a French invasion of England. Politics 
must never be guided by chimeras, the nightmares of aging 
generals or excited politicians.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "Dr. Clinton and the Russians"] </F>
  [Text] That Bill Clinton will be visiting four European 
capitals but that he will leave out the FRG has produced some 
grumbling among officials in Bonn. However, the trip does 
symbolize a certain progress. After all, in its first year in 
office, one had the impression that the Clinton administration 
had put the word "Europe" on the index. Whenever foreign policy 
would play more than merely a secondary role, the catchwords 
were "Somalia," "North Korea," "NAFTA" [North America Free Trade 
Agreement], and "GATT." 
  Secretary of State Christopher has articulated with 
impatience and unwillingness that "West Europe is no longer the 
dominating region of the world." Moreover, one was hearing "a 
lot of criticism" from Europe but not "from Asia." 
Unforgettable remains Christopher's blunder in connection with 
Bosnia, which sounded as if he had copied it from Neville 
Chamberlain, the British prime minister of the 1930's. For the 
architect of the Munich agreement, Czechoslovakia was "a faraway 
country of which we know nothing." For Christopher, Bosnia was a 
"humanitarian crisis, far away from home, on another continent." 
<H5>  "Russia First" </H5>
  Official rhetoric has meanwhile changed, and so has 
politics. 
Clinton will visit Europe three times this year, and Christopher 
has given assurance that "Europe is in the center of our 
interest." This is the good part of the news. The less 
flattering part remains unsaid: Not "Europe first" but "Russia 
first" is the hidden motto, even when at the opening of the 
Brussels NATO summit, Vice President Gore once more emphasized 
the classic orthodoxy: "When there is fighting in Europe, we 
are also suffering; when Europe is safe and free, we also 
prosper." 
  However, America's eye remains primarily directed toward 
Russia, and the policy in this connection is called "Partnership 
for Peace," which NATO should give its place this week. The 
intricate draft Made in USA [preceding three words in English] 
reads just like the Bible; everyone can pick out what fits best 
into their concepts. Yet, at the end of the day, two things 
remain indisputable: The Russians must not be upset and, hence, 
the East Europeans not be accepted into NATO. 
  What remains are consolation prizes for the former 
compulsory 
members of the Soviet empire, who now have to hold out in that 
drafty waiting room that used to be called "In-Between-Europe": 
between NATO Germany in the West and Russia in the East. True, 
the alliance intends to offer "interested countries" -- such as 
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and others -- treaties on 
military cooperation, ranging from joint training to exercises 
for peaceful missions. This produces a pleasant modernization 
push for the backward Eastern armies. However, what should the 
"In-Between-Europeans" do with the passage in bold print, that 
says: no security guarantees, no date for membership in the 
alliance? At best, they may "consult" NATO in case they feel 
threatened. Who will blame Polish Foreign Minister Olechowski 
for deriding such "partnership" as a signal to "get lost." 
  Behind that, if one wants, one can see a psychiatric view of 
Western foreign and security policy. The "patient" is Moscow 
and the therapy is called "appeasement and mollification." 
Those who want to shift NATO toward the East had better think 
of the terrible irrational reactions in Russia: paranoia and 
chauvinism, finally the victory of the neofascist and 
neoimperialist forces under the banner of someone like 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  Even if such therapeutical definition of politics -- an old 
Western reflex --is not a compliment for the Russians, Boris 
Yeltsin has now gratefully accepted the signals. While Clinton 
was packing up, Yeltsin once more dramatized what has long since 
been part of the standard repertoire of Russian rhetoric: a 
NATO extension would trigger "a negative reaction from Russian 
society" and a "military-political destabilization" in 
In-Between Europe. 
  One thing is true about this theory, which is also supported 
by Chancellor Kohl: Provocation is no foreign policy -- 
particularly if it might benefit Yeltsin's enemies at home. 
Yet, maybe even this building of premises is becoming shaky. 
First, if we are worried about the Russian reformers, we should 
display the same solicitude toward the East Europeans as well. 
The former Polish defense chief said, "Our main reason to get 
into NATO is to secure democracy. We must force back the same 
nationalists who are also bothering Yeltsin." 
  Second, the therapeutical approach forces the doctor into 
the 
straight jacket. Those who commit themselves to the motto "To 
do anything but provoke them" give the patient a permanent veto 
right against their own policy. Moreover, the partners are thus 
stripped of the incentive of examining reality. Those who 
understand and excuse everything will easily be maneuvered into 
the situation where they blackmail themselves -- which might 
culminate in the point where vital interests are suddenly at 
stake. 
  American -- and also German -- diplomacy toward Russia is, 
thus, running the risk of issuing a blank check and making 
itself a hostage of Yeltsin. A wiser policy would, of course, 
pursue a strategy on three different tracks. On the one track, 
the train would roll toward help and consideration, although one 
must never forget that democracy and the market economy are not 
export hits and that Russia's fate lies in Russia's hands. (It 
only worked in Germany and Japan after 1945 -- albeit under the 
loaded cannons of the occupiers.) 
  The second track is called conditionality: Money only for 
reforms, consideration only for legitimate interests. 
Neoimperialism under the old-new Czarist flag, particularly if 
such imperialism puts its paw on the Baltics and East Europe, 
must no longer count on understanding. In this case, the 
Russian-friendly "Partnership for Peace" would have to transform 
itself into a protective alliance with East Europe, including 
the extension of NATO. Moreover, such a strategy does not 
necessarily have to weaken Yeltsin -- after all, he could then 
refer to the loss of Western confidence and be able to 
exquisitely sober those who pester him at home. 
<H5>  Comfort for "In-Between-Europe" </H5>
  On the third track, the West can make a security-political 
virtue of diplomatic necessity -- that is, not to enlarge NATO. 
After all, the more an alliance is watered down, the more badly 
it will produce security. Although NATO has lost its classic 
function -- defense against a Soviet attack -- it remains an 
indispensable insurance firm. One has to keep the machinery 
well oiled; despite disarmament, the alliance needs the 
capability to quickly restore its potential. Ironically, it is 
particularly this concentrating on the essential thing that 
offers "In-Between-Europe" the best comfort. Even someone like 
Zhirinovskiy will think twice before he plays with fire when he 
knows that the there are well-trained firemen on the other side. 
  We must help the Russians, even in our own interest. Only, 
confidence is good, but insurance is better.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Gerd Brueggemann: "Search for Orientation"] </F>
  [Text] When U.S. President Bill Clinton begins his first 
foreign policy trip to Europe -- almost one year after he came 
to office -- the course of his stopovers is clear: the NATO 
summit in Brussels, Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, and Prague, where 
he is scheduled to meet the heads of state and government of 
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Unfortunately, the 
political course that the President intends to pursue is not as 
obvious. 
  A few days before Air Force One starts the flight across the 
Atlantic, hectic activities can be observed in Washington, 
which, in numerous background talks, is trying to give the 
impression that the various and often disparate elements of U.S. 
European policy all serve one purpose -- to imbue new contents 
to the alliance after the end of the Cold War, encourage the 
reform policy in the countries of the former East Bloc, and open 
to them the paths to the community of Western states. For this 
purpose, the White House devised a plan intended to concentrate 
the conflicting interests in Europe under the name of 
"Partnership for Peace." 
  The "partnership" is intended to facilitate cooperation 
between the former Warsaw Pact members and NATO without 
extending to them the alliance's security guarantee. In Warsaw, 
Budapest, and Prague, it was, thus, described as a plan whose 
most important task is to deny them speedy membership, not least 
to enable Clinton to assure the Russian president that NATO was 
not intending to isolate Russia. Clinton said that "we want to 
avoid the impression that we are creating a new dividing line in 
Europe after having worked for decades to eliminate the old one." 
  Such arguments can also be heard in a similar form from 
Moscow. It is no coincidence. The congruence makes it clear 
that the Clinton administration is obviously determined to 
concede the highest priority to promoting the democratic 
developments in Russia in its European policy -- also out of 
security considerations. The Americans believe that accepting 
the three former communist countries into NATO would threaten 
the Russian reform process. It was particularly Polish 
President Lech Walesa who strongly warned against such a view. 
It might rather contribute to destabilize the situation in his 
country and in the other young democracies and to expose them to 
Russian pressure for hegemony. Yet, Clinton obviously thinks 
that this risk is acceptable and intends to elaborate on his 
position during his meeting with the politicians of these 
countries in Prague, a position which, he said, was 
"misunderstood" in East Europe. 
  The American position is biased in favor of Russia without 
an 
appropriate counterweight. Many of its critics at home, 
including, among others, Robert Zoellick, who served as 
undersecretary in the State Department in the Bush 
administration, are convinced that the persuasiveness and the 
credibility of this policy would be greater even vis-a-vis 
Moscow if the "Partnership for Peace" plan were to contain a set 
of firm criteria and a schedule for accepting new members to 
NATO instead of a rather vague offer for cooperation. 
  At the moment, America's economic policy toward the former 
Soviet empire appears similarly unbalanced and leaning toward 
Russia. While, after the collapse of the communist-controlled 
economies, there was wide agreement among Western governments 
that only a resolute implementation of reforms based on the 
market economy could create the basis for economic recovery, 
Washington recently expressed its doubts about whether such a 
policy is correct. Under the impact of the result of the 
Russian election of December, which brought considerable gains 
to antireform forces, Clinton's leading Russia strategist, 
Strobe Talbott, announced the necessity of a slower reform pace 
to undermine the basis for the demagogic arguments of the 
reactionary forces. 
  Talbott, who has since been nominated by Clinton as deputy 
secretary of state, said that the "shock therapy," which has so 
far been pursued, has proved a failure; more therapy and less 
shock will be necessary in the future. One may now well discuss 
whether the policy that has so far been applied was applied in 
the right doses, but the assumption that the pace of reform was 
too high puts the actual facts upside down. The White House has 
obviously also realized that and initiated attempts for a 
retreat. One spokesman said that Talbott was misinterpreted, 
but he failed to deliver the appropriate interpretation. 
  What remains is the impression of a certain confusion in 
America's East European policy. Out of fear of a setback for 
the democratic development in Russia, it evades to orient itself 
by clear principles and, instead, is guided by the short-term 
aspects of day-to-day politics.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial report] At 2050 GMT on 9 January 1994 Cologne 
RTL-Plus Television Network in German in its "Spiegel TV" 
magazine program carries an unattributed 15-minute report on 
Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, nicknamed Adolfovich because of 
his Hitlerite views. 
  The report begins with clips in Zhirinovskiy's 47th birthday 
in Moscow recently, where he received Gerhard Frey, chairman of 
the German People's Union, and Iraqi ambassador to Russia Gafil 
Husayn, who wished him well. The reporter notes that 
Zhirinovskiy and Iraq's Saddam Husayn are comrades because of 
their "joint hatred for the Jews." 
  The report then flashes back to the time after the putsch 
against Gorbachev. At a meeting in the Kremlin in September 
1991, Zhirinovskiy is shown engaging in "political forecasts": 
"There will be only one unified Russia; no autonomous 
republics. The bolsheviks have experimented. This has failed. 
Now come the democrats. This will fail, too. And then I will 
come." 
  At some unidentified outdoor rally, Zhirinovskiy is seen 
speaking to a crowd of people: "I reach my hands out for the 
nuclear weapons. I will put an end to Russia's humiliation. 
Our Army will stay there, and not one single Georgian combat 
plane will ever again shoot down a Russian pilot. No gang of 
Afghans will ever again violate the border again. Not one 
single kilogram of Russian goods will ever again be stolen. No 
one will harm even one hair on a Russian's head. Then they will 
feel what Russia is. But those guys in the Kremlin are just 
dragging themselves, groaning and panting, from the buffet to 
the toilet. That is all that they are still able to do. When 
Moldovan bandits saw a Russian to pieces with a chainsaw, I will 
destroy their industry -- quite simple. And when in Kyrgyzstan 
a Russian is torn apart by two horses, I will destroy the entire 
region." 
  An unidentified officer in the crowd speaks up, holding out 
his right arm in the fascist salute: "Vladimir Volfovich, we 
officers support you." 
  There follow clips on interviews with people in the street, 
who all support Zhirinovskiy: "Zhirinovskiy is great, much 
better than Yeltsin. He defends Russia. He stops the sell-out 
of the nation." "He speaks very well, above all soberly." "He 
describes everything correctly. The nation is being oppressed, 
our nation." 
  The reporter notes that Zhirinovskiy supported the "putsch 
of 
the Stalinist nomenklatura against Gorbachev." Zhirinovskiy is 
shown commenting on the putsch: "There should not have made so 
many telephone calls; they should simply have shot everyone 
involved in the sabotage. When Russia's interior minister did 
not follow orders, the officers should have liquidated him 
within five minutes. Just as with Pinochet: Shoot a few 
officers, and the putsch would have been successful. A few 
combat helicopters should have bombed the White House to rubble, 
and the entire gang should have been arrested. Everything is 
rotten. All generals are senile. They are incompetent. That 
is why they lost. It could have worked, and then this would 
have been a different country here -- a powerful USSR." 
  The report then continues with film clips on Zhirinovskiy 
showing his bodyguards his former headquarters in the Moscow 
hotel. Explaining the uniforms his bodyguards wear, closely 
modeled on German uniforms during the Third Reich, Zhirinovskiy 
notes: "We have meanwhile become a powerful organization, and 
the boys wanted a uniform. This commits them to our cause and 
they feel like full party members." 
  Zhirinovskiy says that he will make sure that a memorial 
plaque is mounted in the room where his party headquarters was 
located during the presidential elections. 
  In the new party headquarters in Moscow's "Fishmonger's 
Lane," guards wear "contemporary" German uniforms. The building 
also houses the party's youth organization. Its head, V. 
Akhimov, says: "Our party developed practically out of nothing 
in very turbulent times. We have won thousands of followers 
virtually overnight, just as Hitler's party did in the past. 
It, too, won its followers before it came to power. The second 
common point: Hitler came to power legally, through elections. 
We, too. Our party is legal. Therefore, we will come to power 
in line with the Constitution. Third, Hitler pursued a tough 
national policy. He did a lot of good for the Germans. Today 
we are pursuing the same policy, but here in our country. We 
want Russians to be well off in Russia." 
  The reporter notes that "for this purpose, firm friendships 
abroad are also needed. Russia's Hitler feels particularly 
comfortable with Iraqi dictator Saddam Husayn." Zhirinovskiy is 
shown pointing at a world map and saying: "Our Arab friends are 
our most reliable partners. And here you see Europe. We fought 
against the Finnish, the Swedish, the Poles, the Hungarians, and 
the Romanians. The only really consistently reliable partner is 
Germany." 
  Then follow film clips of a festive event organized during 
Gerhard Frey's recent visit to Moscow. Toasting Zhirinovskiy, 
Frey says: "We want you to become the leader of strong, large, 
just, and rich Russia. Together with millions of Russians, we 
see you as Russia's hope. In this spirit, I drink to our 
personal friendship and to the eternal and inseparable 
friendship of our peoples. Long live Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
long live Russia." 
  Zhirinovskiy, for his part, says: "I would like to add that, 
to implement our plans, we need German precision and the courage 
of the Russian people. In the Middle Ages [as heard] in Germany 
there was an attempt to establish a new order in Europe. This 
did not work out. And in Moscow there was an attempt to 
establish a new order at the end of the century. This did not 
work, either. To German Prussia and to Russian Alaska." 
  The reporter then notes that, despite Zhirinovsky's heavy 
drinking, he, together with a uniformed delegation, was invited 
to Baghdad. "After all, Russians and Iraqis have a common 
enemy," the reporter says. 
  In Baghdad, Zhirinovskiy is shown saying: "Everywhere there 
is war, there are Americans. Wherever there are diseases, they 
come from the United States --AIDS, drunkenness, moral decline 
-- everything comes from the United States." 
  The youth organization is not so happy about this enemy 
image. V. Akhimov says: "Actually, I do not want to wage war 
against the United States, because both countries have the same, 
threatening problems -- our government, our press, science, and 
arts are very deeply permeated by Jews, and this also applies to 
the United States. I do not understand that -- as if there were 
no talented, intelligent, educated people among the Russians. 
Of course, they exist. However, again and again, one is 
confronted with the following situation: A Russian employs 
everyone who can work in his company. A Jew, however, always 
only takes a Jew." 
  Then Zhirinovskiy is shown speaking at some rally: "As a 
result of World War I, the rule of the Zionists developed. They 
intended to take over world leadership. However, they 
miscalculated. They thought: After Lenin comes Trotsky -- and 
he agreed to it, too. However, thanks to the communist 
revolution, that did not work. Then they planned World War II, 
the invasion of Poland and Czechoslovakia. All this was planned 
by Zionists. They thought that they would also be able to oust 
the regime in our country. However, they miscalculated, in 
particular as regards Russia. Everywhere they ousted 
governments. They forced Germany to its knees and had a firm 
grip on the country. And today Germany is no longer a danger to 
us." 
  The reporter notes that, "in contrast to the group of old 
communists and also in contrast to Gorbachev and Yeltsin, the 
uninhibited populist is looking for contact with the people." 
Zhirinovskiy is shown walking through a street, talking to 
people, including a cripple sitting on the ground. 
  According to the reporter, "Zhirinovskiy is demagogically 
exploiting mass fears of humiliation, fear of unemployment, 
poverty, and crime." He says: "You will be even worse off when 
you vote for the wrong people again. None of these parties will 
save you. They are all too small for that. Today only a 
government of personal power can still save the situation. The 
former state -- despite its big disadvantages -- at least 
produced the most powerful weapons in the world: nuclear, 
chemical, bacteriological, and space weapons. Everyone was 
afraid of us. This was a positive foreign policy factor. 
People are afraid -- thus, one is respected. The entire world 
is based on this principle." 
  Zhirinovskiy and his people are again attending communist 
demonstrations. During one of these rallies, the reporter and 
his camera team ask some of the demonstrators why they are here. 
The people are extremely hostile toward the reporters and do 
not want to be filmed. Many revile them as Jews. 
  The report concludes with clips of Zhirinovskiy's birthday 
party. Regarding Zhirinovskiy's future plans, the reporter notes 
that at the first meeting of the newly elected parliament, 
Zhirinovskiy plans to put forward a motion for an immediate 
amnesty of all the 1991 and October 1993 putschists. 
  This report is followed by a 10-minute report by Thomas 
Amman 
and Mark Brasse on Zhirinovskiy's "Greater German friends." The 
report begins with clips of the search of the T.V.O. company 
offices on 6 January, a former cover firm for the Socialist 
Unity Party (SED) in Berlin, where material was found proving 
that millions of German marks in SED property were illegally 
transferred abroad after the upheaval in the GDR. Josef 
Dierdorf of the Trust Agency notes that 4 million German marks 
were transferred to some unknown place via the T.V.O. The money 
seems to have ended up in secret accounts in East Europe. 
According to the reporter, the main suspect is West Berlin 
entrepreneur Werner Girke, who "discretely administered the 
communists' assets abroad in GDR times." 
  Girke's impounded documents also show that he is reportedly 
dealing with Russian neofascist Zhirinovskiy. Dierdorf notes 
that "there are corresponding statements that one of Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy's associates spent up to six weeks here at the 
T.V.O. last summer and autumn and cultivated intensive contacts 
there." 
  Then follow clips on Zhirinovskiy's meeting with DVU 
Chairman 
Gerhard Frey in Munich last December. Frey welcomes him by 
saying: "Welcome! We are all happy to see you. Wonderful! A 
wonderful victory, a great victory, fantastic. Congratulations!" 
  The report continues with footage on Zhirinovskiy's visit to 
Austria. At Vienna's Schwechat Airport he says: "Today there 
are many industrialists in West Europe that I would like to 
meet. One must research economic problems more thoroughly. This 
is the most important thing now. Today I am just coming from 
Germany. Soon I want to go to Australia, perhaps also to Zurich 
for a change." 
  In Austria, Zhirinovskiy is accompanied by his financial 
adviser Aleksey Videnkin, the man who stayed with Girke last 
year, according to the reporter. Zhirinovskiy was invited to 
Austria by Carinthian industrialist Edwin Neuwirth. 
  From the Austrian Animal Protection Society, Zhirinovskiy 
receives a cable that is read by one of his aides: "Dear Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy. If Alaska is included in the Russian Empire, we 
request that you make sure the local wildlife, in particular 
grizzlies and seals, are protected. Thank you on behalf of the 
Austrian Animal Protection Society. Anton (Zadik)." 
  In Austria, Zhirinovskiy also met with a number of European 
businessmen. Regarding these meetings, Edwin Neuwirth says: 
"When businessmen learned that he was visiting me, some people 
from Slovenia and Croatia come -- not from Serbia, as was 
reported. There was not a single Serb here. There were some 
from Bulgaria, etc. These people knew him from past business 
dealings. Thus, they discussed various things." Neuwirth 
claims that he does not know what was discussed. When asked by 
the reporter whether any businessmen from Germany were there, he 
says "no" after hesitating for a fraction of a second. 
  The report notes that Zhirinovskiy and his troops were 
attentively watched "by a dozen plainclothes investigators from 
an antiterrorism unit of the Austrian State Police." When 
Michael Sika, director general of public security, is asked 
whether he knows whom Zhirinovskiy met, he says yes, the State 
Police knows, but he refuses to comment on any details. 
  The reporter says that the journalists who were present did 
not get to see any of the visiting businessmen, only 
Zhirinovskiy, his bodyguards, and a certain Svetoslav Stoilov, a 
Bulgarian exile who is Zhirinovskiy's liaison in Vienna. 
  Journalist Hannes Reichmann says: "An entrepreneurs' summit 
took place. Entrepreneurs -- I put it cautiously, let us say 
ambiguous entrepreneurs -- from all over Europe met here, who 
already expect that Mr. Zhirinovskiy will soon become president. 
I quote Stoilov, who said that it will take only four to five 
months until Mr. Zhirinovskiy is president. He was unable to 
explain how this would take place, but is convinced that it will 
happen." 
  When Zhirinovskiy wanted to visit Germany again on 29 
December, he was refused an entry visa. According to Neuwirth, 
he had been invited by Werner Girke and his associates, who did 
not even know that Zhirinovskiy would not be permitted to enter 
but learned about this matter only when Neuwirth told them. 
  Foreign Minister Kinkel is asked about the entry ban and the 
conditions under which he would be willing to receive 
Zhirinovskiy. Kinkel says: "I refused to let Mr. Zhirinovskiy 
enter the country. However, at the same time I stated that in 
the future the matter will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis 
as to whether or not he will be permitted to enter. I do not 
want to speculate on such questions. I do not intend to give a 
theoretical answer." Kinkel also refuses to comment on 
Zhirinovskiy's activities in Austria, because he does not want 
to "interfere in other countries' internal affairs." He also 
claims not to know that Zhirinovskiy met with German businessmen 
in Austria and says that, if this is true, this is the 
businessmen's business. 
  The report concludes by noting that it is not yet entirely 
clear what kind of business Girke has had with Zhirinovskiy. 
Reportedly, the last time he transferred money to Moscow was on 
30 December.

<F P=106> [Andreas Foerster report: "`Swissified' Money From Dark </F>
Channels"] 
  [Text] The "Zhirinovskiy File" at the Federal Intelligence 
Office [BND] is growing and growing. The Pullach office has 
been investigating links between the Russian nationalist leader 
and German companies since the end of December. 
  One of the bases are photographs the Austrian State Police 
has made available to the BND. On 22 December an official of 
the Vienna Interior Ministry, camouflaged as a skier by wearing 
a ski cap, took photos of the group of entrepreneurs who visited 
Zhirinovskiy in the Carinthian hotel "Rainsberg" in Reichenfels. 
"We had businessmen from Austria, Germany, Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia here," Edwin Neuwirth, 
owner of the "Rainsberg" hotel and Zhirinovskiy's host said. 
<H5>  German Businessmen Visited </H5>
  Limousines with German license plates also arrived in 
Reichenfels. One of them let out Berlin businessmen Werner 
Girke and Werner Neumann. According to the trade registry, 
their company, the Trustee, Administration, and Organization 
Company (T.V.O.) in Kaiserin-Augusta Allee in Tiergarten, is 
dealing with trusteeship deals of all kinds as well as the 
acquisition of companies. 
  In fact, however, until May 1990 T.V.O. belonged to the 
Swiss 
holding ORVAG AG, which has multiplied and administered the 
foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] in 
Switzerland and Liechtenstein since 1970. Together with the 
Liechtenstein Corefina company in Balzers, ORVAG established a 
complicated empire of companies comprised of at least nine 
financial and real estate companies. As trustee of the 
"Swissified" SED assets, strings were pulled by the same Werner 
Girke who has visited Zhirinovskiy. 
  As early as 1990, Girke may have made sure that he need not 
face his new friend Zhirinovskiy with empty hands. 
<H5>  Million-Mark Loans to Unknown Persons </H5>
  BERLINER ZEITUNG has obtained evidence of a transfer of 1 
million German marks [DM] to a Swiss numbered account that was 
carried out by Girke. On 22 March 1990 this sum was transferred 
from the Corefina account at the Zurich Leu Bank to the Leumi le 
Israel Bank in Zurich. Some days later Girke sent another 
DM1.7753 million to three Luxembourg banks. As a reason for 
payment Girke always cited loans, the recipients of which 
remained unknown, however. 
  Still, this was not the only smuggling of money that the 
former SED trustee initiated. At the end of 1993, DM14.2 
million were seized from cover accounts in Luxembourg. Girke 
had received the money in cash at the beginning of 1990 from Mr. 
Langnitschke, the former financial administrator of the Party of 
Democratic Socialism [PDS]. 
  PDS Treasurer Dietmar Bartsch has denied any ties between 
his 
party and Girke and his companies. There are no financial and 
ideological interlacements, he says. 
  An investigator of the Austrian State Police told 
WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE published in Vienna today, that Zhirinovskiy's 
financial adviser Aleksey Vedenkin "is establishing cover firms 
in West Europe and looking for partners so that he can fully 
participate in the oil trade." Zhirinovskiy's confidante 
Neuwirth even says that "Vedenkin has already established 10 
companies in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and in 
Switzerland." 
  Yesterday no one at T.V.O. -- which, by the way, had invited 
Zhirinovskiy for his failed visit to Berlin in December -- was 
willing to tell us anything. In the Federal Interior Ministry, 
too, everything was quiet. The question about Zhirinovskiy's 
contacts with German companies touches on "an intelligence 
service background; therefore, the Federal Government will not 
give any information," the Ministry's press office stated.

  [Text] Bonn, 6 Jan -- The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
has reacted with massive attacks to Moscow's demand not to 
extend NATO to the East. What President Boris Yeltsin and 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev have said is "potentially 
imperialistic," said CDU foreign policy spokesman Karl Lamers on 
6 January. He called upon the West, and above all Germany, "to 
show" Russia that one could not only be a partner, but "also an 
opponent." 
  Lamers accused Yeltsin and Kozyrev of exerting political and 
economic pressure on Russia's neighbor states and of using its 
armed forces for "intimidation" in some cases, such as the 
Baltics and the Caucasus. Moscow was only interested in 
"ensuring maximum influence," said Lamers. To prevent the West 
from extending NATO to the Russian border, the Russian 
leadership was using "the West's concerns" about a new Russian 
imperialism "as an instrument," said Lamers a few days prior to 
the NATO summit in Brussels on 10 January, which will discuss a 
possible opening up of the alliance to the East.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- The restrictive German 
provisions on the export of arms and military material cannot be 
adhered to in the long-term, according to Friedrich Bohl, chief 
of the Federal Chancellery. He said today on Hesse radio that 
Germany could not avoid concessions within the framework of EU 
[European Union] harmonization. 
  It was "completely unrealistic" to imagine that European 
partners would endorse the German Government's political 
principles on arms exports drawn up in 1982. Within the EU, 
sensible compromises would therefore have to be achieved that 
were in line with moral considerations and took account of 
international obligations, Bohl said. But there was no question 
of this opening the door to unrestricted arms exports, he said.

  [Text] Lausanne, Switzerland, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Swiss Justice 
Minister Arnold Koller accused France Friday [7 January] of 
setting back the fight against terrorism by refusing to 
extradite to Switzerland two Iranians suspected of murder. 
  Koller said he was "disappointed and angry" about the French 
decision to deport to Iran two men sought in connection with the 
1990 murder near Geneva of the brother of an Iranian opposition 
leader. 
  In an interview with the Lausanne newspaper NOUVEAU 
QUOTIDIEN, Koller contradicted a statement by the French 
European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure that Switzerland was 
informed ahead of the expulsion of the two men on December 29. 
  Describing Lamassoure's remarks as "completely 
incomprehensible," Koller reiterated that the decision came as a 
surprise to the Swiss "who received no warning at all." 
  Koller said at the time of the expulsion of the suspects, 
Mohsen Sharif Esfahani and Ahmad Taheri Khormabadi, Swiss police 
were ready to take them into custody for their alleged 
involvement of the murder of Kazem Radjavi, brother of Massud 
Radjavi, leader of the People's Mujahidin, an armed group 
opposed to the Iranian Government. 
  "The European system of justice is good," he said, "But it 
is 
necessary for it to be applied." 
  France's attitude to the case was "regrettable," he added. 
  "It is a question of solidarity between countries in the 
fight against terrorism," he said, adding the fight should not 
be abandoned even if this posed a increased risk to officials 
and the public. 
  Koller said he hoped this case would be an exception and 
urged other countries not to follow the French example, saying 
it would "compromise the fight against terrorism." 
  He pointed out that despite "Iranian threats," Switzerland 
had extradited to France two Iranians suspected of involvement 
in the assassination of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpur 
Bakhtiar. 
  Evoking national security as a reason not to prosecute 
terrorists could be justified in cases where there was a 
considerable threat to public safety, Koller said, but he 
insisted that it was better to confront terrorists. 
  The office of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has 
said 
that France had opted "for reasons of national interest" to 
expel rather than extradite the men. 
  The Swiss Government is to discuss the issue at a meeting 
next week but Koller said "it would not help anyone" for 
Switzerland to take action against the French decision.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "French-Iranian Deal Preceded Release </F>
of Two Iranians Accused of Assassinating Rajavi"] 
  [Excerpt] Paris, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Paris 
sources said yesterday that France had agreed to release two 
Iranians accused of committing terrorist acts in return for 
Iranian promises including reduction of Tehran's aid to armed 
groups in Algeria. 
  The French Government has maintained silence about the 
matter 
but French and Iranian sources claim that the sudden step was a 
result of negotiations held in Tehran by French Foreign Ministry 
Secretary General Serge Boidevaix last fall. 
  The sources said that France requested and got the following 
three concessions from Iran: 
  1. That Tehran will not encourage acts of violence on French 
territory nor against French interests abroad for a period 
extending at least until the French presidential election date 
in May 1995. 
  2. That Tehran will undertake to considerably reduce its 
aid, particularly financial and military aid, to the Algerian 
"Afghans." 
  3. That Tehran will agree to bring to trial four Iranians 
accused of killing Shahpur Bakhtiar, the last Iranian prime 
minister under the Shah, in 1991. Saud Hindi Zadeh, Khomeyni's 
nephew, is one of those who will stand trial later this month. 
  The two released Iranians are Mohsen Sharif Esfahani and 
Ahmad Taheri Khormabadi. They are believed to be senior 
officers in the Iranian security organ Savama. They were 
accused of planning to kill Kazem Rajavi, the Iranian leader 
opposed to the mullas who lived abroad, in 1991 in Geneva.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
Franz-Olivier Giesbert -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Giesbert] First there is this 
matter of the Iranians who were expelled. On 31 January, the 
government decided to send back to Tehran two people suspected 
of terrorism, no doubt to avoid possible reprisals. For a 
government which wants to terrorize the terrorists this is not 
very brave. 
  [Juppe] Everything has already been said about this matter 
-- 
the interior minister explained on television under what 
circumstances he proposed to the prime minister that this 
decision be made, and the prime minister thus made this decision 
for the reasons he gave himself. 
  [Giesbert] Yes, but we do not understand the reasons. 
  [Juppe] They were quite clearly explained, it was for 
reasons 
of state. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] When the Swiss minister, Arnold Koller [head of 
Department of Justice], says that France has lost some of its 
credibility in the fight against terrorism, should one not admit 
that he is right ? 
  [Juppe] I do not think that Switzerland's credibility in 
this 
field is much greater than that of France, and in any case, 
combatting terrorism is not a matter of keeping on one's 
national territory those who organize terrorism. [passage 
omitted] The government's determination not to give in to 
anyone, the determination of [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua, 
in particular, to ensure that France is not a rear base for 
international terrorism can not be doubted, and furthermore we 
have shown this on several occasions with action against the PKK 
-- the extremist Kurdish party -- and the FIS [Algerian Islamic 
Salvation Front]. This takes great courage and great 
organization on the part of the government. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] The other matter, which is much more important, 
is, of course, the appalling Bosnian tragedy. Yesterday, a 
further five peacekeepers were injured in Sarajevo. Does this 
not show that General Cot is right when he says that our 
peacekeeping soldiers are tethered goats waiting to be killed? 
  [Juppe] I will leave the responsibility for this expression 
with him, because I believe that our soldiers on the ground are 
doing an admirable job. Having said this, General Cot is right 
that the situation on the ground is untenable today, and the 
tragic thing in this matter is that, despite all the efforts we 
have made, no peace process has begun. What is in the process 
of beginning today is a process of war, as all the protagonists 
on the ground, and I mean all the protagonists, today want, and 
are seeking, war. [passage omitted] If we do not break this 
process of war then we are heading for an unprecedented 
catastrophe. [passage omitted] People have to know that we can 
not make peace among people who systematically seek war. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Juppe, you have just said to us that the 
situation is untenable, so what can be done? 
  [Juppe] What are we trying to do? I repeat, to break out of 
this spiral of war and violence. [passage omitted] If this 
spiral continues, what will happen? First, all the UN 
Protection Forces, our soldiers, our blue helmets, will be 
increasingly exposed, as we saw again yesterday, and the logical 
consequence of all that is that at some point or other -- and 
this is an argument which has already arisen in certain 
countries that have sent peacekeepers to the spot -- we will be 
led to withdraw them, and if we withdraw them, Sarajevo will 
fall, and a disaster, an unprecedented explosion of warfare will 
take place in the heart of Europe, in the Balkans. So, this 
must be stopped, and this is why we want the NATO summit on 
Monday and Tuesday to take a strong position. I have heard 
people saying here and there that we were making an appeal to 
the Americans.... 
  [Giesbert interrupts] Yes, we are throwing ourselves at the 
Americans, are we not? 
  [Juppe] Let me laugh when I hear that, let me laugh. Can you 
imagine for 30 seconds that on Monday and Tuesday the 16 member 
countries of the Atlantic Alliance -- the Americans, but also 
the Germans, the British and the French -- will meet in Brussels 
to discuss the stability of the European continent without 
saying a word about the situation in former Yugoslavia? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Giesbert] This matter concerns Europe, above all, and 
Europe 
is not doing anything. 
  [Juppe] This matter concerns all those who are involved with 
the security of Europe. [passage omitted] I am trying to bring 
about progress, and I can not allow it to be said that Europe is 
not doing anything -- Europe has thousands of soldiers on the 
ground, and several have died or have been injured; Europe is 
sending hundreds of millions of dollars to fund humanitarian 
aid; Europe has not ceased taking political initiatives over the 
last few months. [passage omitted] 
  [Juppe] I want to talk about what we will try to do on 
Monday 
and Tuesday, but first please recall that there is a political 
plan to attempt to find a way out of the current situation, and 
it is the European Union which has put this political plan on 
the table. [passage omitted] The second thing that has to be 
done is for the 16 countries of the Atlantic Alliance to declare 
themselves ready, if this peace plan is signed, to guarantee its 
implementation on the ground, by developing an adequate ground 
force; and third, the countries of the Atlantic Alliance must 
say that they are ready to help the United Nations in applying 
the resolutions of the Security Council, which means reinforcing 
the ground forces, the troops on the ground, and also real 
protection of the security zones. In particular France also... 
  [Giesbert interrupts] [words indistinct] 
  [Juppe continues] Excuse me, but this is very important, 
because there are people dying there -- no one will be dying in 
Brussels, at least I hope not -- and France's additional 
proposal is to reopen Tuzla airport, which is at the heart of 
central Bosnia, so that humanitarian aid can be brought in there. 
  In Brussels, as you mentioned just now, we are going to talk 
first of all about the European defense identity, the adaptation 
of NATO to its new missions, notably to what is happening in 
Yugoslavia, and finally its extension to include countries of 
the East. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Good Day.

  [Text] Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who was visiting

some people for strong intervention in Bosnia. Francois Leotard 
wished that those who give advice to think first, particularly 
Abbe Pierre, to whom he said: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] Everybody understands that there 
is 
no military solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I have a lot of 
respect for Abbe Pierre. I cannot recall him being closely 
associated in recent months with any military decision that 
should be taken regarding this matter. Once more, all those who 
express themselves should think of not undermining either the 
morale or the action of our soldiers on the ground. One should 
be very careful. When we find ourselves in a crisis situation, 
youngsters, officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers 
are carrying out a difficult mission risking their lives. Every 
word should be weighed. I am not sure this has been the case 
during the last few weeks with civilians. We have to be very 
careful. We are engaged in sensitive operations. Let's not 
undermine either the morale or the missions our soldiers are 
asked to carry out. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Alberto Miguez report: "Spain Will Establish Relations with </F>
Macedonia in July"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Spanish Government is determined to 
give the Greek Government a "period of grace" to negotiate an 
agreement over the next six months with the "former Yugoslav 
republic of Macedonia" -- the name under which the new Balkan 
state is known at the United Nations. This period is also 
intended to facilitate the work of the Greek presidency of the 
European Union [EU], which began 1 January and ends 30 June. 
  Although Foreign Minister Javier Solana has diplomatically 
denied during several of his parliamentary appearances that the 
establishment of relations with Macedonia by six EU countries 
(Germany, France, Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands, and 
Denmark) represents a major failure of the common foreign and 
security policy, it could hardly be interpreted otherwise when 
half the EU countries reject what the other six approve in an 
especially difficult situation such as that prevailing in the 
former Yugoslavia. To this must be added another affront which 
the Spanish Government will hardly forget: Chancellor Kohl 
publicly lied during the Spanish-German summit in Granada when 
-- asked at a news conference whether his country was preparing 
to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Macedonia 
-- he replied that the matter was not on his government's agenda 
for the next few months. Ten days later Bonn announced the 
exchange of ambassadors with Skopje. 
  For Spain and the other EU countries which did not support 
the French, British, and German initiative, the aim now is to 
facilitate the course of the Greek presidency, which looks like 
being difficult. "To send ambassadors to Skopje now will not 
resolve the political and security problem threatening that 
republic and the Kosovo region. The United Nations undertook a 
serious commitment by sending Blue Helmets to Macedonia, and 
Spain supports this decision. We must bide our time and hope 
that the Macedonians and Greeks will reach a compromise 
solution," a Spanish diplomatic source told LA VANGUARDIA. 
  The Spanish Government has been quite sensitive to the 
criticisms condemning it for not joining the group of the 
European "heavyweights" in establishing diplomatic relations 
with Macedonia. However, everything indicates that the exchange 
of ambassadors will not take place until midsummer.

<F P=106> [Josep Gisbert report: "Pujol Seeks Direct Political </F>
Agreement With Gonzalez"] 
  [Excerpt] Barcelona -- [Catalan Prime Minister] Jordi Pujol 
asserted yesterday that the various matters under negotiation 
between the Generalitat [Catalan government] and the [Spanish] 
government, now and in the future, "will not prosper unless 
there is a political agreement at the highest level;" namely, 
between himself and Felipe Gonzalez. The agreement, the terms 
of which he did not specify, would come about, when the time 
comes, within the framework of a conversation between the two 
top leaders, who in fact have an official meeting pending for 
which no date has been set, although it is forecast that it 
could be held from January onward. 
  The case Jordi Pujol cited of a negotiation currently under 
way was the negotiation on the police force model, on the basis 
of the draft bill on the police approved by the [Catalan] 
government, which he discussed this week with government 
representative in Catalonia Miquel Solans and which he plans to 
discuss next week with Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion, who 
will be visiting Barcelona in order to meet with the Generalitat 
premier, "because the agreement reached with Jose Luis Corcuera 
in 1990 is exhausted and must quite naturally, of course, be 
reviewed." Nevertheless, Jordi Pujol stressed that contacts 
with ministers -- "not just in this case, but in all cases" -- 
are not enough to reach agreements. To achieve this, he must 
hold contacts with Felipe Gonzalez. In practical terms, this was 
a reminder that his sole interlocutor is the prime minister and 
that, as he himself has already hinted on previous occasions, 
their mutual relationship does not allow the existence of 
intermediaries. The Generalitat premier would not assess 
relations with the government within this framework, "because 
they are evolving, and static assessments cannot be made," 
although he specified that "the abolition of civil governors is 
badly blocked." [passage omitted]

located. The explosion took place on the eve of the NATO summit 
in Brussels, which U.S. President Bill Clinton is attending. 
The two-kilo explosive device went off shortly after 0100 in 
the Eur district on the outskirts of Rome. No one was hurt, but 
material damage was significant. 
  According to an eyewitness, four people left the scene in an 
Alfa 33 immediately after the blast in Viale Beethoven, near 
Piazza Don Sturzo, where the former headquarters of the 
Christian Democratic Party were located. The explosion caused a 
one-meter-wide crater. Bomb disposal experts immediately went to 
the scene to find out what sort of explosive was used by the 
terrorists. Investigators must also establish whether last 
night's bomb attack against the NATO offices in Rome is 
connected with the start of the summit in Brussels.

  [Text] Rome, 10 Jan (ANSA) -- A two-kilogram bomb exploded 
outside the NATO Command Defense College offices in Rome shortly 
after midnight on Sunday night [9 January], causing some damage 
but no injuries, police reported. 
  No one has yet claimed responsibility for the bomb, which 
was 
placed next to one of the marble columns supporting the 
two-storey building and left a crater about 1.5 meters deep. 
  Security at all NATO offices in Europe was immediately 
tightened in response to the bombing, Italian officials said. A 
NATO summit begins Monday morning in Brussels. 
  The NATO Defense College is in the EUR neighborhood, on the 
southern outskirts of the capital, in the same building as a 
branch of Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura [National 
Agricultural Bank] and some municipal offices. The building has 
a closed-circuit camera security system and 24-hour guard 
service but no one reportedly noticed anything suspicious before 
the explosion. 
  Eyewitnesses reported seeing four men leaving the site of 
the 
attack aboard a gray Alfa Romeo shortly before the bombing.

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Udo van Kampen in Brussels on 7 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Van Kampen] Mr. Woerner, the former Warsaw Pact 
states are impetuously urging to join NATO. What can they 
expect from the forthcoming summit? 
  [Woerner] Two things that lead in this direction: First, a 
declaration of principle that we are willing to accept new 
members in an evolutionary process, without giving a specific 
deadline or criteria for that; second, a very specific offer -- 
Partnership for Peace, which is close political and military 
cooperation agreed on between the respective state and NATO. 
  [Van Kampen] In particular the Poles say: This is not 
enough for us. We want a specific date so as to have our 
security interests safeguarded. 
  [Woerner] I do not think that such a decision will be made 
at the summit. For that we still need some time. However, one 
can see this offer of Partnership for Peace as a first step for 
some of these states on the path toward membership. 
  [Van Kampen] But is there still time for that after the 
election success of right-wing extremist Zhirinovskiy in Russia? 
  [Woerner] I think there is still time. There is no question 
that, of course, Russia's behavior will influence the decisions 
of this alliance in the future and, to a certain extent, also 
the speed with which this process will take place. 
  [Van Kampen] Is there not too much consideration for 
Russia's interests? Does this not practically mean that Russia 
has a veto right? 
  [Woerner] Quite the contrary. We do not give anyone a veto 
right -- not the Russians, either. However, it is clear that we 
do not make this decision in the abstract sense but in a very 
specific security situation and in view of two big historical 
changes -- first, building a new security architecture for all 
of Europe, together with the Russians and not against the 
Russians. This is an important international goal, which is 
also in the interest of the East Europeans. Second, anchoring 
the East Europeans -- at least those that belong to the West -- 
firmly in the structures of the West. 
  [Van Kampen] Are you afraid that a speedy expansion of NATO 
toward the east might weaken the alliance? 
  [Woerner] If this were done precipitately, and if one were 
to take in too many new members all at once, this would indeed 
be a consequence. However, no one wants this. This will be a 
gradual process so that the Alliance's ability to make decisions 
is not endangered. 
  [Van Kampen] Well, there are voices that the enemy image 
from the East has vanished -- let us be honest and, perhaps, 
dissolve NATO entirely. 
  [Woerner] I can only say that NATO is now more popular than 
ever. We have a number of states that want to join NATO, 
because NATO is the one decisive factor of stability that 
currently exists in the world. In a time of increasing 
instability one does not dissolve the only stable element. On 
the contrary, NATO is gaining additional weight. 
  [Van Kampen] What will NATO look like in the year 2000? 
Which role will it play? 
  [Woerner] I think that it will then, hopefully, be the 
anchor of stability of a comprehensive Euro-Atlantic security 
system. I think that it will deal even more intensively than 
hitherto with crisis settlement. Of course, it will continue to 
fulfill one task: ensuring the safety of its member states and 
this means safeguarding peace.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Austria Right at the Top"] </F>
  [Excerpt] As a result of the new asylum law, the there is 
a 19.29 percent recognition rate of asylum requests. This was 
announced by Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak on Wednesday [5 
January]. Thus, Austria is still right at the top of the list 
of European states -- "quite in contrast to the assumptions of 
the Greens and of other groups, which advocate unrestricted 
immigration to Austria," the minister said. 
  A total of 10,879 asylum requests have been made since June 
1992, of which 2,348 have not yet been decided, 528 have been 
retracted, 6,505 have been decided negatively, and 1,497 have 
been decided positively, Loeschnak said. In 1993, 4,743 
applications for asylum were made. The main countries of origin 
of the asylum-seekers were Bosnia-Herzegovina (1,259), Iraq 
(541), the FRY (372), and Turkey (328). In 1993, the majority 
of the still open asylum procedures were dealt with; a total of 
15,885 requests were decided, Loeschnak stressed. Of the asylum 
procedures that were decided positively in 1993, 543 affected 
persons from Bosnia-Herzegovina; thus, the recognition rate is 
42 percent. 
  At the end of 1993, 40,184 persons were included in the 
support campaign for people driven out of Bosnia-Herzegovina by 
the war; 13,527 were housed in large accommodations. The 
average influx into the support campaign was about 1,000 persons 
per month last year. From January to November 1993, 8,290 
persons were deported by the immigration police and 4,956 
persons were sent back after crossing the border illegally, 
Loeschnak said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] It has been discovered that the preparations for a 
wide-scale operation against the Workers Party of Kurdistan 
[PKK] this winter has been intensified, special commando units 
in the garrisons have been transferred to sensitive areas, and 
several special army units have been based in Sirnak. 
  Reports from southeastern Turkey indicate that the operation 
against the PKK in sensitive areas has already begun. The State 
of Emergency Governor's Office has moved to implement the 
security measures planned for Nevruz [spring festival] and the 
local elections in March. Teams have been established to work 
at the Winter Operations Headquarters to maintain effective 
coordination between the military and civilian units around the 
clock. State of Emergency Governor Unal Erkan, Deputy State of 
Emergency Governor Ahmet Erturk, and other high-ranking 
officials closely studied the preparations during the past three 
days. 
<H5>  Special Teams Based in the Region </H5>
  Special security measures are being taken against the PKK's 
urban activities in Diyarbakir, Batman, and Sirnak, which have 
been declared sensitive towns. It has been reported that the 
towns are being patrolled by trained teams of two or four 
security personnel armed with automatic Kalashnikov firearms. 
The patrol units wear civilian clothes and carry field radios. 
Meanwhile, some 500 civilian police have been transferred to 
the region to maintain security at public establishments and 
installations used by the media and the private sector. 
  It has been reported that the first special Army teams in 
the 
region have been based at the installations used by the Turkish 
Coal Mining Works Company, which are 10 km from Sirnak. The 
teams reportedly are prepared to render ineffective the Botan 
branch of the PKK in Sirnak, Idil, and Cizre. It has also been 
reported that they clashed with the PKK militants between 
Ikiztepe and Toptepe Villages the night before last, and that 
special teams will be deployed to predetermined areas in that 
region. 
<H5>  F-16 Aircraft Based in Diyarbakir </H5>
  The preparatory work required to deploy F-16 aircraft at the 
2d Tactical Air Base in Diyarbakir has been completed. Two F-16 
squadrons reportedly will be based in Diyarbakir in the next few 
days. The officials are convinced that the F-16's, which are 
equipped with systems that lock on to enemy targets, will be 
effective against the PKK.

<F P=106> [Report by Claus Gennrich on interview with Federal </F>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on 7 January: "Kohl: NATO Must 
Take the Security Needs of Eastern Neighbors Seriously"] 
  [Text] In one week, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
will formally decide that the president of the Federal 
Constitutional Court, Herzog, will be its candidate for the 
presidential election in May. In an interview with FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE on Friday [7 January], Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
said: "The leading bodies of the CDU -- the party executive 
committee and the presidium -- at their first session after the 
Christmas recess, scheduled for next Friday and Saturday will 
also discuss the issue of the nomination of the candidate for 
the office of federal president and make a decision; in 
addition, we will stick to what I announced before, namely that 
we will also discuss the matter with our coalition partner, the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]." Yet, such talks have 
obviously not yet been scheduled for the next few days. For 
Kohl, the talks of the Western alliance scheduled for Monday and 
Tuesday in Brussels have priority. 
  Kohl said: "When we discuss European security within NATO in 
the next few days, we will try to combine two important 
objectives." Kohl said that as a first objective, the justified 
security needs of Germany's Eastern neighbors have to be "taken 
very seriously." The chancellor stated: "If we, as the NATO 
document says, offer `Partnership for Peace' to our neighbors, 
such as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, then, to me, 
that means that this is not a mere diplomatic formula, but that 
we are providing clear prospects for future NATO entry." In 
connection with security policy, Kohl then switched from NATO to 
the European Union [EU]: "This includes that I am absolutely in 
favor of EU membership for these countries once they fulfill the 
economic conditions." According to Kohl, the second objective, 
which Germany will pursue at the NATO meeting, is: "I am in 
favor of NATO extending and shaping security relations with 
Russia to a close level to dispel from the very beginning fears 
that can be heard in Moscow -- namely that the West was pursuing 
a policy of isolation toward Russia." Without actually 
mentioning the name of the nationalist politician Zhirinovskiy, 
Kohl said: "The shrill extremist noises one can hear in Moscow 
these days must not be ignored; however, they must not dissuade 
us from continuing our course. On the contrary, they are an 
additional reason to maintain the close relations with 
particular care." 
  The dramatic development after the collapse of the Soviet 
Union does not only offer the chance for building a law-governed 
democratic system on the basis of the market economy but also 
dangers. One can now see that nationalism and imperial claims 
may increase. 
  Kohl concluded: "I clearly support President Yeltsin's 
policy of reform and I expect that in the process of 
establishing a democratic system, a relapse into old thinking 
can be warded off." For 1994, it is important for Germany to be 
ready to acknowledge the dramatic changes in the world. Kohl 
said that Bismarck's statement was still valid -- that is, that 
a nation's fate is determined by foreign policy. Kohl 
criticized widespread provincial thinking in Germany when the 
situation in Germany requires "us to recognize again the 
outstanding importance of foreign policy." 
  Kohl said that he saw it as one of his greatest achievements 
that it was possible to reduce, at least in part, distrust, 
which was noticeable in connection with German unification in 
1989 and 1990 in the East and the West. "I am proud that 
relations with the United States, France, and Russia are very 
good." At the moment, political unification of Europe is more 
important than ever. Too many people are looking at Europe only 
under economic aspects. It is true that Germany's economic 
development depended on its integration in economic and monetary 
union, but "even more important for us is to understand that 48 
years of peace for Germany are not a matter of course; the 
question of European unification is ultimately the question of 
war and peace in the 21st century." The experience in the 
former Yugoslavia shows that the evil spirits of chauvinism, 
religious hatred, and nationalism are "not dead": "No one 
should think that they could not be resurrected in other parts 
of Europe." European unification, however, offers the strongest 
bulwark. The Germans and the Europeans must not indulge in 
self-contemplation. The development of North-South relations are 
dramatic. Kohl said: "For me, it is of particular importance to 
look at the economic and political development in Asia with more 
attention than in the past." He said that he was trying to 
intensify relations with China, Japan, India, and Indonesia. 
  Economically, 1993 was a particularly difficult year for 
Germany. "Recession has mercilessly laid bare our structural 
weaknesses." Deficiencies of the past decades have been clearly 
exposed. Securing Germany's future requires a process of 
rethinking in all areas: "As an export nation, we have become 
too expensive due to our high wage level." Yet, the 
difficulties cannot only be blamed on the high wage level. 
Germany has lost ground as far as translating research results 
into new products and tapping new export markets are concerned. 
<H5>  Prospects for 1994 </H5>
  The parties, the business community, and the trade unions 
are 
all to blame for the deficiencies. However, there are now "many 
favorable prospects" indicating that in 1994, "we will be able 
to stop the negative trend." In his assessment of the 
situation, Kohl referred to the recovery of the economy in the 
United States and other countries. The stock exchange was also 
optimistic. "We have good chances of clearly forcing the 
inflation rate under 4 percent again." Yet, despite the fact 
that there was more light at the end of the tunnel, the 
necessary development at the labor market will follow only with 
much delay. Therefore, the struggle against unemployment and 
the creation of new jobs are the most important objective. Kohl 
said: "Unemployment is not a matter of statistical figures for 
me. First of all, I see the fate of the affected people and 
families." He was hoping that in the upcoming wage talks, both 
sides of industry were taking the stabilization of the labor 
market into consideration: "Safe jobs must have priority over 
wage increases." 
  Kohl added: "The state must set reasonable signals in the 
public service sphere as well." He considers it important for 
all parties involved to respond to the challenges of the labor 
market with the necessary sincerity and with new ideas. As one 
example, Kohl endorsed part-time jobs. By European standards, 
Germany was offering the lowest number of part-time jobs, only 
15 percent. If it were possible to raise the number of 
part-time jobs to the level of the Netherlands (34 percent), as 
many as 2 million people could find employment in Germany. 
Surveys in the old laender have shown that some 2 million fully 
employed people would be willing to work fewer hours. 
<H5>  Head Wind and Fear </H5>
  Kohl claimed that last year, the Federal Government made 
considerable achievements for securing the future with its 
contribution to the conclusion of the GATT talks: "As a result 
of the GATT agreement, Germany will make up to 50 billion German 
marks [DM] in prosperity profits." Considerable improvement in 
the sphere of housing construction has been achieved: "In 
western Germany, 400,000 new apartments were built in 1993, more 
than the record number of 1977; in eastern Germany, the number 
of construction licenses doubled over 1992." Despite such 
success, the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the coalition 
have to struggle with a head wind. Nevertheless, what the 
people really think is more favorable than the picture that is 
generally presented. In all Western countries and Germany, one 
can see that many people are unable to cope with the dramatic 
changes. The rapid succession of images and events has 
contributed to a feeling of insecurity: "Existential fears have 
increased." 
  In the election year, people might be "greatly enticed to 
use 
this fear for political profits." The loss of faith as a result 
of the major secularization step has created fear. The request 
to the moral force of the churches for a consensus of values has 
become more important. "Qualities that were ridiculed during 
many years by left-wing forces as secondary virtues are now more 
important than ever: compassion, solidarity, a sense of reality, 
courage, hard work, and loyalty." One will be unable to 
overcome economic difficulties without reflecting on these 
values and foundations. We must stop thinking only about our 
well-acquired rights: "Insisting on the status quo will not 
take us any further." 
  The question is not to reduce but to rebuild our social 
system. Hard work must be worth the effort again. The stability 
of the currency must have priority. That means: "We must 
maintain a very tight public budget." Responsibility lies first 
of all with the politicians: "I personally acknowledge that." 
However, the politicians cannot achieve everything by 
themselves: "In no way can I accept a trend where people retire 
into their privileged positions in society and shirk their 
responsibilities." Cooperation between all members of society 
is necessary and the sense for the commonwealth must be 
developed. Despite all the problems, there is no reason to be 
pessimistic. Compared to the difficulties of other countries, I 
cannot understand the lamentation and obsession with complaining 
in this country: "I also want to make this issue a topic in my 
election campaign." 
  The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] was avoiding a 
discussion on facts and indulges in populism. In decisive 
questions of German unity, the SPD used to bank on the principle 
of opportunism. Kohl said: Of course, we have not only made 
many important decisions but also mistakes; still, considering 
the criticism voiced by the SPD, I am astonished over the 
impertinence of those who had long since given up and betrayed 
the idea of German unity, and who even wanted, for example, to 
accept Honecker's demand for recognizing a separate GDR 
citizenship, and who wanted to dissolve the central office at 
Salzgitter that registered law infringements by the GDR judicial 
authorities." 
  With a view to the challenges of the 1994 election year for 
the CDU/CSU and himself, Chancellor Kohl said: "I want the 
coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP to continue." Kohl 
was determined: "We must fight for every single vote and 
approach the voters. We must mobilize our voters and offer a 
clear alternative to the SPD, which means that to secure the 
future of our country, we must change our way of thinking and 
support the necessary, albeit at times unpopular, measures with 
great resolve and represent our better arguments." Then, I 
think we will stand "a good chance" in the election.

does not intend to take part in any grand coalition in Bonn in 
which the CDU is the junior partner. According to the news 
magazine FOCUS this was made clear by party leader [Finance 
Minister] Theo Waigel at the closed CSU meeting in Wildbad 
Kreuth. "There will be no grand coalition in which the CDU is 
junior partner with the CSU [Christian Social Union]. In that 
event, they [the CSU] will go over to the opposition," the 
Munich-based magazine quoted the party chairman as saying.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 9 (AFP) -- NATO's main priority should be 
to develop a common West European defense strategy, French 
President Francois Mitterrand said Sunday [9 January], adding 
that it was too soon to consider giving East European countries 
full NATO membership. 
  Mitterrand, in an exclusive interview with AFP on the eve of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit in Brussels, also 
reiterated his opposition to a resumption of nuclear testing by 
France and dismissed any possibility of his country rejoining 
the alliance's integrated military command. 
  President Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of NATO's 
integrated military command in 1966. 
  NATO's "first priority is to take into account Europe's 
identity" in terms of defense, Mitterrand said. 
  "In the United States, the Clinton administration seems 
willing to take into account this progressive ability by the 
European Union."

  [Text] Tomorrow a crucial week will begin for the 
government and for the current legislature. On Wednesday [12 
January], there will be the no-confidence debate and vote, then 
President Scalfaro will decide when to dissolve the chambers. 
Giovanni Masotti reports: 
  [Masotti] This could be the final week for this brief and 
troubled Eleventh legislature -- the last one of the First 
Republic. The elections of 5 April 1992 seem like a very long 
time ago. These elections brought about the formation of this 
parliament, which has been rocked by the Clean Hands enquiry. 
  In the last few hours, further poisonous speculation has 
been 
aimed at the president and at the institutions. On Tuesday, an 
event will be held that seems to symbolize the end of an era -- 
on the eve of Wednesday's no-confidence debate, the 
parliamentary Immunity Committee will question [Maurizio] 
Broccoletti, the former Intelligence and Democratic Security 
Service [Sisde] treasurer, and it will examine the position of 
the former interior ministers, [Antonio] Gava and [Vicenzo] 
Scotti. The day after the no-confidence debate, Prime Minister 
Ciampi could go to the Quirinale Palace [president's office] and 
hand in his resignation to President Scalfaro without waiting 
for the outcome of the no-confidence vote which has been 
presented by Pannella. On Friday, the head of state could then 
decide to dissolve the chambers. 
  In the meantime, all eyes are turned to the possible voting 
alliances. There has been hectic activity on the moderate 
front, which is trying to gather in its sparse membership. Bossi 
has done a U-turn by announcing that federalism can wait, that 
the Northern League is happy with regionalism so as not to 
divide the Liberal Democrats and to beat Occhetto. Bossi's 
declarations have been welcomed by both the Christian Democrat 
neo-Centrists who are ready to ditch Martinazzoli and by 
Berlusconi, who has been discussing the possibility of an 
alliance with the League for a long time.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Andreas Unterberger: "NATO, or -- the </F>
Winners' Efforts"] 
  [Text] There is nothing more burdensome than success. 
This is something that the Western defense alliance, NATO, will 
be feeling very painfully during its summit starting today. 
NATO is the most successful military alliance in history. It 
has guaranteed its members -- and some others, like Austria, in 
their vicinity -- freedom, peace, democracy, and wealth for a 
sensationally long period of time. It brought down its opponent 
-- in defense against whom it had originally been established -- 
without firing a single shot. And, it seems to be the promised 
land in the future as well -- at least judging by the membership 
candidates queuing up at its doors. 
  This makes all those who regarded NATO as the kingdom of 
evil 
over the past decades, ranging from the Social Democrats to the 
Greens, look like foreign policy idiots. This includes all 
those who, like Austrian diplomats, did not even want to shake 
NATO hands for a long time. 
  So much for NATO's successes in the past. As for the future, 
it may well be that the hope placed on NATO all over Europe 
could turn out to be just as stupid, or at least naive. For, 
first of all, NATO's coherence in the past was mainly a result 
of the apocalyptic threat posed by the gigantic armament and 
aggressive policy of the East. The end of this threat makes one 
fear a reduction of mutual solidarity within the old NATO. 
  Second, it is doubtful whether the alliance will ever be 
prepared to accept new members from the former Warsaw Pact. 
Unlike the Germans, the Americans and the British reject this 
option altogether. They would only make an exception for the 
neutral countries -- in case there will ever be official 
interest in NATO membership in those states. For the rest of 
Europe, Russia's veto is respected. Due to a very false 
estimation resulting from Russia's size and nuclear armament, 
Washington and London still consider Moscow the only relevant 
partner in the East. The cynical statement by East European 
leaders, asking whether they require Boris Yeltsin's approval 
before joining NATO, hits the nail on the head. 
  Of course, there is a third question mark over the future of 
the alliance, which would make an expansion toward the East 
doubtful, even without Moscow's veto. For, to the same extent 
that candidates for membership want to enjoy NATO's security, 
they would bring insecurity into the alliance. Let me just 
mention the conflict over minorities between Hungary and 
Slovakia. Unrest within its own ranks is the last thing that 
NATO, which has enough problems with its old members Turkey and 
Greece, wants. 
  The only republic in the former East Bloc where these fears 
are unfounded is the Czech one. Prague is very well aware of 
the value its democratic, ethnic, and economic stability has. 
This is why the Czechs have been wise enough not to bind 
themselves in oaths of solidarity with the other East European 
states, who (only) want to join NATO. Although Prague's 
neighbors to the north and east are somewhat offended, the 
clever Czechs have clearly signalled to NATO: Take us, we are 
easy, we do not have a common border with the former Soviet 
Union. 
  This requires difficult decisions on the part of the Western 
alliance, not only in today's summit but over the next few 
years. The winner takes it all -- including the worries about 
the losers.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] We return to the center of attention 
in the world today: the NATO summit. [passage omitted] 
  The Atlantic alliance's summit has already accepted the 
Partnership for Peace proposed by the U.S. -- a half-way formula 
to satisfy desires for security, although the East European 
countries consider it still not enough. The Balkans war is the 
other pressing question at this NATO summit and, in this regard, 
a toughening of the sanctions against the Serbs has already been 
agreed on, with the repeated threat of air strikes if the 
attacks do not cease. Meanwhile, Spain has succeeded in getting 
security in the Mediterranean on the agenda of the summit. 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is in Brussels. Our 
correspondent Nacho Hernandez also reports from there. Good 
afternoon. 
  [Hernandez] Good afternoon. In his speech Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez emphasized the points contained in this 
declaration: The importance of strengthening the transatlantic 
link and support for the initiative on Partnership for Peace. 
Spain thinks that this formula for the former members of the 
Warsaw Pact does not mean automatic application of Article V of 
NATO, which establishes immediate response by the Allies in the 
case of an attack. Foreign Minister Javier Solana: 
  [Begin Solana recording] We are all fighting for greater 
stability in Europe and logically in face of potential focuses 
of instability we must act. [end recording] 
  [Hernandez] In the [draft] final communique of this summit 
there is a reaffirmation of the decision adopted by NATO in 
August according to which allied aircraft would bomb military 
positions to end the siege of Sarajevo under the command of the 
UN Security Council. The sanctions will also be strengthened 
and there is talk of determination to put an end to the 
obstacles facing the UN Forces in Bosnia. It is not acceptable, 
the foreign minister said, for the blue helmets to have 
difficulties in carrying out their humanitarian aid missions. 
  Of great interest to Spain is the declaration included on 
stability in the Mediterranean. We reiterate, it says, that 
security in Europe is affected by security in the Mediterranean. 
Dialogue with the countries of the region will be promoted. 
Efforts directed to strengthening security in this region must 
be increased, the final declaration adds.

<F P=106> [Video report by Zafer Kiraz from Brussels] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In a speech at the NATO 
summit, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller discussed Turkey's 
assessment of the recent developments and of the roles NATO must 
play within that framework. The meeting was held in camera. 
  In a statement on her speech Ciller listed the main points 
of 
this assessment as follows: Turkey is pleased with the 
establishment of the European Union and of a European security 
and defense identity. However, this identity must include all 
the European NATO members; in other words, Turkey must be a full 
member of the European Union. 
  The alliance remains inadequate before the clashes and human 
tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Whatever is necessary must be 
done to prevent new tragedies elsewhere. NATO must continue to 
be an intervening power in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and when an 
agreement is reached, it must make contributions, not only 
donations. We must either protect the innocent, or we must lift 
the arms embargo. The people of another country are not the 
children of another God. 
  The attack on Azerbaijan must stop. 
  We support the process of democracy and reform in Russia. 
  Everyone must support the independence of the new republics 
established in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse. 
  Turkey views positively the project of a united and common 
duty force that can be established to protect peace. 
  The proliferation of mass destruction weapons constitutes an 
important threat, and is therefore an important source of danger 
in Turkey's region. This threat can be eliminated only through 
joint effort. 
  Terrorism is a kind of war aimed against democracy and human 
rights, and no pretext can conceal this fact. Those who support 
terrorism end up being its victims. As in other fields, we must 
be in solidarity and cooperation regarding this issue as well. 
  For Turkey, the territorial integrity and independence of 
every ally is sacred. We expect the same approach from our 
allies. 
  We live in an uncertain world. Even though unity is more 
difficult in such situations, it is important. Those who want 
to foresee the future must be strong enough to form the future.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- The leaders of the 16 NATO 
countries on Monday [10 January] signed a document inviting 
former communist states to join the so-called Partnership for 
Peace as a possible precursor to full NATO membership. 
  The invitation and framework agreement is to serve as the 
basis for bilateral accords to be offered to Russia and its 
ex-satellites allowing cooperation in military planning, 
training and other activities. 
  It also provides for consultations in a crisis, but stops 
short of giving security guarantees or promising full membership 
eagerly sought by countries such as Poland, Hungary and the 
Czech Republic. 
  "We reaffirm that the alliance...remains open to the 
membership of other European states in a position to further the 
principles of the treaty and to contribute to the security of 
the North Atlantic area," the document said. 
  "We expect and would welcome NATO expansion that would reach 
to democratic states to our east, as part of an evolutionary 
process, taking into account political and security developments 
in the whole of Europe. 
  "We therefore invite the other states participating in the 
NACC and other CSCE countries able and willing to contribute to 
this programme, to join with us in this partnership," it said, 
referring to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. 
  The document sets out broad principles with which all 
members 
must comply -- including respect for democracy, and transparency 
in budget and defence policymaking. 
  Individual countries can then negotiate bilateral accords 
with NATO on how and to what extent they will participate in the 
Partnership's activities. 
  Participation can include joint military operations from 
next 
year, and sending permanent representatives to NATO headquarters 
here to take part in military planning. 
  The document added: "Active participation in the Partnership 
for Peace will play an important role in the evolutionary 
process of the expansion of NATO."

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Alexander Szandar and Rainer Poertner in Brussels; date not 
given: "A Unique Opportunity"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Secretary General, the 
nationalists and the fascists are gaining followers in Moscow 
and old enemy images of the evil East are reemerging in the 
West. Is a new Cold War emerging? 
  [Woerner] I hope that we can prevent this by means of a 
policy that makes the available alternatives clear to Russia: 
Either it continues the reforms and follows the path of 
cooperation with us or it risks that the world becomes dark 
again. NATO wants the first alternative and, together with 
Russia, it wants to establish a new European security system. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] It seems likely that the frontlines will 
become more rigid again. Fascist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is 
threatening the Germans and others with complete destruction. 
  [Woerner] Even though Mr. Zhirinovskiy achieved a 
considerable number of votes at the elections, he does not 
determine the guidelines of Russian policy. These are still 
determined by President Yeltsin, and he is not interested in 
confrontation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] He is also becoming increasingly aggressive 
and nationalist in his statements. 
  [Woerner] We see that, too. However, one does not know to 
what extent he is serious about that or just triying to 
safeguard himself against the right. It is clear that close 
cooperation, for which we are striving, is incompatible with the 
revival of an expansionist Russian foreign policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But it would probably help NATO to get out of 
the identity crisis in which it has been mired since the 
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. 
  [Woerner] The NATO summit will prove that such a crisis does 
not exist. The alliance has never been as popular as it is now. 
There are many countries that want to get in, but no countries 
that want to get out. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There is a lot of quarreling about where NATO 
is supposed to be heading. The British and the Americans want 
to return to the origins as a purely military alliance. The 
Germans see the alliance primarily as a political instrument to 
stabilize Eastern Europe. 
  [Woerner] There will always be differences of opinion about 
the course because we are a democratic alliance. I am sure that 
the summit will confirm the classical role of the alliance and, 
in addition, define two new ones. First, we need crisis 
management and the safeguarding of peace beyond the NATO borders 
and, second, the projection of stability toward the East. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] At the moment, the alliance offers a rather 
miserable picture in this respect. 
  [Woerner] I strongly object! It is not a miserable picture 
if one switches from confrontation to cooperation with all 
former opponents within the period of just two years. This is a 
virtually revolutionary change. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why did the alliance not seize the opportunity 
when Yeltsin said in Warsaw in August that he is not against 
NATO membership by the Poles, Hungarians, or Czechs? 
  [Woerner] We are acting in line with our own standards and 
not on order. Furthermore, Yeltsin talks differently today than 
in Warsaw. He has changed his course. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And NATO promptly refuses to take in new 
members. 
  [Woerner] Our course is determined by ourselves and not by 
Mr. Yeltsin. I am energetically in favor of taking in some of 
the states in Central and East Europe. They are so clearly part 
of the West in cultural and historical terms that one must 
anchor them there. This is our historic mission. I hope that 
the alliance will resolve at the summit that it is basically 
ready for expansion. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There will neither be a schedule nor criteria 
for new members. In reality, no one in the West is willing to 
give security guarantees to Warsaw or Budapest at the moment -- 
especially not the nuclear power United States. 
  [Woerner] You are right: At the moment, we are not willing 
to give a schedule or criteria for membership. There will be no 
security guarantee at the summit. But, I think some countries 
will get it over the course of time. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There is only the question of when? 
  [Woerner] This remains open at the moment. The Americans -- 
whom you just mentioned -- are very serious about a security 
guarantee, because if they give one, they fulfill it. However, 
they are also certainly willing to expand the alliance -- but in 
a way that does not offend the Russians. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, Moscow does have a veto right? 
  [Woerner] We do not give a veto right to anyone. However, 
it is certainly understandable that we do not want to do 
anything now that would promote a radicalization in Russia or 
pushes the country out of a gradually growing Euro-Atlantic 
community during a very sensitive period of history. History 
and future generations would not forgive us for that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Therefore, NATO offers everyone who wants to 
get into the alliance a lot of topical ointment, called 
Partnership for Peace? 
  [Woerner] Why topical ointment? We offer a substantive 
package of specific cooperation, with which some states can 
prepare for membership without offending others. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your package is a fraud. It just contains 
plans that the North Atlantic Cooperation Council had already 
announced in December. 
  [Woerner] That is not true; we go far beyond that. First of 
all, Partnership for Peace means making the doctrines and 
defense structures and the budgets and operational concepts of 
the partner states compatible with ours in such a way that this 
will result in better cooperation or, under certain 
circumstances, even membership. 
  This includes joint exercises and, selectively, joint 
training. In my view, later on there will be technological 
cooperation concerning equipment. I see a very broad range here 
-- over a long period, of course. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Central and East Europeans think this is 
too little; they feel left in the lurch by NATO. 
  [Woerner] It makes me angry that not only here but also in 
East Europe people constantly talk in extremes. The issue is 
not the wrong alternatives: security guarantee or security 
vacuum. The security situation of these states has already 
improved as a result of the current cooperation with the 
Atlantic alliance. We have stated again and again that their 
security is a matter close to our hearts. Anyone who thought of 
touching them would have to think very thoroughly about what 
reaction he would have to expect from the alliance. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you have understanding for Czech President 
Vaclav Havel? He says: Nonexpansion by NATO at the moment 
would be a fatal mistake, a giving in to chauvinist forces in 
Russia and encouragement of imperial ambitions. 
  [Woerner] I understand Vaclav Havel's line of arguments. It 
differs from mine only in some aspects. However, he exaggerates 
the conclusions. On the contrary, we do not reject these 
states. They can embark on the path that will one day lead to 
membership. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this offer apply to all states to the 
east of the old NATO, including the still-nuclear power Ukraine 
and the Baltic states? Lithuania has just formally requested 
acceptance into the alliance. 
  [Woerner] Partnership for Peace is aimed at everyone who is 
interested. There will come a time when we will differentiate. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] After all, the fear is that the European 
continent will be divided into spheres of influence as in the 
past: here NATO, there the former Soviet Union, and the rest 
remains an unstable Europe in between? 
  [Woerner] NATO does not establish spheres of influence, nor 
will it promote the establishment of such a sphere by others. 
Our concept is cooperative security for all of Europe. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] A relapse into a policy of power and alliance 
as in the last century is feared. 
  [Woerner] In contrast to the period at the beginning of this 
century, now we have two international instigations that can 
prevent the threatening relapse -- the European Union and the 
Atlantic alliance. They are facing two historic tasks: first, 
establishing the new overall Europe by including the largest 
European power of today and tomorrow -- that is, a strategic 
partnership with Russia; second anchoring the new democracies in 
Central and East Europe in the structures of the West. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are these not very contradictory goals? 
  [Woerner] Why should this be mutually exclusive? Of course, 
it is always the task of the statesman's skill to make sure that 
both processes take place harmonically and are coordinated. For 
this we need diplomatic skill, cautiousness, flexibility, but 
also leadership. After all, the alternative is that this Europe 
will fall apart and old categories of power policy will become 
dominant again. We have a unique historical opportunity, which 
one can also ruin or fail to seize. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do we absolutely need NATO and the Americans 
for that? 
  [Woerner] Yes, they provide the geopolitical balance -- even 
in a cooperative relationship with the Russians. On the other 
hand, the alliance is necessary also for the current balance in 
West Europe, because otherwise the old question: "Who controls 
whom?" in Europe might occupy first place again. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you seriously believe that NATO and the 
European Union will be able to master these tasks? 
  [Woerner] Who else? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Despite the fact that even there the forces of 
disintegration are growing? 
  [Woerner] I do not dream of denying that. In view of the 
current historical transition periods and the disappearance of 
the great enemy, the centrifugal trends are increasing. So far, 
we have managed to come to grips with that, and I think that we 
will be able to do that in the future as well. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What is the strategic partnership between the 
West and Moscow supposed to look like? 
  [Woerner] The alliance does not yet have a complete concept 
for that. However, I can give you my personal opinion and cite 
some elements of cooperation, which should be a part of it: 
first, worldwide safeguarding of peace; second, the attempt to 
prevent or master nuclear disasters; and third, preventing the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This will be an 
enormously important field. For this purpose, one day we could 
establish joint crisis control centers to counter future 
threats, such as terrorism with nuclear or chemical weapons. 
  In addition, there should be more intensive strategic tasks 
and the respective national security interests should be 
respected, which should not be confused with the establishment 
of spheres of influence. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you not follow the proposal by 
Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev that the NATO Cooperation 
Council should be given far more authority, from consultations 
in crises to the duty of assistance? 
  [Woerner] Even though the NATO Cooperation Council is being 
developed further, the focus must not shift to it to such an 
extent that the actual NATO would be just an appendage. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Would this be so bad? 
  [Woerner] It would deprive the Cooperation Council of its 
actual support. Many of our partners would oppose that. One 
can ruin the alliance in two ways. Either one prevents it from 
taking over new tasks in addition to its important task of 
defending its own alliance area by military means or one turns 
it into a collective security system just like the CSCE. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Therefore, you are praising NATO as an 
international peacemaker? 
  [Woerner] We have been that and we will remain that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How does that fit in with your constant 
complaints that the alliance failed in its first operation 
outside the alliance area, in the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Woerner] I have said that the international community has 
failed. The alliance has only a modest share in that, because 
then the Europeans were not able to come to grips with the 
Balkan crisis; they did not turn to NATO but to the United 
Nations. The United Nations still holds the responsibility. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In the UN Security Council, it is precisely 
the same states that have a say as in NATO. 
  [Woerner] You forget that there are still other influential 
members. I only cite Russia and China. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But they are not the ones that made a solution 
to the conflict fail, but it was the different interests within 
West Europe and the United States. 
  [Woerner] I would have to say a lot about that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Please do. 
  [Woerner] No, no. I do not want to pin the blame on one 
single state. To my deepest regret, their international 
community did not act in time and not energetically enough. We 
could have prevented a lot of misery. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that after the disaster in 
Yugoslavia and the experiences of the UN mission in Somalia, the 
NATO states will once again manage to rustle up the political 
will for major blue helmet operations? 
  [Woerner] I very much hope that they will learn the 
appropriate lessons. There is no lack of that. I also hope 
that the allies will not lose courage now to participate in well 
thought-out, well-planned operations for safeguarding peace 
under a unified command. Giving up would mean throwing out the 
baby with the bath water. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Balkan war and Somalia have shown that 
nothing goes when the Americans do not want it. Does NATO 
dwindle to being the deputy sheriff of the United States? 
  [Woerner] If that, then the sheriff. But joking apart: The 
United States is still playing -- thank God -- an important 
role. Without American leadership very little is happening in 
Europe -- at least up to now. On the other hand, in particular, 
our summit will give the Europeans the opportunity to strengthen 
their influence within the Atlantic alliance and, possibly, also 
outside. There is only the question whether they will find the 
strength and cohesiveness to seize this opportunity. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For a long time, the Americans did not want 
that. 
  [Woerner] Correct, but today they are interested in having 
the burden eased by a Europe that is capable of action not only 
politically but also militarily. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Europe is still very far away from that. 
  [Woerner] As a European I say: unfortunately. But things 
can get better. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Americans want to foist another task on 
the alliance, namely stopping the proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction, if necessary by force. 
  [Woerner] Why do you say "foist"? Is it not in everyone's 
interest to counter these dangers in time? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] We think that this is a problem that can be 
better solved by politicians and diplomats than by the military. 
  [Woerner] Political and diplomatic efforts are certainly 
most important. However, you cannot ignore the fact that 
nuclear weapons and other mass destruction means continue to 
proliferate in this world -- despite all the political and 
diplomatic efforts. You cannot simply say that this is not also 
a military problem. This would mean closing one's eyes to 
reality. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Should NATO send troops when the Libyans or 
the Iranians develop nuclear weapons? 
  [Woerner] Just think of what would have happened if one had 
not put a stop to Saddam Husayn. NATO must be permitted to 
think about what is going to happen if such weapons were to be 
used against its members and whether there is a financially 
feasible protection, for instance, against individual missile 
attacks. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Who, specifically, is threatening NATO at the 
moment? 
  [Woerner] There are a number of states that are acquiring 
missiles and nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, or at 
least intend to do so. I do not want to list them individually 
here. Why not? Of course, I could name them, but I have no 
intention of doing so. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Woerner, at a dinner in October, you told 
the NATO defense ministers that you had to live solely on rice 
and carrot juice. Are you now permitted to eat something more 
substantial again? 
  [Woerner] May one not make a joke anymore? But if it 
reassures you: yes. However, I will still have to remain on a 
diet for some time. I feel okay with it and I think it helps. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There were efforts to replace you earlier 
because of your failing health. 
  [Woerner] The opposite is true. There were fears that I 
would resign after the summit. However, I have been elected 
until 1996, and I intend to work my full term of office -- 
provided God preserves my health. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Woerner, thank you for this interview.

<F P=106> [Report by Stefan Kornelius: "Draft for Final Communique of </F>
Summit Meeting: NATO Offers East Europe Cautious Rapprochement, 
While at the Same Time Strengthening the Alliance in West 
Europe"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 9 January -- The NATO heads of government and 
the foreign ministers will take cautious steps to establish 
closer relations with the East European states. At the same 
time, they want to strengthen the West European pillar of the 
alliance. In a final communique of the conference, the draft of 
which is available to SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the delegations will 
agree on the following formula: "We expect and would welcome an 
expansion of NATO toward the democratic states east of us in an 
evolutionary process that would take into consideration the 
security-political development in Europe." In a first step, the 
alliance will offer the East European states political and 
military cooperation under the formula Partnership for Peace. 
  The heads of state and government and the foreign ministers 
of the 16 NATO states will meet in Brussels for a two-day 
meeting today. According to the agenda, the declaration 
Partnership for Peace is to be adopted on the first day, and a 
final communique on the second. Both documents have largely 
been completed after weeks of negotiations. Some particularly 
controversial issues -- the financing of Partnership for Peace, 
for example -- are still unsettled. 
  The Partnership for Peace declaration states that NATO will 
remain open for other states "that are in a position to promote 
the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to 
the security of the North Atlantic territory." First of all, 
however, the Partnership program will be adopted to allow the 
development of a new "security relationship." "Active 
participation in the Partnership for Peace program will play a 
significant role in the evolutionary process of NATO expansion," 
the declaration reads. 
  The states of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and 
other CSCE countries have been invited to participate. NATO 
bodies will decide on the election of the partners. NATO 
promises that consultation will be held with every participant 
in the program if its "territorial integrity, political 
independence, or security are in peril." It is still unclear 
whether the individual partners in the program can ask NATO for 
consultations or whether the alliance has to take the first 
step. The communique stipulates that the East European partners 
themselves will decide to what extent they want to reveal their 
defense budgets, to what extent they subject their defense 
ministries to democratic control, and whether they want to 
participate in joint exercises and plannings. NATO wants to 
carry out joint exercises for peacekeeping missions with all 
partners in the program as early as this year. 
  Under the headline "European Security and Defense Identity," 
the final declaration stresses the need for a close link between 
NATO and the Western European Union [WEU], the defense 
organization of the European Union. The individual NATO bodies 
are requested to draft new political and military structures 
with which NATO can react in a more flexible manner to crises. 
NATO wants to strengthen the WEU as its European pillar. The 
military command and task forces of the WEU should be organized 
in a module system. They should be "separable" but not develop 
separate structures. 
  The name of the task force is the Combined Joint Task Force. 
It will consist of army, air force, and naval units of several 
member states of the WEU and other nations. It is conceivable 
to also integrate troops from East European states -- for 
peacekeeping measures of the CSCE, for example. 
  Concerning the chapter "Proliferation of Weapons of Mass 
Destruction," the negotiators failed to adopt the far-reaching 
demands of the United States. A working group is to be 
established that will draft a consistent NATO policy and improve 
the existing measures against the proliferation of the weapons. 
It is not clear yet, for example, in what way NATO should 
become active in preventing proliferation and whether -- this 
would be the most far-reaching scenario -- it may carry out 
punitive expeditions to destroy these weapons. 
  When preparing for the meeting, a dispute apparently erupted 
as to whether the alliance will comment on the renewal of the 
Nonproliferation Treaty on nuclear weapons. The treaty will 
expire in 1995. The draft of the final communique contains the 
following sentence: "We are determined to achieve the unlimited 
and unconditional extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty at the 1995 conference." According to reports, some 
delegations successfully insisted on eliminating the sentence 
from the communique.

  [Text] There was a surprise at the NATO summit in Brussels: 
Bosnia, which was supposed to be on the agenda this evening over 
coffee, over dinner, as they say, was the main subject of Bill 
Clinton's speech this afternoon before the 15 heads of state and 
government of NATO member countries. Bill Clinton was very 
firm: The United States is ready to support NATO air strikes in 
Bosnia if the situation in Sarajevo among Muslim enclaves 
besieged by the Serbs does not improve. However, the United 
Nations must give the go-ahead. The issue will probably be 
discussed in detail this evening. 
  The famous Partnership for Peace initiative was the main 
topic of talks this afternoon. It was signed by 22 countries, 
including Russia and the former East Bloc countries. Willy van 
der Vort has just spoken to Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who 
talked about the two pillars of this Partnership for Peace, 
security and economy: 
  [Begin recording] [Dehaene] I believe that the future of the 
East European countries as democracies will depend much more on 
economic evolution than on military alliances. Indeed, I 
believe that if the new democratic structures cannot bring about 
economic welfare, which means a step backwards economically, 
these democracies will never make it. It is clear that 
partnership with the European Union, which is first and foremost 
an economic partnership, is as important as partnership with 
NATO. 
  [Van der Vort] Are you saying that it is as important, or 
rather, do you have the feeling that you have added an extra 
card to your game, but that what is important will be done by 
the European Union? 
  [Dehaene] I think that the answer is both: Partnership with 
the European Union, with the prospect of the countries of East 
Europe participating in the European Union, also carries 
consequences concerning defense solidarity. 
  [Van der Vort] But the Partnership includes some conditions 
which may slow down the process enabling these Central European 
countries to join the Atlantic alliance. Are you not under the 
impression that this will displease Central European countries? 
  [Dehaene] I do not believe that the Partnership contains 
conditions which may slow down the process. On the contrary, I 
think that the Partnership for Peace contains conditions and an 
organization which should facilitate evolution toward the 
participation of these countries in NATO. Collaboration on the 
military and strategic levels, which is included in this 
Partnership for Peace, goes further than some may think, and I 
believe that it will be very important, during the meeting in 
Prague between President Clinton and [words indistinct] with the 
countries of the [word indistinct], that he should clearly 
explain the contents of the concrete proposal. [end recording]

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Herewith the main points 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's draft declaration 
concerning the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina: 

  -  We deplore 
the continuing conflict in the former Yugoslavia. We continue 
to believe that the conflict in Bosnia must be settled at the 
negotiating table and not on the battlefield. Only the parties 
can bring peace to the former Yugoslavia. Only they can agree 
to lay down their arms and end the violence which for these many 
months has only served to demonstrate that no side can prevail 
in its pursuit of military victory. 
  -  ...We reaffirm our 
determination to contribute to the implementation of a viable 
settlement reached in good faith. 
  -  We denounce the violations by 
the parties of the agreements they have already signed to 
implement a cease-fire and to permit the unimpeded delivery of 
humanitarian assistance to the victims of this terrible 
conflict. This situation cannot be tolerated. We urge all the 
parties to respect their agreements. We are determined to 
eliminate obstacles to the accomplishment of the UNPROFOR (UN 
Protection Force in former Yugoslavia) mandate. We will 
continue operations to enforce the No-Fly Zone over Bosnia. We 
call for the full implementation of the UN Security Council 
resolutions regarding the reinforcement of UNPROFOR. We 
reaffirm our readiness, under the authority of the UN Security 
Council and in accordance with the alliance decisions of 2 and 9 
August 1993, to carry out air strikes in order to prevent the 
strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened 
areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Editorial Report] Paris France-Inter Radio Network in 
French at 0720 GMT on 10 January, in its "Questions by A Plus B" 
program, broadcasts a nine-minute interview with Alain 
Lamassoure, minister of European affairs, by correspondent 
Annette Ardisson. The interview begins with a discussion of 
calls made yesterday for air strikes in Bosnia. Lamassoure 
recalls that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and his German 
counterpart Klaus Kinkel put forward the EU [European Union] 
peace plan in November, and that it is France which is imposing 
the subject of Yugoslavia on the NATO summit. 
  Lamassoure says: "The time has come to make everyone face up 
to their responsibilities -- the three Bosnian sides -- it is 
all too clear today that none of them really want peace -- and 
also all the important Western countries who belong to the 
international community, in such a way that each one should say 
whether they are ready to do something for peace, and what they 
are ready to do." 
  Annette Ardisson then says: "But the peace plan you are 
referring to -- and we'll come back to it -- is a diplomatic 
plan. I am talking about military action, supposing that the 
Americans are ready to take part in air raids. This isn't very 
clear yet. We have been told since the beginning that this is 
impossible as long as the UN forces, and in particular our UN 
forces, are in Sarajevo, because they could become targets. So 
either we were being lied to before, or else we are ready to 
sacrifice them today." 
  Lamassoure replies: "The French minister wrote to his 
counterparts expressing hope that the NATO meeting will be a 
chance for all the participants, in particular the Americans, to 
approve three things, both political and military, as you said. 
  "First, the Americans have to recognize the validity of the 
European peace plan, which, rather paradoxically, they haven't 
formally done up to now. 
  "Second, to get the Americans to say that they are ready, 
directly, or through NATO, to take part in implementing the 
peace plan as soon as it has been accepted by the three Bosnian 
parties. Then there will be a need for several tens of thousands 
of men on the basis that the peace plan is being applied, that 
the military forces on the ground, the militias, should withdraw 
and disarm, and here too we need a formal American commitment. 
  "Finally, we want the Americans to say in a more solemn 
manner, that they are ready to deploy the means needed to apply 
what is being called UN Resolution No. 836, which provides for 
the possibility of military action by UNPROFOR with air cover, 
should humanitarian convoys be held up by armed forces or should 
the so-called security zones, such as the city of Sarajevo, be 
subjected to shelling." 
  He goes on to elaborate on this, following which Ardisson 
says: 
  "I repeat my question: Is France ready now, given the 
current 
positions of each side, for there to be air strikes around 
Sarajevo on Serb positions?" 
  Lamassoure replies: "The French minister of foreign affairs 
said more than a month ago that France was ready to support the 
request by UNPROFOR should it deem such a thing necessary." He 
repeats that agreement on the modalities was reached several 
months ago. The UN secretary general and NATO must make the 
decision to carry it out, he says. 
  They go on to discuss the partition plan for Bosnia, which 
Lamassoure reluctantly supports. "At this NATO summit," he 
says, "we, Europeans and Americans together, are applying as 
much pressure as possible, to see that the sides should take the 
final step we are expecting from them. And we are speaking to 
each one. We are telling the Serbs: If you go on shelling 
Sarajevo, you can expect air strikes. We are telling the 
Croats: If, in turn, you behave like aggressors, you will suffer 
sanctions of the kind we have been applying against the Serbs 
for several months. And we are telling the Muslims: If you 
don't want peace either, watch out, because our patience has its 
limits." 
  Ardisson then asks him what he thinks about the possibility 
of European action in general without the United States. 
Lamassoure says it is time to reconsider the sharing out of 
roles in the defense of America. Europe still needs the 
Americans, he says, because there are still threats there. But 
for many of the crises, the Europeans should do without U.S. 
leadership. 
  Lamoussoure concludes the interview by saying that he 
expects 
to see an agreement between the Atlantic alliance and the WEU.

  [Excerpts] Paris, Jan 10 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali reacted cautiously Monday [10 January] after 
U.S. President Bill Clinton at the NATO summit in Brussels threw 
his weight behind NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. 
  "A statement by President Clinton is not enough...we must 
wait and see what resolutions are adopted in Brussels and on 
that basis which decisions will be adopted by the Security 
Council," he told a news conference here. 
  Stressing that the Security Council had the power to order 
action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Butrus-Ghali 
said the it was up to the Security Council "to give a mandate to 
NATO or withhold it," he said. 
  "As long as the (member) states do not want to use force, 
and 
the states do not want to, we only have negotiation as a 
solution and a mediating action that must continue," he went on. 
[passage omitted] 
  Butrus-Ghali, who was speaking after appearing before the 
French parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, repeated that it 
was not up to UN field commanders to ask for authorisation for 
air strikes against bases around Sarajevo. 
  On Friday, the secretary general's spokesman said that 
Butrus-Ghali had refused a request from French General Jean Cot, 
the head of peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia, for 
the decision on air strikes to be delegated to him. 
  Butrus-Ghali said that it was up to his special envoy 
responsible for military and humanitarian operations, and also 
depended on Geneva negotiations set to resume on January 18.

  [Text] Bosnia was one of the main topics discussed at the 
National Assembly this afternoon. UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali was the guest of the Assembly's Foreign Affairs 
Commission and of the Commission chairman, Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing. Luc Lemonnier asked the UN secretary general who 
would give the go-ahead should NATO army officials ask for 
permission to use artillery or air strikes against Serbian guns 
in Bosnia. Butrus Butrus-Ghali's answer was as follows: 
  [Begin Butrus-Ghali recording] It is not for the generals to 
ask me for permission, it is for the secretary general's special 
representative, who is responsible for three distinct 
operations. The first is the military operation, the second is 
the humanitarian operation -- we look after 2 million refugees 
-- and the third corresponds to the negotiations which are 
currently under way in Geneva, or which may take place in Bonn 
over the next few days. Everything is contingent upon these 
three elements. 
  If the secretary general's special representative asks, I 
will be only too pleased to accept this request. The political 
power belongs to the Security Council, which gives a mandate. 
The Security Council may give a mandate to NATO, just as it may 
not give any mandate. The decision lies with the Security 
Council, i,e., the 15 members of the Security Council; i.e., the 
five permanent members who have a right of veto. They are the 
ones who will decide. [end recording]

  [Text] At the NATO summit in Brussels, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton asked his European partners to take military action in 
Bosnia against the Serbs if the situation in Sarajevo, the 
capital, does not improve. 
  As for President Mitterrand, he called on the Atlantic 
alliance to give concrete expression to pledges to Bosnia 
through actions, in particular UN resolutions on the protection 
of UN soldiers. 
  Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said that, if a 
solution is to be found, it can only be a political one. He 
spoke to our correspondent in Brussels, Quentin Dickinson: 
  [Begin recording] [Dehaene] It is clear that a solution in 
Yugoslavia will either be a political one, or there will be no 
solution at all. There is no such thing as a purely military 
solution because if a durable solution is to be found, there 
must be an agreement between the various parties. 
  However, when no rule is being respected, when no agreement 
is being respected, I believe that it is necessary to step up 
pressure, probably by increasing sanctions and by using relevant 
means in order to have the UN resolutions enforced on the 
ground, possibly by demanding an air force, as was planned at 
some stage. In any case, if we demand the enforcement of the 
resolutions, it is also necessary to draw conclusions. 
  [Dickinson] Air strikes? 
  [Dehaene] I think it is a means we should be able to use. If 
we say that we want all UN resolutions to be enforced, it is one 
of the consequences. Or else it is better not to say that.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller and Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION in </F>
Brussels] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister seized the initiative at the NATO 
summit early today with a dramatic new plan to bomb Serb 
positions if they continue to thwart the United Nations 
humanitarian operation in Bosnia. 
  He is calling on NATO leaders to agree to a tough 
declaration 
warning the Serbs they will face air attacks unless they give 
way in two key areas. 
  The bold proposal is designed to restore NATO's credibility 
in the Bosnian crisis, step up the West's military pressure and 
appease French demands for nothing short of full-scale bombing 
raids. 
  Mr Major highlighted the problems in the Muslim enclave of 
Srebrenica where Serbs are preventing the replacement of 300 
Canadian troops by a Dutch force and their refusal to allow the 
airport at Tuzla to be reopened. 
  His proposal urges that plans be drawn up to ensure the 
replacement of the Canadian forces and to examine how Tuzla 
airport can be reopened. 
  "If, despite knowing in advance air support was available, 
troops attempted to stop that from happening, then we would use 
air support -- i.e., we would use air cover aggresively to 
achieve our objectives," said a British source. 
  Throughout the two-day NATO summit the French have been 
pressing for punitive air strikes across Bosnia, but Mr Major 
warned there could be serious consequences unless these were 
carefully thought through. 
  But French president Francois Mitterrand was among the first 
to back Mr Major's proposal which will be formally tabled for 
endorsement by the alliance later today. 
  The biggest stumbling block will be U.S. approval after 
President Bill Clinton warned the summit against continued empty 
threats against the Serbs. 
  But British sources appeared optimistic that the Americans 
would sign up to the proposal. 
  The Allies are determined to open the Tuzla airport as its 
closure is severely hampering the humanitarian operation in 
northern Bosnia. 
  And there is widespread anger at the Serbs' refusal to allow 
the 300 Canadian troops out of Srebrenica at the end of their 
six-month tour of duty which was supposed to end just before 
Christmas. 
  A Dutch contingent is ready to replace them, but the Serbs 
have blocked all attempts to move them in. 
  The NATO declaration will also re-emphasise NATO's 
commitment 
to use warplanes to break the stranglehold on Sarajevo if the 
situation in the Bosnian capital becomes untenable. 
  A large allied air force is poised for action at bases in 
Italy and on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic. 
  Britain has a squadron of Jaguar attack jets at Gioia del 
Colle in Italy and eight Sea Harrier jump-jets aboard the 
carrier Invincible.

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>
  [Excerpt] Prime Minister John Major claimed victory at the 
NATO summit in Brussels today as the Allies adopted his bold new 
plan for selective air strikes against the Serbs. 
  The prime minister was able to forget his domestic troubles 
briefly as the two-day meeting of NATO leaders ended with a 
renewed readiness to break the Serb stranglehold on Sarajevo and 
other threatened areas. 
  Mr. Major launched the initiative late last night to break 
the deadlock over NATO's next move to try to restore lasting 
peace in the former Yugoslavia. 
  "We have got everything we wanted, this has been a triumph, 
a 
success," senior British Government sources said after other 
NATO countries backed Mr. Major and included a reference to 
increased action in Bosnia if necessary. 
  The NATO summit's final declaration reaffirmed last August's 
pledge to carry out air strikes in principle. 
  But it also went further, urging the authorities commanding 
United Nations forces in Bosnia to draw up urgent plans to get 
besieged Canadian troops out of the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica 
and open the airport at Tuzla to restore humanitarian relief. 
  The bold proposal is designed to restore NATO's credibility 
in the Bosnian crisis, step up the West's military pressure, and 
appease French demands for nothing short of full-scale bombing 
raids. 
  Mr. Major highlighted the problems in the Muslim enclave of 
Srebrenica, where Serbs are preventing Dutch troops replacing 
300 Canadian troops, and the Serbs' refusal to allow the airport 
at Tuzla to be reopened. 
  The Allies are determined to open Tuzla airport as its 
closure is severely hampering humanitarian operations in 
northern Bosnia. 
  There is also widespread anger at the Serbs' refusal to 
allow 
the Canadian troops out of Srebrenica after a six-month tour of 
duty which was supposed to have ended just before Christmas. 
  The Serbs have blocked all attempts to move in the Dutch 
contingent which is waiting to replace the Canadians. 
  The NATO declaration will also re-emphasise the alliance's 
commitment to use warplanes to break the stranglehold on 
Sarajevo if the situation in the Bosnian capital becomes 
untenable. 
  A large allied air force is poised for action at bases in 
Italy and on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic. 
  Britain has a squadron of Jaguar attack jets at Gioia del 
Colle in Italy and eight Sea Harrier jump-jets aboard the 
carrier Invincible. 
  NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said it was his 
understanding that the declaration meant that the allies would 
use air strikes if Serb forces continued to besiege Srebrenica 
and keep the airport at Tuzla closed. 
  "What I see is a stronger determination to implement (air 
strikes) and to get rid of obstacles," he said. 
  "It is my impression that there is a clear determination not 
to continue just the situation as it stands. I am not able to 
say any more at this very moment." 
  Mr. Woerner said NATO was entering "a new era of 
cooperation." He also referred to a key passage in the summit 
declaration which states: "We expect and would welcome NATO 
expansion that would reach to democratic states to our east as 
part of an evolutionary process taking into account political 
and security developments in the whole of Europe." 
  The summit was an historic turning point, he said. "NATO's 
transformation has made a big step forward. We are now well on 
track to the 21st century." 
  The emerging democracies in Central and East Europe, 
including Russia, were being invited to forge closer military 
links with the 16-nation alliance under a U.S. initiative called 
Partnership for Peace. 
  This was described as an evolutionary process which could 
eventually lead to full membership for a number of countries. 
  "The offer is there -- the door is open," Mr. Woerner said. 
"I call on our cooperation partners to seize this opportunity 
to build a relationship with NATO." 
  The summit also agreed to take urgent action to protect 
against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as 
nuclear missiles around the world. 
  It also saw a reaffirmation from U.S. President Bill Clinton 
of America's commitment to Europe's security. 
  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said that U.S. commitment had 
not been in doubt but it was nice to hear it repeated at NATO 
headquarters for those concerned that transatlantic ties were 
loosening. 
  Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown welcomed NATO's 
tougher 
stand on Bosnia -- but said it was far too late. 
  He told BBC Radio: "Those of us who have been calling for 
this kind of stronger action for 18 months have been constantly 
ridiculed and told it was impossible. 
  "Now because the Americans say it is OK, the Government says 
it is fine." 
  He warned: "Because this has been done so late the exercise 
will be much more risky, much more dangerous, much more 
difficult than it would have been 18 months ago chiefly because 
our troops are embroiled and enmeshed in the operation."

<F P=106> [Interview with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F>
correspondent Nick Gowing in Brussels on 10 January; from the 
Channel Four newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Gowing] Do you agree with President Clinton that 
NATO has to be prepared to carry out its threatened air strikes? 
  [Hurd] We said in August, and we are going to repeat again 
tomorrow, that if our forces are attacked or if the 
strangulation of Sarajevo were resumed, then NATO would be 
willing to use air power in support of the United Nations, and 
that is absolutely right, and I can conceive and you can 
conceive the circumstances in which it would be useful to do 
that. But you do it if it is going to help, you plan ahead, not 
just the one strike but what happens after that, who is going to 
lose their lives, who is going to be at risk, what purpose is 
going to be served. I can conceive of circumstances in which 
the alliance decides to go ahead, and that is what Mr. Clinton 
was saying we must be prepared to do. 
  [Gowing] Is the talk of withdrawal -- even the consideration 
itself becoming a new dynamic as you try pursue peace, in other 
words the warring factions now working for the moment when they 
expect your forces to leave? 
  [Hurd] No decisions have been taken and no decisions will be 
taken by us unilaterally without consulting those who are in the 
same position as we are, this is a joint effort and we need to 
consider its future jointly. The question is not yet answered 
but it is a perfectly reasonably one to put, we have to look at 
after this winter is over, for the winter we are committed and 
would be quite wrong to withdraw during the winter. But when 
the spring comes are we going to say in effect: We are willing 
to continue this commitment for ever? Well the answer to that 
question will depend on what the situation looks like then. 
  [Gowing] Could I ask very briefly on the enlargement of NATO 
or the possibility of enlargement, what about the -- what some 
people are saying that you are simply appeasing the Russians, 
particularly because Yeltsin, when you were here two years ago, 
wrote a request saying he would like Russia to join NATO 
eventually. 
  [Hurd] It is not a question of appeasing Russia. We are 
saying to countries like Poland, Hungary, and the Czechs: You 
want to join NATO, first of all let us have a partnership. What 
does that mean? It means working out with them, cooperation in 
things like training, joint exercises, joint planning, let us 
get to work on that, see how we work together, and then maybe at 
the end of the day there will be full membership, and each 
country will respond to these limitations that have been signed 
today in a different way, and we will be able, as time passes, 
to assess progress with them, and to work out full membership, 
timing, terms when that is right. 
  [Gowing] How happy do you believe the Russians will be about 
your offer, your invitation which President Clinton will take, 
do you expect them to accept this? 
  [Hurd] Yes, I do expect them to accept it. I think it would 
be shortsighted of them not to; it is a big opportunity for 
them, too. This is not aimed against them; it is an invitation 
issued to them along with others, and I very much hope they will 
take it up. 
  [Gowing] Even after all the bluster of complaint and 
concern? 
  [Hurd] Well I would not use the word bluster. Russia is 
rethinking its role in Europe as a result of the collapse of the 
Soviet Union. It is not surprising that should take time, it is 
not indeed surprising that there should be something of a 
backlash in Russian elections with Mr. Zhirinovskiy, but he does 
not make policy he is not the government, it is the government 
with which we have to deal, they are rethinking policy, we have 
to take some account of that, it does not mean giving him a 
veto, and I think the Partnership for Peace strikes the right 
balance.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Mackler] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, Jan 11 (AFP) -- NATO leaders seeking to 
restore the tattered credibility of their Bosnia policy Tuesday 
[11 January] backed a Franco-British proposal for urgent action, 
including air strikes, to free up two Serb-blocked areas. 
  They called on UN military officials to urgently draft plans 
for the relief of a Canadian contingent trapped in the eastern 
Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica and to reopen the northeastern 
airport of Tuzla. 
  They also reaffirmed their pledge made in August to use air 
power if requested by the United Nations to break the Serb siege 
of Sarajevo and other Moslem communities in the former Yugoslav 
republic. 
  The calls came in a communique issued after a two-day summit 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation that saw the Bosnian 
conflict haunt NATO's efforts to build a new European security 
order. 
  Britain and France proposed Monday that NATO offer tactical 
air support to allow Dutch UN Protection Force troops to relieve 
some 300 Canadians blocked for six months by Serbs in Srebrenica. 
  They also called for warplanes to open the Tuzla airport, a 
key access point for relief deliveries to central Bosnia that 
has been blocked by Serb shelling since May 1992 and is 
currently guarded by Nordic UN troops. 
  "We urge the UNPROFOR authorities to draw up urgently plans 
to ensure that the blocked rotation of the UNPROFOR contingent 
in Srebrenica can take place and to examine how the airport at 
Tuzla can be opened for humanitarian relief purposes," the 
communique said. 
  NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner confirmed that the 
call included the possible use of NATO warplanes if requested by 
the United Nations and reflected a desire for tougher Western 
action in the 21-month-old conflict. 
  "I see a stronger determination to implement UN resolutions 
and get rid of the obstacles," he told a news conference. "My 
impression is that there is a clear determination not to just 
continue the situation as it stands." 
  Woerner said NATO had the capacity to act effectively in 
Bosnia. "The main thing is still the political will and 
determination of member countries to use it." 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton said he backed the 
Franco-British 
proposal knowing full well that it could involve the use of U.S. 
air power. He also reiterated his warning against NATO making 
idle threats, adding "we should not say things that we do not 
intend to do." 
  NATO military officials stressed that air power was of only 
limited effectiveness against artillery and it would be 
extremely difficult to keep Tuzla airport open only with 
warplanes. 
  "These two are classic cases where over a sustained period 
of 
time one of the parties has not allowed UNPROFOR (the UN 
Protection Force) to perform its duties," said a British 
official, who asked not to be named. 
  A French official, who also requested anonymity, said the 
credibility of the West and UNPROFOR's mission to protect relief 
operations in the former Yugoslav republic was at stake. 
  "The 16 (NATO members) do not want to make war, but we are 
not ready to let local factions do what they want," he said. 
Officials said the proposal received support at a dinner 
meeting of the government chiefs Monday. 
  Britain and other countries were opposed to air strikes 
around Sarajevo, fearing they could unleash a chain of reprisals 
and endanger the lives of UN troops on the ground. 
  The West's inability to take effective action intruded on 
the 
summit here aimed at opening a new chapter in NATO's 45-year 
history by offering military links with the old East Bloc as a 
prelude to eventual enlargement. 
  On Monday the summit launched a Partnership for Peace 
programme that would provide for joint military planning, 
training, and other activities and give the Eastern states the 
right to NATO consultations in crisis. 
  But, in the face of strong opposition by Russia, the scheme 
stops short of promising automatic membership to participants as 
eagerly sought by countries such as Poland, Hungary and the 
Czech Republic.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 11 (AFP) -- Here are the main points 
of the communique issued by NATO leaders Tuesday [11 January] at 
the end of their two-day summit: 
  MEMBERSHIP: "We expect and would welcome NATO expansion that 
would reach to democratic states to our East, as part of an 
evolutionary process, taking into account political and security 
developments in the whole of Europe." 
  EAST-WEST MILITARY TIES: Launched Partnership for Peace, "an 
immediate and practical programme that will transform the 
relationship between NATO and participating states." Offers 
former Soviet bloc states and other "able and willing" countries 
cooperation in planning and joint exercises as well as crisis 
consultations. "Active participation in the Partnership for 
Peace will play an important role in the evolutionary process of 
the expansion of NATO." 
  BOSNIA: "We reaffirm our readiness, under the authority of 
the United Nations Security Council and in accordance with the 
alliance decisions of 2 and 9 August 1993, to carry out air 
strikes in order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the 
safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "In this context, we urge the UNPROFOR authorities to draw 
up 
urgently plans to ensure that the blocked rotation of the 
UNPROFOR contingent in Srebrenica can take place and to examine 
how the airport at Tuzla can be opened for humanitarian relief 
purposes." 
  EUROPEAN DEFENSE IDENTITY: "The emergence of a European 
Security and Defence Identity will strengthen the European 
pillar of the alliance while reinforcing the transatlantic link 
and will enable the European Allies to take greater 
responsibility for their common security and defence." 
  ASSETS SHARING: "We therefore stand ready to make collective 
assets of the alliance available, on the basis of consultations 
in the North Atlantic Council, for WEU (Western European Union) 
operations undertaken by the European Allies in pursuit of their 
Common Foreign and Security Policy." 
  COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCES: Endorses a plan to create new 
"separable but not separate" multinational command units that 
could be detached from the main NATO structure for operations 
without U.S. participation if needed. The joint task forces 
could also be used for operations "with participating nations 
outside the alliance." 
  NON-PROLIFERATION: Pledges to "intensify and expand" NATO 
efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction which "constitute a threat to international 
security." Orders work on an overall policy framework "to 
consider how to reinforce ongoing prevention efforts and how to 
reduce the proliferation threat and protect against it."

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 11 (AFP) -- French President Francois 
Mitterrand on Tuesday [11 January] emphasised NATO's 
"determination to eliminate obstacles" preventing the UN 
Protection Force from accomplishing its mandate in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He told a press conference at the end of the summit that 
"actions are planned to open the airport at Tuzla (northeast 
Bosnia) and allow the relief of UNPROFOR troops in Srebenica," 
the Moslem enclave where a Canadian contingent has been trapped 
for six months. 
  He said Britain and France had put forward the proposal to 
take concrete action. The proposal was added on Tuesday morning 
to the text of the final declaration and adopted unanimously, he 
said. 
  Mitterrand said the wording had been drawn up by British 
Prime Minister John Major and French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe and checked by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  Mitterrand refused to specify what kind of action was 
envisaged, saying that it was "not usual" to make such 
information available for security reasons. 
  "We can no longer count on the goodwill of the three warring 
parties and the first duty of the United Nations forces is to 
ensure the safety of their comrades engaged in peacekeeping 
activities. That will be the case in Srebenica and at Tuzla 
Airport." 
  Last August NATO announced it would resort to air strikes to 
protect UN troops on the ground and in Moslem safe areas if the 
United Nations formally requested it.

<F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is </F>
in Brussels, by Jean-Marie Cavada from the France-2 studio in 
Paris--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Cavada] I would like to look at the results of 
the first part of the summit in Brussels. [passage omitted] 
Today was the first part of the Brussels NATO summit, which 
will continue tomorrow. 
  Mr. Juppe, at France's request the Bosnian issue has at last 
been discussed. Do the Americans and the French agree on air 
strikes? Which ones? Against whom and by whom, Mr. Juppe? 
  [Juppe] Mr. Cavada, like everyone else, I am deeply 
distressed by what I know and what I see. [passage omitted] It 
is necessary to put pressure on all parties today in order to 
convince them that there is no military solution and that the 
only solution is a political settlement. 
  What have we tried to do at this alliance summit? First, we 
spoke about Yugoslavia. It had been decided that 16 heads of 
state and government would gather to discuss security and 
stability in Europe, while setting Yugoslavia aside. But, 
because France said last week that this was inconceivable, we 
talked about Yugoslavia today. 
  We obtained three things, which will be included in 
tomorrow's final declaration. They may seem insignificant to 
those who are listening to us, but they are important for the 
future. 
  First, we managed to have the 16 countries of the Atlantic 
alliance approve the peace plan of the European Union. We are 
often told that there is no political aim. I am sorry, but 
there is a political aim. The aim is peace, as fair a peace as 
possible. We Europeans have committed ourselves to this. We 
said: This is the plan we suggest. I discussed this plan 
myself with Mr. Izetbegovic. I remember very well the moment 
when, in Geneva, on 29 November 1993 I asked him: What do you 
want? He wrote on a piece of paper before my eyes: 33.3 percent 
of Bosnian territory. This is what he said. 
  So this is what we suggested: 17.5 percent for the Croats, 
33.3 percent for the Muslims, and the rest for the Serbs. There 
are many other aspects to this plan: access to the sea, the 
international status of Sarajevo, the European status of Mostar, 
access to the Sava River and the Danube in the north. Anyway, 
the plan is on the table, and we are now in a position to say: 
The 16 countries of the Atlantic alliance are telling all the 
parties that this is the plan which must now be approved and 
accepted. There will be no other. 
  The second thing we obtained, and this is very important, is 
the commitment of the 16 to contribute to the enforcement on the 
ground in Bosnia, by sending troops to implement this plan if it 
is approved. I say to those who are listening to us in 
Sarajevo: President Clinton himself, and the other heads of 
state and government, said today: If peace is signed, we will 
go to Bosnia with NATO soldiers to guarantee the enforcement [of 
the plan]. It is a solemn commitment. 
  Finally, the third thing we obtained is that the Atlantic 
alliance says it is ready to support the UN in enforcing 
Security Council resolutions. This means two things in concrete 
terms. 
  First, as Francois Leotard and General Briquemont have said, 
it is necessary to reinforce UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
troops. For months on end we were told that an extra 7,000 men 
would be dispatched. France did its duty and sent 1,000. Where 
are the others? As early as tomorrow, we will meet UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali in Paris, and we shall say to him: Where 
are the others? They must come. 
  The second aspect of this commitment on NATO's part is to 
say: If UNPROFOR is attacked, if it cannot carry out the mission 
it was given by the Security Council, then we are available for 
air strikes. At the initiative of France once again, with our 
partners who have troops on the ground, we have tried to define 
more precisely the operations we could undertake in order to 
restore UNPROFOR's credibility. 
  As Francois Leotard explained earlier--and I will be 
brief--the first intervention is to force open the road to 
Srebrenica to relieve Canadian troops, and the second is to open 
Tuzla airport so that humanitarian aid can land there. We warn 
those who might want to oppose these two operations that if they 
do so, air strikes will be used. As I am talking to you, while 
heads of state and governments are still discussing this, this 
is the outcome of today's talks in Brussels.

<F P=106> [Interview with Western European Union (WEU) Secretary </F>
General Willem van Eekelen by Leonardo Malsano in Brussels; date 
not given: "`Three Reasons for a Success'"; first paragraph is 
IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Text] Brussels -- "It will be a success, a fantastic 
success, a turning point in the policy of the Atlantic 
alliance." Willem van Eekelen, the former Netherlands defense 
minister and general secretary of the WEU [Western European 
Union], which in Maastricht found the fertile ground allowing it 
to liberate itself from an uncertain political and military 
arrangement to grow into the "armed wing" of Europe, is exultant 
about the outcome of a summit that, for the most part, had 
already been predicted. 
  [Malsano] Why a success? 
  [van Eekelen] Great progress was made in three areas: the 
adoption by NATO of greater flexibility in its internal 
structures; giving the WEU permission to use the structure of 
the Atlantic alliance; and the Partnership for Peace aimed at 
benefiting the countries of Central and East Europe. The first 
and second points are interrelated and have a precise 
significance: The summit will open the road to the creation of 
multinational interarmy groups. This means putting at our 
disposal (the Western European Union comprises the Twelve except 
for Ireland and Denmark, whereas Greece has to finalize its 
parliamentary ratification in order to gain full membership -- 
IL GIORNALE editor's note) the NATO headquarters for these 
operations which are the responsibility of Europe alone. 
  [Malsano] So this is the theory of the "two caps," which 
says 
that the NATO structures could, from time to time, be put at the 
WEU's service. 
  [van Eekelen] Exactly. This is the hypothesis on which I 
have worked for years, and which will put NATO in charge of 
collective defense and us in charge of undertaking our missions. 
However, the aspect that must be emphasized is the political 
rather than military. This summit will lead to a full and 
unconditional "yes" by the Americans regarding the existence of 
the WEU, a "yes" that had never been clearly stated in the past. 
In the second place, the United States acknowledges that there 
could be scenarios in which ground forces would not participate, 
as is the case in Bosnia now. This facilitates cooperation, and 
makes everyone more flexible -- including NATO, which in the 
event of noninvolvement by the United States in military 
operations, could offer its bases to the WEU, which, in turn, 
would not have to worry about creating new logistical structures 
but could use already existing ones. Lastly, it lets everyone 
save some money. It is truly a fundamental step in the 
transformation of the Atlantic alliance. 
  [Malsano] Does it not seem to you to be the gradual 
withdrawal of the U.S. commitment from the European stage? 
  [van Eekelen] There is a mutation under way in the 
geopolitical scene. The United States is primarily interested 
in Russia and there is nothing wrong with that. We Europeans, 
of course, cannot deal with Moscow alone; we need NATO for that. 
  [Malsano] Does the go-ahead which the summit will give to 
the 
creation of multinational interarmy groups put an end to the 
plan to develop Eurocorps (French, German, Spanish, and Belgian 
troops which are already organized in a common structure -- IL 
GIORNALE editor's note)? 
  [van Eekelen] Eurocorps is at NATO's disposal for collective 
defense and at WEU's disposal for our missions. It is not the 
seed of the future European Army, but just one of the elements 
in the WEU, as are the multinational interarmy groups. In this 
connection, it must be said that the summit will only give the 
general consensus, the political approval. Subsequently, we 
must define the technical aspects, and the methods that will 
enable the WEU to have access to the alliance's logistical 
structures. 
  [Malsano] One of the reasons that you predicted for the 
summit's success was the Partnership for Peace -- the 
cooperation and collaboration agreement that will bring the 
countries of Central and East Europe closer to NATO. In 
reality, the expectations of the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and 
Slovaks were disregarded to a great extent. Do you too think 
that it was not possible to concede more? 
  [van Eekelen] Of course, the countries of Central and East 
Europe will be disappointed, but the leaders of the alliance 
adopted a realistic approach. The Western world cannot say, as 
has happened for quite some time, that Russia is no longer a 
threat and therefore give guarantees to the other countries 
vis-a-vis Moscow. I believe that this is a fair decision: It 
does not create new borders in Europe and it develops the 
military cooperation that will be extremely useful in view of 
future membership. The West made a mistake in letting too many 
expectations arise. Moreover, the most important problem in 
Central and East Europe is economic, not military. These 
countries must be allowed to grow progressively closer to the 
European Union, to become members of it, and then to be able to 
join the WEU and perhaps NATO too. In today's global context, 
one cannot think solely in terms of defense and security, there 
must also be political convergence in accordance with the logic 
of European integration. In this kind of scenario, Russia would 
perhaps no longer have any reason to object. On the contrary, 
the mere fact of any former members of the Warsaw Pact joining 
NATO, which was and still is an instrument of the Cold War in 
people's minds, would be viewed by Moscow as a hostile act. 
  [Malsano] What you are presenting is an indefinite slide. 
Can the countries of Central and East Europe afford to wait for 
a long time? 
  [van Eekelen] They will need six, maybe eight years, but 
these countries must be given the prospect of European 
integration. This is a multistage path that leads to a gradual 
rapprochement and builds the foundation for a future that is 
somewhat more solid than what could be offered by mere 
guarantees of security.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton's Lack of Will"] </F>
  [Text] On the first day of the NATO summit in Brussels, 
President Clinton said the alliance should not issue warnings 
about military action against the Serbs without intending to 
follow them up. However he gave no indication that members 
would be any more ready to act than they have been since August, 
when NATO threatened air strikes to relieve the siege of 
Sarajevo. As expected, what we are hearing from the summit is 
fine words about new partnerships for peace in East Europe but a 
reluctance to deal with the most obvious source of instability 
in the region. Perhaps, at heart, the President does not 
consider the war in Bosnia to be a direct American concern; his 
unwelcome enthusiasm for further political integration on this 
side of the Atlantic suggests that he would prefer Europeans to 
unite in sorting out the continent's problems on their own. 
  In domestic political terms, Mr Clinton can perhaps afford 
to 
keep his distance from the Balkans. He can hardly do the same 
with the threat posed by North Korea's advancing nuclear 
programme; countering proliferation is one of the main planks of 
his foreign policy, and an American infantry division is 
deployed between Seoul and the North Korean border. Yet the 
same lack of will is painfully apparent. The main 
protagonists--the United States, China, Japan and South 
Korea--obviously dread the idea of Pyongyang's actually using a 
nuclear bomb. But their actions suggest that mere possession of 
nuclear materiel might, at a pinch, be tolerable. All concerned 
hope that they can keep the situation within manageable bounds. 
South Korea fears that precipitate disintegration of its 
northern neighbour will result in a reunification process even 
more debilitating than was Germany's. Despite their frequent 
irritation with the unpredictable Kim Il-song, both China and 
Japan regard a divided Korea as easier to deal with than a 
united peninsula. 
  The main casualty of such cynicism towards the international 
non- proliferation regime is the credibility of American foreign 
policy. The United States has retreated from President Clinton's 
fiery rhetoric of last July--when he vowed the destruction of 
North Korea if it used a nuclear device--to actions that suggest 
that almost any deal is worthwhile. Having declared then that 
no inducements would be offered to Pyongyang until it fulfilled 
its international obligations, the Administration is now 
offering a string of concessions. In so doing, it has 
undermined the International Atomic Energy Agency's insistence 
on regular "challenge" inspections of undeclared sites. 
  Thus, both in Europe and Asia, Mr Clinton's much vaunted 
emphasis on economic security is being undermined by his 
reluctance to act decisively to safeguard political-military 
security.

  [Text] The Prime Minister today announced limited 
ministerial changes in the House of Lords following the 
resignation of the Earl of Caithness as Minister of State, 
Transport, after the death of his wife. 
  Mr Major has contained the changes so as to disturb as 
little 
as possible the ministerial structure in the Lords. 
  Lord Caithness's portfolio will be undertaken at the lower 
level of Under-Secretary, by Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, 
promoted from the Whips' Office. 
  Lord Mackay, 55, as Mr John Mackay, sat in the House of 
Commons from 1979 to 1987, first as MP [Member of Parliament] 
for Argyll and later for the redrawn constituency of Argyll and 
Bute. 
  The resignation also gives Mr Major an opportunity to 
promote 
Lord Strathclyde, 33, from Under-Secretary to Minister of State 
at the Department of Trade and Industry. 
  Lady Denton, 58, becomes Under-Secretary Northern Ireland, 
swapping jobs with the Earl of Arran, 55, who becomes 
Under-Secretary, Environment. Downing Street declined to give a 
reason for this exchange of posts. 
  A new whip, to replace Lord Mackay, will be announced later.

  [Text] A joint Army and police base in Northern Ireland was 
rocked by an explosion early today (Tuesday). 
  A number of people were injured in the blast at the base at 
Crossmaglen, South Armagh, at around 12.20 am. 
  No further details about the casualties were immediately 
available, the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] said. 
  Yesterday evening a mortar bomb exploded at the base. 
  No-one was injured in that attack, but the area around the 
heavily-fortified post was sealed off while Army bomb experts 
carried out a search. The base was not evacuated. 
  Later an RUC spokesman said the blast came as military 
personnel were attempting to recover the vehicle used in the 
earlier mortar bomb attack. 
  The explosion happened inside the base. It is believed two 
soldiers were injured in the attack, but the extent of their 
injuries is not yet known.

  [Excerpts] In a speech at Dublin Castle in the past hour, 
the Taoiseach [prime minister] has appealed for acceptance of 
the Downing Street declaration, which he said provided important 
protection to Unionists and Nationalists at the same time. Many 
of his remarks addressed objections to the declaration that had 
been raised in Republican circles. He recognized it faced them 
with a momentous and historic decision, requiring real 
leadership, courage and conviction. He said the government 
wanted to provide continuing clarification but without putting 
in question the balance of the document. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Reynolds recording] The joint declaration makes it 
clear on behalf of the Irish Government with the endorsement of 
all the constitutional and nationalist parties that it would be 
wrong to impose a united Ireland in the absence of the 
freely-given consent of a majority of the people of Northern 
Ireland. Likewise, the democratic right of self-determination 
by the people of Ireland as a whole must be exercised with and 
subject to the agreement and consent of a majority in Northern 
Ireland. Both Governments accept that Irish unity would be 
achieved only by those who favour this outcome, persuading those 
who do not, peacefully and without coercion or violence. [end

<F P=106> [Richard Savill report: "Reynolds Offers To Give </F>
Clarification on Peace Proposals"] 
  [Text] Belfast -- Dublin appeared at odds with London last 
night as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, offered 
to give clarification of the Downing Street peace declaration. 
  His remarks in a keynote speech, almost a month after the 
signing of the declaration, seemed to undermine Mr Major's blunt 
refusal to elaborate on the agreement. 
  Sinn Fein's demands for clarification have been repeatedly 
dismissed by Downing Street, which has accused the IRA of 
attempting to enter talks without halting its campaign of 
violence. 
  Mr Major's tough line was endorsed yesterday by Mr James 
Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader. 
  Mr Molyneaux said: "Practically every paragraph cancels 
itself out. 
  "Where you have a phrase or a sentence that is repugnant to 
any pro-Union citizen, that is immediately cancelled out in the 
same paragraph by a counterstatement." 
  Mr Reynolds's speech to the Irish Association at Dublin 
Castle was aimed at both nationalists and Unionists and was 
clearly designed to keep the peace process alive. 
  He said the Downing Street document did not provide a 
solution in itself, but was merely the "first step on the road" 
to peace. 
  He made a strong attempt to reassure Unionists, stressing 
that a united Ireland could not be imposed in the absence of the 
"freely given consent" of a majority of people in Ulster. 
  Mr Reynolds added: "Likewise the democratic right of 
self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be 
exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a 
majority in Northern Ireland." 
  He said: "Both governments accept that Irish unity would be 
achieved only by those who favour this outcome, persuading those 
who do not, peacefully and without coercion or violence." 
  An attempt to impose a united Ireland without the consent of 
a majority of Ulster people would be a recipe for instability. 
  And he added: "There can only be a mutual process of 
demilitarisation through confidence building on all sides. 
Continuing violence and conflict is not merely evil, it is 
futile." 
  Mr Reynolds said the declaration, for the first time gave an 
"explicit, rock-solid" guarantee that if a majority in Ulster 
wanted a united Ireland, Britain would uphold that wish. 
  He declared: "The beginning of every new journey holds some 
fears. These can be overcome. The priority must be the 
protection of human life. We want everyone to choose the path 
to peace and turn away from the cul-de-sac of violence." 
  Britain also explicitly acknowledged and agreed to support 
the right of the Irish people to come together in whatever form 
they choose. 
  He added: "British imperialist interest in Ireland is dead, 
even if we still have to resolve some of its legacy." 
  Mr Reynolds also said: "I would appeal to those with whom 
the ultimate decision for peace now lies. Do not let this 
opportunity pass. Do not because of the weight of the past, or 
because of very natural instincts, condemn the people of either 
community to another generation of suffering." 
  Mr Reynolds's speech was made against a background of 
continuing violence. 
  The Ulster Freedom Fighters shot and injured a Roman 
Catholic 
man in West Belfast. 
  And the IRA was blamed for a mortar attack on a joint 
police/Army base at Crossmaglen.

<F P=106> [Report on statements by French President Francois </F>
Mitterrand during interview with AFP on 9 January in Brussels: 
"Francois Mitterrand's New `Neither, Nor'"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  NATO's Role </H5>
  [Mitterrand] There are already several organizations 
responsible for security in Europe: the CSCE, NATO, the Western 
European Union [WEU]. In the political sphere, the Council of 
Europe brings together all the democracies and will probably be 
further expanded. Each organization must play its role, seeking 
complementarity. 
  With the Maastricht Treaty, the European Union [EU] is 
henceforth capable of exercising foreign and security policy 
responsibilities; the French initiative for a Pact for 
Stability, to which it gave approval in December and which will 
bring together all the countries involved in Paris in April, is 
proof of this. 
  The first adaptation which is vital is to take account of 
the 
European identity. 
  Since then, namely last November, the Maastricht Treaty has 
been ratified. For the first time, the European Community, 
which has become the EU, has authority in the sphere of common 
foreign and security policy, and has the aim of acquiring a real 
European defense identity and developing a common defense and 
security policy which, when the time comes, can lead to a real 
common defense. (...) 
  In the framework of the EU, the common foreign and security 
policy, the WEU, and the European corps all fit together. Let 
us not create a problem where no problem exists. Let us move 
forward: This is in the interests of the Alliance and of the 
Europeans. 
  We French will approach the summit with the desire to carry 
out a far-reaching discussion which will then enable the 
diplomats and experts to translate into practical terms the 
guidelines and principles on which we will have agreed. 
  This means that France, a full member of the Alliance, will 
have its full place in it. Our special military position within 
NATO, which there is no reason to change, presents no new 
problem either for us or for our allies who are fully aware of 
the reasons for it. 
<H5>  Relations Between NATO and the WEU </H5>
  Placing NATO's resources at the WEU's disposal could be an 
important development, provided there is a detailed examination 
of the methods and practical provisions. This cannot be the end 
result. 
  In our view, what is essential is that NATO and the WEU, 
which will act on the Twelve's behalf, are able to fulfill their 
missions without there being one organization dependent on 
another (which would be contrary to the principle of 
complementarity), or any competition between them which would 
result in wastage and pointless duplication. The discussions in 
progress should make it possible for the two organizations to 
resort, in full agreement, to the resources available, after the 
information and mutual consultation procedures have been decided. 
  As we have shown with the European corps, there is no 
conflict between the development of the WEU and NATO, provided 
it is accepted that missions other than those stemming from 
Article 5 of NATO are defined, planned, and implemented 
according to specific ad hoc procedures in keeping with their 
particular nature. Recent experience proves that peace keeping 
requires a constant adaptation of military structures to the 
objectives of each mission. From this viewpoint, the integrated 
military organization is not showing all the flexibility one 
would wish. 
<H5>  France and NATO </H5>
  There will be no return to the NATO integrated military 
command. With regard to the former Yugoslavia, particularly 
Bosnia, because the French have the largest number of troops 
there, in December 1992 I authorized French officers to 
participate in the work of the general staff being carried out 
at the time with a view to NATO being given a mandate, in the 
context of the UN resolutions, to guarantee the enforcement of a 
peaceful settlement and to make some areas "safe." Finally, 
NATO has so far not intervened and those plans have therefore 
not been implemented. 
  However, what I accepted in 1992 could be applied if 
necessary to other peace keeping missions and in the same 
conditions, in other words, when French troops are involved, 
provided a French decision to engage our troops has been made by 
the competent national authorities. This can only be decided 
case by case. The defense minister and the chief of staff will 
then be able to participate in meetings during which the said 
mission would be planned. All this has nothing to do with a 
return to the integrated commands, because these peace keeping 
missions would form part of procedures separate from those 
resulting from Article 5. 
  The peace keeping role adopted by NATO is merely one 
hypothesis. It does not have a monopoly of this role. This is 
merely an observation. 
<H6>  Political Identity </H6>
<H5>  European Nuclear Doctrine </H5>
  You are referring to the remarks which I made immediately 
after the conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty creating the EU. 
The urgency of the subject will increase as the EU establishes 
its political identity at the same time as its security and 
defense identity. This will probably take time, but we must not 
lose sight of it. However, there will only be a European 
nuclear doctrine, a European deterrence doctrine, when there are 
vital European interests, regarded as such by the Europeans but 
also understood as such by others. 
  You can see that there is a long way to go here. France will 
not dilute its national defense resources in this sphere on any 
pretext. Whatever happens, there cannot be some "replacement" -- 
to use your term -- of the United States. This question does 
not arise, the U.S. military involvement in Europe remains at 
the center of the trans-Atlantic link and hence of the Alliance. 
<H5>  French Nuclear Tests </H5>
  I decided on a test moratorium after calling on the 
Americans, Russians, and British to do likewise -- that was in 
April 1992 -- because we had achieved -- according to all our 
experts -- the adequacy which guaranteed the credibility of our 
deterrent. Mr. Bush, Mr. Yeltsin, and Mr. Major said yes to me. 
In 1993, President Clinton asked to extend that moratorium. 
There was no question of saying no to him because he was 
following the same course as us. Of course, the Chinese, who 
are lagging behind, continued their tests; I hope that they will 
adopt our attitude. I am still fully opposed to a resumption of 
nuclear tests by France, at least while our partners honor their 
pledge. I am discussing that with the prime minister and the 
other ministers involved. 
  Our nuclear deterrent is credible and adequate now and we 
think it will continue to be so for many years. Meanwhile we 
must replace the oldest components. Studies are under way, 
decisions will be made at the appropriate time. Moreover, in 
1992, I made decisions which will give the new-generation 
submarines, decided in 1983, a new missile with a substantially 
improved range. We will continue to work along these lines, 
knowing that this missile could also be installed on the Albion 
Plateau. In this context, we are speeding up, together with the 
prime minister, our simulation program, in other words, 
laboratory tests which must be treated as a great priority. 
  At a time when the whole world is anxious to eliminate the 
threat of nuclear proliferation which threatens everybody, 
France, through its initiative for a test moratorium, has 
greater political, diplomatic, and moral credibility than ever. 
Giving the signal for a new arms race would be contrary to what 
I expect of France. If that leads us to put more time into 
acquiring all the simulation technology, a consideration of the 
world's geopolitical state shows that we have that time. Until 
then our nuclear force will continue to deter anybody who might 
consider threatening us. 
  The parliamentary report is interesting but has not 
convinced 
me. However, on many points, discussion may be beneficial. At 
present, I am carrying out such discussion with the prime 
minister and the relevant ministers and with the members of the 
Defense Council whom I brought together in December and whom I 
will see again before the end of this month. Whatever happens, 
and our interlocutors know this, I have no intention of 
authorizing new nuclear tests. 
<H5>  Security of East European Countries </H5>
  The security need felt by the former members of the Warsaw 
Pact and the now independent states which have emerged from the 
collapse of the Soviet Union is legitimate. Each, whatever its 
size or geographical position, is entitled to security. I have 
constantly said that, especially when I visited the three Baltic 
states in 1992. This is what is enshrined in the Paris Charter, 
for which the CSCE bears responsibility. 
  What are now the most immediate threats to the security of 
the East European states? First, the problems of borders and 
minorities. Establishing the foundations for real security 
based on stability and confidence requires them to be solved. 
It is with this objective that the EU has decided to give a 
favorable reply to the plan put forward by Mr. Balladur to 
organize a conference in 1994 aimed at defusing in advance the 
conflicts which might arise in Europe from new minorities or 
border problems and reaching the conclusion of a Pact for 
Stability. We all know the other alternative, that of the 
collapse of the former Yugoslavia. Lack of foresight and 
impatience precipitated this tragedy. Membership of an Alliance 
would not dispense with the need to solve this problem. Let us 
beware of such illusions. 
  France and Germany have also proposed that the states which 
are already WEU associates, with the prospect of membership, 
acquire a status within the WEU which would meet their security 
expectations. All these initiatives should combine to give the 
continent's security a strong foundation and prevent, through 
negotiation, crises which we would otherwise have every reason 
to fear. In Rome back in 1991, I supported the idea of a 
discussion on this subject with the Central and East European 
countries. 
  I therefore approve of the idea of a "Partnership for Peace" 
to strengthen the security of all the Central and East European 
states.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Isnard: "A New Nuclear Missile on the </F>
Plateau of Albion?"] 
  [Text] For the first time, Francois Mitterrand is not 
ruling out the plan to bury a new missile in the silos of the 
plateau of Albion to replace the S-3D missiles currently there. 
In fact, although he does not give the code name, the French 
president is talking about the MS-5 strategic missile program, 
which is shrouded in the greatest secrecy. This missile would 
be intended to arm both so-called new generation submarines by 
the year 2005 and the silos buried in upper Provence. 
  Since the early 1970's, the plateau of Albion has 
accommodated 18 ground-to-ground missiles capable of carrying a 
1-megaton nuclear payload over a distance of approximately 5,000 
km. These missiles have since been modernized. In view of the 
missiles' aptitude at thwarting -- or not thwarting -- hostile 
defense forces, which have supposedly gained in efficiency in 
the meantime, the missile base of the plateau of Albion could be 
obsolete by the beginning of next century. Hence the current 
debate aimed at determining the weapons system which might 
succeed the one currently deployed on the plateau of Albion. 
  The debate is all about whether France can maintain three 
different systems -- ground-to-ground missiles, sea-to-ground 
missiles, and air-to-ground missiles, as is the case today -- or 
whether it should only maintain two of these -- and, if so, 
determining which system could be abandoned. The answers given 
by the experts vary tremendously. Nothing has been decided as 
yet, and the next military planning law, which will cover the 
years 1995 to 2000, will no doubt judge the merits of the 
different options. 
  Recently, General Vincent Lanata, chief of staff of the Air 
Force whose forces serve the Albion plateau and whose aircraft 
carry air-to-ground missiles, has expressed his wish to have a 
more advanced airborne missile at his disposal. 
  Consequently, Mr. Mitterrand, who sets great store by the 
political and strategic symbol represented by the plateau of 
Albion, has just spoken for the first time about the possibility 
of simultaneously deploying -- both in French submarines and in 
the silos in Provence -- missiles which are based on the same 
basic design but can be adapted to either launch mode. This is 
the program dubbed MS-5, involving a missile with multiple 
warheads and a range of 8,000 km. 
  If this approach were definitively retained, it would 
presuppose that financial priority had already been given to the 
M-5 missile project, the version intended for submarines. 
However, what does one find? Launched in 1992, back when 
Pierre Joxe was defense minister, the program has been slowed 
down by the Balladur government in 1994 [as published], to the 
great displeasure of the missile's constructor, the Aerospatiale 
group, whose CEO, Louis Gallois, has unceasingly maintained that 
the M-5 is of primary interest. The M-5 even figures among the 
projects threatened with being staggered over an even longer 
period -- along with the future transport plane, the antimissile 
defense systems, certain equipment for use in space, and the 
NH-90 logistical helicopter -- if the military planning law 
allocates insufficient funds.

<F P=106> [Interview with Francois Leotard, French minister of state </F>
for defense by correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert; place and 
date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Leotard. You are 
the man of the day for several reasons. First, because you have 
just come back from a lightning trip to Saudi Arabia with 
Edouard Balladur -- without anything very specific, in fact, but 
a lot of promises. Are you dIsappointed? 
  [Leotard] No, no. Not disappointed. With contracts that are 
likely to end up being signed, and which are very large, but 
that was not the only, or major, aim of our visit. We also held 
very important political discussions in that country. 
  [Giesbert] Good. You are also the man of the day because of 
the NATO summit opening in Brussels today. There is going to be 
a lot of talk about Bosnia. By the way, did you see the article 
by Bernard Koucher and Michel Rocard in yesterday's JOURNAL DU 
DIMANCHE? For them, the alternative is simple: Get shooting or 
get out. In other words, humanitarian action is over now; we 
have to move on to military action. 
  [Leotard] Yes. A black and white solution in this sort of 
tragedy -- it is not very responsible to say that. 
  [Giesbert] But before you were a minister, did you not use 
to 
say the same sort of thing? 
  [Leotard] Let me tell you that as far as shooting is 
concerned, we do that when we have to respond. Getting out 
means abandoning the women and children that we are currently 
protecting, the civilian population in other words, giving up 
the French role in that part of the world. It probably means 
allowing the conflagration in the Balkans to spread. So, I do 
not think that the alternative is as brutal, or as simple, if I 
may say so, as that. We are retorting, and we will go on 
retorting still more if we go on being attacked. That is quite 
proper. But at the same time we are holding discussions with 
our partners to see how we can continue to manage the situation 
politically, and not just militarily. 
  [Giesbert] People do not always understand your position 
very 
clearly. One day you raise the question of a withdrawal from 
Bosnia, another day you raise the need for reinforcements, and 
in the end you [word indistinct] on Bosnia. 
  [Leotard] No, you journalists in general are strange. You 
ask if we are going to stay indefinitely, and we say no, because 
we do not stay indefinitely anywhere in the world. Then you 
say: Ah, that means you are going to withdraw? It is obvious 
that one day or other the United Nations forces -- the United 
Nations forces, not just French ones -- will withdraw from 
Bosnia. That is obvious. But we are not going to do it now. 
  [Giesbert] Before becoming a minister you adopted very 
hard-line, very interventionist positions. [words indistinct] 
  [Leotard] Mr. Giesbert, when there were no troops on the 
ground, not a single soldier, and not a single French soldier of 
course, I supported air strikes -- and I remain convinced that I 
was right. Once we have soldiers on the ground, who are 
humanitarian forces, accompanying convoys, let us make sure that 
air strikes -- which one day or other will of course have to be 
made -- do not have even more serious consequences [words 
indistinct]. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, the NATO summit will also deal with 
the problem of the former people's democracies, like Poland, or 
the Czech Republic, who want to join the club. Do you think 
they should be made to wait, and then given a hard time, as is 
happening? 
  [Leotard] I think their movement toward the West, toward us, 
should be done in stages. We suggested to them that they should 
be associated with the WEU, which is our European security 
organization, and today and tomorrow in Brussels we will discuss 
the American formula -- which is not contradictory, in fact -- 
of partnership for peace. 
  In other words, what we want is to bring them in 
progressively, and not all at once, to the security process that 
we Europeans are now constructing. I think this is the right 
way. 
  [Giesbert] I imagine you have read the AFP interview with 
the 
president? [on France not rejoining NATO military command and 
need for nuclear tests] 
  [Leotard] Of course. 
  [Giesbert] Had he shown it to you before? 
  [Leotard] No, and I can tell you that I see him every week 
because that is my job, and we tell each other what each has to 
say on the problems of defense, that is to say, according to our 
responsibilities. There is nothing in the interview that I am 
not aware of, that might worry me. 
  [Giesbert] He rejects a French return to the NATO command. 
You agree with that? 
  [Leotard] Yes. We have always said that. The current 
government shares this position completely. 
  [Giesbert] He also comes out against a resumption of nuclear 
tests. You agree with that too? 
  [Leotard] That is the only point -- and even here he knows 
quite well that we are not in agreement, except in the 
short-term, because in the short-term there is of course no 
threat to our deterrent force, which is perfectly credible. But 
we think, I think, and will go on thinking, that over several 
years, (?as soon as possible) we will have to resume testing 
with a very specific aim, namely so that France can acquire 
simulation techniques. We cannot get these techniques -- which 
will make it possible for us to do without tests to a large 
extent -- without holding some today, precisely in order to 
acquire this technology -- as the Americans have done, 
incidentally, in the past few years and months. 
  So that is the only point, but he is very well aware of the 
government's position and his own. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Alain Baron: "Balladur in Riyadh: No Decision </F>
on Major Contracts"] 
  [Text] Paris and Riyadh failed to sign a framework 
agreement yesterday during the official visit by Edouard 
Balladur. The prime minister found it hard to conceal a certain 
irritation at his news conference, preferring to stress the 
"excellent" relations and the "convergence of views" between 
these "two friendly countries." Admittedly, his office had been 
careful to adopt a low profile before his departure for Riyadh 
and not to make any reference to a framework accord, speaking 
instead of a new "reorientation" of bilateral relations. But 
during the flight to Saudi Arabia, Gerard Longuet [foreign trade 
minister], Francois Leotard [defense minister], and Alain Juppe 
[foreign affairs minister] displayed what proved to be excessive 
optimism less than 24 hours later. 
  Apart from the important diplomatic aspect of the visit, the 
only commercial benefit to come out of the prime minister's trip 
will have been the confirmation "in principle" by the Saudis to 
uphold the three maintenance contracts as planned: the ROH 
[expansion unknown] program for frigates purchased in 1980, a 
contract concerning pyrotechnics, and a contract relating to the 
Shahine self-propelled missile sold by Thomson in 1984. "An 
agreement in principle," stressed the prime minister's office, 
worth approximately 9 billion French francs [Fr]. It now 
remains to finalize the details. The Matignon [prime minister's 
office] pointed out that the timetable of work and financial 
terms of the contract remained to be settled. A joint committee 
of experts will be charged with this task. 
  By contrast, no precise agreements have been reached 
regarding the Sawari-2 program (purchase of three new 
antiaircraft frigates, for some Fr20 billion). Nothing either 
about the Airbus which Paris wants to sell to Riyadh to renew -- 
at least in part -- its civil air fleet. "The Airbus is on the 
list of matters of common interest," was the prime minister's 
sober comment. Nothing yet either on the other potential major 
civil contracts, such as the RAMS mobile telephony project 
(Thomson-CSF), or the installation of 1 million telephone lines 
which Alcatel is hoping for. As to the petroleum deal, it 
appears that these are the negotiations which are proceeding the 
most slowly. Nevertheless, Paris sees the confirmation of this 
week's visit to France by Muhammad Bin-Fahd -- the king's son 
and governor of the Western province with its rich oil resources 
-- as a positive sign. But how are we to explain what appears 
to be a semifailure on the part of French trade diplomacy? 
Gerard Longuet believes that "the Saudis do not want to go any 
further" for the time being to concentrate on intergovernmental 
relations, while the Matignon points out that a factor which 
could explain this "slowdown" could quite simply be the economic 
problems which Saudi Arabia is now also facing. It is true that 
it announced last week a 20-percent cut in expenditure for 1994. 
Also, on the eve of Edouard Balladur's arrival in Riyadh, it 
asked three of its U.S. arms suppliers to extend payment terms.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Saudi Arabia's Eastern 
Province governor Prince Muhammad Bin-Fahd arrived here on 
Monday [10 January] for a three-day official visit and meetings 
with French President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur scheduled for Wednesday [as received]. 
  The governor, a son of King Fahd, was to hold talks Tuesday 
with Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, Defence 
Minister Francois Leotard and Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. 
  Prince Mohammad, sometimes described as the king's 
"businessman" although he has no government portfolio, was also 
scheduled to dine with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and 
meet with French business leader Francois-Xavier Ortoli. 
  The governor's visit, arranged some time ago at the 
invitation of both Mitterrand and Balladur, follows the latter's 
weekend visit to Riyadh during which France hoped to clinch 
major arms deals. 
  Instead, Balladur's visit ended only with the establishment 
of a committee of experts charged with Franco-Saudi economic 
dossiers. 
  Saudi Arabia is currently faced with financial problems 
resulting from falling oil prices and a debt backlog from the 
Gulf war three years ago. 
  The governor, whose province produces most of Saudi Arabia's 
oil, was likely to continue discussions with French leaders 
raised by Balladur at the weekend, French Foreign Ministry 
sources said.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 11 (AFP) -- A French Foreign Ministry 
official Tuesday [11 Janaury] denied a decision had been taken 
on a visit by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to China later 
this month. 
  Reliable sources in Beijing had earlier said Balladur, 
accompanied by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Industry 
Minister Gerard Longuet would visit China from January 27 to 30 
to mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between the two countries. 
  Catherine Colonna, deputy spokesperson at the Foreign 
Ministry, said: "No decision has yet been taken on an eventual 
visit." 
  The sources in Beijing said a close Balladur aide, Jacques 
Friedman, visited China at the end of December to prepare for 
the visit which would come a year after a cooling in relations 
brought about by French sales of fighter aircraft to Taiwan. 
  Speaking on January 4, Juppe had said Paris this year hoped 
to rekindle relations with China.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Army of 240,000 -- Creation of </F>
Supplementary Division Possible, Says Mr. Leotard"] 
  [Text] Speaking before the Army's Military Council, Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard did not rule out the possibility that 
the new "size" of the Army would remain at around 240,000 
soldiers instead of the 225,000 provided for in the 
reorganization plan of Pierre Joxe, his predecessor at the 
Defense Ministry. In this way, the French Field Forces, 
comprising the Mechanized Armored Corps (CBM) and the Rapid 
Response Corps (FAR), would eventually have an extra division. 
  After stressing that, in his view, "an Army of 225,000 
troops 
would be an absolute minimum," Mr. Leotard stated that, as 
things stood, there were two possible solutions for Army troop 
numbers by 1997. From 1990 to 1993, numbers had fallen from 
288,500 to 241,400 (enlisted soldiers and conscripts), a drop of 
some 16.4 percent. The so-called Joxe plan, which has still not 
been officially repealed, provided for this figure to fall to 
225,000 by 1997. 
  Mr. Leotard explained to members of the military council 
that 
the options would be proposed by the government in due course in 
the framework of the new military planing law for 1995-2000, 
which will be put before Parliament in the spring of 1994. 
  The defense minister said: "One initial solution consists in 
reducing Army troop numbers to 225,000 or 230,000, divided over 
eight specific divisions providing the required range of 
abilities. This would just be sufficient to prevent and manage 
current short-term crises. The other solution in adapting the 
Army would be to adopt the size and structures existing in 1994, 
i.e., 240,000 soldiers in nine divisions." Mr. Leotard went on 
to state: "The conclusions drawn from the work done in the 
framework of the Defense white paper and the future military 
planning law will lead to a final decision being made on this 
issue." 
  This is the first time the defense minister has mentioned 
the 
possibility that the Joxe plan, which originally catered for the 
constitution of eight divisions, might no longer be acceptable. 
He thus echoed the claims made by the Army, whose General Staff 
had carried out studies -- which until now had remained 
relatively discreet -- in favor of the creation of a new 
division for the French field forces.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 10 (AFP) -- There is no alternative for 
France to its current economic policy for containing social 
costs and unemployment, Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said on 
Monday [10 January]. 
  He urged members of the centre-right parties behind the 
coalition government to support the policy. Reforms would be 
introduced at a speed compatible with the main concern of 
maintaining social harmony. 
  Expressing the conviction that "as things stand, no other 
policy is possible," he said: "The two absolute priorities of 
the government in 1994 are the balancing of the health insurance 
budget and control of the increase in unemployment by all the 
means available to us." 
  Sarkozy, who is spokesman for the government, was giving a 
New Year message to the press. 
  During January the government would announce "important 
decisions" concerning health insurance. 
  He noted that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur wanted the 
government to work hard for recovery without paying undue 
attention to the timetable for a presidential election next year.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The French Government's 
programme for privatisation will remove 668,000 employees and 
1,760 companies from the public productive sector if it is 
carried out fully, the INSEE official statistical institute 
reported on Tuesday [11 January]. 
  In a study based on the sector of French state companies, 
the 
biggest in the European Community, at the end of 1992, it also 
said that state companies had abolished 30,000 jobs in 1992. 
  The centre-right government which took power under Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur from socialists at the end of March, 
has announced a programme to privatise most of the main French 
industrial and financial companies in public ownership. The 
process is well under way. 
  Before the plan was announced, state enterprises employed 
1.7 
million people in 2,750 companies. At the end of 1992 employees 
in state companies accounted for 11.5 percent of the 
non-agricultural public sector working at market prices. 
  If all 21 main holding companies listed are privatised, one 
third of employees in the public sector and two thirds of the 
companies, will be removed from state control. 
  The number of people employed by the public sector would 
fall 
from 11.5 percent to seven percent of the sector working on the 
basis of market prices excluding agricultural activities. 
  If employees working for foreign subidiaries of state-owned 
groups are included, privatisation would remove one million 
people from the state's payroll. 
  After privatisation, the public sector would comprise mainly 
big public undertakings and some companies in the weapons 
industry. Of the total number of employees remaining, 75 
percent would work for the EDF and GDF electricity and gas 
companies, the coal sector, the SNCF railay network, the RATP 
transportation service in Paris, and the postal and 
telecommunications services. 
  The number of foreign subsidiaries operated by the publis 
sector would fall from 1,000 now to 150. 
  The change would have the biggest effect in the industrial 
sector, INSEE said, mentioning particularly the steel, oil, 
chemical, car, aero and electronic industries. Overall, nine 
percent of industrial jobs would be transferred to the private 
sector. 
  In the financial sector, the number of people employed by 
state- controlled companies would fall from nearly 33 percent to 
five percent, most of whom would work for the Bank of France. 
The insurance sector would become wholly-owned by private 
interests. 
  INSEE said that France stood to raise more by far than any 
other European country from privatisation. It did not provide 
figures but many estimates have put the income from the sale of 
the 21 companies at 400 billion francs (69 billion dollars). 
  INSEE said that most of the 43,000 jobs removed from the 
public sector in 1992 were shed by the Air France airline, the 
postal service, the Renault car company and the Bull computer 
manufacturer which together shed 30,000 people. 
  A further 26,000 jobs left the public sector, although not 
all of these were abolished since some were transferred to the 
private sector, and the public sector acquired 13,000 people 
through takeovers. 
  The net reduction of 43,000 people was as much as in the 
whole of the period from 1988 to 1991. 
  French Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy said on Monday that 
France had no alternative to its current economic policy if it 
were to contain the cost of social policies and combat 
unemployment, observers noted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta </F>
by Bernardo Valli in Rome; date not given: "`Europe Will 
Respond to the East's Fears'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- 
[introductory passage omitted] The election results in Russia 
took almost everyone by surprise, and now Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's 20 million votes loom like a threat over the 
Atlantic Council session in Brussels. Andreatta gave this 
analysis of the Russian election results: "Inertia, 
indifference, the fact that so many Russians failed to take part 
in the first democratic elections in their history could prompt 
a comparison with Weimar (pre-Nazi Germany -- LA REPUBBLICA 
editor's note). Questions also arise concerning the national 
character, the legacy of communism, apathy, nostalgia for 
equality within poverty. Zhirinovskiy's violence and the 
mourning for the loss of empire, the anti-Semitism, and the 
spirit of self-pity and revenge are reminiscent of men who hide 
in cellars, a reminder of Russia's constant oscillation between 
humiliation and a sense of mission -- the Third Rome, the New 
Constantinople. All this creates a sense of danger, the 
impression of the possible collapse of the institutions, of the 
political mechanism." 
  [Valli] In other words, something in a precarious state of 
balance, from which we must protect ourselves but that at the 
same time must not be angered, offended, provoked, to avoid 
causing or hastening a possible disaster? 
  [Andreatta] On the one hand, there is our objective anxiety 
about Russia, and, on the other, the realization that the way in 
which the West manages its security policy could prompt 
reactions in Russia, could determine events at an unsteady time 
when the country has an identity problem. [Andreatta ends] 
  Hence the existence of two schools of thought. One, strict 
and unyielding, that would extend NATO to the countries of 
Central Europe or even the Baltics, that have become emancipated 
since the collapse of the Soviet empire, both to protect them 
and to "contain" possible future Russian impulses. The other is 
concerned with not prompting the old sense of insecurity that 
has often been behind these expansionist impulses on Russia's 
part. 
  [Andreatta continues] Henry Kissinger represents the former 
school of thought, ruthlessly, albeit lucidly, as always. He 
says that to leave a security vacuum on Russia's borders means 
causing history to repeat itself. The other school of thought 
would help Russia's reformist leaders in the security field, as 
has been done in the economic field, with a view to facilitating 
democratic development. 
  [Valli] But the prevailing line is the middle path proposed 
by the Americans under the name Partnership for Peace. 
  [Andreatta] Yes -- with all the ambiguities concealed 
beneath 
the concept of flexibility that lies at the root of the project. 
It provides no proper guarantees. Indeed, the first school of 
thought says that they are weak guarantees, similar to those 
that characterized relations between the Western countries and 
those of Central and East Europe in the 1930's. The difficulty 
is how to deal with two problems using the same instrument. On 
the one hand, it is necessary to reassure Russia and on the 
other it is necessary to protect the neighboring countries that 
feel threatened. In both instances anxiety about security could 
block the democratic process, which -- except in 
Czechoslovakia's case -- is new everywhere and has no foundation 
in the past. 
  [Valli] Do you have a solution? 
  [Andreatta] It seems to me that there is a division of 
tasks. 
The United States and NATO have the task of creating security 
conditions, and therefore also of reassuring the Russian 
federation. The other task perhaps lies with the European Union, 
and it is to strengthen bonds, ties, connections, relations with 
the countries of Central and East Europe so that it is clear to 
even the most impetuous of Russians that beyond their country's 
historical confines lie European territories. 
  [Valli] Are you referring to the recent Italian-British 
initiative? 
  [Andreatta] Yes, and it proposes that the European Union 
extend the second and third pillars of the Maastricht Treaty -- 
which concern foreign and security policy and internal and 
judicial policy -- to the countries of Central and East Europe. 
  [Valli] Basically, a gradual association with the European 
Union with regard to the various fields of policy -- leaving 
aside the Economic Community, with which it is definitely too 
early to proceed. 
  [Andreatta] The rationale is to have several instruments for 
resolving a number of problems. 
  [Valli] So you regard the security architecture proposed by 
the Americans under the name of Partnership for Peace as fragile 
or incomplete. 
  [Andreatta] We will say in Brussels that any wrong moves or 
intimidations on Russia's part would call the philosophy of that 
plan into question. Indeed, it is a plan that envisages an 
orderly evolution of life in Russia. Clearly, if imperialist 
options were to emerge again, this project -- being flexible by 
nature, and not a treaty of alliance -- would undergo some 
profound changes. [Andreatta ends] 
  The partnership -- in which Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and 
the Czech Republic should participate -- does not envisage 
NATO's automatic intervention in the event of an outside threat, 
as is the case with the 16 members of the Atlantic alliance, but 
it does envisage the possibility of asking the NATO Council to 
examine the consequences of the crisis or conflict and perhaps 
to secure help. It also envisages the possibility of 
participating in peacekeeping military operations, without 
integrated commands. This is rather like an apprenticeship with 
a view to future membership. 
  [Valli] So the plan entails a certain dynamic and leaves 
matters unresolved. This is why you talk about flexibility and 
ambiguity. Is it a transitional plan? Until the situation in 
Moscow becomes clearer? 
  [Andreatta] NATO must not lose its role with respect to its 
16 member countries; it must not dilute its task of guaranteeing 
their security. However, if a normal reform were to become 
firmly established in Russia; if, of the two tendencies in 
Russian history, the European one were to prevail; then the 
possibility of its joining NATO could be reappraised, and NATO 
itself would have to be reappraised. This cannot be ruled out. 
For that matter, the Partnership for Peace does not rule out a 
gradual accession. 
  [Valli] For the present the prospect of Russia's accession 
to 
the alliance is regarded as the entry of the wolf into the 
European sheepfold -- especially in view of the emergence of the 
Zhirinovskiy phenomenon. 
  [Andreatta] That seems to me an image suited to the 
rationale 
that Kissinger represents. [Andreatta ends] 
  Another important topic at the Brussels summit is the now 
recognized possibility for the Europeans to use NATO's technical 
infrastructures for strictly European operations under European 
command. That is, operations without American participation. 
  [Valli] At one time the Bush administration opposed it, 
because it feared that the United States would lose authority 
over the Old Continent. And some Europeans, and especially the 
French, did not consider it a positive prospect, because they 
thought that it would delay the establishment of a European 
army. What has changed in the meantime? 
  [Andreatta] Some of the tensions between Europe and the 
United States have been alleviated. While the dispute between 
the French and Americans over GATT (the updating of which led to 
a confrontation between Paris and Washington over agricultural 
products and cultural products including television programs -- 
LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) was in progress, Edouard Balladur's 
government in Paris was resolving other problems with the United 
States. 
  [Valli] Minor trade conflicts often arise within NATO, 
sometimes harming relations between the two sides of the 
Atlantic. Could they in time constitute a threat to the alliance? 
  [Andreatta] It is important that the use of unilateral 
decisions be abolished in trade policies when minor conflicts of 
interest arise between the two sides of the Atlantic -- minor 
compared to those between America and Japan. We must prevent the 
newspapers from being full of headlines about steel and tomato 
wars. Those were minor events as long as the imperatives of 
security were predominant, but the relaxation of tension brought 
about by the end of the Cold War could make them much more 
troublesome and damaging, partly because they cause a stiffening 
on the part of public opinion. [Andreatta ends] 
  Minister Andreatta's early references to George Kennan are 
significant. He no longer cites that name, and neither did I, 
but as our conversation approached its conclusion it drifted 
toward the Mediterranean (to which Andreatta would like to 
extend the partnership for peace) and I was reminded of Kennan. 
I tried to remember what he wrote in the winter of 1946 when, 
rather isolated in the victorious and suspicious Moscow, he 
pondered what stance to adopt toward that former ally, now an 
adversary. By proposing to President Truman a strategy of 
containment, Kennan perhaps believed that Russia's 
"irresistible" expansionist impulses were due more to defensive 
reasons, to the fear of isolation, rather than to an impetus to 
rule the world. Be that as it may, he had to ponder this 
dilemma and concluded that the right thing to do was both to 
prevent and at the same time to reassure. There ensued the 
inevitable Cold War, won by NATO without recourse to guns. In 
very different terms, it is true, and within a very different 
international context, Russia now poses a less dramatic, but not 
so dissimilar, dilemma. One school of thought says that we must 
wait so as not to cause a provocation, while the other argues 
that if in the future East Europe absolutely must join NATO to 
protect itself from a situation that has grown worse in Moscow, 
it would certainly be more dangerous to do it then than now. 
That is what Kissinger says. Perhaps he is not mistaken.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vincenzo Parisi, commander in chief of </F>
Italian Police Force, by Giovanni Ruggiero in Rome; date not 
given: "`An Attack Launched by Subtle Minds' -- Parisi 
Denounces Maneuvers and Denies Charges: I Never Took Money From 
Secret Services"] 
  [Text] "There are subtle minds at work that want to 
halt the great transformations that are taking place": Such is 
the chief of police's reply to the charges that have led to his 
name being entered in the list of those under investigation. 
"It is an attempt to interfere in the life of the country," he 
explains to AVVENIRE, "and foment distrust in all sectors of 
society." 
  He has run the gauntlet of criticisms and accusations 
in the past, remaining steadfast and impassive throughout. 
However, this seems to be Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi's 
darkest hour. No other issue had ever induced him to hand the 
minister his resignation. The list of those under investigation 
refers to allegations against him of embezzlement and abetting 
crime. Parisi answered our questions cordially. He is 
indignant, but he regards himself as extraneous to the 
intrigue. 
  [Ruggiero] Commander Parisi, you knew nothing about all 
this? 
  [Parisi] Nothing at all. I found out toward midnight on 7 
January. I had received no notification before then, nothing 
whatsoever. 
  [Ruggiero] You denounce maneuvers against you designed, more 
generally, to destabilize the country. Do you lump everything 
that is happening together? 
  [Parisi] I do not include the person who compiled the entry 
in the list of investigations, which is a mandatory procedure, 
as the Rome public prosecutor has explained: It is a necessary 
procedure because entry in the list cannot be avoided, whatever 
sort of allegations are made, even when they are obviously 
unfounded. Of course, whoever broke the rule of silence, 
leaking the news late in the day, has not exactly behaved 
impeccably. 
  [Ruggiero] What we meant by maneuver, however, is everything 
that preceded your entry in the list. 
  [Parisi] Of course, but, rather than a maneuver this could 
be 
merely the sign of a fairly common strategy of defense: 
launching an attack instead of rallying to the defense, attack 
as the best form of defense. 
  [Ruggiero] On whose part? 
  [Parisi] The people under investigation, those who attack 
others violently to bring those others into the limelight rather 
than themselves. It is an old trick, and we shall have to see 
what practical advantage it gives them. Those who do it are 
fishing in troubled waters. 
  [Ruggiero] The allegations are embezzlement and abetting 
crime. 
  [Parisi] There has been no embezzlement of 3 million lire 
because I never took that money. As far as the abetting 
allegation is concerned, it is utter rubbish. However, I am at 
the examining magistrates' complete disposal to clear up this 
second issue; the first has already been dealt with. 
  [Ruggiero] The atmosphere is becoming uglier and uglier. Is 
there a coup in the air? 
  [Parisi] It is not a matter of coups but of an attempt to 
interfere in the life of the republic by creating a murky 
climate, rendering it more and more malevolent, and, above all, 
sowing the seeds of discontent and increasingly widespread 
distrust in all sectors of society. 
  [Ruggiero] Who might have a vested interest in all this? 
  [Parisi] A lot of people. All those who want to halt the 
course of history. 
  [Ruggiero] Political forces? 
  [Parisi] I do not want to identify them. I cannot define 
them, even in terms of class allegiance, because I do not have 
sufficient information. However, there are interest groups that 
would like to halt the course of democracy. They are forces 
with links to the criminal world as well, and who are therefore 
going all out to hinder the process of renewal. 
  [Ruggiero] There is no connection between real bombs and 
"bombshells" in the figurative sense? 
  [Parisi] It is difficult to say. Of course, all that has 
happened in absolutely correct, orthodox terms to clean things 
up has been submerged by a certain type of campaign, and above 
all by the misinformation that has been brought in to inflate 
everything. It is still happening. These developments are 
highly insidious and hint at subtle minds moving within a 
well-reasoned and calculated timeframe with the intention of 
destabilizing the situation. 
  [Ruggiero] This would seem to be your darkest hour. 
  [Parisi] I think that it is the most difficult hour in the 
history of Italy. My person is of only modest significance in 
comparison with the general interest. 
  [Ruggiero] All the same, this time you submitted your 
resignation. 
  [Parisi] It was my duty. 
  [Ruggiero] But you did not do so on a number of other 
occasions when you came under violent attack, in the Contrada 
affair, for example. 
  [Parisi] Allow me to say that in that case my role was 
entirely institutional, not private, and that the whole matter 
was passed on to the magistrates, so it was up to them to draw 
their conclusions. 
  [Ruggiero] But have you never entertained suspicions 
regarding the great festering sore in the secret services? 
  [Parisi] I have no monitoring powers. I left the secret 
services seven years ago, and five different directors have 
succeeded one another since then; what should I know about what 
has been and is happening there? The head of the secret 
services does not report to the chief of police: He is entirely 
his own master.

<F P=106> [Article by Barbara Palombelli: "Attacks and Venom -- </F>
Ciampi: `Perhaps Alarm a Little Exaggerated'"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels -- "Not at all. I never met with DIA 
[Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate] Director Gianni De 
Gennaro. I know that he passed through the Palazzo Chigi 
[government seat] last Friday [7 January], but certainly not to 
meet with me or for a security summit." Prime Minister Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi, flying from Rome to Brussels, denied the report 
in the Naples daily newspaper IL MATTINO that a top secret 
meeting had taken place two days ago between the head of 
government and the anti-Mafia leader with the aim of discussing 
the mysterious threats against President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 
Moreover, these threats were supposed to have come from 
opponents in possession of no less than "an arsenal of infrared 
missiles capable of penetrating the dark of night and striking 
any target with great precision." However, this was not the 
only denial to be heard during the prime minister's flight. 
Sitting beside Ciampi, his military adviser, General 
Giannattasio, reread the IL MATTINO article and explained: 
"Weapons like these only exist in films. Perhaps not even in 
films." 
  Giannattasio was quite clear that this is pure fantasy. A 
little earlier in Rome, Police Chief Vincenzo Parisi made his 
position clear: "These are exaggerations that are completely 
unfounded but which could lead us to ridicule dangers and alarms 
that are serious." On the flight to the NATO summit in 
Brussels, the impression was that the head of government felt 
himself to be stronger than the venom and conspiracies, and that 
perhaps he hardly believes them at all. He confided in his men 
that he believed the alarm spreading through the country to be 
"perhaps a little exaggerated." In his blue cardigan and 
glasses the prime minister chatted at length with [Foreign 
Minister Beniamino] Andreatta, then started to work on his 
folders at his table, just as if he were in his office and 
despite the strong turbulence that accompanied the two-hour 
flight. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bossi Attenuates Federalism; DC </F>
Centrists Regain Impetus: `Mino, Ally With League and 
Berlusconi'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Umberto Bossi has made it known that for the 
time being he is setting aside his federalist dreams for the 
sake of the battle against Achille Occhetto, and has fanned the 
flames of the current conflict among Christian Democrats. The 
neocentrists immediately seized this opportunity to argue again 
the "need" for a grand alliance comprising the nonconfessional 
groups, the DC [Christian Democratic Party], the League, and 
Silvio Berlusconi. 
  To underline the significance of their demand, all the 
group's leaders have entered the arena -- Pierferdinando Casini, 
Francesco D'Onofrio, Clemente Mastella, Franco Fausti, Sandro 
Fontana, Ombretta Fumagalli-Carulli, and Silvio Lega signed a 
joint statement yesterday. In it they told Martinazzoli that 
"Christian Democrats must be clearly aware of the nature of a 
conflict that cannot be resolved by means of appeals -- though 
we consider them praiseworthy and sincere -- but only on the 
basis of a real and proper political clarification." 
  This "political clarification" concerns the policy of 
alliances of the DC and of the future People's Party. Hitherto 
Martinazzoli has always said that the League and Berlusconi are 
not possible allies and that Mario Segni remains the only 
reference point. 
  Now the "neocentrists" are reading with satisfaction the 
interview with Umberto Bossi published by IL GIORNALE yesterday 
in which the League leader says: "We have realized that our 
interlocutors are not yet ready for federalism, so we are 
scaling down our demands." Translated, this means that the 
League is afraid of the progressive alignment and will content 
itself with regionalism as long as Occhetto can be defeated. 
  This remark prompted the "neocentrists" to say: "The League 
leader must begin a revision on the topics of national unity, 
democracy, and an end to North-South discrimination. These are 
some of the demands made by Christian Democratic `neocentrists' 
and by those, such as Buttiglione, who have no prejudices 
against sitting down at a common table to draw up a moderate, 
liberal-democratic cartel." 
  The next step was a logical one -- another ultimatum to 
Martinazzoli. The neocentrists wrote: "This, and no other, is 
the only path capable of preventing Occhetto's victory. 
Martinazzoli must make it clear whether -- as Rosy Bindi, 
Mattarella, and Elia say -- there is on the part of the People's 
Party a predetermined rejection of an accord with the 
nonconfessional groups, Berlusconi, and the League." 
  Rosy Bindi responded to this from Padua, urging DC 
Chairwoman 
Rosa Russo Jervolino to "take the legal steps to dissolve the 
party" so that on 18 January the National Council can officially 
announce the birth of the People's Party. 
  Venice's "pasionaria" went on to demand once more that the 
People's Party include as few representatives as possible of the 
"buried party." Therefore, she said, it is better that all 
outgoing members of parliament stand aside and forego standing 
as candidates in the coming elections. This appeal, addressed 
for the present to deputies and senators of the Venice region, 
was made official yesterday at the meeting held in Padua to 
appoint the coordinators for the People's Party in the Venice 
region. 
  These 111 "musketeers" will choose the candidates for the 
coming elections, in very close cooperation with Bindi. 
Defining how they will be chosen, "la pasionaria" said: "We 
will consider outgoing members whom it is important that we 
field as candidates again and who can provide evidence of lofty 
ethical standards, but everyone must first be willing to stand 
aside." 
  So Rosy Bindi is issuing a new challenge. Just a year and a 
half ago, when she assumed the leadership of the Venice DC, 
which had been brought to its knees by the judicial inquiries, 
she asked all investigatees to stop attending party meetings; 
now she is directly addressing all those elected in the 5 April 
1992 elections to agree to submit to an "examination" by her 111 
trusted coordinators appointed yesterday. In theory, 
irrespective of the election results, 25 parliamentarians risk 
losing their seats, including two former ministers -- Carlo 
Fracanzani and Carlo Bernini -- and the current deputy secretary 
at the Treasury Ministry, Giovanni Malvestio.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Indro's Long Farewell: `I've </F>
Finished Here Now'"] 
  [Excerpt] Milan -- The split between Indro Montanelli and 
Silvio Berlusconi is now complete. Montanelli has decided to 
leave IL GIORNALE, which he founded 20 years ago, to try his 
fortune with LA VOCE -- a glorious title created in 1903 by 
Giovanni Prezzolini, another "anarcho-conservative" like 
himself. "The rift between Berlusconi and me remains 
irremediable," Montanelli told the editorial board. He added: 
"Berlusconi has neither the courage nor the strength to dismiss 
me, so I will decide when to leave." The immediate response 
from Fininvest's president was: "I rule out the possibility 
that the Montanelli that I know could have made any such 
remarks." 
<H5>  Soothing Remarks </H5>
  Be that as it may, the team for the new paper -- which will 
probably be based in via Manzoni, in the very center of Milan -- 
is ready, or almost. The art director will be Vittorio Corona, 
another escapee from the Fininvest group, former domestic news 
desk chief on Italia 1 and before that editor of KING, the 
lively monthly owned by RAI [Italian State Radio and Television] 
publications. Head of publicity will be Luigi Guastamacchia, 
long head of the SPI [Italian Advertising Association] agency 
(though negotiations are also under way with Publikompass). In 
any case, its official presentation is now imminent: It will 
take place 14 January at Rome's Ambasciatori Hotel. 
  Yesterday was a long day for Montanelli. His rapid luncheon 
(at which the main course was tagliatelle) with Silvio 
Berlusconi at the latter's Milan apartment on via Rovani, cannot 
have been the best part of it. This is confirmed by the fact 
that the meeting did not take place at Berlusconi's mansion 
house at Arcore. Montanelli's dislike of courts and courtiers 
is well known. Berlusconi's strained expression after the 
meeting was more eloquent than his soothing remarks. 
  "Of course Montanelli is not leaving," he told journalists. 
"I think we could say that there has been a lot of fuss about 
nothing." But the prince of journalists himself made no 
statements. Inevitably. Despite Berlusconi's forced optimism, 
the meeting was apparently rather stormy. This, partly because 
Montanelli is someone who loves making vitriolic remarks. 
  According to certain disclosures, Berlusconi apparently 
began 
by asking Montanelli to stay on as editor of IL GIORNALE until 
the elections. This, as a sacrifice for the sake of the 
conservative alignment on whose behalf Berlusconi is working. 
Montanelli apparently did not reply directly. But he did 
criticize him harshly for having attended IL GIORNALE's 
editorial board meeting a couple of days ago. This move was 
regarded as an attack on his prerogatives as editor. But above 
all it was a gaffe that follows the criticisms leveled by editor 
of Television Channel 4 news, Emilio Fede, speaking on the 
Fininvest network. 
  The remarks, as reported by Montanelli to IL GIORNALE's 
editorial board yesterday afternoon, sound like a slap in the 
face to Berlusconi: "It was wrong of you to come to the meeting 
here yesterday," Montanelli told Berlusconi. "This, first 
because you gave to understand that the Mammi law can be 
circumvented; and, second, because you split the editorial board 
by making it understood that whoever sides with you will have 
money, while those who side with me with have their 
independence." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Stefano Zurlo: "Rocco And His Baggage"] </F>
  [Text] Who is this Buttiglione who aspires to be 
leader of the Christian Democrats [DC]? He has dinner with the 
pope; takes notes in German; writes books in Polish; and likes 
Father Giussani and Julia Roberts. The following is an 
unauthorized biography of the philosopher who wants to lead the 
DC. 
  With his natural immodesty, he has defined himself as "the 
number one assistant of Professor Wojtyla." In other words, the 
most authentic exponent and interpreter of the philosophical 
ideas of John Paul II. 
  All the other labels are too narrow for Rocco Buttiglione. 
It 
is probably true, however, that he is a philosopher, a political 
scientist, the former ideologist of the Communion and Liberation 
[CL] movement, the favorite disciple of Augusto Del Noce, and 
the intellectual who is adapted to politics, and perhaps many 
other things, too--but all this is as nothing compared to the 
friendship and esteem of the pope, who in fact appears to have 
accorded high praise to Buttiglione's book Il pensiero 
filosofico di Karol Wojtyla [The Philosophical Ideas of Karol 
Wojtyla]. The pope has accordingly transfigured Buttiglione 
into a kind of intellectual super partes who stands 
aloof from the worldly matters in which, however, he is actually 
immersed 18 hours a day. 
  It is a continuing contradiction for Buttiglione who moves 
with the ease and frustrated ingenuousness of a man of culture 
in the environment of dramatic practicality that characterizes 
DC headquarters on the Piazza del Gesu [headquarters of the 
Christian Democratic Party] in Rome where Buttiglione has been 
installed as chairman of the Ethics Committee for the reform of 
the party. Now, however, he is a candidate for party secretary 
of the post-Martinazzoli period. But that is the way it is: in 
Italy, today, it is the turn of the professors. They have the 
task of rebuilding everything that the others have devastated as 
barbarians. It is the day of the Ciampis, of the Cacciaris, of 
the Demattes. These are all people who prefer the bicycle to the 
off-road vehicle. They are intellectuals who do not pale at the 
name of a poet or philosopher. Who is not daunted by the 
Germanophile encyclopedism of Franco Tato, the new managing 
director of Fininvest?, or when reading the mile-long resume of 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi? Whether these gentlemen now know how to be 
administrators is another question. 
  Buttiglione fits perfectly into this pantheon. Although born 
in Gallipoli, Apulia, he represents the most severe challenge to 
the old southern DC. Remember Ciriaco De Mita and the court of 
miracles of Nusco, that irresolute Italian who seemed 
perpetually to be down with a cold? And who has forgotten the 
histrionic speech mannerisms of Paolo Cirino Pomicino, or the 
variegated crowd of lovers and bagmen that surrounded him, or 
Claila, the boat of the provincial Onassis that was berthed in 
the Naples sun? Buttiglione is light years distant from that 
stereotype. 
  A few details will help us to understand. In addition to 
English and French, the professor speaks German and Polish. He 
is the author of an impressive number of books, articles, and 
essays. Then there is the oleography [as published]: he takes 
notes in German (which for him is like a mother tongue). He also 
gives orders in German to Teo, his huge German shepherd (the 
name is engraved on the dog's collar), which he personally takes 
out for walks and treats him as his toy. 
<H5>  The Meeting With Wojtyla </H5>
  The thickest part of his biography, however, is the one that 
involves the Polish language. Buttiglione learned Polish by 
reading the pope's books in the original version and by 
fraternizing with the Catholic intellectuals of Krakow. 
  A priest from Romagna who was associated with the Communion 
and Liberation movement, Don Francesco Ricci, introduced him 
during the 1970's into the ecclesiastic circles of Krakow. Don 
Ricci was director of the Center for Eastern European Studies 
and was in close contact with Polish anti-Communist circles. 
During that period, Buttiglione collaborated with a publishing 
house that was close to CL--Jaca Book--which had a series 
dedicated precisely to the countries of real socialism. Don 
Ricci one day brought the brilliant intellectual to Krakow and 
introduced him to the then-Bishop Karol Wojtyla. When Wojtyla 
became pope, he brought Don Stanislao Dsziwisz to Rome as his 
private secretary, and Don Stanislao summoned Buttiglione to the 
Vatican on instructions from John Paul II. This began a 
relationship that has never been interrupted. Rocco's interest 
in the Church, moreover, is shared by his family: his two 
sisters--Angela and Marina--are both Vaticanists, working 
respectively for TG-1 [TV Channel 1 news] and TG-5. There is 
even an antipope in the family: the mother-in-law, Caterina 
Jacobelli, a theologian of the dissidence. But Rocco is 
something more than that--indeed, much more than that--on the 
other side of the Tiber. Recently, too, when the the encyclicals 
Veritatis splendor and Centesimus annus 
were being written, Buttiglione was at the pope's side. In 
particular, the 45-year-old philosopher from Gallipoli wrote the 
most important chapter of Centesimus annus--the 
chapter that deals with the changes in East Europe, the end of 
real socialism, and the advent of a new era. 
  Very well, but what is the nature of this new era? Here is 
where Buttiglione emerges from limbo and the chorus of angels 
and plays his ace--the Church's social doctrine--which is a 
manual for the kind of civil coexistence that has been dear to 
the pope's heart ever since the 1980's and that has been 
forgotten by Catholics who have devoted themselves to politics, 
notably the Christian Democrats. Indeed, the social doctrine was 
disregarded to such an extent that the content was lost. Many 
Catholics pay the doctrine lip service, and some quote it 
(usually inopportunely) in speeches at the party congresses, 
explaining that it is the visionary third way--the evangelical 
alternative to savage capitalism and ferocious Marxism. 
<H5>  God, Municipality, and Family </H5>
  Buttiglione, on the other hand, knows by memory the basic 
concepts of the doctrine, and accordingly promises miracles. The 
key passage calls for the application of the principle of 
subsidiariness, whereby each level of the social pyramid should 
be self-sufficient and should request help from the next higher 
level only in case of necessity. 
  But the levels of the social pyramid that have been designed 
by the pope's philosopher also seem strange. First of all, there 
is the family, and then by successive levels one finally reaches 
God. In synthesis, it is a triad of values: God, municipality, 
and family. In fact, Buttiglione counters the federalism of 
Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Miglio--and its many 
microregions--with the concept of a nation of regions, parishes, 
and villages [campanili], as taught by Catholic tradition, which 
is anti-Piedmont and localist. Is it a credible plan, or an 
indigestible mix [preceding word in English]? 
  Buttiglione constructed this table of values by adding up 
and 
blending various formative experiences which--as an intellectual 
enamored more of himself than of anything else--he subsequently 
surpassed and put aside. 
  The first of these formative experiences was his 
discovery--as a young man--of Communion and Liberation, through 
a priest from Catania, Don Ciccio Ventorino. Buttiglione was 
impressed by the importance that Don Luigi Giussani, CL's 
founder, placed on the evangelical phrase "whosoever follows me 
shall have a hundredfold here below and eternal life." The young 
Buttiglione was fascinated by the "hundred-fold" concept--by the 
challenge posed by this kind of Christianity that deals with 
everyday life and aspires to redeem it. Along the way, 
Buttiglione also made the acquaintance of Augusto Del Noce, one 
of the most recent active Catholic thinkers. Del Noce was the 
only Catholic thinker in this century to attempt a Catholic 
reinterpretation of history, following the example of the great 
reactionaries and enemies of the modernism of the 1980's, from 
Joseph De Maistre to Monaldo Leopardi. In Del Noce's opinion, 
the right-left classification must be replaced by the 
sacred-profane classification. 
  By completing CL's anthropology, Del Noce's example gave 
Buttiglione the ideological framework that he lacked, and 
Buttiglione expressed his gratitude whenever he could. Every so 
often the master would ask him to supply quotations from Hegel, 
to which the disciple responded immediately--from memory, and in 
German. 
  One thing is sure. Del Noce, Don Giussani, and Don Ricci 
were 
Buttiglione's three principal teachers, but over time things 
changed. Don Ricci and Del Noce died, and relations with Don 
Giussani soured. Meanwhile, however, relations were developed 
with other sponsors [preceding word in English]: the Vatican 
and--beginning in the mid-1980's--certain intellectuals in the 
United States. 
  The latter included Michael Novak and George 
Weigel--sociologists and theorists of Catholic capitalism--and 
subsequently a series of bishops and cardinals, including John 
O'Connor of New York and Joseph Bernardin of Chicago (who became 
famous worldwide because of the accusations of pedophilia). They 
are the right wing of the U.S Church. 
  The triad of God, fatherland, and family is once again with 
us. Buttiglione is at his ease on the other side of the ocean 
because--among other things--his foothold in the United Sgates 
gives him the dimension that he had lacked, namely 
internationalization: a gift that only a few of the saints had 
ubiquitousness. To those who point out that his appearances at 
Teramo--where he teaches political philosophy--have become less 
frequent, he responds in a truly baronial manner. "If I give 
lectures in New York and Rio de Janeiro, in Buenos Aires and 
Washington," he says, "it is because they invite me, and this 
does no harm to the university where I teach, but in fact 
enhances its prestige." It is the culture of the visiting 
professor [preceding two words in English]. 
<H5>  "It's A Pity He Is Naive" </H5>
  And as a visiting professor, Buttiglione will speak a few 
words of charitable common sense to anyone in the decomposing 
universe of Catholic power who asks him to do so. They all want 
him to speak; they all revere him as if he were an icon. For 
that reason they are running him as a candidate for the most 
unlikely posts: mayor of Rome (but he does not reside there); 
editor of the moribund Catholic weekly IL SABATO; and editor of 
the daily L'AVVENIRE. It is quite true that it costs nothing to 
promise that which no longer exists. This includes the ethics of 
the DC, which he is has been asked to reorganize, given the fact 
that for every meeting the party holds, the judiciary responds 
with an average of five arrests--a little too much to be allowed 
to continue. "He is naive," the Catholic writer and journalist 
Vittorio Messori told L'EUROPEO. "He is unable to recognize the 
bait put out by the media, and that is why his interviews and 
statements sometimes appear to be stupid. I hold him in high 
esteem, however." 
  Will the professor who does not know how to avoid the traps 
set by the journalists be able to avoid the entanglements of 
politics? Will he be the savior of a DC that is in the process 
of liquidation? "If they offer me the position of secretary, I 
shall accept it," Buttiglione answers, with the typical 
terseness of someone who is at the head of his class. "He will 
lose," Messori says. "When there is a revolution, it is fought 
between Girondists and Jacobins. No one remains in the center. 
But one day Thermidor [Robespierre's overthrow] will come, and 
Buttiglione will be revalued." 
  Be that as it may, Buttiglione does have one merit by 
comparison with Martinazzoli: he is good-humored and whimsical. 
A small example? Two years ago, he saw (in the original 
language, of course) the film Pretty Woman, featuring 
Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and he was profoundly impressed 
by it. He accordingly went to the store, bought the 
videocassette, and gave it to his three daughters, praising the 
film's "highly educational content for the younger generations." 
For those who have never seen it, Pretty Woman is the 
story of a prostitute who falls in love with one of her clients.

  [Text] The government is satisfied with the NATO summit's 
decision on expanding the Alliance. 
  Briefing correspondents today, government spokesman Ioannis 
Kasoulidhis said Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou very 
correctly noted that the decision to include former Warsaw Pact 
and CSCE countries in the plan for cooperation on peace gives 
Cyprus the right to cooperate with NATO if it wants. Asked 
whether the government intends to express such an interest, 
Kasoulidhis replied that Cyprus is happy to have the right, but 
added that it does not intend to use it now. 
  Kasoulidhis said Papandreou did not raise the Cyprus issue 
at 
the NATO summit because he was there representing the European 
Union, not the Greek Government. The spokesman added that 
Papandreou planned to raise the Cyprus ssue during a luncheon 
for the NATO leaders.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis described 
the reports by the UN experts on the confidence-building 
measures as an aid to the United Nations, and reiterated that 
they are unofficial documents that do not bind the Greek Cypriot 
side. Kasoulidhis said the measures must be implemented in a 
way that will not directly or indirectly recognize the 
pseudostate. He said some of the points in the report will be 
discussed if and when the Turkish side replies positively to the 
three UN documents. The spokesman said: It would be a great 
diplomatic mistake to say that the Greek Cypriot side will 
negotiate the methods suggested by the experts, who will be a 
point for negotiating themselves. 
  Kasoulidhis said President Glavkos Kliridhis does not intend 
to convene the National Council to discuss the substance of the 
confidence-building measures or the reports by the UN experts. 
He concluded: The National Council discussed the tactics and 
strategy.

  [Text] According to President Rauf Denktas, both sides must 
aspire for the same thing in order to reach a solution in 
Cyprus, but we have not reached such a point yet. 
  Denktas today received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's assistant envoy for Cyprus. John Paul Cavanaugh, UN 
peace force adviser, and Necati Munir Ertekun, presidential 
adviser, also attended the meeting, which is continuing through 
lunch as well. 
  Denktas remarked before the meeting that the sides must 
converge on a common point if a solution is to be reached in 
Cyprus. We have not yet reached such a point and it is still 
early for this, Denktas added. Reacting to recent Kliridhis 
statements, the president explained that Kliridhis is defending 
his own cause and this is natural. Denktas noted that the 
Turkish Cypriots, in turn, defend their own just cause in their 
own way and will continue to do so. 
  Asked if he is hopeful, Denktas said that in order for that 
to happen, the two sides must first meet at the negotiating 
table and bilateral talks must begin. In reply to another 
question, Denktas reported that the Cyprus problem may be 
discussed with Turkey at the beginning of February, and that an 
assessment will be conducted with the government and the 
Republican Assembly before that. 
  In his statement before the meeting, Feissel noted that Joe 
Clark's arrival was postponed in an effort to schedule a 
suitable time to meet with officials in Turkey, Greece, and 
Cyprus.

  [Excerpts] The Republican Assembly began to debate the 
program of the coalition government of the Democratic Party and 
the Republican Turkish Party. 
  First to address the Assembly was Dervis Eroglu, leader of 
the main opposition National Unity Party [NUP], who described 
the government program as a flippant and inconsistent list of 
promises without an overall philosophy. This is not a program 
that can serve the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] or 
the Turkish Cypriot people, he charged, or that can defend or 
advance the national cause in line with national interests. He 
added: This program is not unified. It is full of 
inconsistencies; it does not have political vision; it does not 
foresee to uphold or to promote the TRNC. It is bound to fail. 
It prefers propaganda to the implementation of policies. 
  The NUP leader alleged that the program will create problems 
in the country, will bring confusion, and will help to destroy 
the state mechanism. We will vote against this program, he 
said, which does not protect the national interests of the TRNC 
or of Turkey. 
  Eroglu went on to say that it is not yet clear what kind of 
a 
foreign policy the government will pursue. He alleged that the 
coalition wants to pursue a daily foreign policy that it will 
make up as it goes along. He noted out that the points made in 
the government program are completely contrary to the 
inalienable and basic principle on which the TRNC is founded. 
He charged that the program does not foresee keeping the TRNC 
alive. He said the program gives the green light to a unitary 
state. Referring to the 1977 and 1979 summit agreements, he 
said, the government program ignores the developments that have 
taken place up to now and thus denies the rights gained so far. 
The government is trying to make the press dependent on the 
state, he said, and we view with suspicion the promise that 
Bayrak Radio and Television will be granted autonomy. 
  The NUP leader pointed out that the promises made to civil 
servants during the election campaign are not to be seen in the 
government program. He charged that the government's economic 
program will only bring new problems. Instead of developing a 
free market economy, he said, the government is tying the 
economy to the state again. We are pessimistic about the future 
of the economy, he said. 
  Eroglu stated that while the coalition cooperation protocol 
had said the state revenues and expenditures would be indexed to 
foreign exchange rates, the government program takes a step back 
from this principle. He added that the election promise of 
reducing the duration of military service is also omitted in the 
government program. 
  Addressing the Assembly on behalf of the Communal Liberation 
Party [CLP], party leader Mustafa Akinci described the 
government program as abstract, unclear, and indecisive. He 
charged that the specific promises made during the election 
campaign were diluted in the government protocol and become 
completely unrecognizable in the government program. [passage 
omitted] 
  Akinci said: Even though the Cyprus problem is the most 
important problem, it seems that enough time was not allotted to 
that issue during the efforts to establish the government. 
  Akinci pointed out that the confidence-building measures are 
not mentioned in the program. On the other hand, he stressed, 
the Greek Cypriot administration started extensive work on this 
issue. 
  The CLP leader said the program has nothing on the issue of 
a 
federation or a confederation, and is inconsistent on the 
territorial issues. The government must determine its Cyprus 
policy before the vote of confidence, he added. 
  Akinci said the government program does not mention the 
issue 
of how to promote the TRNC in the world, or what the 
government's views are on the issue of European unity. [passage 
omitted] 
  The CLP leader concluded by saying that it is impossible for 
his party to vote in favor of this indecisive program.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros </F>
Pangalos by correspondent Anna Panayiotarea; place and date not 
given--ellipses as published] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Panayiotarea] It is extremely 
disturbing to read the most unlikely reports against our 
country.... 
  [Pangalos] I would start somewhere else: Let's correct as 
much as we can, because we have responsibilities. From there 
on, I share the common Greek view and the anger over the unjust 
and unjustified attacks. Attacks against the country affect me 
more than attacks against myself. I can endure personal attacks. 
  [Panayiotarea] What can we correct? We always appear with 
our hand extended.... 
  [Pangalos] The country's economy. Depend less on EC loans. 
I don't mean the funds to which we have a right and I reject 
the view that we get a lot of money from the EC. We receive a 
lot because this is what the computer allocates. No one within 
the Community makes gifts. In the future we must avoid EC loans 
so that we may start a procedure that will improve the public 
debt, budget deficit, and inflation. 
  [Panayiotarea] Do the reports represent EC views about 
Greece? 
  [Pangalos] They are malicious. 
  [Panayiotarea] Do they have a particular direction? 
  [Pangalos] I don't know. They are malicious and don't 
represent reality. Our problem is economic, not international 
relations.... 
  [Panayiotarea] This means we cannot raise our voice and at 
the same time plead for a loan. Isn't that it, Minister? 
  [Pangalos] If I know that in a day or two I must ask the 
same 
people I confront today, either newspaper owners or governments, 
to support me economically because I cannot do it myself, then 
inevitably I have a weakness.... 
  [Panayiotarea] Is Skopje another issue on which we 
"inevitably" have a "weakness?" 
  [Pangalos] We handled Skopje very poorly, unskillfully. We 
have gone backward. We were led to a deadlock. We must get out 
of it. The government made a reasonable proposal: Skopje must 
stop behaving in a provocative, expansionist, and irredeemable 
manner. It must abandon its flag, which declares a war against 
Greece by implying territorial pursuits. We will mutually 
guarantee border inviolability and permanency. Skopje must 
change that part of its Constitution that sets out as a goal the 
freeing of...supposed Macedonians. 
  [Panayiotarea] What if your reasonable proposal is not 
accepted? Will we be led to...unreasonableness? 
  [Pangalos] We have spoken. There is no need to run around 
talking continuously, because it shows nervousness in our 
diplomatic relations. It reveals insecurity, something that is 
not my style. I have mentioned Skopje. 
  [Panayiotarea] Do you know that by saying 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
not Skopje, is a priority for you has created a painful 
impression? 
  [Pangalos] ...But we cannot do anything we want in the 
Presidency. We do what the Community wants. Every Greek must 
realize that. The Presidency's role is not to turn the 12 
states into a great Greece. We have made a proposal. Let 
Skopje react. Let's be patient. One of the Greek's greatest 
faults is that he finds it impossible to wait. We honk our 
horns continuously even before the green light comes on. Let's 
wait for the green light. 
  This is enough on Skopje. I want to say nothing else. You 
keep asking: "What are we going to do next?" "Are we going to 
start a dialogue?" My answer is: "I do not know. When it 
happens, we will see." 
  [Panayiotarea] ...and if it does not happen? 
  [Pangalos] Obviously the atmosphere will change for the 
better if it happens. If it does not, there is a great chance 
that the climate will worsen. I can say that now. This is the 
message Skopje receives. I have nothing else to say. 
  [Panayiotarea] Are we ready? 
  [Pangalos] I will answer nothing else. Excuse me for being 
so absolute, but this discussion must close. You must stop 
asking questions on these issues. We must maintain our position 
to appear serious and constant. If you read about Skopje, you 
will see that every two weeks the Greeks made a counterproposal 
that contradicted the previous one. How can our partners or the 
Skopjeans respect us.... [passage omitted] 
  [Panayiotarea] What are you going to do with the white paper 
when average unemployment is 13 percent and the 17 million 
unemployed in Europe are panicking? 
  [Pangalos] This is the main issue. The decisions of the 
latest summit include these proposals. 
  [Panayiotarea] But it is a general framework.... 
  [Pangalos] We will implement the specific Commission 
proposals to secure the necessary concessions.... 
  [Panayiotarea] Some European reports say EC expansion with 
new members will be delayed because of the Greek Presidency. 
  [Pangalos] We have no reason not to support the 
participation 
of new countries. I will remind you that the Greek resistance 
was united with these countries in brotherly relations during 
the dictatorship. They were the only ones to support us. In 
any case, the effort toward 1 March [when Community expansion 
will be discussed] is superhuman. There will be difficulties 
because the internal common view in some member states is 
rejectionist. Anytime a new member is accepted, there is an 
opportunity to settle the various relations on a new basis. 
These are issues that we will handle in the best possible way. 
But we can impose no decisions on anyone. 
  [Panayiotarea] ...What about Cyprus? 
  [Pangalos] It is an additional, national reason for which we 
want the expansion. Cyprus and Malta are small countries that 
will cause the Community no economic problem. Cyprus will even 
finance the Community from its budget. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Andreas Andrianopoulos, New Democracy deputy </F>
and a former minister, by correspondent Andonis Dhelatollas; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dhelatollas] A few days ago, 
Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos said Skopje will 
not be a Greek Presidency issue, but a bilateral one. Do you 
agree? 
  [Andrianopoulos] The Greek Government struggled for two 
years 
to prevent countries, particularly European countries, from 
recognizing Skopje. The Pasok [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] 
government is now saying that Greece will never recognize a 
country with the name "Macedonia!" 
  But was there ever such an issue? The government is simply 
recognizing its weakness and making--hypocritically and 
cowardly--a 180-degree turn. The essence is that Skopje is not 
a bilateral issue--at least not politically. It directly 
concerns Europe and its plans to solve the Bosnian problem. It 
would be a tragic mistake to ignore this reality. 
<H5>  Counterattack </H5>
  [Dhelatollas] The New Democracy chairman said Skopje must 
return to the EC framework. Should we assume that you have 
changed your policy, because a while ago you were speaking about 
the UN procedure? 
  [Andrianopoulos] Abandoning the UN procedure meant that 
Greece abandoned Europe, because it was its initiative to 
mediate and avert "Macedonia's" automatic accession to the 
United Nations and its broad recognition. Bringing the issue 
back to Europe means a return to the United Nations. But why do 
we speak around and not on the issue? 
  The truth is that following recent government moves, Greece 
appears to be losing the battle on Skopje. International 
relations show that you must not see every impasse and problem 
as a threat but look at it as a new opportunity. 
  Maybe this is an opportunity to abandon our incomprehensible 
nationalism on defense, a stance that is unacceptable for our 
dignity and is also unacceptable internationally, and adopt a 
more aggressive stance. We intend to live peacefully with this 
republic but we must make it clear to friends and enemies, 
Skopjeans and others, that if the tiny neighboring state 
provokes Greece at all, we will adopt a coordinated policy of 
questioning its territorial integrity, considering it part of 
Greek Macedonia. 
  Instead of being concerned that it may have plans against 
us, 
we must force everyone to come to us to persuade us not to 
promote extreme and dangerous pursuits. 
  The message of a strong and dignified country will then be 
received. I do not see why we should be the ones to be 
concerned about them and ask others to pressure them to remove 
their provocation. Why shouldn't they be the ones to be 
concerned about us? We are a country that does not beg. We are 
a country that demands. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by </F>
Nicole Pope and Luc Rosenzweig in Ankara on 5 January: "Tansu 
Ciller: `We Are Aiming at Democratization for All of Turkey'" -- 
first paragraph is LE MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] Ankara -- Since assuming power in July 1993, Tansu 
Ciller -- 47 and Turkey's first female prime minister -- has 
primarily aimed to consolidate her position at the head of her 
coalition government comprising the True Path Party (DYP) and 
the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP). As a result of the 
implacable repression against the Kurd separatists of the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] in the southeast of the country and 
abroad, Turkey seems to be a country in the region whose 
stability could be threatened. This is an impression Mrs. Ciller 
tried to dilute by meeting with representatives of the western 
press on 5 January at her residence in Ankara. 
  [LE MONDE] The latest elections in Russia ended with a 
breakthrough by Mr. Zhirinovskiy's ultranationalist party. He 
has made provocative statements about your country. Does that 
worry you? 
  [Ciller] Of course it does. Things are changing in Russia, 
and this process is going to continue. There is a reactionary 
movement in the former Soviet Union, probably caused by the 
economic and political situation in Russia. No matter what 
Boris Yeltsin might think, one theme has now come to the 
surface: A return to the old borders, which is reflected in a 
nationalist attitude toward the republics that have obtained 
their independence. 
  As for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), I think 
Russia is trying to exert pressure on the independent states by 
forcing them to sign bilateral military agreements that will 
result in them being isolated from the rest of the world. From 
whom, for example, are they trying to protect Azerbaijan? From 
Armenia or from the NATO countries, like the United States and 
Turkey? Russia has a tendency to see itself as the sole 
protector of that region against the entire world, and 
especially Europe. We have already stated that Turkey wishes to 
coexist and cooperate with Russia. When I was in Moscow, that is 
what I said to Boris Yeltsin, while at the same time emphasizing 
that we had cultural affinities with those (Turkish speaking -- 
LE MONDE editor's note) countries that have become independent. 
  [LE MONDE] What form could this cooperation take? 
  [Ciller] We are well aware that these countries are destined 
to have close relations with Russia, but we too want to enter 
the playing field -- and why not in the form of triangular 
cooperation instead of competition? For our part, we have 
granted credits on the order of $1.5 to 2 billion to the 
countries of this region, including Armenia, to which we gave 
wheat and medicine when I was economics minister. 
  By way of comparison, the G7 gave between $4 and 5 billion 
in 
credit to Russia alone. This demonstrated our commitment to 
maintaining stability in this part of the world. We are not 
tempted to recreate the old Ottoman empire, nor to return to our 
old borders. What we want, above all, is economic cooperation. 
  [LE MONDE] Does that mean that you will never make a 
military 
commitment in the region, even if the Armenians arrive in Baku? 
  [Ciller] No, I never said that. We are watching what is 
happening very closely -- from one day to the next -- because it 
concerns us. I also told Boris Yeltsin: We feel the Armenians 
should pull out of the conquered territories. When there were 
attacks made recently, Turkey showed that it was rational: When 
Kuwait was attacked, we were there to protest, even though we 
had a border with Iraq. As for Bosnia, we have made a 
commitment, and I intend to go there soon to draw the world's 
attention to the fact that yet again we are watching a massacre 
that is incompatible with human rights. We were in Somalia too. 
  [LE MONDE] Is Turkey ready for customs union with the 
European Union in 1995? [Footnote 2] [The principle of the 
elimination in 1995 of customs barriers between Turkey and the 
European Union has been adopted. Negotiations are under way 
between Ankara and Brussels to settle the details of the matter.] 
  [Ciller] Oh yes! We are moving toward that very quickly. 
It is costing us dearly and is putting a heavy burden on our 
economy. Despite that, we are persisting in pursuing our 
objective. Turkey is one of the most open countries, especially 
toward eastern Europe. This must be acknowledged by our friends 
in Europe and in the European Union, and we must pursue the 
negotiations in this area. There is no other country that has 
taken this step by itself, without receiving some help. If you 
look at what Spain, Portugal, and Greece obtained, there is no 
comparison. It must be acknowledged that Turkey, which is at the 
crossroads of North and South, East and West, is essential for 
the stability of Europe. 
  [LE MONDE] One of the obstacles to your entrance into the 
European Union remains the Cyprus question. Will there be any 
change on this point? 
  [Ciller] First of all, I am anxious to state that we have 
nothing to gain from the impasse in Cyprus. We are in favor of 
a solution accepted by all the parties involved and we want to 
make a contribution to that solution. Please note that I have 
never used this problem in our debates on domestic policy, as I 
could have done. 
  [LE MONDE] Do you think that the arrival of a new government 
in northern Cyprus will help solve the problem? Are you 
prepared to hand back part of the territory conquered to reach a 
solution? 
  [Ciller] We are more open to peace than we have ever been. I 
would like to see a similar attitude from the Greek side. The 
return of territory is not the main issue. It is essential that 
the two communities agree on a durable solution. To achieve 
that, many things must be done. As for us, our hands are not 
tied. 
  [LE MONDE] Do you think that the Greek Presidency of the 
European Union will hinder you in the next six months? 
  [Ciller] That is just a minor point. The essential thing is 
that the other countries of the European Union see our vitality 
and feel that rapprochement with Turkey is something that can 
benefit everyone. 
  [LE MONDE] In recent months we have seen a worsening in the 
conflict between the government forces and the Kurd separatists. 
How do you gauge the attitude of the European countries on this 
matter? 
  [Ciller] We have always said that, according to the 
principle 
of communicating vessels, if organizations are declared illegal 
in one country -- in Germany for example -- terrorism will move 
to another country. The United Kingdom, France, and even the 
Netherlands, where no [Kurd] organization has ever been banned, 
have become aware of this. I think it is high time to tackle 
this problem. We share the same values: democracy, the 
protection of human rights, and we must support each other. We 
must not mix up the problem of the PKK with the problem of the 
Kurds living in Turkey or elsewhere in the world. In 1993, 
2,000 people were killed in Turkey. The vast majority of them 
were Kurds killed by the PKK. We are trying to protect our 
citizens, whatever their origin. 
  [LE MONDE] For you, is not the only solution to the PKK 
problem a military solution? 
  [Ciller] I spent the New Year in southeast Anatolia. In the 
streets and on the balconies, the attitude of the people toward 
me was the same as in any other Turkish town: There were large 
displays of affection for me in a relaxed atmosphere. That is 
the situation. The people are afraid of the PKK and they want 
the Turkish state to protect their lives and give them work. We 
are investing more than 11 times the amount in this region than 
we are taking out. 
  We believe in the process of democratization and we are 
going 
to take major steps in that direction. Please note that this is 
not a concession to the PKK. Democracy has already traveled a 
long road in this country since the 1940's. We are going to 
continue. We are aiming at democratization, not only for this 
region, but for all of Turkey. 
  I would emphasize that there is no minority in this country: 
Everyone has the right to vote and can be elected to Parliament. 
Some of the most important members of my government are Kurds 
and, when I appointed them, I did not even ask myself about 
their origin.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with National Defense Minister Mehmet </F>
Golhan by Mehmet Ali Birand; place not specified -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Birand] How are you, Mr. Minister. 
  [Golhan] Fine, thank you. This is the first time in 15 years 
I have attended the opera. I have left the hall to watch your 
program. 
  [Birand] We thank you. Hundreds of thousands of people are 
waiting to hear what you have to say. We are sorry to have 
interrupted your opera. What I would like to ask is the 
following: Military affairs are always planned in advance. We 
are well aware that both the National Defense Ministry and the 
Chief of the General Staff's Office are very meticulous on the 
issue. It was your government that shortened the military 
service. Were you not aware that you would be faced with the 
current situation? If you were aware, then why did you shorten 
it? This is what everyone wants to know. 
  [Golhan] Mr. Birand, naturally the problems and the 
potential 
risk facing Turkey when we shortened military service and the 
situation about a month or two ago -- or even the current 
situation -- are very different. In other words, we did shorten 
the military service from 18 to 15 months last year. It was the 
right decision at the time. Since then, however, certain 
changes have taken place in our neighbors. I would not like to 
name them now. Everyone is well aware to whom I am referring 
and which countries I would like to include in this basket. Our 
viewers are very intelligent and they will understand. If, 
however, I name names now, then there will be talk about the 
defense minister creating adversity against that country. 
Certain conclusions will be drawn. The foreign threat Turkey 
was facing yesterday is different than the one it is facing 
today. The current potential foreign threat is very different 
than the one in the past. This is the first issue. 
  Secondly, we have for the last five or six months been 
repeatedly saying that we should be taking every necessary 
measure to end the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] curse we are 
facing. These operations will be concluded this winter and 
spring. Turkey will be rid of this problem. We have, for the 
last six months, been saying loudly that every possible measure 
will be taken to render these bandits ineffective. No doubt, 
certain decisions have to be taken in connection with these 
measures. These are the reasons for deferring the discharges 
from the armed forces. 
  [Birand] Mr. Minister, the PKK problem existed last year as 
well. In other words, this problem existed when your government 
shortened the military service. As far as I know, threats 
against our country, whether they are from Syria, Russia, the 
Caucasus, or any other country, have not increased in the last 
few months. There is something here that no one can 
understand... 
  [Golhan] Mr. Birand, I am sure you read the papers. 
  [Birand] I read much more than the papers. 
  [Golhan] Our viewers also read the papers. Have you not 
heard the voices rising from one of our neighboring countries? 
It was in the papers yesterday and today. 
  [Birand] Obviously, but Mr. Minister... 
  [Golhan] Did they exist yesterday? Did they exist five 
months ago? They did not, categorically not. 
  [Birand] I do not believe that you can counter a threat 
against Turkey from Russia, Syria, Iran, or Iraq with 110,000 
soldiers. What I am saying is that there is a mathematical 
error here. 
  [Golhan] There is no mathematical error. Turkey has not 
declared mobilization. We are not seeking a mobilization cadre. 
  [Birand] This is the atmosphere that has been created. 
  [Golhan] We are obliged to maintain our peace cadres. We are 
obliged to maintain this cadre. This is what we are doing. 
Furthermore, it is obvious that we cannot discharge the current 
soldiers and place the new young recruits, who are fresh out of 
training and inexperienced in guerrilla warfare, to fight the 
PKK. 
  [Birand] Could you not have met this shortage by 
transferring 
troops from other regions? May God bless it, we do have a large 
army. 
  [Golhan] You cannot do that. As I have said earlier, Turkey 
is facing certain risks. In many regions you cannot reduce the 
number of troops to zero. You cannot reduce the forces and 
units deployed in certain regions. You cannot do that. We are 
implementing certain transfer of forces anyway. You cannot 
reduce the number of troops below a certain level. There are 
certain rules in the military. There are possible risks, 
threats which have to be taken into consideration. 
  [Birand] Did the reaction to the decision disturb you? You 
are a politician and it was your government -- although you were 
not the defense minister at the time -- that first reduced the 
military service and is now increasing it. 
  [Golhan] This is not true. We have not yet increased it. 
This is only a measure. We have told you that we will be 
carrying out an operation during the winter and spring. The PKK 
will definitely be rendered ineffective. In order to fulfill 
that promise, we need experienced soldiers who are familiar with 
the region. 
  [Birand] What you are trying to say is that military service 
will be reduced again when the PKK is defeated. Is that the 
message? 
  [Golhan] Naturally; the extension is on a one-time basis. 
The discharge of soldiers who were to be released in February 
and May has been deferred, on a one-time basis, for four months. 
This was the decision made by the Council of Ministers. 
  [Birand] Does this mean that the next batch will serve a 
shorter term? 
  [Golhan] Naturally, if Turkey attains the goals we have set. 
The government is determined on the issue. No matter what the 
consequences. 
  [Birand] Then there is a condition. 
  [Golhan] Of course there are conditions. The conditions were 
different yesterday and they have changed today. I hope Turkey 
will not be worse off in the next five to 10 months. I hope the 
situation will not be more critical. 
  [Birand] If we want to summarize the conditions based on 
what 
you have told us, military service will be reduced after the PKK 
is defeated, and after Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Russia stop being 
a threat. 
  [Golhan] I am not naming names. I am not naming the 
neighbors, you are. 
  [Birand] Yes, I am naming them not you. 
  [Golhan] You will remember, elections were held in our 
neighboring countries. You are also aware of the foundation 
these elections were based on. 
  [Birand] Then those who will be drafted in the future will 
have to wait a while for these conditions to be fulfilled. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Golhan] Turkey has always aspired for peace. For the last 
70 years, we have been repeating the slogan "Peace at home, 
peace in the world." In spite of this, you are well aware that 
certain of our neighbors view Turkey as a potential threat and 
plan their deployment accordingly. 
  [Birand] In a while, we will be broadcasting an interview 
with Zhirinovskiy, who described Turkey as a threat. 
  [Golhan] See, you have already disclosed one of them.

  [Text] The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the General 
Staff have not confirmed the reports that the Turkish Armed 
Forces have carried out a cross-border operation into Syria. 
Stressing that the question of cross-border operations is 
always on Turkey's agenda, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said: 
"However, the latest operation must not be regarded as one 
specially planned for Syria." 
  Meanwhile, Internal Affairs Minister Nahit Mentese has also 
denied the reports on a cross-border operation into Syria. 
Stressing that the security forces launched an operation the 
night before last in the Suruc District of Sanliurfa, which is 
on Turkey's border with Syria, Mentese said: "The operation in 
Suruc is continuing. Suruc and Syria may have been confused. 
Six terrorists have been killed or captured in the operation 
thus far." 
  Mentese also said an operation was carried out in Tunceli at 
about the same time. Five terrorists were killed or captured. 
  The officials affiliated with the General Staff have said 
the 
operation in Suruc may have been regarded as one aimed at Syria. 
Stressing that a cross-border operation into Syria has not taken 
place, the officials said the operation in Suruc is continuing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovsky by Hakan Aksay in </F>
Moscow; date not given -- recorded; Zhirinovsky speaks in 
Turkish] 
  [Text] During his interview with Zhirinovsky, our colleague 
Hakan Aksay immediately came to the point and asked the Russian 
politician what he thinks about Turkey. But Zhirinovsky had no 
intention of coming to the point, and launched into a long 
discourse on territorial issues. Territorial problems have 
become a virtual fixation for the Russian politician. Next, our 
colleague asked what he thinks about being compared to Hitler. 
His reply was a bit odd: 
  [Begin recording] [Zhirinovsky] One of your writers said: We 
are neither rightists nor leftists, we are only footballists. 
Similarly, we too are neither rightists nor leftists, but only 
centrists. We are to the right of center. It could be that we 
are slightly to the right of center by some 20 percent, just 
like you. You have the True Path Party once lead by Suleyman 
Demirel. On his Ankara party headquarters, it was once written: 
The future rests with the father. 
  It wanted to say that Demirel would become president in the 
future. And, in fact he became president. 
  [Aksay] And are you going to become the father of Russia? 
  [Zhirinovsky] Yes, Russia's father. Is Demirel a fascist? 
Never. I will be just like him in Russia. 
  [Aksay] You mean to say that you could become Russia's 
Demirel, that is, Russia's father? 
  [Zhirinovsky] Yes, yes, yes. [end recording] 
  When Turkey is mentioned, Zhirinovsky constantly speaks 
about 
Pan-Turanism. He often mentions the name of Alparslan Turkes 
and goes into a long exposition of Pan-Turkism. He then said: 
  [Begin recording] [Zhirinovsky] Very good conditions exist 
for you to create a Turan in this region, Caucasia -- your next 
door neighbor Azerbaijan speaks Turkish; they are of your own 
people -- and Turkmenistan. There are Turkish speaking peoples 
over a compact region. Culture and religion are all identical. 
This is very good for you. Had I been a Turk, I would have 
done this [create a Pan-Turkic state]. Had I been in the place 
of Alparslan Turkes, I would have established the same party and 
now I would have worked to bring all the former Soviet Central 
Asian republics closer to Turkey, to tie them to it, and one day 
to establish one single state. I would have done this. 
  [Aksay] Is this why Turkey is a threat? Is it a threat 
because it might unite the other Turks? 
  [Zhirinovsky] Yes, yes, yes, yes.... 
  [Aksay, interrupting] But, as you know, the Pan-Turanists 
and 
Pan-Turkists are not in power in Turkey. 
  [Zhirinovsky] Yes, not now, but they could be in the future. 
It is better for Russia that there should be a common border 
between Russia and Turkey, without the Caucasus, Armenia, 
Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Only Turkey and Russia. That will be 
sufficient. [end recording] 
  Yet another gaffe from Zhirinovsky. In reply to Aksay's 
question, he gave a reply that is cause for thought. 
  [Begin recording] [Aksay] You are saying Turkey does not 
really have a culture of its own, and that the Turks still pass 
off the Byzantine culture in Istanbul as their own. Does your 
lack of knowledge of Turkey's culture and your statement that 
the world will lose nothing if the Turkish culture vanishes not 
reflect a negative attitude toward Turkey? 
  [Zhirinovsky] The Turkish culture could grow like a flower 
in 
the Tashkent region, because that is exactly the place for you. 
Below that are the Persian-speaking Afghanistan and Tajikistan, 
and to the north is Russia. But the Tashkent-Ashgabat region is 
your motherland. You have the Motherland Party, and your 
motherland lies between Tashkent and Ashgabat. One day in the 
past, your Ottoman Turkish armies marched into the Byzantine 
lands from this very region between Tashkent and Ashgabat. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mehetsah Yildiz, OZGUR GUNDEM journalist, by </F>
Monika Hoehn; place and date not given: "If This Is Democracy, 
I Am Against It"] 
  [Text] At noon on 25 November 1993, on the road from 
Diyarbakir to Bismil: A police patrol arrests a group involved 
with caring for Kurdish refugees in the FRG. On their trip to 
the victims of Turkish terror in Kurdistan, they were 
accompanied by two journalists from the daily OZGUR GUNDEM. The 
Germans are now safe again, as opposed to their comrades. 
  Monika Hoehn talked to OZGUR GUNDEM journalist Mehetsah 
Yildiz, one of her colleagues, following their release. 
  [Hoehn] What sort of reprisals are you subject to in your 
work as a journalist? 
  [Yildiz] Our newspaper and its employees are constantly 
subjected to reprisals. So far, nine employees have been 
arrested. Some of my colleagues were imprisoned for three and 
sometimes four months and tortured in prison -- even though 
there was no evidence of guilt on their part. We are persecuted 
because we are against the war and report on the war 
objectively. The Turkish Government and its security forces do 
not want to let us investigate and work in peace. There is no 
freedom of the press of any kind. After the threat, I went from 
Batman to Diyarbakir. Nothing happened there until I was 
arrested with you. 
  There is no doubt that our life is in danger. However, there 
is a standard for correspondents -- namely, to tell the truth -- 
and we are doing this work by risking our life. We do this for 
our people who are tortured and massacred, and who live in 
misery. 
  [Hoehn] You said torture is an everyday occurrence, and that 
you live with it. How is this possible in a country described 
by Prime Minister Ciller as a pioneer of democracy and human 
rights? 
  [Yildiz] Every day 30 soldiers and a few guerillas and 
civilians are shot dead. Nevertheless, Mrs. Ciller says there 
are only a few terrorist actions and there is no war. There is 
a war of intimidation underway, and murders are committed by 
unknown perpetrators. There are 200 arrests every day. They 
all take place under the aegis of the state of emergency. One 
must ask why these people are killed. There is a war between 
the Turkish Army and the Kurdish people. 
  [Hoehn] What personal reprisals have you suffered? 
  [Yildiz] In Izmir I was arrested by the police because of an 
investigation. Some time later, the police broke into my 
apartment again. On 1 May, I was arrested again and spent three 
months in prison. Then I went to Batman. On 12 September 1993, 
around 2230 -- we were sleeping in our office -- a bomb was 
thrown into our office. One minute later the police chief and 
his deputy were there. They lined us up against the wall and 
asked us why we wanted to blow up our office. Then the deputy 
of the political police beat me, held a gun to my head, and said 
we should get lost or they would kill us. 
  They stole my money (6 million Turkish lira) and the 
electrical equipment. The same night, they took me to the 
"Antiterrorism" Department of the Political Police. They 
tortured me and my colleague for three days. 
  The torture consists of having your arms tied behind your 
back and being pulled up with a rope or a chain until your arms 
slide out of their sockets and you faints. You are brought back 
to consciousness with electrical charges to your feet or 
genitalia. All in all, we were in prison for 10 days before we 
were finally taken to a judge. In order to hide the evidence of 
torture, they washed us and treated us with ointments every day. 
And there were constant threats: "Get out of here, or we will 
kill you." 
  Then we were taken to court. When it turned out that we were 
innocent, we were released. 
  When I was released, I went to the Human Rights Foundation 
in 
Izmir. This is not a state institution, but a medical 
institution. They said I should not move my arms for six months 
and that I would bear the traces of torture for a long time. I 
still have scars below the shoulder blades. Sometimes I cannot 
even remember the names of my two children. 
  [Hoehn] Mehmetsah, do you have hopes and wishes that I could 
tell my fellow-citizens? 
  [Yildiz] We would like to stress, above all, that we are 
journalists and not armed militants. Nevertheless, the state 
harasses and tortures us. In 1993 at least 10 persons were 
killed as a result of torture. When Mrs. Ciller claims this is 
Turkish democracy, then it ought to be possible to invite 
investigations and international observers. Abuses in torture 
chambers are an effort to destroy people's personality and to 
plant crimes on them. In Kurdistan there is practically no one 
left who has not been tortured at least once. If Mrs. Ciller 
claims we have democracy here, then I am against this democracy. 
It is good when foreign observer delegations come here, because 
they have the opportunity to report torture and reprisals. It 
is our hope that the world public will not keep silent about the 
genocide and reprisals of the Turkish state against the Kurdish 
people. We want the world public to become sensitized to what 
is really going on here.

<F P=106> [Report signed "C.G.": "Kinkel Expresses Understanding for </F>
Poland"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 9 Jan -- Foreign Minister Kinkel has met 
Polish Foreign Minister Olechowski in Berlin to discuss Warsaw's 
wish to join NATO. Kinkel expressed understanding for Poland's 
calls for clear-cut prospects regarding NATO membership. Germany 
sees itself as an advocate acting on behalf of the reformist 
states of Central and East Europe. Kinkel said Poland's 
admission to the alliance could be the result of an 
"evolutionary process" first of all, but at the NATO conference, 
Germany would urge that an unmistakable sign be given "that the 
alliance is essentially open to new members." Chancellor Kohl 
has said NATO's offer of Partnership for Peace should not just 
amount to a diplomatic formula, but must contain "a clear-cut 
statement of future prospects for admission to NATO." It is 
also being said in Bonn that Kohl is counting on bringing the 
Central European states Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic 
into European Union structures. Even if they are not full EU 
members, Kohl is evidently thinking about involving those 
countries in European political cooperation with their status to 
be established at some later date.

  [Text] [Koch] Mr. Scharping, our East European neighbors 
are pushing themselves under NATO's protective shield because 
they are afraid of Russia.... 
  [Scharping] The fear of the Central and East European states 
that they will once again be dominated by Moscow as in the past 
must be taken seriously. The supreme goal is security. 
  Therefore, it is useful to give states such as Poland, 
Hungary, and Czechia, and perhaps even Slovakia and others, a 
security policy prospect by using the existing instruments of 
NATO and CSCE. 
  [Koch] Can this be done overnight? 
  [Scharping] No, one must also take the legitimate security 
interests of Russia and the other CIS states into account. 
  We must not give any cheap excuses to the nationalist, 
partly 
fascist, and in any case antiwestern and antidemocratic forces 
in Russia. Therefore, this will have to be a step-by-step 
process, which particularly must not ignore the economic side. 
There are large markets for us in the East. 
  [Koch] Should Russia also become a NATO member in the long 
run? 
  [Scharping] I think Russia's accession to NATO is not 
realistic from today's point of view.

<F P=106> [Herbert Kremp commentary: "NATO's Arthur's Round Closes the </F>
Window"] 
  [Text] "We await and welcome the expansion of NATO." This 
will be the key phrase at the forthcoming Atlantic alliance 
summit in Brussels. But even this phrase, which indicates the 
alliance's possible opening toward the East, is not undisputed. 
It was not the French or the Germans who voiced doubts, but the 
British. During the marathon talks on the communique, which 
always precede important conferences, London was worried that 
the gradual inclusion of "interested" East European countries 
could turn into a slide leading to incalculable risks. 
  This is, of course, something everybody wants to avoid, 
including the U.S., who coined the phrase quoted above. The 
Partnership for Peace model, envisaged as a number of bilateral 
agreements with the former frontline states of the Warsaw Pact, 
is double-edged. It provides for military cooperation that 
remains below the threshold of the NATO guarantee for mutual 
assistance and does not exclude consultations in the event of a 
threat to political independence and security. The states will 
not be under the "roof," but under its shadow. 
  The heads of state and government are highly interested in 
including Russia in a comprehensive security structure -- but 
not in this specific partnership model. The school of thought 
trying to achieve this as well will not succeed. On the other 
hand, any signs indicating that Russia is actively excluded from 
the European security framework are to be avoided. It is 
doubtful whether this will succeed. Russian politics thinks in 
conspiratorial ways as a matter of principle -- the changes have 
left this unaltered. The fear of being isolated spreads 
quickly, and it can be spread quickly -- refusing a visa can be 
enough. Following Lithuania's formal application for membership, 
Yeltsin once again explicitly warned NATO against "expansion." 
His Brussels statement that he would have to "build a Berlin 
Wall" on the Russian border, if necessary, has never been denied. 
  The question, discussed since Travemuende, as to whether the 
Partnership for Peace model with bilateral agreements and 
operative measures is the final or the starting point for NATO 
expansion will not be answered after the summit either. For the 
alliance, this process, which goes far beyond the club-like 
character of the Cooperation Council, is a great achievement. 
But on the other hand, the countries of East Europe know that 
there is no alternative to a formal integration into the 
alliance and its guarantee of assistance. 
  The terminally ill Hungarian [Prime Minister] Antall summed 
it all up like this: "Yeltsin is ill, Zhirinovksiy is healthy." 
Speaking in Brussels in December, Ukraine Chief of Staff Lopata 
described Moscow's policy of trying to destabilize his country. 
He quoted a proverb: "When it gets cold in Moscow, Kiev 
freezes over." 
  The East Europeans cannot help but be dissatisfied. The 
worst thing that could happen to these states is that the past 
is continued in a new "intermediate Europe." In Warsaw, Prague, 
and Budapest, where all sorts of crises have led to a high level 
of clear-sightedness, one speaks of the West's historical and 
moral failure. This is also said with a view to the Balkans. 
And this has had its effects. Lopata said there are two 
schools of thought in Ukraine: One wants to orient itself 
toward the West, the other toward Moscow. All the countries in 
our eastern vicinity will get to this crossroads tomorrow or the 
day after. These states are looking for support from West 
Europe and the United States. But their aspirations could well 
end in a repetition of old tragedies. 
  Germany would be involved in this tragedy. For, unless 
partnership with NATO can be turned into membership, that is, if 
NATO's opening up remains limited and does not offer any real 
security, Germany will lose the historic opportunity of being 
"surrounded by friends" -- as Volker Ruehe put it -- for the 
first time since it became a nation state. Germany would not be 
able to push through this vision against its partners' will in 
NATO's Arthur's Round. But even Germany does not vehemently 
speak out for this opportunity, which is dependent on the given 
times and situations, and which, like the "window" with which it 
is compared, is already closing again.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Jochen Siemens: "Partnership for Peace"] </F>
  [Text] Lasting peace and security in the European house 
cannot be implemented without Russia's involvement and 
cooperation. This is a fact. It is also a lesson of history 
that remains valid in the current search for new security policy 
concepts. We should not miss the opportunity to bear this 
lesson in mind without surrendering to its -- currently utopian 
-- implications. That is why at the NATO summit in Brussels on 
10 and 11 January, the 16 members will not reproach one another 
for having a "Russia first" approach to security policy and for 
betraying the legitimate interests of NATO's East European 
neighbors, or for pursuing the old way of thinking and intending 
to isolate Russia by extending NATO to the Belarusian or 
Ukrainian border. 
  Rather it is important to bring clarity into the discussion. 
One should not promise more than one can deliver. The NATO 
members, in particular the United States, are currently not 
ready to extend the security guarantees of the NATO treaty to 
new members. But this is what Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Hungary, and Lithuania mean when they ask for 
membership within the alliance. It would not be serious to 
believe that any promises to this effect could currently be 
enforced in the alliance. What is important in a military 
alliance -- if anything -- is dependability. A NATO that gives 
guarantees it knows it cannot implement had better dissolve 
itself. 
  It is equally hypocritical of the applicant members to 
stress 
that their planned NATO membership is not directed against 
Russia. No matter how loquaciously and elegantly it is adorned, 
the East Europeans -- historically misused by Russia, Germany, 
and the Habsburg Empire -- are seeking protection against Russia 
within NATO, because no one can predict today whether Russia 
will be able to successfully continue its development toward an 
open, democratic society. 
  That is why it is important in the present situation to do 
one thing, without failing to do the other thing. Just as it 
would be wrong to promise more than one can deliver, it would 
also be wrong to offer the East European neighbors less than is 
possible and necessary. That is why we must expect the NATO 
summit to define the offers of cooperation with the East 
Europeans, mentioned in the Partnership for Peace concept, as 
specifically as possible. The core and value of NATO are its 
military organization, its command structures, and its 
logistics. The task in the next few years will be to further 
this organization's cooperation with the military of the Eastern 
neighbors, ranging from the exchange of ambassadors and staffs 
and common military exercises, to the alignment of 
communications structures. It is also conceivable to make 
military reconnaissance facilities available to the East 
Europeans. All this must be regulated by agreement, while 
association with the Western European Union [WEU] must be pushed 
and membership of the East Europeans within the European Union 
[EU] must be kept in mind. 
  Given this large number of concrete options, it is possible 
to meet the applicants' understandable wish not to get stuck in 
a gray zone of promises that are intended never to be fulfilled. 
At the same time, however, NATO also serves its own interests. 
In a world in which the lion will never lie down with the lamb, 
NATO must keep its own inner coherence in mind. Its members' 
military budgets and troop strengths are drastically decreasing. 
The alliance must cope with this and remain effective 
nevertheless; it must also keep the relationship between Europe 
and North America close and strong. 
  Binding the East Europeans more specifically to NATO, the 
WEU, and the EU will strengthen the democratic processes in 
these countries without dragging the West, through security 
guarantees, into unpredictable minority conflicts and border 
disputes. Human rights and border guarantees in and between 
applicant countries must be settled prior to the enlargement of 
NATO. The example of Turkey and Greece has shown NATO the 
problems with which an alliance may otherwise be confronted. 
  Finally, a concretely defined Partnership for Peace will 
also 
meet the criteria of a policy that keeps options toward Russia 
open. It can only be in the interests of NATO and the applicant 
countries that Russia continues to develop as a democratic, open 
society. It would be wrong to give the people and political 
forces the impression that the West wanted to isolate Russia. 
Russia can only isolate itself by once again getting on 
imperialist tracks that threaten borders and neighbors. It is 
right and legitimate for us to brace ourselves for such a 
danger. This is accomplished by closer cooperation with the 
East Europeans. Until such a danger emerges, however, we must 
not create new bogeymen, but build the European house through 
common effort.

<F P=106> [Volker Zastrow article: "Clinton's European Year"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 9 Jan -- President Clinton will begin 
his "European year" by participating in the Brussels NATO 
conference this Monday [10 January]. That there is lot of 
catching up to be done is beyond any doubt. So, on his first 
stop, the Western alliance is to be attended to, it is to be 
rejuvenated internally, and there is to be at least some opening 
up eastward. In addition, there is the declared intention of 
bolstering the United States transatlantic commitment. The 
second stop, Prague, involves constructively pacifying the four 
states that would like to join NATO: Poland, Slovakia, the 
Czech Republic, and Hungary. In Moscow, support for President 
Yeltsin and Russia's reform policies is at the forefront. Then, 
in Minsk, a "nuclear-free" Belarus -- and perhaps Ukraine's 
President Kravchuk at the very last moment -- will be rewarded 
with courteous recognition. After that, there is to be a final 
trip to Geneva, where Syria's President Assad is to be once 
again admitted to the community of international politicians 
with whom talks can be held. 
  Clinton's first European trip since assuming office last 
January follows a period -- one recently heavily criticized in 
Washington -- of neglect and rapt disinterest. This has 
entailed a mixture of basic, but diffuse good intentions on the 
part on the new government (toward Germany for example) along 
with ominous statements such as those made by Foreign Minister 
Christopher on how the Americans' "Eurocentric" conduct was over 
and that Asia had now become "the most important region" for 
them. This was then modified in connection with Clinton's 
travel preparations and was most recently expressed by Vice 
President Gore in the terms: "If Europe is at war, we suffer. 
If Europe is secure and free, we prosper." 
  However, something of an aftertaste has remained and has 
been 
strengthened even more by the escalation of the war in the 
Balkans. Frustrated by European disagreement and manacled by 
Congress, Clinton does not even want to touch this particular 
conflict with a barge pole. Every shell that hits Sarajevo can 
prompt questions in Brussels about the practical value of a 
Partnership for Peace with an Alliance that has done so little 
in Southeastern Europe over such a long time. As the WASHINGTON 
POST assessed the issue at the weekend, Bosnia is the "skunk at 
the garden party" NATO is staging. It is true that the French 
let the Americans know that they wanted the question to appear 
at the top of the agenda, but how little that has to do with the 
wishes of the Washington administration was apparent at the last 
joint press conference staged by Secretary of State Christopher 
and [former] Secretary of Defense Aspin before the visit. They 
themselves said nothing about the Balkans; when asked, they 
evaded the issue, using meaningless formulas. 
  Apart from domestic policy, which interests him and led to 
his election, Clinton primarily concerned himself with 
international economic policy issues during his first year in 
office. The exception was the sudden "summit" with the 
beleaguered Yeltsin in Vancouver last February. There, he made 
personal and political support for the "security partner" in 
Moscow a constant element in his foreign policy. Then, in July, 
he traveled to the meeting of the "big seven" in Tokyo and 
afterward visited America's Asian ally, South Korea. In 
November, he hosted the first Asian-Pacific Economic Conference 
(APEC) in Seattle. He also campaigned successfully for the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), attended to 
relations with neighboring Mexico and Canada, and helped bring 
about a worthy end to the GATT negotiations on an international 
agreement on tariffs and trade. 
  This year, he wants to visit "the Old World" on four 
occasions. After the talks this week, he will visit Normandy in 
May on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the World War II 
allied invasion, and that will be followed by a visit to Great 
Britain. In July, following the "G-7" summit in Naples, he 
wants to go to Germany, and then in the fall he wants to take 
part in the CSCE conference in Hungary. In the meantime, there 
will be no end to the flow of visitors to Washington. 
Chancellor Kohl will be the first guest Clinton will receive in 
Washington at the end of the month, after he has returned from 
Geneva and has delivered his State of the Union address to 
Congress (25 January). 
  It would seem that the leaders with whom Clinton has the 
closest contacts in Europe and the ones in which he places the 
greatest trust are Kohl and Yeltsin. In his dealings with them, 
he even appears to equal his predecessor, the tireless 
"telephone diplomat" Bush. By contrast, the "chemistry" between 
Clinton and British Prime Minister Major -- the White House has 
not forgotten that he assisted Bush in the elections -- leaves 
something to be desired. French President Mitterrand has, in 
Washington's eyes, lost importance, because of his weak position 
in domestic politics. 
  In Brussels, Clinton will still be accompanied by outgoing 
Defense Secretary Aspin and then -- for the second time -- by 
Treasury Secretary Bentsen to a meeting with Yeltsin. He will 
be accompanied by Secretary of State Christopher as well as his 
newly appointed deputy, the "Russia czar" Talbott, who with new 
Defense Secretary Inman, will play a key role in the changed 
security policy team. It was above all on the advice of his 
friend from his days as a student that Clinton decided not to 
offer the Visegrad states full NATO membership, because of 
consideration for Russia and Ukraine. On Talbott's advice and 
because of consideration for Yeltsin, when Clinton is in Moscow 
he will avoid the Russian ultranationalist Zhirinovskiy, who has 
told Clinton that it would be better for him to stay at home and 
"play the saxophone." 
  Over the past few weeks, Clinton has devoted more time to 
foreign policy than ever before and diligently studied his 
colleagues' "scripts." With his natural American openness, he 
will not find it difficult to leave behind the impression of a 
well-meaning partner in Brussels, Prague, and Moscow. Regarding 
his role as the president of the "last world power," however, 
the question that remains is about his desire to provide 
leadership, about his "vision of the time after the Cold War," 
which has only been outlined so far, and the reliability of his 
commitment to security policy, which now only involves the 
presence of about 100,000 U.S. soldiers on the continent 
(compared to almost 400,000 in the past). 
  Regarding the Europeans' "defense identity," Clinton takes a 
more relaxed approach than his predecessors Bush and Reagan. 
Without flinching, he can accept the Franco-German Eurocorps as 
well as a possible strengthening of the WEU, which some NATO 
purists see as a "rival" organization. What is still not that 
obvious, however, is whether this relaxed approach is based on 
respectful confidence in the Europeans or has more to do with a 
lack of interest. 
  This week, Clinton has an opportunity to bolster his image, 
to strengthen America's claim to leadership, which is no longer 
seen that unfavorably in Europe, and in doing so, give the 
jubilant communists and cryptofascists from Belgrade to Moscow 
something to think about. If he has a plausible concept and can 
formulate a credible leitmotif out of it, he does not need to 
become bogged down in details. In 1973, Richard Nixon, the last 
president to declare a "European year," was also only concerned 
about general directions. Thanks to the Watergate tapes, one 
knows how little importance he attached to minor continental 
matters. Thus, at the time he said -- in a linguistically 
cleaned up form -- that "the lira is of no darned interest to 
me."

<F P=106> [Hans Joerg Sottorf article: "Germany To Assume the Role of </F>
Advocate"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 8-9 Jan -- Numerous views were expressed in 
Bonn in the past few days before the NATO summit in Brussels. 
The same question was raised time and again: To what extent 
should the North Atlantic defense alliance, whose meaning and 
purpose must be redefined as a result of the changed world 
political situation, open up to the Central and East European 
states without offending Russia? 
  The confusion of voices culminated in reports on a quarrel 
between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe, which were quickly denied, however. Differences of 
opinion between Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Ruehe were 
also detected in the statements they issued. 
  If one analyzes the flood of declarations and listens 
carefully to the voices in the political camps, one discovers 
more agreement than one would at a superficial glance. Bonn 
advocates the integration of the Central and East European 
states into a new security architecture whose core should be 
NATO. The problems that might arise for Russia from a sudden 
NATO expansion to its borders are apparent, however. On the 
other hand, Bonn wants security agreements with Moscow. 
Russia's membership seems ideal, but is not feasible because of 
the domestic political problems in the eastern part of the huge 
empire. Moreover, no president -- no matter what his name is -- 
would be able to implement that. 
  Basically, the differences of opinion in Bonn concern the 
right steps and the appropriate way as to how to shape the 
complicated security-political relations between the old NATO 
countries and the former members of the Warsaw Pact, some of 
whom are urgently pressing for NATO protection. Bonn's defense 
politicians have adopted a pragmatic approach. They claim the 
larger NATO is, the smaller is the danger that Russia might seek 
military adventures in the old Soviet sphere of influence. 
  Bonn's foreign policy experts, however, recommend cautious 
steps toward a rapprochement with the Central and East European 
states, in order to prevent sudden conflicts. Bonn's Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, who has been advocating long-term 
thinking on this issue for some time, naturally plays a major 
role here. Shortly before the beginning of the NATO summit, he 
spoke of a very difficult dilemma that NATO, and in particular 
Germany, will have to solve. A "double message" must be 
conveyed to the Central and East European countries: Basically, 
NATO wants to be open for new members. On the other hand, 
however, this is a lengthy process, and it will not be possible 
for them to join the Alliance as fast as some would like. There 
is no order and no timetable for new members. The only thing 
Kinkel wants to promise for the time being is consultations at 
the political level. 
  Germany's special position is characterized by the fact that 
the Central and East European states view Germany as the 
advocate of their interests in the expansion of cooperation. 
Besides Kinkel, Chancellor Kohl also made it clear that Bonn 
must link two goals: The justified security needs of the Eastern 
neighboring countries must be taken seriously, but at the same 
time security relations must be developed with Russia. Kinkel 
is right: This will be a difficult balancing act.

<F P=106> [Article by Winfried Muenster: "Back Door for East European </F>
NATO Membership"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 9 Jan -- The formula Partnership for 
Peace, which allows our East European neighboring states to 
enter the NATO waiting room, has at least been accepted on this 
side of the Oder and Neisse. It has never really been 
controversial among the 16 Western member states that are 
starting a summit in Brussels today. Not one of them presently 
knows how the security needs of the East Europeans can be met in 
a satisfactory manner. Thus, all rely on the old saying: Time 
will tell. 
  However, some European allies believe (or are afraid) that 
the problem concerning the alliance's expansion will worsen in 
the United States because Congress is likely to reject 
additional assistance guarantees. At this point, however, one 
country -- France -- views itself as the winner of the current 
discussion about the eastward expansion of the alliance. It 
advocates the establishment of security links with the East 
European states in a roundabout way: Once they are members of 
the European Union, it would be possible for them to join the 
Western European Union [WEU], a purely Western assistance pact. 
  German Defense Minister Ruehe hinted at the meeting of the 
NATO planning committee four weeks ago -- was it furtively or 
roguishly? -- that the West Europeans, the members of the 
European Union at least, are not really free to decide whether 
they want the East Europeans to be their allies or not. 
Moreover, the West is not really seeking this option. Those 
East Europeans to whom the European Union has opened up the 
possibility of membership will be invited to actively 
participate in the WEU. Once they are accepted by the European 
Union, they are also entitled to become full members of the WEU, 
an alliance that -- even if not formally -- is part of 
European-American NATO. 
  From this perspective, the current discussion about NATO's 
eastward expansion is a great deal of fuss about little. In 
fact, British and French NATO officials occasionally voice their 
unease. After all, their countries were dragged into World War 
II through alliances with East Europe. At present, however, 
these reminiscences are no longer very important. The large 
states of the European Union, England, France, Italy, and 
naturally Germany welcome the membership of the East European 
states. Yet the United States is maneuvering itself into a 
homemade dilemma, as some at the Brussels headquarters claim 
with malicious joy and others with concern. In the long run, 
Congress will not be able to reject additional assistance 
guarantees for Europe. NATO and the position of the United 
States as a world power would be undermined if the Europeans 
should only belong to the WEU in the future. Thus, the 
initiative would silently pass from the Atlantic parent company 
to the European branch. 
  This would even be too much for the French, who have always 
criticized the fact that the United States naturally plays the 
major role within NATO. French security policy is also aimed at 
keeping the United States in Europe. Yet the French are not 
really sorry that Washington's seeming distance vis-a-vis the 
old continent forces them once more to become active. They will 
use this opportunity and raise their voices more often on 
security issues than in the past, and they will passionately 
advocate WEU membership for the East European states. Paris 
welcomed the proposal by NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner 
to grant the WEU access to NATO infrastructure through a task 
force that is independent of the U.S. commander in chief. This 
would make it possible for the Europeans to shine on the 
security stage without the main U.S. actor, even though hoping 
for Washington's blessing. 
  While respecting France's ambition, Ruehe and Foreign 
Minister Kinkel would prefer both official and personal 
commitment on the part of the United States. They know what 
they are talking about: It was James Baker who integrated the 
reunited Germany into NATO.

<F P=106> [Editorial by "jj": "Beautiful, Mysterious Formulas"] </F>
  [Text] The debate about NATO membership for the East 
European states is as honest as all diplomacy that faces an 
insoluble dilemma, meaning that it is nothing special. One half 
of the dilemma consists of the conviction that the former 
satellites of the Soviet Union need and deserve a safe home. 
The other half is that the West cannot offer them membership in 
the alliance. 
  There are good and not so good reasons for the denial. The 
latter include consideration for Moscow's irritability, which is 
ultimately turning into a Russian right of veto over Western 
policies. The better reasons include the fear of a watered-down 
alliance and of the acceptance of states that would bring too 
many internal and external conflicts into the alliance. In 
fact, NATO has always drawn its strength from a solid foundation 
of identical interests and institutions (with the exception of 
Greece and Turkey). 
  This dilemma explains the vague rhetoric, the "beautiful, 
mysterious formulas," as the Estonian president put it. They 
include neither dates nor obligations. Still, there is a better 
way to avoid the dilemma. Clinton outlined it when he appealed 
to the West to speak more about "trade than aid." "Trade 
barriers" must be removed quickly. There is no point in 
"applauding market reforms" while only "offering selective 
access to our markets." Markets mean growth, and prosperity 
legitimizes the democratic reform policy -- probably more than 
an abstract alliance membership. Moreover, this method has the 
advantage of really helping the East Europeans without offending 
the Russians.

<F P=106> [Report by "Sche./R.O.": "CSU Threatens To Withdraw From </F>
Bonn Coalition"] 
  [Text] Kreuth -- A serious political conflict was 
developing between the sister parties, the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU] and the Christian Social Union [CSU], on 8 January. 
  The CSU no longer rules out its withdrawal from the Bonn 
coalition and its republic-wide expansion following the 1994 
Bundestag elections. Such a step would also spell an end to the 
community of the two parties in Bonn, something the CSU had 
decided before, on 19 November 1976, under its former chairman, 
Franz-Josef Strauss, and had rescinded on 12 December of the 
same year. 
  Following the three-day meeting, CSU Land Group Chairman 
Michael Glos said in Munich on 8 January that the closed CSU 
meeting in the Upper Bavarian spa of Kreuth also discussed such 
options in the event of a grand coalition in Bonn. 
  Glos called upon the CDU to demonstrate more willingness to 
fight. The larger sister party had to learn from the CSU "that 
elections can only be won in unity." He said that, being a 
realist, he advocated another coalition with the liberals 
following the 1994 Bundestag elections. This would, however, 
not be a "love match," but a deliberate marriage in which the 
accounts "match." 
  An internal strategy paper of the land group chairman that 
WELT AM SONNTAG has obtained shows that the CSU considers the 
CDU situation to be "alarming." The sister party seems to be 
"torn by inner conflicts." The CSU is above all anticipating 
"with concern" the results for the CDU in the first Landtag 
elections this year, in Lower Saxony on 13 March. The party 
will "greatly suffer" from the fact that the attacks against 
former CDU/CSU presidential candidate Steffen Heitmann, who has 
since meanwhile resigned from his candidacy, were above all 
conducted from Lower Saxony. 
  Following the recent differences between CSU Chief Theo 
Waigel and Bavarian CSU Minister President Edmund Stoiber, Glos 
admitted that the CSU has also made mistakes in European policy. 
For instance, the Maastricht Treaties appeared to have been 
approved too rapidly, without having first been sufficiently 
discussed with the citizens. Glos confirmed, however, that "all 
differences on crucial matters" between Waigel and Stoiber were 
settled at the closed meeting. 
  A heated dispute also broke out in the meeting on 8 January 
over the presentation of Roman Herzog, the new CDU/CSU 
presidential candidate, and on the CDU's election strategy in 
the new laender. 
  WELT AM SONNTAG learned from the Chancellor's Office that 
CDU 
Chairman Helmut Kohl was not happy with the fact that Waigel 
announced the basic agreement on Herzog as a joint candidate 
prematurely and on his own on 6 January. 
  CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze stressed: "We have 
different ideas on how to deal with such a candidacy 
appropriately." Glos rejected such criticism. "Mr. Hintze 
should look at himself first. We do not need any advice on how 
to handle such a thing," he told WELT AM SONNTAG. 
  CSU Secretary General Erwin Huber also accused the CDU of 
"serious strategic mistakes" regarding the struggle for voters 
in the new laender. Huber told WELT AM SONNTAG that the party 
"failed to challenge the Party of Democratic Socialism, the 
successor of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, as would have 
been necessary."

<F P=106> [Report by "na.": "CDU Against CSU -- Inappropriate Dealing </F>
With Presidential Candidacy"] 
  [Text] Bonn/Munich -- Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
Secretary General Peter Hintze has accused the Christian Social 
Union [CSU] of having presented Roman Herzog (CDU), the joint 
new presidential candidate, to the public rashly and by a 
unilateral action. 
  "We have different ideas of how such a candidacy should be 
dealt with appropriately," Hintze told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE 
SONNTAGSZEITUNG. The CDU did not agree with CSU Chairman Theo 
Waigel's approach, said Hintze. The CDU would only make a 
statement when the CDU leadership bodies had held their meeting 
and made a decision on 14 and 15 January. Waigel acted 
differently; he first made public statements, and subsequently 
asked the bodies, said Hintze. 
  At the closed CSU meeting in the Kreuth sap, Waigel said on 
6 
January that, following a telephone conversation with Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the CDU chairman, it was "clear who will 
be the candidate of the CDU and CSU." WELT AM SONNTAG learned 
from the Chancellor's Office on 8 January that Helmut Kohl, too, 
does not agree with Waigel's premature presentation of Herzog. 
  On 8 January, Michael Glos, CSU land group chairman in the 
Bundestag, sharply rejected Hintze's criticism. His party's 
approach had been "very appropriate," said Glos at a news 
conference in Munich. The CSU had always favored Herzog -- who 
is still president of the Federal Constitutional Court -- for 
the office of federal president (to be elected on 23 May). He 
said the CSU had only supported the former CDU/CSU candidate, 
Steffen Heitmann (CDU), in order not to "put off" the sister 
party CDU, added Glos. 
  Now that Heitmann "finally" was not available any more, the 
CSU should have the right to say "audibly and publicly whom it 
considers a qualified candidate," said Glos. 
  Glos also recommended to the CDU to "make very sure" that 
the 
candidate suggested by it has the backing of its own ranks. The 
CSU did not want to see a CDU candidate called into question by 
the party's own ranks. Owing to sharp criticism even from CDU 
politicians, Saxony Justice Minister Heitmann had withdrawn his 
candidacy as a successor to Richard von Weizsaecker on 25 
November 1993. 
  While Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed his intention to 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE to continue talking about a common 
candidate with his coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party 
[FDP], FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer stressed that his 
party would also stick to its candidate, Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher, when Roman Herzog is nominated (the candidate of 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany is North 
Rhine-Westphalian Minister President Johannes Rau). 
  According to a Wickert poll, 77.9 percent of the Germans 
consider Roman Herzog qualified as federal president.

<F P=106> [Article by Bavarian Economics and Transport Minister Otto </F>
Wiesheu: "Between Emotion and Responsibility"] 
  [Text] Hardly any other subject is fraught with as 
negative a connotation as the issue of arms exports. The term 
itself triggers emotions. We long for a peaceful world. A 
dogmatic No to arms exports and a hopeful Yes to arms conversion 
seems to be the only answer that is morally defensible. 
Unfortunately, however, this is too narrow an interpretation. 
  NATO and the Western European Union [WEU] are indispensable 
as guarantors of peace. In this respect, too, international 
responsibility for our reunited country has considerably 
increased. To equip a modern army in accordance with its tasks, 
we therefore urgently depend on our arms industry, whose 
significance influences our role within the alliance. Only 
those who contribute something can codetermine the course. 
  For foreign policy reasons, our capability as an alliance 
partner can by no means be called into question. But the 
situation does not look good because the unpredictability of our 
Foreign Trade and Payments Law has affronted our alliance 
partners often enough -- even in official government programs. 
  In addition, having an arms industry base able to cooperate 
at home is an indispensable condition for our capability as an 
alliance partner. In recent years, the German arms industry has 
had to respond to changed security policy framework conditions 
by drastically decreasing its capacities. The number of jobs in 
this sector has been reduced from approximately 280,000 in 1990 
to 180,000 now. At present, the continued existence of about 70 
percent of our arms production capacities is in jeopardy. The 
situation in all the alliance states is marked by lower national 
demand, smaller series, higher costs, and tight budgets. The 
duplication of production capacities has no future. In other 
words, we can only retain the core of our military technology, 
which is an indispensable alliance policy element, by bringing 
in international cooperation and by cooperating more closely at 
the European level. 
  This is, however, only possible if all the member states are 
bound by equal export regulations. France and Britain, for 
instance, continue to stress the necessity of their respective 
arms industry bases, which are secured by a certain export 
volume as the amount required for their own military purposes is 
relatively small. Because of the strict German export regime, 
the countries mentioned in practice increasingly reject 
industrial cooperation that involves mutual dependence. 
  Germany's special exports policy hinders our industry's 
ability to cooperate and isolates it from open communication in 
the alliance area. On this basis, a network of mutual 
dependencies cannot emerge. Such a network would be 
indispensable for real cooperation and thus for safeguarding 
German production capacities. Instead of a politically agreed 
division of labor, Germany is threatening to drop out of the 
development and production area and thus depend unilaterally on 
other countries. What is fatal about this is that, if we do not 
have our own arms industry base, we are doomed to become a 
second class alliance partner. This cannot be the goal of 
German foreign policy. 
  In order that Germany remains an indispensable partner in 
the 
development and production of weapons systems, we must oblige 
our alliance partners and must accept a real harmonization of 
export provisions at a European level without any national 
reservations. Approximately 70 percent of all arms projects can 
only be carried out in cooperation with our alliance partners. 
  However, at present even the exchange of technical drawings 
with alliance partners or partners with an equal standing is 
intolerably complicated. Technology agreements for the support 
of friendly countries are also made relative by our export laws. 
The 1991 amendment to the External Trade and Payments Law has 
created obstacles, particularly in the area of dual use goods 
that can be used for civilian and military purposes, which have 
essentially caused the current problems of the entire German 
engineering sector. Common lists of countries and goods would 
be a first step in the right direction, but cannot replace a 
common licensing policy. To prevent misunderstandings -- what I 
have in mind is not a relaxation of export regulations. Rather 
I am considering a European arms policy with common regulations 
and common control provisions on the basis of a common foreign 
and security policy. 
  This is the only way to create the common European arms 
technology market that we need to retain an efficient industrial 
base in Germany with firms that remain able to cooperate and to 
make their contribution to the system. To this end, it is 
necessary to integrate weapons products into the European Union 
single market. 
  Such aspirations in no way mean that arms conversion would 
be 
given up. On the contrary, the firms must continue to pursue 
this course energetically. However, the hopes staked on it in 
the past have not materialized. The road to it is long and more 
difficult than expected. To pursue it successfully the firms as 
a whole will need the framework conditions to ensure an 
efficient core. 
  The German special policy on export issues has not only 
harmed our coordinating ability, but has in recent years also 
cost German industry many billions of marks' worth of civilian 
follow-up orders that are usually coupled with military 
procurements.

<F P=106> [Report signed "K.B.": "Unexpected Protest Against Easier </F>
Arms Exports"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 5 Jan -- Several leading members of the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU]/[CSU] 
Bundestag group have criticized foreign policy spokesman Lamers 
for his statements on arms export controls. Lamers had demanded 
the establishment of common European export rules. This would 
make arms exports easier than they are in line with the current 
German regulations. The Federal Government, too, is skeptical 
about this suggestion. So far, it has been assumed that a 
memorandum of the Foreign Policy Working Group, headlined 
"Common European Defense -- Common Arms Market -- Common Arms 
Export Policy," which was drawn up with Lamers' participation, 
meets with approval by the Bundestag group. This memorandum, 
which was published at the end of November, is now causing 
excitement with some delay. On Wednesday [5 January] deputy 
group chairman Gerster came out against loosening the German 
export rules. Before one can think of approving regulated arms 
exports along broader lines and for larger areas, one must 
emphatically counteract excessive illegal deliveries of armament 
materiel in an internationally coordinated action. CDU Deputy 
Eppelmann, the former GDR defense minister, thinks that it is 
rather necessary to tighten the arms export rules instead of 
loosening them. 
  To combat illegal arms trade, Gerster demands additional 
legal regulations. It must be possible to use evidence the 
Federal Intelligence Office [BND] has obtained from monitoring 
German arms dealers in court. Germany must not become the 
turntable for weapons from the former East Bloc. Therefore, 
checks at the borders must be tightened not only by the Customs 
Administration and the Federal Border Police, but also with the 
help of the Bundeswehr. 
  Eppelmann criticized the Lamers' proposal and the Foreign 
Policy Working Group for not aiming at solving conflicts. 
Lamers does not speak of disarmament; the working group seems 
to want to resign itself to current conditions. 
  As was confirmed on Wednesday, the Federal Government does 
not intend to follow the demand for loosening the export 
guidelines and export control regulations. However, there are 
indications of considerations to change the examination and 
licensing procedures with the final decision in the Federal 
Security Council. This is aimed at making the German armament 
industry better able to cooperate in Europe. This would be a 
reaction to complaints from the armament industry that purely 
private cooperation projects between German and European 
companies are delayed so much by the licensing procedures that 
German companies are on the brink of becoming incapable of 
cooperation. The procedures should be made equal to those for 
the smoother official cooperation projects initiated by the 
state. 
  In the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] it has been 
confirmed that it opposes any loosening of regulations both for 
arms exports as well as for civilian supplies that can be used 
for armament. SPD economic expert Schwanhold said that the 
Military Materiel Control Law and the Foreign Trade Law must 
continue to be handled strictly. The strict German rules 
should, if possible, become the standard for harmonization in 
the European Union. The goal of German policy in the new role 
of the country must be worldwide disarmament and the conversion 
of armament industries to civilian production facilities. 
Deputy SPD Chairwoman Wieczorek-Zeul said that arms exports 
cannot safeguard Germany as an industrial location. Arms 
exports would only hurt Germany's reputation in the world.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Klaus </F>
Wirtgen and Olaf Petersen in Cyprus; date not given: "When I Am 
Chancellor...."] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Scharping, you have been 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] for 
only six months and you are the youngest chairman of the postwar 
period. There are some indications that in autumn you might 
become the youngest chancellor. Does this speed not sometimes 
frighten you? 
  [Scharping] No. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is a lot of self-confidence for a 
46-year-old from the provinces in Mainz. 
  [Scharping] At 46 one is right in the middle of one's life 
-- hopefully. Should I apologize for having learned and done 
many things when I was younger? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How do you respond to the skepticism that you, 
as a foreign policy layman, are challenging the statesman Kohl? 
  [Scharping] As far as I know no one has yet been born 
chancellor. And what someone can do outside depends very much 
on what he achieves at home: in overcoming mass unemployment, 
in dealing properly with public finances, for more social 
justice or ecological modernization. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Kohl can show off his official visits. You 
are touring districts in Rhineland-Palatinate and undergoing 
training in a fitness room to get broad shoulders. 
  [Scharping] Fitness is always good. I will certainly not be 
accused by anyone of not fulfilling my office properly. This 
includes direct contacts and a precise knowledge of the inner 
workings of a country. Whoever has spent a long time on the 
stage in Bonn, removed from everything else, no longer knows 
everyday life. A chancellor should not just tour flourishing 
landscapes in the Far East but also get to know the misery in 
the east close by, in the new laender. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you not frightened by the prospect of 
becoming chancellor right in the middle of a crisis? 
  [Scharping] No question, this is a serious challenge. But 
things depend not only on one person alone but also on the 
quality of the team. I am very confident in this respect. The 
SPD will have no problems in being better in any office than the 
current government. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Whom are you going to nominate, and when are 
you going to present them? 
  [Scharping] On 22 June we will first adopt the government 
program. Then we will name the people -- mostly men and women 
who are already working on the government program. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will there be fewer ministries in a Scharping 
government? 
  [Scharping] Quite certainly. The former Ministry of Youth, 
Family, Women's Affairs, and Health has been turned into three 
ministries. I think this is superfluous. It is not absolutely 
necessary that the Ministry of Education and Science as well as 
the Ministry of Research and Technology are separate. When the 
postal reform has been completed, we will no longer need the 
respective ministry. And a Construction Ministry in which one 
official coordinates the work of three state secretaries is also 
absurd. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Under Kohl the number of parliamentary state 
secretaries rose to 26. Will you abolish these expensive 
servants of the state? 
  [Scharping] In any case, there will be clearly fewer of 
them. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The FRG is also in a political crisis: The 
trust in the people's parties is waning, there are right-wing 
extremist trends, and in the east the Party of Democratic 
Socialism, the successor of the Socialist Unity Party of 
Germany, is getting more and more followers. Do you see any 
dangers for democracy? 
  [Scharping] The stability and the ability of the democratic 
institutions to act are being affected. Major and minor 
scandals are one thing. Second, the citizens realize that 
decisive politicians -- in particular after 1989 -- do not say 
what they think and do not do what they say. And third, the 
people are right to say that many politicians' ability to expect 
their own followers to accept unpleasant truths is clearly 
lagging behind the inclination to inflict new burdens on the 
followers of the other parties. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you see a way out? 
  [Scharping] We will get out of this situation probably only 
if the citizens and those who hold responsibility in the parties 
realize that in politics, and also in everyday life, one needs a 
different mode of behavior than the one that has become usual in 
the west German distribution society: Solidarity and internal 
peace mean not only that the weak should stick together but also 
require the model of the elites. And without unemployment, the 
lack of housing, and the bitter social injustices one cannot 
explain the rising outrage and the political extremism. 
  After all, there is a great readiness to get involved. Look 
at the many citizens' initiatives. When these people no longer 
let themselves be integrated into the large parties, the trade 
unions, or the churches, this must have something to do with the 
state of affairs in these institutions. Therefore, we have 
consistently modernized the SPD, and we are also giving 
independent experts a chance. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Have you already resigned yourself to the fact 
that your party will get stuck in the 30-percent range? 
  [Scharping] No, of course not. However, one must realize 
that a high turnout and large shares in the votes by the two 
large parties were phenomena in particular of the 1970's. In 
this respect, we now have some sort of normalization, which 
naturally bothers me. Without people's parties, at least 
without the SPD, there will be no social democracy in Germany. 
However, in the meantime we have already been achieving quite 
respectable results again.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But still below 40 percent -- this is 
certainly a reason why party colleagues of yours, like 
ex-Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, are flirting with the majority 
voting system. 
  [Scharping] I am not. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Because in Mainz you are ruling together with 
the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], which would not then 
exist any more? 
  [Scharping] No, because I am convinced that our voting 
system has proved its worth. I think the parties should rather 
try to convince the citizens of the quality of their policy and 
themselves than think about how a stability that does not really 
exist can be fabricated with the help of the election system. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] It has always been one of your political 
principles not to talk about coalitions before elections. Why 
is it that you now rule out a grand coalition at the federal 
level so definitely? 
  [Scharping] Have you ever asked this question of someone 
from the Union? No one wants a grand coalition. Nor will there 
be one. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But you, like us, know that there may be an 
election result that hardly permits anything else than an 
elephants' wedding -- just as in Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
  [Scharping] Why should I worry about necessities at a time 
when I have the possibility to use every ounce of my strength to 
make sure that this does not happen. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds different. 
  [Scharping] No, I would like to repeat: There will be no 
grand coalition, before or after the elections. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your big election campaign topic -- employment 
and social justice -- was also the focus of the unsuccessful 
campaigns of Johannes Rau and Oskar Lafontaine. Why should it 
be successful this time? 
  [Scharping] In Germany we are short at least 5 million jobs, 
and, thanks to the cold policy of this Federal Government, 
social division has reached alarming proportions. I am sure 
that citizens have become much more aware of the need for a 
national employment pact than they were four or six years ago. 
We are striving for this pact: easing the burden of costs on 
labor; easing the burden on the companies so that they can 
invest, modernize, and create jobs; easing the burden on the 
social security systems constituted by tasks that are tasks for 
all of society and, therefore, must be paid for by everyone -- 
just to cite the central points. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Some proposals by the SPD Commission, which is 
working out your government program, do not sound like easing 
the burden. Thus, the Brandenburg social minister wants 
"children's cash," with every child getting 600 German marks 
[DM] per month. Can something like that be financed at all? 
  [Scharping] What must be urgently achieved is exempting the 
subsistence minimum from taxes and easing the burden on families 
with children. In this respect I agree with Regine Hildebrandt, 
but I do not agree with the instrument. Furthermore, the 
advantages of splitting taxes among spouses should have an upper 
limit. Families with children must be better off in the future. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your deputy, Wolfgang Thierse, calls for an 
equalization of burdens between east and west or a tax for the 
benefit to the east. Can the SPD win the elections in the west 
with that? 
  [Scharping] The equalization of burdens is taking place. 
More than DM150 billion is being transferred to the east every 
year. The problem is not the equalization of burdens but its 
wrong financing from loans and from contributions by working 
people. This must be changed, because reconstruction in eastern 
Germany is a common task. A debt explosion a la Waigel and the 
unilateral burdens on working people ruin both solidarity and 
solidity. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, you do not have a "pfennig for the east" 
in your government program? 
  [Scharping] We will develop the program on the basis of 
decisions made at the Wiesbaden party congress -- and they do 
not include a "pfennig for the east." 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Can you envisage anything else for the 
reconstruction in the east? 
  [Scharping] Yes. I am very much in favor of using French 
experiences: Prime Minister Balladur issued a loan. Instead of 
the planned 40 billion francs, it yielded more than 100 billion 
francs. Analogous to that, we could issue a loan for the 
reconstruction in the east, but also for large infrastructure 
investment or for a future investment program and make the 
revenue exempt from tax. 
  Balladur linked the project with the possibility to 
redistribute existing savings assets and to acquire an option on 
purchasing shares of privatization projects, such as the 
privatization of French Telecom. Now he has relegated 
privatization to the back burner. However, no one prevents us 
from making such a loan attractive and from making such an offer 
after turning German Telekom into a shareholding company. This 
also applies to other public companies. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Have industry and the banks already reacted to 
your idea? 
  [Scharping] I have talked about it with some people; such an 
activity would not be considered competition. All in all, I get 
the impression that the SPD and, in particular, its chairman get 
a better response in many internal talks with leading industry 
managers over the past four months than the Union or the 
chancellor. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Lafontaine demands that a government headed 
by the SPD also reexamines all the social services. Does this 
also mean cutbacks in unemployment benefit or sick pay? 
  [Scharping] No, we concluded this debate in connection with 
the thrift, consolidation, and growth laws. I say it quite 
clearly: When I am chancellor, we will retract the cutbacks in 
bad-weather compensation, because in winter they just lead to 
rising unemployment. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, nothing will be reduced after 
reexamination? 
  [Scharping] Many things will remain as they are; regarding 
other measures, the scope and purpose of the financing will be 
changed, and then there can be gradual corrections, for instance 
on subsidies. Specifically: We will abolish tax credits for 
children for the benefit of a unified children's allowance. We 
will introduce income-neutral promotion instruments for the 
construction of one-family and two-family houses. We will 
struggle against abuse in the tax and social system. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] When things get serious, the SPD also shies 
away. For the sake of your government power in Duesseldorf and 
Saarbruecken, you do not dare to abolish the billion-mark 
subsidies for coal in the Ruhr and the Saar. 
  [Scharping] This has nothing to do with government power but 
with industrial policy and the contribution to a certain 
independence of German energy supplies. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Imported coal is cheaper. 
  [Scharping] Giving up domestic coal for the benefit of 
imported coal would be a structural break with unpredictable 
consequences in the Ruhr area, in the Lausitz region, and in the 
Saar. Rainer Barzel once said: "When there is fire in the 
Ruhr, the waters of the Rhine will not be sufficient to 
extinguish it." The steel and coal policy is a pillar of jobs 
and social peace, that is, of Germany as an industrial location. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] After the elections in Lower-Saxony in March 
the SPD will soon be facing another test. How important is the 
presidential election on 23 May for the Bundestag elections? 
  [Scharping] At the election of the president, it will be 
decided whether the Federal Assembly follows exclusively party 
policy interests and thus decides against the will of the clear 
majority of the population. Then there will be a new debate 
about having the president elected by the people.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...which you have hitherto rejected. 
  [Scharping] Yes, but a considerable number of parliamentary 
deputies from the Union will vote for Johannes Rau. Then one 
must not forget the FDP and the three possible ballots. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] With Constitutional Court President Roman 
Herzog the Union is backing a candidate who meets with more 
approval than Steffen Heitmann. 
  [Scharping] The president of the Federal Constitutional 
Court should be more restrained in interviews. As a party 
candidate he cannot be an independent judge. If Mr. Herzog 
become the candidate of the Union, he should not exercise his 
office in Karlsruhe any more. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why has the SPD not suggested east German 
Richard Schroeder as a candidate for all parties? 
  [Scharping] This is being done for Johannes Rau. He is the 
best man for the office. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You have often and with pleasure met with the 
chancellor.... 
  [Scharping] ....it is you who say that it is with pleasure. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Could people be confused when Kohl and 
Scharping attack each other publicly in the super election year 
and then get together behind closed doors? 
  [Scharping] Kohl has once again issued an invitation for 14 
January. The topic will be the move to Berlin. As regards 
legislation, nursing-care insurance still has to be settled, in 
addition to the postal reform. My need for small talk with 
Helmut Kohl is very small. However, it is not my fault that his 
government is unable to do anything useful, not even in 
connection with combating organized crime. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Scharping, thank you for this interview.

  [Excerpt] NATO is to open its doors to East European 
countries but with caution in order not to upset Russia. The 
enlargement has been postponed but a new phase of cooperation 
starts, a sort of sweetener for the candidates. It is possible 
that in the future there will be NATO intervention without the 
Americans. Washington does not want to be involved in some of 
the complex situations such as Bosnia and leaves the decision to 
its European NATO friends. Antonio Esteves Martins reports from 
Brussels. 
  [Martins] By signing the American proposal, Partnership for 
Peace, today the 16 member states have definitively relaunched 
NATO into a new area of cooperation and have opened the door for 
new membership but only in the medium or even long term. This 
is the price to be paid in order not to irritate Russia's 
nationalists and to calm the Visegrad Four, the countries 
applying for immediate membership: Poland, Hungary, Czech 
Republic and Slovakia. 
  [Begin Cavaco recording in progress] ...a door which opens 
to 
a future enlargement. I think this will be an important 
contribution to a greater security in Europe without creating 
new divisions in Europe. The concern is not to create a new 
Iron Curtain, now situated a little further east. [passage

  [Text] President Mario Soares has taken up his New Year 
message again. Last year left a lot to be desired. The year 
was marked by an economic recession and numerous international 
conflicts. Therefore, according to Soares, it is necessary to 
fight for peace and for the value of the family. The president 
did not forget East Timor. Maria Rui reports: 
  [Rui] The year 1993 will not be missed. That is how Mario 
Soares opened his 12-page address to the diplomatic corps 
accredited in Lisbon. Soares also spoke about Timor, and of the 
wars and hunger in the world. The president did not forget the 
various crises, from the economic crisis to the one concerning 
family values. 
  [Soares] "The year 1993 will not be missed. It was a 
difficult year in which numerous conflicts emerged and 
developed, some showing a rare level of violence, in various 
continents. The year was also marked by a deep and persistent 
economic recession, which not only affected the weaker nations 
-- and how -- but also did not spare the major world pillars of 
development. Two-thirds of humanity, almost at the end of this 
millennium, unfortunately continue still subjected to the 
darkest of hungers, to epidemics and various diseases." 
  [Rui] It is necessary to fight, Mario Soares said. To fight 
against the crisis of civilization, as Pope John Paul II said to 
fight to defend the family. It is a crisis of values. It is 
also necessary to fight against the invading power of money and 
the dazzle of easy material success. It is therefore necessary 
to preserve the family. 
  [Soares] "Therefore it is necessary to encourage and dignify 
its existence without forgetting that this implies fighting 
against poverty and giving each family, particularly the 
economically weak ones, adequate living and housing conditions 
and the basic means necessary to ensure that children, who 
continue to be the world's hope, can be spared the scourge of 
marginality, violence, delinquency, malnourishment and drugs." 
  [Rui] The president's last words went to East Timor. 
Portugal continues to seek a solution to end Indonesia's 
military occupation of Timor with a view to the territory's 
self-determination.

  [Text] The Portuguese Government believes the Lajes base 
[Azores] will see its importance strengthened in the current 
world situation. [Prime Minister] Cavaco Silva told RTP in 
Brussels that Portugal advocates a new accord [with the United 
States] oriented more toward cooperation and less toward 
defense. It is possible that the quid pro quos for the use of 
the base might materialize in the shape of development programs 
for the archipelago. Antonio Esteves Martins reports: 
  [Martins] A strengthening of transatlantic ties, reaffirmed 
at this [NATO] summit, is in line with the Portuguese position. 
Because of its geographical and strategical position, Portugal 
warmly welcomes the U.S. stance. 
  [Begin recording] [Cavaco] We are very happy with President 
Clinton's declaration. It is a strong stake in cooperation with 
Europe, clearly stating that the security of the United States 
is not separate from that of Europe. It is also a commitment to 
keeping a strong U.S. presence in Europe. 
  [Martins] Strong but reduced. This means that the U.S. 
position in the old continent will henceforth be less important. 
In practice, will this strengthen the Azores' negotiating 
position on the eve on the conclusion of the accord on the Lajes 
base? 
  [Cavaco] Of course, the importance of the Azores for the 
defense of the Western world has been made clearer. But I said 
it is our contribution. The Azores are not a bargaining chip 
for us to obtain something specific for Portugal. It represents 
our clear involvement in a more secure Europe, and a more stable 
Europe. 
  [Martins] In this light, the future accord which might be 
concluded before Easter will be a cooperation and not a defense 
accord? 
  [Cavaco] A cooperation which includes defense and security 
aspects, but not exclusively. It will be more extensive. 
  [Martins] In addition, will any money emerging from this 
accord be directly invested in the development of the region? 
  [Cavaco] There is military cooperation and there are other 
forms of cooperation, such as scientific and in the education 
sector. We have entered a new phase of the transatlantic 
relationship, because do not forget that at the moment the 
European security identity is also being implemented. Thank 
you. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto by by Kaija </F>
Kervinen in Kuopio; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Finnish Government will this week discuss NATO's 
Partnership for Peace offer. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto 
was not yet able today to estimate when Finland will decide its 
stance to Partnership for Peace. 
  [Begin recording] [Haavisto] The Partnership for Peace idea 
is in itself a positive solution. It strengthens security in 
Europe, and in that sense it is in line with Finland's basic 
aims. In fact, Finland does not at present have a need for 
greater security and we do not need such a treaty in itself. 
However, it contains certain aspects, such as peacekeeping 
cooperation in which Finland would be a considerable 
contributing partner for the rest of Europe. The government 
will adopt a stance on this in due course. We will hear a more 
detailed report this afternoon on what timetable to follow when 
the decision is made on this matter, and this week the 
government's foreign affairs committee will discuss this 
situation for the first time. I cannot say when Finland's final 
decision will come. It requires very thorough familiarization 
and deliberation. 
  Regarding Vaeyrynen's stance, he is no doubt right in that 
we 
do not need such a treaty, but the government will nevertheless 
have to consider the matter as a whole from all aspects. 
  [Kervinen] Vaeyrynen is taking quite a critical view, 
perhaps 
because of these drawbacks. He says that there might be 
drawbacks from it for our neutrality. 
  [Haavisto] It is my view that this does not affect the 
neutrality one way or the other. This does not mean entering 
any military alliance, but this is only a treaty on cooperation 
in various matters and as it has been offered to all CSCE 
countries, including Russia, I feel that this does not yet have 
anything to do with neutrality, nor would this treaty endanger 
Finland's neutrality. It is then a different matter whether the 
treaty in general is a sensible thing for us, because we have 
invested more in the possibility that as member of the European 
Union, we would develop European security structures. [end

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by </F>
Andreas Unterberger: "Vranitzky Not Interested in NATO 
Partnership"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Austria does not have any direct interest 
in the Partnership for Peace (PFP), which NATO offered to 
nonmembers on Monday [10 January]. Chancellor Franz Vranitzky 
made this clear in an interview with DIE PRESSE on Monday. 
"Austria's main course is the establishment of a collective 
security system in Europe. To achieve this aim, the Maastricht 
Treaty is a much more specific tool than Partnership for Peace." 
  "If there is to be a specific offer to the European Union 
applicants, much of what the PFP could do is covered by the 
European Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE) anyhow," 
Vranitzky said. Austria already participates in individual 
areas, such as a working group for peacekeeping measures within 
the NATO Cooperation Council. As far as further PFP elements 
are concerned, such as holding joint military maneuvers, Austria 
is not interested at the moment, Vranitzky signalled. 
  He pointed out that the PFP offer is mainly being addressed 
to former Warsaw Pact countries. With this in mind, Vranitzky 
considers it very "positive." The chancellor was also pleased 
that the PFP offer involves "no disassociation from Russia." 
  At the same time, Vranitzky praised President Clinton's 
introductory speech at Brussels. "What is particularly 
important is the basic tone of his speech, saying that turning 
his back on Europe is not part of his policy." Equally 
important is Clinton's favorable comment on European 
integration, which put economic and political cooperation at the 
center. 
  Like Vranitzky, Defense Minister Fasslabend and Foreign 
Minister Mock consider the PFP "not relevant" for Austria. 
Speaking to DIE PRESSE, Fasslabend said: "Joint maneuvers are 
not an issue for us. We have already had joint exercises, such 
as the catastrophic exercise at Wiener Neustadt." The minister 
also expects in the future the United Nations will to pass 
increasingly more complex peacekeeping missions to NATO.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mirella Kalostipi from Brussels] </F>
  [Excerpt] The morning session of the NATO summit has ended 
and the heads of government and state are heading for lunch with 
Prince Albert. This morning, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
discussed NATO's new role and the Yugoslav issue. Referring to 
the Yugoslav issue, Papandreou said the dispute can only be 
settled through negotiations between the interested parties and 
that Greece, which presides over the European Union [EU], will 
spare no effort for a peaceful settlement of a dispute so near 
its border. 
  Papandreou discussed NATO's new role and stressed that its 
new duties include preventing clashes and safeguarding peace. 
He said the U.S. suggestion on cooperating for peace is the 
first step toward the alliance's expansion. 
  A declaration on Yugoslavia, the basic topic, will be issued 
tomorrow. Papandreou referred to the continuing clashes in the 
former Yugoslavia, which concern Greece deeply because they are 
a factor of instability. He said: We have condemned aggressive 
Bosnian Muslim military attacks against Croat positions in 
central Bosnia-Herzegovina, the bombing of Sarajevo by Bosnian 
Serbs, and the threat of military involvement by the Croatian 
Government in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Papandreou said: We have 
condemned the obstruction of humanitarian aid to suffering 
civilians. I am convinced that this dispute can only be settled 
through negotiations among the interested parties. He said that 
much has been achieved and that the co-chairmen contributed 
decisively to this. The prime minister stressed that it is very 
important that the parties involved immediately stop fighting 
and respect their signatures. Greece, which presides over the 
EU, will spare no effort for a peaceful settlement of a dispute 
so near its border. 
  Papandreou met twice with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who 
wished Greece a good Presidency. Clinton said he knows 
Papandreou from the United States, and added they will have many 
opportunities to meet and talk. In a pleasant atmosphere, 
Clinton told Papandreou that he watched him on television at the 
inauguration of the Greek Presidency, adding that he never 
watches himself but always watches all the other state leaders. 
Papandreou said he is certain there will be good bilateral 
cooperation. 
  In their second short meeting, Papandreou and Clinton 
referred to mutual university acquaintances in the United States 
and discussed their meeting scheduled for tomorrow and their 
upcoming meeting in the United States. 
  Papandreou met briefly with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller. Tilemakhos Khitiris, the deputy minister to the prime 
minister, said the meeting was friendly. Ciller said she saw 
lectures by the Greek prime minister in the United States. 
Papandreou congratulated her and wished her all the best during 
her term as prime minister. 
  Papandreou also met briefly with Norwegian Prime Minister 
Gro 
Harlem Brundtland. His country is a candidate for EU 
membership. The Greek prime minister said he wants to meet his 
French counterpart Edouard Balladur, a meeting that could be 
held this afternoon. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mirella Kalostipi from </F>
Brussels--live] 
  [Excerpt] Ladies and Gentlemen, good evening from Brussels. 
A short while ago Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou concluded 
his news conference following the end of the first day of the 
NATO summit. The 16 NATO leaders will shortly begin the 
traditional working dinner during which they will discuss 
details of vital problems. The prime minister said that during 
this dinner he plans to raise both the issue of Skopje and that 
of Cyprus. When asked if the issue of Cyprus was raised during 
the summit meeting thus far, since we had a proposal by Cypriot 
President Glavkos Kliridhis regarding demilitarization of 
Cyprus, Prime Minister Papandreou said that it was neither the 
appropriate time nor the proper climate to raise the issue at 
that time. Prime Minister Papandreou said that he will raise 
the Cyprus issue during the dinner that will begin shortly. 
  It is also certain that during the dinner there will be a 
discussion of the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. Responding to a 
question during the news conference on whether Greece's views 
are different from those of the United States regarding the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, Prime Minister Papandreou said that 
it is an issue that is subject to interpretation. He also said 
that there is no plan for military intervention but there is a 
warning message to the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs that the time 
limit has expired and that this tragic game must end. The prime 
minister repeated that military intervention would be a 
dangerous adventure and questioned what would happen to the 
peacekeeping forces that are already stationed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The prime minister said that every 
opportunity will be given to the opposing factions to avoid 
military intervention and added that even the issue of a gradual 
lifting of sanctions imposed should be added to this difficult 
dialogue among the involved parties. 
  At this point, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias intervened 
and added that sanctions should be lifted to help the 
peacemaking process. Papoulias said that there are new facts 
and added that it is not only the Serbs that should be blamed 
but the other involved parties, too. However, at this point we 
should stress what has been reported earlier, that in tomorrow's 
final communique on the Yugoslav problem, and specifically on 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, the 16 leaders will indeed warn 
that increased sanctions could be imposed against any side that 
supports violence and force. 
  Responding to another question regarding the Franco-German 
plan, the prime minister said that he believes the positions he 
took during the summit express a united Europe. At this point, 
Prime Minister Papandreou said that French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe will pay an official visit to Athens next month. He 
added that most allies have a certain reservation regarding the 
use of force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On the other issues, 
Papandreou described the NATO meeting as a very important one 
during which significant decisions were made. One of these 
decisions, the prime minister said, is the cooperation for 
peace, which is an attempt to accept the cooperation of 
countries that were members of the former Warsaw Pact and other 
CSCE member countries. He added that this is very important for 
Greece because this possibility includes Cyprus as well.

  [Text] French diplomacy has in a way forced the case of 
Bosnia onto the NATO summit, by asking the 15 other member 
states to think about a fresh initiative to launch the peace 
process. Laurent Boussie asked Alain Juppe, minister of foreign 
affairs, what he was hoping for specifically from this Brussels 
summit. 
  [Begin recording] [Juppe] I am hoping for three things. 
First, the alliance's support for the peace plan prepared by the 
European Union. It is the only one existing, and now we have to 
make commitments. 
  Then the reaffirmation by the alliance that it is ready to 
go 
to the area, to guarantee the application of the peace plan, if 
it is signed. 
  Third and finally, the willingness of the countries of the 
alliance to help the United Nations to get the Security Council 
resolutions respected, be it the reinforcement of ground troops, 
or the establishment of air protection when needed. 
  [Boussie] Isn't this hope a bit feeble given the dramatic 
nature of the situation? 
  [Juppe] I am well aware that any diplomatic gesture is 
insufficient today, in comparison with the terrible reality. I 
think that it can be useful, and it will enable European foreign 
ministries, in particular the French Foreign Ministry, to get 
back into contact with the parties very quickly, to tell them: 
you must stop now, or else there will be a disaster, because the 
question of maintaining the troops there in their current form 
will inevitably arise if the killings do not stop. [end

  Europe was "dying" and a collective lack of action was "the

  [Text] Greece supports the membership of Cyprus in NATO if 
the U.S. plan for gradual expansion of the North Atlantic 
alliance toward the east is adopted. NATO expansion was at the 
center of discussions today, the first day of the NATO summit. 
  NATO leaders today approved a plan to establish closer 
military ties with all former communist countries in East 
Europe, including Russia. However, NATO leaders refrained from 
adopting a demand by many former East European countries to join 
NATO as equal members. The United States proposed a plan to 
gradually expand the alliance to the east. According to 
reliable Greek sources in Brussels, the Greek side is taking a 
positive approach to the U.S. plan but believes this expansion 
should include all CSCE members, in order to open the way for 
the membership of Cyprus.

Against Ciller"] 
  [Text] Brussels--The CIA is reported to have warned Turkey 
of a plan to assassinate Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who 
arrived in Brussels to attend the NATO summit in that city 
yesterday. It has been discovered that the CIA received an 
intelligence report that the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] 
planned to assassinate Ciller. It immediately informed Ankara 
and the police in Belgium about the matter. Acting on that 
information, the police in Belgium took maximum security 
measures. Meanwhile, police officials have said they have taken 
additional measures but do not believe that an attempt to kill 
Ciller is possible. 
  The source of the information received by the CIA agents, 
who 
have been working in Brussels for many days because President 
Clinton will attend the NATO summit, has not been disclosed. 
The police in Brussels called the Turkish Embassy two days 
before Ciller arrived in Belgium to tell the officials about the 
information they received on the assassination attempt. 
Ciller's arrival in Brussels was delayed for two hours in 
accordance with the additional security measures that were 
implemented. 
  The information on the assassination attempt by the PKK 
militants, who selected Belgium as a base after the PKK was 
banned in Germany and France, has created as wave of anxiety. 
The fact that the information on the assassination attempt was 
received only a week after PKK militants created incidents in 
that country has added to the state of uneasiness. Ciller 
postponed her departure from Ankara to Brussels for two hours 
yesterday. She was scheduled to leave Ankara at 1200. She 
arrived in Brussels in the evening and found herself in the 
middle of a wall of police officials. 
  The police officials said they took all the necessary 
measures to protect Ciller but added that they did not take the 
information on the assassination attempt seriously. Prime 
Minister Ciller went to the Hilton Hotel after arriving in 
Brussels. She gave statements to the BRTN and RTBF Television 
Networks in Flemish and French respectively in her hotel last 
night and received the representatives of the Turkish community 
in Belgium. She was briefed by the representatives on the 
incidents the PKK created in Belgium last week. Ciller also 
appeared on a live CNN telecast with Frank Fesno. 
  Minister of State Necmettin Cevheri will fill in for Ciller 
while she is in Brussels to attend the NATO summit. The 
circular on Cevheri assuming the prime minister's duties was 
published in the official gazette yesterday. Minister of Labor 
and Social Security Mehmet Mogultay will fill in for Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin, who has accompanied Ciller to Brussels.

  [Text] The case of German engineer Helmut Szimkus, who has 
been sentenced to death in Tehran, kept Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel busy during the April 1993 visit to Bonn by Iranian 
Deputy Parliament President Hasan Rohani. 
  According to a secret document of the Tehran Parliament that 
FOCUS has obtained, Kinkel pointed out that the execution of the 
alleged Iraqi spy would place a serious strain on German-Iranian 
relations. Bonn would be grateful if the death sentence were to 
be commuted to life imprisonment. Apart from that, one has to 
do everything to keep the topic out of the media, Kinkel 
reportedly said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "nm": "Small Consolation"] </F>
  [Text] One year and one day ago, French President 
Mitterrand's plan for a pan-European confederation met with 
little approval from the governments of Central and East Europe, 
because it was clear that it was a barely concealed rejection of 
rapid admission to the EC. These states are now to receive a 
consolation prize once more, in the form of the Partnership for 
Peace that NATO is to offer them at the summit to be held on 
Monday [10 January]. 
  The Visegrad states above all -- Poland, Slovakia, the Czech 
Republic and Hungary -- have a claim for rapid and complete 
integration into the alliance and the EU that is morally 
justified. In retrospect, the establishment of the "Solidarity" 
free trade union in Gdansk represents the first blow that shook 
the communist giant; in what was formerly Czechoslovakia, the 
"Charter 77" dissident movement developed the principles of the 
"velvet revolution" and a civic society to follow communism; and 
finally, when the barbed wire between East and West was cut in 
Hungary, the collapse of the Berlin Wall was only a question of 
time. In view of these historic services, one can understand 
why the Polish foreign minister bitterly described the NATO 
offer as worthless, as "a signpost without any information on 
directions or distances." 
  Shortly before Clinton's departure, the U.S. Government did 
at least provide some information on the direction: The 
Partnership for Freedom is a step toward the "evolutionary 
expansion" of NATO, a transitional stage. This provides little 
consolation to those states that no longer belong to the East, 
but (still) cannot join the West. Lacking firm economic and 
domestic stability, they are being kept in a debilitating 
intermediate stage and are exposed to the tumult that has seized 
Europe following the end of the Cold War. They have shaken off 
Soviet domination and must now learn that Moscow -- even if the 
West denies it -- still has a say in their affairs.

<F P=106> [Report by Jos Klaassen: "European Union's Defense Task: A </F>
Little Work on the Side"] 
  [Text] Does the "European defense identity" remain a 
stepchild of NATO, even if at present Washington is ready to 
take this "identity" a little seriously? This question is the 
only point on the agenda of the NATO summit in Brussels which 
was not thought up by the United States. 
  The main feature of the allies' summit is a new U.S. plan 
for 
Europe: Partnership for Peace [last three words in English], 
together with the Combined Joint Task Forces [last four words in 
English]. In addition the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 
will be discussed. 
  At NATO people are not being hard with Europe. "Of course 
the European Union and its own security and defense policies 
will be applauded in the final communique. A small sentence or 
so," a NATO official says. 
  European security remains primarily a NATO matter. In this 
field the European Union and its "military arm," the Western 
European Union (WEU), can do a bit of work on the side. The 
United States -- them again! -- have even thought up a term to 
express this: separable, but not separate [four last words in 
English]. Which means that of course Europe can undertake the 
odd peace operation without the Americans, but not without their 
permission. 
  At present Manfred Woerner, NATO secretary-general, is 
maintaining excellent contacts with Wim van Eekelen, the 
secretary-general of the WEU. Woerner values the cooperation, 
but he never neglects any opportunity to emphasize that without 
NATO, Europe can kiss goodbye to its security. 
  "NATO is irreplaceable," Woerner says. "It must be clear 
that the alliance is the central body where the decisions on the 
security of the NATO member states are taken." Van Eekelen is 
certainly not in a position to say something along the same 
lines. The WEU, the alliance's European pillar, is still in its 
infancy. 
  Nothing has changed since the Cold War. Now, as in the past, 
the United States continues to set the tone in Europe when 
European security is involved -- in the past with glittering 
brochures about the dangers of Soviet Military Power [last three 
words in English], nowadays with ideas calling for not entering 
into conflict with the Russians, please. 
  Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia as members 
of NATO? Rather not. The Russians are against that. As the 
West acknowledges in reality, they have a veto on this question, 
although some hesitations can be heard in NATO circles since the 
electoral triumph of the Russian right-wing radical Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky. 
  At the NATO summit at the start of next week, to be chaired 
by President Clinton, Europe will not shine with ideas 
emphasizing the alliance's European pillar. "NATO is and 
remains the foundation of our security. It is the only alliance 
with functioning command and military structures. It is the 
guarantee of peace and stability in Europe," Volker Ruehe, the 
German defense minister, writes in the latest issue of NATO 
REVIEW. He says that the Americans have the key role in 
Europe's future. 
  In the U.S. plan for Europe, the `European defense identity' 
is best expressed in the Combined Joint Task Forces. France is 
also showing a great interest in this plan. At stake is the new 
task which NATO set itself in Rome in 1991: a peace task, 
including activities outside the alliance's treaty area. 
  On 14 December 1993 Manfred Woerner used it to tempt the 
French back into NATO's consultative structure, which is 
something very different from the integrated, U.S.-controlled 
command structure which France left in 1964. These joint 
military actions, Woerner explained, could best be carried out 
under the WEU's banner. 
  "This concept," Woerner said, "greatly facilitates France's 
participation in military actions carried out by the alliance." 
And, according to Woerner, the `joint action' is the proof that 
the United States accepts a European defense identity. His 
words did not fall on deaf ears -- in Paris. 
  The wishes of the WEU are not to be discussed at the NATO 
summit. Ideas on the WEU's role are developed in the European 
Union, rather than in NATO's Brussels headquarters. Internally 
the WEU is busy developing European security policies, but it is 
unclear how they will fit in with the policies of the top boss, 
NATO. WEU Secretary-General Van Eekelen says that three areas 
deserve attention. 
  In the first place the WEU has formed a Forum for 
Consultation for political dialogue between the WEU states and 
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to 
develop mechanisms for consultations on crisis situations. 
Conflicts could be prevented this way. The WEU also wants 
joint exercises with the East Europeans. The French proposal to 
associate Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and perhaps 
Slovakia with the WEU is well received by Van Eekelen. 
  Secondly, in reality the WEU is already involved in peace 
operations: The sea blockade of Serbia and Montenegro in the 
Adriatic Sea and monitoring the embargo against Serbia on the 
Danube. In these cases the WEU is helping NATO. The WEU still 
does not have the resources and structures necessary for an 
independent intervention. 
  Finally the WEU wants to strengthen European defense 
cooperation. The French-German-Belgian Eurocorps is providing 
the first troops. But in military and technological respects, 
the WEU is far behind the United States. A European Armament 
Agency announced in the Maastricht Treaty is intended to be the 
start of a catching-up operation. But it is doubtful whether 
the firm political will necessary is present in Europe. 
  It looks as if the WEU does not have the strength to play a 
real role in the new U.S. plan for Europe, which the Western 
allies will accept in the coming days under the leadership of 
Bill Clinton. For the time being, the European defense identity 
will remain a pious footnote.

  [Text] Frankfurt, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The European Monetary 
Institute held its first meeting Tuesday afternoon [11 January] 
in Frankfurt on what is expected to be a rocky journey to 
creation of a European central bank, with an initial team of 30 
banking pioneers. 
  At a news conference after the meeting, institute president 
Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium emphasizerd the breadth of the 
task awaiting his small team. And he said that the EMI status, 
resulting from the European Community's Maastricht Treaty, does 
not facilitate the new agency's task, as it is too "ambiguous." 
  The main difficulty lies in the fact that control of 
monetary 
policies remains in the national central banks' hands, he 
commented. But over time, the institute is to work out the 
technical procedures for putting the European Community's 
planned single currency into effect and prepare for installation 
of the future European Central Bank, he noted. 
  One of the key tasks given to the institute under the 
Maastricht treaty for European economic and monetary union (EMU) 
is preparation of banknotes denominated in ECUs [European 
Currency Unit]. 
  The institute also has authority to make recommendations, 
but 
not give instructions, to members of the European Community on 
monetary policy, exchange policy and associated matters. 
  The institute is expected to tighten cooperation among EC 
central banks and coordinate monetary policies. But it has no 
monetary powers, and in December, German secretary of state for 
finance Gerd Haller said that the German Government would not 
tolerate any action which exceeded the institute's powers. 
  Responsibility for monetary policy remains in the member 
states' hands during the second phase of EMU, as Bundesbank 
chief Hans Tietmeyer has emphasized many times, and he has also 
said that "entering the third phase is unlikely at the end of 
1996." 
  Last week the French Government gave the Bank of France 
independence in setting monetary policy but stressed that the 
government remained responsible for exchange rate policy and the 
franc's exchange rate, and that the central bank had to take 
account of overall economic policy. 
  The forced exit of sterling and the lira from the European 
Monetary System (EMS) in September 1992 and the European 
monetary crisis of last July, leading to a vast widening of the 
EMS currency fluctuation margins, were a serious blow to the 
credibility of the Maastricht monetary programme. 
  The EMI, the forerunner of a fully-independent European 
central bank, is part of a complex framework of measures to 
force national economies within the European Community to 
converge to enable the community to adopt a common currency by 
2000. 
  Actually, no Community member now meets the criteria laid 
down in the Maastricht Treaty for entering the third phase of 
EMU. 
  A big institute asset is Lamfalussy, previously managing 
director of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. He 
is universally praised for his serious approach, knowledge of 
monetary questions, and feeling for diplomacy. 
  Thanks to his "neutral" position, he might act as arbitrator 
in conflicts sure to arise in installing the single currency, or 
before a possible devaluation of an EMS currency, banking 
sources say.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Klaus-Peter Schmid: "Divided and Yet </F>
United--European Monetary Union: With the New Year the Second 
Phase Begins, but Many Points of Contention Are Still 
Unresolved"] 
  [Text] The beginning of the new year is a great hour for 
Frankfurt, because beginning 1 January 1994 a new institution 
for which many countries exerted themselves will have its 
headquarters in the financial metropolis on the Main: the 
European Monetary Institute (EMI). It is the preliminary stage 
for a future European Central Bank, the heart and brain of the 
European currency planned for the turn of the century at the 
latest. It is clear that the money gurus in Manhattan are 
counting on a substantial lift for their business from the 
presence of the European institution. 
  Initially, however, it is a matter of anything but 
transactions in finance or currency markets. Members of the EMI 
are the central banks of the 12 countries of the European Union 
[EU]. So the EMI is above all an agency whose top objective will 
be "to strengthen cooperation between the national central 
banks" and "to strengthen the coordination of the monetary 
policies of the member states with the goal of maintaining price 
stability." So states the Maastricht Treaty, which sets forth 
the stages for the European Monetary Union [EMU] and thus for a 
common European currency. 
  What appears to be pure bureaucratic work is actually 
political dynamite. How, for example, can one coordinate the 
monetary policies of 12 countries if one can only give 
recommendations rather than instructions? The answer is clear 
for the Bundesbank: the competence of the national banks of 
issue remains untouched and consequently the EMI can at best 
serve to "strengthen the process of coordinating monetary policy 
between the issuing banks of the member states." 
  That is not enough for other countries. They are already 
calling for development of the position of the EMI in such a way 
that no one can get around its decisions. More than before, the 
ulterior motive is to limit the dominant role of the mark in 
Europe's currency markets. Precisely in accordance with the 
experience of the last two years, in which the partners 
complained about the "dictates of the mark," they would like to 
restrict the freedom of movement of the Bundesbank. But the 
German central bank stresses: "The responsibility for monetary 
policy in the transition phase remains at the national level." 
  Many countries are also lured by the fact that the EMI is 
permitted to accept gold and currency reserves from the national 
central banks and to manage them. It is above all the have-nots 
who are already casting longing glances at the treasures of the 
Bundesbank and would prefer to see the largest possible share of 
the national reserves combined even now. The joint fund could be 
used, for example, to prop up weak currencies. It is no wonder 
that this idea is also disliked by the guardians of the currency 
in Frankfurt. 
  A third function of the EMI should give no reason for 
bickering: the practical preparation of the common currency. 
This ranges from the harmonizing of the clearing systems and 
statistics to the question of how a future European Central Bank 
can function and what its political instruments ought to look 
like. Two themes about which the specialists of the EMI will 
have to rack their brains may well be especially interesting: 
What are the common banknotes to look like and how are they to 
be exchanged most appropriately for the national currencies 
valid until that time? 
  Even if every member state will initially retain its central 
bank, the Maastricht Treaty prescribes a decisive change for the 
second phase of the monetary union: all national monetary 
institutes are to be given their independence and hence may no 
longer take instructions from the government. That has long been 
the case in Germany and the Netherlands. Other countries such as 
France and Belgium took this step in the past year. In this way, 
politicians can no longer directly influence monetary policy and 
above all interest rates. 
  Some governments are therefore tempted to delay this step, 
for it obstructs an unlimited source of financing. Thus, it has 
heretofore been customary in Italy or Greece for the state to 
finance its large budget deficits through the central bank and 
hence the printing press. But this inflationary abuse was 
expressly forbidden in Maastricht. The rules are so strict that 
henceforth the Bundesbank was not even allowed to give cash 
credits to the Federal Government and laender, although the 
Bundesbank Law expressly provided for this possibility. 
  A curious thing about the EMI is that its end is already 
planned but it remains uncertain when its hour will come. As 
soon as the third phase of the monetary union begins, the EMI 
will become the European Central Bank. At that time, the 
autonomy of the central banks will end in those countries that 
are giving up their national currency and bringing them into the 
uniform European currency. That will happen on 1 January 1997 at 
the earliest and two years after this date at the latest. 
  At least in principle. For no one knows what the Maastricht 
agreement is really worth. Scarcely any country in Europe 
presently fulfills the criteria, without which there can be no 
participation in the common currency. The disorder in the 
currency markets is still too great to permit a responsible 
final fixing of the exchange rates. And the crisis is still such 
a burden on the European economy that for years to come it will 
probably not be possible to fulfill the starting conditions. 
  But anyone who believes that there is no longer any interest 
in the monetary union must think again. Just a few days before 
the start of the second phase, a dispute arose that is hard to 
understand. Spain, Greece, and Portugal do not want the four 
countries that are presently negotiating on joining the EU to be 
allowed to participate in the decision on the beginning of the 
third phase. The candidates Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland 
bring with them relatively stable currencies and are therefore 
serious candidates for the European currency. Obviously the 
"Club Med countries" see their hopes disappearing that the 
strict criteria for joining could be relaxed at the decisive 
moment, allowing them to come into the circle of the chosen 
through the back door. 
  In any case, this week the 64-year-old Belgian banker 
Alexandre Lamfalussy will begin his job as first president of 
the EMI. Heretofore he was chief of the Bank for International 
Settlements (BIZ) in Basel and his appointment was applauded 
everywhere. There is only one thing to mar his start in the new 
post: the EMI Secretariat has not yet been able to find a 
suitable house in Frankfurt. They are still looking into this on 
the Main. 
  So for the time being Europe's currency popes will continue 
to meet in the futuristic tower of the BIZ at the bend of the 
Rhine in Basel. Of course they will be coming to the metropolis 
on the Main for the first meeting on 11 January, where in the 
Frankfurt town hall they will elect one of the 12 central bank 
chiefs as vice president of the EMI. After that the EMI team 
will once again withdraw to Switzerland. They will not move 
until the fall.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Klaus-Peter Schmid: "The Last Becomes the </F>
First"] 
  [Text] Athens--The Athenians had waited longingly for the 
rain. Dust was everywhere. Smog made it hard to breathe. Then, 
after almost half a year of drought, the Attic sky opened up for 
three days in November. The floods destroyed houses, swept away 
cars, and put the streets under water. "We are not prepared for 
something like this," was the excuse that one Athenian gave. 
  Many think that this is similar to the rain of money from 
Brussels: for years huge sums have been flowing to Europe's 
poorest member country but it has not really helped. About 6 
percent of the Greek national product comes from the budget of 
the European Union [EU]. That is equal to approximately half of 
all Greek tax receipts. Every year Brussels pays every Greek 
household the equivalent of 4,000 marks [DM], and the trend is 
rising. 
  It must have been quite a shock for the Greeks when in the 
early summer of 1992 Jacques Delors, president of the European 
Commission, reproached them for their lack of success: "Greece 
must have a voice in Europe but not just to present its 
demands." The Greeks are not catching up with their partners. 
When they joined the EC 12 years ago, they were richer than 
Portugal and now they are last. They have the lowest per capita 
income, the lowest productivity, and the highest inflation. 
Stefanos Manos, conservative minister of economics until the 
election defeat in October, already fears: "We are lagging so 
far behind that we are endangering the solidarity of our 
partners." 
  "Nonsense," others retort, "we are richer than the British, 
not to mention the Portuguese." One ought to add at least 40 
percent to the national product to reflect reality. For the 
policeman drives a taxi after his shift is over, the civil 
servant has a second job at half past three, the teacher with 
his salary of DM1,000 gives private lessons at home, and the 
craftsman refuses to write out a bill. There is illicit work and 
tax evasion in Western Europe as well but nowhere in the EU is 
the shadow economy nearly as strong. 
  Athen does not have beggars. Instead, the streets are full 
of 
large limousines. No where are there as many BMW's registered 
per capita as in Greece. Every day the traffic in the capital 
nearly comes to a standstill. 
  But behind this facade is Greece's backwardness. It is still 
often impossible for days to call abroad during office hours. 
Important highways are in a deplorable state. Private industry 
provides only 12.5 percent of the national product. The banks 
earn a lot of money but the payments system is archaic. The 
Greek is forced to pay social security contributions, doctor 
fees, and electric or telephone bills with bundles of cash. 
  For a long time, Athens handled the billions from Brussels 
as 
though it did not have to account to anyone. Here a church roof 
was patched, there a health center was opened, and somewhere 
else a superfluous congress palace was built--and for years no 
one pointed out where the money was coming from. Only lately did 
the Commission notice that its money benefited mostly the 
political friends of those governing. It was being said in 
Athens that foolish spending and the giving away of money were a 
thing of the past and that projects performed as favors no 
longer had a chance. Certainly Greece's unfavorable geography, 
its peripheral location, and the countless islands raise the 
costs of any plans for regional development. And the Greeks 
always add another argument: unfortunately one must reserve 7 
percent of the national product for military expenditures on 
account of Turkish aggression, more than in any other country in 
NATO. 
  But what has long been known in Athens and what they are 
reluctant to change: the greatest obstacle on the way to a 
modern state is the state itself. Everyone mistrusts it and 
cheats it, but they all want to be civil servants. The most 
frequent assessment of the work of the bureaucracy is that it is 
omnipresent and inefficient. That applies not only to the 
agencies but also to state enterprises and public institutions 
such as hospitals or schools. "No reasonable Greek sends his 
children to a public school," asserts an Athenian. 
  Vasso Papandreou, member of the Brussels commission until 
the 
end of 1992, points out a no less paralyzing effect: the state 
apparatus is firmly in the hands of the respective governing 
party. The socialist deputy, not related to the head of the 
government, demands: "We must first make the state independent 
of the parties. Otherwise we cannot do it." 
  But it would be the task of the century to get rid of the 
established clientele system, which also involves a good deal of 
nepotism. It is not just friends who are supported shamelessly, 
but above all one's own family is fed. When the conservative 
Premier Konstantin Mitsotakis entrusted his wife and daughter 
with government offices, the Left cried out in protest. But 
hardly was the socialist Papandreou in power when he brought his 
wife into the outer office and his son into the government. 
"Other countries will become party states before we develop in 
the opposite direction," thinks the political scientist Dimitris 
Charalambis from the University of Athens. 
  In addition, many see the Orthodox Church as hindering the 
development. In principle, it is not a state church. But 
religion and the state are closely interwoven in Greece, not 
only because almost every Greek professes Orthodoxy but also 
because it provides a good deal of national identity. 
  The church is a pillar of the state; it freely makes deals 
with the powerful. Athenian Archbishop Seraphim defended the 
colonels at the time of the military dictatorship with the same 
matter-of-factness based on the Bible as he now does the 
socialist Papandreou and the deputies. When it came to a mass 
demonstration against recognition of the former Yugoslav 
republic of Macedonia last year, the Orthodox bishops marched at 
the front of it and incited nationalistic feelings. Critics also 
find fault with the lack of reality and antimodernism of a 
clergy that is paid from the state treasury. 
  Do the Greeks know what they have in Europe? "We have a 
historical relationship with Europe," declares Thanos Lipowatz, 
"that is characterized by attraction and repulsion." The 
professor for political psychology points out Greek fears of 
losing their own identity in Europe. At the same time, however, 
the economic imperative is in effect and it appears that it more 
strongly influences public opinion. Meanwhile, everywhere in the 
country there are blue signs with the 12 golden stars indicating 
a construction project financed with money from Brussels. The 
funds for the huge construction site for the Athens subway come 
largely from the community pot. The farmers have never had it so 
good; 80 percent of agricultural produce is subsidized and the 
production of olive oil was never so profitable. It is no wonder 
that in surveys the Greeks are ahead of everyone in their 
positive attitude toward Europe. 
  The socialist deputy Papandreou also asserts: "The people 
here feel that they belong more to Europe than to the Balkans." 
But Greece does not have a common border with any other state of 
the EU. Despite its proud history, the feeling that the West 
sees it merely as an appendix of Europe hurts. It is certainly 
more than a coincidence that the friendly passer-by at the 
airport asks: "Are you staying in the country or are you flying 
to Europe?"

<F P=106> [Report by Stefan Schoeffel: "Attempt At Getting Kuessel </F>
Free"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Last week, the Interior Ministry received 
a letter demanding the release of Gottfried Kuessel, who is 
serving a prison sentence for neo-Nazi activities. 
Investigations indicate that his conviction could be the reason 
for the series of letter bomb attacks [carried out last 
December]. 
  The unidentified blackmailers threatened to poison several 
people if their demands were not met. They demanded that a 
helicopter be placed ready and waiting at a field at 
Hennersdorf, south of Vienna, at 1:00 PM on Sunday [9 January]. 
Kuessel should be brought there direct from prison and taken 
away in the helicopter. His destination was not to be released 
by the blackmailers until immediately afterwards. 
  Police met most of the blackmailers' demands. They provided 
a helicopter and they also brought someone resembling Kuessel 
along to the helicopter, which took off at 1:30 PM. Yet, there 
was no sign of the blackmailers, whereupon police broke off 
their mission.

<F P=106> [Report signed "d.n.": "Eleven Months of Alternative Service </F>
With Immediate Effect"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- A breakthrough has been achieved finally 
in the lengthy negotiations on alternative national service: 
Effective 1 January 1994, the duration of alternative national 
service will be 11 months. 
  "I think it was a victory for our country's security," 
Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend (Austrian People's Party) 
told DIE PRESSE on Tuesday evening [11 January]. Effective 1 
January 1994, the duration of alternative national service will 
be 11 months. A further extension to 12 months could come into 
force beginning 1 January 1995, if the number of applications 
for alternative service between 1 May and 31 October 1994 
exceeds 3,000. 
  The new regulation will remain in force until the end of 
1995. Unless a further regulation is agreed before the end of 
1995, both the board examining reasons of conscience and the 
eight-month period of alternative service will be reintroduced. 
This is the compromise agreed upon yesterday by Fasslabend and 
Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak (Social Democratic Party of 
Austria), after consultations with their respective party 
chairmen. Fasslabend said: "Our patience did pay off. I think 
it is important that the government has found a solution." 
Interior Minister Loeschnak said that he did not expect an 
extension to 12 months.

<F P=106> [Report by Lydia Ninz: "1993 Brought 6.8 Percent </F>
Unemployed"] 
  [Excerpt] Vienna -- The annual average unemployment figure 
jumped from 5.9 to 6.8 percent last year, thus reaching a record 
high in 39 years. There were an average of 222,000 registered 
unemployed in Austria, some 30,000 more than the year before. 
This is an increase of 15.1 percent. 
  Social Affairs Minister Josef Hesoun sees this development 
embedded in the international situation. His press spokesman 
said that Austria is "right at the bottom of the list on a 
Europe-wide basis." Calculated by OECD methods, Austria's 
unemployment rate goes down from 6.8 to 4.2 percent on paper. 
Austria's economic experts had predicted 7 percent, the 
ministry was more precise in its forecast. 
  For Hesoun, the new record unemployment figure is a "serious 
situation," which should be countered by an active labor and 
economic policy. 
  For the 1994 super election year, funds for measures to 
avoid 
unemployment were increased to a new high -- from 4.7 to 5 
billion Austrian schillings. So far, these funds were used 
mainly for retraining, various employment programs, subsidies to 
companies, and lately for job funds. All employees and 
employers of privately owned companies contribute to these. 
Unemployment contributions were increased at the beginning of 
this year. [passage omitted].

  The Minister for Women's Affairs, Johanna Dohnal, although

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Resignation of Come Viewed as </F>
Desirable or Necessary, Except by PS French-speaking Socialist 
Party"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Some political parties find it desirable 
for Deputy Prime Minister Guy Come [PS] to resign of his own 
accord; others demand dismissal. Only the PS absolutely refuses 
the possibility of resignation. The party of the 
French-speaking socialists repudiated former Minister Philippe 
Moureaux, who provided material to investigating Magistrate 
Vronique Ancia for the Agusta case. MP's from Flemish majority 
parties told DE STANDAARD they would find it difficult to vote 
no to a proposal calling for the dismissal of Come. 
  The official CVP [Christian People's Party] position is that 
any judgment on political and criminal responsibility should be 
suspended until Come has defended himself before the 
parliamentary committee on Thursday [13 January]. However, the 
CVP does want the investigations to speed up "as requested by 
investigating Magistrate Ancia." 
  The SP [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] says that the matter 
must be clarified and has "full confidence in the SP MPs and 
senators in the parliamentary committees" which are judging the 
question. Deputy Prime Minister Willy Claes, who was minister 
for economic affairs when the helicopters were purchased, did 
not attend the meeting due to the NATO summit. 
  When asked by DE STANDAARD, most CVP MPs said that in any 
event it would be best for Come to resign voluntarily. If a 
proposal was made to parliament demanding his dismissal, most of 
them would find it hard to vote against. The same answer was 
heard from numerous SP MPs. 
  The party bureau of the Flemish liberals said the three PS 
ministers mentioned in the Agusta case -- Federal Deputy Prime 
Minister Guy Come, Walloon Minister-President Guy Spitaels, and 
Walloon Regional Minister Guy Mathot -- should resign. "They no 
longer have the moral authority for their position," the party 
leadership said. "If Come does not reach that decision himself, 
then Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene must force him to resign." 
  The Volksunie [People's Union] said the PS ministers should 
resign and noted "with amazement the corrupt partners with which 
the Flemish Government parties" remain in government. The VU 
pointed to the differences in political culture which "are an 
obstacle to living together in a federal state." 
  The Vlaams Blok [Flemish Block] wondered why the blame was 
being shoved onto Come, while former Economic Affairs Minister 
Willy Claes (SP) was jointly responsible for the purchase of the 
Agusta helicopters. 
  For Agalev [Dutch-speaking Green Party], Deputy Prime 
Minister Come should resign at least temporarily. Agalev said 
it was unacceptable that "PS President Philippe Busquin is 
denying there is a problem." 
  The French-speaking liberals [PRL] said that "a situation 
should be avoided where a scandal which affects a few leading 
figures spreads to the whole political system." The PRL said 
the matter should proceed quickly, "with respect of the rights 
of the suspect." 
  The PSC [Social-Christian Party] said that "calm was 
necessary to uncover the truth."

<F P=106> [Article by Luc Demullier: "Spitaels Makes Strong </F>
Counterattack -- Agusta Case"] 
  [Text] The Senate Judicial Affairs Committee will decide 
today about lifting the parliamentary immunity of Guy Spitaels 
[Walloon Minister-President] and Guy Mathot [Walloon Regional 
Minister]. The committee met yesterday for the first time. At 
no time could the debate be labeled "calm." For example, after 
his appearance before the committee, Guy Spitaels calmly 
distributed the written defense he had submitted to the 
committee members. Committee President Roger Lallemand, who 
realized too late what Spitaels was planning, tried to stop him, 
but already journalists were leafing through the document. 
  In this detailed document, Spitaels denies all of the 
accusations Ancia made against him. He has had no meetings any 
of Agusta leaders, no responsibility for the financial 
transactions carried out by the Liege branch of the PS 
[French-speaking Socialist Party], and has not intervened to 
influence the Agusta purchase decision in a favorable sense. 
  But this is not all. In his defense, Spitaels calmly makes 
accusations against Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was 
then transportation minister, and against Deputy Prime Minister 
Claes, who was then economic affairs minister. Spitaels quotes 
a comment Georges Cywie made about Claes: "The Flemings were in 
favor of the French helicopter. Therefore we had to `buy' the 
Flemings. And therefore we `bought' Claes." End of quote. What 
is probably meant is that Claes was "bought" with the promise to 
set up a factory in Lummen as economic compensation. 
  In a second document Spitaels makes a particularly strong 
attack against investigating magistrate Ancia. VLD [Flemish 
Liberal Democrats] Committee member Leo Govaerts, who complained 
about the working methods imposed on the committee, called this 
"the fact of the day." As of now, no investigating magistrate 
will be able to draw up a case without risking the accusation 
that he has been "bought." In the second document, Spitaels 
also says his immunity simply cannot be lifted so that he could 
be questioned: "What questions would I be asked? Questions 
about discussions in the Cabinet? But these discussions are 
confidential." 
  Only today will the Judicial Affairs Committee issue its 
advice to the Senate on whether the immunity should be lifted. 
Normally such advice is unanimous and the Senate follows it 
without public debate. But since the discussions in the 
committee have been made public, it is very likely that members 
of the committee will vote politically. The PS members are 
making an effort so as not to lift Spitaels' immunity. It is 
less clear what they are planning to do with Mathot, who 
received some criticism from Spitaels. 
  If the votes are divided in the committee, then a public 
debate is to follow. That would be unique in the political 
history of the country. 
  After the Senate it is up to the French Community Council 
and 
the Walloon Regional Council to vote on lifting the immunity. 
What is to happen if these three assemblies contradict one 
another? Yesterday no politician dared to consider this real 
possibility.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Francis Briquemont by </F>
Rudi Rotthier in Sarajevo; date not given: "`I Admit It, I Am 
Tired' -- Lieutenant General Briquemont on His Assignment in 
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Sarajevo -- Belgian General Briquemont has been 
commanding the UN troops in Bosnia since July 1993. "I do not 
think it is possible to be pleased about this sort of work in a 
country with bloodbaths and atrocities. On the humanitarian 
level, however, I have helped to create something extraordinary." 
<H5>  A Talk in UN Headquarters in Sarajevo. </H5>
  A few shells go off within hearing distance of the residence 
in which Lieutenant General Francis Briquemont is staying. He 
beckons to his colleague: "We have to call Milovanovic." He 
then explains to us: "If the shelling starts up, we telephone 
to try to calm things down. Sometimes that helps." It helps 
this time. For a little while, at least; you cannot expect 
anything more. 
  The lieutenant general, who in normal life is the commander 
of the 1st Corps (including the Belgian troops in Germany), is 
living these days with the failure of the laboriously achieved 
Christmas and New Year's truce. On 23 December, some 1,300 
projectiles fell on and around Sarajevo. Five were killed and 
68 were injured -- a miserable way to begin a truce. "I had 
resolved never to let any more documents be signed. They (the 
leaders of the fighting parties) never respect their signatures. 
We have signed 25, 35, or is it 40 cease-fire agreements, and 
they have never been respected. The Christmas truce was proposed 
by the Croats, and then accepted by the Bosnian, and later the 
Serb military officials. In Brussels, the political officials 
ratified it. And what was the result of all this? The fighting 
in Sarajevo over the past few days has been more intense than in 
the last five months. Something like that therefore has a 
political meaning. Since (the breakdown of) the negotiations in 
Brussels, none of the parties wants to appear weak; none of the 
parties wants anything that has been imposed. I feel this very 
strongly in the talks. In the meantime, military activity has 
again dropped somewhat." 
  [Rotthier] Relatively speaking... 
  [Briquemont] You can get used to anything, you know. When I 
came here in July, there were 3,000 shells falling every day. 
  There is always provocation in the southern part of the 
city, 
and the Serbs react -- how should I put it? -- too strongly. 
They have problems with the concept of an "appropriate reply." 
I tell them that, too. Shelling Sarajevo is stupid from the 
military point of view, and always a tragedy from the 
humanitarian point of view. 
  On the other hand, I cannot understand why there are always 
talks about Sarajevo. To me, the Croatian shellings of Mostar 
are just as questionable as the Serb shellings of Sarajevo -- or 
what the Bosnians are doing in the area around Vitez. 
  [Rotthier] Do you think that all the parties are equally 
bad? 
  [Briquemont] If you judge the situation on the basis of 
international principles of law, it is difficult to see how the 
Bosnian Government could be wrong. It is an internationally 
recognized state, so the Bosnians feel it is difficult to be 
placed on the same level as the Serbs or Croats who are 
attacking their state. I personally have always tried to 
approach the situation as it is, and not as people would like it 
to be. It is clear that, in order to reach an agreement, all 
three parties must sit down at the table. In the beginning, we 
thought in terms of a multicultural, multiethnic Bosnia with 
perhaps 10 provinces. We have now ended up with a division of 
the land, and even the Bosnian Government is now agreed that 
there must be a Muslim state alongside a Serbian state and a 
Croatian state. There has been talk of a Union of Bosnian 
States. President Izetbegovic has admitted that it is no longer 
possible to keep a central government. 
  All three parties break the truces. They tell us: "We will 
comply with them [the truces] if the others do." But there is 
always some hothead who fires off a cannon or who empties a 
machine gun. As for atrocities, these happen on all sides, but 
I have noted for some time now that the military leaders -- 
especially the Bosnian and Croat ones -- have been trying to 
bring their armies under control. In Sarajevo, we almost saw a 
purge of disobedient units. A number of corp commanders have 
been replaced. A British vehicle was hijacked in the Vitez area 
a couple of days ago. The Bosnian commander did everything 
possible to restore the vehicle to its owners. The same is true 
for the Croats. I am not saying that nobody steps over the 
line, because in this country it is difficult to keep everyone 
under control. However, the military leaders are doing what 
they can. 
  [Rotthier] But you will not sign any more agreements with 
them? 
  [Briquemont] That serves no purpose -- literally. My 
predecessor, Gen. Morillon -- and this is not a criticism -- 
clung to this in order to meet with the commanders. He hoped to 
drag the parties along and to get signed agreements. I rapidly 
became aware that meetings in front of journalists would only 
lead to posturing. People were not coming to negotiate, but to 
see the spectacle. 
  This is not directed just at journalists, but also at 
ourselves. In the beginning, the officials always came with 
three, four, or five colleagues: Not so they could negotiate 
better, but to show their own delegation that they were the boss 
and capable of imposing their will on others. After two or 
three weeks, I then decided only to negotiate with the generals 
-- as confidentially as possible. Since then, I have realized 
that it is difficult to have all three of them together. Many 
problems are better discussed with two parties, or even in a 
tete-a-tete. The negotiations are always tough, but at least 
the atmosphere is calm, and from time to time they even discuss 
the problems seriously. [Briquemont ends] 
  [Rotthier reports] The general (58) received us in a very 
modest office in the residence that used to be reserved for 
Marshal Tito. The building is currently being used as the 
UNPROFOR headquarters for Bosnia. It is from here that 
Briquemont coordinates operations, negotiations, transportation, 
and the distribution of food and other vital supplies. 
  He has a reputation for being straightforward, someone who 
pushes things through, energetic, and a committed negotiator. 
He is certainly not displeased to see us -- we are the first 
Flemish journalists to visit him in Sarajevo-- but the Bosnian 
mess is taking its toll. 
  [Briquemont] "I am tired," he said. "I will admit that. We 
had hoped to reach an agreement in August, then in October, and 
then in December. We have to start the same negotiations every 
time, and every time we run up against the same problems, the 
same breaking points. I have the feeling that it would be easier 
to reach an agreement between the military men than between the 
politicians, which is pretty amazing." 
  [Rotthier] Is that because there is a better understanding 
between military men? 
  [Briquemont] They know each other. Generals Dilic and Mladic 
(the Bosnian and Serb commanders) served in the same Army. They 
had the same training; they know each other. I recently had a 
meeting with both generals. I said something like: "So, now 
you two have spoken with each other." "That is true," said one 
of them, "Why aren't we talking." To which the other one 
replied, "And why are we fighting anyway?" That is 
extraordinary, is it not? 
  It is unbelievable to see the politician at work in Geneva 
during the negotiations. All too often they do not think of 
their own people. There are quite a few who are still covered 
in a thick layer of Communism and who manipulate the gibberish 
in all its glory. Western politicians assume the generals will 
automatically apply the agreement that the politicians sign. 
They are mistaken. It is almost funny. I was once going over a 
political agreement from Geneva with the generals. I said 
thoughtlessly: Seeing that the politicians are agreed about 
this section, then everyone here should also accept it. Gen. 
Mladic looked at me and said: "Cospodine generale, non" ["My 
dear general, no."] He later added: "What the politicians 
discuss in Geneva is their problem. They do not know anything 
about the military aspect, general. We are going to rewrite 
this section, and then they will have to carry it out." That was 
how Gen. Mladic reasoned. 
  [Rotthier] So do the generals really have an eye on the 
needs 
of the people? 
  [Briquemont] I would not dare say that. But they are 
certainly aware of the situation of their own troops. Military 
men think in terms of balances of power. The Croats realize the 
Serbs are on the sidelines watching how they fight the Muslims. 
Military men know they must not needlessly exhaust their 
troops. They know that perhaps better than the politicians do. 
Time is beginning to be of the essence. It would be very bad 
if no agreement were reached by the end of winter. We are here 
to provide humanitarian aid on site. Almost every week, someone 
dies at the steering wheel of a vehicle that is supplying aid. 
A few days ago a Belgian was brutally murdered; there is no 
other way to describe it. A few weeks ago, a French soldier was 
seriously wounded by a Bosnian sniper, while he -- get this -- 
was distributing food to the Bosnian population. Public opinion 
is becoming increasingly less acceptant of this. 
  [Rotthier] Has a perpetrator ever been found? 
  [Briquemont] No. Listen. We return aggression, since our 
political officials agree to this. It is very difficult to get 
a sniper, however. He shoots once and disappears -- in the city 
and in the woods. In the city, returning fire could have 
horrible consequences. Even their own army chiefs cannot find 
them again, because we must admit: Often, the discipline at 
lower levels is lacking. Perhaps you have already noticed this 
at a checkpoint. They are 18 years-old. They think they are the 
kings of their turf, and that they can threaten anyone or make 
anyone wait half an hour. The big bosses do not have much to say 
to units that, in some places, are surrounded or, in any case, 
are distant. Weapons were stolen from the British vehicle. 
Gen. Dilic said they would be recovered. Well, that is not 
the case. Those weapons were dispersed in no time. They are 
sold or kept as souvenirs. 
  We are in a nasty predicament. We came as a peacekeeping 
force. As you know, peacekeeping in a country at war is not 
very gratifying. Gen. Cot (UNPROFOR commander in chief) said 
last week: It would be easier to wage a war than do what we are 
doing now. We wear blue helmets; we ride in white vehicles. We 
are a perfect target, and can be recognized at a distance. We 
only have very light weapons. It is not easy. 
  [Rotthier] If I question people in Sarajevo, they say: What 
does UNPROFOR bring us? There has not been water for days in 
the house where we live, and there has not been electricity for 
even longer. 
  [Briquemont] Recently, I heard someone say: If my child has 
something to eat, it is thanks to UNPROFOR. I think the people 
certainly respect the work we are doing. In the beginning, 
there was an enormous misunderstanding. People thought UNPROFOR 
had come to fight the aggressor. That was not our mandate. 
  [Rotthier] No, but is it really not possible, with the 
troops 
and resources you have, to provide electricity, water, and gas 
to the city? 
  [Briquemont] Gas is a separate problem. It comes from 
Russia, and passes through Hungary and Serbia. We checked more 
than 117 km of gas pipes between Sarajevo and Zvorni (a border 
town between Bosnia and Serbia), and after a few problems 
everything was in order. I have not managed to find out where 
the real problem lies. Sometimes the pressure in the pipe is 
normal, but usually it is too low. The gas has been played 
around with, which is extremely dangerous. People "tinker 
around" with the pipes. If the pressure should return to 
normal, there will be a risk of accidents. I met with Mr. 
Kozyrev (Russian foreign minister), who told me Russia would 
continue supplying [gas], even if the Bosnians did not pay. 
This is a matter between Bosnians and Serbs. It is also a 
question of money, since the Bosnians are refusing to pay their 
bills because they suspect they would be contributing to the 
Serbs share, too. 
  As for electricity: If we get 35 megawatts, we are in good 
shape. You might be staying in a place that depends on a 
generator. In Sarajevo, there are 227 generators in all. At the 
beginning of the war, all the coolant oil was taken out of them 
because, as chance would have it, you could drive using these 
oil tanks. We now need 100 or 150 liters of oil per 
transformer. We had all the authorizations to supply this 
special oil according to a fixed quota: two-thirds for the 
Bosnians, one-third for the Serbs. But now there is another 
problem: The oil is being stolen. The police commissioner and 
I have looked for a way to protect the oil -- so far 
unsuccessfully. We should be able to add something to it so 
that it can no longer be used for cars. There is water when 
there is electricity, so electricity is the key. 
  We are now trying to repair a tram line. That would be 
something very concrete. People are tired of walking around. 
There are 20 tram cars left. 
  [Rotthier] And electricity is needed for them too? 
  [Briquemont] The snipers are a bigger problem. At a tram 
stop it would be all too easy to find some victims. We are 
thinking about painting the tram cars white and putting UN 
insignias on them. 
  Generally speaking, the situation is rather disapppointing 
for the people -- that I can understand. You must also realize, 
however, that every day the French distribute 80 to 100 tonnes 
of foodstuffs to all the population groups. Naturally, the 
ministers do not like this, because then there is nothing for 
them. I have been told that people lost an average of 15 kilos 
in weight last winter. We are once again inviting artists, who 
can eat their fill. We received a visit from an opera singer 
who probably used to look like Montserrat Caballe. When I saw 
her, she was like... 
  [Rotthier] Callas. 
  [Briquemont] Yes. Certain products are lacking. Not enough 
sugar is distributed. People crave sweets. If you offer 
someone a piece of chocolate, it looks like you are giving away 
gold. And that is not just because it is Belgian chocolate. 
  However, it is wrong to busy ourselves just with Sarajevo. 
Other parts of Bosnia are worse off: Tuzla, for example, where 
800,000 people, including many refugees, are stuck. 
  [Rotthier] UNPROFOR is bound by a mandate that says it must 
be limited, for the most part, to a humanitarian role. What 
would your ideal mandate be? 
  [Briquemont] According to me, it is not so much a problem 
of mandate. It does not please me to repeat it: There is a gap 
between the resolutions in the UN Security Council and the 
resources the military personnel receive on the ground for 
applying the mandate. That is the problem. Recently, [Belgian 
Foreign] Minister Claes invited me to Luxembourg to talk about 
the plans for a humanitarian corridor. Gen. Cot said: We need 
an extra 4,000 men for that. During a subsequent meeting, all 
possible subjects were discussed, but nothing was arranged for 
these 4,000 men. The meetings continued. People would say: We 
should have this, and we should have that. But if we asked for 
resources to carry it out, we got nothing. I am now going to 
welcome a battalion from Malaysia. We have been asked to help 
them with their equipment. I do not know if Malaysians know 
what a snowflake looks like. I pity these soldiers. They are 
coming in midwinter, when temperatures are minus 20 degrees 
celsius. What will they do? Sit around a fire hoping not to 
die of the cold. I cannot put them at the checkpoints; I cannot 
let them go on patrols. I will probably not be able to use them 
properly before spring. I do not resent them; they are doing 
what they can, but they are a strain on the troops that are 
already here, and they are going to have a tough time all winter. 
  This is an army that has been cobbled together. Each country 
has its own equipment. There are just 400 Ukrainians, which 
means they have difficulty keeping their logistics up to the 
mark. There are differences in training. There are problems 
with language. The Ukrainians speak no English or French; 
communication is achieved through an interpreter. In periods of 
crisis, this is not feasible. At such times, you must be able 
to communicate directly. 
  There are also governments that do not accept all the 
assignments. The Scandinavian battalion came under certain 
conditions: It only wants to operate in Tuzla. The Danes 
wanted to come with tanks as a matter of course. I do not want 
to go into this too much, because there is little sense for me 
to moan the entire time about what the political officials in 
charge decide; but for the first time in my career as an 
officer, a battalion commander has refused to carry out an order 
because his government did not allow it. You must realize what 
that means for an officer: refusing an order. I wanted to put 
the Scandinavians in Srebrenica temporarily, while awaiting the 
arrival of the Netherlanders. That was rejected. The Danes have 
been stuck in Belgrade for two and a half months because the 
Serbs are refusing to let their tanks through. They regard 
tanks as weapons of war, not as peacekeeping instruments. 
  Generally speaking, the problem is that we have to make 
compromises without a clear goal. As long as there is no 
military agreement, we will divide our attention between 
providing humanitarian aid, accompanying convoys, the mission on 
Mount Igman, defending not very well defined safe areas, and so 
on. I can assure you: It is not easy. 
  [Rotthier] A few months ago, reports appeared about 
irregularities within UNPROFOR: the black market, prostitution, 
drugs. How much of this is true? 
  [Briquemont] There was an inquiry. I have just read the 
results and I am somewhat reassured. There were a few 
individual deeds, which, in a couple of cases, were punished. 
In a city like this, it is hard to stop an individual from 
selling a pack of cigarettes, or to pay for a girl with a carton 
of cigarettes. I was afraid there was an organization behind 
it, but that was refuted by the inquiry. 
  [Rotthier] What about prostitution? 
  [Briquemont] Not especially. There is prostitution in all 
cities. So why not in Sarajevo, too? 
  [Rotthier] Drugs? 
  [Briquemont] Very little. The main problem is fuel. The 
black market prices are so high (700 Belgian francs per liter -- 
DE STANDAARD editor's note) that it is difficult not to find 
oneself short of a liter now and then. 
  [Rotthier] About one year ago, in an interview with DE 
MORGEN, you spoke of your concern for the future of the Belgian 
Army. How are the Belgians doing here? 
  [Briquemont] Well. Very well. However, they are involved 
in special programs: engineering and transportation. I am still 
uneasy about the future of the Belgian Army. Following the 
abolition of military service, we had to form units by going 
virtually everywhere to look for men. Some had to alter their 
function, which -- we must admit -- caused extensive 
disorganization. Because, giving you just one example, who will 
maintain the tanks if their drivers are being retrained in 
communications? We must look to find sufficient professional 
volunteers. We will also suffer Flemish-Walloon problems, about 
which we can do nothing. For a whole series of historical, 
political, social, and economic reasons, it is easier to find 
recruits in Wallonia. We used to be able to compensate by using 
militiamen, but what shall we do now? I heard one former 
general say that a professional army is not more expensive -- 
but that is nonsense. You have to offer the soldiers something, 
training, specialization. 
  Here I have come up with a whole range of ideas for 
training. 
I have discovered that everyone -- officers, even young 
noncommissioned officers -- have to display tremendous 
cool-headedness. They often find themselves alone in extremely 
difficult situations. Yesterday, a mortar exploded 10 meters 
from my vehicle. They must act. They must be capable, for 
example, of being detailed to Mount Igman, where the Serbs are 
50 meters to the left and the Bosnians are 50 meters to the 
right; and of not losing their cool if the two sides start 
shooting at each other. In conventional military situations, 
you fight for four or five days before being relieved. Here it 
never stops, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It may meet 
with resistance, but when I return to the 1st Corps, they will 
realize it is not a matter of forming a professional army on the 
basis of acquired rights such as a 38-hour work week, 
recuperation days, and so on. We must have fresh, trained men. 
A professional army will not accept simply anyone. Soldiers 
must be in good condition. That is the only way to limit 
losses. And it is the only way to be capable of handling 
situations of this kind. 
  [Rotthier] Turning to your own future, how long will you go 
on doing this? Your assignment is of no fixed duration. 
  [Briquemont] No, but fatigue plays a role. I have been here 
for six months. In principle, all assignments last for six 
months. 
  [Rotthier] Are you thinking of retiring? 
  [Briquemont] Ha! No, not at all. The defense minister and 
my superiors see what I am doing and are aware of the limits of 
what is tolerable. Anyone who becomes too tired makes wrong 
decisions. 
  [Rotthier] How do you see the future in Bosnia? Two months 
ago, in an interview with VOX [Belgian Armed Forces magazine], 
you were still conspicuously optimistic. That would now seem to 
be less the case. 
  [Briquemont] That is true. I believed an agreement would be 
forthcoming. There was a period of international consensus that 
an agreement had to be reached. I was optimistic. I am not a 
pessimist by nature. The agreement never materialized. Lord 
Owen is now maintaining once again that an agreement is not far 
beyond our reach. I have become more cautious. Never again 
will I say that I am optimistic. Should an agrement come about 
quickly after all, then that would be wonderful. 
  [Rotthier] There are signals emanating from Great Britain 
and 
France that could be taken to indicate that these countries are 
considering withdrawing their troops. Is there a chance 
UNPROFOR will withdraw from Bosnia? 
  [Briquemont] Many countries are asking themselves questions. 
That is normal. However, suddenly pulling out, even if no 
agreement is reached, would be difficult to understand. By the 
way, I too wonder whether the inhabitants of Sarajevo would 
allow us to withdraw. We are strongly criticized -- and I can 
understand that, because the people are suffering -- but we are 
nonetheless guaranteeing the civil population minimal security, 
merely by virtue of our presence. 
  Our presence makes a difference. That is what I find 
disturbing about the criticisms leveled at us. We have few 
resources, but I can say we have saved the lives of hundreds of 
people. Our soldiers realize full well what their work means. 
When I see the enthusiasm with which French Legionnaires 
distribute food...well, that is not something you expect of a 
Legionnaire. They even do puppet shows for the children. We 
receive our fulfillment from the population, which expresses its 
gratitude to us. 
  [Rotthier] Are you satisfied that you have fulfilled your 
duty? 
  [Briquemont] I do not think it is possible to be satisfied 
with this kind of work in a country ravaged by bloodbaths and 
horrors. You must bring yourself to display great modesty. I 
came here to take sides with the population. If I succeeded in 
helping to save human lives, then I would consider my assignment 
to be partly successful. I am disillusioned that we have still 
not made very much progress along the road to a peace 
settlement, but at the human level I have experienced something 
extraordinary. I have reached the conclusion that this kind of 
conflict can never be solved by violent means. I have also 
grown aware of the fact that in this kind of operation you have 
to switch off at the personal level, which is not easy for a 
general to do. You must listen, exercise patience, and be 
modest. Incidentally, I already said to my wife: "When I 
return, you will have another husband." [end Briquemont] 
  The interview is over. The general poses, rather 
uncomfortably, for the photographs. He refuses to smile. "That 
would not be appropriate," he says.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Leo Custers: "Bosnia: A Stain on the Western </F>
Alliance"] 
  [Text] Antwerp -- Although President Bill Clinton would 
have liked it otherwise, Bosnia-Herzegovina nonetheless features 
on the agenda of Monday's and Tuesday's [10-11 January] NATO 
summit in Evere. The Bosnian horror throws a stain on the 
Western alliance. On Tuesday evening, when everyone returns to 
their day-to-day affairs of state, NATO would very much like to 
project the image of a united and satisfied alliance to the 
outside world. Former Yugoslavia in general and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular have, however, revealed the 
considerable disunity which reigns within NATO, tensions which 
have gone as far as raising the question of whether NATO still 
serves any purpose. 
  After the fall of the Soviet empire, President Ronald Reagan 
declared that America had won the cold war and that the United 
States was the world's sole remaining superpower. The allies 
promptly gave Washington the honour. And waited to see how the 
"leader of the free world" would indicate the path to be 
followed. 
  People are looking for the present U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to give clear signals on his first official visit to 
Europe. The question is whether Clinton can. The American 
President's foreign policy to date has not shone out for its 
resoluteness or for having a straight line. 
  On many points, Clinton has done just the opposite of his 
election promises. During his election campaign, Clinton 
denounced George Bush's policy on Haiti, Bosnia, and human 
rights in China. But once in power, Clinton did exactly the 
same as his predecessor: the Haitian boat refugees were sent 
back just as before, the Haitian generals remain in power, and 
democratically elected President Aristide has still not been 
able to return. 
  Clinton attacked Bush hard for his conciliatory attitude 
toward China. Clinton said that, as President, he would defend 
the principle of human rights in China. The opposite is the 
case. At the recent Vancouver conference of Pacific rim 
nations, where the Chinese were the most welcome of guests, 
Clinton did not upset the Chinese with the question of human 
rights. 
  In the same way, America's handling of the North Koreans' 
unwillingness to subject their nuclear installations to 
inspection by the Vienna International Atomic Energy Agency 
shows that Clinton will back off in a tough confrontation. 
Clinton is seeking to placate North Korea with promises of 
lifting North Korea's international isolation and of economic 
aid. But Kim Il-sung has still not permitted any inspection. 
  Clinton promised a tough approach to the aggressors in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ultimately, all he was ready to do was to 
carry out humanitarian food drops and order control flights to 
see whether the Serbians were holding to the flight ban above 
Bosnia. 
  The American unwillingness to intervene actively in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is naturally not due only to Clinton. 
Indeed, the Americans must have observed with a certain amount 
of bewilderment the rivalry between the various West European 
NATO allies -- primarily between France, Germany, and Great 
Britain, each of whom was running its own separate Balkan 
policy. Under American impetus, NATO decided in August 1993 to 
bombard Serbian positions if the Serbs continued to besiege 
Sarajevo or to hinder food convoys. Clinton even suggested 
lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia in order to enable the 
Muslims to defend themselves. None of these came to anything, 
because of total French and British opposition. Clinton just 
swallowed his hard words. 
  But in any event, it is high time for the West to try to 
correct its now bankrupt policy toward former Yugoslavia. 
Whether a breakthrough will be achieved will ultimately depend 
on the "one surviving superpower."

<F P=106> [Report by Henk Aben: "Door Left Open for New NATO Members"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- NATO left open the door yesterday for 
new members, especially from Central Europe. 
  Government leaders from the Atlantic alliance signed an 
agreement on Partnership for Peace to this effect in Brussels. 
  President Clinton claimed a second success in Brussels: 
Ukraine, Russia and the United States will sign an agreement on 
Friday [14 Janurary] on the removal of all nuclear weapons from 
Ukraine. 
  Ukraine inherited the world's third largest arsenal of 
nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union: 176 
intercontinental ballistic missiles with 1,500 atomic warheads. 
  The U.S. President showed some sympathy for the NATO 
position 
that military actions in Bosnia, like air strikes against 
Serbian positions around Sarajevo, could no longer be excluded. 
"But these warnings must be more than hollow phrases. Those 
besieging Sarajevo must understand that we are serious," Clinton 
said. 
  Prime Minister Lubbers spoke in a similar vein. "If it is 
necessary, you have to do it. In our view, it is really 
necessary. It would also increase the credibility of the 
alliance." 
  It was confirmed at the NATO summit that the approval of UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali was necessary for any military 
intervention in Bosnia. 
<H3>  Still No Perspective of Concerted Action From NATO Member 
States </H3>
  Despite growing readiness among the NATO member states to 
take a tougher line in Bosnia, concerted action is still a 
distant perspective. 
  There are also no signs that Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
is giving the UN commanders in the former Yugoslavia a free hand 
to take actions. 
  In principle, the NATO member states have been in agreement 
for months about committing more soldiers to protect aid convoys 
to Sarajevo and the "safe areas" for the civilian population. 
Air strikes were also said to be a possibility to protect UN 
troops. 
  But as Foreign Minister Kooijmans indicated, NATO had to be 
ready to implement its threats. Back in August, it was declared 
that the member states would supply ground troops and air 
support. Fifty thousand soldiers were mentioned, half were 
supposed to come from the United States. 
  But so far nothing has happened, because the NATO countries 
are divided on how to put decisions into practice. However, 
Prime Minister Lubbers rejected the existence of two camps in 
NATO. French President Mitterrand is a strong supporter of 
intervention, while Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller called 
for supporting the Bosnian government and lifting the arms 
embargo against the Bosnian Muslims. 
  The British Prime Minister Major dropped his initial 
hesitations about maintaining British troops in Bosnia. "They 
will remain this winter. We will take another look in the 
spring, depending on the political situation," he said. Canada 
has the greatest reservations about a large-scale military 
intervention in Bosnia. 
  Prime Minister Lubbers still believed the presence of 
Netherlands troops was very useful, but added "the military 
experts must be listened to properly." He openly admitted that 
"peace could not be enforced with violence." "For the 
Netherlands," Lubbers said. "The most important goal remains 
offering people help on the ground, although it is difficult to 
decide which means must be used to do so." 
  In the end, peace could only be reached if the warring 
parties decided to lay down their arms, President Clinton once 
again emphasized. He clearly showed that the United States did 
not see much point in repeating in the final declaration what 
NATO has already threatened in the past -- air strikes against 
Serbian positions. 
<H5>  Safety </H5>
  The United States had been ready to carry out these attacks, 
but the European partners were against them, because the air 
strikes would have affected negatively the safety of UN soldiers 
in Bosnia who accompany UN aid convoys. 
  Now the United States no longer has any inclination to play 
a 
leading role, although Clinton made another attempt to break 
through the impasse. "At stake is not only the safety of the 
people of Sarajevo and the possibility of bringing this tragedy 
to an end, but also NATO's credibility," he said. 
  The talks in Bonn between Bosnian President Izetbegovic and 
his Croatian counterpart Tudjman seemed to be successful 
yesterday: Bosnian Muslims and Croats were said to be ready to 
respect a cease-fire in central Bosnia. It is unclear when the 
cease-fire is to take effect.

<F P=106> [By Rowan Dore and Alison Little, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F>
parliamentary staff] 
  [Text] The Government today insisted Britain will continue 
to provide support for the United Nations Bosnia relief 
operation throughout the winter, just hours after Nato adopted a 
new plan for selective air strikes against Serbs. 
  Armed Forces Minister Jeremy Hanley also said at Commons 
question time that he foresaw no role change when the new 
commander of the UN protection force, Sir Michael Rose, takes up 
the post at the end of this month. 
  Sir Michael was formerly commander of the SAS [Special Air 
Service] in the Falklands war. 
  Labour's Kate Hoey (Vauxhall) said there was a "credibility 
gap" undermining both NATO's and the UN's roles because of 
failure to "take action against Serbian aggression." 
  She demanded "immediate, selective air strikes" to get the 
airport at Tuzla reopened and a lifting of the siege of 
Sarajevo. 
  Mr Hanley said that so far British troops had escorted 1,675 
convoys carrying over 80,000 tons of aid. There had also been 
over 1,000 flights. 
  "They will continue to provide support for relief operation 
throughout the winter." 
  He added: "It is not fair to say there is a credibility gap. 
What we are doing is helping countless thousands of lives. 
Countless thousands of people are being kept alive by our 
efforts." 
  He added: "We are doing a great job and I am proud of what 
we 
are doing." 
  John Wilkinson (C Ruislip and Northwood) asked if Sir 
Michael 
would go out with any new "political instructions" from Britain 
or the UN. 
  Mr Hanley told him: "He will carry our his task superbly, he 
is a magnificent soldier. But there is no change in role 
foreseen." 
  Later Commons Leader Tony Newton, deputising for Mr Major at 
question time, set out the Nato proposals, stressing Britain's 
willingness to use air strikes if necessary. 
  Mr Newton said: "After some very fruitful meetings in 
Brussels this morning, the Prime Minister speaking there has 
made clear that we will be drawing up plans to help UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] bring in a Netherlands contingent to replace 
the Canadians in Srebrenica, and has also agreed to examine how 
Tuzla airport can be opened, with the intention that it should 
serve as a conduit for humanitarian relief. 
  "He has also made it clear that if it is necessary to use 
air 
power to achieve these objectives, then we would be willing to 
do so." 
  Tory Matthew Banks (Southport) said: "Britain, until 
recently, has been entirely right to resist premature calls for 
air strikes in the region which would have led to extreme danger 
for our troops on the ground who were sent there to police a UN 
ceasefire, not take part in guerilla warfare." 
  He urged that "Britain continues to maintain a flexible and 
responsive approach to military action in Bosnia." 
  Miss Hoey told the Government to apply Back to Basics to 
foreign policy: "Part of that should be a basic understanding 
that aggression should not be rewarded. It is crucial that the 
siege of Sarajevo is lifted and that your Government calls for 
immediate air strikes to take out the artillery which surrounds 
that city." 
  Mr Newton urged her to study full reports of agreements 
reached in Brussels today.

  [Text] NATO leaders in Brussels yesterday declared their 
determination to eliminate obstacles to United Nations 
operations in the old Yugoslav federation. In particular they 
threatened air strikes to break the strangulation of Sarajevo, 
the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and other parts of that state 
where the population is at risk. Their priorities are to open 
the large, modern airport at Tuzla for the distribution of 
humanitarian aid and to enable Danish troops to relieve a 
Canadian contingent blocked in Srebrenica. 
  The embarrassing question of Bosnia was forced on to the 
Brussels agenda by the French, who have the largest national 
contingent in former Yugoslavia. It remains to be seen whether 
yesterday's declaration will amount to anything more than a 
similar commitment made by Nato, but never implemented, more 
than five months ago. At present, the UN is devoting greater 
resources to supplying its own forces in Bosnia than to the 
purpose for which they are there: the delivery of emergency aid 
to civilians caught in the vicious struggle between Serbs, 
Croats and Muslims. The lack of political will is such that a 
lone gunman can halt an entire convoy with its armoured escort. 
Such impotence is humiliating, both for the governments which 
have contributed to the UN force and for the soldiers 
themselves. It has led General Jean Cot, the French overall 
commander, to call for reinforcements, and last week provoked 
the resignation of General Francis Briquemont, the Belgian 
commander in Bosnia. The current situation is obviously 
intolerable. There is a case for the UN to abandon its 
operations in Yugoslavia. But, if relief is to continue, then 
UN troops must be empowered to use whatever degree of force 
proves necessary to move supplies. 
  The NATO declaration merely threatens air strikes. It omits 
to mention that a tougher policy would also require 
reinforcements on the ground. If the UN is to use Tuzla 
Airport, open the road from Mostar to Sarajevo and assure access 
to the Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, it must be prepared 
not merely to make an armed demonstration, but also to protect 
areas which have been secured. The worst course would be for 
NATO, acting for the Security Council, to make a one-off gesture 
without any intention of following up. The alliance must pursue 
a coherent plan for relieving those areas most at risk from the 
fighting. 
  Fortunately, in General Cot and General Michael Rose, 
Briquemont's successor, it has two able officers who have worked 
together before. Several NATO governments, including the 
British, have talked of the possibility of withdrawing their 
forces in the spring if a settlement has not been reached. That 
option should remain open. But the immediate task is to turn a 
flagging aid operation into an effective channel for relief 
through the rest of the Bosnian winter.
