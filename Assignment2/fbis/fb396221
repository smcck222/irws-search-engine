  [Text] His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan met British 
Prime Minister John Major in London tonight for discussion on 
the Middle East and bilateral ties. The meeting at 10 Downing 
Street centered on the political climate in the Middle East and 
the need for the respect of international law. 
  His Royal Highness related the situation in the region to 
human needs and development within the framework of sovereignty 
of all states in the area. Prince Hasan and Prime Minister 
Major also discussed ideas for regional and intraregional 
economic and trade cooperation, particularly with Europe, once a 
just and comprehensive peace is established in the region. The 
meeting, which followed Mr. Major's return from the NATO summit, 
also discussed the situation in the Balkans and UN efforts to 
end the conflict as well as Jordan's contribution to 
peacekeeping and its keenness to put an end to the bloodshed 
there.

  [Text] President Bill Clinton was today urged to demand 
that the IRA stopped exiling people from Northern Ireland 
before lifting the ban on Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams 
entering the United States. 
  The Families Against Intimidation and Terror [FAIT] handed 
in 
a letter at the American Consulate in Belfast pressing the 
president to make any lifting of the ban conditional on Mr. 
Adams using his influence to stop the terrorists banishing 
people under threat of death. 
  The organisation urged Mr. Clinton to write to Mr. Adams 
"asking him to use his considerable influence with the IRA to 
have this practice stopped and the existing expulsions lifted, 
so that those living in exile may return." 
  It asked him to bring the plight of those exiled by the 
terrorists to the attention of the Senate "urging them to lift 
the ban on Mr. Adams as a matter of urgency, as soon as the 
Republican movement lift the expulsion orders on Irish men and 
women." 
  In the past year alone FAIT has dealt with 35 cases of 
forced 
expulsion involving 63 people -- 28 individuals and seven entire 
families.

<F P=106> [George Jones and Philip Johnston report: "Tories Try To End </F>
Turmoil Over Morals"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The Prime Minister returns to London 
this afternoon for talks with senior colleagues on how to 
contain the escalating crisis over his Back to Basics campaign. 
Mr Major resolutely refused to be drawn on the issue yesterday 
as his appearance at the NATO summit in Brussels was disrupted 
by the deepening controversy over the private lives and 
financial affairs of Conservative MPs and ministers. 
  Mr Major's difficulties have been compounded by the loss of 
two ministers in less than a week -- Lord Caithness, who 
resigned as minister for shipping after the apparent suicide of 
his wife, and Mr Tim Yeo, after disclosures about his 
extra-marital affair with a Tory councillor. 
  Mr David Ashby, MP for Leics NW, forcefully denied last 
night 
reports that he had left his wife and was having a homosexual 
relationship with a male friend. He admitted he had shared a 
hotel bed in France with the man, but denied the imputation 
attached to what was a longstanding friendship. He was now 
reconciled with his Italian-born wife, Sylvana. With MPs back 
at Westminster today, Government whips are anxious to curtail 
the flood of disclosure, speculation and innuendo which was in 
full spate yesterday. 
  Mr Waldegrave, Minister for Public Service, tried to play 
down what he called a "series of eccentric events" that would 
not deflect the Government from its job of running the country. 
  "There is one real, terrible tragedy in all of this, the 
death of Lady Caithness," he said on Channel 4 News. 
  "The rest of it is almost the stuff of pantomime -- the 
width 
of beds in hotels in France: we seem to have gone potty. The 
Government has better things to do than lecture people about 
private morals." At the weekend, Mr Major called for an end to 
moral "witch hunts" against Tories who had behaved foolishly in 
their personal lives and appealed for tolerance. 
  But the question of private morality has become entangled in 
his Back to Basics campaign to the annoyance of ministers and 
the despair of backbenchers who felt the Government had turned 
the corner after a difficult year. 
  In Brussels, Mr Major brushed aside questions on domestic 
events and would respond only to inquiries about the summit. Mr 
Hurd, Foreign Secretary, was equally unforthcoming when asked 
about recent scandals and whether the Tory Party was "dead on 
its feet." 
  Later this week he is expected to join other ministers 
drafted in to try to salvage Back to Basics. 
  Mr Major is intent on pressing ahead with the initiative to 
demonstrate that it applies across a wide range of policy--from 
education to law and order--and is not a new moral code for 
Government ministers or the nation. 
  But while he sought to deflect questions about Back to 
Basics 
in Brussels, the debate raged in Britain on the eve of what 
promises to be a turbulent parliamentary session for the 
Government. 
  Mr Patten, Education Secretary, said he could not remember a 
more fraught period for the party in his 14 years as an MP. 
  "I think John Major has had a peculiarly difficult seven or 
eight days," he added on LBC radio. "We all have because of 
these events crowding in about people's alleged improprieties 
here, there and everywhere--the tragic death of Lady Caithness 
on Saturday [8 January]--I can't remember any time since I have 
been in the House when it has been so difficult." 
  Lord Archer, the former Tory chairman, said the party had 
been,"blown off course" by recent events after a period when 
many had hoped its fortunes were on the mend. But he added: 
"In a few weeks' time, people will be getting down to things 
that really matter." 
  In the Cabinet, arguments continued over the extent to which 
the Back to Basics philosophy should be founded on matters of 
personal morality. 
  Mr Howard, Home Secretary, emphasised that the concept was 
about individual responsibility but "not preaching or 
hectoring". He added: "It does not involve those matters which 
are more the responsibility of the pulpit than politicians." 
  Mr Redwood, the Welsh Secretary whose strictures against 
single mothers last summer prompted Opposition criticisms, said: 
"The moral and single parent issues are important to the 
Government." 
  Backbenchers showed increasing irritation with the way the 
Back to Basics policy was unravelling and called on Mr Major to 
redefine it in a way that allowed no misunderstandings. 
  Dame Jill Knight, MP for Edgbaston and an executive member 
of 
the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said Back to Basics went 
wider than this "one rather narrow though extremely important 
aspect of responsibility." 
  Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, said: "The Government has got 
a policy about family values which I do think is sustainable 
irrespective of the fact that a number of people seem to have 
wandered off course." 
  Mr James Cran, MP for Beverley, said: "Many of us want to 
see 
the Prime Minister and his ministers really getting down and 
reducing to black and white what his vision of Back to Basics is 
meant to be."

  [Text] Bonn, Jan. 11, IRNA -- An Iranian parliamentary 
delegation led by deputy chief of the Majles Foreign Policy 
Commission, Mohammad Javad Larijani, arrived in Cologne last 
night and was welcomed by German Parliamentarian Christoph 
Matschie. 
  Head of the Foreign Policy Commission of the German 
Parliament, Hans Stercken, in a meeting with Larijani said that 
Iran and Germany would further cooperate in regional issues and 
added that Bonn attaches importance to the recent visit to 
Tehran of a team of German parliamentarians including. 
[sentence as received] 
  Stercken said his country is willing to extend supervisory 
assistance to countries keen on privatization programmes. He 
hailed the views shared by the two countries on Karabakh 
conflict as the best key to resolve the Azerbaijan-Armenian 
conflict. 
  Larijani said Iran was willing to have constructive 
cooperation with Germany during Iran's second Five-Year 
Development Plan (to start in March). Iran could be a reliable 
partner for Germany and Europe, he hoped. 
  Larijani said Iran was ready to cooperate with Germany and 
the European Union (EU) for disarmament of nuclear and chemical 
weapons of mass destruction in the entire region. The West 
alleges arms buildup in Iran, whereas the fact is, Western arms 
sale to Persian Gulf states are worth twice as much as Iran's 
oil revenues in the past year, he noted. 
  Larijani had a separate meeting with German Deputy Foreign 
Minister Dieter Kastrup, with whom he exchanged views on 
bilateral relations, peace in the Middle East, Central Asia, the 
Persian Gulf and developments in the former Soviet republics. 
Kastrup referred to expansion of Tehran-Bonn relations, and 
emphasized the important role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 
regional peace, security and stability. 
  Larijani replied that the Islamic Republic of Iran would 
continue to assist in peace and security efforts in the region 
and the West should welcome Iran's capability in this regard. 
Iran's interests lie in peaceful joint cooperation in the 
region, he said, and that the Islamic Republic was ready to 
implement a regional cooperation system in the Persian Gulf to 
provide all the international guarantees and remove suspicions 
and anxieties.

<F P=106> [Herbert Kremp commentary: "Closing Alliance Ranks"] </F>
  [Text] In his speech at Brussels city hall, Clinton 
described relations with Europe as the central element of 
American foreign policy. The statement follows a period of 
irritation with the future course of that world power, the 
United States. Is there an Asian temptation in Washington? If 
that was the case, then the President has adjusted the course: 
Washington wants to remain the leading political and military 
power in Europe. 
  That is a load off the minds of the Europeans. Following the 
euphoria that surrounded the changes in Europe and Russia's 
return to its historical course of power politics, the American 
presence is necessary to preserve balance. Having learned their 
lesson from crises, wars, and Moscow conspiracies, the West 
Europeans have paid their respects once again. NATO has also 
benefited from the situation. Against a background that has 
grown darker, the sense and purpose of the alliance seems 
brighter. One is aware once again that without it, the old 
continent will go astray. 
  For the United States, Russia is a priority. Influenced by 
his State Department adviser Talbott, Clinton is counting on the 
reformers around Yeltsin. There is a risk in that: The reform 
may fail. 
  Partnership for peace can mean many things. Whether the 
measures that have been announced are sufficient to offer 
security to the peoples of "middle Europe" remains open. They 
have conditional protection. Unconditional confidence cannot 
develop out of that. America's reaffirmed commitment to Europe 
is a ray of hope for them -- no more and no less.

  [Text] The East European states will have no choice but to 
accept NATO's Partnership for Peace offer. The summit meeting 
in Brussels was organized so carefully that all disputes over an 
eastward expansion were removed in advance. Basically, the 
alliance declared its openness, but it deliberately tried to 
keep the exact dates that countries might be accepted a mystery. 
  The evading maneuver has a temporary advantage: Russia's 
President Yeltsin can sell the Brussels result as a "success." 
If the democratic forces in Russia succeed in keeping the 
chauvinists and neoimperialists under control, the concerns of 
the Western neighboring states from the Baltic states to the 
Black Sea may vanish again. Yet the stabilization of the 
Russian democracy may depend to an even greater extent on 
economic successes. The small states in Central and East Europe 
will try to establish close political and military ties within 
the framework of the Partnership for Peace. There were voices 
on the sidelines of the summit that predicted their entry into 
the Alliance "in a few years' time." It became clear that it 
will not be possible for the Alliance to deny them membership in 
the long run if the aggressive tones from Moscow intensify. 
  By the way, it is also possible for the Eastern neighboring 
states to enter NATO in a roundabout way, that is via membership 
in the European Union and its defense alliance, the Western 
European Union [WEU]. President Mitterrand suggested completing 
the "European Treaties" that the East European countries 
concluded with the European Union by a "WEU association." 
"Poland has not perished yet." The text of the Polish national 
anthem is also valid for other countries.

<F P=106> [Eberhard Wisdorff editorial: "Consideration for Yeltsin"] </F>
  [Text] For the third time since the collapse of the East 
Bloc, the 16 heads of state and government of the NATO countries 
tried at their summit in Brussels to give clearer contours to a 
new comprehensive security structure for Europe. In mid-1990 in 
London the alliance formulated the offer for cooperation with 
the East and, a few months later, it confirmed it in the CSCE 
Charter of Paris. A year later in Rome NATO adopted its new 
strategic concept, which is adapted to the changed situation. 
Almost at the same time, the 12 member states of the 
then-European Community agreed on the treaty for the 
establishment of the European Union (EU), which envisages an 
independent foreign and security policy by using the Western 
European Union (WEU) as a complementary institution to NATO. 
  Already these few stations mark the speed of development 
following the upheavals in the East. Nevertheless, now in 
Brussels there were once again new factors, such as, above all, 
the uncertainty about the Russian reform policy, that 
characterized the debate, at the end of which it remains unclear 
what the security structures on the old continent will be like 
in the end but whose result should clarify the relationship 
between Europe and the United States and the former East Bloc at 
least for some time. 
  In shaping relations with Russia, the other CIS republics, 
as 
well as the Central East European countries, which are all 
already cooperating with NATO in the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, the alliance partners agreed to the U.S. concept of 
Partnership for Peace without any major debate. 
<H5>  Bilateral Cooperation </H5>
  It offers these countries the opportunity to introduce close 
bilateral military cooperation with NATO, for instance through 
joint maneuvers, training for peace missions, and consultations 
in the case of a threat. Accession to the alliance, which is 
demanded above all by the reform states Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, and Slovakia as well as by the Baltic countries 
after the election success of Russian rightist-nationalist 
Zhirinovskiy, is offered as a prospect, but without giving any 
specific date. 
  This is done out of consideration for Russian fears of being 
surrounded and avoids drawing a new, at least theoretical border 
in Europe. This priority set by Washington is useful certainly 
as long as there are justified hopes that the Moscow reform 
process will be continued. Furthermore, this method of action 
also corresponds to the rhythm of the EU, which has established 
links with most of these countries through an association with 
the promise of membership at a later, unspecified date. 
<H5>  The Second Pillar of the Alliance </H5>
  For the relationship between Europe and its most important 
partner on the other side of the Atlantic U.S. President Bill 
Clinton surprisingly provided a positive emphasis in Brussels by 
confirming a minimum U.S. troop presence of 100,000 men and the 
express support of the independent foreign and security policy 
development of the EU as a second pillar of the alliance. The 
indispensable security policy ties between the United States and 
Europe have been clearly affirmed. At the same time, the new 
Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Twelve can now be 
initiated more quickly after the Maastricht Treaty came into 
force with delay at the beginning of November 1993. 
  The envisaged close interlacement with the WEU, of which 
almost all EU states are members, can be intensified because of 
the readiness of the alliance to enable the WEU to use NATO 
resources for independent operations. During his visit to the 
Brussels EU Commission today the agreement on concluding the 
Uruguay round, which was achieved recently after long conflicts 
between the EU and the United States, gives Clinton the basis 
for contributing further elements to improving the Transatlantic 
climate also in the field of the economy. 
  The NATO summit gives the impression of being a further step 
in the direction toward a new security policy structure in 
Europe after the end of the Cold War. Of course, it would be 
more convincing if the partners were not still helpless in the 
face of the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia. The renewed 
affirmation of the alliance's readiness for limited air strikes 
at Serbian positions in Bosnia hardly gives rise to hope in view 
of the previous experiences.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Karl Feldmeyer: "The Adequate Decision"] </F>
  [Text] The course and the result of the NATO summit are an 
important indication of the state of the alliance. If the two 
days of meetings among heads of state and government in Brussels 
are compared with the 1991 Rome summit meeting and, a year 
earlier, the one in London, it can be seen that the Atlantic 
alliance is still the most important basis for peace and 
security in Europe. Yet, it has also become obvious that this 
is exactly why NATO is at the moment unable to come up to 
people's expectations. It disappointed the hopes of the Central 
and East European countries, which would like to join NATO, and 
has thus gone onto the defensive. 
  This has overshadowed the offer of military cooperation on 
which the heads of state and government agreed in Brussels, even 
though what NATO is offering the countries in Central and East 
Europe with the Partnership for Peace is quite something. The 
offer includes joint military exercises, seats for 
representatives of the partner states at NATO's political and 
military headquarters in Europe, staff cooperation for planning 
and implementing UN operations and crisis management, and the 
harmonization of the armed forces of the partner states on 
technology and operational procedures to facilitate cooperation 
with NATO forces in the future. Moreover, NATO has promised its 
future partners consultations when they feel threatened. 
  Hence, NATO is being serious when it expresses its intention 
to develop pan-European security structures and to include its 
former opponents in such structures. What is taking place here 
is of a different quality than irregular meetings within the UN 
framework. NATO's plan to negotiate a treaty with each partner 
state to specify the framework document that was adopted in 
Brussels according to the individual country's capabilities and 
interests offers additional opportunities to do justice to 
individual needs. 
  All that has an impact on Europe's security. That this has 
failed to get the praise desired by NATO is due to the fact that 
many governments to which this offer was directed only see it as 
a consolation prize that is unable to alleviate their 
disappointment about being unable to become NATO members in the 
foreseeable future and to remain without protection that the 
alliance's assistance obligation would offer. Their position is 
determined by the desire to protect themselves against 
imponderables and dangers that might once more emanate from 
Russia. 
  In view of these countries' experience, their position is 
understandable. However, the NATO members had very good reasons 
to turn down their request. Future developments in Russia and 
other important countries in East Europe appear uncertain. The 
risks that NATO would have incurred with the assistance 
obligation would not be calculable. Moreover, the assistance 
obligation would have to have been reinforced by the political 
will and the military capabilities to use NATO forces in faraway 
eastern areas under currently unclear framework conditions. The 
assistance obligation must not be an empty promise that would 
imperil NATO's credibility. 
  Germany would have special difficulties with such 
consequences, not only because it might involve new armament 
efforts but also because it would reestablish NATO's old 
front-line position against Moscow, and it would forfeit the 
chance to integrate Russia. This, however, would run counter to 
the interests of all the European countries. The experience 
from history is obvious: Without taking into consideration 
Russian interests and without integrating Russia into a European 
security system there can be no security, particularly for those 
states that strongly miss this security right now: Russia's 
immediate neighbors. 
  Only very rarely does one get the chance to build a security 
system that is inherently stable because it is based on an 
accommodation of interests of all the states on the continent. 
This is why this chance must not be forfeited. NATO is doing 
the right thing in trying to take advantage of the current 
favorable situation. If at all possible, Russia has to be 
integrated into the West's policy. This is what Partnership for 
Peace is seeking, because it is not only open to states that 
fear that Russia might return to its policy of hegemony, but 
even to Russia itself. Should Moscow participate in Partnership 
for Peace in the same way that it does in the NATO Cooperation 
Council, it would be a first step toward military cooperation, 
and thus to the development of an pan-European security system. 
  Not only the European countries but also the United States 
are interested in such a system. With their Partnership for 
Peace, the United States and its allies have shown that they are 
ready to take Russia's wishes and interests into account -- to 
contribute to Yeltsin's success. For European security the 
success of the democratic forces in Russia is more important 
than extending NATO eastward. Should, however, the reformers in 
Moscow fail, the next NATO summit would have to face some 
difficult decisions. Still, even then NATO would not have to 
accuse itself of forfeiting the chance to build a European 
security system together with Russia.

foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED], 
has denied having forwarded funds to Russian nationalist 
Zhirinovskiy. In an interview with STERN, Girke stated that he 
met incidentally with Zhirinovskiy in Austria shortly before 
Christmas. He also rejected the accusation concerning embezzled 
SED assets. In fact, he said, over 53 million German marks [DM] 
have been transferred to accounts held on trust. Another DM6 
million will follow shortly.

<F P=106> [Report by Andreas Foerster and Peter Kosfeld: "Girke </F>
Disappeared to Moscow?"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- Werner Girke, the owner of the former 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] company, T.V.O. 
[Fiduciary Management and Organization Company], has gone 
obviously into hiding abroad. As one investigator has confirmed 
for BERLINER ZEITUNG, there is information that Girke is in 
Moscow together with his wife. However, an arrest warrant has 
not yet been issued against the manager, who is said to have 
transferred illegally 4 million German marks [DM] to private 
accounts. 
  Meanwhile it is becoming more and more certain that Girke 
shifted major amounts of money abroad until late last year. The 
last such transfer was said to have been carried out on 30 
December 1993 to an account in Russia. 
  If that were to turn out to be correct, it virtually 
happened 
under the eyes of the German criminal authorities. As early as 
on 20 December 1993, the Independent Party Assets Commission 
filed a complaint against Girke with the office of the state 
prosecutor in Moabit on embezzlement of former SED funds. The 
complaint included extensive and conclusive documents the 
Commission encountered in the course of its research. 
Nevertheless, the state prosecutor did not even decide to take 
action even when BERLINER ZEITUNG drew attention to Girke's 
activities on Thursday [6 January] for the first time. The 
search of Girke's company and private premises took place on the 
instructions of the Independent Commission. 
  As the Trust Agency found out, Girke secretly transferred at 
least DM4 million from accounts of the SED holding companies, 
ORVAG and Corefina, to accounts of his own company. This was 
found out by the Berlin police of criminal investigations when 
they searched the T.V.O. premises. 
  "We had to work with Girke" -- this is how, on Friday, Josef 
Dierdorf, head of the Trust Agency Directorate for Special 
Assets, justified cooperation between the Breuel agency and the 
dubious entrepreneur Werner Girke. Without the T.V.O. head and 
former trustee of SED foreign assets, who has meanwhile been 
fired, bringing back the estimated DM50-60 million in SED 
foreign assets from abroad would have been hopeless from the 
very beginning. A Trust Agency spokesman vehemently rejected 
accusations that the agency started too late to take a closer 
look at the shady dealings of the import-export enterprise. 
Cooperation with Girke was intended initially "to secure as 
many assets as possible." Besides, it was not until 
mid-December that the Independent Commission began to realize 
that SED funds might have disappeared through T.V.O.

Constitutional Protection Office Investigates Russian Soldiers"] 
  [Text] The Saxony Land Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution [LfV] is investigating whether members of the 
Russian troops stationed in Germany or their relatives have any 
contacts with the party of Russian right-wing extremist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. The reason for the investigations: Saxony's 
government wants to prevent Russian followers of Zhirinovskiy 
from getting together with German neo-Nazis. 
  LfV President Mathilde Koller told BILD AM SONNTAG: "We are 
investigating whether CIS soldiers stationed in Germany have any 
contacts with Saxon neo-Nazis or whether they are producing 
propaganda among German right-wing extremists for Zhirinovskiy's 
ideas." 
  According to official information, 24 percent of the members 
of the Western Group of the former Red Army in Germany voted for 
Zhirinovskiy at the parliamentary elections. At the moment, 
there are still 31,440 soldiers and 37,730 civilians in eastern 
Germany.

<F P=106> [Report signed "Sto": "Continue To Help Russian Germans"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 10 Jan -- Mr. Waffenschmidt (Christian 
Democratic Union), the Federal Government's commissioner for 
resettlers, has said that the work for the Russian Germans is a 
great political and human task, which must also be continued in 
the future. At the same time, however, the parliamentary state 
secretary said that Russian promises regarding the step-by-step 
reestablishment of the Russian Germans' Volga Republic have not 
yet been fulfilled. Nevertheless, both the Russian Germans 
under their new chairman, Jakob Maurer, as well as the Federal 
Government stick to this goal. 
  On Monday, in Bonn, Waffenschmidt announced that there are 
still about 2 million Russian Germans in the CIS states, most of 
them in Russia. For legal, humanitarian, and political reasons, 
German activities for this ethnic groups continues to be 
necessary. The Federal Government's care goes equally to those 
who want to stay in Russia and those who move to the FRG. How 
many Russian Germans will stay in Russia and in the other CIS 
states in the end cannot be predicted reliably at the moment. 
This will depend essentially on further developments in Russia 
and, in particular, on how the Russian Germans who live there 
assess their prospects in life. Waffenschmidt expressed the 
assumption that "a considerable German ethnic group will 
probably always live in Russia." This ethnic group will be of 
great importance for the German-Russian relationship. 
  The work for the Russian Germans in Russia is "accompanied 
by 
some difficulties." These difficulties are caused by the 
quarrels between the Russian Germans and several interest 
groups, the upheavals in Russia, with a difficult distribution 
of powers, delays in the transfer of money in Germany because of 
irritations about Russian authorities, and also the 
disappointment of the Russian Germans about the current help 
that their ethnic groups receive in the Russian Federation. 
This was also the reason for the resignation of Heinrich Groth, 
the most prominent spokesman of the Russian Germans, in December 
1993. Waffenschmidt expressly stated that the direct personal 
support by President Yeltsin for the formation of the "German 
National Rayons" in western Siberia is a success. 
  Waffenschmidt was critical about the development of the 
Volga 
Republic. Here, the Russian promises have not been kept so far, 
because sympathetic feelings for Russian Germans in the area 
differ widely. However, the development in the focal area of 
"Sovkhoz 23," the settlement measure of Stepnoye, and the church 
center in Marx are exemplary.

<F P=106> [Report by Thomas Linke: "Bad Service to Customers"] </F>
  [Text] A new era should have started in the sphere of 
aviation this Monday. According to plans, on 10 January a wall 
across the Atlantic should have fallen finally and German 
Lufthansa (LH) should now be serving the Transatlantic routes 
along with its American partner, United Airlines. The LH 
passenger arriving at New York should no longer be forced to 
wait for hours for his domestic connection in America, but be 
ready to change to United Airlines aircraft that are ready to 
depart. Similarly, LH flights to New York, for example, and 
then to Seattle with United, should be operated under the same 
flight number. Through this so-called code-sharing, LH flights 
would have been regarded as direct connections and thus be 
catapulted by the software to the top of the display in computer 
reservation systems. 
<H5>  The Spurned Bride Is Slowing Things Down </H5>
  However, for the time being all that remains a vision, even 
though a breakthrough seemed so close last fall. Federal 
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann and his U.S. counterpart, 
Frederico Pena, agreed on a new aviation treaty, while shortly 
afterwards Lufthansa and United agreed on cooperation. 
Nevertheless, the treaty has not been signed formally yet. 
  The English version was accepted by Bonn in late October in 
time and sent back to Washington with comments; yet, there it is 
mainly United's competitors that are slowing things down. There 
is the spurned bride, American Airlines, which Lufthansa would 
have liked to have as its European partner. Then there is 
Delta, which, as an heir and purchaser of Pan Am's former 
European connections sees its current competitive edge dwindling. 
  Although a spokesman for the U.S. Transport Department has 
now emphasized that one has acted according to the agreement and 
is currently treating it as if it has gone into effect. 
However, so long as there are still complaints from U.S. 
carriers about the agreement and the cooperation between 
Lufthansa and United, which has not been licensed yet, 
code-sharing has to be ruled out. 
  In such a situation both sides do not hesitate to come up 
with mutual recrimination. There is the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD] opposition in Bonn, which suggests that the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] transport minister concluded an 
agreement that was not legally watertight. Still, sources in 
Bonn are blaming Lufthansa and United for the dilemma. As a 
result of its unclear ownership situation -- the work force 
wants to take over 53 percent of the stock capital -- United is 
unable currently to stand up to the other American mega-carriers 
as far as lobbying is concerned. 
  Moreover, Lufthansa was clearly slightly overeager and too 
optimistic when it announced the agreement would be implemented 
on 10 January. On the other hand, it was the Bonn government 
itself that created the impression in the fall that everything 
had been settled with the Americans. Only now does one begin to 
realize that, for example, the code-sharing rights are unclear 
as far as East Europe is concerned. And who would blame 
Lufthansa -- in the euphoria of the moment -- for releasing to 
its clients a concrete date for the coveted improvements on the 
trans-Atlantic route? 
<H5>  What Is the Position of Secretary Pena? </H5>
  Such ups and downs actually miss the essence of the problem, 
which seems to lie with the U.S. Administration. There, 
Secretary Pena obviously is far from having the same position 
his German counterpart has meanwhile acquired in Bonn. After 
all, the negotiations certainly were not made any easier by the 
fact that they involved not only the Transport Department but 
also the State Department. 
  Bonn currently is pinning its hopes on the fact that the 
Americans have to stick to the aviation agreement because they 
have enough problems of a similar nature with Japan, Holland, 
France, and England. Further talks between the two 
administrations obviously have been scheduled for the end of the 
month. Should the drumming on the American side only serve the 
purpose of getting as much out of it as possible, it would be a 
bad service to Lufthansa and United -- and, in particular, to 
their customers.

  [Text] Berlin -- A fascist group in Berlin, which calls 
itself "Weissensee Aryan Resistance" (WAW), threatens Gregor 
Gysi and all "Reds" and "asylum-seekers" with murder. 
  A threatening letter that the Weissensee district office of 
the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] received by mail on 
Monday morning [3 January], says: "Beat them to death," "beat 
the communists to death," "the time has come finally for us to 
fight back so that Germany wakes up." The letter demands that 
the building in Weissensee be cleared out by the end of January, 
"otherwise what the asylum-seekers in the Weissensee 
asylum-seekers' hostel have already experienced will occur." 
Last summer a hand grenade attack was carried out at the 
hostel. At that time, police investigated "unknown 
perpetrators." The district mayor and the police denied that 
the deed had a fascist background. 
  The PDS has filed a complaint against this group with the 
police "for threats." PDS Land Chairwoman Petra Pau stated that 
this threatening letter is the climax so far in a chain of 
attacks on PDS institutions. The "WAW" has become active in 
Berlin for the first time. At a national level a group called 
"White Aryan Resistance" is known.

  [Text] Berlin -- The Berlin-Weissensee Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS] has again received a threatening letter from the 
neo-fascist "Weissensee Aryan Resistance" ("WAW"), after it had 
found a similar pamphlet in its mailbox on Monday. The letter 
from Friday [7 January] claims that the previous letter did not 
contain a murder threat against [former PDS Chairman Gregor] 
Gysi but "only" against all those who move about freely in the 
PDS office. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution is 
greeted with the remark that it will not catch the "WAW," 
instead, "we will catch you all." Just as in the first letter, 
an ultimatum is posed to the PDS for clearing out the office by 
the end of January. In flowery words the authors glorify Hitler 
and are outraged about being called fascists -- they are, on the 
contrary, National Socialists. The PDS office has filed another 
complaint with the police, who reportedly are watching the house 
more intensively now. According to findings by the Federal 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the "WAW" is a 
group of extremely militant neo-Nazis.

  [Excerpt] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Thousands of Berliners have 
been demonstrating since this morning at the memorial of the 
socialist leaders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in 
Friedrichsfelde. The cofounders of the German Communist Party 
(KPD) were killed by volunteer corps officers in Berlin on 15 
January 1919. 
  The demonstrators are marching presently in close rows past 
the stone monument, inscribed with the words "The dead remind 
us," and past the graves and placing flowers there. One of the 
first demonstrators, despite receiving a murder threat at the 
beginning of the week, was Gregor Gysi, head of the Party of 
Democratic Socialism's [PDS] Bundestag group. He is accompanied 
by the PDS Chairman Lothar Bisky and the party's honorary 
chairman, Hans Modrow. 
  The demonstration was called by Berlin Peace Coordination, a 
loose association of leftwing parties and organizations as well 
as environmental and peace groups. Last year around 40,000 
people took part in the event. [passage omitted]

Waigel announced that he will advocate personally an initiative

integrated. The CSU chief cited industry, churches, 
universities, school children, and students, as well as 
associations, such as the VdK [Association of War-Disabled 
Persons] and the National War Graves Commission. His proposal 
"naturally met with approval" at the meeting behind closed doors

<F P=106> [Interview with European critic Manfred Brunner by Bettina </F>
Baeumlisberger, Ottmar Berbalk, and Eugen-Georg Schwarz; place 
and date not given: "The Parties Are Ripe for a Museum"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] On 23 January, you will found a new party 
in Weimar. Will you thus contribute to Weimar-like conditions 
in Germany? 
  [Brunner] We see Weimar as something positive. Weimar is 
the town of Goethe and Schiller, the town of humanism. In 
addition, Weimar is located on the territory of the former GDR. 
This is important for us. 
  [FOCUS] Weimar is also a synonym for a fragmented party 
landscape. 
  [Brunner] Of course, as a result of the shock of the Third 
Reich, one has developed a negative attitude toward the Weimar 
Republic. It perished because it was a democracy without 
democrats. In our election law, the danger of a fragmentation of 
the party landscape is prevented by the 5-percent clause. 
  [FOCUS] What will be the name of your new party? 
  [Brunner] A committee to has been established to find a 
name. We are thinking of something involving the term "citizen." 
However, whether it will be called "Federation of Free 
Citizens" or "Citizens' Ticket" or "Citizens' Movement" will be 
decided in Weimar. 
  [FOCUS] Where will be the headquarters of your party? 
  [Brunner] It must be in Berlin. I am always in favor of the 
capital city. 
  [FOCUS] Can your party become a collection pond for failed 
politicians? 
  [Brunner] No. We do not want people who want to become 
something, but people who are something. We take a very close 
look at those who come to us. For instance, on principle, we do 
not accept any former Republikaner or other former members of 
parties that are to be counted among the extreme parties. 
  [FOCUS] Which parties are these? 
  [Brunner] Quite certainly the unconstitutional Party of 
Democratic Socialism. However, whoever was a member of the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany at the time of the GDR without 
having committed any legal or moral offenses should be able to 
participate in our party from the viewpoint of national 
reconciliation. 
  [FOCUS] How far does your identification with Joerg Haider, 
chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], whom many 
consider to be a right-wing extremist, go? 
  [Brunner] We establish a party in Germany. It cannot be our 
goal to found a subsidiary of other parties. 
  Of course, Haider is not right-wing extremist. His new book 
has just received very positive reviews from NEUE ZUERCHER 
ZEITUNG, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, and WELT AM SONNTAG. For me, 
the issue of Haider is an issue involving a sense of justice and 
the refusal to submit to the rules of a leftist German taboo 
society. I have known Haider for many years and I, as a person, 
vouch for Joerg Haider, the democrat and reformer. He is a 
sensible man with interesting ideas. 
  [FOCUS] Do you think that Haider's statement about Hitler's 
employment policy can just be misinterpreted or is it incorrect? 
  [Brunner] The problem with this answer by Haider to 
instigating interjections is that it is correct and incorrect at 
the same time. It is correct, as the historians say, including 
renowned Sebastian Haffner, that the employment policy in the 
Third Reich was very successful at the beginning. Nevertheless, 
I think that this statement is incorrect as a political 
statement. I do not say about a mass murderer that he is a good 
driver, either. In making an overall judgment of a person or an 
era there are situations where individual positive aspects 
become so unimportant compared with the negative aspects that 
even mentioning them is incorrect -- not only tactically 
incorrect, but also incorrect in terms of substance. 
  [FOCUS] Do you not fear that you will be pushed into the 
right corner? 
  [Brunner] The people on our ticket are really above any 
suspicion. Of course, the keyboard of taboos will be played to 
exhaustion. Certain circles try to push everybody who is not a 
leftists into the right corner. 
  From the letters that I receive I do not conclude that the 
citizens are impressed by that. In Germany, 2,000 politicians 
are playing Monopoly with 2,000 journalists. And, for a long 
time, these 4,000 people could believe that they represent 
public opinion. This is no longer the case. 
  [FOCUS] Is this a motive of your fellow-fighters to join the 
party? 
  [Brunner] Particular in the current period there are many 
citizens who no longer see the republic as a service company and 
are against a social democratization of our society, and 
citizens who are against the European policy of the established 
parties and think that there must be a positive counterprogram 
to that. This is what we have. We are not a party that is 
against something, we are a positive party, we are for something. 
  [FOCUS] For what? 
  [Brunner] In European policy for a confederation, that is, a 
federation instead of a federal state, for democratic 
legitimation instead of a rule by councils, for an all-European 
approach instead of the West Europe of the Cold War. 
  [FOCUS] You want a Europe without a unified currency and 
also one without a common foreign, security, and economic policy? 
  [Brunner] Our Europe develops from the idea of competition 
-- political and economic competition. Everything that goes 
beyond the single market can be integrated in the community only 
if everyone agrees. Before making this decision, the national 
governments must get a binding vote by their parliaments. Let 
me give you an example: The Yugoslav crisis. The majority of 
the EC states wanted to support the old Yugoslavia and also give 
aid to the Serbs. According to the Maastricht Treaty, the 
majority would have the possibility to enforce this. I think 
this is completely unacceptable. 
  [FOCUS] Thus, you are in favor of a competition of opinions. 
What about the competition of the systems? 
  [Brunner] This refers primarily to economic systems. A 
state-economy approach in the Romance member states can 
certainly be in competition with a free-trade approach in the 
German or British-Nordic member states. However, different 
models of state, constitution, and election law can also 
compete. By the way, it is not true that I will never accept a 
unified currency. A unified currency between Germany, Austria, 
and Switzerland would indeed be conceivable, because economic 
capacity and order policy coincide. This is our different 
approach to Maastricht: Communization can only be the result of 
concurrence in terms of substance, it must not be forced by 
political acts of power. 
  [FOCUS] You expect to get 35 percent at the European 
elections. Where do you take this breathtaking optimism from? 
  [Brunner] We talked to opinion researches, who said: You 
have to get away from your old ideas about the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP] and about its percentages. A total of 85 
percent of the Germans reject the ECU. All established parties, 
however, are for the ECU. 
  [FOCUS] Still, there may be a difference between having 
sympathetic feelings and making a cross on the ballot sheet? 
  [Brunner] The party system, as we know it today, will be 
just as much a museum piece in a few years as the GDR's party 
system of 1988 is now. The Christian Democratic Union is just a 
structure in the wings of the national theater. If you knock 
it, the whole thing collapses.

<F P=106> [Report signed "hjs": "Kinkel: Conciliation Among </F>
Differing Views"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 8-9 Jan -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of 
the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], has said that, 
regarding the issue of easing arms export legislation, "things 
should not be forced." Kinkel conceded that the matter 
consisted of many components. The industry's anxiousness to 
produce and export arms contrasted with the political will to 
prevent the FRG from becoming "world champion for armament 
exports." It is necessary to achieve conciliation between "the 
two poles." 
  With this statement, the federal foreign minister intervened 
in the ongoing discussion on easing German export restrictions 
for arms. For months, a Federal Government working group has 
been thinking of how changes in Germany's arms export practice 
could be achieved in the course of liberalization within the 
framework of the European Union [EU]. The members of this 
working group, which is headed by Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt, share the view that the other EU members will not, 
under any circumstances, be willing to adopt Germany's very 
restrictive arms export regulations. Experts within the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU]/[CSU] 
Bundestag group have also discussed the liberalization of arms 
exports for some time. 
  The Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce 
[DIHT] was meanwhile also intervened in the debate. In a 
statement, the DIHT emphasized that, regarding the necessary 
easing of German export restrictions, one should not start with 
armament products, because it would mean taking the second step 
before the first in this sensitive area. In the DIHT's view, 
one should start with the so-called dual-use goods, that is to 
say products that can be used for both military and civilian 
purposes. Many more jobs are dependent on the export of these 
products than on armament exports. Moreover, in the sphere of 
dual-use goods there is a danger of the German economy being 
uncoupled from the international market. Therefore, the DIHT 
requests that restrictions be first eased for these goods. 
  Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
accused the government of having a new armament policy in mind. 
Considerations within the CDU are proof of it, it was said. SPD 
Bundestag deputy Klaus Kuebler said that the objective of 
harmonizing arms exports within the EU member states was 
misleading. In this connection, Kuebler said that it was 
politically and morally irresponsible for the Federal Government 
to intend to supply war ships to Indonesia. Thus, Bonn 
"brazenly" was ignoring the resolutions of the Western European 
Union [WEU], which were also supported by the Federal Government.

<F P=106> [Report signed "sm": "Early Decision"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 10 Jan -- In the future a general decision 
about the exports by international armament syndicates with 
German participation is to be made before the cooperation 
project is initiated. This has been suggested by FRG Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt, Free Democratic Party [FDP]. 
  The goal is to ensure "minimum orders" for German armament 
companies. A final political decision has not yet made on his 
ideas, Rexrodt admitted. 
  An amendment to the Military Materiel Control Law and a 
change in the Federal Government's political principles for the 
export of military weapons and other armament goods from 1982 to 
loosen the export policy is not planned, however, the FDP 
politician stressed. The Economics Minister stressed that he 
thinks a common European arms export policy is urgently 
necessary. However, he admitted that the views of the 12 EU 
member states on a unified policy in this field are still far 
apart. 
  The establishment of unified European rules for the export 
of 
so- called dual-use goods, which can be used for military and 
civilian purposes, is of particular importance, Rexrodt said. 
According to the current state of negotiations, agreement 
concerning this issue can be achieved in the Union only below 
the standard of the regulations that are valid in Germany now. 
Nevertheless, Rexrodt assessed the emerging compromise as 
progress, not least regarding the desire for equal 
competitiveness of Germany's export business.

  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- After seasonal 
adjustment, the money supply, M3, rose in November by 7.2 
percent in comparison with the fourth quarter of 1992. This was 
announced by the Bundesbank in Frankfurt am Main on Friday [7 
January]. In October the rate was 6.9 percent. 
  Frankfurt's money traders reacted calmly to the 
announcement. 
The Bundesbank will adhere to its policy of relaxation of 
interest rates, it is said in banking circles. An economist 
with the Commerzbank said: "Hopes remain for an early reduction 
in base rates." The Bundesbank stressed that it is seeking 
growth in the money supply of between 4 and 6 percent in 1994.

<F P=106> [Report signed "enn": "DIW Does Not Expect Fast Upswing"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin, 6 Jan -- The German Institute for Economic 
Research (DIW) has made a forecast for 1994 that is clearly more 
pessimistic than those of all the other German institutes. The 
Berlin-based research institute does not expect a quick economic 
upswing. On Thursday [6 January], the DIW said that a gradual 
upward trend can be expected to start in summer, at the 
earliest. The recession has not yet been overcome. German 
economic policy is characterized by illusions and wrong 
assessments in this area, the DIW said. In western Germany, the 
GNP is expected to decline by an estimated 0.5 percent this 
year. The number of unemployed in eastern and western Germany 
will go up to a total of some 4 million. In the DIW 
researchers' view, the debate about Germany as a business 
location overrates the alleged crisis of costs faced by German 
companies. No study has yet been able to prove that German 
industry has a severe lack of international competitiveness. 
The decline in profits is a "phenomenon exclusively due to 
economic cycles." Some impetus from abroad is possible; but 
export hopes can refer only to overseas markets. Besides, the 
European countries can only overcome the recession "marching in 
step." The role monetary policy plays in the development of 
recession is underestimated. Relaxing monetary policy is the 
key to an increase in investments. In the DIW's opinion, 
short-term and long-term interest rates should be approximately 
2 percentage points apart. 
  According to the DIW, the economic policy debate 
concentrates 
too much on wage policy. "Cutting wages" alone is a defensive 
strategy that is unlikely to succeed. This year, the institute 
expects moderate wage settlements "in the region of 2 percent." 
In 1996, wage increases could return to some 4 percent, a rate 
that will be appropriate in the medium term. Private 
consumption will go down by some 1.5 percent in 1994, which will 
have an enormous effect on the economy. The government's 
envisaged austerity measures will also have a restrictive impact 
on the economy. Considering this, 1994 is an unsuitable time 
for consolidating public budgets, the DIW said.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The provisional GDP figures for 
1993 released by the Federal Statistical Office are in line 
"with the expectations of the Federal Government of last fall," 
in the view of Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free 
Democratic Party). According to the figures from the 
Wiesbaden-based office, GDP for the whole of Germany decreased 
in real terms by 1.3 percent on 1992. The fall in GDP in western 
Germany was 1.9 percent and in eastern Germany GDP grew by 6.3 
percent. GDP in money terms amounted to over 3.1 trillion 
German marks [DM] of which western Germany accounts for a 
substantial 91 percent and eastern Germany for almost 9 percent. 
  In a statement issued today on these figures, Rexrodt 
pointed 
out that the average figures conceal the slight recovery which 
set in during the course of the year following the slump in the 
spring. The noticeable slowdown in price increases in all 
important demand areas is also pleasing as is the fact that 
growth in eastern Germany has broadened its base. Not only is 
the construction sector expanding there, but signs of 
improvement in the manufacturing sector are also increasing. 
However, despite strong GDP growth in eastern Germany for the 
second year, there can be no talk yet of a self-sustaining 
upswing in the east. The gap between demand and income, on the 
one hand, and production, on the other hand, still has to be 
covered by transfers from western Germany. 
  The economics minister announced that the Federal Government 
will soon set out in detail, in its annual economic report, how 
it expects the economy to perform in 1994.

  [Text] The Bundeswehr could save an estimated 3.8 billion 
German marks [DM] per year just through rationalization. This 
is indicated in a confidential interim report by an internal 
Defense Ministry working group. The savings, which correspond 
to 10 percent of the current operational expenditures of the 
armed forces, are, however, only possible "in the long run." A 
new system for monitoring costs and performance must be 
established. In the view of the working group, first 
investments of approximately DM100 million are necessary for 
this purpose -- for new computers, for instance. Under the 
slogan of "Saving must pay off," all soldiers should be 
encouraged to participate in the "constant identification of 
rationalization potential." "As far as it is useful and 
possible," logistical tasks are to be transferred to private 
companies. In addition, the working group, which consists of 
military officers and representatives of civilian consulting 
companies, suggests that armament projects should be supervised 
more strictly. Tighter management could reduce procurement 
costs by approximately DM400 million per year. In 1993, the 
Defense Ministry spent almost DM7 billion on weapons and 
ammunition.

  The French economy was in recession for most of last year, 
and the unemployment rate now stands at 12 percent. It is

<F P=106> [Interview with French Employment Minister Michel Giraud by </F>
Michele Lecluse; place and date not given] 
  [Text] While his staff is drafting the documents relating 
to the implementation of the five-year law on employment, whose 
publication will be extended until the end of March, the 
employment minister reveals in an interview to LES ECHOS the 
next stages in his action: New measures being studied to boost 
employment, bill on participation, preparation of the new 
roundtable of social partners at the Hotel Matignon [prime 
minister's office], and so forth. For the first time, Michel 
Giraud also replies to the president of the republic who is 
advocating a "new social contract." 
  [Lecluse] The prime minister is inviting the social partners 
to a roundtable meeing at the Hotel Matignon at the end of 
February. What subjects do you plan to discuss? 
  [Giraud] The aim is to implement the five-year law, 
especially as regards negotiations on the adaptation of the 
working week, and to urge the social partners who manage 
unemployment insurance to reach agreements on long-term 
compensations for reduced working time and the differential 
compensation paid to the unemployed person who finds a job. 
  In addition, it strikes me as necessary to pursue the effort 
in the sphere of reducing the cost of labor on low wages within 
the scope of available budget resources and the effort in the 
sphere of youth employment. In addition, I attach particular 
importance to the rapid development of service jobs. 
  [Lecluse] Is that not ring alarm bells? 
  [Giraud] It has been discussed for a long time, but it does 
not ring alarm bells because the five-year law has made 
provision for their development through the service voucher 
[cheque service]. On a very practical level, tenders are being 
invited for implementing it. 
  [Lecluse] What do you think of the president of the 
republic's idea for a "new social contract for employment?" 
  [Giraud] The president of the republic is putting into words 
what the government has been doing since its installation nine 
months ago: dialogue, consultation, negotiation... The 
drafting of the five-year law gave rise to a very broad exchange 
with all the social partners even before its presentation to 
Parliament. The law itself strongly revives collective 
negotiation in many spheres. 
  Thus, in the next few months, employers' and trade union 
organizations, at branch, enterprise, or establishment level, 
will have to decide on the length of the working week, the level 
of wages, initial training courses, the rate of continuous 
training, and the organization of work time (free time, 
probationary periods), the best methods to be adopted by 
institutions which represent staff, and so forth. 
  This is not an exhaustive list but it is enough to show that 
the five-year law revives social dialogue and thus gives full 
meaning and every opportunity to a new organization of relations 
between employers and employees. 
  Moreover, the employment law requires us to build ever 
broader partnerships with the regional councils, associations, 
and other regional operators, thus prompting a healthy 
decompartmentalization in the social sphere. Is it not a very 
practical and very operational task to mobilize everybody in the 
fight for employment? 
  [Lecluse] What are the grounds for the government's hope to 
stabilize employment by mid-1994 in view of the fact that the 
recovery will be much lower than the necessary level for halting 
the slide? 
  [Giraud] All the macroeconomic forecasting bodies agree in 
predicting the beginning of a reversal in the situation during 
1994, with the differences only relating to the starting point 
and the scale. However, it is obvious that the recovery would 
be too modest to generate, on its own, a number of jobs likely 
to significantly reduce unemployment. 
  However, the government is justified in hoping for the full 
effect of the emergency measures (law of 27 July 1993), the 
five-year law (better organization of work, training, youth 
employment...), and the 1994 budget. Thus, during the second 
half of 1994, we should experience an encouraging deceleration 
in the unemployment curve. 
  [Lecluse] With hindsight, if you were to draft the 
five-year law today, would you proceed in the same way? Do you 
have regrets? 
  [Giraud] The process of design, drafting, consultation, and 
then consideration of the five-year law took place over eight 
months... In all honesty, I do not think that I could now take 
a more open approach... On the other hand, with regard to some 
expectations -- I am thinking in particular of the "32-hour" 
working week -- I might envisage a more vigorous response so 
that the attention of our fellow citizens is not distracted from 
the essential issue of the law's content. Moreover, it is in 
this spirit that I have started a wide-ranging effort to provide 
information on all the new measures proposed in this law. 
  [Lecluse] The government plans to pursue the reform of 
social security funding. Do you advocate a more rapid 
implementation of the timetable to include family contributions 
in the budget or a new reduction in the sickness benefit 
contribution? 
  [Giraud] The pursuit of the reform of social security 
funding and its implementation provisions require a concerted 
and united choice by the government. I would like to confirm 
two personal convictions: 
  -- The relationship between the reduction in contributions 
and the preservation or creation of jobs is undoubtedly strong. 
  -- The effort to reduce social security contributions must 
be 
based on the minimum wage if we are to secure the maximum effect 
with regard to employment. I am therefore strongly in favor of 
speeding up the reduction in the cost of labor for the benefit 
of the lowest wages, and, moreover, this is a way of protecting 
the jobs concerned. 
  [Lecluse] Are you not afraid of creating daunting threshold 
effects by concentrating the reductions on wages in the region 
of the minimum wage at the very time when enterprises are very 
strongly limiting their wage increases? 
  [Giraud] This is a false debate in that there is no 
threshold proper. Indeed, every year until 1998, the level of 
the wage exempted increases by 10 percent in accordance with the 
process started last July. In addition, through the opportunity 
given to new enterprises to benefit from the 1998 conditions as 
from 1994, considerable room to maneuver is being opened up. In 
other words, the reductions do not fix the most modest wages at 
their present level. I am even convinced that they could 
encourage a gradual increase in them. 
  [Lecluse] Are corporate social plans being presented to you 
today better constructed than a few months ago? 
  [Giraud] Since the beginning of last fall, we have observed 
a clear improvement in the quality of social plans. The 
mobilization of the public employment services, greater 
awareness on the part of enterprise chiefs, and the early 
implementation of the provisions of the five-year law make it 
possible to further encourage alternative solutions to 
redundancies. Out of 2,000 procedures concerning enterprises 
with more than 20 employees, only 80 observations of 
shortcomings have been reported. This is a good development 
especially because the number of social plans is still worrying. 
  In reality, we are gradually moving toward company plans 
composed of three largely equal parts: one-third internal 
measures (partial unemployment, gradual early retirement, 
shorter working hours compensated over a long period, 
reorganization of the enterprise); one-third external 
conversions with reorganizing divisions, leave, and conversion 
conventions; and one-third age measures (Social Security -- 
National Employment Fund). 
  [Lecluse] Enterprises are now stepping up initiatives of 
all kinds to help employment and the unemployed. What do you 
think of social marketing? 
  [Giraud] I do not like the term "social marketing." It 
suggests that the enterprises are using employment as an 
argument for "comparative social publicity" whereas many of 
them, by becoming aware of the social and economic implications 
of unemployment, have decided to become involved themselves and 
in their way in the struggle for employment. This display of 
solidarity is constructive and beneficial and must be welcomed. 
For instance, it is reflected in the circular of 29 December 
1993 which institutes the clause of "best social policy." This 
gives priority to job creation as a selection criterion in the 
awarding of public procurement contracts. 
  [Lecluse] Will the very strong reservations, not to say 
hostility, of the social partners to the plan for a single 
alternative training option prompt you to postpone your bill, 
initially planned for spring? 
  [Giraud] You will have noted that Article 64 of the 
five-year law calls on the government to present Parliament with 
proposals aimed at "extending and harmonizing the use of 
different training measures in work contracts to help the 
young." This means that the debate is open. To clarify it, at 
my request, the Tax Inspectorate and the Health and Company 
Affairs Inspectorate have launched a mission whose conclusions I 
will have at the end of February. On that basis, I will decide 
my position and propose the guidelines which strike me as most 
beneficial for the training and employment of young people. 
However, it is very clear that I will strive to respect and 
ensure respect for the deadlines set by the legislator. If the 
bill could not be included in the spring session, I will ensure 
that it is included in the fall session. 
  [Lecluse] What progress has been made on the decree relating 
to compulsory rest periods which particularly affect banks 
wishing to open on Saturdays? 
  [Giraud] I am anxious to propose to the social partners in 
the next few weeks a perfectly balanced document relating to the 
long postponed implementation of the ruling of 16 January 1982. 
This document should safeguard the employees' most important 
gains while improving flexibility in the organization of the 
working week in the spirit of the five-year law. In this 
sphere, there cannot be any winners or losers, but, I hope, a 
better service to the public and additional jobs, especially 
part-time jobs. 
  [Lecluse] You are drafting a bill on participation. In 
addition to the financial aspect, how do you plan to encourage 
the participation of employees in the enterprise? 
  [Giraud] With the bill on participation and profit-sharing 
which I will present in the spring session, staff 
share-ownership will be given real recognition with greater 
involvement of staff representatives in supervision and 
management councils. The distribution of profit-sharing funds 
will now be such that it cannot benefit a particular category of 
employees as is still the case with the 1990 legislation. 
  With regard to participation, the conditions for drawing up 
group agreements will be made more flexible to encourage 
procedures which enable all the employees of different companies 
to benefit from the group's health. The first draft of the law 
also makes provision for the creation of a time-saving account 
and the adaptation of profit-sharing to this provision. For 
instance, it will be possible to allocate profit-sharing in the 
form of time following agreement from the social partners. In 
order to have an effect on employment, the leave resulting from 
this capitalization would be a minimum of six months.

<F P=106> [Interview with Henri Emmanuelli, Socialist Party official </F>
and former president of the National Assembly, by Joseph 
Mace-Scaron; place and date not given: "Henri Emmanuelli: `The 
Scarcity Theory'"] 
  [Text] In the opinion of the former president of the 
National Assembly, "the right has revived the thesis of an 
adjustment of the workweek" in order to "put a good face on 
social regression that is without precedent." 
  The Socialist Party [PS] has again taken the offensive on 
the 
question of employment and the adjustment of the work week. 
Henri Emmanuelli hopes that the coming special convention to 
deal with the subject of employment will undertake a critical 
analysis of the free enterprise system. 
  [Mace-Scaron] In organizing a convention on employment--and 
in particular, on the question of the 32-hour work week--isn't 
the PS attempting to reclaim title to a thesis of which it had 
been dispossessed? 
  [Emmanuelli] The PS is not holding a convention to discuss 
the 32-hour work week--which is only one issue among many 
others--but to discuss the problem of employment, which is the 
central problem of our developed democracies. To speak of 
employment necessarily implies that we are speaking of economic 
policy. For my part, I do not see how we can deal seriously 
today with the unemployment problem without undertaking a 
critical analysis of the free enterprise system. How long are we 
going to feign ignorance of the fact that this system--which 
simultaneously produces wealth and exclusion--is headed straight 
for the rocks? 
  [Mace-Scaron] Haven't the 32-hour threshold and the 
consequent loss of wages distorted the debate concerning the 
workweek and workplace? 
  [Emmanuelli] Reducing the hours of work is one of various 
methods for reducing unemployment, but it is not a miraculous 
method. It is also a method for redistributing the wealth 
produced. It is, after all, a question of social well-being. By 
its proposal to reduce the workweek to 32 hours with a 
corresponding reduction in wages, the right has revived the 
thesis of a reduction in the workweek with the aim of 
incorporating it into a program of generalized wage deflation. 
It is using this thesis to construct a theory of scarcity, 
whereby in order to reduce unemployment all that is necessary is 
to "incorporate" more wage earners into the work force without 
increasing the total amount of wages paid. The right is putting 
forward this kind of proposal in a renewed effort to put a good 
face on the unprecedented social regression that we are 
currently experiencing. 
  [Mace-Scaron] A shorter workweek used to result in increased 
access by wage earners to goods and services. Today, however, 
isn't it instead a true-false solution for the failures in the 
labor market? 
  [Emmanuelli] Absolutely. In the opinion of the right--which 
has not changed its way of thinking in a century--unemployment 
is caused by the cost of labor. In the hope of lowering the cost 
of labor, the supply of jobs is increased. This theory has never 
worked, and because it reduces income from wages, it also 
intensifies the crisis with respect to consumption. Not only 
will the wage earners lose purchasing power, but lowering their 
living standards will intensify the economic deflation and 
thereby generate unemployment, reducing to naught the sacrifice 
of the men and women who--when they agreed to a wage cut--might 
have imagined that they were "sharing" jobs. 
  [Mace-Scaron] How can you explain the great reticence 
displayed by the social partners in this debate? How can you 
carry out reform if you are unable to negotiate compromises at 
the most appropriate level--the level of the business enterprise? 
  [Emmanuelli] I believe that most of the labor union 
organizations have clearly expressed their opposition to wage 
cuts in any form. If others are undecided, they should be wary 
of the fact that "job sharing" at the level of each individual 
enterprise--where this strategy is understandable as an effort 
to cope with local pressures--will be translated into a disaster 
at the macroeconomic level. How can you justify cutting wages 
when unemployment continues to increase and the other categories 
of income are flaunting their insolent prosperity? For this is a 
fundamental point: except for a few variations, overall wealth 
has continued to grow, with the GNP increasing from 6 trillion 
francs in 1986 to more than 7.4 trillion today. France has not 
become poorer, as some would have you believe, or as others are 
pretending to believe. 
<H5>  Neo-Molletism </H5>
  [Mace-Scaron] Is it not true that the debate on the left is 
between those who believe that it is no longer possible to take 
action "except at the margin," on the one hand, and those who 
believe that a clean break with the status quo is necessary? 
  [Emmanuelli] I believe so. There has been no open debate, 
but 
rather a "repressed" debate, for the moment, between those who 
seek solutions within the framework of the free enterprise 
system and those who believe that there can be no genuine 
solution for unemployment unless that system is seriously called 
into question and subjected to a "radical critique" with the aim 
of developing an alternative model. It should be a critique not 
of the market economy--which has demonstrated its value--but 
rather of the inability of the free enterprise system to 
redistribute the wealth produced, to protect the environment, 
and to organize society for the benefit of the greatest number; 
and it should also deal with the dangers inherent in the 
doctrine of free trade. 
  [Mace-Scaron] By adopting a harsh tone toward the government 
and then putting forward "soft" [preceding word in English] 
proposals, is not the PS being waylaid by a manifestation of 
neo-Molletism [reference is to the late Guy Mollet, Socialist 
leader and prime minister in 1956-57]? 
  [Emmanuelli] I do not believe that the PS has taken a harsh 
tone toward the government. In my humble opinion, it is instead 
having difficulty freeing itself from its administrative 
reflexes and positioning itself as a genuine opposition force. 
In the context of an obvious process of social regression, its 
critiques are not always readable or coherent. I believe it is 
more in danger from "technocratism" than from neo-Molletism. It 
must not confuse the esteem of its peers with the confidence of 
the larger society, which remains to be won. 
  [Mace-Scaron] Isn't the PS tempted to reestablish an 
identity 
based on the issue of the repeal of the Falloux Law rather than 
on the duration of the workweek? 
  [Emmanuelli] The two are neither contradictory nor 
incompatible. The desire of the right to reopen the school 
controversy in a heavy-handed manner, as it has done, is a 
useless and stupid provocation in a country that has 3.3 million 
unemployed and whose national debt has grown 25 percent in one 
year, and it deserves a response. As for adjusting the hours of 
work, it is--I repeat--only one of the methods for combating 
unemployment. The real issue is the redistribution of the wealth 
produced, in order to finance social inclusion--if possible, 
through the instrumentality of work. It is obvious to me that 
the PS cannot be absent from the debate on either of these two 
issues.

<F P=106> [Article by Gilles Paris: "Preparing for the European </F>
Election -- Mr. de Villiers Will Lead Own List"] 
  [Text] There will be at least two competing lists from the 
majority at the next European Election. In addition to the 
one(s) devised by the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and the UDF 
[Union for French Democracy], "Combat pour les valeurs" 
[Defending Values], the group led by Philippe de Villiers 
(UDF-PR [Republican Party], will make its presence felt in an 
attempt to reignite the debate that went on during the 
Maastricht ratification campaign, on behalf of those whose 
opposed the Treaty. "We want a sovereign France in a new 
Europe. We want the election on 12 June to be an opportunity to 
ask for a referendum on a new European project," the Vendee 
representative [de Villiers] told his group's departmental 
officials in Paris on Sunday 8 January. 
  Mr. de Villiers' takes issue with at least six elements in 
the common platform which the two right-wing parties have been 
drawing up. These relate to the "urgent" integration of greater 
Europe, in other words, that of the former Soviet Block 
countries; the application of a "genuine Community preference"; 
the rejection of the single currency ultimately provided for by 
the Maastricht Treaty; the restoration of internal border 
controls removed pursuant to the Schengen Accord; the defense of 
a "strict and integral national citizenship"; and finally, the 
preservation of French sovereignty, "which Community practice 
has made meaningless." On the other hand, the president of the 
General Council of the Vendee Region [de Villiers] did not give 
any information on the identity of his fellow Brussels-bashing 
candidates. 
  Intent on avoiding a political split with the majority, the 
former first cohabitation minister [1986] [de Villiers] insists 
that a rival right-wing list in the European Election is no sign 
of dissidence. "The proportional voting system does not 
divide," he contends, "it enhances and enriches. Just imagine 
there is only one list, a pro-Maastricht one. What of all the 
French people who want another Europe?" Mr. de Villiers remains 
cautious, however. He does not expect high praise from the 
government for his initiative. 
  Mr. de Villiers is equally cautious in his appraisal of the 
prime minister's record; he describes Mr. Balladur as an 
"estimable and honorable" man. "The majority is large enough 
for it to include people who do not shrink from the truth," he 
suggests. While he said "no" to the GATT agreement through a 
vote of no-confidence in the prime minister, the leader of 
"Combat pour les valeurs" does commend the government for 
amending the Falloux Act [on private Catholic and state school 
funding]. "We said we would do it and so we did; it is as it 
should be and the government has earned praise for this," he 
claims.

<F P=106> [Raimondo Bultrini report: "Shelved for Reasons of State; </F>
Attorney's Office Evasive Over Mancino-Sisde Case"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The Rome Attorney's Office has slammed on 
the brakes over the Mancino case. As expected, the file on the 
interior minister will be sent to the relevant court, but 
without any requests of any kind and no inclusion on the list of 
investigatees. This was officially announced by Judge Ettore 
Torri: "The initial request to shelve the case has been 
accepted," the prosecuting attorney said at the end of a meeting 
yesterday afternoon, which was surprisingly not attended by the 
head of the capital's judicial authorities, Vittorio Mele. 
  Both Mele, through his absence, and the others, by means of 
this measure -- which has already been challenged by the 
Attorney General's Office -- intended to make it clear that they 
plan to pass on this hot potato without even touching it. It is 
a way of washing their hands of it, but also an attempt to defer 
matters at least until the elections and averting the 
resignation of a minister. Their success in this is not 
altogether certain because the investigation is not yet 
complete, and indeed it seems to have been resumed at full 
speed, with implications that are being described as "very 
important." 
  Yesterday Sabrina Broccoletti, daughter of the intelligence 
officer at the center of the scandal, was arrested by 
carabinieri. General Nunzella's carabinieri, who have been 
conducting the inquiry from the outset, presented a 
sequestration warrant signed by Assistant Prosecuting Attorney 
Michele Coiro for the seizure of the red-hot tapes recorded in 
the Sisde offices (apparently including crucial conversations 
between Broccoletti and the major protagonists of the case, from 
"tsarina" Martucci to Di Pasquale and Malpica himself) that the 
girl was about to hand over to the lawyer, Nino Marazzita, as 
reported by the press and television over the past few days. 
Broccoletti will discuss these tapes tomorrow, Wednesday, with 
the ordinary magistrates, since they are unlikely to be 
delivered in time for the interview already scheduled for this 
morning with the court of ministers. 
  The magistrates responsible for politicians' crimes will ask 
him about the positions of former Interior Ministers Antonio 
Gava and Vincenzo Scotti, but obviously, although the Rome 
Attorney's Office wants to wash its hands of the affair, it will 
also ask the civilian secret service's former administrative 
chief to talk about present Interior Minister Mancino. The 
court of ministers and the Attorney General's Office officially 
protested the conduct of the ordinary magistrates on this point: 
In two almost simultaneous letters they informed the judges at 
Piazzale Clodio that the forwarding of the file in any case 
entails his inclusion on the register and an explicit request to 
shelve the case or for further inquiries to be conducted. 
  "What can I tell you?" Judge Torri told us in this regard. 
"If the court of ministers considers our decision mistaken, it 
will send the file back to us...." "But was it so difficult for 
you to make a request?" we asked. "A request has already been 
made," the magistrate replied, "suggesting that the 
investigation into Mancino be shelved, but the court is entirely 
free to do whatever it wants, since it is the legitimate entity 
responsible for penal actions against ministers." 
  Ettore Torri refused to add much more, despite the fact that 
it was he who fought on 12 November to include Mancino on the 
register of investigatees, against the wishes of his boss, Mele, 
and he now seems resigned to respecting the latest order. The 
same goes for Michele Coiro, the other assistant judge who 
challenged the extradition request and that seems to have been 
in charge of the investigation for some time. Coiro also took 
issue publicly with Mele on a couple of occasions, going as far 
as to describe his boss as "rather naive" about the business of 
including [former Police Chief] Vincenzo Parisi on the register 
of investigatees. This could explain Mele's absence from 
yesterday afternoon's meeting, which was attended by Attorneys 
Leonardo Frisani and Aurelio Galasso, as well as Coiro and Torri. 
  It was at the end of this meeting that Torri announced the 
forwarding of the latest evidence in the Mancino case. On 
television channel 3 news he provided a very important 
explanation for those acquainted with the secrets of the Sisde 
case. Torri explained that the documents forwarded to the court 
of ministers include transcripts of the final interviews with 
former Sisde Director Riccardo Malpica; his successor, 
Alessandro Voci; and their former aides, Maurizio Broccoletti 
and Gerardo Di Pasquale. 
  The importance of this announcement is connected with the 
fact that Gerardo Di Pasquale clearly also spoke about Nicola 
Mancino's role in the business of the illegal funds. It is not 
known what was said by the former head of Sisde's logistics 
department, though hitherto his line of defense is close to that 
of Broccoletti and company, with the sole exception of Michele 
Finocchi, the last of the people questioned in this case, who is 
less willing to incriminate his superiors and politicians. 
  As for the interviews with Malpica and Voci, there have 
already been several disclosures, according to which their 
accounts coincide with regard to the role of former Police Chief 
Parisi, of the interior minister's former private secretary 
Lauro, and of Mancino himself in covering up intelligence 
officers involved in the scandal. Evidently the attorney 
general decided that these statements did not provide sufficient 
grounds for investigating a minister in office. 
  But Malpica and Voci, two other witnesses, were at the very 
summit of the organization at the crucial time being examined by 
the investigation, and initially they differed sharply -- so 
much so that Voci reported Malpica for having made him supply a 
false statement to the magistrates concerning the destination of 
the billions of lire taken from Sisde and for having made him 
sign false transfer notes relating to the funds. Last, Torri 
also explained that no consideration was given to the 
possibility of questioning Police Chief Parisi, who was 
criticized harshly by the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] in 
Naples yesterday for his "undoubted political responsibilities" 
during his time as Sisde chief with regard to the Cirillo case, 
in a clear reference also to his role in the illegal funds 
affair.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The recent municipal elections have been 
the subject of reporting and commentary in the Portuguese press. 
<H5>  Gains, Losses Discussed </H5>
  Commentator Vasco Pulido Valente lists losers and winners of 
the December municipal elections in the 17 December Lisbon 
weekly O INDEPENDENTE. The most important loser was the 
conservative Social Democratic Center party (CDS), he writes, 
which failed to make an impression even among its traditional 
rightist electorate. The CDS's political "sickness" is 
incurable, according to Pulido Valente. As it has become 
progressively weaker it has lost the trust of the electorate, a 
loss which in turn increases its weakness. 
  The Communist Party (PCP) succeeded in preserving most of 
its 
"small patrimony" of votes and municipalities. However, the PC 
failed to grow despite the unemployment problem and the economic 
recession, Pulido Valente continues. Mere survival, he 
concludes, proves that the party is a "tenacious relic" of the 
political past. 
  According to Pulido Valente, the Socialist Party, which 
increased its mayoral representation, handled its success 
"melancholically." The PS needed to inflict a "ringing defeat" 
on the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD) and to win over 
at least a third of the PCP electorate, Pulido Valente contends. 
Neither goal materialized, and PS leader Antonio Guterres cannot 
claim to be a "giant-slayer." Guterres now faces a "terrible" 
problem, because the PSD's unexpected show of strength and the 
CDS's effective disappearance has convinced some PS officials of 
the need for an alliance with the PCP, Pulido Valente reports. 
He adds, however, that he personally rejects this option, since 
the PCP exists because its differences with the PS are greater 
and more essential than the difference between the PS and the 
PSD, making impossible a "common program" or a compromise. 
Moreover, because of the distrust that three-fourths of the 
electorate feel toward the communists, any PS initiative to 
create a leftist alliance will cost the PS a considerable share 
of the moderate vote. 
  The PSD derived a number of benefits from the election, 
Pulido Valente writes. The party did well enough to sustain its 
position until the parliamentary elections in 1995. In addition, 
the CDS's losses eliminate any danger from the Right. The PDS 
will benefit in the parliamentary elections from a united vote 
against the Left, Pulido Valente concludes. 
<H5>  Consequences of Elections </H5>
  PSD luminary and commentator Miguel Jose Judice weighs the 
consequences of the municipal elections in the 17 December O 
INDEPENDENTE. Inconclusive results, the small gap between the 
two major parties, and the lack of a massive electoral turn to 
socialism mean there will be no early dissolution of the 
National Assembly by President Mario Soares, Judice writes. 
Prime Minister Cavaco Silva strengthened his position in the 
PSD. A PSD victory in 1995 now appears more likely, Judice 
continues, since the difference in votes between the PS and the 
PSD is insufficient to overcome the prime minister's personal 
popularity--the "Cavaco effect." Unless the recession deepens 
and the Left unites for the next parliamentary election, the PSD 
might well achieve another absolute majority, Judice maintains. 
The PS could receive the support of leftist voters in many 
districts provided there is a common presidential candidate for 
the left or at least a promise of postelectoral cooperation by 
the leftist parties. Thus Judice sees the municipal elections as 
the beginning of a campaign to promote the candidacy of Lisbon 
mayor and PS luminary Jorge Sampaio for president. The CDS, in 
Judice's view, has become more fragile, losing the rural vote 
without winning over the urban electorate. Judice praises the 
voters for their sense of civic-mindedness in starting to punish 
the corrupt and the incompetent at the ballot box. 
  Writing in the 17 December Lisbon daily PUBLICO, Miguel 
Sousa 
Tavares comments on the electoral results, noting that while the 
PS won "arithmetically," it did not do so "psychologically." Low 
voter turnout was chiefly responsible for the PS victories, 
rather than the party winning support of voters on its right and 
its left. The PS failed to smash the PCP and thus become the 
sole representative of the Left, and, writes Tavares, it failed 
to move centrist PSD voters to the left as well. The municipal 
elections were not a "general rehearsal" for 1995, when the Left 
hopes to put an end to a decade of Center-Right PSD government. 
The socialists kept a number of important mayoralties and won 
some new ones, but nothing in the municipal votes shows that the 
electorate is ready to abandon Prime Minister Cavaco Silva, 
Tavares contends.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] An unattributed article in the 17 
December Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE reported that President 
Mario Soares confided to various Socialist Party (PS) officials 
he would like to effect a rapprochement between socialists and 
communists. Citing unidentified sources close to Soares, the 
article notes that the president's staff is no longer discussing 
the dissolution of the National Assembly, an option Soares had 
been rumored to favor for some time. Instead, Soares' staff has 
focused on possible cooperation between the PS and the Communist 
Party (PCP) in the 1995 parliamentary elections. According to a 
source close to the president, the change is the result of the 
recent municipal elections. Soares was betting that the PSD 
would sustain heavy losses and that the PS would be supported by 
a significant number of communists. Disappointed in both 
instances, Soares now believes that the best way to defeat Prime 
Minister Cavaco Silva is to unite the Left. PS leader Antonio 
Guterres, however, seemingly disagrees with the president's new 
initiative, the article reports. At a meeting of the party's 
political commission, Guterres made clear that the PS will run 
alone in the next parliamentary elections and, if elected, would 
prefer to govern alone. The article cites a number of 
participants at the meeting as stating that the atmosphere was 
"very cordial" and that the minority calling for cooperation 
with the PCP quickly "lowered its flag." According to the 
article, Guterres stated at the same meeting that the PS's 
presidential candidate will not be chosen before early 1995, 
thus forestalling any talk about his own candidacy.

  [Text] Prime Minister Esko Aho is critical of the debate 
conducted in Finland about NATO's Partnership for Peace 
initiative. According to Aho, in the debate at home, Finland has 
been placed in the same position as the member countries of the 
former Warsaw Treaty. After talks with Dutch Prime Minister 
Ruud Lubbers, Aho's interpretation was that the Partnership for 
Peace initiative serves primarily the former socialist countries 
of Eastern Europe, and an open invitation has been extended to 
the other CSCE countries merely in the name of impartiality. 
  Aho thought that the countries that had sought membership in 
the European Union could progress to become observer or full 
members of the Union's defense system, the Western European 
Union, and that way possibly further into NATO membership. Aho 
said that the Finnish Government intends to ask for 
clarification of what NATO means by Partnership for Peace.

to the negotiating table, Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af 
Ugglas said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  "It is good that NATO is now sharpening its tone against the 
Bosnian Serbs. The threat of air attacks is a very sharp 
warning that the Serbs ought to take seriously," she said. 
  "The situation has worsened in recent weeks. It is a natural 
frustration that is now being expressed by the NATO countries," 
she commented. 
  Af Ugglas, the former chairwoman of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, would not say whether she 
believes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's threat issued 
Tuesday at a summit in Brussels would be carried out to lift the 
siege on threatened areas in Bosnia. 
  "That is a decision that must be taken by the UN's local 
military commanders and the UN secretary general," she concluded.

  [Text] Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha Af Ugglas has 
severely criticized Russia for threatening Latvia. Last Monday 
[10 January], Russia placed units of its border troops on alert 
after two Russian generals were arrested in Latvia. According 
to the Swedish foreign minister, such actions violate the 
principles of the CSCE, and are unacceptable.

<F P=106> [Report Inger Jagerhorn: "Minister Refuses To Sacrifice </F>
Farmers"] 
  [Text] That Sweden could be forced at the very end of its 
negotiations with the EU [European Union] to trade off 
agricultural subsidies against its membership contribution is an 
extremely sensitive issue within the government. 
  The mere thought of such a trade-off has caused Agriculture 
Minister Karl-Erik Olsson to lash out, most recently after a 
DAGENS NYHETER interview with European Affairs Minister Ulf 
Dinkelspiel on Wednesday [5 January]. 
  When DAGENS NYHETER wrote in its article that such a 
situation could arise, Karl-Erik Olsson rang Ulf Dinkelspiel and 
was, by his own admission, "a little heated." 
  As a result Ulf Dinkelspiel contacted DAGENS NYHETER and 
underlined once again what he said in the interview: that each 
specialist area will be negotiated on its own merits. 
  "I will not accept any trade-off or agree to these things 
being played off against each other," Dinkelspiel said firmly. 
  Nevertheless, both Karl-Erik Olsson and Ulf Dinkelspiel 
admit 
that even though the Swedish Government's intentions are the 
best, no one can prevent the EU's negotiators from making such a 
linkage in the final phase of the negotiations. 
  "That is the time when we could find ourselves in such a 
situation," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. "In the final stage of the 
negotiations you have to look at things as a whole." 
  According to DAGENS NYHETER's information, the risk of this 
will probably be greater, the greater the number of agricultural 
issues which remain unresolved in the final phase. That is why 
the agriculture negotiations are under time pressure so that 
they do not give rise to the risk that money for farmers will be 
played off against the contribution to the EU budget from 
Sweden's state coffers. 
  Ulf Dinkelspiel also revealed that Sweden is refraining from 
pushing its demand for a change to the basis on which membership 
contributions are calculated. This means that today Sweden is 
remaining firm on only one demand relating to its membership 
contribution -- namely that a phasing-in period of several years 
is granted before full contributions are made. 
  The Swedish membership contribution is expected to be about 
22 billion kronor. From the treasury's viewpoint a cut in 
agricultural subsidies would not be very much help. On the 
other hand, it could placate certain EU countries and help them 
accept a phasing-in period. 
  The agricultural support which Sweden is granted and the 
membership contribution which Sweden will have to pay are not 
amounts of money which can be arrived at through rough 
estimates. There are clear rules for how they are to be 
calculated. 
  This is the second time that the agriculture minister has 
reacted sharply to a cabinet colleague's presumed treachery 
vis-a-vis the farmers. The last time was when Finance Minister 
Anne Wibble said in Brussels on 23 November that the government 
must be prepared to "trade off one thing against something 
different." After a sharp reaction from Karl-Erik Olsson she 
was forced to say publicly that she was not referring to 
agriculture. 
  There still seems to be a thorn in the side of the 
agriculture minister. 
  "At the time Wibble was actually talking about budget, 
regional policy, and budget policy. It is not difficult harbor 
the suspicion that she was linking precisely these areas," 
Olsson said. 
  He reminded DAGENS NYHETER that there was a discussion "in 
parts of the Finance Ministry" and also in Social Democratic 
circles with the thrust that certain sections of agricultural 
support would be excluded in the event of Swedish membership to 
reduce the burden on the EU's budget. But it turned out that 
that model proved impossible, he said.

  [Text] Russia has affirmed that it supports a Cyprus 
solution based on the UN resolutions and criticized Turkey for 
repeatedly ignoring UN resolutions calling for the immediate 
withdrawal of the occupation troops. The Russian position was 
outlined today by Ambassador in Nicosia Boris Zenkov in his 
address at a meeting of the Larnaca district Rotary Club. 
  Russia will never support the establishment of two states in 
Cyprus, Mr. Zenkov stressed, and added that Cyprus is too small 
to be partitioned. He expressed the hope that there will be 
some positive developments this year for a balanced basis for 
negotiations in accordance with the Butrus-Ghali ideas and the 
confidence-building measures, which, as he put it, should be 
considered as a warm-up for a settlement. 
  Mr. Zenkov further noted that realism should be demonstrated 
about a Cyprus solution in the near future, adding that he does 
not believe the confidence-building measures will be implemented 
easily. He said: Many years will be necessary because of the 
long separation of the two communities. Mr. Zenkov also noted 
that he had recently informed President Glavkos Kliridhis and 
Mr. Rauf Denktas that if a solution is found to the Cyprus 
problem, Russia will propose that they be awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirella Kalostipi from Brussels--recorded] </F>
  [Text] The Greek side appears completely satisfied with 
the results of the Brussels visit, both with regard to the 
outcome of the NATO summit and inter-Atlantic cooperation as 
well as with the prime minister's contacts with the U.S. 
President. 
  Telemakhos Khitiris, the deputy prime minister, discussed 
the 
mission, saying it has been crowned with full success since, as 
he put it, there was an opportunity to outline at length the 
Greek positions on the issues occupying the Balkans as well as 
the Cyprus problem, which the Clinton Administration appears 
determined to end. 
  At last night's dinner of the 16 NATO leaders, as well as at 
today's luncheon with President Bill Clinton and Jacques Delors, 
the prime minister discussed thoroughly the situation in the 
region and the dangers inherent in an expansion of the war 
southward and the Skopje issue. The harsh positions which were 
heard from certain sides before last evening on ways of 
addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia were not included 
in the final statement of the NATO summit that was issued today. 
The interventions, particularly by Greece and Canada, 
contributed a great deal to the final resolution, which, 
although it warns the belligerent sides that a NATO air attack 
is not ruled out, gives priority to a solution through 
negotiations. 
  Greek-U.S. relations today entered officially into an 
extremely positive stage, since the time allotted for the 
Clinton-Papandreou-Delors luncheon was extended because of the 
personal interest shown by the U.S. President in being briefed 
by Mr. Papandreou on the Greek positions on a series of issues. 
The Greek prime minister outlined to President Clinton his 
views on the Yugoslav issue in general, the situation in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and Kosovo, and ended with the Skopje issue, 
saying that it is a tragic irony for pressure to be exerted only 
on Greece which is stable, European, and a NATO member and who 
has no designs on anyone. Mr. Papandreou drew the U.S. 
President's attention to this issue and asked that there be 
similar pressure and moves in the direction of the other side 
for the sake of stability, cooperation, and peace in the region. 
  The Greek prime minister also referred to our country's 
desire for good, cooperative relations with Albania and the 
initiatives Greece is prepared to take in this direction. 
  Mr. Clinton thanked the prime minister for the analysis, 
saying that he will take it into serious consideration. 
However, the U.S. President also wanted to have further 
discussions on the Cyprus issue. Following the prime minister's 
review of the situation since the Turkish intervention and 
analyzing the Greek positions, President Clinton reaffirmed his 
campaign positions on Cyprus and pledged that after his European 
tour he will deal personally with this problem, which, as he put 
it, must be solved because it leads to more general problems and 
obstacles. 
  The prime minister will return to Athens tomorrow.

  [Excerpts] Following his meeting with Admiral Khristos 
Limberis, the YEETHA [National Defense General Staff] Chief, as 
part of the traditional visit he is paying to the country, 
Admiral Boorda, Allied Commander for Southern Europe, relations 
with the Greek military leadership are being fully and 
substantively smoothen out. Replying to correspondents' 
questions, Admiral Boorda said he disagrees with a message 
issued by his office (in his capacity as commander of the U.S. 
Naval Forces in Europe) describing the new Greek Armed Forces 
leaders as being pro-government. 
  He noted that the message was written by a young officer who 
was trying to understand what was happening in Greece at that 
time. He stressed that it was a shame that the text was leaked. 
[passage omitted] 
  The admiral said this message certainly does not affect his 
good relations with Admiral Limberis. He added that the Greek 
YEETHA also issues messages that the chief possibly does not 
check. Admiral Limberis agreed with this observation, noting 
that it is practically impossible to check every message. He 
noted, however, that measures should be taken in such cases. 
During the talks, Boorda and Limberis discussed the issue of 
the establishment of a NATO headquarters [in Greece], 
particularly the installation of a multinational rapid 
intervention division. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Nur Batur under the "Diplomacy Corridor" rubric: </F>
"Clinton's Policy on Iraq and Disappointment for Ciller"] 
  [Text] Turkey has been unable to find a way out of the 
impasse in which it found itself after the Gulf war. So, Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller justifiably decided to take up the file on 
the embargo on Iraq as soon as she came to power. 
  Ciller may have made a mistake at first by launching a 
campaign to lift the embargo and by revealing that she might 
even cooperate with President Yeltsin on the issue. She had to 
retract her initiative when she visited Washington. But her 
starting point was right. The United States is debating the 
embargo on Haiti and Europe seems to have forgotten Saddam 
Husayn. Apart from a few UN and U.S. State Department officials 
who watch Iraq, everyone else seems to have forgotten the 
embargo. But the forgotten embargo has cost Turkey $20 billion 
and the figure is rising every day. 
  Obviously, Ciller was right to discuss the loss Turkey 
incurred from the embargo with President Clinton in Washington, 
a loss that is gradually having more serious effects on the 
economic and social fields in Turkey. Clinton showed 
understanding toward Ciller's complaints at first. 
<H5>  Disappointment for Ciller </H5>
  What happened later? The Turkish and U.S. delegations met to 
hold talks. Files were opened and the measures needed to help 
Turkey redeem its loss were discussed. The U.S. proposal 
emerged at the end of the talks: "The United States should 
extend credit to Turkey." Needless to say, that disappointed 
Ankara. Clinton hasn't moved to help Ankara reduce the 
embargo's heavy burden on Turkey and has even failed to agree to 
clearing the oil from the Ceyhan-Iskenderun pipeline, which has 
begun to corrode, in return for Iraq's debts to Turkey. 
Consequently, Ciller is looking for a new escape route. 
<H5>  Can She Persuade Saddam? </H5>
  Considering Washington's approach, Ankara has moved to find 
a 
way to persuade Baghdad. That was why the under secretary of 
the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs was recently invited to 
visit Turkey for the first time since the Gulf War. Washington 
may have been displeased with the invitation but Ankara believes 
the visit is very important. The talks that are expected to 
take place next week can be viewed as Turkey's move to persuade 
Saddam Husayn. Turkey is convinced that the controlled sale of 
oil from the Ceyhan-Iskenderun pipeline will be helpful to 
Turkey and Iraq. 
  The UN proposal that Iraq be allowed to sell oil worth $1.6 
million to meet its urgent needs is not new. But Saddam Husayn 
is opposed to any UN control over the use of the profit Iraq 
will make from the sale. The UN officials insist that they 
control the way Iraq will use the amount it will have after 
Baghdad's debts to Turkey are paid and an amount is allocated to 
the war reparation fund. 
  Saddam Husayn agreeing to the UN proposal without objection 
will be an important political and economic development for 
Iraq. It may be allowed to sell more of its oil if the Baghdad 
administration agrees to the UN formula, regardless of its sales 
being subject to control. That will be an important step for 
lifting the embargo. 
  Resuming oil sales will prevent corrosion in the pipeline, 
which has cost millions of dollars. Undoubtedly, the sale is 
regarded as a way to help Turkey reduce the loss it has suffered 
during the past three years. The political implications of 
putting that formula into effect are equally important. Baghdad 
can have its sovereignty over north Iraq registered. 
  Naturally, Baghdad's anxiety is justified. It is convinced 
that the Kurds may move to sabotage the pipeline when the 
pumping of oil is resumed. But the Turkish Government is 
prepared to maintain the pipeline's security. 
<H5>  Can Ciller Persuade Saddam? </H5>
  In short, Turkey is not only trying to redeem the loss it 
has 
incurred because of the embargo but it is also intensifying its 
diplomatic initiatives aimed at obstructing the establishment of 
a Kurdish State in north Iraq. 
  Can Ciller, who has not received Clinton's approval, 
persuade 
Saddam Husayn?

<F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Military Measures Against </F>
Moscow and Athens"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been reported that Turkey has taken 
military measures to deal with any possible threat, particularly 
from Moscow and Athens. The officials have said that Turkey has 
been worried by Russia's move to quickly convert its cumbersome 
military forces into an army capable of taking swift action and 
by the steps Greece has taken in the same direction. 
  Stressing that Turkey is also restructuring its military 
forces, the officials asserted: "An effort is being made to 
establish a smaller army that will be capable of taking quick 
action with very high fire power." 
  It has been ascertained that the summit held on security 
discussed the threat to Turkey the day before yesterday. It 
also agreed on the need to convert the Turkish Army into a 
military force capable of taking quick action. There was a 
decision to strengthen the Turkish Armed Forces when the cold 
war ended, but that decision was not pursued. 
  Recalling that Turkey has not made significant changes in 
its 
threat concept for many years, several sources said that the 
threat to Turkey comes from all sides -- from the north, south, 
east, and west. That, they said, was also the case in the past. 
<H5>  Anxiety Caused by Russia </H5>
  The Turkish experts on strategy have been worried by 
Russia's 
recent move to change its doctrine and base several of its air 
force units in the southern part of the Caucasus. Meanwhile, 
the Papandreou Government's disclosure that Cyprus and the 
Aegean Sea are "Hellenic regions" has created a tense atmosphere 
between Ankara and Athens. Greece's claim that it has the right 
to fortify the Greek islands in the eastern part of the Aegean 
Sea has compelled Ankara to take certain measures.

<F P=106> [Report by Sezai Sengun: "A Secret Memorandum to Greece"] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has 
drawn up a report which will have a significant impact on 
Turkey's relations with Greece. 
  The report seems more like a memorandum to Athens, which 
recently adopted a hostile approach to Turkey and moved to place 
Cyprus within the Greek defense zone. It has been submitted to 
the pertinent departments affiliated with the prime minister's 
office. 
  HURRIYET has been able to acquire the report. It says in 
part: "The question of to which country the Aegean islands, 
which do not have a military status, belong will be placed on 
the agenda if Greece continues to arm them." That is a very 
strong warning. 
  The report outlines the following: 
  1. The non-military status of the Aegean islands has been 
established by international agreements, which are still valid. 
That state of affairs concerns Turkey's security. 
  2. However, Greece's effort to weaken the status of the 
islands will place the question of to which country they belong 
on the agenda. That is due to the fact that the status of the 
islands and the question of to which country they belong have 
been jointly established by those agreements. 
  3. The islands in the Aegean Sea do not have a military 
status. Any move to overlook that fact will automatically raise 
the question of which country they belong to. 
  The report notes that Samothraki, Limnos, Khios, Samos, 
Ikaria, Astipalaia, Rhodes, Kalki, Lipsoi, Kos, and 
Kastellorizon have been turned into arms depots and that this 
state of affairs has recently created a very significant 
disadvantage for Turkey's security. It says that the islands 
have been armed since 1964, contrary to the Lausanne and Paris 
Agreements. But that activity gained momentum when the PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Government came to power in 
Greece. The report makes the following assessment: "Greece has 
stepped up its efforts to undermine the status of the Aegean 
islands through faits accompli. Naturally, that state of 
affairs will place the question of to which country they belong 
on the agenda." 
  In a statement to HURRIYET on the matter, a diplomat has 
said: "The meaning of that is quite clear. Turkey will move to 
claim rights on those islands if Greece maintains its present 
approach."

  [Text] Ankara, Dec.11 (AA) -- Turkey is following the oil 
exploration activities of Greece in the open seas of Aegean 
island Thasos, very closely. 
  Foreign Ministry sources said today that waters 4-5 km west 
to the Thasos island are not among the disputed regions between 
the two countries. 
  The Greek Government had announced that it might carry out 
further drilling activities in the Aegean if the current 
explorations yield a positive result. 
  Turkey is closely following these activities so that they 
are 
not expanded to the disputed areas determined in the Bern 
Agreement of 1976 on the two countries' continental shelf. 
  Under the Bern Agreement both countries had ended their 
explorations in disputed waters of the Aegean. 
  Athens had filed a complaint before the International Court 
of Justice in the Hague and the U.N. Security Council against 
Turkey which began exploring oil in the Aegean, after Greece. 
  As Greece sought the approval of these bodies to declare the 
Aegean as a Greek sea, the International Court of Justice had, 
in 1976, called on for a Turkish-Greek dialogue to resolve the 
matter. 
  Turkish and Greek officials which came together in November 
1976 had taken conciliating steps in resolving the continental 
shelf matter. 
  The continental shelf issue was aggravated by the new PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government of Greece in 1981 
and Premier Andreas Papandreou has ended the talks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Nahit Mentese by Reha </F>
Muhtar on the "Firing Line" program; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Muhtar] What does Turkish 
intelligence know at the moment concerning the actions and 
whereabouts of Apo [Abdullah Ocalan]? 
  [Mentese] According to our information, Apo is currently in 
Syria. Our intelligence indicates that he is going and coming 
in various places in Syria. The Syrian authorities, in turn, 
claim the opposite. They say that Apo is not in Syria. 
According to our intelligence reports, Apo is currently in 
Syria. 
  [Muhtar] Did the Syrian interior minister state that the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] is a terrorist organization? 
  [Mentese] Naturally, they also accept this. We say he is 
there, and they say no. They invited me to visit Syria. I 
wanted our working groups to meet first. They sent their 
working groups twice. The second delegation returned a few days 
ago and our working group went to Syria. I have not met with 
them yet; I believe they only returned yesterday. Now, the 
Foreign Ministry wants me to go. I think that I will visit 
Syria during this month. 
  [Muhtar] Press reports note that when you are in Syria you 
will be shown the al-Biqa' Valley [as heard] and you will be 
allowed to tour the area. Is this correct? 
  [Mentese] I do not know. Syria, of course, has sovereignty 
within its borders. 
  [Muhtar] What are your demands? 
  [Mentese] My demands will be determined in line with the 
conditions. I do not want to say anything at the moment. I may 
or may not go to the area, but our main goal is to prevent this 
leadership from taking refuge in Syria. If we are neighbors and 
friends with Syria and we want to cooperate and develop our 
economic, social, and cultural relations with it, then it is our 
right to demand that this leadership cadre not be harbored in 
Syria. 
  [Muhtar] It is a widely held opinion that the leadership 
cadres of a terrorist organization are very important and that 
terrorist organizations will collapse if these cadres are 
eliminated. Do you share this view? 
  [Mentese] Leadership cadres are naturally important, as in 
every field. If the leaders are weakened or destroyed, then the 
terrorist organization tends to disperse. There may be 
resistance in places, but [word indistinct] will happen. 
  [Muhtar] Within this context, does the government strategy 
for 1994 include crushing the leadership cadres of the PKK? 
  [Mentese] Naturally; from all aspects. It is our state's 
aim to crush this terrorist organization, which is disturbing 
Turkey and our people. 
  [Muhtar] How will this be achieved? 
  [Mentese] As you can see, our security forces are 
continuously conducting operations. Our intelligence 
organizations are working and we are assessing this information. 
The state has various intelligence organizations and we are 
fighting the terrorist organization in line with the information 
supplied by these sources. 
  [Muhtar] In the past, there was an organization named 
Black September and Israel eliminated its leaders. Later, 
Israel was described as a terrorist country. Would Turkey 
consider undertaking such an operation abroad against the 
leadership cadres of the PKK? 
  [Mentese] This would be possible only through cooperation. 
If that country would allow it, we would naturally go there. 
If they say come because we are unable to deal with this, then 
we would go immediately. 
  [Muhtar] Has Syria not accepted yet that Apo has been in 
Syria? Turkish journalists met with him. 
  [Mentese] No, they do not accept it. They say that they do 
not know. We do tell them about journalists' meetings with him. 
  [Muhtar] He even held a news conference. He has a residence 
in Damascus. What is the reaction to all this? 
  [Mentese] They do not say much. They ask us to come and see. 
  [Muhtar] Is there any question of launching an operation 
into Syria? 
  [Mentese] Such an operation can only be conducted in 
cooperation with Syria. 
  [Muhtar] Have they submitted such a request? 
  [Mentese] They may. We may reach that point at the end of 
talks. We do not want to obtain results by fighting with our 
neighbors. 
  [Muhtar] Is this possible in the near future? 
  [Mentese] Yes, it is possible. Things could suddenly 
develop. 
  [Muhtar] When we ask you questions, you say that this matter 
will be resolved. Do you know something that we do not? 
  [Mentese] I said this is possible. We asked Syrian 
authorities to expel, extradite, or punish him. We told them 
that he is a bandit and he orders people killed. 
  [Muhtar] Does Syria comply with this approach? 
  [Mentese] I do not know. There is a certain amount of 
temperance. I believe Syria, too, will say yes at some point. 
  [Muhtar] Is there anything you have failed to tell us with 
regard to contacts with Syria? 
  [Mentese] No. I told you everything. Our aim is to 
cooperate with them on these issues, on narcotics. 
  [Muhtar] I mean with regard to the Syrians' attitude? 
  [Mentese] We find their attitude warm and sincere. I hope 
and estimate that we will be able to cooperate soon. 
  [Muhtar] Is this possible in the next few months? 
  [Mentese] Yes, it is possible. Our visits are not for 
tourism purposes. I will go there to obtain results, not for 
tourism. We will appeal to their common sense and try to obtain 
results. We want to conclude this matter by spring. 
  [Muhtar] Do you mean the leaders as well? 
  [Mentese] Yes. We want to shatter them totally. [passage 
omitted]

Governor; dated 12 January 1994 -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] So far, eighteen terrorists were killed during 
operations started by the security forces on Kato Mountain near 
Hakkari on 10 January and which were supported by air units. 
One security person was martyred during the clashes. 
  Also, a big group of terrorists who arrived from northern

gendarmerie border post in Cukurca District in Hakkari at 2030 
on 11 January. At least 13 terrorists were killed in the clash 
that erupted following the attack. Two privates were martyred 
during the initial attack by the terrorists. 
  Area search operations continue in both regions. 
  Meanwhile, Major Mehmet Sahin, commander of the Elazig 
Commando Battalion, and a private were martyred in the clash 
that erupted between terrorists and the security forces in 
Suveren in Bingol Province. Extensive operations are under way 
to catch the terrorists who fled after the incident. 
  Also, two terrorists were killed in a clash with the 
security

  [Text] During the NATO summit, Prime Minister Dehaene has 
repeated that Belgium does not intend to outlaw the Kurdish 
nationalist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] party, but Belgium 
does condemn the terrorist activities of the PKK. Dehaene had a 
short talk with his Turkish colleague Ciller at the summit. 
  Turkey had asked Belgium to ban the PKK after the recent 
Turkish-Kurdish riots in Brussels. Belgium, however, is 
sticking to its own policy. Dehaene said that the government 
would decide itself how to deal with problems here. He asked 
the Turkish premier to solve the problems between the Turkish 
Government and Kurdish minority through negotiation, and pointed 
out that Belgium had solved its community problems peacefully.

<F P=106> [Interview with Charles Pasqua, minister of state for </F>
Interior and Terrritorial Development, by Franz-Olivier 
Giesbert, in Paris--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Charles Pasqua, good morning. 
  [Pasqua] Good morning. 
  [Giesbert] You are the deputy prime minister of the 
government. So far, everybody agreed that you had not made any 
mistakes. You have changed quite a lot. 
  [Pasqua] Do you think so? 
  [Giesbert] Yes. You have become quite consensual. 
  [Pasqua] No, not especially. 
  [Giesbert] In any case, two affairs have tarnished your good 
image recently, one after the other. First of all, the Kraouche 
affair. One of the documents found at the home of the Algerian 
Islamic activist is alleged to belong to the French counter- 
intelligence services. It is not very nice. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Let us now talk about the Iranians affair. In 
1986, you promised you would terrorize terrorists. 
  [Pasqua] And so I did. 
  [Giesbert] Yes. We are now under the impression that the 
terrorists are the ones terrorizing. 
  [Pasqua] When I arrived at the Ministry of Interior in 1986, 
bombs were going off in Paris and we had 10 being held hostage. 
We did what we had to do. We do not feel any misplaced vanity 
about it, but you will notice that at the time, we did not 
explain what we were doing either. You can now see the results. 
  [Giesbert] You sent two suspects back to their home country 
in order to enable them to escape from the Swiss judiciary, 
didn't you? 
  [Pasqua] The issue is not to enable them to escape from the 
Swiss judiciary. The issue, when one is faced with this type of 
situation, as I explained yesterday -- [pauses] the role of the 
interior minister is first and foremost to guarantee the 
security of people and property in France and to see to it that 
threats coming from abroad do not damage French interests, in 
France or elsewhere. 
  [Giesbert] The Americans have asked you for explanations. 
  [Pasqua] I do not have to give any explanations to the 
Americans. I am not an employee of Mr. Clinton's. I know that 
the Americans have on their territory one of the FIS [Islamic 
Salvation Front] leaders abroad, Mr. Anouar Adnan. We 
protested, and they answered that they could not do anything 
about it. 
  [Giesbert] Didn't you deport these Iranians suspects to get 
Tehran's help against Algerian FIS Islamic fundamentalists? 
This is what everyone thinks. 
  [Pasqua] It is typical of journalists to speculate. 
  [Giesbert] When the state interest is put forward, we have 
no 
choice but to find out what the state interest may be. 
  [Pasqua] Indeed, it is only normal; it is totally logical. 
However, should we give you an explanation, I am convinced that 
it would not satisfy you and that you would think there was more 
to it. 
  [Giesbert] It is our job. 
  [Pasqua] It is indeed. You may calculate, speculate, 
prophesy, do. But when national interest is at stake -- and I 
believe that the prime minister said clearly that it was the 
case -- some things cannot be said. [sentence indistinct] 
  [Giesbert] Despite all this, you have cause for 
satisfaction: 
crime has decreased by 0.6 per cent since April, when you 
arrived at Place Beauvau [Interior Ministry]. Do you think that 
it is due to the fact that you frighten deliquents? 
  [Pasqua] No, I do not believe that it is due to the fact 
that 
I frighten deliquents. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva by </F>
correspondent Antonio Esteves Martins on 11 January; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] It was confirmed this morning that 
the current members of NATO are willing to extend the 
organization to include the democratic states of Eastern Europe. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Martins] For the first time in its history, NATO has 
enabled 
its military and logistic structure to be at the service of the 
WEU, so that in the context of military operations, the European 
allies can implement their common defense and security policy. 
  [Cavaco] There is, therefore, a major change taking place in 
NATO. The WEU is the political arm of the European Union for 
the implementation of the defense policy. But at the same time 
it is NATO's European pillar. NATO as a whole is interested and 
strongly committed to strengthening this European pillar of NATO. 
  [Martins] Above all, because we are to witness a reduction 
of 
the U.S. presence in Europe, the allies should from now on have 
a more active role in their own security. This situation 
pleases Portugal, moreover, because it will reinforce the 
importance of the Lajes air base [Azores]. 
  [Cavaco] The Azores are today, and increasingly, seen as 
Portugal's contribution to peace in the world, because you 
should also bear in mind that this summit has reaffirmed the 
possibility of operations outside the area, with the involvement 
of NATO troops in association with troops from non-NATO 
countries. [passage omitted] 
  [Martins] If you were not the Portuguese prime minister but 
the prime minister of Hungary, Poland, or even Slovakia, would 
you feel satisfied and safe with what is written in the final 
communique? 
  [Cavaco] I would have to be realistic. But I am not 
surprised that the leaders of Poland, or Czechoslovakia [as 
heard], or others, would like the community or the alliance to 
give more concrete and precise steps toward enlargement, but I 
think this would be a mistake.

<F P=106> [Zafer Kiraz video report from Brussels] </F>
  [Text] The NATO summit meeting, which began yesterday, 
ended with a final communique today. Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller also held a meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Dehaene today. Following this meeting, Ciller held a news 
conference at NATO Headquarters and commented on the summit 
meeting as well as her bilateral contacts. The Partnership for 
Peace plan, terrorism, Turkey's membership in the Western 
European Union [WEU], and bilateral contacts with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and her Belgian counterpart were among the 
important issues addressed by Ciller in her news conference. 
  It was learned that the incidents caused by the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] in Brussels and the struggle against 
terrorism were particularly stressed during the meeting between 
Ciller and Dehaene. In a news conference she held later, Ciller 
declared that the recent developments in the world have 
increased NATO's importance and have raised the issue of east 
European countries' relations with the alliance. Recalling that 
the partnership for peace plan proposed by the United States 
within this framework was accepted at the summit, the prime 
minister noted that the plan brings a flexible approach to the 
current situation. The implementation of the plan envisages a 
premembership cooperation process for NATO's relations with 
Eastern European countries, Ciller said. She pointed out that 
this plan, which Turkey supports, does not exclude any of the 
said countries. 
  In response to a question on her bilateral talks with 
Clinton, Ciller said: 
  [Begin recording] As you know, Turkey is in the process of 
assuming a position in the WEU. We want Turkey to become a full 
member. We also want Turkey to occupy a position within the 
European Union. Therefore, the relations between Turkey and the 
West are extremely important. The support to be accorded to us 
by the United States in this matter is still important. We 
spoke within this context. We discussed the extent of Turkey's 
future moves and possible U.S. support for these moves. We 
focused on the importance of acting together especially with 
regard to the struggle against terrorism in the Western world 
and in the Middle East. Continued U.S. support in these issues 
is important from the viewpoint of discussing the fight against 
terrorism in the international arena. We had the opportunity to 
dwell on these issues as well. [end recording] 
  Ciller announced that the embargo imposed on Iraq was also 
discussed with Clinton: 
  [Begin recording] As you know, the United States has granted 
us a series of opportunities on this subject. The lifting of 
the embargo on Iraq is not a matter only between Turkey and 
Iraq. This is an international matter and is dependent on 
decisions which must be adopted by the United Nations. As you 
know, however, various subcommittees are working between Turkey 
and the United States. There have been certain developments as a 
result of these talks. [end recording] 
  The prime minister stated that the relations between Turkey 
and the United States are developing in a satisfactory manner. 
Referring to Clinton's scheduled meeting with Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad, a journalist asked Ciller if Turkey has a request 
from the United States on this subject. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I conveyed to Clinton the general 
views held by Turkey. I am pleased to say that the struggle 
against terrorism was included in the NATO communique in a way 
that will raise it on the international level. Moreover, we 
obtained the support of the United States on the West and now 
for the Middle East as well. [end recording] 
  Announcing that she held a bilateral meeting with Belgian 
Prime Minister Dehaene today, Ciller said the following: 
  [Begin recording] We made a general assessment. We relayed 
our views on the PKK. We again referred to the subject of 
cooperation in the struggle against terrorism, a matter 
underlined by NATO, the United Nations, and the entire Western 
world. We are pleased to see that Belgium, too, is preparing to 
undertake moves on this subject. The Belgian prime minister 
stated that his government wants to cooperate in the struggle 
against terrorism and is working on this. In other words, he 
said that Belgium is preparing to combat terrorism and wants to 
cooperate. He remarked that the PKK is not isolated from other 
Kurdish associations. At the moment, however, Belgian officials 
accept that the PKK is a terrorist organization and declare that 
they will adopt the necessary measures. The PKK is not separate 
from other Kurdish associations, Dehaene noted, adding that it 
has been documented that the PKK is now a terrorist organization 
and work is under way to adopt the necessary measures on this 
issue. [end recording] 
  Answering reporters' questions on Iraq, Ciller said: 
  [Begin recording] Iraq's territorial integrity is extremely 
important. Furthermore, energy reserves are concentrated in the 
Middle East. Any border change for any reason in this area 
could seriously threaten stability. We had the opportunity to 
clearly explain all of these views. Our agenda consisted of 
international cooperation in the struggle against terrorism, 
cooperation in the international arena, the incorporation of the 
Unites States in this cooperation, and the continuation of this 
cooperation both in Europe and the Middle East. [end recording] 
  A reporter asked Ciller if Greek Prime Minister Papandreou 
expressed any views on the Cyprus issue, to which the prime 
minister replied: 
  [Begin recording] No, he did not express any views 
concerning Cyprus. We would be pleased to see him in Turkey. 
The important thing is the ability to act together on many 
subjects. Dialogue is important for this. From Turkey's 
standpoint, I believe that we will have the opportunity to 
inform world public opinion that we have very solid views on 
this subject. [end recording]

  [Text] During a news conference at the end of the NATO 
summit in Brussels, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
confirmed that, in the spring, Spain and the other countries 
with troops in Bosnia will reassess their presence in the 
region, taking into account the paradox that the presence of 
these troops is not making a peace agreement any easier. Our 
correspondent Nacho Hernandez has the story. 
  [Hernandez] Before spring, the Spanish prime minister will 
have to reassess the presence of the blue helmets sent to 
Bosnia. A decision that will not be made unilaterally. There 
are even doubts about whether the UN presence is helping to 
reach a peace agreement in former Yugoslavia. In Gonzalez's 
opinion, the NATO decision reached today is a solemn warning to 
the parties in conflict. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] There is a certain feeling of 
frustration, because the purpose of having forces there is to 
accomplish certain missions, and objectively the missions are 
there to benefit the civilian population in all the conflict 
areas. Consequently, it does not seem tolerable that these 
forces should be used, hindered, or used as they have sometimes 
been used, as targets of attack or in a political game in which 
the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] does not take part. So there 
is a clear awareness of the fact that they [the parties in 
conflict] should clearly know that we are ready to defend the 
UNPROFOR forces in the field. [end recording] 
  [Hernandez] According to Felipe Gonzalez, this summit has 
clarified the North American attitude toward the conflict in 
former Yugoslavia. In his opinion, uncertainties about NATO's 
future have also been cleared up. He said the Partnership for 
Peace for East European countries is also a message to Russia so 
that it take part in the global European construction. 
  There is satisfaction on behalf of Spain because the final 
communique includes references to the importance of stability in 
the Mediterranean. According to the prime minister, it was very 
important that NATO make this cooperation effort with the area. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] The obsession with trying to 
consolidate a situation of peace, stability, and democratization 
in the East does not take up all our energies. For the first 
time a door is opened to future development of relations with 
the countries of North Africa, with the Mediterranean area. I 
think this is a positive development. For us it was 
interesting, because there were doubts about whether some 
alliance countries were going to accept this new dimension or 
not. This possibility now exists, and consequently the Council 
will study how to carry it out. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The NATO summit has ended in Brussels. [passage 
omitted] Cid Saldanha reports: 
  [Saldanha] [Passage omitted] NATO is to intervene in two 
areas of former Yugoslavia, using force if necessary. The 
objectives will be to protect UN contingents in Srebrenica and 
to reopen the airport in Tuzla. This limited action was decided 
at last night's dinner, attended by the heads of state and 
government of the Sixteen. The action is not aimed at resolving 
the Yugoslav problem, the solution to which can only be a 
political one, Prime Minister Cavaco Silva said today. 
  [Begin Cavaco recording] Therefore, the outcome of this 
summit, as a result of the accord achieved last night, is a very 
clear statement that the allies have asked the United Nations or 
the UN Security Council to take measures to protect UN soldiers, 
to enable the rotation of the Canadian soldiers, and to enable 
the opening of Tuzla airport to humanitarian aid. In 
anticipation of what you may ask, [let me say that] in this 
declaration and in what was agreed yesterday, the use of air 
strikes is implicit, if deemed necessary in order to achieve the 
objectives. [end recording] 
  [Saldanha] As for the possibility of such an involvement 
representing greater Portuguese participation, Cavaco did not 
rule it out, but said that this was not likely for now. 
  [Begin Cavaco recording] We cannot exclude ourselves from 
making a contribution to peace operations, via NATO, via the 
Western European Union, and via the United Nations. But at the 
moment, and in line with last night's discussions, the question 
is not one of increasing the number of troops on the ground. 
[end recording] 
  [Saldanha] However, Cavaco Silva said that Portugal had made 
available a small team of air traffic controllers that could be 
stationed at Tuzla airport. The question of Bosnia has somewhat 
altered the outcome of this summit that had centered on the U.S. 
proposal Partnership for Peace. Cavaco Silva described this 
proposal as the future of world security and described this 
summit as one of the most important ever in NATO. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] The NATO summit ended in Brussels this morning. 
[passage omitted] Armando Pires, our special envoy, reports. 
  [Pires] [passage omitted] During a meeting with Portuguese 
journalists, Prime Minister Cavaco Silva described as historic 
the decisions made at this summit. Cavaco Silva welcomed the 
American decision to keep Europe as one of its defense 
priorities, and said he believed the summit had eliminated the 
areas of disagreement between NATO and the WEU [Western European 
Union]. The Prime Minister said the conditions have been 
created for both NATO and the WEU to dedicate themselves fully 
to the peace operations entrusted to them. One of the decisions 
Cavaco Silva described as historic was the Sixteen's approval of 
the Partnership for Peace plan. An evolutionary process, 
according to him, which will depend on its interpretation by the 
East European countries. As is known, the document was not all 
the Polish, Hungarians, Czechs, and Slovaks wanted, but Cavaco 
Silva explained this with the need not to isolate Moscow in this 
process. 
  [Begin Cavaco recording] We had an Iron Curtain which was 
destroyed, and we must not do anything now which would represent 
moving an Iron Curtain further east. The main advantage of this 
Partnership for Peace is nondiscrimination. It does not 
discriminate between any country belonging to the CSCE, it 
promises (?peace to all), and I think it would in fact be a 
mistake at the moment to discriminate against Russia or Ukraine 
or Belarus, or any other country. It is open to all countries 
which want to commit themselves to the strengthening of security 
in Europe. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Pires] In the last part of this press conference, Cavaco 
Silva expressed the satisfaction of the Portuguese Government 
which, following Spain's example, wanted this Brussels summit to 
voice its commitment to the defense and security of the 
Mediterranean. Europe is today affected not only by the waves 
of immigration caused by the regional conflicts spreading in the 
region, but also feels the danger caused by the political and 
military instability in the so-called European southern flank. 
Cavaco Silva revealed that a high-level group was set up to 
study the situation in the southern Mediterranean.

  [Excerpts] The NATO summit ended late this afternoon. The 
heads of state and government of the military alliance decided 
to express their concern about the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] 
  Several delegations, including Belgium's, refrained from 
setting a timetable for intervention, recalling that it is not 
up to NATO to launch air strikes, since operations in the area 
are made at the request of the United Nations. Here is Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene speaking in an interview with Willy 
van der Vort: 
  [Begin Dehaene recording] Let us say that NATO has clearly 
confirmed its willingness and its support for intervention, but 
that these are UN actions, and the decision has to be taken by 
the United Nations. So, contrary to the impression that might 
have been given after the statement by the secretary general 
yesterday evening, there is no misunderstanding between the 
United Nations and NATO. What NATO is putting forward today are 
actions to be implemented within the United Nations, and the 
final decision will be taken by the United Nations. 
  The Serbs said yesterday that air intervention against their 
positions in Bosnia could have serious consequences. We have to 
keep this in mind, but I think at the same time that to remain 
without action is fraught with another danger, namely that the 
Serbs will think they can do what they like. [end recording]

  [Interview with British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind 
by announcer Jeremy Paxman in London on 11 January; from the 
"Newsnight" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Paxman] Why have we changed our minds about bombing 
in Bosnia? 
  [Rifkind] I do not accept the premise of your question. We 
announced last August, the NATO Council said last August, that 
in certain circumstances, particularly in order to ensure that 
aid got through, it might be necessary to contemplate air 
strikes. We have the particular problem at the moment in 
Srebrenica where a Canadian unit is due to be replaced by a unit 
of another country -- that is being prevented, it is right and 
proper that we should take action if necessary to achieve that. 
  [Paxman] But why should Radovan Karadzic take it any more 
serious this time than experience has shown he should take it in 
the past? 
  [Rifkind] On the contrary, I think after the announcement by 
NATO last August about the possibility of much tougher action if 
steps were not taken immediately by the Serbs and other parties 
to stop unacceptable behavior, the situation improved. 
  [Paxman] But it is the case isn't it that any individual 
country within NATO would have a right of veto on any bombing 
mission? 
  [Rifkind] I think what you want to see is two things. First 
of all there has to be a request from the United Nations itself. 
Now NATO -- the countries of NATO -- have agreed that if we are 
requested by the United Nations, if it falls within the mandate 
that has been laid down, then it is right and proper that we 
should respond, particularly if it is the only way of getting 
aid through in the circumstances that have been outlined. 
  [Paxman] A particular concern is expressed by the Canadians 
who have troops as you say in Srebrenica, and they are 
distinctly lukewarm as far as one can see about the idea of 
bombing, because it is their troops that are at risk. 
  [Rifkind] Well, clearly we would have to take into account 
the nature of the situation, and if the people whom we trying to 
help were people, who for very understandable reasons, were 
unattracted by that particular solution then obviously their 
views would carry great weight. We are not talking about 
veto's, we are talking about common sense. 
  [Paxman] Now, for the last few weeks, we have had both 
British and French Government's making no more than exploratory 
noises about the fact that we cannot keep troops in Bosnia 
indefinitely. Now you are talking about possible military 
operations in the air. Is the bombing campaign some sort of 
prelude to withdrawal? 
  [Rifkind] We have made it abundantly clear we have every 
intention of continuing throughout this winter. It is 
absolutely important that we do all within our power to try and 
ensure that tens of thousands of people do not starve over the 
next few weeks, over the next two or three months.

  [Text] NATO will have to show great caution over using air 
strikes against Bosnian Serbs, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind 
said today. 
  Britain was "not enthusiastic" about a policy of extending 
the threat of air strikes, he said. 
  The decision was taken at the NATO summit in Brussels 
yesterday, when alliance leaders also called for United Nations 
commanders to draw up urgent plans to reopen the airport at 
Tuzla for humanitarian relief flights and to get Dutch troops 
into the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica to replace beleaguered 
Canadian peacekeepers. 
  John Major won NATO backing for his plan to bomb the two 
hotspots -- described by his officials as "tactical air support" 
-- after U.S. President Bill Clinton called for readiness to go 
beyond rhetoric in dealing with the Serbs. 
  Mr. Rifkind said today: "One has to be very cautious indeed 
about the use of air power, precisely because of the fact that 
we have forces on the ground. 
  "The primary objective of our forces on the ground -- 
British, French and Canadian -- is to get humanitarian aid 
through. 
  "If their own self-defence or the carrying out of their 
mandate involve some extra means of imposing our will, that has 
to be considered," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 
  The Canadians had expressed great caution about this, he 
said, adding: "We are not enthusiastic about it because there 
have to be very special circumstances." 
  The UN's role was to try to get help through to people who 
needed it. "Whenever there has been action by the Serbs in 
particular, but I am afraid it also applies to the other 
parties, to prevent aid getting through, we have to consider new 
measures, and that includes air power." 
  But he warned: "The purpose of the UN is not to stop this 
war. That cannot be done by some military means from the 
outside. The purpose of the UN is to get aid through." The 
objective was to preserve the lives of tens of thousands of 
innocent lives "caught up in this ghastly conflict," he added.

<F P=106> [Interview with French Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F>
Charles Lambroschini; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Lambroschini] At the NATO summit, everybody once 
again hid behind each other. The Americans want the air strikes 
which Europe is rejecting. The Europeans are demanding an 
American presence on the ground, which Washington is rejecting. 
When and how can we break out of this paralysis? 
  [Leotard] First, I would like to reject the word paralysis. 
It seems unfair to me to say that the UN forces are paralyzed 
when, under very difficult conditions, they are fulfilling their 
mission as defined by the United Nations: in other words the 
escorting of humanitarian convoys. Our soldiers in particular, 
by their self-denial, their behavior, their courage, are 
bringing honor to our country and its finest traditions. 
  It is only thanks to their actions that more than 2 million 
people in Bosnia are being fed. Similarly, I dispute the 
statement that Europe is rejecting air strikes: Instead, it was 
France which, during the vote on Resolution No. 836 establishing 
protected areas, ensured that there was a provision that the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] could resort to air strikes in 
the framework of its mission. 
  In a more general way, France has constantly stepped up its 
diplomatic or military initiatives and advocated a firmer stance 
toward the warring sides. It strengthened its contingent, when 
asked to do so following a European Council meeting in June 
1993. It must be noted that our allies did not follow our 
example. 
  At the NATO summit, France again gave the international 
community a lead in the direction of a firmer stance toward the 
aggressor, including the use of air strikes. And I note that 
our lead was followed, because the summit's final declaration 
takes up the French idea of opening Tuzla airport, by force if 
necessary, and also relieving the Canadian contingent isolated 
by the Serbs in Srebrenica. This is how the UNPROFOR, and hence 
the international community, will restore its credibility. 
  [Lambroschini] On the pretext that the political deadlock 
must be noted and the Blue Helmets withdrawn accordingly, are 
the French and the Europeans not accepting the fait accompli? 
In other words Serbian expansionism? 
  [Leotard] In the present situation, France does not intend 
to withdraw its blue helmets from Bosnia. If the UNPROFOR left, 
Sarajevo would fall tomorrow, the whole of Bosnia would be 
engulfed in flames, humanitarian aid would end, and the conflict 
would be likely to spread to the Balkans. That would be to 
abandon our responsibilities. However, we will not remain in 
Bosnia indefinitely. That is common sense. 
  We must now make every effort to encourage the signing of an 
agreement which establishes the existence of a Bosnian state, 
probably of the confederal type. That is our priority. 
  There is no truly military solution to the conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia. If we failed to end this atrocious war, 
everything we have tried to build since 1945 which would be 
undermined. We are defending a certain concept of man and his 
dignity over there. Our army is not just defending national 
territory, but also an immaterial territory of justice and law, 
a concept of our place in the world, a heritage of values. 
  [Lambroschini] If the withdrawal of the blue helmets is 
being envisaged, ought we not at least to have the courage to 
lift the arms embargo, as the Muslims are demanding? 
  [Leotard] As long as there are men, blue helmets, on the 
ground, the lifting of the arms embargo is the wrong solution. 
Before the Muslims could take advantage of their arms, the 
Serbs, who already have the military means, will have plenty of 
time to defeat their enemy and our positions would be 
untenable.... 
  Let us not forget that it is thanks to the UNPROFOR that 
Sarajevo is still standing. The lifting of the arms embargo 
would therefore, paradoxically, mean first, an intensification 
of the fighting with the resulting civilian casualties, and 
second, a probable victory for the Serbs. We may be forced to 
that point, but, I repeat, it would be the sign of the 
international community's abdication, a desperate solution.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation on Tuesday [11 January] encouraged Russian reforms 
but expressed concern about continuing fighting and instability 
in the republics on Russia's southern rim. 
  In a statement issued at the end of a two-day NATO summit, 
the 16 nations reaffirmed support for political and economic 
reforms pursued by President Boris Yeltsin, despite the 
emergence of a strong challenge from extreme nationalists in the 
new parliament. 
  The December 12 Russian elections and adoption of a new 
constitution conferring executive powers on the president marked 
"a major step forward in the establishment of framework for the 
development of durable democratic institutions. 
  "We further welcome the Russian government's firm commitment 
to democratic and market reform and to a reformist foreign 
policy. These are important for security and stability in 
Europe. We believe that an indepednent, democratic, stable and 
nuclear-weapons free Ukraine would likewise contribute to 
security and stability. 
  "We will continue to encourage and support the reform 
processes in both countries and to develop cooperation with 
them, as with other countries in Central and East Europe," NATO 
said. 
  But the communique went on: "The situation in southern 
Caucasus continues to be of special concern," referring mainly 
to Armenia's bitter territorial struggle with Azerbaijan over 
Armenian-dominated Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  "We condemn the use of force for territorial gains. Respect 
for the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of 
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia is essential to the 
establishment of peace, stability and cooperation in the region." 
  "We call upon all states to join international efforts under 
the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE (Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe) aimed at solving existing 
problems."

<F P=106> [Philippe Marcovici editorial: "Bosnia: NATO's </F>
Gesticulations"] 
  [Text] Under pressure from Paris, supported by several of 
its European allies, Bill Clinton was yesterday forced to 
brandish a threatening stick at the Bosnian Serbs. Against his 
will. The U.S. President did not even want the Bosnian question 
to be included on the agenda of the NATO summit in Brussels. 
What is more: Addressing young Europeans in the Belgian capital 
on Sunday evening [9 January], he did not even deign to mention 
the word Bosnia in his speech. He eventually had to do so, on 
pain of opening up a gulf in the alliance, which he wanted to 
avoid on his first European visit. 
  Amid the wholesale slaughter in Sarajevo, French diplomacy 
has therefore scored a point by forcing the United States to 
abandon its extremely cautious silence. Francois Mitterrand 
undoubtedly wanted to attribute this point to himself by making 
belligerent statements which contrast strangely with what he was 
saying about the former Yugoslavia not so long ago. Everybody 
can change, including Mitterrand and Clinton. However, there is 
reason to wonder about the scope of a change, which essentially 
consists of citing UN Resolution No. 836 on the "security areas" 
adopted last June. And we know what has happened since then. 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who addressed the 
National Assembly Foreign Affairs Commission in Paris yesterday, 
took pleasure in reaffirming this. He reminded the states that 
it is they who could be blamed for refusing to use force. 
Speeches will not change anything, added the UN secretary 
general, who was probably not in a charitable mood. 
  In Brussels, Clinton and Mitterrand chorused that talking 
served no purpose if action did not follow. They will not be 
criticized for saying that. Because they have already talked 
too much, they have contributed -- especially the Americans -- 
to sustaining the Bosnian conflagration rather than 
extinguishing it. By allowing the unfortunate President 
Izetbegovic to believe that a military intervention was 
imminent, they encouraged him to reject all peace plans in 
succession, although the latest ones were consistent with the 
demands previously formulated by the Muslim side. The same 
causes are now likely to produce the same effects.... 
  We will see what will come of the Brussels war drums. How 
can we predict the future after almost two years of almost daily 
contradictions, denials, and about-faces? The United Nations, 
NATO, and Europe have exhausted their credibility in it. They 
have cried wolf one time too many....

<F P=106> [Franz-Olivier Giesbert editorial: "The Tragedy and the </F>
Buck"] 
  [Text] What purpose does NATO serve now that the Cold War 
is dead and buried? Following the Atlantic alliance summit, 
which has just been held in Brussels, it is difficult to answer. 
  NATO, courageous but not reckless, announces in its final 
declaration that it "remains open to other European states" and 
accepts the principle of "expansion." The countries like Poland 
or the Czech Republic, which are knocking at its door, are 
simply asked to wait in the waiting room for as long as is 
necessary. They will learn the pleasures of purgatory. 
  With regard to Bosnia, NATO sententiously decrees that the 
conflict "must be settled at the negotiating table and not on 
the battlefield." How can we fail to agree? And the Sixteen 
are renewing their already long-standing threat of an air strike 
against Serbian positions. But the threats, like the promises, 
primarily commit only those who receive them.... 
  There is a well-known expression: "Stop me or I will do 
something I will regret." This is largely the international 
community's state of mind with regard to the Bosnian tragedy. 
From NATO to the European Union, all the world's institutions 
constantly predict reprisals against the Serbs which never come. 
Like Pontius Pilate, they say: "I am not responsible for this 
blood," wash their hands of it, but never forget, for history's 
sake, to proclaim their indignation by condemning Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
  Thus the "world community" in general, and Europe in 
particular, have brought shame on themselves as they go from one 
step backwards to another. This time, however, it is not 
certain that the worst will happen. As Mr. Mitterrand noted, 
NATO yesterday put forward proposals for practical action 
formulated by Mr. Major and Mr. Juppe together. The aim is to 
launch air strikes to reopen Tuzla airport and clear the 
Srebrenica road. 
  Will the international community finally succeed in 
instilling fear? NATO's distaste lies in having reaffirmed that 
the execution of its threats is dependent on the go-ahead of the 
United Nations which, as things stand, is merely carrying out 
the orders of the UN member states in the conditions on the 
ground about which we know. 
  This is the tactics of discarding. Since the start of the 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia, everybody has been trying to 
pass the buck. Europe regularly turns toward the United States 
which then demands the intervention of the Twelve. Hitherto 
they have both always managed not to agree at the same time on 
the need for military intervention. They thought they were 
taking people in. 
  NATO is now addressing the United Nations which can do 
nothing about it. What if the United Nations said: "You are 
on?"

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 11 (AFP) -- Red Cross and Red Crescent 
societies need 318.5 million Swiss francs (212.5 million 
dollars) to carry out their long-term emergency operations this 
year, their federation said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  Launching the appeal, the federation said the funds are 
needed to plan and finance humanitarian aid to some 13.2 million 
people in 46 countries. 
  "With the end of the Cold War disasters of all kinds have 
become more frequent and more complex, affecting a growing 
number of people whose already precarious situation gets worse 
each year," said Secretary-General Georges Weber. 
  Europe and in particular the former Yugoslavia, the Caucasus 
and states that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union 
head the list of targets, requiring 200 million francs to aid 
8.6 million people. 
  In Africa the federation will need 90 million francs to 
finance its operations for three million people in 16 countries. 
  "With this appeal we must address the daily needs of the 
victims of forgotten disasters -- disasters which are often more 
devastating, more long term and more related to violent conflict 
than natural disaster," said Stephen Davey, under-secretary 
general for operations.

  [Text] Butrus-Ghali, the UN secretary general who is 
visiting France, said he was in favor of air strikes in Bosnia 
if the men on the ground requested it. Butrus-Ghali was 
interviewed by Luc Lemonnier after having been heard by the 
Senate and before being received by Balladur in his office: 
  [Begin recording] [Butrus-Ghali] I think that the 
resolutions 
that have been adopted will allow the use of air strikes [in 
Bosnia]. We have no difficulty. Once those who are responsible 
for military operations, humanitarian operations, and political 
operations have asked or decided to use air strikes, we will 
immediately ask NATO to use air strikes. I must stress that, so 
far, I have never received any request for the use of air 
strikes. The day I receive such a request -- and I have the 
support of the military in charge of humanitarian operations and 
in charge of negotiations, considering the use of air strike as 
urgent -- I will be the first to support the use of air strikes.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
Franz-Olivier Giesbert, Jacques Jacquet-Francillon, and Charles 
Lambroschini on 11 January 1994 in Paris: "Following the NATO 
Summit, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali Said to LE FIGARO: `I 
Shall Not Hesitate To Use Air Strikes in Bosnia'" -- first two 
paragraphs are LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] According to Mr. Butrus-Ghali, the attitude of the 
states involved has changed: "There is a genuine political will 
to take action." However, in the face of all the various 
conflicts around the world, he notes "a certain fatigue within 
the international community." 
  Yesterday, in an exclusive interview with LE FIGARO, UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali expressed his satisfaction 
with the conclusions of the NATO summit regarding Bosnia. 
Visiting Paris, Mr. Butrus-Ghali, who had just held talks with 
Defense Minister Francois Leotard, thanked France "for 
contributing so much to the UN peacekeeping forces." France, 
with 8,000 men in the former Yugoslavia, is the country which 
has deployed the largest contingent of UN troops. 
  [LE FIGARO] NATO has just renewed its threat of air strikes 
in Bosnia. Are these constant threats of intervention in Bosnia 
by all the international institutions not becoming rather 
laughable? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I carefully read the NATO press release 
before 
answering your questions, and I think that, to be fair, there is 
a change of attitude on the part of the states involved, and 
that there is a genuine political will to take action. 
Consequently, I am rather optimistic. People are now demanding 
specifically that ways be found to open the airfield at Tuzla 
and ensure the rotation [of UN peacekeeping troops] in 
Srebrenica. 
  [LE FIGARO] With what in mind? NATO has always said that; 
everyone has always said that. The ball is being passed around 
between Europe and the United States, with one or the other not 
wishing to intervene, explaining that this is due to the 
other.... The United States is calling for air strikes, while 
Europe is talking rather of intervention on the ground.... The 
whole thing will take months to decide. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, I am telling you. My commentary is based 
solely on the press release. Compared with other press 
releases, this press release is, to my mind, more positive, and 
expresses a political will to take action. 
  [LE FIGARO] What about the UN troops in the event of air 
strikes? What will you do with them? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Should we ever have air strikes, they will be 
decided by the political authority, and we will have to accept 
the risks involved. 
  [LE FIGARO] Will the UN troops have to be withdrawn at that 
moment? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, not necessarily. The air strikes would be 
specifically targeted, occurring only in certain places. 
  [LE FIGARO] If the time comes, who will make the decision? 
Do you have the power to do so by invoking the resolutions 
already adopted by the UN Security Council? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It is the political authority that must 
decide. I was given a mandate, but I also need a request by my 
special representative for the former Yugoslavia, Mr. Yasushi 
Akashi [name as published], who will himself have heard the 
views and opinions of the military leaders on the ground, of the 
co-chairman of the steering committee of the International 
Conference on Yugoslavia, Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg, and of those 
in charge of the humanitarian action. 
  [LE FIGARO] These men being your representatives? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly. And in the event of a positive 
verdict, I shall not hesitate to use air strikes to contribute 
to the restoration of peace. 
  [LE FIGARO] Using whose air force? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] In principle, NATO's. However, I have no 
authority over NATO. If NATO decides not to use force, then I 
will be powerless to oblige them. 
  [LE FIGARO] When you say that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] has to look into how Tuzla airport could be opened, is 
this not another way of putting things off, because surely all 
the necessary studies have been made since we have been talking 
about Tuzla and Srebrenica as safe areas? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We have not managed to implement this 
decision 
because we did not receive the 8,000 soldiers necessary. This 
decision was adopted in May. Now it is January, and we have 
only had about 1,000 more soldiers, who were sent by France. We 
need another 7,000 troops and are still negotiating with the 
states concerned with a view to obtaining these soldiers. It is 
a case of a physical impossibility. According to our military 
experts, we would need 8,000 more soldiers to take care of these 
safe areas, this being a minimum number, for we could also do 
with more men. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you lack the soldiers to relieve those in 
Srebrenica and open Tuzla airport? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] There, we are envisioning an air strike. I 
cannot go into details on the basis of the press release. I 
will be meeting with all my specialists and with representatives 
of the military in Geneva either today or tomorrow with a view 
to seeing exactly what we can do. 
  [LE FIGARO] The problem with these threats by the 
international community is that the Serbs do not believe them. 
They feel that we are acting in this way to make ourselves feel 
better and ease our conscience. All the international 
institutions, starting with NATO, are being accused of hypocrisy. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The only comment I can make, having followed 
these debates and been in contact with the responsible 
individuals here in France -- and tomorrow, in Geneva, I shall 
continue my contacts with the people in charge -- is that there 
is a new political will to take action. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you sense that the French, for example, are 
determined to see this thing through to the end? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Do not make me say such things. See this 
thing through to the end? No. However, I am saying that there 
is a new political will and, reading the NATO press release, my 
impression is it contains something new. There is a new 
political will, because something has to be done, although it 
has taken us too long to reach this stage. 
<H5>  Transition </H5>
  [LE FIGARO] When you talk of air strikes, which you appear 
to 
think might be a possibility in Tuzla or Srebrenica, what does 
that mean? Does it mean that UN people are going to say to the 
Serbs: "Let us into this airport or let us relieve the forces in 
Srebrenica? If you do not do so within such-and-such period of 
time, then we will send in the air force." Is that what it 
means? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I do not know. I have no idea about that. I 
cannot make any further comment. 
  [LE FIGARO] What does "air strike" mean? Technically 
speaking, within what time frame? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I have no idea. The only thing I can tell you 
is that I think a new political will was expressed in Brussels 
at a conference which ended one hour ago. How will this be 
applied in practice? What difficulties will arise? I cannot 
say. I must first consult the technicians. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is what is at stake in Bosnia, like in Somalia, 
not the very principle of what is called the humanitarian war? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, I think that the real problem, in both 
Somalia and Bosnia, is that the states involved are not ready to 
send the necessary troops, that they are not ready to allocate 
the financial resources required for these operations, and that 
there is a certain fatigue dogging the international community 
as a result of being faced with these various conflicts. 
  [LE FIGARO] Something about the system of organizing UN 
troops is tainted, namely that people are being sent to the 
firing line without being authorized to fire a shot. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Let us be realistic. There is absolutely no 
point in my talking of shifting up a gear when I realize that 
the states concerned do not want to do so. It is a question of 
not throwing ideas around if it will mean you losing your 
credibility.... 
  [LE FIGARO] Are we very far away from having a world 
government? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I am entirely in favor of having one, but we 
are very far from achieving this. Moreover, I do not even know 
if it is in the interest of the international community to have 
a world government. 
  I would present the problem from a different angle: In 1815 
there was the Congress of Vienna; in 1919 the Treaty of 
Versailles; in 1945, San Francisco, and even Luxembourg. And 
then...when the Cold War ended, there was no international 
conference. So we are making no progress. We are going through 
a difficult time, a period of transition. 
  [LE FIGARO] That is a reproach. Do you really think that an 
international conference should have been held after the Berlin 
Wall came down? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I am merely saying that this is complicating 
the situation. The transition period will last longer because 
we do not know what the new standards are, what the new system 
is, or the new balance of power. 
  What role do the states concerned want to confer on the 
United Nations in this new, post-Cold War system? 
  My conclusion after serving two years as the UN secretary 
general is that the states have not yet reached a decision on 
this subject. Why? Because they themselves do not know what the 
new balance of power is, nor what new system should govern 
international relations. 
  That is where we are for now.

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner at </F>
NATO headquarters in Brussels by Paul Burkhalter in the 3SAT 
studio in Mainz on 11 January--recorded] 
  [Text] [Burkhalter] Mr. Woerner, Partnership for Peace is 
the magic formula for the Central and East European states. 
However, it does not give a timeframe, nor is there any talk 
about security guarantees. I would say there is too little meat 
on the bones. 
  [Woerner] On the contrary, Mr. Burkhalter. There is a lot 
of meat on the bones -- concrete military and political 
cooperation, to include consultations in crises. This means a 
lot. It means that their security will also be strengthened 
through such cooperation. But, of course, there are not yet 
security guarantees. This does not mean, however, that we would 
remain passive in case they were attacked. 
  [Burkhalter] Mr. Woerner, Russia plays a special role in 
NATO's considerations. Reduced to a formula, I would say -- 
neither NATO together with Russia, nor NATO against Russia. 
What is Russia to NATO? 
  [Woerner] Oh yes, Russia is a very important partner, with 
whom we are seeking a special partnership, including a strategic 
partnership. What we want is to build a greater Europe, a 
Euro-Atlantic community with the Russians, so that they do not 
have to feel excluded or even surrounded. What we are doing is 
a great historic attempt to include them. However, we do not 
allow anyone to dictate to us to whom we should extend the 
alliance. 
  [Burkhalter] What exactly do you mean by include, Mr. 
Woerner? 
  [Woerner] What we mean by this is that we will not only 
build such a Europe with them, but we will also make decisions 
following close consultations and discussions with them. 
  [Burkhalter] Polish President Lech Walesa demanded that NATO 
should test Russia's credibility. 
  [Woerner] Well, this is his formulation; I would put it 
differently. I would say we expect the Russians not only to 
respect human rights at home but also their neighbors' 
sovereignty. Such cooperative behavior, or -- to put it this 
way -- such respect for the neighbors' sovereignty and their 
intention not to pursue hegemonic objectives again, are 
certainly prerequisites and preconditions for fruitful 
cooperation with NATO. 
  [Burkhalter] But such conditions do not yet exist. 
  [Woerner] Well, some people there are using language we do 
not like to hear. I hope they will moderate their language. By 
the way -- the coarser the language in Moscow, the more they 
will drive some Central and East European states into NATO's 
arms. 
  [Burkhalter] A few words on NATO's stance on the Bosnian 
conflict, Mr. Woerner. Some NATO members are audibly thinking 
about air raids against Serbian positions, and the U.S. side has 
said -- I quote -- that one is ready to consider attacks, if the 
siege of Sarajevo and the situation justify this. Is this not a 
slap in the face to the people who are being killed there in a 
war that has lasted for two years now? 
  [Woerner] Do not forget that we depend on the United 
Nations. We can only do what the United Nations has mandated us 
to do, and we have carried out that mission swiftly and 
efficiently. We have now offered to use our air power if 
Sarajevo or other cities are strangulated, or if Srebenica is 
blocked. But here, too, we depend on the approval of the United 
Nations and on the opinion of the UNPROFOR troops in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  [Burkhalter] This means that NATO is now embarking on a 
tougher course. 
  [Woerner] The current mood here and the much greater 
determination among NATO members indicate at least that things 
cannot continue. This is what I felt last night when I had a 
very detailed talk over dinner with the heads of state and 
chiefs of government. Let us hope that this determination is 
followed by deeds. We would like to see the responsible people 
take notice of these signals, so that we do not have to take 
such measures. 
  [Burkhalter] Mr. Woerner, I thank you very much for this 
interview.

  [Text] Mr. Major revealed he will travel to Moscow to meet 
President Boris Yeltsin in the next few weeks in addition to 
plans to visit Washington late next month. 
  "It is very important to build up our relationship with the 
democratic leaders in Russia as well as Central and East 
Europe," he said. 
  "They are our friends. They have new and democratic 
institutions and they have liberalised their economies. 
  "Russia has a hugely important part to play in the world. 
The relationship between Russia and NATO can only be to the 
benefit of both sides. We have been seeking at this meeting to 
build a stable framework for the most profound changes in modern 
history." 
  Mr. Major went to meet NATO military chiefs, including the 
Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General George Joulwan, and the 
chairman of the Military Committee, Field Marshal Sir Dick 
Vincent. 
  He wanted to hear their advice about what action was 
feasible 
in Bosnia and how the summit's decisions to open NATO doors to 
the East could be implemented.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 11 (AFP) -- France emphasized Tuesday 
[11 January] that NATO was poised for tough action in Bosnia 
including possible use of air power to support UN troops there 
regardless of opposition from Serb troops or other warring 
parties. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the most pressing 
task at hand was to reopen the airport in the northeast Bosnian 
city of Tuzla for use as a delivery point for UN humanitarian 
aid. 
  "Today we have decided to go there despite the refusal of 
the 
Serbs," Juppe told reporters here at the close of a two-day 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) summit. 
  "It's not a question of launching preventive or offensive 
air 
strikes, but we are setting up at the Tuzla airport so that it 
will function and we warn that...if obstacles appear there will 
be a riposte," Juppe said. 
  The French minister's remarks were the strongest 
interpretation among Western officials of the summit's call to 
UN troop commanders urgently to draft contingency plans for NATO 
action at Tuzla and the eastern city of Srbrenica. 
  The decision, contained in the summit's final communique, 
also aimed to ensure that some 300 Canadian UN troops in 
Srbrenica for the past six months currently being blocked by 
Serb forces from leaving were immediately permitted to do so. 
  French President Francois Mitterrand stressed NATO's 
"determination to eliminate obstacles" preventing the UN 
Protection Force from accomplishing its mission in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "We can no longer count on the goodwill of the three warring 
parties and the first duty of the United Nations forces is to 
ensure the safety of their comrades engaged in peacekeeping 
activities," Mitterrand said. 
  "That will be the case in Srebrenica and at Tuzla airport," 
he added. 
  The proposal for action at Tuzla and Srebrenica was put 
forward jointly by Britain and France, but Paris has in recent 
weeks taken the lead -- despite U.S. misgivings -- for NATO to 
prepare for tougher military action in Bosnia to support UN 
troops. 
  Mitterrand said the wording of the passage on Bosnia 
included 
in the final communique had been drawn up by British Prime 
Minister John Major and Juppe and was checked by U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher. 
  A French official, who asked not to be named, said earlier 
that Christopher had telephoned Juppe on the eve of the summit 
and had urged Paris not to press the Tuzla-Srebrenica plan at 
the summit. 
  Mitterrand refused to specify what kind of action was 
envisaged, saying that it was "not usual" to make such 
information available for security reasons. 
  Last August NATO announced it would resort to air strikes to 
protect UN troops on the ground and in Moslem safe areas if the 
United Nations formally requested it.

  [Excerpt] At the NATO summit in Brussels, the Atlantic 
alliance has threatened again to use air power in Bosnia 
following the initiative of the French and the British. In 
concrete terms, the aim is to prevent the strangulation of 
Sarajevo and to unblock Srebrenica, as well as Tuzla airport. 
Laurent Boussie reports: 
  [Boussie] The French are satisfied. Bosnia, which was not on 
the agenda of this summit, was in fact at the core of the talks. 
The signature of the Americans, their commitment to support the 
European peace plan, the contribution by the 16 countries of the 
alliance to the implementation of this plan, and their support 
to the United Nations for its action in Bosnia are all positive 
elements that were not on the agenda at the beginning of this 
summit. 
  There is a firm commitment behind these diplomatic gestures: 
In two specific cases, Srebrenica and Tuzla, the use of force is 
not only being considered, it is almost planned. 
  [Begin Juppe recording] The Twelve of the European Union 
[EU] 
have requested it [?the use of force] on several occasions, and 
I did the same myself strongly when I met Mr. Karadzic in 
Geneva, and later on in Brussels; the Serbs have refused. We 
are now deciding to go ahead all the same. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Press statement by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl given in </F>
Brussels on 11 January on the results of the NATO summit held on 
10-11 January--recorded] 
  [Text] [Passage indistinct] Regarding the individual 
results I should like to highlight the following: 
  Firstly, the extremely open and amicable atmosphere of the 
talks was most remarkable. The basis of the alliance is and 
remains the firm security link between North America and Europe. 
President Clinton expressly reaffirmed the further concrete 
presence of U.S. soldiers in Europe, and this was highlighted as 
being particularly important by all participants at the talks. 
At the same time, the alliance supports without reservation the 
emergence of a European identity in terms of security and 
defense, as stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty. 
  The Western European Union will, in future, be able to rely 
on NATO resources for independent operations, and these 
decisions were taken in full agreement with our American 
partners. The central questions were the restructuring of our 
relations with the countries of Central, East and southeastern 
Europe, as well as the successor states of the Soviet Union. 
During the dramatic years of transition in these countries the 
people have looked to the West for support. We have repeatedly 
encouraged the reform states to introduce democracy and the 
market economy. That means in consequence that we have to do 
everything we can to support these processes. In addition, we 
cannot allow these people to feel that they have to live in a 
gray zone in terms of security. We Germans, appreciate 
particularly keenly the worries of our neighboring countries. 
For this reason we want to deepen political and military 
cooperation with these countries in order to build a new 
relationship which results in a Partnership for Peace. 
  At the same time, this conference in Brussels has sent a 
clear signal that NATO is open to new members in future. The 
Partnership for Peace, based on practical and concrete measures, 
goes well beyond mere dialogue. For example, there will be 
joint exercises, perhaps as early as this year, as well as joint 
training for participation in international peace missions. 
  A decisive element of the partnership program is the offer 
to 
engage in consultations with partners if they fear a direct 
threat to their territorial integrity, political independence, 
or security. For the German Government, invitations and programs 
connected with the Partnership for Peace are not diplomatic 
cliches but a very seriously step, a dynamic process on the way 
to later NATO membership. We are of course aware that, in the 
present situation, it is not possible to name a concrete date. 
  We also do not want to and must not open up any new rifts in 
Europe. The security and stability of our continent is 
indivisible. This means that we want to build a close 
partnership, above all with Russia and Ukraine, in order to 
create jointly a security system for the whole of Europe. In 
order to create a peaceful future for Europe, it is vitally 
important that existing borders are not violated and the rights 
of minorities are protected. Therefore, the summit has welcomed 
unanimously the initiative of the European Union for a stability 
pact in Europe as an important ingredient in promoting security 
and stability. 
  Yesterday we discussed very intensively the situation in 
Russia, and not just prior to President Clinton's visit here. 
The performance of extremist forces at the recent elections is a 
serious warning signal, not only for the Russian leadership, but 
for all of us. We agreed that, notwithstanding the justified 
concern about this development, we must not allow ourselves to 
be deflected from continuing to support the reform policies in 
Russia and also President Yeltsin's reform policies. 
  During our talks we gave a lot of attention to the war in 
former Yugoslavia. A great tragedy is unwinding before our very 
eyes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The summit has again called on the 
warring parties to put an end to violence and to solve the 
problems at the negotiating table. This also includes the 
efforts made over the past few days in Bonn that unfortunately 
did not lead to the hoped-for breakthrough between Croatia and 
Bosnia. My colleague Klaus Kinkel will tell you about this when 
I have finished. 
  NATO unanimously supports the peace efforts of the United 
Nations and the European Union. This includes the determination 
of NATO to enforce the UN mandate through air strikes if 
necessary. At the suggestion of our colleagues from Great 
Britain, France, and Canada, following the talks yesterday 
evening, the following urgent requests to the United Nations 
have been incorporated in the summit communique: Firstly, the 
urgent work and plans required to secure the replacement of the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] contingent in Srebrenica provided 
by Canada to date, and secondly, to examine how Tuzla airport 
can be opened for humanitarian relief operations. 
  Furthermore, I would like to point out that with regard to 
other subjects, NATO has reaffirmed its readiness to support the 
international peace missions of the United Nations and the CSCE. 
A new element here is the offer to European non-NATO members to 
take part in such missions; I will cite Sweden and Finland here. 
Secondly, NATO intends to adapt and change its leadership 
structures so that it can greatly improve its expanded 
cooperation with the Western European Union and its support for 
international missions. Thirdly, NATO is increasing its 
political and defense efforts against the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  I would like to stress, in particular, that this two-day 
meeting in Brussels has shown me how much NATO as a whole and 
the European Union complement each other in their efforts to 
help safeguard peace and freedom and bring about security and 
stability in Europe. Over to my colleague, Herr Kinkel.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jason Moskovitz from Brussels on </F>
the NATO summit, including recorded comments by Canadian Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien and Canadian Foreign Minister Andre 
Ouellet] 
  [Text] The NATO summit in Brussels has ended with a stern 
warning to Bosnian Serbs. NATO is considering air strikes 
unless Serb forces stop blocking United Nations peacekeeping 
operations. NATO is asking the United Nations to draw up 
contingency plans for this purpose. The warning in the summit's 
final communique comes after the Allies resolved differences 
among themselves. 
  Canada had said the threat might put the lives of its 
peacekeepers in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica at risk. 
Jason Moskovitz reports from Brussels. 
  [Moskovitz] In less than 24 hours the Canadian position on 
air strikes has shifted significantly. Andre Ouellet, the 
foreign minister, was unequivocal yesterday against. He said 
air strikes could endanger the lives of Canadian peacekeepers. 
  [Ouellet] [recording begins mid-sentence] ....believe that 
our soldiers that are there could be in serious danger if there 
is bombing. In fact it could kill soldiers. 
  [Moskovitz] Today Prime Minister Jean Chretien says the 
Serbs 
must let Canadian soldiers be replaced in Srebrenica or face 
possible air strikes. 
  [Chretien] They cannot move. It so happens at this moment 
that the Canadians cannot be replaced in Srebrenica by the Dutch 
soldiers, and we are telling them that the time has come to 
allow their replacement. 
  [Moskovitz] Should there be air strikes, the prime minister 
was asked what measures would be taken to protect Canadian 
soldiers. 
  [Chretien] If my grandmother had wheels, she would have been 
a bus, as Mr. Trudeau used to say. So I, you know, if, I am 
telling you madame [addressing news conference] clearly that the 
condition for air strikes does not exist today [sentence as 
heard]. They might exist eventually, but they do not exist 
today. 
  [Moskovitz] Canadian officials appeared caught off guard 
with 
the tough language of the final communique. In regard to the 
Canadian position, yesterday was yesterday, today is today.

  [Text] Stockholm, Jan 12 (AFP) -- The Swedish and French 
defence ministers discussed Wednesday [12 January] the use of 
military means to reopen the airport at Tuzla in northern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina following a statement by UN chief Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali that force might be justified. 
  Anders Bjoerck and Francois Leotard told a press conference 
that they were agreed on the need for "rather determined 
methods" to reopen the airport, which has been closed to air 
traffic since the beginning of the Bosnian conflict and which is 
needed for the supply of humanitarian relief. 
  On Tuesday the UN secretary general said he would approve 
the 
use of air power in Bosnia-Herzegovina if United Nations 
personnel on the ground called for it. 
  The two defence ministers said they had agreed on other 
"concrete proposals" that they could not for the moment reveal. 
  "We must not make threats without being able to implement 
them," Leotard said. 
  He said the ministers had discussed "the hundreds of Serb 
guns hidden around Sarajevo and in several villages" and the 
danger for UN troops and Bosnian civilians in the event that 
military action was taken. 
  Bosnia's separatist Serbs, who have surrounded Sarajevo and 
held it under siege, with daily bombardments, for the past 21 
months, have dismissed the likelihood of international military 
action, pointing to previous threats to use force that have not 
been followed up.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Loic Bouvard, president of the North Atlantic </F>
Assembly, member of the Union for French Democracy, and vice 
president of the French National Assembly: "A Historic NATO 
Summit?"] 
  [Text] Nations which have demonstrated their willingness to 
join the democratic club should not be kept out of the alliance 
-- but Russia must not be isolated. 
  Did the heads of states and governments who gathered in 
Brussels over the last few days on the occasion of the reputedly 
"historic" NATO summit rise to the occasion? It is worth 
repeating that the summit was first and foremost a test for the 
U.S. Administration, on whose initiative it had been convened. 
This was an opportunity for the United States to disclose its 
"vision" of a European policy which seemingly had fallen by the 
wayside since Bill Clinton came to power a year ago. The 
imaginative and concrete proposals brought to the summit by the 
Americans bear witness to a genuine commitment to their 
responsibilities. To Central and East European countries which 
have been fearing the consequences of an overly exclusive focus 
on Russia, they offered a Partnership for Peace. To West 
Europeans, they offered a possibility to carry out independent 
actions using NATO resources. 
<H5>  Central Europe </H5>
  European partners of the United States within NATO, 
including 
France, were appreciative of this American effort at rethinking 
NATO. But will statements made at the summit be enough to 
appease Western skeptics -- for whom the alliance is an obsolete 
relic of the Cold War -- and Eastern skeptics -- who, on the 
contrary, view it as a promise of stability and peace for the 
future? 
  Everything will hinge on the way the decisions made in 
Brussels are implemented. If it helps Central and East European 
countries in transforming their military structures, if it 
harmonizes their defense capabilities with those of NATO, if it 
lays the foundation for joint operations, if it contributes to 
the necessary renewal of attitudes within post-Soviet military 
institutions, the Partnership for Peace will have done more for 
its intended beneficiaries than grand statements or promises of 
assistance which no one will feel constrained to keep. 
Nevertheless, nations which have demonstrated that they are 
willing and able to join the democratic club should not be kept 
out of the alliance. 
  For Central and East European countries, and especially 
would-be members of the European Union, the Partnership for 
Peace must lead to full integration into the alliance. 
Confining these countries to the sidelines for a long time 
would only undermine the faith their governments and citizens 
have placed in the values of democracy and free enterprise, and 
would create a zone of instability which would one day bring 
grief to the whole of Europe. 
  While it is essential to avoid making Central Europe feel 
ignored, it is just as crucial to avoid isolating Russia. 
Should Russia come to feel cornered, it not only would become 
far less predictable, but would also accumulate colossal 
resentment against the West. Convinced of Western malevolence 
toward it, it would undoubtedly attempt to recreate a buffer 
zone through reasserting control over neighboring countries. Of 
course, its support at the UN Security Council, which alliance 
countries have managed to benefit so much from over the past few 
years, would also be lost. 
  The experience of post-World War II Germany shows that the 
best way to turn a former foe into an ally is not to humiliate 
or ostracize it, but to bring it into the game after drawing up 
strict rules by which it is expected to play. While Central 
European countries must be given firm assurances of future NATO 
membership, it is just as crucial to get Russia to commit itself 
within a strong security partnership. The Partnership for Peace 
makes this possible. It does not prevent integration into NATO 
to happen at varying dates depending on the country. On the 
contrary, it facilitates such a notion. It is up to each 
partner to show, through active participation, how determined it 
is to join the alliance. 
  Indeed, the guise NATO is most likely to assume in the 
future is that of an alliance "a la carte." The types of 
interventions which NATO will have to carry out in the years to 
come, whether on its own initiative or under a mandate from 
broader-based collective security organizations, will require 
flexibility and interoperability of forces rather than permanent 
integration of such forces. After a long period of indecision, 
the U.S. Government has now acknowledged the consequences of 
such a situation by bringing to the table the notion of 
"combined joint task forces." Such forces, which would have the 
ability of pulling apart from the integrated structure, could be 
deployed under WEU [Western European Union] command for 
interventions which the United States would be unwilling to take 
part in. 
<H5>  Bosnia </H5>
  This approach is congruent with French aspirations, as 
France 
would like the European Union to assume responsibility for 
conflicts which affect continental security. France will be 
ready to participate fully as soon as command and control 
procedures are defined to its satisfaction. Of course, it is 
clear that NATO must keep the upper hand wherever the Americans 
are willing to commit themselves. 
  So significant progress has been achieved for items on the 
agenda. However, political enlargement and the reform of the 
alliance's military structure will be credible only if NATO 
demonstrates an ability to take concrete action when a conflict 
breaks out on the continent. The summit's agenda did not 
include the situation in the former Yugoslavia. France 
correctly sought to remedy this by asking its allies to give 
explicit support to the European Union's peace plan, and asking 
NATO to renew its commitment to the implementation of UN 
resolutions. Indeed, how can one remain passive while innocent 
civilians are being slaughtered every day in Sarajevo and other 
besieged Bosnian cities? More than once, the U.S. authorities 
threatened the Serbs with armed reprisals, only to back down 
thereafter. The Europeans, although primarily concerned with 
the safety of their blue helmets, are increasingly reluctant to 
bear the humiliation of being constrained not to use force. 
  For the alliance, averting its eye from Yugoslavia would be 
akin to abdicating its very purpose. Indeed, its current 
relevance will be judged by its determination to intervene, 
militarily if necessary, to uphold the principles of freedom, 
democracy and law.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Pierre Lefevre: "The Atlantic Alliance's New </F>
Balances"] 
  [Text] The NATO summit has left the impression of harmony 
among the members of the organization, which has not been seen 
for a long time. Indeed, at their Brussels meeting, the Sixteen 
found a series of balances which are promising for the Atlantic 
alliance's future. They also largely cleared up two major 
misunderstandings that could have clouded their future 
relations: The action to be taken in Bosnia and opening up the 
alliance to new members. 
  First, there is a Euro-American balance. Bill Clinton fully 
recognized the political dimension of the European Union 
acquired by the Maastricht Treaty and the role which the Twelve 
intend to give themselves in the security and defense sphere. 
Speaking of a "new spirit" in transatlantic relations, Francois 
Mitterrand said: "The consent wrested from the Americans in Rome 
(in 1991) with regard to recognizing the European defense 
identity seemed perfectly natural in Brussels.... Distrust has 
been replaced by great mutual confidence." 
  The U.S. President, for his part, did not seem to use this 
affirmation of European identity to dissociate himself from the 
"Old Continent." He promised to leave 100,000 men there -- a 
sign of the strategic importance which Europe continues to have 
in the Americans' view. Moreover, he seems to be really 
involving himself in the fight for the continent's integration, 
including Russia, and is even taking the lead in it. The 
determination with which he defended his Partnership for Peace 
plan clearly demonstrates this. 
  In this respect, too, NATO found a degree of balance between 
the expectations of the Central European countries and Russia's 
fears. Although the link between the Partnership and NATO 
membership remains unofficial, it was reaffirmed that the 
neighboring countries of Central Europe can have a fairly clear 
prospect of future club membership. British Prime Minister John 
Major moreover explicitly mentioned Poland, Hungary, and the 
Czech Republic. That was no accident. German Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe, the most ardent advocate of NATO's expansion 
within the German Government and the most skeptical about the 
Partnership for Peace plan, yesterday described the summit as a 
"great success" and said that it offered Germany's eastern 
neighbors "a clear prospect of membership." This did not 
prevent Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev from seeing it 
as "a step in the right direction." 
  Finally, with regard to Bosnia, NATO unanimously adopted a 
very measured stance. The threat of air strikes against Tuzla 
and Srebrenica is a "tactical" use of the stick, mid-way between 
a purely verbal threat and the risk of escalation which the 
announcement of an intervention in Sarajevo could, for instance, 
prompt. It is a calculated risk but one which, at least for the 
time being, safeguards NATO's credibility. 
  Even more significantly, France and Britain, which last year 
were strongly opposed to the American idea of air strikes, 
rallied round to it while the United States, hitherto critical 
of the Europeans' conciliatory approach, finally gave approval 
to the Twelve's plan to try and secure a peace agreement.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Paul De Bruyn: "NATO Finds a New Balance"] </F>
  [Text] The NATO summit closed on a note of great 
satisfaction. This was the meeting which not only had to set a 
new course and iron out recent friction between the Europeans 
and the Americans, but above all make a fundamental opening to 
the East, offering Central and East European countries the 
prospect of future membership. 
  The alliance knew that it was at a turning point, and just 
as 
it has always been at its most creative when its existence has 
been in doubt, once again it seems to have administered itself a 
booster -- which will be much needed for a long time to come. 
The message was unanimous: NATO remains the best guarantee for 
security in Europe. 
  Following the often underlying mutual criticism, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton urged the alliance to find a new balance 
between Europe and the United States and seems to have made a 
great step forward in doing so. The "new" NATO will have much 
more of a European flavor. It has provided a stronger than ever 
response to the demands of the Europeans to construct a fully 
fledged European pillar. Never before has the alliance so 
clearly expressed its support for a European defense and 
security identity or established what role the European Union 
can play in the European security structure. 
  Although the old U.S. demand for "burden sharing" (the 
sharing of costs) is no doubt still present, Clinton has a very 
different approach to European unification than his predecessor 
George Bush, who distrusted the process and tried to slow it 
down. Clinton has repeatedly made it known that it is in both 
the United States' and Europe's interest for Europe to assume a 
greater role. Now that NATO has made its resources available to 
operations by the Western European Union -- among other things 
through the use of combined joint task forces, in which it 
neither wants to nor is able to participate itself -- the 
Europeans will have to show they are ready for the role. 
  At the same time, the U.S. leadership will not be 
compromised 
in any way. It is an old truth that the alliance only works 
well under clear U.S. leadership. In this respect, there was 
general relief in Brussels that Washington remains fully 
committed to its obligations and that Clinton is even pulling 
the alliance along behind him. Nobody makes any secret of the 
fact that this was very much "Clinton's summit." The dominant 
themes -- the new balance, enlargement to the East, and halting 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons -- were all Clinton's 
themes. 
  The question yet to be answered is to what extent they will 
work. In particular, doubts hang over the Partnership for Peace 
which is designed to draw closer to NATO the candidate members 
from Central and East Europe. NATO admits that this proposal 
does not give these countries what they are seeking: security 
guarantees against a Russian threat. By inviting them to 
participate in military cooperation or peace missions, NATO 
hopes to prepare them for full membership at some time in the 
future. 
  There is no longer any discussion on the principle of 
expanding the alliance. Everyone agrees that this will happen. 
Nobody, however, ventures to say how and which countries will 
be the first to be considered for membership. Not all the 
candidate countries will be able to join at once. This would, 
however, mean that some countries (Romania, Bulgaria) will have 
to remain behind in a Russian-dominated zone which is something 
NATO cannot allow. New dividing lines in Europe are not 
acceptable. It is uncertain whether the Partnership for Peace 
will be able to solve this problem. For internal reasons, it is 
the best NATO can offer itself: it postpones the painful 
decision. For this fact alone, the summit has been a success. 
  But this success is tempered by the continuing failure on 
one 
subject: Bosnia. However much the alliance may want to 
reorganize itself, it stands or falls by its credibility, which 
has been seriously damaged in Bosnia. Threatening language 
cannot restore it. NATO's worth is determined only by its 
ability to implement its policy. Further empty threats would 
further damage its prestige and finally create nothing but a 
profound general malaise.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Michel Rosten: "The American Double Gamble"] </F>
  [Text] The 13th NATO summit has ended in Brussels and the 
Americans have secured what they wanted: an agreement from their 
allies on the implementation of the Partnership for Peace. 
Objectively, this is real progress compared with the 
establishment of NACC (North Atlantic Cooperation Council), 
whose creation aimed to fill the political and military gap 
created by the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact and the collapse 
of communism. 
  We can, therefore, now be certain that real cooperation will 
be established on the European Continent, even if the prospects 
offered by the Partnership remain vague. The terms of the final 
communique leave no room for doubt: The expansion of the 
alliance is within the realm of possiblity and has been 
announced, although no timetable has been established. Compared 
with the intentions expressed in autumn, this is considerable 
progress. 
  Of course, some people rightly think that this development 
is 
not rapid enough. The Central European countries in particular, 
whose heads of state will meet with Bill Clinton in Prague this 
Wednesday [12 January], will probably regret that the alliance 
has not taken more account of their hopes. But the choices made 
in Washington at the initiative of Strobe Talbott, the new 
assistant secretary of state (a former journalist who was posted 
to Moscow), show that the White House's European policy is 
determined to do nothing which could jeopardize Boris Yeltsin's 
reforms. 
  On the other hand -- diplomatic circles make no secret of 
this -- if things turn out badly in Russia, it seems obvious 
that the Central or even East European countries would receive 
their membership without delay. In such conditions, the Western 
countries would no longer allow themselves to give in to the 
amoral temptation of isolationism: They would have to provide 
the security guarantees which Prague, Warsaw, and Budapest are 
asking of them. 
  Paradoxically, as an expert stressed, the worst thing to 
happen -- which nobody wants -- would favor the aspirations of 
the members of the Visegrad group.... 
  In short, the U.S. Administration is taking a kind of 
gamble. 
It wishes to play on two stages at once. Assured of the 
rapprochement of the countries naturally attracted by the 
Western world and which have no choice but to accept the 
Partnership formula, it would like to establish (if not 
maintain) the best possible relations with the Kremlin at the 
same time. But, in politics, it can also prove tricky to keep 
two pots on boil. In addition, the historical precedents of 
this century certainly should not encourage the Visegrad group 
leaders into thinking that the Western countries would give them 
aid worthy of the name if their relationship with Moscow were to 
deteriorate.

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION in Brussels] </F>
  [Text] The GATT deal on world trade, which took seven years 
of tough negotiating to secure, faces one more hurdle, it 
emerged today. Socialists in the European Parliament are now 
demanding the right of formal approval before the deal, with the 
promise of a multi-billion pound boost for the global economy, 
can be signed. 
  The 198-strong group of socialist Euro MPs, the biggest 
political bloc in the Strasbourg parliament, decided at talks 
today to use the GATT accord to flex their muscles as part of a 
long-running bid to exercise power. 
  The move holds no serious threat of upsetting the agreement 
but it could be delayed while Euro MPs challenge the formalities 
in the European Court of Justice, if necessary.

Haider's Spokesman Announces Legal Action'"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Joerg Haider, Freedom Party of Austria 
[FPOe] chairman, does not even want to comment on statements 
former neo-Nazi Ingo Hasselbach made in an interview with DER 
STANDARD. Hasselbach had said that Haider has had personal 
contact with the Austrian neo-Nazi scene. FPOe Press Spokesman 
Peter Westenthaler: "This is absolute nonsense." FPOe Secretary 
General Karl-Heinz Grasser said there never has been any contact 
between Haider and the two neo-Nazis Gottfried Kuessel and 
Walter Ochensberger. Grasser also said that the FPOe would take 
legal action against DER STANDARD and Hasselbach. 
  However, the FPOe did not object to Hasselbach's book 
entitled Die Abrechnung [Settling of Accounts], where 
Kuessel speaks of links between neo-Nazis and the FPOe. FPOe 
Secretary General Grasser called Hasselbach's statements a 
"complete web of lies." 
  Reinhart Rohr, Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] 
chairman for Carinthia, sees these reports in a different light. 
"If Hasselbach's allegations are true," it becomes clear why 
Haider should consider the investigations into the letter-bomb 
attacks [carried out in Austria last December] "hostile to the 
state." 
  FPOe Deputy Helmut Prasch criticized the fact that the SPOe 
seems to attach greater importance to the statement of a 
neo-Nazi than to "statements by a democratically elected 
Austrian politician."

  [Text] London, Jan. 11, IRNA -- Iran's foreign minister, 
'Ali Akbar Velayati, was due to arrive in Dublin Tuesday [11 
January] night to attend the second joint economic commission 
with Ireland. 
  During his two-day stay in the Irish capital, the Iranian 
minister is scheduled to hold talks with Ireland's President 
Mary Robinson, Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, Foreign Minister 
Dick Spring, and various other senior officials in a hectic 
timetable. 
  The joint commission was first established in April 1992, 
during a visit by the then Irish foreign minister, David 
Andrews, when a memorandum of understanding for political and 
economic cooperation was signed by the two countries. 
  In April last year, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for 
Euro-American Affairs Mahmud Va'ezi paved the way for the 
holding of the second commission, which was original scheduled 
for November but delayed until this month. 
  Velayati's visit is expected to culminate in the inking of a 
further cooperation agreement, in such areas as electronics, 
computer technology, scientific and cultural exchanges, in which 
Ireland has already expressed its interest.

  [Text] Dublin, Jan. 12, IRNA -- The Irish President Mary 
Robinson in a meeting with the visiting Iranian Foreign Minister 
'Ali Akbar Velayati here today expressed hope for the expansion 
of relations between the two countries. 
  Referring to Iran and Ireland as two spiritual countries, 
Robinson said that Iran could count on Ireland as a good friend. 
  On strengthening bilateral ties she said that mutual 
cooperation should in the long term pave the way for 
strengthening the commonalties between the Muslims and the 
Christians. 
  Expressing concern about the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
she said Ireland did not approve of what was going on there. 
  Velayati in his meeting with the Irish president defined his 
talks with the Irish officials as well as the setting up of the 
joint commission as "constructive." 
  Referring to the genocide of Muslims in Bosnia and the 
indifference of international organizations towards the crimes 
committed by the Serbs there, Velayati criticized the double 
standard attitude of the UN Security Council towards the 
Muslims.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Yesterday, Velayati met the 
head of the Irish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee and 
discussed strengthening the friendly relations between the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and Ireland as well as exchanging 
parliamentary delegations. The committee head expressed an 
interest in expanding bilateral relations and sought Velayati's 
views on international issues. 
  Last night, our foreign minister held meetings with other 
Irish officials. Our colleague Nowbaveh in London reports: 
  [Begin Nowbaveh recorded telephone report] Foreign Minister 
Velayati's meeting last night with Dick Spring, Irish foreign 
minister and deputy prime minister, discussed events, 
political-economic developments, and international security. 
The two sides expressed their views on international 
developments, namely GATT and the NATO summit in Brussels, and 
their impact on regional and international policy, security, and 
economy. The two foreign ministers also discussed developments 
in the Caucasus, Afghanistan, and the Balkans. 
  Continuing his talks with Irish officials, Velayati also met 
the agriculture and food, investment and development [title of 
ministry as heard], and defense and marine affairs ministers 
separately last night. 
  At the meeting between Velayati and the agriculture and food 
minister agreements were reached on bilateral cooperation and 
the transfer of technology on animal husbandry, genetic 
engineering, and natural resources. Since the Islamic Republic 
of Iran is one of the founders of the Economic Cooperation 
Organization, the ECO, the initial steps of Ireland's 
multilateral cooperation with ECO members was also discussed. 
  Velayati's meetings with the other ministers discussed ways 
to expand economic-commercial cooperation and cooperation in 
marine industries as well as joint investment. 
  The second joint Iranian-Irish Committee will begin its work 
in Dublin today at noon Tehran time. [end recording]

  [Text] Following Mr Velayati's meetings with the officials 
of the Republic of Ireland in Dublin and the convening of the 
two countries' joint commission, a memorandum of understanding 
on the expansion of bilateral economic and commercial relations 
was signed. 
  Today before leaving Ireland, in an interview with our 
correspondent, Mr. Velayati described his meetings with Irish 
officials as very positive, and he provided some explanations 
about the memorandum of understanding signed between the two 
countries. I draw your attention to this interview: 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Mr. Velayati, following 
the 
convening of the second joint commission which was held today in 
Dublin, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the two 
countries. Could you please give us some details about the 
contents of that memorandum of understanding and the areas of 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  [Velayati] There exists a comprehensive framework for 
bilateral cooperation in scientific, technical and educational 
fields, in the transfer of technology in the industrial, 
pharmaceutical, agricultural and animal husbandry fields, and in 
commercial exchanges. Good decisions have been taken. The 
exchange of expert teams for a complete and precise 
identification of areas of cooperation in the needed sectors, as 
well as cooperation in the field of joint investment and 
attempts to establish a kind of balance in commercial exchanges, 
and provide sufficient facilities for presenting Iran's export 
items in Ireland's markets are included in this cooperation. 
  There are definitely good grounds for the expansion of 
relations, and we can witness also clearly the political will of 
both sides for the expansion of relations -- we can see its 
signs in our meetings. While relations between the two countries 
followed a growing trend during the period between the convening 
of the former joint commission and the present joint commission, 
the memorandum of understanding which has been drawn up and 
signed today provides a new framework for the expansion of 
relations which had started and continued in a satisfactory 
manner after the convening of the first joint commission. [end

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister tonight backed away from 
unleashing air strikes against Serb positions to relieve the 
United Nations humanitarian operation in Bosnia. 
  He urged caution and was supported by Defence Secretary 
Malcolm Rifkind, who warned Britain was "not enthusiastic" about 
a policy of extending the threat of air strikes. 
  Mr. Major's tone in the Commons appeared more cautious than 
when NATO leaders agreed to the Anglo-French proposal to 
threaten airpower to break the Serbs' refusal to allow a Dutch 
force to replace 300 Canadian troops in Srebrenica and reopen 
Tuzla airport. 
  He said local cooperation from the three warring factions 
was 
vital if the aid operation was to succeed. 
  This was a primary factor to be taken into account before 
deciding if any military action needs to be taken. 
  "It is very easy to say that it is an easy decision and that 
all you have to do is unleash an aircraft or two and all is 
well," he said. 
  "I have to say to those who readily advocate that course 
without careful thought that it may well not be a wise policy. 
It may be a necessary policy at some stage -- but it is a 
policy that should be entered into with very considerable 
caution." 
  Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath issued a firm warning 
against air strikes, arguing they could suck Britain into the 
civil war and bring retaliation. "My own decision would be not 
to bomb," he said. 
  However, the French were much more bullish, with Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe warning NATO "meant business" when it 
pledged to open Tuzla airport and relieve the beleaguered 
Canadian peacekeepers in the Srebrenica Muslim enclave. 
  French Defence Minister Francois Leotard agreed on a plan to 
reopen Tuzla with his Swedish counterpart Anders Bjorck as most 
of the troops in the city are from Sweden. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali ordered a 
preliminary study of NATO's overt threat of air strikes if the 
Serbs continue to thwart the UN efforts in Srebrenica and Tuzla. 
  He asked Yasushi Akashi, his special representative in the 
former Yugoslavia, to lead the study and report to a high-level 
meeting of UN officials in the Swiss city of Geneva on Monday. 
  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] said senior military 
officials 
including the overall commander, French General Jean Cot, were 
analysing NATO's declaration and drawing up proposals to relieve 
Srebrenica and Tuzla with the help of air power. 
  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was meeting the new commander 
of the 12,000 UN peacekeeping troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  A spokesman at the Foreign Office described Mr. Hurd's 
meeting with Lieutenant-General Sir Mike Rose as "introductory." 
  British defence officials said Britain's aircrews in the 
region were ready to go if the call to action comes. 
  "We have been out there for a long time," said one official. 
"We are trained, highly capable and ready to respond to any 
decision to go." 
  A powerful allied force of strike and fighter aircraft has 
been gathered at air bases in Italy and on carriers in the 
Adriatic. 
  Britain has six Sea Harrier jump-jets aboard Invincible, 
nine 
RAF Jaguar attack jets at Gioia del Colle in Italy with three 
more available in the UK.

  [Text] They? The Americans. Europeans (and all others) 
should start being persuaded and light up their lantern. 
However, the evidence has still not hit people's minds. 
  And yet, the fall debates on the GATT were indeed revealing 
of the new behavior of the United States. This fortress, 
surprised that its "I want" was not greeted with the customary 
obedience, brandished the threat to turn away from Europe and 
isolate itself from it. The Uruguay Round ended without leaving 
any breathing space to a future world trade organization. 
Commercial universality has become the myth and regional blocs 
the reality of the next few years. Monetary heresies, cruel for 
some and delicious for others, evidently have not been put into 
question. 
  This apparent immobilism contrasts with the strategic 
evolution taking place, but silently so given that comments are 
rare and hence deserving of note. "The year 1993 will remain 
perhaps as important as 1989. Discreetly, without warning, the 
Americans have started to disengage themselves from Europe." 
This is the opinion, for instance, of Defensa-Eurostrategie's 
Philippe Grasset. The fact that under Clinton the reduction of 
the U.S. military budget has accelerated has not escaped 
attention. In eight years, with the help of inflation, its 
purchasing power suffered a three-fourths loss (from $126 
billion to $46 billion); how is it possible to limit the demands 
of the military-industrial complex, stop waste ($20 billion), 
revise an imperial strategy to confine oneself as much as 
possible, note the impossibility of simultaneously conducting 
two large-scale military operations, give up arms sales, notably 
in the Middle East, and no longer hope to have others 
finance--as was the case in the Gulf war--operations that are 
mainly in Washington's interest? These are questions--perhaps 
anguished ones--that caused the fall and departure of U.S. 
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin. Yugoslavia, Somalia, Haiti: all 
are contemporary failures revealing a deep and durable malaise. 
The mid-January meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin at a time 
when Russia and its annexes are boiling like a witches' caldron 
will add more confusion than clarity. All the more so since the 
Americans, in risking money in this mess, have been particularly 
tight (20 percent of Western assistance, compared to 80 percent 
for Europe). 
  On the other hand, one must pay attention to the NATO 
January 
summit. Since the meeting in August 1993, the United States has 
lost, in this sacred precinct of its world influence, the 
primacy for which it actually did not fight much. Somehow, this 
is a historic session: Americans are completely isolated on a 
proposal to carry out air strikes in Bosnia under the sole 
control of NATO and without a Security Council decision. Since 
then, the Clinton administration, increasingly rebellious 
against foreign affairs that only interest 2 percent of the 
American people, seems to be encouraging Europe to assume 
responsibilities and obligations to facilitate its own 
disengagement. Slyly opposed yesterday, the Eurocorps has now 
become an interesting prospect, perhaps even a model, that 
should be developed. Let us not forget to mention Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher's hostile statements on Europe, or the 
gesticulations of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
summit in Seattle. All these signs seemingly open a less 
difficult road for the Western European Union (WEU), which was 
vegetating since 1948 and is now progressively becoming a 
strucuture of reflexion, liaison, and mobilization for European 
national forces. 
  An entire apparatus, long immobile because of the Cold War 
and afterwards the U.S.-Soviet condominium, has begun to move. 
However, many seem not to have comprehended this: witness those 
French parliamentarians pleading for a return of our country to 
NAT0 under the old conditions, an astonishingly blind proposal. 
What one should notice, above all, is the mutation and the 
departure of the abusive dry nurse, both so reassuring and so 
bothersome. The foreign and common security policy explicitly 
contained in the Maastricht Treaty ought to be the answer to 
this henceforth new situation for the nations of the European 
Union. Everything now leads them to act as adults, together if 
possible, with everyone assuming full responsibility. Europe's 
defense, its strategy, its resources, its sovereignty and that 
of its member states will become full-fledged obligations. 1994 
will be a demanding, even trying year. To face it standing up 
after laying low for so long, is not that an enviable fate for 
the peoples of Europe and the best example they can set?

  [Text] Paris, Jan 12 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur held talks on bilateral cooperation Wednesday 
[12 January] with Prince Mohammad Bin-Fahd, son of Saudi 
Arabia's King Fahd, French officials said. 
  The 40-minute meeting with the man touted as the Saudi 
regime's "businessman" covered political, economic, energy, and 
defence issues, the officials said. 
  It took place three days after Balladur returned from a trip 
to Saudi Arabia, during which the two countries agreed to create 
a bilateral commission of experts on financing maintenance of 
French military equipment sold to the Arab state. 
  But the French premier failed to seal hoped-for business 
deals during his stay. 
  A spokesman for Balladur said the meeting had "given a major 
boost" to bilateral relations. 
  The prince, who is the governor of Saudi Arabia's Eastern 
Province, had talks with France's defence and interior ministers 
Tuesday. 
  He was also due to meet President Francois Mitterand later 
Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of </F>
France, by Francoise Crouigneau and Jean de Belot; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] With the installation of the Monetary Policy 
Council last Friday [7 January], Jean-Claude Trichet now has all 
the mechanisms of an independent Bank of France whose 
credibility he must now establish. To achieve that, the governor 
explains in an interview granted to LES ECHOS that he intends to 
pursue a policy of a "stable franc" -- an expression he prefers 
to that of "strong franc" -- while accepting the democratic 
counterpart of independence, namely relations which are as "rich 
and fruitful" as possible with Parliament. 
  But although the former Treasury director is pleased to see 
German, British, and French interest rates now return to a 
"narrow range," the loss of control of European public deficits 
worries him. As a possible disrupting factor within the European 
Union, they will be closely monitored by the governor of the 
Bank of France. And especially by the European Monetary 
Institute [EMI]. As for the single currency, Jean-Claude 
Trichet calmly believes in it. Thanks to the fact that the 
Maastricht Treaty is being implemented to the letter, it will be 
formed, he thinks, by those in a position to do so. Within the 
required time and by 1999 at the latest. 
  [LES ECHOS] With the first meeting of the monetary policy 
committee, you have just inaugurated the new mechanisms of a 
Bank of France which is independent at last. Is this council 
not rather too homogeneous to be fully credible? 
  [Trichet] The procedure for appointing the council's members 
provides exceptional guarantees of credibility. Just think that 
each of the council's members has, if I can say so, four 
signatures below his name: That of the speaker who nominated 
him, and those of the president of the republic, the prime 
minister, and the economy minister, because the appointment is 
made by cabinet decree. I think that our college has great 
collective authority based on a unique combination of strong 
personalities who have rich and diverse national and 
international training and experience and have exercised 
top-level responsibilities. 
  [LES ECHOS] However, do you not think that the council's 
members largely support the policy known as the strong franc 
policy? 
  [Trichet] As you know, the term which I prefer is that of 
the currency's internal and external credibility and stability. 
This clearly says what it means. Moreover, I do not think you 
would be able to find one central bank chief in the world who 
supported a weak currency.... 
  What I am sure about, is that the Monetary Policy Council 
will define our monetary policy in all conscience without 
neglecting any analysis, or any approach, and taking advantage 
of the wealth and diversity of its composition. 
  [LES ECHOS] So, you expect the Monetary Policy Council to 
show some contradiction in this sphere? 
  [Trichet] There will certainly be no contradiction because 
the college will decide and its decision will, of course, be 
clear and single. But there will certainly be depth and 
richness in the debates within it. The people who are members 
provide a full guarantee. Just think. There is a chairman of 
an insurance multinational, who is an economist and financier of 
international reputation, a journalist whose pedagogical talent 
is unparalleled in France and who is, moreover, the head of an 
enterprise, a university teacher who knows all there is to know 
about France's monetary history and whose many books are 
regarded as authoritative, an employer with unique experience of 
large and small high-technology industries, an IMF 
administrator, the chairman of a bank and head of the Stock 
Exchange, and an economy minister who everybody remembers. I do 
no need to introduce the deputy governors of the Bank of France 
who, like me, are members of the Monetary Policy Council. 
Believe me, the nine wisemen will do good work. 
  [LES ECHOS] However, do you not have a majority of 
pro-Maastricht people on this council? 
  [Trichet] I do not intend to become involved in that debate. 
The Monetary Policy Council defines monetary policy according to 
the law. The college is a single entity and I will not indulge 
in the little game of "prognostication." 
  [LES ECHOS] How will you organize the communication of 
decisions by the Monetary Policy Council? 
  [Trichet] There are obviously important times when there are 
things to say. I gave a public speech last Friday when the 
Monetary Policy Council was installed by the prime minister and 
the bank therefore made a statement on that occasion. The bank 
will also make statements when the aims of monetary policy are 
established. This is a conventional communique which obviously 
changes in nature because previously there was a meeting of the 
National Credit Council, a speach by the economy and finance 
minister, and a press conference given by the governor, all of 
which were coordinated. 
  There will now be a statement on the year's monetary policy 
after consideration and a decision made fully and exclusively by 
the Monetary Policy Council. The first two main dates are, 
first the launch and installation of the new Bank of France and, 
second, the monetary policy objectives for 1994. A third major 
date in terms of statements will be the governor's annual report 
submitted at least once a year, the law stipulates, to the 
president of the republic and Parliament. 
  [LES ECHOS] Would you be in favor of reporting to Parliament 
more than once a year? 
  [Trichet] One of the innovations introduced by the new 
statute is, in fact, the establishment of a strong link between 
the new institution and Parliament. My objective is to have a 
well integrated Bank of France which plays an active part in our 
democratic system. Our institution could not be isolated in an 
ivory tower. 
  It must establish a permanent dialogue with the nation's 
deputies and, through them, with public opinion as with the 
country's vital forces -- I will return to this. This link with 
Parliament is organized by several provisions of the law: The 
governor reports to Parliament at least once a year; he passes 
on the accounts of the Bank of France to the National Assembly 
and Senate Finance Commissions. The law also stipulates that 
the latter can ask the governor to attend a hearing and that the 
governor can ask for a hearing with the Finance Commissions. 
  My feeling on this subject is very clear: I am convinced 
that the relationship between the institution of the Bank of 
France and Parliament is crucial, that it is -- in a democracy 
-- a necessary counterpart of independence and that it is 
extremely important that we in this house should really be 
prepared for this relationship to be as rich and fruitful as 
possible. I have had the opportunity to express my complete 
readiness for this once again to the chairmen of the two 
assemblies' Finance Commissions. 
  [LES ECHOS] Aside from these major dates, what method of 
information will you adopt: That of the Bundesbank's irregular 
press conferences or the publication of the minutes of the 
Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee? 
  [Trichet] Following meetings of the Monetary Policy Council, 
it is possible to imagine there being a communique in some cases 
or, if necessary, a press conference. Another thing strikes me 
as important: What I would call listening and informal 
exchanges. The Bank of France must have its ear to the whole 
economy, to the country, and public opinion. It has experience 
of this: It has its network, its investigations, its 
consultative council, and its branch councils with industrial 
and commercial officials throughout the country. 
  An independent central bank absolutely must -- this is true 
of the United States and Germany to mention just these two 
examples -- be very close to the real economy and the two sides 
of industry. This is because the independent central bank has 
the task of safeguarding the currency -- which is common 
property -- for the benefit of all and must do so on the basis 
of four principles: listening, deciding, explaining, and 
convincing. 
  [LES ECHOS] How will you react to your new relations with 
the state, with the Treasury, which you headed a short time ago, 
and especially with the budget ministry? 
  [Trichet] The relationship with the state is laid down by 
the law. The prime minister and the economy minister have 
access to the Monetary Policy Council. This is an important 
initial bridge and does not undermine the monetary authority. 
Such a provision operates in Germany without there being any 
doubt about who is responsible for what. 
  [LES ECHOS] But you are cutting the umbilical cord with 
the Treasury which was an essential element in the Economy 
Ministry's network? 
  [Trichet] The Treasury is the economy minister. The 
umbilical cord has indeed been cut. It is the government which 
wanted it with regard to monetary policy. But there are two 
other aspects to consider. First, the exchange system. The law 
says that it is for the government to determine it. The Bretton 
Woods agreements, the formation of the European Monetary System 
[EMS], the changes to parity in the EMS are, in the final 
analysis, the responsibility of governments everywhere. 
  The second important factor is the Bank of France which is 
the monetary authority, the institution of the republic which, 
through the legislator's will, has the responsibility of 
conducting monetary policy everywhere by being the guardian of 
the currency on behalf of all French people. Third, you have 
the Bank of France as an enterprise from which the shareholder 
-- the state -- is justified in asking the same management 
efficiency as is required from the whole public sector. This 
sphere does not enter into the sphere of monetary policy. 
  [LES ECHOS] The first discussions within the independent 
Bank of France will probably relate to the time frames with 
regard to interest rate reductions? 
  [Trichet] As governor of the Central Bank, I am very 
privileged: I never say what will be done in the sphere of 
interest rates. 
  [LES ECHOS] However, do you think you have room to maneuver? 
  [Trichet] I will not say anything about the future which we 
will discuss in the Monetary Policy Council. I will just make 
one observation. When I look at the past, I note that the 
franc's credibility and stability have been accompanied by a 
very large reduction in our market interest rates. It is the 
franc's resilience which has made this reduction in our interest 
rates possible, especially the medium- and long-term rates. 
  [LES ECHOS] Does France's European choice not effectively 
reduce your room to maneuver and hence the scope of the reform 
of the Bank of France? 
  [Trichet] When you administer monetary policy, you are not 
just administering the rate day by day. In reality, we are 
administering a "yield curve." With proper monetary intruments 
over the shortest part. With credibility and stability, which 
are factors which directly and deeply influence the longer term. 
This is what is being administered with a number of complex, 
technical tools, but also with the emission of signals which 
contribute to the clarity of the monetary message. And it is 
true to say that this "yield curve" of French interest rates is 
not independent of the European environment, characterized by 
persistent inflation in some countries and by large public 
deficits. 
  The art of the central bank chief consists of relying on the 
credibility and stability of his currency and, taking account of 
the constraints of the European environment, seeking the best 
possible yield curve. 
  [LES ECHOS] Are the public deficits in France not taking on 
worrying proportions? 
  [Trichet] I welcome the French Government's decision to 
launch a medium-term convergence program to resume control of 
these public deficits. I think that this is very important. It 
was also very appropriate to do it at the same time as the 
Germans, because it is a general European problem. I am 
convinced that we would not have the low medium- and long-term 
market interest rates which we now have if this medium-term 
convergence plan had not existed. There is a close link between 
the credibility of the restoration of balance in our public 
accounts and being able to secure better financing conditions 
for the economy. 
  [LES ECHOS] The financial markets are still finding this 
rather difficult to believe. Do you think that the risk premium 
from which the franc suffered has really disappeared? 
  [Trichet] The markets are giving us interest rates of the 
order of 5 percent over five years and 5.7 percent over 10 
years, in other words, rates comparable to those of Germany. 
Within the Group of Seven, France has the lowest five-year 
interest rates, aside from Japan. Over recent months, the 
approach has been this: We have the good fortune to have a good 
level of long-term credibility; let us safeguard this 
credibility by pursuing a policy of stability with regard to the 
franc to secure 10-year rates which are among the lowest in 
Europe. On that basis, we have been able to record a decrease 
over the short part of the curve. 
  [LES ECHOS] Do you think it is possible to speed up the 
process of moving toward Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]? 
  [Trichet] The Maastricht Treaty has been ratified by the 
European Twelve. We are in phase two and, naturally, together 
with all our European partners, and especially the Bank of 
France with the other 11 central banks of the European Union, we 
will implement phase two and working within the EMI. I have 
great confidence in Mr. Lamfalussy who has been appointed by the 
European Council to be its president and I am sure that we will 
do good work. 
  [LES ECHOS] Is it possible to count on France and Germany 
as a driving force in this sphere? 
  [Trichet] I hope so, and I am convinced that the Bundesbank 
and the Bank of France, with all the other central banks, will 
take care to ensure that real work can be done. Just think that 
in a period which is, after all, short, we must harmonize 
monetary instruments at the European level, harmonize 
statistical and technical concepts making fusion possible 
because that is the aim laid down by the Maastricht Treaty. It 
is an enormous task which does not necessarily give rise to 
high-flown communiques or spectacular initiatives. In my view, 
the implementation of the EMI opens up very major practical 
spheres for work. 
  [LES ECHOS] Does the EMI also have to monitor economic 
management? 
  [Trichet] In addition to monetary cooperation, there is 
indeed the whole aspect of the judgment passed on all the 
elements of economic policy in Europe. This brings us back to 
what I was telling you about our position within regard to 
public finances at the level of Europe as a whole, which is a 
serious and crucial subject. 
  [LES ECHOS] Are your prerogatives as governor not likely to 
be limited by the replacement of the former Committee of 
Governors by the EMI? 
  [Trichet] The EMI does not upset things from that viewpoint. 
The Committee of Governors had an important function which it 
fulfilled informally and formally in semi-official or "ex 
cathedra" meetings. The governors also participate in all the 
informal Economic and Finance Council meetings. There are 
therefore many bridges, many meetings. I think that the EMI 
will merely consolidate them. 
  [LES ECHOS] Now that we are gently returning to the 
fluctuation bands which preceded the EMS crisis in the summer, 
are you in favor of a redefinition of the EMS? 
  [Trichet] In this sphere, too, the fundamental rule must be 
pragmatism. Experience has shown that the finance ministers and 
the governors found the right response to July's crisis on 1 and 
2 August: To confirm the validity of the scale of central 
rates, fully justified by the fundamental economic facts while 
temporarily expanding the fluctuation bands to discourage 
speculation. This strategy has proved effective. 
  [LES ECHOS] Were you almost surprised by it in restrospect? 
  [Trichet] It is a good system. It was adapted to the 
circumstances in which the Europeans found themselves. These 
subjects must not be approached in a theoretical and abstract 
way, it is better to approach them in a practical and concrete 
way. That is what we did. And it worked well. 
  [LES ECHOS] Are you in favor of speeding up a rapprochement 
among the European Union's most stable currencies? 
  [Trichet] Things are in fact very simple. We have the 
Maastricht Treaty ratified by the Twelve. It has been in force 
since 1 November. All the states in the European Union are 
rule-of-law states. We will implement the Maastricht Treaty. 
Reread it. It gives all the appropriate answers with regard to 
the criteria and procedures leading to phase three which makes 
it possible for a single currency to come into force.

<F P=106> [Statement by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the </F>
Bundestag in Bonn on 13 January -- live] 
  [Text] Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the summit 
meeting of the 16 NATO member states on 10 and 11 January in 
Brussels was quite certainly a milestone on the path toward a 
new security system for Europe after the end of the East-West 
conflict. The summit yielded four essential results: 
  First, NATO emphasized the close ties between North America, 
in particular the United States, and Europe. 
  Second, cooperation between the Atlantic alliance and 
European Union will be considerably intensified. 
  Third, NATO is offering a Partnership for Peace to the 
countries of Central, East, and southeast Europe, as well as to 
the successor states to the Soviet Union. 
  Fourth, the alliance has given a clear signal that NATO is 
open for new members. 
  The alliance has thus proved the central importance of NATO 
as the cornerstone of security and stability, not only for the 
members of the alliance, but, beyond that, for all of Europe. 
[applause] 
  We as Germans, in particular, have experienced that the 
strength and the solidarity of the alliance made a decisive 
contribution to the end of the Cold War and the division of 
Europe and Germany. This historic success of NATO is mainly 
based on the firm security alliance between North America and 
Europe. 
  In his great speech in Brussels City Hall on 9 January, 
President Clinton affirmed that the partnership in the security 
alliance with Europe remains a priority for the United States. 
He also promised that some 100,000 U.S. troops would remain 
stationed in Europe. In addition, he expressly praised and 
recognized Germany's role for the establishment of a stable 
peace system in Europe. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, NATO unambiguously supports the 
Maastricht Treaty and, thus, the further political unification 
of Europe. This applies also to the efforts, which we all want, 
especially we Germans, to develop an independent European 
security policy and defense system with the help of the Western 
European Union as the security policy branch of the political 
union according to the Maastricht Treaty. Reservations in this 
connection, which have sometimes been voiced in the past by some 
representatives of the U.S. Administration, no longer exist. 
[applause] 
  In the future, the Western European Union will be able to 
rely on NATO forces for its own missions, if necessary. 
  The second significant result of our talks is NATO's 
invitation to the young democracies in Central, East, and 
southeast Europe and the successor states to the Soviet Union to 
cooperate even more closely with us -- politically and 
militarily -- within the framework of the Partnership for Peace. 
  At the same time, the Brussels summit also sent out the 
signal that NATO is open to new members. We want to lead the 
former communist nations in Central and East Europe gradually 
closer to NATO, eventually even offering them membership, if 
these countries so wish, of course. [applause] 
  This new approach is a historically unprecedented offer to 
create a military alliance for comprehensive cooperation and 
partnership with former opponents. 
  All states accepting this partnership will have the 
opportunity to participate in joint military planning and 
exercises. This includes joint training and participation in 
international peacekeeping missions. With these measures, NATO 
wants to contribute to establishing armed forces that are 
committed to democracy and whose inner structures are comparable 
with those of our armed forces. 
  Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, one of the central 
elements of this program is the offer to enter into 
consultations with partners if they fear a direct threat to 
their territorial integrity, political independence, or 
security. Our Partnership for Peace program is such that this 
process can take place in a flexible, individual way, taking 
into account other developments in Europe. Each country is 
invited to contribute its share to this partnership. Our future 
partners will be given the opportunity to codetermine the speed 
and extent of approaching NATO according to their own interests. 
[applause]. 
  In view of the wishes of some of our East European partners 
to become members, NATO is faced with difficult questions. We 
understand the need for security and the fears of the people in 
these countries. These fears are based on tragic experiences in 
this century. In addition, the people in Central and East 
Europe were longing for freedom and democracy during the years 
of the Cold War. After the Iron Curtain came down, we 
encouraged these countries to introduce democracy and a market 
economy of the Western type. Therefore, their wish to join the 
great institutions of the West is very understandable. 
[applause]. At the same time, there are historically based 
fears, especially in Russia, of isolation. We, and especially we 
Germans, must take this concern seriously. [applause]. That is 
why NATO is looking for comprehensive cooperation with Russia 
and Ukraine in security policy and the military fields. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, if we want to achieve this goal of 
establishing a solid European security system, we all must take 
account of these psychological features and security interests. 
After our own experiences in this century, there must by no 
means be new divisions in Europe. Security and stability in 
Europe are indivisible. [applause]. 
  That is why I think that disappointment or discouragement 
about the decisions made at the NATO summit are not at all 
appropriate. Our offer, which some countries have already 
accepted, is an important step that is intended seriously for 
the future NATO membership of the Central and East European 
states. Today Germany has good relations with all countries in 
Central and East Europe, including Russia. This gives us the 
special opportunity to work toward this process constructively 
on a bilateral basis. And our proximity to these countries, as 
well as our special historic experience and responsibility 
oblige us to do this. For me, an essential outcome of the 
negotiations in Brussels is that the Atlantic alliance and the 
European Union [EU] are working toward the same goal, namely to 
include the young democracies in Central and East Europe in 
existing Western communities. At the Conference of the European 
Council in Copenhagen in June 1993, the EU offered concrete 
perspectives for membership to our neighbors in the east. We 
Germans especially want these countries to join. Yet, and this 
has to be made clear as well, they themselves have to create and 
meet the political and economic preconditions for membership. 
[applause]. 
  We do not want to forget that these prospects for 
membership are of immediate significance in terms of security 
policy. After all, under the Maastricht Treaty one of the 
European Union's key objectives is to develop joint security and 
foreign policy. These countries will, thus, get the opportunity 
to participate in this development even before they become 
members. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen; this policy primarily also corresponds 
to our own vital interests in Germany. It is absolutely 
inconceivable to me that the German-Polish border should remain 
the eastern border of European political union forever. 
[applause] 
  In the other reform countries of East Europe, the European 
Union wants to develop relations in partnership on the basis of 
appropriate treaties. The Federal Government is pressing to 
conclude particularly the agreement with Russia as soon as 
possible. 
  Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen; for many people the 
situation in the reform states, particularly in Russia itself, 
is characterized by enormous social problems, economic misery, 
and insecurity. The increasing crime and as yet insufficient 
structures of a rule-of-law state constitute a heavy burden on 
the people's day-to-day lives. They make economic reform 
difficult, which, understandably, leads to tension in domestic 
policy and even contributes to instability. 
  The election in Russia and the big success of extremist 
forces are, therefore, a serious warning signal not only for the 
Russian leadership but for all of us. We in the West, too, must 
look even more closely than in the past at the immediate effects 
of the economic reform on the Russian population. 
  At the Brussels summit we agreed that we must continue to 
support the policy of political reform in Russia, which has been 
personified by President Yeltsin since he took power. Despite 
all justified concerns about the Russian election result, we 
must not abandon our course. Progress must make itself clearly 
felt, especially for the people, whose standard of living has 
dramatically decreased in the recent past. [applause] 
  We must not, however, ignore the shrill extremist sounds 
that 
we can now sometimes hear from Moscow. This is the one side. 
On the other hand, we should not contribute to dramatizing 
things. The extent of the social, political, and economic 
reorganization is absolutely unprecedented in history. A 
totalitarian communist dictatorship ruled in Russia after 1917, 
and, over the decades, generated a system that was hostile to 
the people and economically inefficient. Lifting the burden 
produced by such a regime takes time, courage, and incredible 
energy. Given the enormity of the challenge, the process can 
progress only slowly. The awareness of the people affected can 
adapt to the changes only gradually, and setbacks are inevitable 
in this process. Therefore, whenever we look at the 
developments in Moscow and Russia, we should not apply our 
traditional Western standards but show understanding for the 
special situation there. [applause] 
  But we should not forget that, despite all the 
difficulties, the reform process in Russia has also brought 
about enormous progress. A majority of voters have given Russia 
a democratic constitution for the first time. The forming of 
democratic parties has begun; admittedly this has been quite 
difficult. In certain fields of economic reform, for instance 
with privatizations, we have seen the first successes. For me, 
this means that we must not let up in our efforts to support the 
reform process. What is of decisive importance is that we open 
our markets for goods from the reform countries. Economic aid, 
advice, and credits alone cannot bring about the desired 
results, however, if the countries are not enabled to earn their 
foreign currency themselves through exports. [applause] Of 
course, we will have to expect the Russian Government to 
continue conducting a policy of partnership, responsibility, and 
constructive participation in solving international problems. 
Hegemonic ambitions, of whatever kind, would be incompatible 
with these expectations. 
  Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the alliance also 
agreed that Ukraine is an important partner for a future 
European security system. Nuclear disarmament in Ukraine, as 
laid down in the new agreement between Ukraine, the United 
States, and Russia, will have to be effected as quickly as 
possible. Ukraine's security cannot be guaranteed by nuclear 
weapons, but only by close cooperation with its neighbors and 
NATO. [applause] I think we agree in expecting and desiring 
President Clinton's efforts in Kiev and Moscow to be successful. 
  Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, to safeguard peace 
and 
stability in Europe, existing borders must remain untouched and 
minorities' rights be protected. The summit, therefore, 
welcomed the EU's initiative to establish a stability pact in 
Europe as an important contribution to peace and security. Over 
the past months and years we saw old centers of tension in 
Europe flare up and develop into bitter and bloody conflicts. 
At the Brussels summit we also discussed the situation in 
former Yugoslavia in detail. Safeguarding humanitarian supplies 
to the people there must remain our first priority. The 
alliance confirmed its readiness -- let me quote from the 
declaration -- under the authority of the UN Security Council 
and in accordance with the alliance decisions of 2 and 9 August 
1993, to carry out air strikes to prevent the strangulation of 
Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
  We will continue to try and achieve a political solution to 
the conflict and will thus support the efforts on part of the 
United Nations and the European Union. Unfortunately, the talks 
between Croats and Bosnians in Bonn last weekend did not lead to 
a breakthrough. Ladies and Gentlemen, people in many countries, 
including Germany, think that the efforts to end the conflict 
are insufficient. This is quite understandable. [applause] 
  In view of the terrible images we get to see in the 
conflict area many people are asking themselves why the West 
and, particularly, why NATO is not doing more to end the 
conflict. I have great understanding for this question. 
Nevertheless, I would like to point out here that people often 
forget to what extent this war is dominated by hatred and 
irrational behavior -- developments that did not build up 
overnight but over decades or even centuries; and that all 
military experts concur that a comprehensive intervention to end 
the war with ground forces would require many hundreds of 
thousands of soldiers. Such an operation would cause many 
victims, even among the civilian population, and even then the 
question would remain whether lasting peace could thus be 
created. 
  The truth is -- and one can say it with anger and 
bitterness, 
but it remains the truth -- that there is no magic formula for 
solving this conflict. We Germans, in particular, should be 
very cautious as far as giving good advice to others. We do not 
have the moral right to ask more from the responsible 
authorities in other countries -- and this is what I experience 
in my talks on a daily basis -- than what we do ourselves. 
[applause] 
  When I look at my colleagues from France or Spain, who, as a 
result of their operational orders, have to bear the 
responsibility for the lives and the safety of young soldiers, I 
know what I am talking about, and I think we all see that 
similarly. 
  Nevertheless, we want to take any opportunity, including 
today's, to thank these young soldiers from many nations and to 
express our sympathy to them and their families. After all, 
they are risking their lives in a difficult place for the cause 
of peace. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the former Yugoslavia is only one 
example, albeit the most terrifying one at the moment, that war 
has not been banned from Europe forever. Therefore, the 
development of a European peace system -- and let met put it in 
even more straightforward terms -- therefore, political 
unification is more important than ever. After all, the 
European Union, which we want, is more than a mere economic 
community, a community guided by the economic and financial 
interests of its members. The deepening and simultaneous 
extension of the European Union are decisive for the securing of 
peace and freedom. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the fact that this year we can look 
back at 48 years of peace, the longest period of peace in modern 
history, also has something to do with the fact that people in 
Europe have come closer together. In this sense, and with a 
view to the next generation and what will come in the 21st 
century, the question of European unity will always also be a 
question of war and peace in Europe in this coming century. 
[applause] 
  There is no alternative to such a policy or such a political 
vision in the foreseeable future. [applause] 
  Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the sober assessment 
of the situation in Europe at the NATO summit clearly shows that 
we will have to make our contribution to defending peace and 
freedom in the future, too. 
  This means we need a Bundeswehr that is well-trained, 
well-equipped, and highly motivated. [applause]. It means that 
the capability to form alliances and be used in missions must be 
safeguarded. [applause] Peace and freedom do not come free. We 
all know that in view of the pressing problems the Bundeswehr 
cannot be exempted from cuts. But we cannot, and must not, let 
the operation of the armed forces be threatened by this. 
  Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Europe is in a time 
of 
transition today. This transition goes hand in hand with great 
challenges and insecurity. Especially in this difficult 
situation we have to see and make use of the great opportunities 
that have arisen for Europe after the end of the East-West 
conflict. It is, therefore, an outstanding result of the NATO 
summit in Brussels, that the Atlantic alliance and the Economic 
Union are now combining their forces in order to lead the reform 
states of East and Central Europe toward the existing community 
and integrate them into it. This has always been a goal of 
German foreign policy, and it will remain so. [applause] 
  It is also true, and must be said when we are speaking of 
those days in Brussels, that the confidence of our friends and 
partners in both West and East has grown, that we are trusted. 
This international trust in the reliability and predictability 
of German foreign policy is one of our most important starting 
points for the future. It is an important asset. We have the 
compass to keep the right course -- together with our friends 
and partners -- in this transitional period that is so difficult 
for Europe. The transition is difficult, but it offers many 
more opportunities than the decades of the Cold War. 
Opportunities to secure peace and freedom for our country, for 
the people living here, and particularly for a free, open, and 
democratic Europe. [applause]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Egon Bahr, director of the Hamburg </F>
Peace Research Institute, in Hamburg, by Hero Buss in the 
Cologne studio on 12 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Buss] According to news agency reports from 
Washington today, U.S. President Bill Clinton in a television 
interview commented on internal conflicts worldwide, such as the 
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia. Regarding 
Bosnia, Clinton had corroborated his country's readiness in 
principle to take part in NATO air raids in the event of a 
continuing siege of Sarajevo, for instance. According to 
reports today, however, the President expressed doubts about the 
wisdom of foreign military missions in crisis centers in the 
world. He is quoted as saying that it is one of the saddest 
facts of the world that people slaughter one another within 
their own borders. 
  These two statements appear to clearly contradict each 
other, 
and we will try to solve this contradiction in an interview with 
security expert Egon Bahr of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD]. Good day, Mr. Bahr. 
  [Bahr] Hello, Mr. Buss. 
  [Buss] How do you interpret this? 
  [Bahr] I interpret this as the establishment of a fact, 
namely, it is objectively impossible to intervene with the aim 
of creating or enforcing peace, if people really intend to kill 
one another within the borders of their state or their former 
state. This holds true for Bosnia, Nagorno-Karabakh, southern 
Sudan, and Somalia. If they absolutely intend to do so, we 
cannot prevent them, unless we intervene in a way that allows us 
to stifle such conflicts. However, under the aspect of 
fairness and equitableness, we would then have to intervene 
everywhere, not just in regions where the media or oil interests 
suggest such an approach. 
  In the case of Yugoslavia, such an intervention would 
require 
500,000-800,000 men, which we do not have. To that extent, your 
question is justified. The option -- which no one is really 
taking seriously -- that NATO will suddenly carry out air 
strikes by mandate of the United Nations is in contradiction to 
this. 
  But I am glad he has realized this, because nothing can be 
achieved with isolated air raids at Bosnia -- neither militarily 
nor in the sense of creating peace. 
  [Buss] But, Mr. Bahr, there is still the question of what 
applies in the case of Clinton -- his tough words in Brussels or 
his more recent cautious statement? Would you have to guess, or 
do you have any new information? 
  [Bahr] No, I do not have any new information. You would 
have to ask the President. I think we should hope that the 
statements he made in Brussels will not survive today or 
tomorrow. 
  [Buss] Somalia and Bosnia, in particular, have reflected the 
international community's impotence. Would or could it be a 
solution for us to just forget our international responsibility 
and to wait and see how these civil wars will develop? 
  [Bahr] If we are unable or unwilling to create peace by 
force and to stifle a conflict, there is, first, the option to 
allow it to dry out by the embargo being made watertight, so 
that not a drop of oil, gasoline, or diesel, and nothing except 
for medicines gets into the country, or, if we are not even able 
to do this, there is, second, the option to allow the conflict 
to burn out -- as terrible as this sounds. 
  [Buss] A few words on Bonn's policy, Mr. Bahr. Reviewing 
the recent past, we see that the trend in Bonn rather is in 
favor of an increasing international commitment. In view of 
Clinton's recent statements, do you think that our government 
should perhaps reconsider its position? 
  [Bahr] No, I think in this respect, Bonn's position is 
correct, meaning that if the United Nations can implement what 
it planned to do in 1945 when it was founded, namely, to create 
global collective security, Germany must be ready to decide on a 
case-by-case basis and take part.

<F P=106> [Article by Herbert Kremp: "The Determination Is There To </F>
an Extent"] 
  [Text] President Clinton is seeking a formula for ensuring 
European security, which is now more threatened than in the days 
of the old East-West conflict and its stable rituals. Regional 
wars are being zealously fought. Russia is divided between weak 
reform forces and revisionism regarding that disastrous end to 
claims of being a world power. Ukraine, whose concessions on 
the nuclear weapons issue were triumphantly announced by 
Clinton, is a victim: It is giving in to Russian pressure in the 
form of rationing energy supplies. NATO is not assuming any 
more security guarantees. Partnership for Peace can be viewed as 
an achievement on the part of the alliance or a Russian success, 
depending on one's point of view, location, and proximity or 
distance to the east. 
  The indications are that the Serbs will be victorious in 
Bosnia. The West is growing weary of the conflict. There is an 
antipathy toward all the "parties to the conflict"; those who 
know best say that they are all unreasonable. No one asks who 
is to blame for the war. Habsburg's resignation is apparent 
among the Central Europeans that Clinton met in Prague. Bosnia 
and the West is a warning sign. 
  There was no discussion of expanding NATO to the north at 
the 
meeting of the alliance. Yalta is being recalled in Finland, to 
which Zhirinovskiy has already laid claim. Let us assume that 
the country wants to become a NATO peace partner and -- U.S. 
Defense Secretary Aspin talked of "self-selection" [preceding 
word in English] -- opts for the offer of joint maneuvers. How 
would the Russians react, like Yeltsin overshadowed by the 
radicals? Would they protest (Finland has a border with Russia 
that is 1,300 kilometers long) and what would the West do? 
  The Baltic states remain under pressure, and Poland, for the 
sake of which Britain declared war in 1939 but did not 
intervene, is disappointed. Slovakia was not mentioned as an 
example among the countries to which partnership has been 
offered. 
  In Moscow, Clinton will be asked what the treaties that 
could 
be concluded with NATO would mean in operational terms. 
  Yeltsin cannot -- this is to be assumed -- tolerate what 
would even be a harmless move closer to NATO, except if Moscow 
were to join in and could drill on the territory of its former 
satellites once again. As Russia has had success with its 
objections, it will shortly seek to obtain further successes 
with the detailed definition of the new partnership arrangements. 
  The question that arises is to what extent is there 
sufficient determination and unity not only to "open up" the 
alliance eastward -- those are just word games -- but also to 
draw the East into Western security structures. If American 
policy -- as would seem to be the case -- is geared toward doing 
"everything possible" for the beleaguered Yeltsin, it must allow 
itself to be dictated "almost everything" by the patient, who 
can point to the consequences for his health every time the West 
becomes agitated. His generals and radicals might recommend a 
security vacuum in East Central and northern Europe for medical 
reasons. Can the West -- with its premises -- deal with that? 
  If Clinton has set a course, it does not apply to the 
European states between the alliance and Russia but to the 
Russians and the West Europeans. In Brussels, the president 
provided a first answer to the questions: Will the United 
States remain a leading power in Europe? Will it continue to be 
in a position -- politically and militarily -- to provide the 
resources for such a commitment? After a year as a president 
preoccupied with domestic matters, Clinton has opted for: Yes, 
the Americans will remain; they will remain with 100,000 men. 
They are, as Clinton said, "naturally also" a reserve for the 
event of crises close to Europe (forward deployment). However, 
they are in Europe. Moscow will understand that correctly: The 
Soviet Union had to abandon its forward positions, but the 
United States does not have to. There has to be a difference in 
rank. 
  That, of course, does not mean that the U.S. policy on 
Europe 
has been thoroughly thought out. Such commitments depend on the 
internal situation in a country more than ever before. It also 
depends on the personality of the president himself. Bush 
wanted to lead, and for that reason he was skeptical about the 
WEU -- a European organization whose military significance was 
zero. With Clinton, it was possible to easily reach an 
agreement: If the WEU wants to do something some day, it can 
use certain NATO command centers. Please do it, go ahead -- 
there is something ironic about this consensus. The Americans 
will remain militarily present in Germany. That is important 
for the insecure country. At the same time, the result of the 
NATO conference -- "partnership" -- is not as much a victory as 
a semi-defeat for the German side. The U.S. concept restricts 
Germany's room for maneuver in its policy toward the East. EU 
[European Union] limits are being followed by NATO limits. 
  Perhaps, the German Government does not want to function 
without such restrictions. Ruehe was quite alone in thinking 
about a Germany surrounded solely by NATO states ("friends") and 
in speaking out in favor of expanding the alliance and its 
security guarantees. As effectively the strongest alliance state 
in Europe, Germany would have greatly gained in influence. The 
significance is obvious: The eastern part of Central Europe is 
a neighboring region and the security vacuum already starts on 
the territory of the former GDR. The issue is about interests. 
Ruehe was considered wrong. Ruehe is not Kohl, and Kohl does 
not necessarily support Ruehe and his bolder concept for Central 
Europe.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Riedmiller: "They Are Not Yet Being </F>
Embraced"] 
  [Text] At the conclusion of the NATO summt conference in 
Brussels there was no lack of lofty rhetoric on the Western side 
since there was no room for major accomplishments. NATO 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner described the Partnership for 
Peace program, which was devised in Washington and is intended 
to let the reform states that emerged from the rubble of the 
former East Bloc lean on NATO but deny them direct access, as a 
"historic turning point." In less pretentious words, Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke of a "decisive step," which would 
have to be followed by intensive contacts not only with those 
countries that are seeking NATO membership but also with those 
countries, such as Russia and Ukraine, that are not among the 
group of candidates. That is balsam on the wounds of the 
disappointed; one will talk to them, but one will not embrace 
them -- not yet. 
  This is not contradictory to the fact that on his visit to 
Prague and Moscow, Bill Clinton will go further than just 
shaking people's hands and take one or the other Partner for 
Peace into his arms; after all, it is mainly the U.S. 
President's policy not to extend NATO toward the east at the 
current stage and to prevent an "over-commitment" in Europe. 
This position is not at all merely determined by the intention 
not to provoke Russia, to strengthen its reform forces, and not 
to provide their nationalist opponents with any new arguments; 
behind it is also the understanding that East and Central Europe 
has not yet settled down and that it still harbors a 
considerable dangerous potential. This potential is not only 
the result of the sometimes strong ups and downs of Moscow 
politics but it is somehow locally rooted. Nothing shows that 
more clearly than the competition between the Visegrad countries 
(Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic), as to which 
of them is more worthy of NATO membership. These four primary 
membership candidates neither follow a single course nor can it 
be said that they have already settled all the problems between 
them. 
  It is not only a "gray area of security," as Kohl put it, 
but 
also a gray area in a political respect. That is quite natural 
and it is reflected in the differing intensity of the feeling of 
insecurity, which is stronger in Poland than, for example, in 
Hungary. This is why Polish President Lech Walesa stands in the 
first rank of critics of NATO's cautious position; for him it is 
a consequence of Russian blackmailing. However, his severe 
verdict fails to take account of the fact that, apart from 
Slovakia and Lithuania, Poland is the only would-be NATO member 
with a government in which neo- or reform-communist forces play 
a significant role. This would also have to be taken into 
consideration if NATO were to begin defining membership criteria 
for East and Central European members. Nevertheless, Walesa's 
proposal to accept even Russia as a NATO member to control its 
arsenal of nuclear arms does retain its humorous fascination. 
  In the light of NATO's stance in the conflict in Bosnia it 
has turned out that the Western alliance is not at all able to 
prevent all wars or to end them in time; it is, thus, all the 
more surprising that the Visegrad states and even the Baltic 
countries assume that NATO might have this very power. The 
Clinton Administration has drawn different conclusions from the 
experience of helplessness: since the transatlantic alliance 
basically has no longer any enemies (not even Russia), security 
has to be defined differently today. For Washington, a security 
policy of a new kind must focus on the control of arms of mass 
destruction and the prevention of new conflict situations and in 
the creation of stability. It is more of a development program 
than a strategy of military containment. And there are no plans 
for security guarantees, as requested by the East and Central 
Europeans as a substitute for direct NATO membership. To cover 
the "gray zone" with security guarantees should deter all those 
who are now requesting them: Poland had such guarantees in 1939, 
but they became effective only six years later, six years too 
late.

  [Text] Bonn, Jan. 12, IRNA -- Vice-Chairman of the Iranian 
Majles Foreign Commission Mohammad Javad Larijani held talks 
with President of the German Parliament (Bundestag) Ms. Rita 
Suessmuth and other ranking officials on issues of mutual 
interest, regional and international issues here Tuesday [11 
January]. 
  Among other things, the two discussed establishment of peace 
in the Middle East, the situation in the Central Asian states 
and former Soviet republics. 
  Underlining the importance of Iran-German parliamentary 
friendship group, Ms. Suessmuth formally demanded that German 
national, Helmut Szimkus, sentenced to death for espionage, be 
pardoned by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah 'Ali 
Khamene'i. 
  Referring to Iran's policy in Central Asian republics, 
Larijani who arrived here last Monday, said Tehran was to 
provide security to its borders with those countries. 
  He noted that the U.S. prevented Iran from having 
cooperation 
with the Persian Gulf littoral states and from setting up 
regional cooperation to bring peace and stability into the 
region. 
  Larijani also said Iran was for annihilation of arms of mass 
destruction, atomic, chemical and biological weapons in the 
region. 
  On Tehran's opposition to the PLO-Israeli accord, the 
Iranian 
official said Iran only expressed its political opinion in this 
connection and it was not an obstacle to peace but was rather 
for realization of a just and real peace. 
  The only way for real and lasting peace in the region was 
consideration of equal rights for Muslims, Christians and Jews, 
he noted. 
  "The Islamic Republic of Iran is always ready to use its 
influence, if asked by Europe, in the region to establish real 
peace," Larijani said. 
  In another development, Larijani had a separate meeting with 
Deputy Economic Minister of Germany Dieter von Wuerzen who 
stressed the importance of continuation and improvement of 
Iran-Germany political and economic relations. 
  He also welcomed the proposal of cooperation among Iran, 
Europe and the Central Asian republics and expressed Bonn's 
readiness to play an active role in Iran's second five-year 
development plan (1994-98). 
  Head of the German Parliamentary friendship group, Christoth 
Matschie [name as received], also present in the meeting lauded 
Iran's efforts for establishment of peace in the region, to 
mediate between warring Azerbaijan and Armenia in particular, 
and for hosting millions of Afghan, Azeri and Iraqi refugees. 
  He referred to the Rushdie issue, allegations on Iran's 
involvement in assassination of kurdish leaders in Berlin and 
Iran's disagreement with the PLO-Israeli accord as differences 
existing between the two countries. 
  Larijani, in response mentioned the granting of asylum to 
terrorist organizations by Germany, Bonn's failure to carry out 
its obligation towards Tehran including completion of Bushehr 
power- plant, negligence of German judiciary system regarding 
hundreds of Iranian prisoners in Germany, the West's support for 
Salman Rushdie and the biased stance and unrealistic attitude of 
the German press against Iran. 
  He said Iran considered the West's support for Rushdie as 
open hostility with Islam and Islamic sanctities.

  [Text] Bonn, Jan 13, IRNA -- A senior Iranian 
parliamentarian here Wednesday [12 January] termed as fruitful 
his visit to Germany and talks with German officials. 
  Especial envoy of the Majles presiding board and head of 
Iran- Germany parliamentary friendship group Mohammad Javad 
Larijani told IRNA here that the Iranian parliamentary 
delegation visits Germany at the invitation of German parliament. 
  He said his visit aimed at clarifying Iran's stands on 
important regional issues, removing obstacles on mutual ties and 
identifying new grounds for future cooperation in the region. 
  Larijani added that the Iranian delegation and German 
authorities exchanged views on such topics as Central Asia, 
Iran-Germany cooperation in the region, Middle East issues and 
Israel-PLO deal. 
  The Iranian official further noted that the apostate Salman 
Rushdie's blasphemous book had harmed peace, security and 
understanding among followers of different religions because of 
insulting millions of Muslims. 
  He remarked that Iran's delayed debts to Germany was not 
considerable compared to the amount of Germany's exports to Iran 
during the past years and believed German Government could find 
reasonable settlements to the issue. 
  Larijani and his accompying delegation arrived here last 
Monday and will visit other German cities and hold talks with 
local officials.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Kohl: The Bundeswehr Will </F>
Retain 370,000 Men"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In view of the unstable situation in former 
Yugoslavia and the uncertainty surrounding the Russian reform 
process, Chancellor Kohl wants to maintain the Bundeswehr at its 
current level of 370,000 men. 
  In an interview with the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG, Kohl 
said 
that what remained crucial for him was "that our armed forces 
remain capable of discharging alliance responsibilities, are 
prepared for action, equipped to modern standards, and that we 
retain conscription." Freedom and peace could can still not be 
obtained free of charge, as the example of Yugoslavia shows. 
Setbacks in the reform process in Russia would have 
"unforese+eable consequences." Kohl therefore rejected "rash 
number games lacking sufficient thought" about the size of the 
Bundeswehr. 
  In the Defense Ministry, Kohl's statements are being viewed 
in the context of Finance Minister's Theo Waigel's (Christian 
Social Union) announcement next week setting overall minimum 
expenditure for individual budgets. It appears that the defense 
budget is now taboo in the eyes of the chancellor. 
  In the Federal Chancellery, it is also being said that Kohl 
is still convinced of the need for an effective military. 
Nevertheless, that does not mean that Volker Ruehe will receive 
more than the budget of 48.6 billion German marks [DM] that has 
been allocated for this year. 
  However, according to information that DIE WELT has obtained 
from the Defense Ministry, if the budget of DM48.6 billion is 
not increased, the Bundeswehr will be reduced from 370,000 to 
350,000 by the end of this year, because of a shortage of money. 
  A reduction of 20,000 from the level of 370,000 is the limit 
for a "structurally neutral range" for the armed forces. What 
that means is that a reduction of 20,000 can be absorbed without 
having to change Bundeswehr structures or conscription being 
jeopardized.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "CDU Presidiums Express </F>
`Anger Over Waigel'"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- A continuation of the dispute between the 
CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and CSU [Christian Social 
Union] is expected at today's meeting of the CDU/CSU Bundestag 
Group and at the weekend meeting of the CDU's ruling bodies. 
  Speaking to DIE WELT, members of the CDU Presidium expressed 
"anger over Waigel," because, at a conference in Wildbad Kreuth 
last weekend, the CSU prematurely and without discussing the 
matter with the CDU announced that the constitutional judge, 
Roman Herzog, 59, would be the CSU's candidate for president. 
  Heinz Eggert, deputy chairman of the CDU and Saxony's 
interior minister, described the actions of the CSU as "a mass 
of ineptitude" and said that the CSU debate about who should 
succeed Weizsaecker was "a disaster." Horst Eylmmann, chairman 
of the Bundestag Law Commission, termed the CSU's haste "unwise" 
and "politically stupid." 
  There are differences of opinion between Chancellor Kohl and 
his general secretary, Peter Hintze, about whether Herzog should 
be invited to the meeting of the CDU presidium and executive 
board of directors at the weekend at which Weizsaecker's 
succession is to be discussed. Kohl does not want Herzog to 
attend. Hintze is in favor of Herzog attending as a guest. 
  In a radio interview, Friedrich Bohl (CDU), chief of the 
federal chancellery, tried to tone things down. He sees "no 
confrontation course between the CDU and the CSU." 
  CSU leader Theo Waigel, who telephoned Kohl on Sunday [10 
January], said yesterday that there were "no differences 
whatsoever" between him and Chancellor Kohl. "I cannot explain 
the uproar here and there at all." 
  The schedule has been fixed. First, both leaderships will 
discuss Herzog separately, and then together, on 24 January. 
His official nomination by the CDU and CSU is to take place at 
a conference in March. Last weekend, the chancellor voiced 
annoyance over the statements made by the CSU as well as over 
the criticism of the CSU expressed by General Secretary Peter 
Hintze. 
  Nevertheless, it was being said at the Chancellor's Office 
that the CSU wanted to "conceal its own weakness" by toying with 
ideas about making the party a national one and about the 
dissolution of the joint Bundestag group in the event that a 
grand coalition is formed.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Consternation in the CDU/CSU </F>
Following Schaeuble's Speech"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union]/CSU [Christian Social Union] 
Bundestag Group, has called on the the CDU and CSU to urgently 
display unity. At a meeting of the CDU/CSU Bundestag Group 
yesterday, he said: "There is nothing that we need less than 
for public opinion to perceive the CDU/CSU as lacking unity and 
being in disagreement." Regarding the latest dispute between 
the CDU and CSU over the early announcement of the future 
CDU/CSU presidential candidate, Roman Herzog, Schaeuble said 
that he did not want to raise the issue once again. 
  However, at a meeting of the group's executive board the 
previous evening, he clearly set out his position on the 
dispute. CDU General Secretary Peter Hintze said that he would 
also have preferred a more orderly procedure for presenting 
Herzog as the presidential candidate. Some of the party is now 
annoyed with Hintze for having made CSU Chairman Theo Waigel's 
mistake of speaking about Herzog too soon a public issue. 
Michael Glos, chairman of the CSU Land Group, was also present 
but did not take part in the debate. A former CDU minister 
said: "It was not a professional political job. We have a 
difficult election year ahead of us. Every dispute is 
unnecessary." 
  Schaeuble issued an appeal to deputies in the same vein. He 
said that the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] has 
created an "impression of unity" since its party congress in 
Wiesbaden. For the first time in a long time, it now stood a 
chance of winning power. There is "dissatisfaction" in the 
population with those "who bear responsibility for the 
government." The population now believes that a change of 
government following the Bundestag election is "possible or 
likely." The group chairman said: "The combination of red and 
green no longer frightens people." 
  If public opinion continues to perceive the CDU/CSU and the 
coalition as disunited that will have "serious consequences." 
Schaeuble warned: "Citizens rightly want action instead of 
disputes. Every disagreement harms the coalition partners." 
  Some deputies reacted to Schaeuble's warnings with 
consternation. Deputy Herbert Werner openly criticized 
Schaeuble's, saying that it provided little motivation. Other 
members of the Bundestag said that it was not a speech to mark 
the beginning of election year. In addition, Schaeuble did not 
even mention the chancellor once. 
  Schaeuble, who wants to shake up the CDU/CSU, did, however, 
set out his program at the meeting of the group's executive 
board. He said that the CDU/CSU has to be particularly active 
in four areas: economic and employment policy; foreign, defense, 
and EU [European Union] policy; domestic security policy, and 
the strengthening of the family. Schaeuble said: "There are 
very few areas in which the CDU/CSU has to make it clear that it 
is more competent."

<F P=106> [Speech by Italian Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to </F>
Italian Parliament on no-confidence motion -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed honorable speaker, esteemed honorable 
members of the Chamber of Deputies. Having reached this stage 
in the debate, I think all the groups have assumed their 
responsiblities and that the positions are now clear. I thank 
the members of Parliament who proposed confirming confidence in 
the Government. I acknowledge that the deputies who tabled the 
no-confidence motion eventually withdrew their signatures. 
  On the other hand, the motion itself -- considering the way 
it was tabled and its origin -- shows that there are conflicting 
and diverging opinions in Parliament on what it is necessary to 
do. I also would like to thank all the groups which, from 
different political sides, have expressed their approval of the 
program that the Government has implemented, or of the way the 
Government has worked. 
  However, we cannot help considering the fact that, in spite 
of the widespread approval of the Government's action, there 
have also been deep divisions on the future of the 11th 
legislature, which were confirmed by the debate. In some 
respects the divisions have become deeper. This schism also 
casts doubts on whether there are the necessary conditions for 
Parliament to continue productive work. This question, which 
concerns the future of the legislature, is a crucial point. It 
cannot be overcome with a vote. This is not a matter which 
concerns the Government, either in the political or in the 
institutional sphere. 
  In order to allow all the constitutional responsibilities to 
be fully implemented, so that a definitive clarification may be 
obtained, after a Cabinet meeting, I will go and see the head of 
state in order to brief him on what emerged from this debate. 
  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, esteemed honorable deputies, for the 
example that this assembly has given to all citizens through 
this debate. An example of absolute loyalty [words indistinct] 
to our republic and to its history, and hope for its future. 
Thank you.

<F P=106> [Barbara Palombelli report: " Ciampi Says: `I, the Temporary </F>
Politician'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "Abroad there is admiration, respect, and 
hope for what Italy is doing...." Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was 
speaking on the 8 o'clock television news. He answered Demetrio 
Volcic's "political" questions and relaunched our country's 
image. And yet, it is difficult, if not impossible, to 
understand what is going badly: no-confidence motions, 
presented in order to obtain confidence; calls for confidence 
which serve to dissolve parliament; incredible discussions on 
the date of the elections, even before the mechanisms for 
setting the necessary procedures in motion have been found. 
Meetings of senior parliamentarians which go on for hours. 
Constitutionalists and political brains attempting to stage a 
debate, which first of all will take place, then perhaps will 
not, and finally will, but beginning in the afternoon. The 
prime minister who, it seemed, was to open this phantom debate, 
giving a speech, the lines of which were already traced out. 
The prime minister who decided -- at the "institutional" 
experts' suggestion -- to take his time and to let [Radical 
leader] Marco Pannella open the D-day. 
  What is going on in the Roman power palaces? And what do the 
head of state and the head of government have in mind? What 
lies behind the present crazy institutional mayonnaise? 
Ciampi's plan is at the same time simple, and extremely 
difficult to implement. Nor is it a secret plan, far from it. 
He himself unveiled it publicly at Montecitorio [parliament] on 
21 September last year: "Once we have completed our principal 
missions, we will be ready to hand over. But citizens and 
economic players, both Italian and foreign, need to be certain 
that this passage will be from a stable government to an even 
more solid one. In any event we will not let ourselves be 
overcome by nervous impatience, we will not give way to artful 
accelerations, nor will we slow down the government's action. We 
will continue to work with the best of our strength, in the 
fullness of the tasks and powers which the Constitution 
provides, and we will not shirk, by postponement, from 
confronting all the problems which will have to be resolved in 
the interest of the country." 
  A government at the height of its powers. A dissolved 
parliament, at least two-thirds of which had to be renewed. A 
civil, correct election campaign, in which the government would 
refrain from taking any position, continuing its work of 
rebirth. Will [President] Scalfaro and Ciampi complete their 
course successfully? At Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's 
office], they explain that it is absolutely "essential to avoid 
a period of instability in Italy. We are under observation on 
the world stage; one false move and, bang, they will close the 
door in our face, interest rates will rise on our huge debts, 
followed by new costs and new taxes. Nor should be forgotten 
that Ciampi's government is the first one since 1978 to have 
succeeded in getting the budget approved by a large majority." 
The ungovernability spiral, according to Ciampi's men, will not 
stop for one minute after the vote. The next elections, all the 
experts forecast, will be followed by a difficult phase in which 
it will not be at all easy to put together a new majority. Nor 
will the birth of the first government of the 11th legislative 
period be self-evident. But as soon as this is possible, they 
assure us, Carlo Azeglio will relinquish the chair of office. 
  Could it be that he has grown fond of the job of prime 
minister? On the plane bringing him back from Rome after the 
three-day mission to Brussels, the head of government replied: 
"When I was governor of the Bank of Italy, I used to refer to 
my role with the words `governor in office.' And when, during 
the preparations for the bank's centenary celebrations, I stated 
that these would be carried out by the governor in office, my 
colleagues thought that I was joking. And yet it was indeed my 
successor who had the task of celebrating the bank's century. 
And in the same way, today I am the `prime minister in office.' 
There is a continuity about institutions and one has to 
approach the job with the same commitment as if one were to 
remain there all one's life, but be ready to leave at any time." 
He then went on to conclude: "We are all temporary workers, 
but we must not live in a temporary fashion."

  [Excerpts] The last act of the First Republic began today: 
the debate at the Chamber on the no-confidence motion. The 
prime minister will go to the Quirinale [presidency of the 
republic] tomorrow morning, and most probably, the head of state 
will dissolve the chambers after a very brief round of talks. 
We shall go to the polls in little more than two months. 
[passage omitted] 
  Let us start with this report from the Chamber of Deputies: 
  [Begin Ciampi recording] [passage omitted] This government 
cannot be linked to any of the groupings that are emerging in 
this changing political landscape. That applies first and 
foremost to me personally. This is a natural passage, which we 
had forecast; it is not an abrupt change. The path is a 
difficult one but it is clearly traced. Some things have become 
irreversible. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent Francesco Pionati] This was Ciampi's 
statement. After his speech, the situation changed very much. 
There are two important new facts. First, the Socialist group 
clearly split in two. Some people say that it is a real 
division. The majority of Socialist deputies, including Craxi, 
elected a new parliamentary leader, Franco Piro. However, this 
election was not accepted by Ottaviano Del Turco. For the 
secretary of the Socialist Party the leader of the parliamentary 
group is still Nicola Capria. The division was caused by 
political reasons. On one side are those who want the 
legislature to continue and who look to the Center: this is the 
group that elected Piro. On the other side are those who look 
to the Left. They want this legislature to end right now: this 
is the group supporting Capria. The second important fact of 
the day was sparked by the Socialist split. The parties of the 
coalition in power prepared and presented a majority motion in 
which they confirmed their confidence in the government and in 
which they asked that some particularly urgent bills be 
approved. If this motion is approved, it will clearly be more 
difficult for Scalfaro to dissolve the chambers. As everyone 
can understand, the situation is tense and quite confused. The 
debate itself was full of contradictions. Some -- like the 
Christian Democrats -- want the legislature to continue. Some 
others -- the Democratic Party of the Left and the Northern 
League -- want the immediate end of the legislature. As for 
Pannella, he alone called for a new government to be formed. 
[passage omitted] Let us now listen to the reactions of the 
main political leaders, starting with their comments on the 
majority motion: 
  [Sacco] This is the document motion you presented. You want 
to give a confidence vote to Ciampi. What do you want and who 
signed the motion? 
  [Ferri] We Social Democrats signed it, but also the 
Christian 
Democrats with Gerardo Bianco, leader of the Christian 
Democratic parliamentary group, and Savino Melillo, leader of 
the Liberal group. We are waiting for the signature of the 
Socialists. The new leader, Piro, agreed with us on the main 
points. However, he will hold a meeting of his group, which is 
the right thing to do. There are also some members of the 
Republican Party. 
  [Sacco] What does that document say? 
  [Ferri] It says, first of all, that the government has 
created the conditions to continue his political and 
institutional work on some crucial points, as the vote of 
Italians abroad and the electoral reform for the European 
elections. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Bianco, the Christian Democrats say that 
the Ciampi government could and should carry on, but until when? 
  [Bianco] I repeat that we think that the most logical thing 
to do is to vote in June at the same time as the Europan 
elections, and I think that other political forces agree with 
us. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] There are rumors that there will also be a 
confidence motion presented by some or by all groups of the 
majority coalition. 
  [Bianco] Many colleagues already withdrew their signatures 
from Pannella's no-confidence motion, which somehow prompted 
this debate. 
  [Bossi] No, not the League. The League wants elections. All 
this is not wise at all. The Christian Democrats are buying 
time. They hope that some miracle may save them, that the 
elections may be avoided. 
  [Fini] Ciampi was honest. I hope he goes to see the 
president to resign and that the president of the republic 
allows Ciampi -- after his resignation but still in charge of 
the government for the ordinary administration -- to lead Italy 
to elections as soon as possible. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that the prime minister will 
resign or not? 
  [Occhetto] I think -- having listened to his speech, in 
which 
he quite rightly focused on the real problem, not the relation 
between parliament and the government, as Pannella thinks, but 
the relation between parliament and the country -- that in fact 
he has called for the end of this legislature. He put himself 
above parties, the government can guarantee a safe and peaceful 
passage to a new era in the life of the country. This can be 
done only if he goes immediately to see the president of the 
republic, if conclusions are reached and if elections are called. 
  [Studio Announcer Frajese] What will happen tomorrow? What 
is the institutional procedure? Fabrizio Ferragni reports from 
the Quirinale: 
  [Ferragni] The next moves are now clearer, even though 
nothing is certain. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will 
probably come here to the Quirinale late tomorrow morning to 
inform Scalfaro about what happened. He will also put his 
mandate at the disposal of Scalfaro. The day after, 14 January, 
the president of the republic may hold talks separately with 
Giovanni Spadolini, speaker of the Senate, and with Giorgio 
Napolitano, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. This is what 
Article 88 of the Constitution, which deals with the dissolving 
of the chambers, says. After a pause on 15 January, the head of 
state may sign the decree dissolving the chambers. The cabinet 
would then have to decide on the date of the elections. It is 
almost certain that they will be held on Sunday, 27 March.

  [Excerpts] The debate on the no-confidence motion presented 
against the government of [Carlo Azeglio] Ciampi is continuing 
in the Chamber of Deputies. Let us link up with Francesco 
Pionati. 
  [Pionati] Yes, the debate is taking place in a confused 
atmosphere. At the end of this morning, Ciampi will go to the 
Quirinale Palace [President's office] in order to hand his 
resignation to the Head of State [Oscar Luigi Scalfaro], who 
then has the task of dissolving the chambers and calling fresh 
elections. 
  This morning the differences between the ruling coalition 
parties, that want the legislature to continue -- a view 
supported by [Savino Melillo] from the Liberal Party and by 
[Enrico] Ferri from the Social Democratic Party who both spoke 
this morning, and the opposition parties that, on the other 
hand, want the chambers dissolved and elections to take place by 
the end of March, became apparent once again. [passage omitted] 
  [Giorgio] Napolitano and Ciampi will be the last two to 
speak 
at the debate. At 1200, there will be a meeting of the 
political groups making up the ruling coalition, which want to 
propose a confidence motion in the government. However, this 
proposal now seems out of the question. So all in all, the 
debate is proceeding in this climate of confusion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League representative </F>
Gianfranco Miglio by Guido Passalacqua in Milan; date not given: 
"Miglio Throws In the Towel: `No Hope for Italy'"] 
  [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Passalacqua] 
Professor, Bossi is abandoning federalism in order to attract 
the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. What do you think of that? 
  [Miglio] I do not criticize him. I go even further. The 
stance that he adopted recently has released certain 
uncertainties that I have nurtured for the past six months. We 
will never succeed in introducing a federalist Constitution in 
Italy. The North has been tainted by the South, which expects, 
and wants nothing more than, a welfare state. There is nothing 
to be done about it; that is the way the Italian people are, and 
that goes for me too. My friends in the League have not 
succeeded in doing anything to curb this tendency; they have 
merely been able to provide some kind of response to people's 
protests. 
  [Passalacqua] Was this all expected? Were you not the author 
of the Assago blueprint, which envisaged an Italy cut up into 
pieces? 
  [Miglio] The institutions of the First Republic were the 
only 
ones suited to the Italians who were comfortable in that state, 
and who remain so. 
  [Passalacqua] Which is why Bossi is turning toward 
regionalism... 
  [Miglio] Regionalism will not alter the situation much, 
because even if it is implemented, it will merely increase the 
influence of the welfare state... 
  [Passalacqua] So the federalism thrown out of the door will 
come back in through the window... 
  [Miglio] Yes, it is the only blueprint that enables Italy to 
be a respectable state. Now, however, I realize that I made a 
mistake, like inspector Rock on that television commercial many 
years ago. To have imagined a different order for Italy -- the 
federal order. The fact is that only a terrible economic and 
financial crisis could lead to federalism, but I really do not 
hope for such an end. 
  [Passalacqua] You seem embittered, professor. 
  [Miglio] A political scientist must tell the truth. I am a 
realist. 
  [Passalacqua] Does your realism now prompt you to say 
farewell to Parliament? 
  [Miglio] I am thinking about it, but this is not my foremost 
thought. I will stay on only if it is possible to change the 
system, but I am sure that there is nothing that can be done. 
  [Passalacqua] So are you totally pessimistic? 
  [Miglio] The system seems to me unchangeable. Despite all 
its defects and misdeeds. 
  [Passalacqua] Why? 
  [Miglio] From within, I can see the real nature of the 
Italian people who have always enjoyed excessive welfare 
benefits and are therefore unable to engage in a market economy. 
Do you know what I am going to tell you? We should not have 
signed the Maastricht Treaty, since we will be forced to violate 
them. 
  [Passalacqua] You are saying farewell to politics, and think 
that it is impossible to change anything. At the same time 
Bossi is seeking agreements with [Pact for Italy ideologue] 
Buttiglione, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and [Rooting for 
Italy leader] Berlusconi. It is legitimate to suspect that 
there is no complete concordance of views between you.... 
  [Miglio] Once again it is I who am imparting a profound 
significance to Bossi's options. If my analysis is correct, all 
this feverish activity on the part of the liberal democratic 
alignment is a waste of time. 
  [Passalacqua] Is it your realism that prompts you to bury 
the 
alignment for freedom even before it is born? 
  [Miglio] Indeed, the left-wing alignment will win. 
  [Passalacqua] Is there no hope? 
  [Miglio] Berlusconi and Segni are very likely to lose, short 
of a miracle. 
  [Passalacqua] Do you think the same about Berlusconi as 
[resigning IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli does? 
  [Miglio] Montanelli is a cynic; I am a skeptic. 
  [Passalacqua] But whom do you side with in the dispute 
between Montanelli and Berlusconi? 
  [Miglio] If I were a newspaper publisher, I would expect the 
editor to follow my general line. 
  [Passalacqua] Professor, how does the League regard the 
situation? 
  [Miglio] The League is fine. 
  [Passalacqua] Before Assago you used to describe Bossi as a 
crazy bruiser. What about now? 
  [Miglio] He is fine. 
  [Passalacqua] Many interpret your remarks as not very veiled 
criticisms of Bossi. 
  [Miglio] Utter nonsense. 
  [Passalacqua] Would you kindly give us your description of 
Bossi. 
  [Miglio] A great extemporizing leader with a great intuition 
with respect to political phenomena. 
  [Passalacqua] You said "extemporizing." For some time there 
has been increasing criticism of Bossi's oscillations. In LA 
REPUBBLICA yesterday, Giorgio Bocca said that if you fool around 
too much in politics you will suffer a pratfall.... 
  [Miglio] A large number of people vote for the League 
because 
that is the way Bossi is. 
  [Passalacqua] But the phenomenon of rejection does exist; it 
cannot be denied. 
  [Miglio] These things will undergo the acid test in the 
elections. I read Bocca's charges against Bossi: He said that 
we lack a strong program focus. He regrets the passing of 
localism. But, you see, when we were localists we were 
criticized. The League, remember, has always found a political 
identity in the electoral melting pot. Bossi thinks up the 
watchwords and points of policy at public rallies. So, my dear 
Bocca, have no fear. When the right moment comes, political 
identities will emerge. 
  [Passalacqua] Bocca said that the League is finished as a 
major political force. 
  [Miglio] Nonsense. Right now I do not think that the only 
option is to vote for the League. People know that we deserve 
their votes.

  [Text] Vatican, Jan 12 (AFP) -- Pope John Paul II urged 
the international community Wednesday [12 January] to disarm the 
"aggressor" in the war in former Yugoslavia where, he said, 
human rights are being continually ignored. 
  "The Vatican is alway raising the issue of humanitarian 
intervention," the pope said in a written statement during his 
weekly audience. "That doesn't necessarily mean military 
intervention, but rather undertaking any action aimed at 
`disarming' the aggressor." 
  He did not elaborate on which party he meant by `aggressor' 
and what sort of action should be taken to stop the war in 
Bosnia. 
  "According to the moral teachings of the Church, any 
military 
aggression is considered morally wrong," he said. "But 
legitimate defense is, on the contrary, considered acceptable 
and even a duty at times." 
  Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said that the pontiff 
believes that the international community is currently in a 
position to apply self defense in dealing with the Balkan war 
but that all other peaceful possibilities must be exhausted 
before resorting to military force. 
  He stressed that the pope's written opinion on the matter 
was 
drafted prior to the two-day NATO summit held in Brussels 
earlier this week. 
  Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said at 
the 
end of the summit Tuesday that they were ready to use air power 
in support of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina but appeared in 
agreement on applying such power only in two small Moslem 
enclaves where Serb forces have obstructed the United Nations. 
  In his statement Wednesday, the pope also condemned the 
warring parties in the Bosnian conflict, saying that they were 
openly violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
  "These rights are being violated in a frightening and tragic 
manner and those responsible have resorted to justifying their 
actions by saying they are obeying orders and certain 
ideologies," the pope said. 
  On Tuesday the Vatican also condemned the international 
community's inaction in Bosnia, saying it was acting in a 
criminally negligent manner.

  [Text] Italy lacks at least three million jobs. This is a 
"structural" disadvantage compared to other European countries 
which, together with a low level of education, makes the Italian 
situation especially difficult. This was said by Labor Minister 
Giugni at the presentation of a study of medium-term prospects 
for the labor market. 
  Giugni said that in October employment fell by 550,000 units 
compared with October 1992 and numbers unemployed increased by 
350,000 units, while the unemployment rate went up from 9.7 
percent to 11.3 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Cesar Camacho: "The `Dance' of the Generals"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The minister of defense will have to choose a 
new Armed Forces Chief of Staff (CEMGFA) to replace Soares 
Carneiro, who is leaving that post on 25 January. The method 
prescribed for choosing his successor requires that profiles of 
the general officers be previously drafted. This applies to Army 
Chief of Staff Cerqueira Rocha, Defense Policy Director 
Goncalves Ribeiro, and the head of the Portuguese Military 
Mission in NATO, Gabriel Espirito Santo. These last two men are 
Army officers. 
  In the Navy, Admiral Fuzeta de Ponte is the leading 
candidate 
for the four gold stars, representing the highest level 
achievable in a military career. Those next at the starting gate 
might be Admirals Moreira Rato and Machado da Silva. The latter 
was passed over in favor of Fuzeta de Ponte at the time of the 
appointment of the Naval Chief of Staff. 
  The leading choice within the ranks of the Portuguese Air 
Force (FAP) is obviously its current commander, Narciso Mendes 
Dias. Not so obvious is whether its second candidate will be 
chosen from this branch. The FAP Council of Generals might well 
repeat the earlier action that put General Soares Carneiro in 
his post as CEMGFA, when it included an Army officer as one of 
the two candidates it proposed. Based on this model, there would 
then be the possibility of a third recommendation from the Army, 
in the person of Goncalves Ribeiro. 
  Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira has announced a 
proposal that the government amend the Defense and Armed Forces 
Law prior to the end of the year. The changes envisioned would 
modify the mechanisms for appointing the military commanders in 
chief. However, because the legislative calendar is so crowded, 
it will be hard to get this proposal on the agenda of the 
Assembly of the Republic, where it will require the approval of 
a majority of two-thirds of the deputies, for debate. 
  As of the date of General Soares Carneiro's retirement from 
this post, it will be filled on an interim basis by Admiral 
Fuzeta de Ponte, the General Staff chief who has served the 
longest. Fernando Nogueira is known to oppose lengthy interim 
appointments, particularly when basic changes are being made to 
the military structure. 
  On the basis of this information, the minister of defense 
himself has admitted that the next appointment of an Armed 
Forces commander will still come under the provisions of the 
current law. It therefore will fall to each military branch to 
submit to the Council of Commanders and the minister the names 
of two general officers, making a total of six. From this group, 
the minister will choose the individual whose name will be 
submitted for approval to the Council of Ministers, first, and 
to the president of the Republic subsequently. 
<H5>  Different Readings </H5>
  This provision of the law requiring that each military 
branch 
submit the names of two three- or four-star generals for 
consideration by the government is not interpreted in the same 
way by all of the military. According to one interpretation, 
regarded as "typically corporative" in some circles, says that 
the higher councils in each branch always prefer a choice from 
that branch. The Navy chooses naval personnel, the FAP chooses 
pilots, the Army chooses from among its own, and the final 
choice is regarded as a victory for the branch represented. 
  According to the other interpretation, which is supported by 
certain general officers, reliance is placed in the choice 
process solely on "command records, technical abilities, and 
diplomatic skills." This means that nothing would prevent the 
naval commanders from voting for their counterparts in the Air 
Force or the Army, and vice versa. 
  In the case pertaining to the choice of Soares Carneiro's 
successor now under discussion, the present indicators justify 
the assumption that the FAP is the military branch least eager 
for the four gold stars the CEMGFA post entails, while the Navy 
makes no secret of its advocacy of the principle of rotation 
among the branches. 
  An officer on Fuzeta de Ponte's staff made the following 
statement. "It has been 30 years now since the highest post in 
the Armed Forces has been held by a naval officer. This might 
create the impression that we do not have qualified people." In 
fact, in the post-25 April era, the post was shared by the Army 
and the Air Force. General Ramalho Eanes took over the post of 
CEMGFA for himself when he was president of the Republic, and it 
then went to Air Force General Lemos Ferreira, and later to 
Soares Carneiro, of the Army. 
<H5>  The Classic Model </H5>
  Technically, all three- and four-star generals are eligible. 
The four-star generals are now serving as the commanders in 
chief of the branches (Fuzeta de Ponte, Mendes Dias, and 
Cerqueira Rocha), and as president of the Supreme Military 
Tribunal (Admiral Ceregeiro). 
  The practice to date has been for each branch to choose its 
commander and his deputy as its nominees. An exception occurred 
precisely with the appointment of the present CEMGFA. In that 
instance, the Air Force broke away from the classic model by 
including the name of Army General Soares Carneiro on its list 
instead of its deputy commander. 
  There is nothing to prevent this precedent from being 
repeated, nor to bar the Navy from setting its sights on a more 
distant target. Continued control of the CEMGFA by the Army, 
which is more than an academic hypothesis, may depend on whether 
the Air Force decides to include the name of General Goncalves 
Ribeiro on its list. 
  If this scenario should be realized, the minister would have 
to choose from a group including three Army generals, two naval 
officers, and one from the Air Force. Fernando Nogueira would 
certainly not fail to welcome the implicit suggestion made by 
the FAP. This is the branch that will have to work very closely 
with the Army in the next three years, mainly because of the 
rebellion of the Airborne Brigade, and the creation of the Army 
Aviation Group. 
  Fernando Nogueira's advisers at the Ministry of Defense are 
saying that it is still too early to comment on the choice to be 
made. One thing is certain--the minister will not fail to heed 
the opinion of the outgoing chief. Just as he will listen to the 
generals nominated by each branch individually. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Gabriel Espirito Santo </H5>
  Gabriel Augusto do Espirito Santo received his promotion to 
the rank of general on 23 January 1991. In April of that year, 
he was appointed to serve as Portugal's permanent representative 
on the NATO Military Committee in Brussels. A man of 57, he is a 
member if the group of generals who know the Army best. The 
posts he has held in the most recent years of his career, have 
provided him with skills in the areas of military doctrine and 
geostrategy. These skills are also the foundations for becoming 
a noted analyst of the political aspects of military and defense 
issues. 
  Espirito Santo is a member of the NATO Defense College, is 
experienced in the planning of forces, and has qualified in all 
of the General Staff disciplines and the command and leadership 
courses. He has already been instructed to return to Lisbon at 
the beginning of January. The appointment of his successor in 
Brussels will have greatly to do with what turmoil develops in 
the Armed Forces when General Soares Carneiro is succeeded by 
another officer. 
  As Gabriel Espirito Santo leaves Brussels, it is highly 
probable that the operational command of the Army will be 
entrusted to him. The CEMGFA post is not in his future plans. 
  Since he is the chief advisor to Minister Fernando Nogueira, 
it is quite likely that Soares Carneiro will be the director 
general of defense policy in the future if his strategy with 
regard to his successor has sufficient weight. That post is 
currently held by General Goncalves Ribeiro, who is also in a 
position to be included on the list of six nominees Nogueira 
will read. It is certain that although he is not a candidate for 
the post of CEMGFA, Gabriel Espirito Santo has a place on the 
board on which the game of choosing a successor is being played. 
<H5>  Octavio Cerqueira Rocha </H5>
  Octavio Gabriel Calderon de Cerqueira Rocha will be on the 
list of recommendations that the Army will make submit to the 
minister of defense. The general won his fourth silver star when 
he was appointed to serve as Army Chief of Staff (CEME) on 12 
October 1992, when he was 60. Two months ago, his only desire 
was to continue his reorganization work in the Army. But the 
vacancy in Restelo is calling more loudly. 
  If the government chooses to keep the highest command post 
in 
the Armed Forces in the hands of the land branch, Cerqueira 
Rocha leads the list of probable choices to succeed Soares 
Carneiro. An enviable career in the command and leadership areas 
and his short term of service as CEME speak well for him. 
  He is sufficiently qualified technically, and he enjoys a 
reputation as a "good negotiator." And he is a man with a great 
capacity for human relationships. "He is a person for whom 
friendship is a sacred value," says one of his comrades from his 
Academy days. But the post under consideration is the most 
political of any on the top military leadership level. 
  Cerqueira Rocha comes from a family with a tradition of 
career military service on the paternal side and connections 
with arts and letters on the maternal side. The general did not 
feel that he shared the talent of his grandfather, Leandro 
Calderon, a painter, nor that of his granduncle, Carlos 
Calderon, who was one of the founders of the Portuguese Authors 
Society. A career in the military won out. 
  The only things against him would be factors outside his own 
personality or professional qualifications. Among these is the 
fact that he has headed the Army for just a little over a year, 
a term of service he launched with his own three-year program. 
<H5>  Antonio Fuzeta de Ponte </H5>
  Antonio Carlos Fuzeta de Ponte is 58 years old, and he has 
been Chief of the Naval General Staff since 4 March 1991. He was 
born in Setubal in 1934, and enrolled in the Naval School at the 
age of 18, fleeing the family's dedication to the legal 
sciences. While he was still at home, the family pointed him 
toward architecture as a career. He also enrolled in the 
Conservatory of Music, an experience from which he retains a 
love of the piano. He was in Brussels serving as head of the 
Portuguese mission to NATO when he was appointed to the number 
one post in the Navy. 
  He has already survived some tribulations in that branch, 
both before and after becoming its commander in chief. An 
interesting episode is recounted in a short biographical sketch 
written by Rosa Pedroso Lima (EXPRESSO). When Fuzeta de Ponte 
was serving as civil governor of Setubal in 1977, Valentina 
Tereshkova, the only woman astronaut in the then USSR, came to 
Setubal as a guest of the PCP [Portuguese Communist Party]. The 
sponsors of the event wanted the flag of the USSR hoisted 
alongside the national banner, but Fuzeta de Ponte ruled that 
this would not be allowed. He was harshly criticized, but 
passions eventually cooled. 
  The most inflammatory incident since he took command of the 
Navy occurred recently in the Higher National Defense Council. 
General Carlos Azeredo, head of the Military Household of the 
President, berated him aloud because of his failure to promote 
Commander Homem de Gouveia, his subordinate in Belem. Azeredo 
accused him of bending to the will of the political authorities. 
His peers say that "Fuzeta has his faults, like everyone. He may 
be a vain man, but a stooge he is not! He is disciplined and 
competent." It is beyond question that he is fighting for the 
post of CEMGFA, from which the Navy has been excluded for many 
years now. 
<H5>  Narciso Mendes Dias </H5>
  Narciso Mendes Dias is a native of Vila de Rei, and will be 
58 years old in September. He has been the Air Force Chief of 
Staff (CEMFA) since November of 1991, when the minister of 
defense decided not to reappoint General Conceicao e Silva. He 
is a man who enjoys esteem within the FAP. If any reservations 
exist, they are to be found in certain sectors of the Parachute 
Troops Corps, which accuse him of "not having tried" to prevent 
the transfer of this unit to the Army. 
  Mendes Dias has succeeded in calming the protesters by 
invoking the principle to the effect that national interests 
override those of a personal and corps nature. And he has 
continued his frequent praise of the military contribution made 
by the parachute troops, which he says has added to the prestige 
of the Air Force. 
  His involuntary venture into the corridors of politics 
during 
the inflammatory days of the revolution failed to shake his 
confidence. When in October 1974, at the age of 39, he was 
called away from the Nacala Air Field, where he was in command, 
to join the National Salvation Council and to serve as the Air 
Force Chief of Staff, he accepted. He said that his only 
commitment "was to the country and to the military 
establishment." A short time afterward, Costa Gomes, who was 
then the president of the Republic, dismissed him, citing "lack 
of political confidence" as his reason. He is the general least 
eager to win the Restelo post for himself. Whenever he has the 
opportunity, he tells the minister that "you cannot make an 
omelet without eggs." He commands the newest military 
branch--that which, to a certain extent, is serving as a model 
for the modernization of the Armed Forces.

  [Text] In statements to this station, Spanish Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana has repeated his criticisms of the 
leaders of the three warring factions in Bosnia who are making 
the work of the UN blue helmets difficult. 
  Javier Solana said it is frustrating and a scandal to see 
how 
these political and military leaders disregard their own 
citizens by hindering the arrival of aid the citizens need to 
survive the severe winter. 
  The minister also referred to the visit his Algerian 
counterpart, Mohamed Salah Dembri, is making to Spain. Algeria, 
said Javier Solana, is a country going through severe political 
and economic problems, as well as suffering from terrorist 
violence. Algeria has a great potential; however, it needs help 
to develop. Solana added that risks to Spanish companies and 
citizens in Algeria have to be minimized.

visiting Spain, where he met King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister 
Felipe Gonzalez this morning. This afternoon he met the Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana. Algeria has asked Spain for cooperation 
in the fight against terrorism. Over to our diplomatic 
correspondent, Pedro Fernandez Cespedes. 
  [Cespedes] Good evening. Specifically, Algeria asked Spain 
to control the flux of people who might form terrorist groups or 
networks abroad. Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri 
added that Algeria's security is inseparable from that of other 
neighboring Mediterranean countries. According to Dembri, 
Algeria is not on the brink of civil war, as is often said in 
the media. He suggested to journalists they stop reporting on 
the Algerian situation in such a sensationalist way. 
  Spain, through its Foreign Minister Javier Solana, asked 
Algeria to solve its serious political crisis through a swift, 
open, and sincere dialogue, while at the same time offering its 
cooperation. 
  [Begin Solana recording] The fight against terrorism is not 
the fight of a single country. And so he Salah Dembri will have 
Spain's support in this battle. [end recording]

  [Text] Bilbao (Spain), 12 Jan (EFE) -- According to 
government sources, a bomb blast rocked the Mexican Consulate in 
Bilbao (northern Spain) without causing any great damage. 
  Government sources in Vizcaya Province reported that 
approximately 10 minutes before the explosion, an anonymous 
caller told police that a bomb was going to explode in the 
building where the consulate is located. No one was inside the 
consulate at the time of the blast. 
  Spanish police have sent explosives experts to the site to 
conduct an investigation. 
  Demonstrations have been organized in several parts of Spain 
in recent days to protest the Mexican Army's repression in the 
insurrection in Chiapas State, where peasants and Indians are 
demanding "land and freedom."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton and Europe"] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton has taken a year to come to 
Europe, a continent which has been essential to U.S. interests 
for the past five decades. Clinton, concerned primarily about 
domestic problems and lacking the international vision which 
characterized his predecessors, has thus encouraged in his first 
12 months in the White House the isolationist interpretations of 
those who believed that they were seeing their fears confirmed 
in the U.S. withdrawal in the main conflicts following the Cold 
War. And in this panorama, Europe has not only been no 
exception but seems to have been the clinching proof of U.S. 
diplomacy's new mood. 
  The Administration's first steps in relations with Europe 
have not been easy. For instance, in the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia, the Americans have moved from the initial 
interventionist declarations to passivity, but in this case the 
Europeans, handicapped by their own inaction, are not exactly in 
a position to cast the first stone. The strain in relations 
became clear in the interminable negotiations on the 
liberalization of international trade. GATT became a trial of 
strength between the Americans and Europeans, who in this way 
confirmed how trade is destined to become a weapon as essential 
as arms on the new international scene. 
  An agreement has been reached on the liberalization of 
trade, 
but the European leaders now receiving Clinton still have 
buzzing in their ears the repeated statements made by State 
Department officials citing Asia -- more specifically, the 
Pacific Basin, with Japan and China -- as the area of greatest 
importance for the United States in the 21st century; that is, 
rather as if the center of the world, which in the 20th century 
has lain between the United States, as the leading superpower, 
and Europe -- i.e. in the Atlantic community -- could shift to 
the Pacific, between Asia and America. And if to this view of 
the world we add European fears about a continental scene in 
which balance has given way to instability and conflicts, it is 
easy to understand the interest with which the European leaders 
awaited Bill Clinton. 
  The first consequence of the President's visit has served to 
reassure the allies. "I am here to declare and demonstrate that 
Europe is central to U.S. interests," asserted Clinton, who 
reckoned the U.S. commitment in terms of a military presence of 
100,000 servicemen and supported the European integration 
process. On defense, the Democratic President seems more 
prepared than his predecessors for the Europeans to have a more 
prominent role. And this, although it is also to be explained 
in terms of the United States' interest in cutting its military 
expenditure, represents an opportunity to reconsider relations 
between the allies on both sides of the Atlantic, because they 
are both confronted in the post-Cold War period with the 
challenge of renewing their bonds without weakening their ties. 
  Asia is emerging as a mainstay of trade in U.S. foreign 
policy for the future, but Europe has been this and should 
remain so, for the benefit of both the United States and Europe, 
with which it shares not only economic and security interests 
but also the defense of values based on respect for freedom, 
democracy, and human rights.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck by </F>
correspondent Sten Soederberg, including comment by Rear 
Admirral Sten Swedlund, chief of the Coastal Navy; place and 
date not given; from the "Echo" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck is very surprised 
over what Rear Admiral Sten Swedlund, the chief of the coastal 
navy, told the Echo [program] this morning. Swedlund is of the 
opinion that defense costs can be reduced and points out that 
the Russian threat is overestimated. Defense Minister Anders 
Bjoerck: 
  [Bjoerck] I have not been engaged on anything else other 
than 
ensuring that the problems that the navy has with its finances 
is fixed. It is a good thing if you look after your own [word 
indistinct] before you start talking about savings elsewhere. 
  [Soederberg] What do you mean? 
  [Bjoerck] I mean that the Navy has been carrying a budget 
deficit year after year. It has cost a lot of money to fix 
this, and it is a good thing if one manages to keep to one's 
budget before one starts to talk about cuts, as Swedlund does, 
even though he says that they should be in the long term. 
  [Soederberg] Sten Swedlund recently headed a naval visit to 
Russia. He was struck by the impression that the Russian Baltic 
Navy was way behind Swedish standards. Swedlund judges that a 
Russian invasion across the sea could not be carried out. In 
THE ECHO this morning, Swedlund said that the defense costs can 
be cut. 
  [Swedlund] I think that it is quite natural in a society 
like 
the Swedish one, where we now clearly experience that there are 
significant economic problems, that the defense economy should 
also be discussed. 
  [Soederberg] Sten Swedlund is chief of the coastal navy. 
Don't you think that his views should be taken seriously? 
  [Bjoerck] Of course, but he has not voiced any such views to 
me and I have had many talks with him. They have rather been 
about the opposite, more resources, more money for submarine 
hunts, and other things. It is only since the commander in 
chief recently told Swedlund that the time had come to change 
jobs and began to negotiate with him about another post that 
Swedlund, now that he is apparently leaving, is voicing views 
like this. 
  [Soederberg] But if highly placed military officials are not 
averse to cuts in the defense budget, how come that you are? 
  [Bjoerck] Swedlund is not at all representative of what 
Swedish military officials think in this respect. Now that the 
time has come for him to leave, he suddenly goes out to express 
his views on the operations he led in the past.

  [Text] Nicosia, Jan 12 (CNA)--The Cyprus government 
welcomes the fact that U.S. President Bill Clinton will 
personally handle the Cyprus problem, government spokesman 
Ioannis Kasoulidhis said here Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Clinton pledged to get personally involved immediately after 
the conclusion of his European tour this week. He made the 
pledge during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou and European Commission President Jacques Delors at 
the sidelines of the NATO summit in Brussels yesterday. 
  Kasoulidhis stated "the Cyprus government welcomes the fact 
that President Clinton, personally, and this is a great positive 
development for Cyprus, will handle the Cyprus problem." 
  He added the Greek Cypriot side should also think hard "as 
to 
the way we should responsibly handle our sincere objectives for 
a just and workable Cyprus settlement." 
  Asked whether President Glavkos Kliridhis was briefed on 
what 
exactly was stated by President Clinton, Kasoulidhis replied he 
based his statements on press reports from Brussels. 
  He said the government was in touch with the American State 
Department special Cyprus coordinator and the U.S. Embassy in 
Cyprus and no further contacts between the Cyprus and U.S. 
presidents were being fixed.

<F P=106> [Report by Stavros Angelidhis] </F>
  [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis is avoiding calling 
a meeting of the National Council to discuss the substance of 
the confidence-building measures so that the cards of the Greek 
Cypriot side are not revealed before the Turkish side responds. 
Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis made the above 
statement, arguing that nothing at the National Council meetings 
remains secret. However, in an attempt to lessen the pressure 
from AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] and EDEK 
[United Democratic Union of Cyprus] for an immediate convening 
of the National Council -- a view shared by DIKO [Democratic 
Party] Parliamentary Representative Tasos Papadhopoulos -- the 
president has decided to call the leaders of the four parties 
participating in the National Council to hold separate meetings 
for a "discussion of the latest developments in the Cyprus 
issue." Yesterday, the president met DIKO Chairman Spiros 
Kiprianou and today will meet Democratic Rally Chairman Ioannis 
Matsis, AKEL General Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias and EDEK 
Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis. 
  DIKO Chairman Kiprianou told O FILELEVTHEROS that during the 
meeting they had a general discussion of the latest developments 
concerning the Cyprus issue with special reference to the 
confidence-building measures and the reports of the UN experts 
on these measures. Kiprianou stressed that DIKO categorically 
rejects the proposed confidence-building measures and added that 
the reports of the UN experts give another, clearer picture of 
how dangerous these measures are. 
  Kiprianou added that the president had told him that he is 
not committed by the reports of the UN experts, and that he will 
wait for the response of the Turkish side on the three documents 
of the UN secretary general on the confidence-building measures. 
  For its part, EDEK followed the call of AKEL's General 
Secretary Khristofias Monday and repeated its demand for the 
immediate convening of the National Council, "so that the 
institution does not become obsolete" and questioned whether we 
can reach a solution without discussing the issue. EDEK claims 
that the confidence-building measures constitute a solution much 
worse than the current situation because they provide for two 
separate states, and have our own signature on it. 
  EDEK's statement notes that the UN experts' report gives a 
vivid picture of how destructive the confidence-building 
measures are. It also notes that: "Instead of realizing the 
decline that our national issue has undergone, the government 
continues to declare that it is ready to accept the 
confidence-building measures and that the only remaining issue 
in order to begin the dialogue is the Turkish side's acceptance. 
How can the government follow this line despite the opposite 
position being taken by all parties?" [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Basaran Duzgun] </F>
  [Text] The Republican Turkish Party and Democrat Party 
coalition government is working intensively to determine the 
policy to be followed on the Cyprus problem. 
  The Council of Ministers will meet under President Rauf 
Denktas on Thursday [13 January] to determine the policy course 
to be followed on the Cyprus problem. The Turkish Cypriot 
side's views will be clarified on the eve of the Ankara summit 
in February. 
<H5>  New Image </H5>
  A source close to the presidential office told our paper 
that 
the new government is thinking of approaching the Cyprus problem 
by displaying a new image and that this idea has been endorsed 
by President Denktas. Our source said that the new image is 
being conceived in the form of "We are ready for an agreement if 
the Greek side is ready too." 
<H5>  New Mandate for Denktas </H5>
  It is expected that during its Thursday meeting the Council 
of Ministers will decided to reappoint President Denktas as 
negotiator. As will be remembered, President Denktas had 
resigned as negotiator over differences of opinion with the 
Eroglu government. 
<H5>  Fundamental Guidelines Will Be Determined </H5>
  The Council of Ministers meeting to be chaired by President 
Denktas will also determine the fundamental guidelines that the 
Turkish side will insist upon during the talks. Sources close to 
the government summed up these guidelines as follows: "To exert 
efforts to achieve a mutually acceptable solution to the Cyprus 
problem. To continue with the talks within the framework of the 
UN goodwill mission. To defend the submission of the solution to 
be achieved to a referendum without fail. Not to reject 
territorial adjustments, but to approach them within the 
framework of the criteria set down in the 1977 Denktas-Makarios 
high-level meeting. To defend partnership in sovereignty, and in 
that context the Swiss model."

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today 
expressed the government's satisfaction with the results of the 
NATO summit in Brussels. Venizelos highlighted that Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou had the opportunity, at the highest 
level, to detail the positions of the European Union and those 
of the Greek Government on the big national issues of Skopje and 
Cyprus. 
  The spokesman regretted the grumbling and fabricated, as he 
put it, criticism by the opposition, which is implementing a 
strange policy that is out of place following the NATO summit. 
  In a statement on the results of the prime minister's 
contacts in Brussels, New Democracy discussed a lost 
opportunity. Political Spring also issued a statement claiming 
that the lack of a specific result on the Skopje issue indicates 
the prime minister's failure in his meeting with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. Replying to the New Democracy and Political 
Spring statements, the government spokesman said among other 
things that the opposition stance unfortunately doesn't match 
the circumstances and shows ignorance regarding developments in 
Brussels and the relevant diplomatic procedures.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters during his return flight from 
Brussels, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou expressed the hope 
that the Cyprus issue will be resolved soon. At the same time, 
Mr. Papandreou reiterated that the dialogue with Skopje could 
resume only if the conditions set by the Greek Government are 
met, adding that the splitting up of Skopje means a Balkan war. 
Our political correspondent Angeliki Angelopoulou has the 
following report. 
  [Angelopoulou] It appears from Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's statement, which he made during his return flight 
from Brussels, that the Greek side is awaiting a U.S. initiative 
for the solution of the Cyprus issue. 
  Asked if a solution is being planned, Mr. Papandreou gave 
answered in the affirmative and added that he does not know 
exactly what the solution is. He said: President Clinton 
personally considers the problem most important and he has 
already contacted the Turkish side to facilitate the process 
being promoted by the UN Secretary General. 
  The prime minister stressed: The problem has now also become 
important for Turkey. He also made it clear that no invitation 
had been extended for him to visit Ankara and said: Mr. Hikmet 
Cetin invited me unofficially. Papandreou added: A lot has to 
be done in order to start. 
  The prime minister described the negotiations on the Skopje 
issue as a dialogue in suspense and reiterated that the 
negotiations cannot continue unless the conditions set by the 
Greek Government are met. He added: We will explain this to 
Cyrus Vance if he proposes a resumption of the negotiations. 
  Mr. Papandreou also said that he is very satisfied with the 
results of the NATO summit and noted particularly that, 
following hard negotiations, the decision to undertake military 
operations in Bosnia was in the end not adopted.

statement by the Albanian Defense Ministry that last Monday [10 
January] Greek ships violated the Albanian territorial waters. 
  According to the spokesman, the sole purpose of the torpedo 
boat and the patrol ship posted in that area is to avert the 
entry of illegal immigrants into our country. 
  The Albanian Defense Ministry protested to the Greek 
authorities and noted that this was the 3d violation of the 
Albanian territorial waters by Greek ships in less than two 
months.

  [Text] The National Defense Ministry today denied press 
reports that there have been violations of the air traffic 
regulations in the Athens Flight Information Region as well as 
of the national airspace in the northern Aegean and specifically 
in the area of Thasos island. The National Defense Ministry 
statement made it clear that air traffic regulations had been 
violated south of Limnos and the established practice to deal 
with them was followed. 
  The issue has been given broad coverage in the Turkish press 
as it was linked to the underwater drilling being conducted near 
Thasos for the exploration of oil. But in an attempt to defuse 
the issue, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel admitted that the 
drilling is being conducted in Greek territorial waters. 
However, Demirel added that if the explorations extend beyond 
Greece's territorial waters there might be complications, since 
no agreement has been reached on the question of the Aegean 
continental shelf. 
  The Turkish Foreign Ministry denied through its spokesman 
that Greece's underwater drilling east of Thasos causes tension 
in Greek-Turkish relations.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] An official welcoming 
ceremony was held for Georgian head of State Eduard Shevardnadze 
at the Cankaya Mansion today. The ceremony began with the 
playing of the national anthems of the two countries. Later 
president Suleyman Demirel and Shevardnadze inspected the honor 
guard. 
  In a statement at the ceremony, Demirel said that Turkey 
wants to develop bilateral relations with friendly and brotherly 
Georgia in all fields. He added that he is happy to note that 
Georgia has the same wish. Pointing out that Turkey is ready to 
extend Georgia all the assistance it can and help Georgia 
benefit from its experience, Demirel added that the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation Organization should be considered a 
significant tool in achieving this goal. He said that Turkey is 
closely following and supports the struggle waged by friendly 
and brotherly Georgia in its period of transition, one which 
Georgia is implementing in a determined manner. Demirel 
continued: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] We have observed that our 
approaches to the solution of the problems of south Caucasian 
countries are identical. The problems should be solved without 
bloodshed and through lasting, peaceful, and sound means that 
can achieve stability. I would like to take this opportunity to 
once more state that these peaceful methods and steps to be 
taken toward the solution of the problems will contribute to 
regional cooperation. [end recording] 
  Shevardnadze said that he is very happy to be in Turkey as 
the guest of Demirel, who is one of the most important political 
figures of the era. Pointing out that his visit has created 
great expectations both in Georgia and the Caucasus, 
Shevardnadze added: It is impossible for Georgia to forget the 
aid extended by Turkey during its times of difficulty. 
Expressing the belief that the talks to be held and agreements 
to be signed in Ankara will contribute to bilateral relations 
and regional peace, Shevardnadze said: I am confident that with 
the help of our great neighbor, the Turkish Republic, peace and 
stability will be secured in the Caucasus. 
  Assembly Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk, Chief of Staff General 
Dogan Gures, Acting Prime Minister Necmettin Cevheri, Motherland 
Party leader Mesut Yilmaz and other officials were present at 
the welcoming ceremony. 
  After the ceremony, Demirel and Shevardnadze held meeting at 
the Cankaya Mansion. Later talks were held between the two 
delegations headed by Demirel and Shevardnadze. The Turkish 
delegation is composed of Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin; 
Interior Minister Nahit Mentese; Refaiddin Sahin, minister of 
agriculture and village affairs; Tahir Kose, minister of 
industry and commerce. The Georgian delegation is composed of 
Deputy Prime Minister Zurab Kervalishvili; Foreign Affairs 
Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze; Interior Minister Shote Kvaria; 
Giorgi Kvesitadze, minister of foodstuffs and processing. 
  Shevardnadze later received various officials. He first 
received Yilmaz for about half an hour. He later met with Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller. Cetin was also present at the meeting. 
He then received Sahin and conferred with him for some time. 
Shevardnadze this evening will attend a dinner Demirel will be 
hosting in his honor.

  [Text] Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze, 
currently visiting Ankara as the official guest of President 
Suleyman Demirel, concluded his contacts today. A friendship, 
cooperation, and solidarity declaration, as well as agreements 
and protocols envisaging bilateral cooperation in various 
fields, were signed in Ankara today. 
  In a statement at the signing ceremony, Demirel said that 
various international and regional issues, as well as bilateral 
relations, were discussed during the talks held in Ankara with 
the visiting head of state and his delegation. Recalling that a 
friendship, cooperation, and good-neighbor agreement was signed 
between Turkey and Georgia during his visit to Tbilisi last 
year, Demirel noted that the protocol signed today complements 
this agreement. The declaration, agreements, and protocols will 
further enrich the relations between the two countries, Demirel 
remarked. 
  Stressing that the Turkish-Georgian border is extremely 
active from an economic viewpoint, Demirel added: Our peoples 
know and love each other. It is up to us to create the 
necessary political and legal basis to expand this cooperation, 
and this is what we are doing. Demirel concluded by saying that 
Shevardnadze's visit turns a brand new page in bilateral 
relations. 
  Also addressing the signing ceremony, Shevardnadze declared 
that Turkey's importance in the region is constantly growing and 
attributed this to President Demirel's efforts. The talks in 
Ankara were extremely beneficial, Shevardnadze remarked, adding: 
We had the opportunity to refine our views with regard to the 
future of our bilateral relations. Shevardnadze stated that 
complete agreement was reached on all the regional issues raised 
during the talks. 
  After the speeches, protocols envisaging cooperation in the 
agricultural, economic, industrial, commercial, scientific, and 
technical fields, as well as an agreement on mutual assistance 
and cooperation in customs and a tourism cooperation agreement, 
were signed separately by the two countries' ministers. 
  Meanwhile, Demirel signed the [word indistinct] of (Noda 
Kamaitsi), Georgia's first ambassador to Ankara.

BOTAS officials on Wednesday [12 January] discussed the route of 
the petroleum coming from Russia, Caucasia and Central Asia.

energy field during Premier Tansu Ciller's visit to Moscow in 
September. 
  Uzun said the joint study group holds talks on eight 
possible 
routes adding they mainly focus on a route which comes from 
Russia to Caucasia than to Georgia or Armenia. 
  Answering another question Uzun said a bargain with Russia 
for the price of an additional supply of two billion cubic 
meters of natural gas was out of question.

  [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly, has declared that the establishment of an 
artificial state in the Middle East will further exacerbate the 
conflicts in the region. 
  Cindoruk received members of the U.S. Congress Defense 
Subcommittee. In a statement during the meeting, Cindoruk 
remarked that the international measures adopted regarding 
northern Iraq have failed to solve the problem and asked that 
the issue be reassessed. 
  [Begin Cindoruk recording] The current situation creates two 
sets of difficulties for Turkey. First, we have sustained great 
material damage because of the embargo. Second, the current de 
facto situation in northern Iraq makes it more difficult for 
Turkey to wage its struggle against terrorism, and furthermore, 
the region is a breeding ground for elements that seek to divide 
Turkey. [end recording] 
  John Murtha, chairman of the U.S. Congress Defense 
Subcommittee, declared that Turkey's importance is increasing 
with time because of world developments and the country's 
geopolitical position. 
  Meanwhile, National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan expressed 
concern over the U.S. decision to cease military aid and the 
7:10 ratio applied by the United States in its aid to Greece and 
Turkey. Golhan received Murtha and the delegation accompanying 
him. Pointing out that most of the equipment, machinery, and 
weapons used by the Turkish Armed Forces are U.S.-made, Golhan 
said that the decision to stop the aid should be reviewed within 
the context of common goals. 
  President Suleyman Demirel also received the visiting 
delegation at the Cankaya Mansion and conferred with its members 
for some time.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Schoendorfer: "Haider Challenges Vranitzky </F>
-- `Clean Up This Country Politically'"] 
  [Text] Klagenfurt -- The Freedom Party of Austria's [FPOe] 
New Year's Meeting, held in Klagenfurt on Sunday [9 January], 
was all about the provincial government elections in Carinthia, 
Tirol, and Salzburg on 13 March. In a two-and-a-half-hour talk, 
Joerg Haider swore into the "Third Republic" and "our kind of 
freedom" over 5,000 party members from all over Austria. 
  Following a short introduction by Klagenfurt's Deputy Mayor 
Reinhart Gaugg, Haider made the situation clear to the euphoric 
audience within the first five minutes: "The time of cheerful 
election campaigns is over, this is a time of historic 
decisions." 
  Apart from discussing Austria's role in Europe, "the awkward 
mental position that our country is in has to be stopped." A 
crossroads has been reached: "Either we develop into a society 
where everybody has to be a member of either of two parties, 
where everybody, starting from school headmaster to lipizzaner 
has to have a party membership card, or we go toward a Third 
Republic, toward democracy, where the citizens have the say, and 
not the parties." 
  The Austrian People's Party [OeVP] -- "it is giving up and 
it 
even likes it" -- is conceded a key role by Haider, though: "It 
must have the power to say we are no longer prepared to continue 
in the present way into a socialist future." 
  He said that he, himself, had a slight attack of political 
weakness; but with the help of his "faithful family, good 
friends, and strong assistants" he has again found pleasure in 
his job: "I will not be forced down by their hatred, I will not 
keep quiet when confronted with their lies, I will not tolerate 
the fact that the opinion of the people is increasingly being 
ignored -- this is my challenge." 
  This challenge also means Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, the 
head of the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe]: The 
coming years will be characterized by a "major confrontation" 
between Vranitzky and himself, Haider. "The glitter of a yuppy 
society is not one of our visions," Haider said. 
  Haider also emphasized the "enormous difference" between 
nationalism and national socialism, and almost warningly he 
said: "There is absolutely no point in trying to flirt with the 
brown [Nazi] left-overs." Haider went on: "We have to clean up 
this country politically." In 1998, at the latest, the "blue 
[FPOe] flag of freedom will be flying from the red-and-black 
[SPOe-OeVP] strongholds." 
  He was also quite generous in criticizing the investigations 
into the letter-bomb attacks: The special unit established by 
Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak is on a "dead track." Haider 
accused the government of conducting the investigations in a 
manner "hostile to the state," because it creates the impression 
abroad that Austria is a country of neo-Nazis.

<F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F>
reporter] 
  [Text] The prime minister today refused to extend Britain's 
commitment of troops to help with humanitarian aid in Bosnia 
until their security could be guaranteed. 
  Mr. Major was pressed by Labour Leader John Smith in the 
Commons over speculation that British troops may be pulled out 
at the end of the winter. 
  Mr. Smith urged Mr. Major, who was reporting on the outcome 
of the NATO summit, to put an end to such suggestions. 
  To some Tory jeers, Mr. Smith said: "Don't we need a 
commitment to increase ground forces as requested by the UN to 
make a greater effort to bring some peace to Bosnia?" 
  But Mr. Major replied: "We have committed ourselves to 
assist 
with humanitarian aid. I have to say that is not a commitment I 
am at this stage prepared to extend until I am certain of the 
security of the British troops working for the UN there. 
Despite remarkable work they have done for humanitarian 
reasons, our first concern must be the security of UN troops and 
in particular those of our own country." 
  Mr. Major hailed the summit as having reaffirmed America's 
commitment to Europe and shown the allies "standing closely 
together in maintaining their collective security." 
  Insisting that the priority was to ensure there were no new 
dividing lines in Europe, he said the summit had launched a 
vital new initiative towards the East, opening the way for new 
relationships and new NATO members. 
  "I believe that the summit has successfully equipped the 
alliance to meet new challenges." 
  He said of the threat to use air strikes to relieve 
peacekeepers in Srebrenica and reopen Tuzla airport: "We would 
prefer not to have to use force. But those who are impeding 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] at Srebrenica and Tuzla must 
realise that force is available if necessary to support UNPROFOR 
and its ability to protect relief efforts." 
  Mr. Smith said he broadly welcomed the summit declaration 
but 
asked if the threat of air strikes now was any different or 
stronger than the apparent commitment made last August, which 
had not resulted in any effective action. 
  "Repeated declarations which are not followed through, risk 
undermining the credibility of both NATO and the whole UN 
operation and only strengthen the hands of those who have become 
adept at defying the wishes of the international community," he 
warned. 
  Mr. Smith called for effective action in Tuzla and 
Srebrenica 
and to lift the siege of Sarajevo. 
  He said it was "wholly intolerable that a defenceless 
population in Sarajevo should be shelled so relentlessly and 
pitilessly." 
  Mr. Major said practical decisions on air strikes were best 
made not by politicians but by commanders near at hand. 
  "It is predominantly on their advice that I think it would 
be 
right for NATO leaders to act. There are reservations expressed 
from troop commanders from time to time and I think we would be 
very unwise to sweep those to one side." 
  Agreement in principle for military strikes was certainly 
there in these two specific cases, he said. But "casual edicts" 
should not be issued from afar. 
  Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith (Conservative Wealden) asked for 
an assurance that contingency plans were in place to prevent 
British and other UN troops being "sucked in" to the conflict if 
air strikes were authorised. 
  Mr. Major said he could not go into details, "but the 
security of our troops in such a circumstance would be given the 
very highest priority of all." 
  Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said Mr. Major had 
been 
warned many times that the "bottom-line credibility" of the UN 
operation in Bosnia was at risk and the opening of Tuzla airport 
was central to that credibility. 
  "As President Clinton said, `If we cannot show the 
determination to deliver our promises, then don't make 
promises.'" 
  Mr. Major retorted: "We have been very careful about the 
promises we could make -- unlike you, whose shifting and 
manoeuvring throughout this whole operation have included 
everything from all-out war to apparently pulling out 
immediately. Your opinions seem to have been moving on an 
escalator at rapid speed." 
  Peter Viggers (Conservative Gosport) said the delivery of 
humanitarian aid depended on cooperation of Serb, Croat and 
Muslim control posts. 
  He asked: "How can we be sure that this local cooperation 
will continue if we should have previously taken military action 
against one of the sides?" 
  Mr. Major replied: "You point precisely to one of the 
primary 
factors that needs to be taken into account before determining 
whether any military action of any sort needs to be taken." 
  He added: "It is very easy to say that it is an easy 
decision 
and that all you have to do is unleash an aircraft or two and 
all is well. I have to say to those who readily advocate that 
course, without careful thought, thought that it may well not be 
a wise policy. It may be a necessary policy at some stage -- 
but it is a policy that should be entered into with very 
considerable caution." 
  Tory Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South) said it was 
essential the Serbs understood NATO "meant business" so that the 
conflict did not grow. 
  Mr. Major agreed but said the conflict was no longer a 
clear-cut case of one aggressor and one victim. 
  The war was now a "horrible dispute in which each of the 
participants have committed actions which they should be 
thoroughly ashamed of." 
  Labour's Bob Cryer (Bradford South) demanded: "What's the 
point of spending time and a great deal of money looking around 
for something for NATO to do, simply in order to keep the 
organisation in existence when it really has no function left?" 
  To Tory protests, Mr. Cryer added: "NATO is redundant and we 
would be a lot better off without it." 
  Mr. Major told him: "NATO has been the guardian of our 
security for over 40 years. It would be folly beyond belief not 
to make sure that NATO is securely in place for the next 40 
years." 
  Tory Cyril Townsend (Bexleyheath) urged Mr. Major to say 
that 
the "special relationship" with the United States remained 
cordial. 
  Mr. Major stressed that he would have much to discuss with 
Mr. Clinton when they meet in Washington at the end of February. 
  They would discuss Russia, free trade, GATT, the Middle East 
peace process, Lockerbie, sanctions on Iraq -- "all matters on 
which the UK and the U.S. are in complete agreement and upon 
which the two governments have worked together." 
  He added: "The fact of the matter is the relationship 
between 
the UK and the U.S. is in very good repair."

  [Text] Come, I have a surprise for you, promised Alain 
Juppe when he invited journalists to the French Foreign Ministry 
this afternoon. There was in fact a surprise: the announcement 
by the foreign minister of the normalization of relations 
between France and the People's Republic of China [PRC]. Here 
is Alain Juppe's statement recorded by Luc Lemonnier: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] The political weight of China and 
its 
economic power today and tomorrow justifies France's decision to 
resume the ties of trust along the line of what General de 
Gaulle did in 1964. We have thus conducted talks that have 
borne their results today, and I am pleased. We have, on the 
other hand, explained to Taiwan that we would honor our 
commitments and that in the future we will exercise 
self-restraint in the supply of arms. Now I hope that all this 
will be implemented through the resumption of an intense 
political dialogue with Beijing and through the strengthening of 
economic relations. 
  I remind you that today, our share of the Chinese market is 
1.85 percent, while Germany's is five percent. The Chinese 
market is huge. The rate of China's development -- more than 13 
percent -- is the fastest in the world. Thus I think we have 
considerable possibilities that should be achieved now. [end

<F P=106> [Address by Hans-Ulrich Klose, Social Democratic Party of </F>
Germany [SPD] Bundestag Group chairman, to the Bundestag debate 
on NATO on 13 January -- live] 
  [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen! It is to be 
welcomed that immediately after the NATO summit in Brussels, the 
chancellor is informing parliament of its results and is giving 
us his assessment. This is the right way to deal with 
parliament, Mr. Chancellor, this is how it should be done. 
[applause] The fact that you, Mr. Chancellor, have given a 
positive assessment of the summit is no surprise. Perhaps it 
will come as a surprise to you that we, the opposition, 
contradict you, how shall I put it, in only muted terms, or even 
actually agree with you. [applause] We also regard the result, 
apart from individual questions and points of criticism, as 
generally positive. 
  This also applies, Ladies and Gentlemen, to the question of 
NATO's expansion, on which most interest as been focused. You 
know, Mr. Chancellor, that we Social Democrats back the 
expansion of NATO toward Central and East Europe, that we are in 
principle, in favor of it. In principle, this means that NATO 
expansion makes sense if it helps to develop a new European 
security structure that, and I stress this point, serves to 
stabilize the continent as a whole. We believe this can only 
happen if NATO: (a) retains its character as a collective system 
of defense and (b) helps by means of its existence and policies 
to create or support a collective European security system. 
  The point of this statement is to formulate an objective 
and, 
at the same time, a condition. We cannot support a security 
structure that offers Europe as a whole, not more but less 
security because it becomes the source of new tension. 
[applause] And for this reason an expansion of NATO is not 
possible at the moment. 
  I am well aware, Ladies and Gentlemen, that the countries 
that now wish to join, the Baltic states, Poland, the Visegrad 
states as a whole, take a different view. They see themselves 
in a specifically threatening situation that they would like to 
avert by speedy NATO accession. Whether this will prove 
successful is a matter for debate. However, I understand their 
position, and I also understand the fact that there is a degree 
of disappointment in the countries I have mentioned. Polish 
politicians and others have expressed this disappointment and I 
understand it. But it will be very wrong if in Poland or 
anywhere else, the impression emerged that the West did not want 
them, or was once again leaving them to their fate. [applause] 
This is not the case. For one thing, the decisions taken at 
the NATO summit retain the option for accession, or rather, they 
actually open up this option. For another, the approval of the 
Partnership for Peace represents an offer of cooperation that, 
depending on the practicalities, is a far-reaching one, 
particularly when viewed in the context of subsequent accession. 
And third, no one should have any interest in adding grist to 
the mill of those forces in Russia that are stirring fear of 
encirclement, in reality to prepare a new imperial role for 
Russia. [applause] 
  We know that such forces exist, Ladies and Gentlemen. They 
did not win the elections in Russia, but they are menacingly 
strong. Everything that we know about them, and what we hear 
from their representatives, worries us, [it worries] us and 
others whose concern is of course even greater than ours for 
sheer geographical reasons. We do not want to strengthen these 
forces in Russia, which is why the West in fact, is taking 
Russian concerns into account. But that does not mean, to put it 
quite clearly, that we concede to the Russian leadership, the 
Russian president, a kind of right of veto over NATO expansion. 
However, since we want the democratic reformers to be 
strengthened and to succeed, we should avoid anything that makes 
their position in their own country any more difficult. We are 
at one with the government on this. 
  I would add that in the current [Russian] Government and 
within the Russian military there are isolated voices that 
betray a hegemonical stance with a kind of Monroe doctrine, at 
least with regard to the countries of the former Soviet Union. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, anyone who behaves as if Zhirinovskiy has 
already taken power possibly helps to bring this about. 
[applause] 
  We welcome the invitation to a Partnership for Peace 
addressed to the members of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, and to other CSCE countries, as an offer of achieving 
expansion of NATO to the east through practical cooperation, in 
what is termed an evolutionary process. It would be desirable 
for cooperation with the invited countries to develop in such a 
way that, in the end, the eastward expansion of NATO will become 
superfluous, because a functioning collective security system 
had already developed. That is pie in the sky at the moment, I 
know, and you would have to be quite optimistic to think such a 
development probable, but nothing is possible without optimism. 
  At least we, the opposition in the German Bundestag, also 
ask 
our neighbors to the East to get involved in this cooperation. 
We Germans want this cooperation, because we have a vital 
interest of our own, in overcoming the situation in which we 
find ourselves of being a frontier country. From our point of 
view, it is desirable that our neighbors should be in the same 
system of cooperation and security that we have entered into. 
That this cooperation should not be restricted to military 
issues, Ladies and Gentlemen, should be especially stressed 
here. There will be no security in Europe if economic problems 
are not also solved, if we do not succeed in giving the people 
in East Europe the hope that economically things will improve. 
  The suitability for NATO, if I may put it that way, of an 
East European country does not depend, first and foremost, on 
whether the equipment of its Army is NATO-compatible. What is 
decisive is progress in efforts to improve people's 
opportunities in life. [applause] 
  Only if, Ladies and Gentlemen [applause], only if this 
proves successful can we create stability, without which there 
can be no lasting peace in Europe as a whole. Partnership for 
Peace must therefore, be accompanied by a partnership for 
development -- in economic, social, and democratic terms. 
Making this partnership reality and offering concrete aid is 
the proper way, and the only one that offers the promise of 
success. [applause] 
  Germany on its own has done much, and we are not criticizing 
this, on the contrary. However, Mr. Chancellor, I cannot see 
any integrated security and development policy ideas for East 
Europe. 
  The German Government has repeatedly described itself as the 
advocate of the countries of East Europe, I recall statements to 
this effect especially from you, Mr. Kinkel. And it is true 
that the government never tires of constantly assuring as many 
East European countries as possible that Germany will support 
them in every possible objective, above all, in their wish to 
join the European Community, or rather the European Union. 
  I believe the government means what it says, but we should 
not forget that Germany on its own cannot possibly deliver the 
support that is expected. I repeat, what is needed is an 
integrated concept for security and development that is 
supported and materially backed by all our Western partners, if 
possible by Japan as well. [applause] 
  Security, Ladies and Gentlemen, is not only, not even first 
and foremost, a military problem. Mr. Chancellor, you know this 
as well as I do. However, I cannot detect any willingness on 
your part to take the correct foreign policy decisions that 
follow from this. At any rate, I have heard nothing to this 
effect in your statement today. You could, Mr. Chancellor, say 
in your defense that this was not, and could not have been, the 
subject of the NATO summit. However, I take a different view. 
  Have we not always stressed, not least yourself, that NATO 
is 
more than an alliance with just a military purpose. Is NATO not 
also a forum for political debate and agreement, as well as a 
policy tool? We at any rate take this view, Mr. Chancellor, and 
for this reason we would have liked the alliance's heads of 
state gathered in Brussels to have taken a wider understanding 
of the concept of partnership than they in fact did. Once 
again, security is not just a military problem. But 
unfortunately, it is the case that in the unstable current 
situation, in view of the numerous conflicts and brutal wars, 
that military calculations have moved to the fore, in the face 
of the high hopes many people had after the fall of the Iron 
Curtain and the collapse of Communism. 
  We dreamt of a peaceful, free, economically flourishing 
Europe, of a Europe that could return to its roots in unity once 
again. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am still hopeful, but I admit 
that my hope is now mixed with concern, fear, and anger. The 
peoples of East Europe have returned to Europe from Communist 
imprisonment, it is true. But how have we, who so praised their 
role in the liberation of East Europe, how have we accepted them 
here? Europe is in fact still divided and will remain so for a 
long time unless there is a great joint effort. And there will 
be no secure peace in Europe so long as this practical division 
remains. [applause] 
  It is quite correct, that with the collapse of the Soviet 
empire, the danger of a great apocalyptic war has diminished. 
That Ukraine, which is after all numerically the third nuclear 
power in the world, finally seems prepared to dismantle its 
nuclear potential, further reduces the danger. Nevertheless, 
nasty and brutal conventional war has returned to Europe and we 
can apparently find no strength to act preventively, that is to 
prevent war. We have as yet no effective strategy for curbing 
or ending war. Yugoslavia is a frightening example. 
  I have read the statements at the NATO summit on Yugoslavia, 
on Bosnia. The Serbs and the other peoples who are killing each 
other in the former Yugoslavia believe, I am afraid, not a word 
of them. I am, Mr. Chancellor, in agreement with the 
organizational decision concerning the relationship between NATO 
and the WEU [Western European Union]. The recognition of the 
European Union as an equal partner with the United States on 
foreign and security policy issues, the definition of the WEU in 
the communique as the defense and security instrument of the 
European Union -- we can accept that. I am however, not in 
agreement because action here is once again more on the level of 
military organization, without any progress being discernible in 
the formulation of a joint foreign and security policy. 
[applause] 
  The WEU is to become capable of independent military action 
but without double military structures arising -- we accept 
that. But is there -- quite apart from the German nonclarities 
-- clarity about what is to be achieved with this military 
operational capacity of the WEU? You know that I think that 
military precautions, including a realistic component of 
deterrence, which in my view helps to prevent war, are right and 
necessary. But, that once again the military aspect is to be 
organized first without previously gaining clarity about 
political strategies, worries me more and more. And it makes me 
suspicious not least because you, Mr. Chancellor, have not 
spoken here today about this group of decisions by the summit. 
I definitely want the joint European defense and security 
identity, with the Bundeswehr as an alliance army. But I am 
opposed to even giving the impression that Europe is striving 
for the role of an intervention force acting on its own 
prerogative. [applause] 
  That NATO or the WEU could and should take on roles within 
the framework of the United Nations or the CSCE is controversial 
here only to the extent that we are talking about the range and 
nature of such tasks. You know the different positions. We all 
of us [in the SPD] object if it is a matter of laying claim to 
an independent military role for the WEU, the European Union, 
beyond defense and outside the alliance area. We have already 
done that in the case of NATO, and we do it even more decisively 
in the case of the WEU, thus without the United States and 
Canada. 
  Allow me, Ladies and Gentlemen, an aside here. I find it 
astonishing that the government insists on expanding the radius 
of action of the Bundeswehr, and that it insists on this so 
strongly. That extends right to the suggestion by Mr. Schaeuble 
that the Bundeswehr should be deployed more within Germany. 
This is a suggestion that I find, if I may say so, a 
politically absurd idea. [applause] 
  At the same time, Ladies and Gentlemen, they are carrying 
out an endless debate on the numerate strength of the 
Bundeswehr. Are you not at all aware that the fitness of action 
of the Bundeswehr, that has just undergone the greatest 
restructuring in its history, will be seriously endangered by 
that. You yourself, Mr. Chancellor, began this debate at the 
defense conference in Munich -- please note I have nothing at 
all against the strength of the Bundeswehr being discussed -- 
but I beg you not to come up with new figures every two to three 
months and not just to consider this with regard to budgetary 
considerations. The security position and the task of the 
Bundeswehr must also be included somewhere [in this debate]. 
Only then can this be called a rational debate. [applause] 
  In any case, I find it a total contradiction that the tasks 
of the Bundeswehr are now being expanded by means of the WEU 
plans, but that its possibilities in real terms are to be 
constantly reduced. This is not how a responsible defense and 
security policy functions. That, Mr. Chancellor, is a stop-go 
policy. [applause] 
  One final observation. We were, Mr. Chancellor, not very 
happy with the result of the summit meeting of the heads of 
state and governments of the European Union in Brussels in 
December. We had wanted to see greater determination to fight 
mass unemployment in the European Union. The unemployment 
figure of 18 million in the European Union makes this an urgent 
priority. The Federal Government acted particularly 
obstructively here. The proposals of the [European] Commission 
to finance job-creating infrastructure measures were shelved, as 
were the proposals to reduce incidental salary costs, to reduce 
the burden on labor, and to compensate for this by means of an 
energy tax. We regret this and we will use this opportunity 
here in parliament today to say this, there was no earlier 
opportunity. Although we are discontented with your European 
achievements in a specific case, I will confirm that we take 
your European involvement: (a) seriously and (b) do not believe 
it is illusionary. [applause] 
  We Germans need Europe, because, for one thing, Europe -- in 
addition to NATO -- has fundamentally contributed to the fact 
that we have lived in peace in West Europe for 48 years. This 
cannot -- you also said that today -- be taken for granted but 
is a result of political creative power over many, many years. 
It is important to particularly point this out again today 
because it is more fashionable in your ranks, Mr. Chancellor, 
than in ours, to not only criticize European development but to 
even question it. We also have some criticism to make, we are 
certainly not in agreement with everything that is done or not 
done by the Commission in Brussels or by the Council of 
Ministers. However, we will adhere to our commitment to Europe. 
We do not believe convinced Europeans are illusionists: They 
can produce solid instead of emotional arguments to show their 
commitment, both peace and economic arguments. The people we 
think are illusionists, even gamblers, are those who set the 
national state against Europe and thus, for whatever reasons, 
want to take Europe back to the 19th century. [applause] 
  We are also patriots. We love our country. But we are and 
remain, convinced Europeans. And we will not stop dreaming of 
the dream of the United States of Europe and working on bringing 
it about. [applause]

  [Text] The debate on the motion of no confidence in the 
government proposed by [Radical leader Marco] Pannella has begun 
with a speech by Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. 
  Ciampi said it was not up to government to decide whether to 
dissolve parliament, and invited President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, 
whom he will consult after the debate, to express his opinion 
about the situation, making it clear that he would place his 
mandate at Scalfaro's disposal. Ciampi pointed out the 
different positions of the political forces concerning the 
legislature's prospects: according to some they have been 
exhausted, while others say that important and specific acts 
still have to be carried out.

  [Excerpts] The NATO summit and the Lajes base were broached 
by Foreign Minister Durao Barroso today. This morning the 
minister met the defense committee in parliament to say that 
Portugal's objectives for the NATO summit had been achieved and 
that the Lajes base [Azores] negotiations are on the right 
track. Lacalete Marques reports. 
  [Lacalete] Barroso briefed the defense committee on the 
results of the NATO summit. The opposition also wanted to know 
the state of the Lajes negotiations. The minister spoke of 
cooperation and the wish to move away from the idea of financial 
quid pro quos, obtaining other types of support for Portugal. 
  [Begin Barroso recording] The idea we wish to move away from 
is the idea of quid pro quos: The idea that we give the base 
and in return we receive a particular financial or other quid 
pro quo. No, the concept we want -- moreover because it is more 
in line with the dignity of a country such as Portugal, an 
active NATO and WEU [Western European Union] member -- is one of 
collaboration or cooperation toward a common objective that is 
Atlantic security, Western security. [end recording] 
  [Lacalete] [passage omitted] As for the NATO summit, Barroso 
said that Lisbon's negotiating objectives were met and he 
explained what the Partnership for Peace accord meant for 
Portugal. 
  [Begin Barroso recording] Partnership for Peace as an 
answer, 
I believe, is good, skillful, pragmatic, flexible, to the 
problem of knowing how to, on the one hand, respond to the 
security fears of the Central and East European countries, 
without, on the other hand, creating a new border in Europe with 
enemies further afield, namely Russia. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has said current 
intensive attempts on the part of the Greek Cypriot 
administration towards armament are incompatible with the 
principles of goodwill at a time when the confidence building 
measures have been included on the agenda and efforts are being 
exerted to resume the intercommunal talks. 
  In a written statement on Greek Cypriot armament efforts, 
Atun said that some 5 trillion Turkish lira has been allocated 
to arms purchases in the Greek Cypriot defense budget for 1994. 
He added that the arms purchases, which have been intensified 
within the framework of the military doctrine signed with 
Greece, once again show that Kliridhis' disarmament proposal is 
not serious. Atun said that it is beneficial to know that 
trust cannot be built between the two peoples while policies of 
armament and enmity continue, adding that the countries that are 
selling arms to the Greek Cypriot community cannot contribute to 
the peace process. He noted that Greece and other European 
Union member countries, by arming the Greek Cypriot 
administration, clearly demonstrate why the role the EU wants to 
play in the Cyprus problem is unacceptable. 
  Drawing the attention of the UN secretary general and the 
Security Council members to the armament activities that have 
intensified following the signing of the Greek-Greek Cypriot 
military doctrine, Atun called on the United Nations to put an 
end to adventurist moves that will disrupt the atmosphere of 
peace reigning on the island and that will create new tensions.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that NATO 
member countries, through the communique issued at the end of 
the Brussels summit, have not only confirmed their cooperation 
on the issues of democracy and human rights but on the struggle 
against terror as well. She added that this outcome was 
achieved through the competent defense of a just cause. 
  Ciller concluded her visit to Brussels and has returned to 
Ankara. Prior to her return, Ciller visited a Turkish quarter 
in Brussels. [passage omitted] 
  At Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Ciller was received by various 
ministers, deputies, and many citizens. Speaking at a news 
conference at the airport, Ciller gave information on the issues 
taken up at the summit and on her contacts. She noted that the 
stand to be adopted and strategy pursued by NATO regarding the 
restructuring of Europe were discussed in Brussels. Pointing 
out that within this framework the concept of a partnership for 
peace was adopted, Ciller said: A strategy that extends its 
defense wing to countries that were once Warsaw Pact members but 
that currently want to be part of Europe has been adopted. 
Ciller continued: 
  [Begin recording] Now a door has been opened to former 
Warsaw Pact members. This door is the NATO membership door. 
One should not, however, interpret this as though the former 
Warsaw Pact members have been accepted into NATO. According to 
this concept this door has been opened to all of Eastern Europe 
and the eastern bloc, including Russia, without disrupting the 
principle of equality but at the same time taking into 
consideration the differences among these countries and their 
respective peace plans. This process has also been extended 
over a certain period. [end recording] 
  Ciller stated that an agreement has been reached on the 
defense of the countries within the eastern bloc and on their 
joining the alliance within a certain period of time. She added 
that in time a program and a plan will emerge on the issue. 
Ciller stated that while this was agreed upon, a strategy that 
will prevent placing Russia against NATO was also put forward. 
She said: 
  [Begin recording] We have, once again, found the opportunity 
to defend the view that, given the changing world conditions 
both from east to west and north to south, Turkey is no longer 
only a flank country but also a central one. Within this 
framework, I am glad to state that significant steps have been 
taken in the struggle to get NATO to adopt Western values as 
well as the values of other worlds. [end recording] 
  Ciller stressed that member countries confirming at the 
summit that they will cooperate on the struggle against terror 
is a significant step for Turkey. 
  She said the following on the issue: 
  [Begin recording] We can now say that this organization, a 
member of which we have been for the last 42 years, has decided 
to back up the struggle against terror in the world. This has 
been achieved through the competent defense of a just cause. 
This was not all we managed to achieve. A series of agreements 
and views concerning Azerbaijan and the unjust developments in 
that country were included in the communique. 
  A struggle was also waged for the just cause of our Muslim 
brethren in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A step further than the 
original text of the communique was attained. The opening of 
Tuzla, the rescue of Sarajevo, and the promise that efforts will 
be exerted to distribute humanitarian aid were also included in 
the communique. [end recording] 
  She noted that despite all this world public opinion did not 
use the explicit expressions Turkey desired, adding that the 
political determination on the issue should be further 
consolidated. Stressing that Turkey views this as another stage 
in the human rights struggle, Ciller referred to the need for 
more cooperation with world countries in a bid to achieve more 
concrete work on the issue. She said that at the summit she 
observed that Europe is waging a struggle for self-identity, 
adding that a plan that introduces the flexibility of acting 
outside NATO, without being independent from the alliance, has 
been adopted. She noted that from now on the Western European 
Union will have the opportunity to benefit from NATO forces with 
the approval of the alliance. Pointing out that the other 
friendly countries agreed that Turkey's status within NATO 
should be raised, Ciller described this as an auspicious 
development. 
  Ciller said that during her contacts the issue of the 
European Union was also discussed. She added that the member 
countries agreed that joint new steps should be taken with the 
EU and that a financial protocol should be realized within the 
framework of the Customs Union. Pointing out that the execution 
phase will begin in the next few months, Ciller recalled that 
Turkey will be part of the Customs Union in 1995. Stressing 
that Turkey is a key country in the region, Ciller concluded as 
follows: 
  [Begin recording] The developments in Europe and the world 
and the disintegration of the Soviet Union have not decreased 
Turkey's importance. On the contrary the developments on the 
east-west and north-south axes have made Turkey a key country. 
We share the same problems. As a country that has made an 
equal contribution to the solution of these shared problems -- 
and not as a country that follows suit -- I hope that this 
summit will contribute to peace in Turkey and the world. [end 
recording] 
  Ciller later, cheered by the public, left Esenboga Airport 
for the city.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with former neo-Nazi Ingo Hasselbach by </F>
Alexandra Foederl-Schmid in Berlin; date not given: "`Anyone Can 
Build a Bomb'"] 
  [Excerpt] Berlin -- Since last year he has been in refuge 
from his former friends: Ingo Hasselbach, who used to be a 
leading figure among German neo-Nazis, has "quit." The man from 
East Berlin was the head of a neo-Nazi squatting action at 
Berlin's Weitlingstrasse 122, and he was also briefly the head 
of Berlin's National Alternative, a local organization belonging 
to the NSDAP-AO [National Socialist German Workers 
Party--Foreign Organization] operating from the United States. 
  Twenty-six-year old Hasselbach now lives abroad. Two months 
ago, he was sent a letter bomb, camouflaged as a shipment of 
books, at his mother's address. It contained TNT, which did not 
explode because a battery had run out. According to police 
explosives experts, the bomb could have destroyed three floors 
of the house. 
  Talking to DER STANDARD during a short visit to Germany, 
Hasselbach draws parallels between the attack on him and the 
series of letter-bomb attacks in Austria. "There is a common 
style to them all," he said. 
  It comes as no surprise to him that "something would happen 
after Gottfried Kuessel's conviction [for neo-Nazi activities]." 
While Kuessel, the leader of Austria's neo-Nazis, was in prison 
already, Hasselbach was still "fully involved in the scene, and 
they were talking about actions at that time." [passage omitted] 
  According to Hasselbach, all active members of the 
right-wing 
scene are trained in handling explosives. He thinks the five 
men arrested in connection with the Austrian letter-bomb attacks 
-- of whom he knows Peter Binder, Hans Georg Ley, and Gerd 
Endres personally -- have the necessary knowledge to build a 
letter bomb: "Building such a bomb, following instructions, is 
quite easy. There are instruction booklets available. It is 
easy to buy the ingredients, especially for these nitroglycerine 
bombs." Building instructions are available from Gerry Lauck's 
NSDAP-AO, which operates out of Nebraska, in the United States. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Haider at Squad Meeting </H5>
  Hasselbach was a regular guest of Gottfried Kuessel's in 
Vienna. He attended training sessions and squad meetings there. 
His book Die Abrechnung [Settling of Accounts] says 
that "a well-known politician" appeared at one of these meetings 
in April 1990. Talking to DER STANDARD, Hasselbach was more 
precise: "It was Joerg Haider." He also said there were 
"regular contacts" between Kuessel, Walter Ochensberger, and 
Haider. "I even had his private phone number at one point. 
Haider was particularly enthusiastic about the young people 
coming over from the GDR." At a meeting in 1991, Haider 
attended only briefly, but he specifically shook hands with the 
people from Berlin. 
  Hasselbach considers the group around Kuessel to be "one of 
the toughest in Europe." They are training new recruits 
professionally, he said. [passage omitted].

  [Text] Gustav Hochenbichler, head of the Police Bureau for 
Foreigners and one of the highest State Police officials, is 
suspected of having spied for the former East Bloc. His home 
was searched today. No arrest warrant has been issued. No 
further details are known. The Justice Ministry has confirmed a 
relevant report in the 14 January edition of NEUE 
KRONEN-ZEITUNG, and said a news blackout has been imposed so as 
not to jeopardize investigations.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 13 (AFP) -- Belgian Deputy Prime 
Minister Guy Coeme denied Thursday [13 January] that he had been 
involved in a major corruption scandal concerning a helicopter 
contract, and said he had no intention of resigning. 
  Coeme, who is facing moves to lift his parliamentary 
immunity, also told a press conference that he knew nothing 
about the unsolved 1991 murder of former Belgian minister and 
Socialist Party boss Andre Cools. 
  Persistent press reports said that Cools might have been 
slain because he knew too much about kickbacks allegedly offered 
to Coeme's Socialist Party by the Italian firm Agusta, which won 
a contract for 46 helicopters in 1988. 
  A judicial report on the affair, leaked last week, said 
Agusta had won the 225 million dollar contract by offering a 
413,000 dollar bribe to Coeme's Francophone Socialist Party, 
part of Belgium's fragile ruling coalition. 
  A special parliamentary commission was due to rule later 
Thursday on the request from an investigating magistrate that 
Coeme's parliamentary immunity be lifted so that he can be 
questioned about the scandal. 
  Coeme, a socialist who is also transport minister but was 
defence minister when the helicopter contract was signed, said: 
"I committed no forgery. There were no written forgeries. 
There were no unfair acts." 
  He rejected demands from political foes that he resign, 
saying that this would amount to admitting guilt. Coeme added 
that "I have a feeling of profound injustice" and that he would 
welcome any chance to clear his name. 
  He said he had submitted to a parliamentary probe a detailed 
account of how the helicopter contract had been was awarded to 
Agusta which showed there had been no irregularities or 
manipulation. 
  Coeme maintained that there had been "insane competition" at 
the time by lobbyists "circling the case like vultures." 
  The judicial report alleges that Coeme had suppressed 
recommendations in favour of the German firm Messerschmidt 
Boelkow Bloehm (MBB) and the French aircraft manufacturer 
Aerospatiale. 
  The deputy prime minister denied any knowledge of a draft 
recommendation from Belgium's military purchasing office that a 
tender from MBB be excluded from consideration. 
  The Belgian parliament was to vote Friday on whether to lift 
the parliamentary immunity of another two Francophone socialists 
implicated in the scandal. 
  They are Guy Spitaels, currently head of the regional 
Francophone Walloon regional government who was Francophone 
Socialist Party boss in 1988, and Guy Mathot, a member of the 
Walloon regional government.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Claes Continues To Claim </F>
Professional Error by Ambassador in Khan Affair"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Foreign Minister Willy Claes still 
maintains that Ambassador Staes committed a professional error 
in Pakistan regarding the Khan affair. The ambassador in 
Islamabad [Staes] failed to inform the Ministry about the 
official issuing of a visa, Claes told the parliamentary foreign 
affairs committee on Wednesday [12 January]. Do not 
underestimate the consequences of the affair, said Claes, also 
regarding my own safety. 
  Claes was questioned once again by Agalev [Flemish Ecology 
Party] Senator Magda Aelvoet about the issuing of a visa to 
Amanullah Khan, president of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation 
Front (JKLF). 
  Khan was arrested with that visa in his pocket when he came 
to Brussels on 18 October, at the invitation of the Socialist 
Group of the European Parliament. Following a negative response 
by the call for his extradition to India, he was put on a plane 
back to Pakistan toward the end of December. 
  Claes said Staes had confirmed on 20 October that the visa 
had officially been issued without consulting the central list 
of wanted persons (CBS), and that he (Staes) himself had 
approved the issuing of visas to the Khan party. In order to 
prove this, Claes showed the cable Staes sent him on the 
above-mentioned date. He refuted allegations of having quoted 
only selected passages from the cable from Staes in answer to 
questions in the parliamentary committees on 3 November. 
  An internal inquiry is still under way.

<F P=106> [Speech by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in the Bundestag in </F>
Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Dear colleagues, the NATO summit was a success and 
it is pleasing to know that this has been acknowledged by the 
whole Bundestag, including the opposition. 
  As the defense minister, I wish to say I was very happy with 
the debate and the fact that all speakers, colleagues from the 
government, colleagues from the parliamentary groups of the 
governing parties, and Klose as the chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] parliamentary group, have acknowledged 
the importance of the Bundeswehr -- positive, strong and good 
words about the Bundeswehr. This encourages me; not that we 
will receive large amounts of funding -- I am not asking for 
that -- but sufficient funds to implement those things that have 
received general support here. There is still some work to be 
done in this respect. 
  The NATO summit...[pauses] I really think this is good; it 
is 
good for the Bundeswehr and, incidentally, it is in line with 
the international security policy situation. What has been said 
here is correct, in that all of us together must find the 
strength to implement this, because with words alone I cannot 
finance a single soldier and I cannot train a single Bundeswehr 
unit. 
  The summit was a success because it supplied answers to the 
three decisive tasks we are facing. 
  First, NATO makes no concessions regarding its ability of 
collective defense. This is also urgently necessary because the 
security situation in Europe is far from stable. Besides 
defense of the alliance, NATO also sees the ability to 
participate in international crisis management as its new core 
task, which it will resolutely develop further. It is good and 
correct that the alliance has decided to adapt its armed forces 
and command structures in order to enable them to fulfil the new 
tasks. And, Hans-Ulrich Klose, Germany must fully participate 
in NATO's old and the new tasks in case it jeopardizes NATO's 
ability to act. This is decisive for the debate here in Germany. 
  Second, reform of NATO and European integration are brought 
in line with each other. The United States has made its peace 
with the equal partnership of a united Europe within the 
alliance. For this, Europe must become strategically able to 
act. This would ease the burden for America and create the 
preconditions for a permanent American commitment in and to 
Europe as affirmed impressively by the American President. This 
is especially remarkable when one remembers the past controversy 
over the Eurocorps. There was also a heated debate about this 
in Germany. 
  There is a great degree of harmony within the alliance 
concerning its significance as part of NATO and the Western 
European Union [WEU]. The WEU is being strengthened as the 
European pillar of the alliance. It will in future be able to 
rely on the structures and strengths of NATO. However, the 
alliance will remain the decisive consultative forum on security 
issues in Europe. In the end, it is NATO that decides whether 
it is the alliance or the WEU which acts. That is the political 
price for the WEU being able to use NATO's capacity, that Europe 
is able to act in terms of security and defense policy and that 
we avoid the creation of dual structures. 
  Despite my gratification at the SPD support for the policy 
of 
eastward expansion, I have to say that when we discuss the WEU 
and the creation of a European security and defense identity, 
Mr. Klose, the SPD's position remains self-contradictory. You 
say the WEU represents a militarization of Europe. There is no 
question that the WEU will always act on the basis of the UN 
Charter, but it is a fact that Europe will be able to act 
militarily only if Germany is fully involved in these tasks, and 
this is a question which addresses the responsibility of the 
Social Democrats. No one can take responsibility for Germany by 
continuing with its previous position, making the WEU, and thus 
Europe itself, unable to act. 
  Third, NATO has made the stabilization of eastern Europe a 
joint objective of the highest priority. To this end we need a 
convincing overall plan of integration and deeper cooperation. 
I think this enables us to meet the justified expectations of 
our neighbors. At the same time, we have to develop a 
partnership of a special quality with Ukraine, and above all 
with Russia. 
  Partnership for Peace is an important and useful step toward 
bringing new partners nearer to Western security institutions. 
It is not a substitute for opening up the alliance, and what 
was said in Brussels was only achieved after months of effort. 
It was not planned that way at the outset; in fact, to begin 
with it was seen as being more of a substitute for membership, 
and I think we should be happy that this is now the alliance's 
policy. Just as the chancellor said during his speech to the 
NATO Council, we are offering all of these countries a 
Partnership for Peace and at the same time are opening up the 
prospect of joining NATO. This is a basis on which we can act. 
[applause]. 
  I supported this plan for months; I am glad that we 
achieved this result, and German policy as a whole made a very 
good contribution to this, as did what came from the 
parliamentary groups, from almost all the parliamentary groups 
in this House. I am firmly convinced that only in this way will 
the alliance remain viable, and only in this way can we fulfill 
the task of establishing security in and for Europe. Stability 
for peace is no empty formula; that is a great mistake -- rather 
it is a practical, urgent program, and before the end of this 
year. There will be no discrimination; everyone can 
participate, but of course we will differentiate -- we will 
begin concrete cooperation, concrete measures. These include 
joint training and exercises, joint planning for peace missions 
and specific support in the planning of military structures that 
make NATO membership possible in the first place. 
  I think that so far we have done a great deal. We have 
concluded with all of our eastern neighbors some military 
cooperation agreements that we have fleshed out and that we must 
further fulfill, with the aim of bringing our eastern neighbors 
closer to western security institutions. The opening of the 
alliance to our immediate neighbors in the East is in our vital 
interest. I have always taken the view that one doesn't have to 
be a strategic genius to grasp that. I have occasionally been 
surprised how little we worked from a clear analysis of German 
interests. The frontier of stability and security: unstable to 
the East of our border, stable on this side. Prosperity on this 
side, poverty on the other -- that cannot turn out well in the 
long run, and so Germany's eastern frontier should not remain 
for long the furthest frontier of NATO and the European Union 
[EU]. Either we export stability or we will import instability, 
and nobody formulated it earlier or better than Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher, who said things will not go well for us in the long 
run if they go badly for our eastern neighbors in the long run. 
[applause] 
  For this reason German interests at least are crystal clear, 
and since we cannot achieve them alone, we must create something 
like a European solidarity pact. That means that the funds 
which hitherto have flowed from North to South must now go more 
from West to East. And there is quite a lot of egoism, also 
among the southern democracies, whom we helped immediately in 
the stabilization of their democracries. The south of Europe is 
also the West, and in comparison with the East they are rich. 
For this reason German policy must push this process forward. 
This is not a provocation aimed at anyone. There has been an 
artificial division of Europe here, and if NATO opens, if the EU 
opens, then the Europe which belonged together for centuries 
will grow together again. That is no provocation at all. 
  I wish that some people would accept certain contributions 
to 
the debate less defensively and not try to give us a bad 
conscience. The area of stability in Europe is spreading and 
does not constitute a provocation toward anyone. In addition it 
is clear that future EU members can be no less secure than the 
present members, such as ourselves, who already belong to NATO. 
  It is therefore clear that German interests, vital German 
interests, coincide with the expectations and legitimate 
security interests of our neighbors, the Poles, Hungarians, 
Czechs, Slovaks and others, who want nothing less than to belong 
to the family of European democracies once again. If there is 
one thing that has bothered me during the debate, which has 
lasted over a year now, then it has been the contributions of 
those who occasionally said with the coldness of iceskating 
judges: Let's watch these new democracies for a few more years 
to see if they really qualify for membership, to see whether 
democracy is really stable enough, the odd election didn't go 
too well. I don't know if they always go so well here -- and: 
We don't know what economic developments will be in Poland. I 
have to tell you that this is an unbelievable attitude, and we 
ought to remember our own German postwar history. 
  I am firmly convinced that the stabilization of democracy in 
postwar Germany, the stabilization of our economy, can be put 
down to ourselves only by half at the most; the rest was based 
on our early membership of the western alliances, the EU and 
NATO. And for this reason we Germans should never 
forget...[indistinct interruption] Yes, of course, the Marshall 
Plan, that as well, of course, and for this reason Germany as 
well as others have to contribute to a European solidarity pact, 
and I repeat that those who comment with the coldness of 
iceskating judges and observe how well democracy is developing 
in Poland or Hungary and how painstakingly the market economy is 
being implemented there -- without the adjective as far as 
possible -- and then say: Let's see if they qualify for the 
alliance and the EU -- these people are committing an historic 
mistake and it is one we cannot afford to make. [applause] 
  There is wide-ranging support among the German public for 
this policy. Germans feel and know that we cannot under any 
circumstances pursue a policy which would have to make a choice 
between Warsaw and Moscow. Some things that have been said in 
the debate have occasionally bothered me. We would have made a 
huge mistake if we had allowed such an alternative to be imposed 
upon us; there is no need for this, it would do no good, neither 
the need for close, friendly relations between Germany and 
Russia, nor our desire to develop a relationship with our 
eastern neighbors which is every bit as close as that with our 
western neighbors. 
  Stability in Europe, as we all know, and this has clearly 
emerged during the debate, can only be achieved with and not 
against Russia, but the space between Germany and Russia should 
not be forgotten. I think the key elements -- integration and 
cooperation -- are now in the right balance. This is an 
irreversible process which the NATO summit has set in train, and 
NATO has therefore assumed a leading role in the stability of 
the whole of Europe. 
  Germany must be in a position, as I have just said, to 
participate in fulfilling all NATO's old and new tasks 
appropriately. Our partners in the East and West have great 
expectations for a responsible German policy, which acts 
resolutely and prudently. The security situation -- and I think 
we all agreed on this, government and opposition -- at the start 
of the New Year is confused. 
  It was necessary and correct for NATO to affirm its 
willingness to make sure that humanitarian aid reaches Sarajevo 
and the other threatened areas, if necessary using military 
force. Bosnia shows that we are far from having reached the 
level of stability that the new Europe needs for its emergence. 
  Some only realized, because of someone like Zhirinovskiy, 
that the political revolution in Europe is not yet complete. It 
was at its peak in 1989, but it has not yet come to its end. If 
one compares it to an earthquake there is no question at all, 
the lava has neither cooled nor has it stopped flowing. There 
are not only radical forces who are, for instance, questioning 
the independence of Ukraine. Therefore it is important that we 
handle this still difficult security situation in Europe, which 
has not yet become a completed chapter of history, with extreme 
care. 
  Germany, as the core country of the EU, bears special 
responsibility in this respect. We must give the right signals, 
we must contribute to enabling Europe to act militarily. I 
think that some people underestimate this, those who see the 
Bundeswehr, above all, with regard to Germany. We have to see 
it at least as our contribution to European defense. Without an 
appropriate German contribution we jeopardize European defense 
as a whole. 
  It is conceivable that Europe will find itself in a 
situation 
where it has to manage crises and conflicts by itself. This is 
no longer the postwar period when we could pass everything on to 
be shouldered by the Americans. This became clear at the 
summit. This is a chance to develop our own identity, and to 
take on a much greater responsibility, and we must make 
appropriate arrangements for this. Without a substantial German 
contribution there will be no common European security and 
defense policy. 
  Our responsibility regarding security policy decisions goes 
far beyond the 80 million Germans. Therefore what we do is 
being carefully watched. In this situation the quality and 
quantity of Germany's security precautions must not be made 
dependent on financial considerations alone. This has become 
evident here too. I have put it as follows: No one would cancel 
their fire insurance because there has not been a fire for a 
long time. This prudence of the ordinary people who look after 
their home should be applied by us also with regard to our home, 
Germany, and the European home. 
  The Bundeswehr largely determines our ability to be part of 
an alliance. It is an important factor of European stability, 
and this must remain so. 
  Thank you very much.

  [Text] In the Bundestag yesterday the NATO summit in 
Brussels was praised on all sides (?because of its calls) for 
increased help to East Europe and further measures, as well as 
accepting other countries into NATO and the European Union. I 
now welcome on the telephone Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 
Good morning, Herr Kinkel. 
  [Kinkel] Good morning, Frau [name indistinct]. 
  [Announcer] Clinton and Yeltsin decided yesterday not to 
target their long-range missiles at each other but toward the 
sea. How do you evaluate this decision? 
  [Kinkel] Extraordinarily positive. Everything that 
contributes toward reducing tension and disarmament as a whole 
can only be profoundly welcomed by us. I am pleased that the 
U.S. President went directly to Russia following the NATO 
summit. I welcome greatly the agreement due to be reached today 
with Ukraine as well. That is quite an important area of 
tension, particularly between Russia and Ukraine: the question 
of nuclear arms, the question of the fleet... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] Perhaps we will come to that in a 
moment... 
  [Kinkel, interrupting] There was at least a solution to part 
of this. 
  [Announcer] Is the agreement between Boris Yeltsin and Bill 
Clinton also a first step toward ending the doctrine of 
deterrence, Herr Kinkel, or is it more a matter of cosmetics, 
because the missiles can be retargeted very quickly? 
  [Kinkel] No, I don't think that is a cosmetic move. Rather 
it is a sign that We can say goodbye to the East-West conflict. 
It is very, very important that the two countries, the United 
States and Russia, understand each other well, and I am very 
pleased that the U.S. Government is quite obviously making great 
efforts to involve the still great and important Russia in all 
significant and important issues, particularly in the security 
of Europe. 
  [Announcer] Is Russia still a superpower? 
  [Kinkel] Russia was a world power and it still has huge 
dimensions, 50 times as large as unified Germany, twice as many 
people, and a huge country. 
  [Announcer] Was the atmosphere at the talks between Clinton 
and Yeltsin, the careful NATO approach on new members in 
Brussels, justified in your view, Herr Kinkel? 
  [Kinkel] I think it was. That was our policy, too. Again 
and again I have pointed out that we need a new security 
structure in Europe, that we must not create any new breaks or 
rifts, that we must make a balanced effort to meet the security 
needs of the Central and East European states on the one hand, 
and also meet the interests of Russia and Ukraine on the other 
hand, and I believe the decisions made in Brussels represent a 
good and important beginning. 
  [Announcer] How would you describe the position of Yeltsin 
in 
Moscow, who must proceed carefully and who does not exactly have 
a stable majority? 
  [Kinkel] Well, I think it is a success in the first place 
that there were elections, it is a success that the Constitution 
was adopted. Now we must hope that the forces of reform are 
successful against the extremists, who gained astonishingly good 
results in the Duma elections. I am working on the assumption 
that the forces for reform will win the day; we will support 
them, we must support them, so that the process there toward 
democracy and a market economy becomes irreversible. 
  [Announcer] Is it right then that President Bill Clinton 
should not talk to Zhirinovskiy, should avoid him? 
  [Kinkel] I think that is absolutely right. 
  [Announcer] Let us turn to the nuclear renunciation treaty 
with the Ukraine, Herr Kinkel. How do you evaluate the signing 
today, if it actually happens, after all it is not absolutely 
certain. 
  [Kinkel] That will be a very, very important step toward the 
pacification of that region. During my visit to Russia on 19 
and 20 December I remarked to my opposite number, Kozyrev, how 
much Russian-Ukrainian relations were burdened by the SS-18 and 
SS-24 missiles, and by the issue of the fleet in Sevastopol. We 
were always the ones who strongly urged that Ukraine should sign 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This would be a great step 
forward, one we should not underestimate, and which I welcome 
very much. 
  [Announcer] Herr Kinkel, in view of the fact that the 
agreement still has to be approved by the Ukrainian Parliament, 
how reliable is a signature on such a controversial document 
against the background of political conditions, which are still 
unstable? 
  [Kinkel] Well, Mr. Kravchuk thinks he can get the treaty 
through Parliament. It is no secret that there are very 
conservative forces in the Ukrainian Parliament, and it may well 
be that one or the other, as in the past, will attempt to speak 
against it. I hope that won't happen, I hope that the treaty 
gets through. 
  [Announcer] What does the Ukrainian renunciation mean from 
your point of view for the debate on the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons? 
  [Kinkel] It is quite a decisive step forward. One should not 
forget that Ukraine is still a country with a population of 350 
million, the third largest nuclear power. Ukraine has enormous 
economic difficulties and has quite obviously insisted on 
keeping its nuclear arsenal as a bargaining counter. We must 
see to it very quickly that we help not only Russia but also 
Ukraine. We need a cooperation treaty with the European Union 
and we must do all we can bilaterally as well. You see, the 
foreign ministers at the NATO meeting in Brussels pushed 
extremely strongly for dealing with Ukraine. The economic 
conditions there are much, much more difficult than here. I 
constantly remind people that the hourly wage here is worth half 
a day's wages in Leipzig, a day's wages in Budapest, a month's 
wages in Breslau [Wroclaw], and the same in Ukraine, so you see 
the economic comparison. 
  [Announcer] What is the time span for such aid, 
realistically, because several have to sit down at one table 
together? 
  [Kinkel] It has to be soon. 
  [Announcer] When is soon? 
  [Kinkel] I cannot give you a timeframe in which that will 
happen. Such processes are difficult, it is a problem for the 
G-7, it is a problem for the Europeans. I have pointed to the 
cooperation treaty we are concluding with Russia -- we also need 
one with Ukraine. We must do bilaterally all we can. And I 
must say others will have to do their bit. I am pleased that 
the U.S. President has made such major promises. I would point 
out that we have already pumped in over 80 billion German marks 
into the former Soviet Union, mainly of course into Russia and 
Ukraine. We have done by far the most -- 53 percent of aid so 
far comes from Germany. We do not have to put our light under a 
bushel, the others should do their bit, too.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on poll among German officials on their </F>
attitude toward Russian ultranationalist leader Zhirinovskiy: 
"Poll: How Dangerous is Zhirinovskiy?"] 
  [Text] Hans-Ulrich Klose, head of the Bundestag group of 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany, believes that "the man 
is highly dangerous. There is an example that demonstrates what 
happens if one does not take words seriously -- Hitler!" 
  Wolfgang Schaeuble, head of the Bundestag group of the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, stated: "It 
would be terrible if we had to take him seriously. Yet it would 
also be terrible is a man in his position were not taken 
seriously." 
  The director of the ZDF television station, Dieter Stolte, 
thinks that "it is his irrationality that is so dangerous. His 
spontaneous, emotional, and sometimes aggressive statements are 
a cause for extreme concern in Europe and the world." 
  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany) stated: "The behavior of this man is absolutely 
inappropriate and unacceptable! Denying him a visa was a 
difficult decision, but it was justified. He wanted to start a 
propaganda tour here. We could not accept that." 
  Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in 
Germany, pointed out: "I believe Zhirinovskiy is a man 
controlled by the KGB; four years ago, he wanted to found the 
Jewish community as an agent under orders to the KGB! 
Fortunately we quickly discovered that." 
  Cardinal Georg Sterzinsky stated: "I think he is more 
dangerous than people generally believe him to be. I was in 
Russia in November, where I heard the name for the first time -- 
from people who stressed that the strongest should get the 
votes. He is a populist, a demagogue, and he is attractive for 
politically naive people who want a strong hand." 
  Annemarie Renger (Social Democratic Party of Germany) 
believes that "the man is very dangerous. He is trying to find 
fascist alliance partners in Europe."

<F P=106> [Interview with Brandenburg Leader Manfred Stolpe by Ad </F>
Vaessen; date and place not given: "Minister-President of 
Brandenburg Says `Ossies' Must Beware of Tearful Narcissism"] 
  [Excerpts] The West German media labeled Manfred Stolpe a 
"traitor" and "Stasi spy," but in the former GDR this social 
democrat is the most popular politician. 
  Seated in the back of a VIP van, Dr. Stolpe, prime minister 
pf Brandenburg, says jokingly: "I have just completed a two-year 
anniversary." During that time, not a week went by without new 
accusations being revealed about his work as the highest lawyer 
of the East German Evangelical Church. He supposedly had 
"betrayed" people, had received expensive presents, money, and 
an honorary distinction from the Stasi. 
  There is no conclusive evidence. The sources are mostly 
former Stasi officers who sold their information to the 
tabloids, or to serious newspapers and TV stations for hard 
German marks. In February, an investigative parliamentary 
committee published its final report on this affair. Stolpe, 
who defended his Stasi contacts by pointing out that he had been 
acting on behalf of the church, has some prominent allies. 
Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, for example, is speaking of a 
witch hunt. 
  [Vaessen] Mr. Stolpe, you have bene attacked for two years. 
How do you put up with it? 
  [Stolpe] I am constantly under attack. You only can take 
this if you have a clear conscience, if you know that the 
population is behind you. My faith also gives me strength. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Vaessen] This week Herbert Wehner, the one-time legendary 
leader of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], was 
accused of spying and treason. Will the Stasi ghost play a role 
in the campaigns of this super election year, in which the 
citizens have to go to the polls 19 times? 
  [Stolpe] Count on it. You could say that the attack on 
Wehner is the start of such a campaign. The aim is clear: The 
social democrats in western Germany, who are in a good position, 
have to be discredited. In the western part of the country, 
ghost stories about the Stasi and the KGB undoubtedly make an 
impression on voters. In the eastern part of the country, an 
opposite effect can be observed. 
  On the other hand, I am also anticipating revelations about 
the Christian Democrats and Liberals who are still bearing 
political responsibility at the moment. For example, on the way 
in which they collaborated with Eastern Europe. Let it be clear 
that credibility in politics will be lost. 
  [Vaessen] Do you suspect that Chancellor Kohl's CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union] is behind the attack on Wehner? 
  [Stolpe] I suspect a quite evident political interest on the 
part of people who fear the SPD might become too strong. They 
hope to succeed in damaging the party by slandering the SPD 
patriarch. 
  [Vaessen] The former communists, united in the PDS [Party of 
Democratic Socialism], are gaining votes in the former GDR. The 
extreme right also believes it can benefit. How dangerous is 
the present situation in eastern Germany? 
  [Stolpe] It is not dangerous, but it is a political problem. 
The PDS is swiping our issues before the election campaign, and 
is working in a highly populist manner. They promise everyone 
work, but they do not say how they will finance this. 
  The danger is that the former communists could become rabble 
rousers, striking a cord in people regarding their deepest 
desires, in the same way Chancellor Kohl succeeded in the 1990 
parliamentary elections by promising prosperity for all. 
  [Vaessen] There is much talk of the colonial mentality among 
West Germans. In your party, the roles are not distributed very 
differently. The West German members of the SPD are determining 
what happens, while the East Germans have nothing to say? 
  [Stolpe] I am against any settlement that automatically 
attributes us executive positions merely because we are East 
Germans. It is quite different from the situation in 1989 (the 
year in which the Wall came down -- ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD editor's 
note), when East Germans were carried to the podium. In terms 
of membership numbers, we are small; but there are a relatively 
large number of SPD voters in the east. That should give us 
self-confidence. And we must not be too timid. We must make 
our voice heard. 
  [Vaessen] Do West German politicians have sufficient 
knowledge and understanding for East German problems, such as 
high unemployment, low incomes, poor housing? It is a fact that 
only a few politicians are taking the trouble to acquaint 
themselves on the spot with the situation in the east. 
  [Stolpe] We could say there is a lack of understanding on 
both sides. In the east, people are too quick to claim "they do 
not understand us." We must beware of tearful narcissism, and 
dismal self-pity. We must be frank with our West German 
political allies, and tell each other the hard truth. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "ehr": "Economy Registers Decline in 1993] </F>
  [Text] Last year, Germany's GDP declined by 1.3 percent in 
real terms, according to a report released by the Federal 
Statistical Office yesterday. The GDP in western Germany fell by 
1.9 percent last year, while the GDP in the new laender rose by 
6.3 percent. In their fall reports, the research institutes 
and the Council of Experts had expected the western German 
economy to decline by 2 percent. However, it was only over the 
course of the year that analysts arrived at such pessimistic 
forecasts. In their 1992 fall reports, the institutes still 
talked of the western German economy being "in the doldrums," 
but said a slight improvement was expected in 1993. In the 
course of the year, the forecasts were revised downward, 
although the talk was still of the economy having experienced "a 
dip" and the term "recession" was avoided. 
  At the end of 1992, the Cologne-based Institute for the 
German Economy still stated that a lasting "slump" was unlikely. 
The Munich-based Ifo Institute revised its forecast downward by 
0.5 percent, but also added that the recession would "tend 
toward being mild." The Kiel Institute for the World Economy 
expected "positive signals" in 1993. The German economy 
currently finds itself below ground level, but is still not in 
the cellar. 
  The share of the GDP produced by the new laender is 
continuing to grow. In 1993, 9 percent of the GDP came from the 
new laender, compared to 8 percent in 1992, and 6.9 percent in 
1991. 
  The GDP covers all the services provided by Germans and 
foreigners within the borders of the country over a period of 
one year. It is considered the most appropriate indicator of a 
country's economic performance. Gross National Expenditure, 
which was used previously and finally abandoned by the Federal 
Office of Statistics in September 1992, tends to be more suited 
to reflecting the incomes of the population of a country. The 
second reason for going over to the GDP was that it is customary 
for almost all the large industrial countries to express their 
form in the GDP. In the second quarter of 1992, the difference 
between the Gross National Expenditure and the GDP only amounted 
to 2.3 billion German marks. In addition, at that point, the 
two quantities were growing at the same rate -- that was the 
ideal moment for the statisticians to go over to the GDP.

<F P=106> [Gerhard Hennemann report: "Federal Government Expects </F>
Growth in 1994 -- Unemployment Expected To Increase by Another 
450,000"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 12 Jan -- In its 1994 Annual Economic Report, 
which the cabinet will pass on 26 January, the Federal 
Government expects a real growth rate of between 1 and 1.5 
percent. This forecast does not share the skeptical view of the 
"Five Wise Men" that predicted a stagnation for 1994. Bonn's 
annual forecast is mainly based on a more optimistic evaluation 
of export demand. Due to higher excise taxes and higher social 
insurance contributions, as well as cuts in social benefits, 
private consumption is expected to decrease even further, with a 
3-percent inflation rate. According to the report, the 
unemployment figure could go up by another 450,000, reaching 3.9 
million by the end of 1994. 
  In its draft 1994 Annual Economic Report, which should not 
deviate from the final version to any great extent, the 
government confirms its view that a "solid foundation" has been 
created for an economic upswing. Factors that were once major 
reasons for the recession look "distinctly different" right now. 
Apart from a clear improvement in the world economy, this 
includes a downward trend in wage cost increases, a price 
situation that is cooling, more stable exchange rates, and lower 
interest rates. This means that the starting point for further 
development is "considerably better" than it was a year ago. 
This is especially true for the eastern German economy, where 
housing is becoming the main growth factor. With an 
above-average increase in the new laender, Germany's 1994 
housing investments could increase by up to 7 percent. In 
capital investments, Bonn expects a real growth of 3 to 4 
percent. Due to the tight budget situation, however, it is 
feared that public investment will decline considerably. 
  In spite of improved prospects for exports -- the report 
expects a real increase in exports of goods and services of 3 to 
4 percent, with imports going up by 1 to 2 percent at the same 
time -- the government does not yet expect an upswing that would 
bring about an increase in utilization of production capacity 
and a stabilization of the demand for labor. Much will depend 
on consumers' reactions to drops in their real incomes, 
effective at the beginning of this year. There are, however, 
indications that private consumption will decrease by only 1 
percent, with an inclination toward inhibiting further decline. 
  The Annual Economic Report expects real wage increases of 
between 2.5 and 3 percent for individual employees; with a 
figure of 2 percent in western Germany, and 6.5 to 7.5 percent 
in the new laender. In spite of an increase in mineral oil tax, 
which will effect the inflation rate by 0.5 percent, annual 
average price increases in 1994 are expected to slow down to 3 
percent, and increases spread out over the year, to 2.5 percent. 
Other domestic prices, especially those in the building 
industry, could also increase substantially less than before. 
Even in the new laender, where prices went up by over 9 percent 
in 1993, the government expects price increases of only 5 
percent in 1994. 
  Since the first stage of economic recovery is always linked 
to strong increases in productivity, "considerable cuts in 
employment" must again be expected in 1994, the report says. 
With a total of 3.9 million unemployed people at the end of 
1993, an increase of 450,000 will mainly effect western Germany. 
In eastern Germany, on the other hand, the unemployment rate 
will remain around the current 1.2 million. For Germany as a 
whole, this would result in an increase in the unemployment rate 
from, currently, 8.9 to around 10 percent. Overcoming the 
recession in western Germany remains an absolute precondition 
for ensuring a lasting economic upswing in eastern Germany, the 
report says. This goes for both the dynamics of investments and 
for marketing prospects of eastern German companies, which are 
still far from having made up for their lower productivity.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 13 (AFP) -- United Nations peacekeepers 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina will face greater "risks in the near 
future", French Defence Minister Francois Leotard said here on 
Thursday [13 January]. 
  Leotard was referring to UN plans to reopen the airport at 
the Moslem enclave of Tuzla and to relieve Canadian troops 
blocked in the Srebrenica enclave. 
  Leotard told journalists that if no action was taken, "the 
risks will be even greater if we refuse to carry out the 
essential task of our armies, which is protection of human 
dignity." 
  At Tuzla, the minister said, Swedish peacekeepers "need a 
Danish unit with heavy Leopard tanks and communications systems" 
to allow the airport to be reopened. Effective air support from 
NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) warplanes was also 
needed, he said. 
  The 12 tanks are at present at Pancevo, near Belgrade. They 
will have to skirt Bosnia to the west and be shipped to Split 
before reaching Tuzla by road, an informed source said. 
  Earlier Leotard told the National Assembly's defence 
committee that starting the Tuzla and Srebrenica operations 
depended on UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali who on 
Thursday was due to meet his representative for former 
Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi. 
  A parliamentary sources said that plans were underway for a 
relief corridor between the Dalmatian coast and the capital, 
Sarajevo. 
  Meanwhile in Belgrade, Bosnian Serb chief of staff General 
Manojlo Milovanovic warned that NATO air strikes against Bosnian 
Serb positions would directly threaten the UN Protection Force. 
  In an interview in Thursday's POLITIKA paper, he said: "Let 
them bomb, but by doing so they put the UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Forces] units directly in danger, to say nothing of 
the Croat and Moslem forces in direct contact with the Serb 
forces on all the fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina."

<F P=106> [Article by Olivier Provost and Sophie Seroussi: "Industrial </F>
Contracts: Arms at Half-Mast, Civil Sector Optimistic"] 
  [Text] Following the decision by the Matignon [prime 
minister's office] to cease arms sales to Taiwan and -- like 
Bonn -- to opt clearly for Beijing, two contrasting analyses can 
be heard in French defense circles. The first -- defended by 
those close to the prime minister -- is that "France has already 
sold a good half -- if not three quarters -- of the military 
equipment for which it could find a market in Taiwan. Just a 
few opportunities remained, helicopters, armored vehicles." The 
decision in favor of Beijing does not therefore mean the loss of 
future eldorados. In any event, the Taiwanese arms market is 
saturated for the next two years and a lot can happen at the 
diplomatic level in the meantime. It should also be remembered 
that Paris recently sold 60 Mirage 2000-5's and 1,500 missiles 
worth 30 billion francs [Fr] to Taipei. Plus 16 frigates worth 
Fr28 billion, the arms for which -- worth a further Fr10 
billion -- were the subject of the final authorization from 
Paris for arms sales to Taipei, in October 1993. This 
authorization should not be in any doubt. 
  The second interpretation is that Balladur has just pulled 
the rug out from under the French arms manufacturers such as the 
manufacturers of armored vehicles, Panhard or RVI [expansion not 
given], but above all the Matra missile manufacturer, which 
dreamed of equipping -- in addition to the Mirages -- the 150 
U.S. aircraft also purchased by Taipei. There is great 
disappointment at Dassault. The aircraft manufacturer was 
hoping to be supplying a further batch of 60 Mirages in the long 
term. In addition, the France's support for Taiwan --while 
Beijing was arming Iran -- served to reassure other possible 
customers (Malaysia, Arab states). Finally, the contract for the 
60 Mirages contains a cancelation clause "for technical reasons" 
valid for the first 18 aircraft, and this could now jeopardize 
the complete deal. 
<H5>  News Greeted With Enthusiasm </H5>
  In the civil sector, French manufacturers are now rejoicing 
after having been denied their share of the Chinese economic 
boom for the past two years. The images of German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl returning from Beijing in November with contracts 
worth Fr16 billion no doubt had a lot to do with the decision. 
Not a day has passed without the Matignon and ministers being 
besieged by industrialists, furious at not being able to profit 
along with their European competitors from China's economic 
boom. Last year, the Chinese gold mine brought orders for 
foreign firms worth nearly Fr600 billion! 
  Since the signature of the final arms contracts with Taiwan, 
everything had been blocked: loss of the Canton underground 
railway market which GEC Alsthom had its eyes on and which went 
to the Germans, the blocking of contracts worth Fr2 billion for 
Alcatel CIT for telephone exchanges, and of the new nuclear 
power station at Daya-Bay which Framatome had hoped to win. In 
order to sell any aircraft, Airbus had to go through Deutsche 
Aerospace. Today it is celebrating: The 12 planes sold to 
Taiwan are nothing compared to the 35 now ordered by the Chinese 
and the 200 Airbuses they hope to sell by the year 2005. In 
all, according to the CNPF [National Council of French 
Employers], between Fr3 and 6 billion were lost in 1993 on major 
contracts in China. Which gives some idea of the enthusiasm 
with which French manufacturers greeted the news. "The Chinese 
market is far larger than the Taiwanese market," Alcatel Alsthom 
is pleased to report. Rather than shedding any tears over the 
nuclear power station and the Taiwan high-speed train, the group 
prefers to look to the future. As do the other French 
manufacturers who are counting on winning potential contracts 
worth tens of billions of francs in the automobile industry, 
railway equipment, environment, telecommunications, and 
buildings and public works sectors.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Renaud Girard: "Compromise Diplomacy: France </F>
Chooses To Forsake Taiwan in Order To Regain Access to the 
Chinese Market"] 
  [Text] "Has the prime minister not lost sight of the fact 
that any great foreign policy needs a modicum of fortitude?" 
Such was the question being asked yesterday in the lobbies of 
the National Assembly by several members of the Foreign Affairs 
Commission. They added that after "giving in to Iranian 
threats" by sending two presumed terrorists back to Tehran even 
though they were wanted by Swiss authorities, France, by letting 
itself be pressured into tearing up its policy concerning the 
sale of weapons to Taiwan, "allows China to treat it differently 
than it does the United States." 
  Here is the gist of the official statement, released 
yesterday: "Aware of China's concerns, the French Government 
undertakes not to allow French companies to contribute to 
Taiwan's armament in the future." Last year, the PRC had been 
enraged by the announcement that France would sell 60 Mirage 
2000 fighter aircraft and six frigates to Taiwan. The contracts 
were vital for the French arms manufacturing sector -- France 
being the world's second biggest arms exporter after the United 
States. China had retaliated by unilaterally closing down the 
French Consulate in Canton. 
<H5>  United States Unaffected </H5>
  And yet, the French were not the first Western nation to 
decide to sell weapons to Taiwan. After the Tiananmen Square 
massacre (1989), the Americans had gone back on their 1982 
pledge not to sell any more weapons to Taiwan. Last July, a 
vote at the House of Representatives had even confirmed and 
broadened the U.S. policy change. Furthermore, in terms of 
volume, the U.S. armament contracts (supplying 150 F-16 
fighter-bomber aircraft and leasing a number of frigates) are 
more than twice as large as the French ones. And yet Beijing 
has not implemented any retaliation measures against the United 
States, thus clearly breaking Mao's old iron law which states 
that "China treats all nations, whether small or large, on an 
equal footing." 
  At the time, the announcement of the armament contract with 
Taiwan had not been criticized in France nor in the United 
States. As shown by the December 1992 parliamentary election, 
the Taiwan regime, turning its back to the Kuomintang 
dictatorship, has become a Western-style democracy. Although 
strictly unofficial, relations between thriving Taiwan and 
mainland China are quite strong: Through intermediaries 
operating from Hong Kong, "nationalist" Chinese have become the 
leading investors in Communist China, thus contributing to the 
latter's extraordinary economic growth. However, the PRC -- 
sole holder of Chinese sovereignty in the eye of both the French 
and the U.S. Government -- has still not abandoned the idea of 
forcibly bringing back into the fold the island, which seceded 
in 1949. In such a context, asks a Western diplomat, "can one 
prevent Taiwan from acquiring what it needs in order to 
discourage Beijing's intentions?" 
  This same diplomat adds: "Sooner or later, the French 
Government, which is usually just as ready to uphold the cause 
of democracy as it is to protect its interests vis-a-vis the 
United States, will have to dispel the ambiguity."

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Gilbert: "After Mitterrand, Chirac Has Come </F>
`To Turn The Page'"] 
  [Text] Above all, the president of the RPR [Rally for the 
Republic] highlighted international policy, though not without 
denouncing the misdeeds of the bureaucracy, and reiterated his 
commitment to human rights. 
  Like Francois Mitterrand, who came last February, Jacques 
Chirac had never set foot in Vietnam. While the president of the 
republic naturally began his trip in Hanoi, the mayor of Paris 
was first received in Ho Chi Minh City, previously known as 
Saigon. In fact, the entire government has just completed a 
sitting lasting several days in the capital of South Vietnam. 
Accordingly, it was at the Palace of Unity, the presidential 
residence of the old regime, that Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, 
flanked by nearly 10 ministers and in the presence of the French 
ambassador, welcomed Mr. Chirac with the words: "Mr. Mayor of 
Paris, you are a great Frenchman. What an honor it is to 
receive you!" 
  No reference here to de Gaulle, then, like in Cambodia, in 
describing the visit of his "spiritual heir." The general has 
no place in Vietnamese mythology. What the Vietnamese leaders 
wanted to show is the relationship between the two trips made by 
Mitterrand and Chirac respectively, the consolidation of a 
rediscovered history between the two countries. The speech by 
Vo Van Kiet, the words spoken by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van 
Khai, the patron of economic "liberalization," during their 
conversation, or the short speech by the mayor-governor of the 
city were built up along the same lines: 1993 began with 
Mitterrand, 1994 with Chirac, that is the real "evidence of our 
cooperation." 
  Quite obviously, the trip by the president, sanctioning 
France's return to Indochina, left behind an excellent memory. 
Mr. Chirac paid him homage: "The president of the republic 
said that a fresh page had been turned. I believe he was 
right." And, just as Francois Mitterrand had evoked "the 
regrettable chapter" of French-Vietnamese history by visiting 
the site of Dien Bien Phu, Jacques Chirac added: "The year 1994 
will also mark the 40th anniversary of the most regrettable 
episode of our shared history. Let us take care not to forget 
the past. However, let us also turn to the future, starting off 
again hand in hand..." While the authorities, overcome with 
gratitude, multiplied their thanks to France for its development 
aid and support in reintegrating Vietnam into the international 
financial community, Jacques Chirac assured them that "the new 
French government certainly intends to continue, and even 
consolidate, the policy of its forerunner in this respect." 
  If the Vietnamese leaders greatly stressed the relationship 
between the dates of the two visits, it was because they 
themselves felt the need to draw up the balance of their action, 
a really self-satisfied balance, on the eve of the "national 
congress" of their party, which is to be held before the end of 
January. It is clear that the tempo of the "renovation" is 
stirring up a debate among their executives. How can the 
political conservatism, which they are keeping in place, and 
economic activism, for which they are preaching the need, be 
reconciled? Their faith in the system is expressed in a 
language which today seems rather anachronistic, exalting the 
"objectives of the struggle" and the references "to the 
decisions made by the previous congress." Vo Van Kiet, 71, grew 
up under the Vietminh apparat and knew how to play the smiling 
front. He reminded the mayor of Paris that he had himself been 
the mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, then hardened and dropped the 
smile to affirm that "the preservation of political stability 
remains the condition for economic development." 
  Mr. Chirac, who steered well clear of entering into the 
ideological debate, limited himself to diversifying his message 
depending on the function of his dialogue partners. In the 
presence of the mayor of Saigon, he made a real charge against 
bureaucracy "which is causing a great deal of time to be lost 
and is costing the people very dearly. Given the political 
will, this problem can be overcome....but everywhere bureaucracy 
is the enemy of the people." 
<H5>  The French Dream </H5>
  Speaking with economist Phan Van Khai, he listed the 
"interests" at stake in the relationship between the two 
countries, highlighting the dual singularity of the French 
contribution: investment and the transfer of technologies. 
Full of praise, in passing, for Industry Minister Gerard 
Longuet, who leaves for Vietnam on Friday in command of a 
squadron of 40 industrialists, he said: "You will see, this is 
a boy who probably has a future in French politics. He does not 
belong to my party. He is the leader of our brother party...." 
  In fact, the RPR president devoted the lion's share of his 
talks to international policy, especially the balance within the 
Pacific region, incessantly reiterating the nuclear threat posed 
by North Korea. Vo Van Kiet admitted that he had observed the 
same concern in South Korea and Japan. 
  Would Mr. Chirac make a public observation on human rights 
infringements in Vietnam? One sentence uttered to Vo Van Kiet, 
reiterated that after opening up economically, "the road to a 
new openness will then be free, an openness which concerns 
relations between people." However, the French ambassador also 
delivered a note concerning the "individual [human rights] 
cases" already raised by Mr. Mitterrand, then by Mr. Juppe last 
July. 
  The Vietnamese received Chirac: One year away from the 
presidential election, they took their assurances from this 
considerable French political figure regarding the continuity of 
French policy. Jacques Chirac visited Saigon and Hanoi: In 
both cities, he wanted to consecrate the French dream in 
Vietnam, particularly by committing himself to joint projects 
and undertakings using the vehicle of the French language: a 
visit to the Lotus school (financed by the City of Paris) in 
Saigon, and to the Viet-Duc hospital in Hanoi.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Couvrat: "Government Accountancy: </F>
Reduced Budget, But Exploding Debt"] 
  [Text] Parliament has adopted the five-year law aimed at 
bringing public finances under control. It seemingly reduces 
the public deficit, but that is not preventing the national debt 
from growing. 
  The Parliament has just definitively adopted the five-year 
law aimed at bringing state finances under control. On the face 
of it, this commitment to austerity is squeezing the government 
into an unbearably tight corset: Each year it will have to 
reduce the budget deficit drastically with a view to bringing it 
down to 2.5 percent of GDP by 1997. However, there is good 
reason to wonder about the sincerity of the exercise, as the 
national debt is habitually increased by the addition of 
expenses that do not appear in the budget. In two years, from 
the end of 1992 to the end of 1994, the budget deficit will be 
reduced to 617 billion French francs [Fr]. However, the 
national debt has increased by Fr809, an extra one-third. 
  The aim of the five-year law is to satisfy the convergence 
criteria laid down by the Maastricht Treaty. The candidates for 
the single currency, in 1997 at the earliest, must not record a 
national debt in excess of 3 percent of GDP. For France, whose 
budget deficit reached 4.5 percent of GDP in 1993, not counting 
the social security deficits and those of the local authorities, 
this is no easy undertaking. 
  It boils down to reducing the national deficit by 0.5 
percent 
of GDP each year for four years, starting in 1994. However, the 
state has irreducible expenses, starting with those incurred as 
a result of the national debt, on which heavy interest has to be 
paid each year. Not to mention the salaries of civil servants, 
the reduction of whose numbers would appear to be a more urgent 
priority than ever, but whose pay rises correspond to previously 
agreed contractual commitments. In short, any effort to cut 
spending can only be made in other areas: civil and military 
equipment and actions, the budget for which would have to be 
reduced by approximately 2 percent per annum in real terms. 
Would it be feasible to envision reducing employment subsidies 
to the same extent? 
  However, the government has subjected itself to additional 
constraints which will increase its future expenditure even 
further. The budgeting of family allowances will cost Fr40 
billion in 1997, and transfers to UNEDIC [National Union for 
Industrial and Commercial Employment] will reach a level of Fr10 
billion per year. That makes a total of Fr50 billion, or 0.8 
percent of GDP by 1997. Will the return to growth suffice to 
absorb this increase? Nicolas Sarkozy [budget minister] seemed 
slightly optimistic, affirming the other evening to the National 
Assembly: "The objective of this government is to use any room 
for maneuver that a more rapid return to sustained growth may 
entail, and a better mastery of public expenditure, to reduce 
the fiscal and social contributions." 
  To be sure, the government has more than one trick up its 
sleeve. Last year, it transferred Fr45 billion to companies, 
under the pretext of compensating for the one-month VAT 
[value-added tax] gap, and by the same token recognized a 
residual debt of between Fr50 and Fr55 billion. That makes 
roughly Fr100 billion in all financed through borrowing, which 
did not figure under budgetary expenditure. No more so than the 
return-to-school allowance (Fr5.9 billion), an expense 
attributed directly to the national debt, which in turn already 
assumed the accumulated social security debt, to the extent of 
Fr110 billion, on 1 January 1994. 
  It will be tempting to review such tricks of sleight of hand 
in the future, in order to meet the requirements of the 
five-year law without putting the brakes on real state 
expenditure. Abolishing, say, state subsidies to the social 
security system, while making it support the corresponding cash 
advances -- along the lines of the operation concerning the 
back-to-school allowance. Unless the finicky observers in the 
government Audit Office succeed in making themselves heard.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We are clearly drawing closer 
to the early dissolution of the chambers of parliament and the 
consequent general election. If anyone still had any doubts, 
then those doubts were removed a short time ago -- half an hour 
ago -- by a communique from the Quirinale [president's office]. 
The communique says: In accordance with Article 88 of the 
Constitution, tomorrow morning President Scalfaro will receive 
Senate Speaker Spadolini at the Quirinale at 1130, and he will 
receive [Chamber of Deputies Speaker] Napolitano at 1700 that 
afternoon. [passage omitted] 
  The Quirinale's communique says, I repeat: In accordance 
with Article 88. This is the article concerned with the early 
dissolution of the chambers of parliament, and it stipulates 
that the president should consult with the Senate speaker first 
and then with the Chamber of Deputies speaker before proceeding 
to dissolve parliament. The chambers should be dissolved by 
Sunday [16 January], when [President] Scalfaro will then set 
aside his reservations about Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi's resignation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] This, the 11th legislature, is closing amid anger 
and satisfaction. Most of those disappointed are to be found in 
what was the four-party coalition, while some of the harshest 
reactions have come from the Christian Democrats [DC]. [DC 
leader Mino] Martinazzoli said the government has had a short 
life. He wanted elections to be held in June. Guido 
Dell'Aquila has carried out some interviews: 
  [Begin recording] [Gerardo Bianco, DC spokesman in the 
Chamber of Deputies] I was not expecting this outcome because 
the position taken in parliament by the majority parties 
reconfirmed confidence in the government. In other words, 
Ciampi and his government still have a parliamentary majority, 
so the justification for his resignation has origins outside 
parliament. 
  [Marco Pannella, Radical leader] The country knows that 
everything is once again in the hands of the institutional 
authorities, which certainly offers a wealth of wisdom and 
honesty to the whole country. 
  [Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the Left leader] 
Today's action is important because it is the only pacifying 
action which can be implemented in our country. It gives 
citizens the instrument of a parliament which truly represents 
the new Italy and hopefully a government with progressive forces 
at its center. 
  [Umberto Bossi, Northern League leader] It is a government 
which has remained in office despite the fact that the whole 
country wants change, wants an election. It seems to me that 
consequently a legitimate action is being carried out. It seems 
to me that Ciampi has upheld civil liberties -- he has kept his 
word. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Stefano Livadiotti and Maurizio Maggi: "And </F>
After Ciampi, Carlo Azeglio"] 
  [Text] In L'ESPRESSO's exclusive poll of 
Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] 
members, Segni's support is reduced by half, and 93 out of 100 
oppose Berlusconi. The industrialists believe the former 
governor of the Bank of Italy should remain in office. They do 
not see the economy recovering before 1995 and fear there will 
be massive layoffs. 
  The industrialists have finally decided that the best option 
is to stick with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. The head of government 
may not be the authentic magician of economic recovery that some 
had expected, but he has succeeded in achieving more than one 
concrete result. And after all, there is no alternative. The 
year 1994, in fact, will also be a gloomy year. The production 
system will function at a minimum level, and in the meantime, 
unemployment will continue to flourish. In this context, the 
helm of Italy, Inc., should be entrusted to safe hands. It is 
therefore not advisable to run risks, as for example by backing 
a Silvio Berlusconi who vacillates between the neofascists of 
Gianfranco Fini and the Lega troops of Umberto Bossi. 
  The results of the L'ESPRESSO poll that interviewed half of 
the Confindustria assembly (77 out of 157 members of the 
council) demonstrate that the Italian entrepreneurs have a 
specific objective and are marching in close formation to attain 
it. Here, point by point, are the names of the men on whom the 
industrialists have decided to put their money, what the 
industrialists' predictions are for 1994, and what solution they 
are proposing for emerging from the tunnel of the recession. 
<H5>  Ciampi for President [preceding words in English] </H5>
  After passing through a minor crisis of credibility, the 
former governor of the Bank of Italy is beginning to regain 
support in the business community. When he was sworn in at 
Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister], he was greeted 
with enthusiasm: a poll L'ESPRESSO conducted in May 1993 gave 
him--on faith--a 7.0 approval rating. A slow decline then began, 
and in the space of two months his rating dropped to 6.6, 
leveling off at 6.4 in September. This trend has now been 
reversed. The passage of the budget bill on schedule, and the 
success obtained by the sale of the Italian Credit Bank (after 
the sale, 52 percent of the industrialists said they were 
convinced that the privatizations will actually be carried out) 
caused Ciampi's rating to begin slowly to rise again, to 6.6. 
And a majority (more than 52 percent) are asking him--in a loud 
voice--to remain at Palazzo Chigi. 
  "The government has perhaps lacked decision-making 
initiative 
to some extent," Giancarlo Lombardi, a textile manufacturer and 
respected member of the Confindustria council, maintains, "but 
you have to give the prime minister credit for keeping the 
promises he made and for performing with a certain style." 
Walter Mandelli, the former vice president of the entrepreneurs, 
agrees. "The head of government and his cabinet," he says, "have 
given proof of their good faith by holding fast to an economic 
policy line that is widely shared." Even Ernesto Gismondi, vice 
president of CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor], is 
in favor of giving him a passing grade. "In the temporary phase 
that began with the earthquake caused by the kickback scandal," 
he says, "Ciampi is successfully performing the function of 
administrator of a company that is in receivership." 
  A better job can be done: This is the slogan of his 
unconditional critics who continue to be represented in the 
Confindustria assembly. "The former governor of the Bank of 
Italy has not measured up to expectations," explains 
Confindustria council member Paolo Passanti, who is associated 
with the organization's research center. "He has not been 
sufficiently courageous in making decisions on the more 
important questions, as for example the problem of how to 
contain the cost of money and combat unemployment." 
  In any case, the financial statement for the past three 
months also shows a favorable balance for Ciampi. Specifically, 
in the sample polled by L'ESPRESSO, those who say they are 
disappointed by the performance of the former governor of the 
Bank of Italy dropped to 32 percent from the 38 percent recorded 
in September, while those who judge him to be more capable than 
they could have anticipated rose during the same period to 14.5 
percent from 9 percent. 
<H5>  Professor: You Flunked </H5>
  Four passing grades and two failing grades: Two-thirds of 
the 
team of economic ministers got a passing grade from the 
industrialists who gave the exam. Judged to be the most capable 
was Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, who was largely credited 
with getting the privatizations under way (he scored a 6.3). He 
shared the awards platform, however, with Budget Minister Luigi 
Spaventa and Industry Minister Paolo Savona, each with a 6.2. 
Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta also passed, albeit by the 
skin of his teeth (with a 6.0). 
  Thumbs down, however, on the two Socialist ministers, Franco 
Gallo (Finance) and Gino Giugni (Labor). As far as the 
industrialists are concerned, these two can stay at home 
permanently. 
<H5>  Go Back, Sir </H5>
  If Ciampi is the best player on the field, the 
industrialists' backup is named Mario Segni. But because the 
referendum leader could not decide which side to take or with 
whom to ally himself, he began to lose support: in June 1992, 49 
percent of the entrepreneurs wanted him in Palazzo Chigi, 
whereas his support has now been reduced to a more modest 25.7 
percent. 
  After Ciampi and Segni, there is a void. The PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left], to be sure, is no longer a problem. Almost 
three out of four entrepreneurs insist that they would not be 
frightened if it were installed in the control room. For 
example, Lombardi maintains that "despite some contradictions, a 
significant part of the PDS has opted for a pro-market policy, 
and if it were to be invested with the responsibilities of 
government, it would be constrained to do everything possible to 
keep its promises." But even if the former Communist Party no 
longer causes fear, there is little confidence in the ability of 
its leadership [preceding word in English] to lead: in the poll, 
for example, PDS Secretary Achille Occhetto received not a 
single vote for prime minister, and only three out of 100 
industrialists indicated that they were fans of Chamber of 
Deputies President Giorgio Napolitano. 
  The doors are also barred against Silvio Berlusconi. When in 
recent weeks he announced that he was prepared to sacrifice 
himself and take the field personally to halt the advance of the 
left, His TV Eminence [pun on Italian word emittenza] 
was, as usual, outspoken: "I want the leaders of industry, he 
said." But they--the entrepreneurs--do not appear to be as 
eager. Indeed, the poll results speak quite frankly; they say 
that 93 percent of the Confindustria assembly has no intention 
whatsoever of backing the boss of Fininvest. Not only do they 
not intend to support the gentleman from Arcore, but they do not 
even want him as the head of government, inasmuch as among his 
own colleagues, "Burlesquoni"--as the authoritative ECONOMIST 
renamed him in a headline--garnered only a handful of votes. 
"Let us rise up and join hands," says Forza Italia, the party 
song of his new party. If it were to be played in the hall where 
Confindustria's council meets, 93 entrepreneurs out of 100 would 
remain seated comfortably in their armchairs. In short, there 
would be too few to play ring-around-the-rosey. 
<H5>  Things Look Bad From Here </H5>
  Whether it be Ciampi or Segni, what is wanted is an 
authoritative leader. The fact is that in 1994 we will need 
binoculars to see the economic recovery ahead. The forecasts 
developed by Confindustria's top leadership and presented on 
Tuesday, 14 December, speak of a 1.6 percent growth of the GNP, 
sufficient to make it possible basically to maintain employment 
levels and, according to associates of Confindustria President 
Luigi Abete, the year should end with a loss of only 20,000 
jobs, equal to less than 0.1 percent. The rank and file of the 
entrepreneurs, however, do not put much stock in these 
estimates. "Abete and his people have to appear to be 
optimistic," Enzo Giustino, president of the Campania 
industrialists, explains, "because if they told how things 
really are, they would wind up scaring the bankers to death and 
cause the stock market to crash." 
  The picture painted by the 77 industrialists polled by 
L'ESPRESSO was, therefore, a darker one, although they 
acknowledged that the worst may have passed. In September, 
almost 90 percent of the companies said they had an assured 
supply of work for only the six ensuing months, whereas today 
that figure has dropped to 75 percent. They are unwilling to bet 
so much as half a lira that a substantial recovery will take 
place in 1994. In fact, six out of ten entrepreneurs say that 
Italy, Inc., will have a growth rate next year of no more than 1 
percent. 
  On the other hand, if the recovery is delayed, the 
hemorrhage 
of jobs will continue. On this front, the optimism of the 
Confindustria leadership is truly at odds with the forecasts of 
its rank and file: two out of three of those polled said they 
are sure that the personnel of their companies will suffer a new 
and heavy blow. 
<H5>  How To Stay Afloat </H5>
  The Italian industrialists' prescription for getting through 
1994 intact--and for duly keeping their appointment with 
economic recovery--consists of only a few points. 
  On the fiscal front, the entrepreneurs are calling for a 
decisive crackdown on those categories that have always been 
suspected of being involved most heavily in the practice of tax 
evasion: a list headed by professionals, followed closely by 
merchants and artisans. However, the proposal that all unearned 
income be included on "Form 740"--so that all such income would 
be taxed on a progressive basis--is also gaining support: 48 
percent of the sample said they now favored this option, 
probably out of a conviction that the stock exchange would have 
everything to gain from a reform of this type. 
  More taxes, but also less spending. According to the 
industrialists, the government's axe should come down hard on 
the public sector and not spare either public health, pensions, 
education, or--why not?--the Armed Forces. It is a veritable 
declaration of war.

began with that and continued -- evoking the shadow of Russia's 
fascist leader, who has just been expelled from Bulgaria and 
rejected by Germany -- by painting the unseen portrait of the 
Great Right which he dreams of presenting at the next elections. 
A surprising picture, with some paradoxical features: It is 
virtually a complex of civil liberties advocacy, solidarism, and 
Third Worldism. 
  [Brusadelli] Why is the leader of the Italian right 
disowning 
the leader of the Russian right? 
  [Fini] I repeat: Zhirinovskiy is not of the right. He is not 
a nationalist like me; he is an imperialist. He has latched 
onto a feeling that has been present in the Russian people since 
Czarist times, a feeling which communism heightened. 
  [Brusadelli] Yet it is proving difficult to place 
Zhirinovskiy anywhere outside the right. 
  [Fini] He is a product of the decline of the former USSR. He 
is a complex of a number of typical Russian impulses, such as 
the desire for a strongman and anti-Semitism, all of which is 
supported by a powerful military caste. 
  [Brusadelli] So which European right-wing movements do you 
like? 
  [Fini] That is not easy to answer. There is no international 
organization for the Right because there is no ideology of the 
Right. In my opinion, the Right is the concrete response to 
everyday problems. However, those of us in Strasbourg are in a 
mixed group. 
  [Brusadelli] A situation of isolation.... 
  [Fini] We are working to introduce the MSI to other European 
political forces. I would exclude out of hand any link with 
neo-Nazis. With them there is the insurmountable discrimination 
of racism, whereas we are rooted in solidarity. 
  [Brusadelli] Try to describe an MSI proposal for an 
international policy. 
  [Fini] The agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis 
marks a major opportunity for Italy, as well as a major problem. 
Germany is concentrating on investments in the east. At this 
juncture, Italy should contrast the German choice and encourage 
Europe to concentrate on the Middle East market. For us this 
would present a twofold advantage: It would slow down 
immigration from that area and would have faster economic 
returns via oil. Moreover, southern Italy could really take off. 
  [Brusadelli] Great, but we will have to see what [League 
leader] Umberto Bossi thinks of this.... 
  [Fini] That is true. He is thinking of an Italy coupled to 
the German locomotive, while I am thinking of an Italy steeped 
in the Mediterranean. 
  [Brusadelli] So there will be no agreement with Bossi? 
  [Fini] We agree on tax protest, crime, and bribe city. But 
we have nothing in common on European policy, the national 
identity, and the issue of solidarism. 
  [Brusadelli] What do you mean by solidarism? 
  [Fini] We are aware of the duty of solidarity, not only 
between individuals, but also between rich and poor regions. 
  [Brusadelli] And when you want to drive out non-European 
Community citizens, where is the solidarism then? 
  [Fini] I have just presented a proposal aimed at improving 
their conditions -- but in their own countries, not here in 
Italy where nobody can ensure them a decent quality of life. 
  [Brusadelli] Tell me what you would have to hear from Bossi 
in order to reach an agreement. 
  [Fini] That Italy is one and indivisible and that the 
Italian 
people is a single people -- without [League ideologue] Miglio 
and Rocchetta saying the opposite thing the next day. 
  [Brusadelli] Will you see Bossi in the next few days? 
  [Fini] He is currently talking to [Judge] Di Pietro -- 
something that will certainly not happen to me. 
  [Brusadelli] Do you, like your mayors, feel that [Fininvest 
President] Berlusconi is the ideal ally? 
  [Fini] He has the merit of not using smoke screens in 
politics. 
  [Brusadelli] Would you like to see him in the Palazzo Chigi 
[government seat]? 
  [Fini] I do not think he wants to go there, and besides it 
would not be a solution. During a period of reconstruction, it 
is politics which should lead the economy, not vice-versa. 
  [Brusadelli] Would it be better to have [Pact for Italy 
leader] Mario Segni at the Palazzo Chigi? 
  [Fini] He is the leader of those who are pushing for reform. 
Today he is the anti-PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
candidate. At the local elections he supported the PDS 
candidates. 
  [Brusadelli] So, at the end of the day, the moderate front 
risks remaining without a candidate to lead the government. 
  [Fini] I think that at the end of the day neither of the two 
fronts will manage to agree on a candidate. 
  [Brusadelli] It also seems that the MSI has been somewhat 
sidelined.... 
  [Fini] I am not someone who longs to enter good society. 
However, I will not be accused of being the person who sabotaged 
an agreement. I am certain about one thing: Without us, the 
anti-PDS pole will lose. 
  [Brusadelli] Will the anti-[Christian Democratic Party 
Secretary] Martinazzoli secessionists end up in the National 
Alliance? 
  [Fini] We will not say no to a dialogue with them. However, 
let us be clear: There is no room in our house for people under 
investigation. 
  [Brusadelli] What will the National Alliance's symbol be? 
  [Fini] We are working on it. We are certain that the [MSI 
symbol] flame will be part of it. The MSI will be the most 
conspicuous component of the Alliance. I will give you an 
example: In Rome, out of 24 candidates, about 15 will be from 
the MSI.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anti-Mafia Commission President Luciano </F>
Violante by Liana Milella; place and date not given: "The Mafia 
May Strike Near Election Time."] 
  [Text] Organized Crime: The president of the 
Anti-Mafia Commission speaks out. During 1993, there have been 
some great successes in the war against Cosa Nostra, but the 
next few months could hold some explosive surprises in store for 
us. 
  One hundred sixty-one Mafia gangs under investigation, with 
a 
total of 2,813 members of Cosa Nostra, the Camorra, and the 
'ndrangheta. The Sacred United Crown under observation; 580 
informers; 236 major fugitives arrested, including Toto Riina, 
the head of Cosa Nostra, and his deputy, Nitto Santapaola; 
Rosetta Cutolo and Umberto Ammaturo from the Camorra; and 
Pasquale Condello and Antonino Imerti, 'ndrangheta bosses. The 
people who carried out the Capaci [Judge Falcone] massacre were 
arrested, and there is a good chance that arrests will also be 
made in connection with the Via D'Amelio [Judge Borsellino] 
attack. In 1993, the war against crime reached levels never 
before seen in Italy.The center of analysis and impetus was the 
Anti-Mafia Parliamentary Commission. Together with the 
commission's president, Luciano Violante, PANORAMA has 
established what has been done and what remains to be done. 
  [Milella] Have we reached a Nuremburg for Cosa Nostra? 
  [Violante] Nuremburg came after the military defeat and 
followed the political sanctioning of that defeat. Today, we are 
only at the landing of the Allies in Normandy. We are at the 
point where the state is beginning to invade the territories 
dominated by the Mafia. The military victory may be near, but 
that by itself is not enough. The financial and social fronts 
must still be addressed. In 1993, Cosa Nostra killed the parish 
priest of Brancaccio, Don Pino Puglisi. It was not a 
neighborhood murder, rather the first attack against a man who 
had chosen to work with the people against the Mafia. 
  [Milella] At the political crimes trial, Riina chose not to 
speak in front of Tommaso Buscetta. Is it the beginning of the 
end for the Mafia? 
  [Violante] All the organizations have suffered severe blows. 
But Cosa Nostra's trafficking continues, and the Camorra and the 
'ndrangheta are still underestimated. The 'ndrangheta is a very, 
very dangerous organization because of its connections with 
subversive elements on the right and the corrupt Masonic lodges. 
The Camorra is dangerous because of its control over the 
territory. In Sicily, there are some free zones, but not in 
Campania. You have not won if you defeat only Cosa Nostra. We 
risk winning in Sicily and losing in the rest of Italy. 
  [Milella] What effect have the arrests of the big bosses and 
all the informers had? 
  [Violante] We have won many battles, but not the war. In the 
end we will win that, too, but we will have to pay a different 
price. Many more on our side will be killed. We have to isolate 
the Mafia. The public has often lived with this phenomenon: the 
doctors who fake certificates as favors; shop owners who launder 
dirty money; the lawyers who act as counselors. All this must 
stop. And, to a certain degree, it already is stopping. 
  [Milella] There are allegedly more shocking strikes being 
prepared. What does the Mafia hope to obtain? Can it be stopped? 
  [Violante] Until now, we have had two types of attacks. One 
kind is extermination, the elimination of a single enemy, like 
the judges Gaetano Costa and Rocco Chinnici. The other kind is 
one of dialogue: the bombs in the spring and summer protesting 
the harsh prison conditions resulting from the modifications 
made in July 1992 to Article 41bis of the prison regulations. We 
have not yet had strikes aimed at obstructing, which have the 
same function as the gunfire of a patrol in protecting behind 
the front lines in earning time. In the future, this is the kind 
we will have to deal with. 
  [Milella] Then why are they targeting individuals like you, 
like prosecutor Giancarlo Caselli and the head of DIA, Gianni De 
Gennaro? 
  [Violante] The fact that there are so many objectives proves 
my theory. The murders of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, 
just two months apart, already signaled the beginning of this 
strategy. It is project of extermination targeting all the 
strong points. 
  [Milella] Will the state have the strength to stand up to 
it? 
  [Violante] Many massacres have already been avoided. Many 
people are alive thanks to measures of prevention. Making an 
attack more difficult is already a step ahead, as is arresting 
the suspected perpetrators. 
  [Milella] After the bombings of Rome, Florence, and Milan, 
there was talk of Mafia terrorism, of an alliance between the 
Mafia, Masons, extremists on the right, and government secret 
agents who have turned traitors. Is this still a valid theory? 
  [Violante] The Mafia does not act alone. The criminal 
elements from Sicily, Campania, and Calabria have always had 
ties with the extremists on the right. It happened in the past 
with the massacre of train 904. Today, we have a former member 
of the New Order movement and of the Mafia, Pietro Rampulla, 
arrested for the Capaci ambush. Rosario Cattafi from Messina is 
involved in the traffic of arms. There is Domenico Papalia, a 
'ndrangheta boss who, thanks to a unique appeal, was able to 
have his murder trial overturned. Papalia was the first name 
mentioned by Antonino Gioe, the Mafioso who killed himself in 
prison. 
  [Milella] That alliance was not just a theoretical 
assumption? 
  [Violante] There exists a system of subversive forces, each 
with its own history and its own goals, which sometimes happen 
to act together. Just think of the corrupt Masonic lodges that 
were key elements in the relationships. Members of the 
Calabrian, Sicilian, Mafias, etc., belong to the same lodge. 
What we are seeing is the Mafia making use of the Masonic system. 
  [Milella] In 1993, political men who were thought to be 
untouchable, like Giulio Andreotti and Antonio Gava, found 
themselves under investigation. What is changing in the 
relationship between the Mafia and politics? Who are the Mafia's 
new contacts? 
  [Violante] I do not know if Senator Andreotti and Senator 
Gava are criminally responsible. Very likely, the top levels of 
the Mafia leadership are now waiting to see what will happen. If 
a separatist political proposition--under whatever name or 
guise--were to go ahead, it would be an incredible opportunity 
for them. The Mafia, which makes investments in its 
relationships with politics, is now waiting to see. It could be 
that it is waiting to ally itself with the future winner. 
Everyone must keep their eyes open. 
  [Milella] Is the Mafias also trying to sabatoge the 
investigations by influencing the informers? 
  [Violante] There could be a strategy of infiltration aimed 
for the most part, not at getting false testimony or stopping 
the trials, but at finding out where the former Mafiosi are 
being held, how they are being guarded, and what kind of control 
there is of their family members, so they can kill them. It is a 
question of predominance: They have to show that they are 
stronger than we are. As for the informers, it is about time a 
code of professional ethics were passed for the magistrates, 
which would establish the regulations of the relationships with 
the state's witnesses and would determine the scheduling and 
format of the confessions. 
  [Milella] Elections are approaching. Should we be expecting 
demonstrations like the bombings in May and July? 
  [Violante] Nothing can be excluded by anyone. The 5 April 
1992 elections were preceded by the assassination of Salvo Lima 
and followed by the massacres of Capaci and Via D'Amelio. It is 
likely that the strikes of obstruction will take place before 
Parliament is dissolved and after the elections, like in 1992. 
We have the means to prevent the attacks, but some cannot be 
avoided. 
<H5>  [Box, p 29] </H5>
<H5>  Embargo </H5>
  "We are still lagging behind in the hunt for Mafia money. A 
meaningful comparison would be to say that today on the 
financial front in the fight against crime we find ourselves in 
the same situation in which we were at the end of the 1970's 
with regard to the criminal front." In 1994, Luciano Violante's 
principle objective and the one on which he will be 
concentrating all his energies, is the battle to stop the dirty 
money of the Cosa Nostra and the other criminal organizations. 
  The president of the Anti-Mafia Commission explains: "Back 
then, we followed the individual crimes committed by the Mafia, 
and we did not attack the organization as such. The big 
difference with judges like Rocco Chinnici, Gaetano Costa, 
Giovanni Falcone, and Paolo Borsellino was precisely that they 
went from concentrating on the individual responsibilities for 
the murders to attacking the Mafia organization in and of itself 
as a crime in order to then discover the ones who were really 
guilty of the assassinations. On the financial front, this 
change has not yet taken place. Today, we are following the 
individual cases of money laundering--with positive results 
statistically--but we are not yet in a position to attack the 
complex organization of money laundering. The result is that 
single channels of money laundering are discovered while all the 
rest continues." 
  What is Violante's proposal? "There should be at least one 
magistrate in each district attorney general's office to handle 
Mafia finances. We also need to review the laws controlling 
criminal assets, because the present ones are totally 
inadequate. Only 7 percent of the assets seized are confiscated 
and 11 percent are given back. All the rest remains blocked. 
Then we need to periodically hold joint meetings of the special 
police forces (DIA [Anti-Mafia Investigative Directorate], ROS 
[Special Operations Section], SCO [Central Operations Service], 
and GICO [Organized Crime Investigative Group]) and the ordinary 
police, who handle financial matters--but without getting into 
our heads the idea that we need another specialized 
organization. Finally, international collaboration is 
indispensable, because a problem like money laundering cannot be 
confronted on the level of a single country. In the future, some 
forms of embargo will have to be considered for countries and 
banks that welcome Mafia funds."

<F P=106> [Maria Joao Rocha report: "PSP and Platform in Harmony"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Antonio Guterres, Jose Lamego, Jorge Lacao, and 
Jorge Coelho received Barros Moura, Pina Moura, and Raimundo 
Narciso at the Largo do Rato [Socialist party headquarters] 
yesterday. The aim of the the meeting between the Socialists 
and the Left-Wing Platform was to extend political cooperation 
to the main PSP [Portuguese Socialist Party] initiatives and 
challenges. 
  It was also the first in a series of meetings following the 
local elections. The meetings will culminate in a new agreement 
protocol for the European elections, to be signed probably 
within two months. 
  Barros Moura reaffirmed his willingness to be an independent 
candidate on the PSP lists, a euphemistic way of confirming his 
presence in an eligible position. The matter is uncontentious. 
  It is more difficult for [PSP Secretary General] Antonio 
Guterres to succeed in placing all the available candidates in 
the first 10 places on the list. The placements are being left 
until after the congress. 
  At the end of yesterday's meeting, Barros Moura and Guterres 
were in perfect harmony on the philosophy of the States General 
for a new majority. 
  "It is not a left-wing majority. It has been proved that it 
is not sufficient to combine the left-wing votes in order to 
defeat the PSD [Social Democratic Party]," the Platform leader 
asserted. The PSP leader did not improve on that. 
<H5>  Differences Between Congress and States General </H5>
  Guterres does not seem to be losing any sleep over the 
"Portugal: What Future?" congress, promoted by the president of 
the republic, being now more concerned about the convention and 
the placements on the list for the European Parliament. 
  The PSP secretary general asserts that the congress and the 
"States General for a new majority" are initiatives of a 
different nature made at different times. 
  The holding of the "Portugal: What Future?" congress in May 
could undermine one of the actions which the Socialists had 
planned in order to create a political dynamic following the 
European elections; that is, at the decisive starting point for 
the parliamentary elections. 
  The timing would not be the only disruptive element. Mario 
Soares' stance in favor of a rapprochement between the PSP and 
the PCP [Portuguese Communist Party] in a left-wing front in 
order to defeat the PSD is well known. 
  During the congress, the matter will still be on the agenda, 
and this will force Antonio Guterres to dot the i's and cross 
the t's. 
  Yesterday, the PSP leader reaffirmed that the party will 
"discuss its own government blueprint as widely as possible. 
Hence to form an alliance with the PCP would be to cheat the 
electorate." These are statements which he will certainly have 
to reaffirm until May. 
  The Socialist leader declined to comment on the presidential 
initiative's intentions, deemed it an important event involving 
civil society, but explained that "our concern is not just to 
unite the left; it is to find a coherent political majority for 
the country." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Pau Barquero and Isidre Ambros report: "Gonzalez Does Not </F>
Believe Debate on His Replacement as Candidate Is Open"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said 
in Brussels yesterday that he does not believe the PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] is debating about on his replacement is 
open, and stated that nobody in the party has openly raised this 
issue with him. He admitted that he once raised the possibility 
of his own retirement, and that that was a mistake which 
subsequently fueled the internal crisis in the party. 
  Felipe Gonzalez also stated that at the next PSOE congress, 
if he has the confidence of the delegates and it depends on him, 
Alfonso Guerra will figure in the new party leadership. In a 
conversation with journalists, Gonzalez admitted that the 
precongress debate in the PSOE has become heated, and that he is 
trying to stay neutral in the process of selecting delegates. 
He described as liars those who could have said he is opposed 
to Guerra's presence in the new leadership that will emerge from 
the congress, and emphasized his belief that Alfonso Guerra can 
remain a perfect PSOE deputy secretary general. [passage 
omitted] 
  On a possible coalition government following the Socialist 
congress, Gonzalez said there is cooperation with CiU 
[Convergence and Union], which makes it possible to govern and 
to adopt measures as important as the labor reform. He repeated 
his offer of a coalition government, and said he is open to 
dialogue if CiU were to accept the offer. He admitted, however, 
that communication with the Basque Nationalist Party would be 
much more difficult now, although he declined to give an 
explanation of what he believes to be the cause of the Basque 
Nationalists' change of attitude. Gonzalez did rule out a grand 
coalition government with the People's Party, because he 
believes the conditions for it do not exist. 
  Nor did he show himself in favor of holding an early 
election, although the latest opinion polls to be published show 
an increase for the People's Party. He recalled that something 
similar occurred last May, but the PSOE then won the election. 
With respect to the People's Party, Gonzalez admitted meeting 
recently with Jose Maria Aznar to discuss the situation in 
Banesto [company in financial crisis] and the NATO summit. He 
expressed his desire to continue to hold these personal 
contacts, although he admitted there have only been two in the 
course of the parliamentary term. 
  Gonzalez also denied that he lives shut up in Moncloa Palace 
and has no contact with people, although he acknowledged that he 
could be giving the false impression of living isolated from the 
country's real problems. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister also criticized the attitude of the trade 
unions to calling a general strike for 27 January. In the 
opinion of Felipe Gonzalez, this is a totally inopportune act 
of irresponsibility, since it will not help to create jobs or to 
boost investors' confidence, and he repeated that it is bad for 
the already difficult economic situation suffered by Spain. The 
Spanish head of government also showed moderate optimism about 
an early emergence from the crisis, in view of the improvement 
in the latest economic indicators. However, he forecast a slow 
recovery which would have no immediate impact on job creation.

  [Text] Bilbao (Spain), 13 Jan (EFE) -- The extremist group 
Iraultza (Revolution, in the Basque language), has claimed 
responsibility for an attack yesterday on the Mexican Consulate 
in Bilbao, in the northern Basque country. There were no 
victims or substantial property damage. 
  Iraultza, an extremist group not linked to ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty Orgainzation] and which usually attacks 
state organizations, claimed responsibility for the attack in a 
call to the newspaper EGIN, the traditional mouthpiece of this 
terrorist band. 
  An official spokesman said that only the bomb's "primer," 
which was homemade and had been placed at the Consulate's 
entrance, exploded. 
  According to Vice Consul Jose Miguel Arechavala, nine days 
ago a telephone call was made to the Consulate. The caller said 
he was calling on behalf of Iraultza. He threatened to plant a 
bomb to protest the Mexican Government's action in the armed 
conflict in Chiapas State. 
  In recent days, demonstrations and rallies have been 
organized in several places of Spain to protest the actions of 
the Mexican Army in the insurrection of peasants and Indians in 
Chiapas.

secretary; and Ertugrul Atakan, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy 
director general of Cypriot and Greek affairs; today visited 
Prime Minister Atun; Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy 
prime minister; and Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and 
defense minister. 
  In a speech during his meeting with the Turkish delegation, 
Prime Minister Atun said the coalition government views the 
Cyprus problem as the priority issue before it. However, he 
said, we are determined to defend the rights of the people 
vigorously while tackling the issue. 
  Tugay Ulucevik briefed the prime minister on Turkey's role 
and attitude in the current stage of the Cyprus problem. 
Ulucevik pointed out that there was a slowdown in efforts to 
reach a solution to the problem due to the early general 
elections. He said the international community expects the 
Cyprus problem to be tackled now that the new government 
received a vote of confidence, adding that the 
confidence-building measures are now on the agenda. As always, 
he stressed, Turkey wants the decision to be reached in Cyprus. 
The Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot people will make their 
own decisions regarding this issue, he added. 
  Ulucevik stated that for a decision to be reached, the 
method 
of free negotiations is essential. That is what Turkey 
believes, he said. 
  Ulucevik pointed out that even though it is up to the 
Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus to decide on the confidence-building 
measures, in principle, Turkey has always looked positively at 
the idea that the two communities should take 
confidence-building measures. In principle, he added, Turkey 
supports this issue. 
  Ulucevik said that in the coming days, the search for a 
solution will focus on this issue between the two communities. 
Naturally, the decision will be made by the Turkish Cypriot 
Government, he said. 
  Speaking at his meeting with Ulucevik and Atakan, Ozker 
Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister, said he has 
always been in favor of a solution of the Cyprus problem, which 
has been going on for the past 30 years. The world expects this 
problem to be resolved, he said. 
  Ozgur pointed out that he shares Ulucevik's views on the 
Cyprus problem. He said: The coalition government has a 
positive approach to the solution of the Cyprus problem as soon 
as possible. There is a confidence crisis between the two 
communities created during the past 30 years. The coalition 
government will do all it can to eliminate this. Our government 
wants an acceptable solution.

  [Text] This evening, the Greek Cypriots added another 
border violation to those they have been carrying out for some 
time. TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency] reports that 10 shots 
were fired from two different places in the Greek Cypriot 
sector, some 150 meters into the border near the Lokmaci 
barricades in Lefkosa [Nicosia]. This provocative act occurred 
at around 1930. The Turkish Cypriot side did not respond in 
kind, so there were no casualties or damage to property. The 
Turkish Cypriot authorities have protested the incident to 
UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus].

  [Text] Ankara, Jan 13 (AA) -- Georgian President and 
Parliament Speaker Eduard Shevardnadze said on Thursday [13 
January] that Georgia would be happy to see Turkish officials 
among the United Nations observers that will be sent to Abkhazia. 
  Shevardnadze told a press conference arranged at the end of 
his official visit to Turkey that the visit was the beginning of 
a new stage for the two countries' relations. 
  He said the legal basis of the bilateral relations was 
completed between Turkey and Georgia with the signature of 
agreements adding that these two countries shared the same 
opinion on regional issues. 
  He said a meeting with President Suleyman Demirel (whom he 
called an "experienced statesman") was very beneficial. 
  Shevardnadze said Turkey and Georgia shared the views that 
the problems should be solved in a peaceful way adding that the 
same view was relevant for Abkhazia. 
  He said he hoped the UN- mediated talks in Geneva for the 
solution of the Abkhazian problem would end positively. 
  Answering a question, Shevardnadze said "the biggest problem 
is the return of the refugees. Some 250,000 Georgians have fled 
from Abkhazia. They are left homeless, hungry. If their 
security is achieved, peace can be possible with Abkhazia." 
  Asked if they wanted support from Turkey on the Abkhazia 
problem, he said Turkey already joined in the problem. 
  Turkey earlier extended credit to Georgia and said Georgia's 
territorial integrity should be preserved. 
  Shevardnadze said during the talks that Turkey and Georgia 
discussed the improvement of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
[BSEC] Project adding that the BSEC would contribute to the 
peace, stability and economic development of the region being a 
bridge between the European Union and the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  He said the BSEC should have a crisis-solving function 
adding 
that the issue will be discussed in a summit with the heads of 
governments and heads of states in Tbilisi in May or June. 
  He said he invited Demirel, Premier Tansu Ciller and 
Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk to Georgia. 
  Shevardnadze said they work on an "Asian-European corridor" 
project including petroleum and natural gas pipelines, highways, 
railways, telecommunication networks and airways that will pass 
from Turkey and Georgia. 
  He said Georgia will cooperate with NATO on the "partnership 
for peace" project and open a military representation in NATO's 
center.

<F P=106> [Inci Tanriover video report from New York] </F>
  [Text] In New York, Murat Karayalcin, state minister and 
deputy prime minister, issued the message that the struggle 
against terrorism will continue. Karayalcin explained that 
terrorism cannot be surmounted solely through measures to be 
adopted within Turkey and that certain measures must also be 
introduced outside the country. 
  In a news conference at the end of his contacts in New York, 
Karayalcin replied to questions, explaining that there is no 
water problem between Turkey and Syria. This issue is being 
exaggerated by foreign sources, he said. 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] It is not appropriate to weigh 
the water and terrorism issues together. This is not compatible 
with goodneighborly relations. Turkey has never considered 
depriving its neighboring countries of water. If, however, 
someone tries to link water with terrorism, then we will give 
them the necessary response. [end recording] 
  Karayalcin noted that it cannot be said that Turkey has 
brought its relations with all its neighbors to the necessary 
level on the subject of fighting terrorism. He expressed the 
hope, nevertheless, that the decisions adopted by certain 
countries against the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
organization will yield fruit. 
  In reply to a question, Karayalcin expressed the view that 
the local elections to be held on 27 March are historically 
important. The developments concerning the candidates clearly 
demonstrate this, Karayalcin declared, adding that deputies are 
submitted as mayoral candidates for the first time in Turkey's 
political history. 
  Karayalcin also attended the dinner hosted by the Federation 
of Turkish-U.S. Associations, where he delivered a speech. In 
his speech, the deputy prime minister recounted that Turkey and 
the United States fought shoulder to shoulder during the Korean 
War, the Cold War, and the Gulf war and established a strong 
relationship. Karayalcin said that today, too, the two countries 
are determined to pursue a close partnership in the defense and 
security, economic and commercial, as well as cultural and 
social fields. 
  Karayalcin will proceed to Washington today. He will hold a 
meeting with U.S. Vice President Al Gore later in the evening.

<F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by </F>
Pierre Lefevre; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Lefevre] Do you think there is a military solution 
to the Kurdish problem in Turkey? 
  [Ciller] There is no military solution. There is a solution 
which must come from implementation of the law. We are doing 
nothing you would not do in your country. People are being 
massacred in Turkey. The PKK [Workers' Party of Kurdistan] is a 
separatist group that must be distinguished from the Kurdish 
population. They live throughout Turkey, not only in Anatolia 
in the southeast. 
  We have 25 very mixed ethnic groups throughout the country. 
But the PKK separatists are killing the Kurds themselves. That 
is why that population is afraid and supports them. The law 
must protect that population where it is. The Kurds and the 
Turks coexist in the Army and in Parliament; they make laws 
together and implement them together against that separatist 
group. 
  [Lefevre] Last March, the PKK proposed a cease-fire. Why did 
the Turkish Government not seize that opportunity and seek a 
political solution, as the British Government is doing with the 
IRA? 
  [Ciller] What is a political solution? Does it mean 
abandoning part of your country? You do not have the right to 
do that. People live there and do not want their house, their 
land to be abandoned to uncertainty. As for the cease-fire 
demanded by the PKK, it was exactly what we thought: A means of 
temporarily withdrawing to recover and secure logistical aid. 
Toward May or early June, they relaunched their massacres on 
all sides. We knew that would happen. 
  [Lefevre] Do you not think that applying the CSCE principles 
relating to minorities to the Kurdish population could make it 
easier to find a political solution? 
  [Ciller] We do not have a minority. Turkey is a mixture of 
25 ethnic groups. We do not have second-class citizens, or 
minorities, or first-class citizens. What do you Belgians want? 
You want to be able to travel where you wish, speak your 
language, be a voter, become a minister, carry on the business 
you wish. Everybody can do that in my country. If that was 
what the PKK wanted, there would be a solution. 
  [Lefevre] Why are radio broadcasts in Kurdish banned in 
Turkey? 
  [Ciller] We do not even have a framework law governing radio 
or television broadcasts. We have more stations than you have 
here in Europe. 
  [Lefevre] Are you saying that these broadcasts in Kurdish 
are 
banned for technical rather than political reasons? 
  [Ciller] What I am saying is that we have in Turkey all the 
freedoms which you in Europe do not have and do not give the 
Turks who work here. You massacre our workers. Did you know 
that? 
  When you ask that question you should ask why you do not 
defend human rights and a political solution for the Turkish 
workers in Europe. You should not have double standards. 
  We are much more consistent. We resisted the aggression in 
Armenia, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Kuwait, and we still have 
soldiers in Somalia. It is Europe which has double standards, 
which has fundamentalism. It is time it looked at itself. 
  [Lefevre] You have just met with the Belgian prime minister. 
What do you think of his refusal to ban the PKK in Belgium? 
  [Ciller] The PKK is a terrorist group. It is not Turkey's 
problem if it is able to operate in Belgium. It will disturb 
law and order at the expense of Belgian citizens and remain 
there for a long time. It is involved in the trafficking of 
drugs and arms. And you will have all that in Belgium. It is 
not what Turkey wants, but I am simply pointing out the problems 
which will arise in your country. The prime minister has 
expressed his concern in this regard. He said that he would 
monitor it closely and that the Belgian Government would take 
the necessary measures. 
  [Lefevre] What is your answer to the Belgian interior 
minister who noted the presence of "gray wolves," the extreme 
right-wing Turkish nationalists, during incidents on 1 and 2 
January in Brussels, and that of members of the Turkish 
diplomatic services? 
  [Ciller] We clearly do not support that. This is the first 
time that such incidents have occurred in Belgium, although 
Turkish workers have lived here for years. It is due to the 
fact that that action was so unjust. It is due to the fact that 
the PKK is a terrorist group which kills without legitimacy. 
The Turks living here simply reacted against that. 
  [Lefevre] Your country borders on the former USSR. What do 
you think of the Russians' attitude in what they call their 
"immediate neighborhood?" 
  [Ciller] We support the development of the reforms in 
Russia. 
When I was in Russia a few months ago, I told Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin and President Yeltsin that Turkey is in favor of 
cooperation, not competition, in the regions which have become 
independent countries. 
  We want to take action with Russia, and to support the 
reforms and democratization. But, on the other hand, we cannot 
fail to see that there is a resurgence of nationalism and ethnic 
conflicts in that part of the world. We have the feeling that 
this resurgence of nationalism has the support of the 
population, whatever President Yeltsin has in mind. This 
nationalism does not necessarily mean a desire to return to 
Communism. Instead they want stability, security, the good old 
days, they expect too much too soon from the changes under way 
and they are not getting it. That is why there is a reaction. 
  What we must do is support the reforms, but also assess the 
risks. 
  [Lefevre] Do you think that there is an expansionist threat 
from the Russians? 
  [Ciller] They want bilateral military agreements with all 
the 
countries of the Community of Independent States. Azerbaijan is 
the latest. They say they want to protect Azerbaijan by a 
bilateral military agreement and they want to do so alone. 
  Against whom? Against the allies? Against Turkey or against 
what? Why just a military agreement? Why not a mutual 
agreement which would also include Europe as observer to monitor 
Armenian aggression? This is not the right attitude. 
  [Lefevre] You are due to meet with Mr. Delors and Mr. 
Brittan 
at the European Commission. What will you tell them about 
Cyprus? 
  [Ciller] That we want a solution in Cyprus, that we have 
everything to gain from a solution. The two communities must 
sit down and talk. We support measures to restore confidence 
and anything which could contribute to a lasting solution. The 
only problem is to know whether the Greeks will have the same 
attitude. Contrary to what is customarily done, I did not use 
the Greek question for internal political ends during my 
election campaign and so far I have not responded to all the 
aggressive statements coming from the Greek side. A 
good-neighborly attitude is much more constructive. 
  By contrast, the Cyprus question was used in Greece in 
Papandreou's campaign and in recent months. But I am still 
hopeful. Although we are not directly involved in the 
negotiations, we will give all the support we can to reach a 
feasible and lasting situation. 
  [Lefevre] Are you on the point of normalizing your relations 
with Iraq? 
  [Ciller] We were the first to oppose the invasion of Kuwait. 
The oil pipeline which we constructed with Iraq is still closed. 
Nobody has suffered as much as us from the embargo. But it is 
time to reexamine the embargo question in the light of what we 
want to obtain. Turkey will not act alone. We want to continue 
to cooperate with our allies and examine with them where the 
embargo leads. If the aim is to remove Saddam Husayn, it will 
not work. 
  He is increasing in popularity in his country and throughout 
the Near East and it is the population which is suffering as a 
result of the embargo. It is not producing the effects for 
which it was established.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`We Have Even Got a Seat in Kohl's </F>
Anteroom'"] 
  [Text] Aleksey Vedenkin, the "number two" behind 
Zhirinovskiy, was deputy security chief at the Central Committee 
building until the 1991 putsch, when he went over to the Russian 
ultranationalists. The 30-year-old boasts that "all the secrets 
in the world passed through my hands. I know exactly who 
transferred what sums abroad and, of course, where those sums 
are now." 
  In describing the scale of the financial transactions, 
Vedenkin draws a drastic, if not historically inaccurate, 
comparison. "The Rockefellers needed 300 years to become rich, 
the KGB and CPSU mafias achieved the same result in six months. 
Their days are over, however. Most of the old cadres are now 
counting on us. They will help us to expose the mafia." It is 
being continually said that Zhirinovskiy himself is being 
promoted by the KGB. 
  However, the "Europe spokesman" not only claims to know 
everything about those transaction involving billions, he claims 
to know other secrets. So, in passing, he mentioned something 
that would amount to a political bombshell if it were correct: 
Vedenkin said -- and this was recorded by NEWS -- "Zhirinovskiy 
and I know that one of our men has been sitting in the German 
chancellor's office for years. The Kohl man previously worked 
for the KGB, but he now has gone over to our side. He is 
supplying us will all kinds of information. Kohl does not have 
a clue about it."

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Bundestag in </F>
Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, the Brussels summit confirmed 
that NATO will remain the cornerstone of future security for the 
whole of undivided Europe. The alliance reconfirmed its 
traditional function -- safeguarding the territorial integrity 
of all members. The aim, point, and objective of NATO have once 
again proven themselves indispensable and irreplaceable. 
[applause] 
  At the same time, the alliance defined clear cut objectives 
for the future. In doing so, it is continuing its process of 
change and strengthening its ability to act. Who would have 
believed the role NATO would be given with the disappearance of 
the bipolar world, following its original task as a collective 
defense system against the East. Conflict scenarios have been 
replaced today by strategies for cooperation, and that is to be 
welcomed. [applause] 
  This means NATO is moving into a new epoch in which security 
is having to be considered in a wider sense. Widened in 
geographic terms, as the summit decided in principle, widened in 
functional terms by early warning and conflict prevention, 
widened in conceptual terms by early warning and conflict 
prevention, and by means of economic, ecological, social, and 
cultural components, because security can only decreasingly be 
guaranteed by military means alone. [applause] 
  The NATO summit decided on the evolutionary concept of a 
gradual, organic expansion of the alliance. I have supported 
and suggested this concept of a differentiated, multilayered 
interlocking with the East from the beginning, and the former 
Warsaw Pact countries are pushing powerfully into our alliance. 
What greater change can there be in this world than that those, 
who just a short while ago were, so to speak, our arch enemies, 
now want to meet their security needs by entering our Western 
alliance, NATO. [applause] 
  The summit showed the path toward membership for these 
countries. We must now, however, move along it patiently but 
with purpose and determination. The alliance is thus 
consistently pursuing the course begun in 1991. At that time, 
on a German-U.S. initiative, we began with the founding of the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council to open the door to 
cooperation with the Eastern neighbors. The Partnership for 
Peace supplements the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and 
widens the range of concrete cooperation. Without 
discrimination, it opens up further opportunities for 
differentiated interlocking relations. 
  The German Government has always taken very seriously the 
worries and expectations of our eastern neighbors and partners. 
We understand their warnings about a gray zone and their 
concern about isolation. However, the answer cannot and must 
not be to divide Europe again between black and white. Germany 
sees itself, and I adhere to this image, as the advocate of the 
interests of our neighbors to the East, and we do not merely say 
that, Herr Klose, but we act in accordance with it, in all 
areas. [applause] 
  The reforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe know 
they can depend on us in a special way. They also turn to us in 
a quite definite way but also Russia, Ukraine, and the other 
countries come to us and say: You will take special care that we 
do not become isolated, pushed away. We need a balanced 
solution, and we found that at the NATO summit in Brussels. 
[applause] 
  [Parliamentary Speaker Rita Suessmuth] Mr. Kinkel, would you 
permit a question from Deputy (Seifert)? 
  [Kinkel] Yes. 
  [Seifert] Foreign Minister, could you tell me why you are 
channeling so much effort into realizing your strategies for 
cooperation through a military alliance and not through the 
CSCE, which is already in existence and which was set up 
expressly as a body for cooperation? 
  [Kinkel] Who says we are not also trying to do this through 
the CSCE? The new European security architecture we have to 
build is, of course, linked to NATO, the CSCE, the NATO 
Cooperation Council of the WEU [Western European Union], and the 
European Union in both political and economic spheres. And it 
is precisely this which we are trying to bring about. The CSCE 
is playing a decisive role in the interlinking architecture that 
we want to and have to find, a point to which I shall return. 
So, the CSCE is not being neglected. [applause] 
  On the other hand, it is the case that no third state has 
ever been able to claim a right of veto with respect to alliance 
membership, and this is how it has to stay. But we should not 
create any new grounds for antagonism or any new rifts. 
  At the same time, however, it is true that in the end the 
best security guarantee for Europe lies in a stable, democratic, 
economically efficient, and cooperative Russia. Russia has 
taken decisive steps toward this objective, thanks not least to 
our massive political and economic support. It is on the 
historically unique path from a planned to a market economy, 
from Communism toward democracy. And it would be naive, really 
naive not to expect setbacks, mistakes, erroneous paths being 
taken by extremist, nationalist policies, as well as problems of 
economic policy. Nevertheless, we shall not allow Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy to talk us into any new hostile images [applause], 
quite simply because we want partnership, not hostility. I 
remain confident, very confident actually, that the majority of 
the Russian population thinks exactly the same way. We cannot 
say no to Russia as long as Russia says yes to Europe. 
  At least it was right, and I adhere to this view, to deny 
Mr. Zhirinovskiy an entry visa to Germany for his 18-day 
political show, a propaganda tour, the direction of which one 
could predict. [applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, it is just as important that countries 
such as Ukraine, the Baltic republics, and the countries of 
southeastern Europe should not get the impression that the door 
to the expansion of Western structures of stability will open 
only once, and just for a few, only to close again all the more 
firmly afterward. No, our guiding principle is a unified Europe 
in which no new chasms are created. [applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, a certain impression arose at the 
summit as if NATO expansion, relations with the East, were the 
only topics. That was not the case. The great tasks lying ahead 
for German security policy in Europe were also discussed at the 
NATO summit in Brussels. First, the NATO summit gave an 
impressive commitment to the European security and defense 
identity. The U.S. President supports the efforts for more 
European independence in the fulfillment of our European 
security interests. The opportunities for action by the WEU 
were considerably broadened, and some NATO resources were placed 
at its disposal. The European pillar is being strengthened, but 
it must remain placed firmly against the Atlantic pillar. If 
the European Union takes on additional competences on issues 
relating to politics and security, there must be deepened 
transatlantic consultation and coordination mechanisms, and the 
Atlantic must not be allowed to widen. [applause] 
  The United States of America has made a strong avowal of 
lasting commitment to Europe. We welcome, in particular, the 
declaration by the U.S. President that in future hundreds of 
thousands of soldiers will be left in Europe. This is of 
extrordinary significance for us and our European allies. 
  Now I come to what Herr Klose was urging this morning: 
Second, the opening of markets, intensification of trade and 
economic relations, in addition to cultural exchange are also 
elements of security. And the prospects of NATO expansion that 
have now opened up must be seen in the context of these other 
prospects of interlinking and expansion for the European Union. 
Both the prospects are interlinked and interconnected. A 
Europe that left its security up to NATO alone will remain 
incomplete. But at the same time, a European Union without the 
same security for all members is inconceivable. [applause] 
  Third, my French colleague [Alain] Juppe and I proposed that 
those countries with the prospect of joining the European Union 
should be brought closer to the WEU now, giving them additional 
anchorage and interlinking in terms of security policy, and I 
will emphatically press the WEU, as I have already done, to 
implement this proposal. [applause] 
  Fourth, the CSCE has long since made the concept of expanded 
security its own. It links military aspects of security with 
questions of human rights, democratic checks on power, and 
economic cooperation. It is to the CSCE's lasting credit that 
the huge political and military change in Europe was able to 
take place without the serious threat of military confrontation 
between the former blocs. We Germans of all people wish to 
retain the idea of the renunciation of violence, understanding, 
and the willingness to compromise. 
  And this applies particularly with regard to former 
Yugoslavia. The situation in former Yugoslavia figured largely 
at the summit, and in some respects overshadowed the talks a 
little. Our ability to help and mediate is not inexhaustible. 
The willingness to help is also declining tangibly among those 
countries that have contributed troops, with all the 
incalculable consequences, by the way, for the supply of 
humanitarian aid that would then no longer reach those in need 
if there actually were a withdrawal of the soldiers on the 
ground. 
  The signal coming from the summit, that reaffirmed its 
willingness to mount possible air strikes, is also an expression 
of growing impatience and disappointment. Nevertheless, the 
European plan of action, that is still based on the 
Franco-German initiative, remains urgently necessary. The 
signal from the summit, I have to repeat, was also that a 
certain turning point has been reached regarding the situation 
in former Yugoslavia. It might be difficult to remain confident 
on this issue, but peace is too important for us to give up 
hope. However -- and this is something I stressed clearly to 
Izetbegovic and Tudjman during the Petersberg talks -- peace 
will only be possible if the warring parties want it and work to 
make it happen. [applause] We give thanks to all those who are 
helping, even to the extent of laying down their lives, to 
prevent the dreadful violations of human rights, or at least are 
trying to alleviate them. 
  Fifth, the offer of a peace partnership is aimed beyond the 
range of the members of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, 
but also at other CSCE members. I have already advocated the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council opening up in principle to 
all CSCE members. This will give the CSCE process greater 
substance and effectiveness. The North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council and thus, also NATO, are being given new options for 
prevention of conflicts, crisis management, and peace missions. 
The CSCE summit in Budapest this year must further develop the 
scope of action of the CSCE and its interlinking with the United 
Nations and NATO. 
  Sixth, NATO declares its readiness to support peacekeeping 
measures and other missions by the CSCE and the United Nations. 
In this way the alliance is affirming the unique responsibility 
of the United Nations for international peace order. That means 
for us that we also must be prepared to take part in these 
alliance tasks. If we do not wish to isolate ourselves here, 
then we urgently need a clarification of the constitutional 
issues. [applause] I will repeat my appeal to you, ladies and 
gentlemen of the opposition, to shoulder your share of the 
responsibility -- give up your blockade of a constitutional 
amendment! [applause] Our country is being damaged. During the 
Brussels summit, the chancellor and I were on several occasions 
-- and I add this to the appeal -- in a very, very difficult 
situation, in a situation that is sometimes beneath the dignity 
of a country that is now the largest at the heart of Europe and 
that has additional responsibilities. I can only reiterate: In 
the interests of this country, we will not put up with this 
situation for very much longer. Give up your blockade! 
  Seven, with great emphasis the heads of government in 
Brussels declared the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction as a danger for international security. The members 
of the UN Security Council had already made it clear at their 
summit meeting two years ago that a legitimate concern, a very, 
very important concern of the community of nations, was to 
control and stem weapons of mass destruction and their carrier 
systems. Germany is the only country to have voluntarily and 
permanently renounced weapons of mass destruction. At the 
beginning of December, I already formulated my proposals in a 
10-point plan to strengthen the policy of the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons. We will energetically pursue this 
initiative. Our aim is to prevent new nuclear weapons states 
from coming into being in the world by means of timely, active 
cooperation with the countries in question. [applause] 
  Nine [as heard], Ladies and Gentlemen, an agreement to 
regulate the elimination of the former Soviet nuclear weapons 
based in Ukraine is scheduled to be concluded tomorrow. The 
Federal Government made a decisive contribution to this 
breakthrough by means of intensive dialogue with Kiev on 
security and disarmament questions. And we hope that this 
agreement finds sufficient internal political support in 
Ukraine. For then, the path will be free for Ukraine membership 
in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state. 
This will increase the chances for an unlimited and 
unconditional extension of this treaty. Then intensive and 
comprehensive cooperation with this hugely important state -- a 
particularly important country for Europe's security 
architecture -- could at last be concluded. 
  The cooperation agreement between the European Union and 
Ukraine must also be concluded. The difficult relationship 
between Ukraine and Russia should be eased by means of a treaty 
on good-neighborly relations and the renunciation of the use of 
force. We are prepared to help in this to the best of our 
ability, but as far as Ukraine is concerned, the European 
Community has undertaken a lot -- thank God -- because we must 
ensure that we carefully observe and watch what is going on in 
Ukraine, as we have done with the Central and Eastern European 
states, and particularly with Russia. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the result of the NATO summit fits 
smoothly into the concept of increased security for the whole of 
Europe. This concept arises from our interest in peace and 
stability in the whole of Europe. And we will continue to 
pursue this with determination. Clarity, conflict prevention, 
and confidence-building are the central issues. The last 45 
years have produced an exemplary network of stability through 
the European Community in Western Europe. Now it is important 
finally to connect the security network in the second half, so 
to speak, of the European Union process. We will have achieved 
our aim when old differences in the east of our continent are 
overcome by the strength of the European Union, to the same 
extent as this has been achieved in the West. We will have 
achieved our goal when the other states bordering on Europe, and 
this also includes our partner Russia, do not see this growing 
together of Europe as a threat, but as an advantage for their 
own security and prosperity. The road there is long but we want 
a foreign policy that goes beyond the present day. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, let me say one more thing in 
conclusion 
that occurred to me at the NATO summit and which I think is 
important for us: Our Bundeswehr enjoys enormous respect within 
the framework of NATO and in NATO. I think we should be proud 
of that. [applause] 
  It [the Bundeswehr] is and remains the guarantor of our 
security and an effective tool of our peace policy. Our 
alliance capacity depends on it, and I say that it needs secure 
planning, not only with regard to finance, but even more with 
regard to an unambiguous definition of its tasks. It cannot and 
must not be right for us to say that we have such-and-such an 
amount of money, we can afford such-and-such a size of 
Bundeswehr. It should be the other way round: We must say we 
need the Bundeswehr for such-and-such tasks, and the money 
needed for this must then be available. [applause] And we should 
be careful to keep the Bundeswehr, which is a very important 
part of our society, out of attempts at party political 
posturing -- this is a prime concern for me.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Pierre Prouteau, chairman of the </F>
Committee of French Investors in Black Africa and former 
minister, by Cristophe Urbanowicz; place and date not given: 
"Jean Pierre Prouteau: `It Will Cost 10 Billion Francs to 
French Companies'"] 
  [Text] The devaluation of the CFA franc could lead to the 
bankruptcy of 200 ailing French companies operating in Africa. 
At a minimum, it will cost all French companies operating in 
black Africa 10 billion French francs [Fr]. These are the 
estimates Jean-Pierre Prouteau put forward in an interview with 
LE QUOTIDIEN. 
  [Urbanowicz] Were you surprised by the devaluation of the 
CFA 
franc? Do you think it constitutes a turning point in 
French-African relations? 
  [Prouteau] It is a turning point, because it puts an end to 
the dogma of fixed monetary parity with the CFA zone. We have 
to accept this, but we are not pleased with the way it was 
implemented as it was ordered by the IMF and the World Bank. 
The IMF director is not the governor of the 15 African heads of 
state. I would call him an "off-shore [preceding word in 
English] governor:" He gives orders that have financial 
implications, but does not assume any political responsibility. 
  The role of the IMF and the World Bank cannot be assumed by 
anybody else, however, because there is nobody to do so and 
Europe is sleeping on both ears. The devaluation of the CFA 
franc is a bet on the future, and the CFA zone is being played 
heads or tails. Even with a 50-percent devaluation, can one be 
sure that inflation will not reach the same level within two 
years? The bet has not yet been won. 
  [Urbanowicz] What problems will arise from the devaluation? 
  [Prouteau] Let us begin with the positive effects: If the 
World Bank allocates $1 million to an African country today, 
this is the equivalent of CFA 580 million. Thus, the public 
accounts of these countries will be swamped. 
  Second, exports will bring in more in terms of CFA francs. 
However, the devaluation will make imports 50 percent more 
expensive; it will increase inflation; and it will be a burden 
on debt servicing. But I do not think that the IMF will 
compensaye for the effects of this devaluation on debts. 
  [Urbanowicz] What will be the financial consequences of the 
devaluation for French companies? How much will it cost French 
investors in Africa? 
  [Prouteau] France accounts for 60 to 75 percent of foreign 
investments in the CFA zone, and 70 percent of transactions 
(declared, paying customs duties, and taxes). Some 1,200 French 
groups and subsidiaries and 1,000 small companies operate in 
this area, representing sales of Fr100 billion. 
  According to our estimates, the devaluation will cost at 
least Fr10 billion to the companies of the Committee of French 
Investors in Black Africa (CIAN) alone, which for 70 years has 
been the employers' committee specializing in this area. The 
CIAN represents 80 groups and 1,200 subsidiaries. We have 
calculated that corporate assets depreciations will equal 50 
percent of the abovementioned Fr10 billion. I have to remind 
you that their headquarters are located there. 
  The second type of problem concerns linkage accounts 
[comptes 
de liaison] or current accounts, i.e., all outstanding orders 
abroad. For instance, if yesterday one of our [expatriate] 
companies placed an order worth Fr100 million, today it will 
have to pay double that amount [in CFA francs]. 
  In addition, African states often are one or two months 
behind on current orders; thus, companies which ordered products 
in French francs abroad will lose 50 percent. According to our 
estimates, these losses will amount to Fr5 billion at least. 
  Another problem concerns the 6,000 expatriates employed by 
CIAN companies. The French-franc value of their salaries will 
halve, which is quite serious considering that part of their 
salaries are spent in France, namely on house rents. French 
companies will have to make up for these wage losses. 
  I want to point out that these estimates do not involve the 
oil sector, which is far more important and constitutes a 
special case. 
  [Urbanowicz] What is your analysis with regard to the 
disinvestment process, primarily by French investors, which has 
been affecting the CFA zone for several years? 
  [Prouteau] In 1985, large French groups had 1,500 
subsidiaries in this area. Between 1985 and 1988, 15 percent, 
or 200 of these were closed. Since 1989, the wave of closures 
has stopped; 1,300 subsidiaries remain, including 1,200 in the 
CFA zone. 
  At present, 65 percent of these make profits while 10 
percent 
are in serious trouble. The devaluation of the CFA franc might 
lead to the closure of the latter 10 percent within one or two 
years. I want to insist, however, that there is no risk of all 
French interests deserting the area. We will have to digest 
this devaluation, which, in our opinion, is much too brutal.

  [Text] Ankara -- While the Greek stand toward Turkey 
prompted the National Defense Ministry and General Staff into 
action, Turkish warplanes are continuing flights over the Aegean 
Sea and in international airspace. While the deterrence 
operation against Greece is continuing with 28 F-16 and F-4 
aircraft, the warships and submarines are making shows of force. 
The flights and shows of force will continue until further 
orders. 
  Baki Tug, chairman of the Turkish Grand National Assembly 
National Defense Commission, and members of the commission were 
given a scheduled briefing at the General Staff the other day. 
The deputies asked questions on the existing tension with 
Greece. Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, was not 
present at the briefing, which was attended by General Teoman 
Erkan, under secretary at the National Defense Ministry, Gen. 
Ahmet Corekci, deputy chief of the General Staff, and a number 
of officers. 
  The deputies were briefed on Turkey's military strength. 
When asked about the extent of the Greek threat and the 
measures being taken against it, the General Staff officers 
enumerated the measures being taken. In accordance with these 
measures, Turkish warplanes have started deterrence flights over 
the Aegean Sea and in international airspace. Twenty-four F-16 
and F-4 aircraft are intermittently conducting flights, dubbed 
the "24 plus 4" plan by the General Staff, because four fully 
equipped standby F-16s will start support flights if the need 
arises. In addition, our warships and submarines sailed into 
the Aegean the previous day and started a show of force. 
  After the briefing at the General Staff, the following 
members of the Commission met Chief of the General Staff Dogan 
Gures at lunch: "Baki Tug, Ural Koklu, Mustafa Kacmaz, Hasan 
Basri Eler, Mustafa Dursun Yangin, Halil Ibrahim Artvinli, 
Tevfik Diker, Aydin Mirkelam, Muhtar Mahramli, Turgut Tekin, Ali 
Uzun, Huseyin Aksoy, Gurhan Celebican, Safa Giray, Faruk Saydam, 
Abuzer Tanriverdi, Cemal Sahin, Mukadder Basegmez, and Cevat 
Ayhan." 
  It was learned that Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures said 
that Papandreou, who has come to power in Greece, is an 
unreliable person, and added: "Greece is acting like an enemy. 
For that reason, we have to strengthen our Army. In addition 
to our aircraft, we are having a show of force in the Aegean 
with our surface and underwater forces. We have to show our 
strength to the enemy. We will show it. We will immediately 
retaliate if Greece attacks." 
  In stressing during the meeting that Turkey's dialogue with 
the neighboring states is not sound, Gures is reported to have 
said: "We know well who is supporting the PKK [Kurdish Workers 
Party]. The PKK is our internal problem, but they have support 
from the outside. We know their leaders are in Syria. We have 
contacts with Syria, but it appears that nothing will occur as 
regards his [PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan] hand over to us. Iran 
and Iraq do not appear to be Turkey's friends. Iraq constantly 
says it has not forgotten Turkey's position during the Iraqi 
war."

  [Excerpt] Hamburg, Germany, Jan 15 (AFP) -- Belgian 
General Francis Briquemont, outgoing commander of the United 
Nations Protection Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has criticized 
NATO's air raid threats in the war-torn republic. 
  Briquemont -- who will be replaced by British General 
Michael 
Rose on January 24 after asking to be relieved of his functions 
-- said in an interview to be published by the German weekly DER 
SPIEGEL Monday [17 January] that he was tired of hearing about 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's threats to carry out 
air raids against Serb positions. 
  Such raids would not solve the problem of surrounded and 
besieged cities like Sarajevo, he said, adding that continual 
threats of this nature would not make the warring parties any 
more willing to discuss peace. 
  In his interview, an excerpt of which was released Saturday, 
the UNPROFOR commander accused the West of lacking a clear 
strategy in Bosnia. 
  Too many different opinions have been expressed, too many 
resolutions have been adopted and there are not enough resources 
allocated to carry out policy, he said. 
  Briquemont said he feared that "the blue helmets will soon 
no 
longer be able to continue their humanitarian aid." 
  "It's an illusion to think UN troops can continue to supply 
humanitarian aid for an unlimited time if firing continues," he 
said. 
  If no peace agreement is reached soon the UN peacekeeping 
mission will have to be reassessed, he added. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Jan 16 (AFP) -- Urgent plans to bomb 
Serbian positions around the besieged Bosnian towns of 
Srebrenica and Tuzla will be studied by the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation here this week, a NATO source said at the 
weekend. 
  The plans, drawn up by UN commanders in Bosnia at the 
request 
of a NATO summit here last week, are due to be presented to UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in Geneva on Monday [17 
January], then sent to NATO headquarters here. [passage omitted] 
  They ordered UN field commanders in Bosnia urgently to draw 
up plans for such strikes, which can be launched only if 
commanders on the scene ask for them and if Butrus-Ghali agrees. 
  NATO military planners will review the plans here this week, 
and ambassadors from the alliance's 16 member nations are 
scheduled to discuss them on Wednesday, the NATO source said. 
[passage omitted] 
  The NATO source added: "We clearly need a process where the 
political will (to bomb) is built up in NATO. The credibility 
of the West and the international community is at stake. I hope 
governments recognise the stakes." [passage omitted] 
  The NATO source said: "The question is just how does the UN 
see air power -- just to protect UN troops or as a political 
weapon?" [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Geneva, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Islamic countries 
meeting here Monday [17 January] renewed a call for air strikes 
on Bosnia and issued a veiled threat of economic sanctions 
against countries backing a partition of the former Yugoslav 
republic. 
  Foreign ministers from the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference (OIC) "agree to continue to review their economic 
relations with those governments which continue to impede the 
achievement of a just settlement." 
  But they did not name the governments which they said 
blocked 
chances for peace by "legitimizing the fruits of aggression," a 
reference to a plan that would give Serbs land which they 
captured from the Moslem-led government. 
  "We've not really identified who this is targeted at," 
according to Pakistani Foreign Minister Assef Ahmed Ali, 
chairman of the eight-country OIC group handling the Bosnia 
crisis. 
  "It's just a statement of general principles," he said, 
adding the OIC would try to come up with a common position. 
  Nor did the ministers, meeting here on the eve of resumption 
of Bosnia peace talks, explain what they meant by "a review of 
economic relations." The OIC includes major oil exporters Saudi 
Arabia and Iran. 
  Each country can "read into it what it wishes," Ali said. 
  The OIC group issued their statement after talks with UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic ahead of new talks between the Bosnian factions 
which broke off in December. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Geneva, Jan 17 (AFP) -- A UN spokeswoman here 
denied Monday [17 that the commander of UN forces in former 
Yugoslavia, French General Jean Cot, is to be replaced. 
  A United Nations official in New York, who declined to be 
identified, had said earlier that Cot, in command of the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) since July 1, "will soon leave his 
position." But Therese Gastaut, spokeswoman here for UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, retorted: "That is not 
correct." 
  Asked straight out whether the secretary-general had 
dismissed Cot, she replied: "No." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Geneva, Jan 17 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali Monday [17 January] ordered plans drafted to 
free up two Serb-blocked areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina but gave no 
sign whether he would authorise NATO air strikes. 
  Butrus-Ghali had asked Yasushi Akashi, his special 
representative for the former Yugoslavia, to study the 
feasibility of using the air power offered by the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation at its summit last week. 
  The NATO leaders made the proposal as part of tougher action 
to relieve a contingent of Canadian UN troops trapped in the 
eastern enclave of Srebrenica and to reopen Tuzla airport in 
northeastern Bosnia to humanitarian flights. 
  Butrus-Ghali met with top aides here Monday on the NATO 
offer 
and asked Akashi to formulate a plan for the troop rotation in 
Srebrenica, which is under siege by the Serbs, UN spokeswoman 
Therese Gastaut said. 
  "A second plan is to be prepared with regard to the possible 
opening of Tuzla airport and the resources that are necessary to 
achieve this aim," she told reporters. 
  Gastaut sidestepped questions whether the operations would 
involve the use of NATO air power saying that the option was 
"part of a general discussion" and "that we will see when we get 
to it." 
  Also at the meeting here were UN peace envoy Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata and 
other top UN aides. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 18 (AFP) -- The UN secretary general's 
special representative for the former Yugoslavia has recommended 
against using NATO warplanes to free up two Serb-blocked areas 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a UN official said Tuesday [18 January]. 
  Yasushi Akashi delivered his assessment on a NATO proposal 
to 
use air power to relieve trapped Canadian UN troops in the 
eastern enclave of Srebrenica and to reopen Tuzla Airport in 
Bosnia's northeast. 
  The UN official, who asked not to be named, said Akashi gave 
his report Monday to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
who must authorise any air operations in Bosnia. 
  Informed sources said Akashi argued against using warplanes 
in Srebrenica since the Serbs had given their agreement in 
principle to the rotation of the Canadians and only technical 
points remained to be resolved. 
  Bosnian Serb strongman Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday his 
self-proclaimed "parliament" has decided to allow UN troops into 
Srebrenica to relieve UN soldiers trapped there for the last six 
months. 
  Diplomats in Geneva said the Serbs were wary of allowing the 
rotation to be used as a pretext for strenghtening the UN 
military presence in the besieged enclave. 
  Karadzic, cited by the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, said 
Dutch UN troops scheduled to replace the Canadians in Srebrenica 
would be allowed to go in "as of tomorrow" provided they were 
"the same number and with the same weapons." 
  However, he ruled out any reopening of the Tuzla airport. 
  Akashi said that the reopening of Tuzla airport, closed sice 
May 1992 by Serb shelling from the surrounding hills, was not 
worth the effort since land access to the city was often 
possible, the sources said. 
  They said Akashi further maintained that any air raids could 
unleash Serb reprisals against UN troops protecting relief 
operations in Bosnia. 
  Butrus-Ghali met Monday with Akashi and other top aides and 
ordered plans drafted to unblock Srebrenica and Tuzla Airport, a 
spokeswoman said. But she gave no sign whether he would 
authorise NATO air strikes. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit last week 
proposed using warplanes in Srebrenica and at Tuzla Airport 
after failing to agree on air strikes to end the siege of 
Sarajevo as it offered to do in August.

<F P=106> [Second of two-part "exclusive" interview with UN Secretary </F>
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by Franz-Olivier Giesbert, Jacques 
Jacquet-Francillon, and Charles Lambroschini; place and date not 
given: "Butrus-Ghali Denounces Bad Payers"] 
  [Text] [LE FIGARO] What are you most proud of since you 
took over the post of secretary general of the United Nations 
two years ago? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We were successful in Cambodia and in El 
Salvador. The fact that we could offer aid to millions of 
Somalis is also a success. There is no longer famine in 
Somalia. This is to the credit of the United Nations. We are 
also helping two million Yugoslavian refugees. Two million is 
nothing to sneeze at. We brought 360,000 refugees back to 
Cambodia. That is something. We successfully kept the peace in 
Mozambique, where we obtained major results. Elections are to 
be held on 27 April in South Africa. You might say: "You had 
nothing to do with that," but that is simply not true. We 
contributed a lot to this operation by sending observers there. 
We are going to send another 1,700 in the coming weeks. These 
are positive elements that you can see on the ground. 
  [LE FIGARO] Very well. So what was your big failure? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The thing I am least proud about is the fact 
that I have not managed to attract greater attention -- in the 
philosophic sense of the word -- from the member states as to 
the importance of the United Nations. The United Nations is a 
tool which they still hesitate to use. They say all the right 
things, and they make a lot of promises, but when the time comes 
to face up to reality, they hesitate.... 
  [LE FIGARO] Out of all the UN member states, how many do not 
pay their dues? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] At the end of last year, only 60 out of 184 
had paid their contribution to the ordinary budget. 
  [LE FIGARO] And the preceding years too? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It was even worse. 
  [LE FIGARO] What about the peacekeeping operations? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We must owe about $1.2 billion out of a total 
of $3.6 billion. 
  [LE FIGARO] Are there any bad payers on the Security 
Council? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Certainly, the United States and Russia. The 
United States is late, and Russia does not pay. This means that 
the good pupils, the ones who send us troops, are punished 
indirectly because we cannot pay them what we owe them for their 
contribution to the peacekeeping forces. 
  [LE FIGARO] You cannot reimburse France? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We reimburse France with a delay of one year. 
We reimburse Sweden with a delay of two years. I have received 
complaints from Tunisia, Egypt, Uruguay, and Jordan, all of whom 
want to withdraw their troops. Just yesterday morning, I 
received telegrams from two countries which have not received 
their contribution to the operations in Cambodia that ended last 
September. As a result, these two countries -- Tunisia and 
Bangladesh -- are refusing to send additional troops to Somalia. 
We are going to end up with insurmountable problems on our 
hands because of this financial crisis. 
  [LE FIGARO] One of the reforms of the UN Charter, which you 
mention often during your trips around the world, is the reform 
of the composition of the Security Council. This would 
essentially be a new allocation of permanent seats. How do you 
see things? How many new permanent members do you envisage? 
How would the veto right be allocated differently? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] First of all, this is a decision which, in 
accordance with Article 108 of the Charter, must be made by the 
General Assembly. I play no role in it. 
  [LE FIGARO] Really? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Following the initiative taken by the General 
Assembly, I sent a questionnaire to all the member states, to 
which I have received already some 70 replies. A consensus has 
emerged from these replies in favor of increasing the number of 
members on the Security Council, since when the United Nations 
was founded, it consisted of only 50 states, whereas it now has 
184. It has also been emphasized that the expansion of the 
Security Council must be limited so that it can continue to 
operate well. 
<H5>  General Relaxation </H5>
  [Butrus-Ghali continues] There is also emphasis on the fact 
that we should move quickly in order to take advantage of the 
celebration of the United Nations' 50th anniversary in 1995, and 
to carry out the reform. However, that is where the consensus 
ends. So we risk opening a Pandora's box, in that some 30 member 
states feel -- rightly or not -- that they deserve a permanent 
seat on the Security Council. From there we can indulge in 
academic exercises: We could envisage new permanent members 
which do not have the veto right, etc. 
  [LE FIGARO] The same names always come up: Germany and 
Japan. In order to have the rest of the world better 
represented, are there any other countries, like India, Brazil, 
Argentina, Nigeria, etc.? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I do not want to make any comment regarding 
any of these countries. I do not wish to create problems for 
myself. 
  [LE FIGARO] Surely India is pretty inevitable? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Everything depends on the vote, you know. 
There will be a political debate in the General Assembly, whose 
members are going to vote. However, do not forget that in the 
final analysis, we will still have to have the agreement of the 
five permanent members. Any revision of the Charter will only 
be valid after it has been ratified by the five permanent 
members of the Security Council -- all of whom have the veto 
right -- even if the resolution has been passed by a national 
assembly in which there is no veto right. 
  [LE FIGARO] So...? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] To my mind, what counts is not so much the 
reform, but the fact that via this reform I can attain greater 
participation by the most important member states in the role of 
the United Nations. 
  [LE FIGARO] So now we are coming back to your initial 
remarks. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, the lack of political will on the part 
of 
the large countries. 
  [LE FIGARO] The lack of leadership...American leadership. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No, I do not agree with you on that. American 
leadership used to be counterbalanced by another leadership. We 
had a bilateral system, bipolarism. Once one of the leaderships 
disappeared and collapsed, we emerged into a system which we 
cannot control. Nobody knows what has to be done anymore. The 
fact is that the very big member states are not up to their 
importance. Whether in Latin America or Asia, member states are 
not playing the role they should be playing -- a role they could 
afford to play if they had the political will to do so. 
  [LE FIGARO] In more general terms, do you mean that all the 
nations are less interested today than before in the affairs of 
the rest of the world? That everyone is withdrawing into their 
own problems? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, I repeat: There is a kind of laxness. 
  [LE FIGARO] How do you explain it? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The end of the Cold War created a general 
relaxation. We are confronted with new phenomena. 
  [LE FIGARO] With a confirmed political will and a clearer 
vision of what we could have done, do you think that we could 
have stopped the escalation of hostilities in Yugoslavia by 
intervening just after the first confrontations between Croats 
and Serbs? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It is very difficult to answer that question. 
A political will must not be expressed just at the beginning. 
It must be constant. That is the true lesson. The problem of 
peace is like the problem of health. You cannot allow yourself 
to go on a diet for two weeks. If you stop, you will get sick 
again. There must be continuity in peacekeeping operations: 
before, during the conflict, and afterwards. You must not stop 
checking up on the patient. There must be permanent attention. 
It is like cleaning the streets of Paris.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Jan 16 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation intends to race ahead with its Partnership 
for Peace plan to forge military links with East Europe and 
Russia, a NATO source said here at the weekend. 
  "There is mega-pressure on everyone to get it up and 
running," he said. NATO leaders signed the Partnership 
initiative at a summit here last week. It has not yet been 
formally accepted by the countries of the former Soviet bloc. 
  However, East Europe plus Russia and other countries of the 
former Soviet Union said during U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
swing through the region after the summit last week that they 
intended to sign up to the initiative. 
  Senior NATO military officials are scheduled to tour East 
European countries and possibly Russia in coming weeks to 
explain exactly what options for cooperation with NATO are on 
offer. 
  The NATO source, speaking on condition that he not be 
identified, said the team could be headed by U.S. General 
George Joulwan, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe. 
  The options range from joint military manoeuvres, 
peacekeeping, search-and-rescue and disaster relief operations 
to military communications, defence planning, training and the 
clean-up of old Soviet military bases. 
  Each country will be allowed to choose from the options and 
decide the level of participation in Partnership for Peace, the 
source said, adding that the choice would depend partly on what 
each country could afford. 
  Military officers from East Bloc countries are expected to 
establish themselves before mid-year at NATO headquarters here 
and at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE) 
near the Belgian city of Mons. 
  The first joint task force exercises are expected to start 
later this year on a small scale in disaster relief or 
peacekeeping. 
  "But they will have a high symbolic value to show that 
things 
are moving," the source said. He added that quick 
implementation of the initiative was critical to its 
credibility. [passage omitted] 
  Asked whether Russia might object to NATO exercises with 
countries of the former Soviet bloc, the NATO source said 
initial projects would involve "things that the Russians in 
their wildest dreams could not consider provocative." 
  He said Russia had so far expressed no objections to 
German-Danish-Polish military manoevres scheduled in the 
European autumn, involving naval exercises in the Baltic Sea and 
land exercises in Denmark. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 14 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees has called on European governments to accept 
asylum-seekers from Kosovo because of harsh winter conditions in 
the majority-Albanian Serbian province. 
  UNHCR spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said Thursday [13 
January] that some areas in Kosovo were without heat or 
electricity and that the human rights situation was also causing 
concern. 
  The organisation has asked governments not to send 
ayslum-seekers back at least until spring -- even if they do not 
fulfil the conditions for refugee status. 
  Switzerland gave temporary shelter to about 1,800 Albanians 
from Kosovo in 1993, but only accorded 100 of them refugee 
status. 
  Several political and religious groups recently tried to 
intervene with Bern authorities in a bid to prevent the 
expulsion of Kosovo Albanians.

  Klaus Schwab said a direct meeting of the two men at the

could not be ruled out. 
  Israeli-PLO talks on Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho have been deadlocked over the size of the Jericho 
area in the West Bank, security for Israeli settlements in the 
Gaza Strip and control of border crossings between the strip and 
Egypt and Jericho and Jordan.

Buwayz by Margaretha Kopeinig; place and date not given: "Key 
Talks in Geneva"] 
  [Text] Lebanon is Syria's closest ally. Margaretha 
Kopeinig conducted an interview with Lebanon's Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz on the following topics: 
  -- The meeting between U.S. President Clinton and Syrian 
President Hafiz Al-Asad: "They are holding key talks. Clinton 
and Al-Asad are holding the major trumps in the Middle East 
peace process. Syria has always been a military and political 
bulwark in the Arab region. Lebanon's biggest problem is that 
10 percent of its territory in the south is occupied by Israel. 
We only want a global settlement." 
  -- Chances for peace between Israel and Syria: "This is not 
a question of time, but a basic question. So far, Israel has 
not made any promises that it will withdraw from southern 
Lebanon or the Golan Heights. Moreover, Israel is still 
quarreling with the PLO over the specific implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, which is only a minimum solution. The 
success of negotiations will depend on whether the Israeli 
Government is ready to fulfill our basic demands." 
  -- Lebanon's future: "Geographically, Lebanon is situated at 
the center of the Middle East conflict and forms the bridge 
between the Orient and the Occident. If our country is paying 
for the costs of regional and global conflicts, it will 
naturally also profit from peace."

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 14 (AFP) -- European Community aid to 
Russia should be more visibly aimed at the victims of economic 
change there, EC Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said Friday [14 
January]. 
  In a speech to a political meeting in Dundee, Scotland, he 
warned that extreme rightwing nationalism in Russia was being 
fuelled by unemployment caused by privatisation, and aggravated 
by the loss of social safety nets. 
  "We need to find ways of assuring the local populations that 
the new system can work, and even provide better services than 
before, and that they will have access to them," Brittan said. 
  He urged more help in training the unemployed in Russia and 
supporting social safety nets, particularly for orphans, the 
elderly and the sick, which were threatened by the break-up of 
large state corporations. 
  Brittan said the EC also needed to open its markets wider to 
imports from East European countries in preparation for bringing 
them into the Community. 
  He singled out steel as typical of sensitive sectors where 
strict barriers against imports of East European products needed 
to be reconsidered. 
  "East Europe has enormous potential in the steel sector. We 
need to sit down together to work out how to reconcile our steel 
policy with the legitimate aspirations of the East," Brittan 
said. 
  He acknowledged that the EC had the largest responsibility 
for helping East Europe, saying: "This is our continent, these 
are our neighbours. It is our common future." 
  But Brittan called on other countries, particularly the 
United States and Japan, to shoulder a fair share of the aid 
burden for East Europe and the former Soviet Union (FSU). 
  He noted that EC aid payments had dwarfed help from the 
United States, accounting for 60 percent of all aid to East 
Europe and the FSU and providing a market for the bulk of 
exports from East Europe. 
  However, the EC commissioner paid tribute to the "vision and 
drive" of U.S. President Bill Clinton's policies towards East 
Europe and Russia, expressed during Clinton's European trip this 
week. 
  "The scale of the challenge to the East is huge. We must 
match this with the scale of the resources that we devote to 
assistance. The member states of the European Union, the United 
States and the other donors must work closely together to ensure 
that we do not fall short of what is needed," Brittan said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho by Herman </F>
Amelink in The Hague on 12 January: "West Too Quick To Judge 
Russia" -- first paragraph is NRC HANDELSBLAD introduction] 
  [Text] The Hague -- [Finnish] Prime Minister Aho feels that 
the growth of Russian nationalism -- as personified in Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy -- is completely understandable given the problems 
that country is struggling with: "Many people expected that, 
after the revolution in Moscow, Russia would become a democracy, 
have a market economy in one or two years, and fully observe 
human rights. Now that this has not happened and extremism 
appears to enjoy a considerable following, people are rapidly 
drawing the opposite conclusion. Both reasonings are wrong. It 
is simply inconceivable, in the light of history, that Russia 
should change overnight." 
  [Amelink] Your government is positive about NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program, and even wants to take part in 
it. Does that not represent a break with Finland's policy of 
neutrality? 
  [Aho] In this context, it is important to make a distinction 
between the countries of East Europe, whose security guarantees 
disappeared with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and the 
neutral and nonaligned countries in Europe. I view the 
Partnership for Peace as an offer of closer cooperation with 
NATO. We are not out to set new rules in the area of our 
security. Our interest extends to that part of the program 
aimed at peacekeeping activities. The Finns have a long 
tradition in this area. Some people are suggesting that we are 
interested in the project in the same way as the countries of 
East Europe. That is not the case. The foundation of Finnish 
foreign policy remains nonalignment and a strong national 
defense. [end Aho] 
  The visit by Prime Minister Aho, who arrived from Dublin and 
who will be traveling to Luxembourg this afternoon, falls within 
the framework of Finland's possible accession to the European 
Union [EU]. These negotiations must be completed by 1 March. 
Finland is primarily concerned with measures to protect its 
agriculture, the prime minister said: "We have to struggle with 
a number of structural problems for which the EU will have to 
allow transitional measures. We need time to adapt to the rules 
of the EU." A tougher matter is the climate, which limits the 
productive period of our agricultural sector. Despite the 
greenhouse effect, there is no possibility of changing that. 
Consequently, a separate system of support loans is needed for 
farmers in the Nordic countries. There are already separate 
rules in the EU for the mountainous areas. We do not have 
those. A new and good criterion to take account of and that 
would benefit our farmers is the degree of latitude. Using this 
criterion, the EU can prevent other countries from using the 
same rule to obtain support for their farmers. A separate rule 
is primarily of interest for supporting the existing social 
structure in the Finnish countryside. 
  [Amelink] The opinion polls give a changing picture of the 
Finnish attitude toward the EU. Do you expect a positive 
outcome from the referendum this fall on EU accession? 
  [Aho] Many people, and especially those in my own Center 
Party, are indeed against it. There is a certain amount of 
hesitation about whether or not you can trust the conditions of 
accession. However, I expect that the majority will agree if we 
can obtain favorable conditions during the negotiations in 
Brussels. They would be crucial in the final judgement. 
  [Amelink] Are you thinking of holding the accession 
referendums in Norway, Sweden, and Finland on the same day? 
  [Aho] That is one option that cannot be ruled out. However, 
it is still too early to speculate on it. We still need a few 
more weeks. 
  [Amelink] The Finnish economy is currently in a slump. 
Despite inflation of about 1 percent, unemployment remains 
above 20 percent. Can you see light at the end of the tunnel? 
  [Aho] In early fall the unemployment rate stopped rising, 
but 
I must admit that this really is an enormous problem. If 
investment resumes -- and there are initial signs that this is 
beginning -- then the situation in the labor market will 
gradually improve. The fact that our exports have risen 
considerably recently will increase room for new investments, 
but the employment situation will certainly not improve in such 
a dramatically quick way.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Norway has no intention 
of giving up whaling even if this prejudices its chances of 
joining the European Community, Norwegian officials said here 
Monday [17 January]. But Karsten Klepsvik, Oslo's 
representative to the International Whaling Commission, said he 
did not believe that the issue by itself would sink Norway's 
application to join the Community. 
  The whaling issue, along with Norway's efforts to protect 
its 
fishing waters and high agricultural subsidies, has emerged as a 
leading obstacle in efforts to finalise the EC membership 
negotiations by March 1. 
  "I do not believe (whaling) will be the only outstanding 
issue which will decide if we enter the EC or not," Klepsvik 
told journalists, adding that the issue would not be resolved 
quickly. 
  EC officials say the negotiations with Norway are harder 
than 
with Sweden, Austria and Finland, which have also applied to 
join the EC by January 1, 1995. But the 12 EC countries have 
not yet agreed on whether to insist that Norway honour a 
Community ban on all whaling, in accordance with an 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) embargo in 1985, as a 
condition for EC membership. 
  Diplomats said France, Spain, Britain and the Netherlands 
were particularly militant in enforcing the IWC whaling ban, and 
that EC public opinion was strongly against whaling. 
  Klepsvik warned that it would be difficult to persuade 
Norwegian voters to accept EC membership if this meant an end to 
whaling. Whale meat is considered a healthy delicacy in Norway, 
where about 300 tonnes is eaten each year. 
  According to the latest public opinion survey, 53 percent of 
Norwegians are against membership of the EC and only 33 percent 
in favour. 
  Norway resumed commercial hunting of the minke whale, a 
mid-sized baleen whale weighing up to 9,000 kilograms (about 
20,000 pounds), last year after a suspension of nearly six years. 
  The officials said Norway restricted the number of whales 
caught last year to 296, and was likely to impose a similar 
quota this year. "There will be no over-exploitation," Norwegian 
whaling academic Lars Walloe said. 
  The officials said just 33 vessels were authorised to hunt 
the minke whale, and that large-scale factory ships and the 
hunting of all other types of whales had been banned in 
accordance with the IWC embargo. 
  The Norwegian officials said that minke whales in the 
northeastern Atlantic numbered around 87,000, that their 
population was recovering from a 1950's dip, and that they did 
not face the same extinction threat as other whales. But the 
ecological organisation Greenpeace said these figures were 
unreliable, particularly since they had been based on sightings 
by Norwegian whalers. 
  "It's a bit like asking the wolf to fence off the flock," 
Greenpeace official Andy Ottaway said. 
  Walloe said whales were no more intelligent than other large 
mammals such as elk or reindeer, and no more deserving of 
protection on moral grounds. He added that the minke whales 
were killed as humanely as possible. 
  Government inspectors are present on all Norwegian whaling 
boats. Walloe said the minke whales were hit by grenade 
harpoons, which killed 50 percent of their victims 
instantaneously and 90 percent of them within 10 minutes. 
  The Norwegian habit of clubbing baby seals also runs counter 
to EC sentiment. The Community has a ban on all seal imports.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Johnson: "Macedonia on a Knife-Edge"] </F>
  [Text] Skopje -- Greece is holding a knife against the 
jugular of the tiny Macedonian economy as Athens continues 
threatening to cut off oil supplies, according to senior Western 
officials in Skopje. 
  British and other diplomats yesterday made little secret of 
their distaste at Greece's treatment of the Balkan country given 
diplomatic recognition last month by six of the 12 EC countries. 

    "They won't give the Macedonians visas. In fact, they are 
being about as bloody as they could possibly be," said one 
Western source. 
  Greeks suspect Germany and Britain of granting diplomatic 
recognition to gain influence in the Balkans. 
  Despite taking over the presidency of the EC Council, Mr 
Papandreou's Government has stopped supply of vital goods, from 
washing machine parts to food, mainly because domestic pressure 
over Macedonia is so strong. Greek workers at oil terminals in 
Thessaloniki this week volunteered to stop shipments to 
Macedonia in anger at its use of a name they say can be applied 
only to their northern province. 
  The Greek blockade has left the border roads deserted, and 
economic conditions in the former Yugoslav republic have 
worsened, with pay cuts and falling national output. 
  The barter system has collapsed with the break-up of 
Yugoslavia, and drought has put two of the country's 
hydro-electric plants out of service. 
  Many of the 600,000 inhabitants of Skopje, the capital, are 
dependent on the "Makedonia" oil refinery for their livelihoods, 
and now depend on it for fuel, giving Greece an effective 
stranglehold. Mr. Tony Millson, the new British ambassador to 
Macedonia, said: "The oil trains are still coming through from 
Thessaloniki, otherwise we wouldn't be sitting here with the 
lights on." 
  Shops and markets are also still stocked with food, but 
inflation is running at 230 percent. 
  Western officials close to the sanctions-monitoring 
operation 
said Albania tried to appease Athens, offering to avoid use of 
the name Macedonia on shipments to Greece, substituting "Chamber 
of Commerce of Skopje." Skopje is Greece's preferred name for 
the state. 
  Britain and others are trying to step up pressure on Athens 
by touting plans for an East-West corridor, running from Albania 
to Bulgaria via Macedonia. They hope this would make Macedonia 
less dependent on Greece.

  [Text] The Greek Government has agreed to help the Labour 
Party bring pressure on Mr. Major over the Maastricht Treaty's 
Social Chapter. 
  The prime minister opted Britain out of EU [European Union] 
decision-making on social matters like workers' rights. 
  But Greek Social Affairs Minister Vangelis Giannopoulos 
[name 
as received] has told British socialist Euro MPs that he would 
be pressing for decisions by the other 11 member states if 
necessary. 
  The other states have been reluctant to invoke a social 
policy without Britain, on the grounds that it would lead to a 
damaging rift within the Community. 
  But Mr. Giannopoulos, who will be chairing EU meetings on 
social issues for the next six months while Greece holds the EU 
Presidency, said: "It is difficult to move away from the system 
of unanimity. But I will bring these things forward and get a 
decision even if that means just 11." 
  He told Euro-socialists in Athens: "I hope I will be 
successful. Perhaps the British Labour Party will come into 
government and Britain will rejoin the ranks." 
  Labour Euro MP David Martin said: "The Major government has 
blocked and frustrated attempts to create a genuine European 
social policy. 
  "It is time for the other 11 governments to say loud and 
clear that they will no longer tolerate the UK preventing the 
Community from making progress on rights of temporary and 
part-time workers, protection of young workers, fair pay and 
parental leave."

<F P=106> [Article by R. Winkel: "And Then There Was One ..."] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- When Prime Minister Lubbers was asked 
point blank at the end of last year whether he wanted to become 
European Commission president, he did not give a direct answer. 
I know two candidates who are better qualified than I am, was 
his cryptic reply. 
  He revealed nothing about the identity of his dream 
candidates. But it can be assumed that one of them was Spanish 
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. Like Lubbers, it has been 
suspected that for many years he has wanted to swap the hard 
life of a prime minister for the busy, but less taxing, job in 
Brussels. 
  Since Monday [10 January] Gonzalez has no longer been in the 
running, however. At the last European summit, he had stated 
that the damp climate of the European capital was not to his 
taste. Now, in an interview with a number of Spanish 
journalists on the fringes of the NATO summit, he has said quite 
directly that to his mind there is just one candidate -- his 
Netherlands colleague. 
  In contrast to the noncommittal Lubbers, Gonzalez has 
revealed all. This is notable for more than one reason. When 
asked, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said that Lubbers would 
be an excellent candidate, but this holds rather less weight. 
It would be difficult for Kohl to say that he found his 
immediate and loyal neighbor -- who also comes from a party of 
the same political persuasion -- anything but suitable. 
  With Gonzalez the situation is rather different. Although 
political opponents like to compare him to Thatcher, Gonzalez is 
in the socialist camp. And, what is much more significant in 
Europe, Lubbers is a representative from the chilly north, who 
is keeping a tight grasp on the domestic purse strings and, in 
foreign affairs, wants to be carried along on the uncertain 
waves of free trade. 
  Given this, the fact that the Spanish prime minister has set 
the lobby moving to install Lubbers in Brussels is indeed 
notable. There are probably sharks in the waters which would 
cause much more concern to the Latin member states. British 
European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is unashamedly interested 
in the job, and Sir Leon has the knack of getting what he wants. 
Perhaps Chancellor Kohl -- who is rumored to want a European 
cushion on which to lay his weary head -- is also considered by 
Spain as tending a little too much toward "Mitteleuropa." 
  But there may be another reason for Gonzalez' open campaign 
in favor of Lubbers. On Monday he confirmed that the Twelve 
government leaders had decided two years ago to recruit the next 
Commission president from among their own number. With the 
Treaty of European Union, Europe was to enter a new and more 
glorious stage in its development. An "ordinary" former 
minister (such as Jacques Delors), therefore, would no longer be 
able to call the shots. 
  But, in the meantime, the tide has turned. In the storm over 
Maastricht, it was principally the Commission which suffered the 
heavy damage. The trend -- already present in the Treaty -- of 
giving more power to heads of government has been reinforced. 
This is very clearly apparent in the conclusions of the latest 
EC summit. They are all about the member states and the European 
Council. The Commission is presented as a service bureau which 
may prepare reports for the technical preparation, but must 
remain well clear of any political decisionmaking. 
  Seen in this light it becomes less evident than two years 
ago 
to give the Commission president the halo associated with former 
premiership and -- because the shine has worn off -- also much 
less likely that a former prime minister will be interested in 
the job. Who -- apart from Wilfred Martens, who is still waiting 
in line after a difficult career in national politics -- would 
want to manage a European house of mourning? 
  Yet Gonzalez apparently prefers a man with the authority of 
Lubbers rather than a southerner whom the northern countries 
would take less seriously. He has not taken the semirefusal of 
Lubbers as a veiled invitation ("I would like to, but only if I 
am asked"), but as a genuine expression of reluctance. Lubbers' 
wife has also left this impression in the gossip columns. The 
campaign to "Pull Lubbers over the line" has begun, but success 
is far from assured.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The European Publishers 
Council (EPC) said here Monday [17 January] that a proposed law 
to limit media concentrations would cripple the ability of 
European companies to compete in new global information 
technology. 
  It said that a resolution to be debated in the European 
Parliament at Strasbourg on Thursday was aiming at new 
restrictions at a time when U.S. media companies were being 
freed to face up to a technological media revolution. 
  EPC chairman Sir Frank Rogers said the threat of new 
regulations came "at the very moment when media companies are 
attempting to ensure that the European Union is a major player 
on the global information superhighway." 
  Rogers, deputy chairman of Britain's Telegraph group, said 
the resolution was dangerous because recent developments in 
global information, communications and media technology required 
a less restrictive approach. 
  The resolution, sponsored by Euro-MPs Ben Fayot of 
Luxembourg 
and Dieter Schinzel of Germany, would give the European 
Community power to limit European-wide print and audiovisual 
concentrations which "threaten diversity of opinion and 
pluralism." 
  The Fayot-Schinzel motion says that multimedia concentration 
should be "assessed more effectively and, if necessary, limited." 
  But Rogers said the motion ignored evidence presented by the 
EPC, which represents 27 European publishers and is pushing for 
less, rather than more, control on cross-border investment and 
ownership of media companies. He said the current revolution in 
digital, interactive media technology required that media 
companies should be free to join forces in order to exploit 
these new developments. 
  "Yet Europe could be left on a side road while American and 
Japanese media companies are freed to dominate the new global 
opportunities," he said. 
  The EC's executive European Commission is expected to make 
formal proposals on framework policies for the media industry in 
three or four months. 
  The industry has been lobbying fiercely for several years 
against any regulations or even policy guidelines from Brussels.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 14 (AFP) -- France and Germany are 
considering using converted Tupolev 154's as spy planes to watch 
over foreign military bases in terms of the 1992 Conventional 
Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, the French Defence Ministry 
magazine INFO-DGA reported on Friday [14 January]. 
  The formerly Soviet planes, recovered by Germany, would be 
used for economy reasons, INFO-DGA, magazine of the General 
Armaments Delegation said. 
  The 22 CFE signatory countries also agreed to "open skies" 
overflights from this year of bases up to now considered secret. 
  A first experimental spy flight by a converted Tupolev took 
place over French bases at the end of last year, INFO-DGA said. 
  Britain was also involved in the experiment in which flight 
procedures and photographic equipment were tested. The aim was 
also to teach personnel on the ground how to conceal equipment 
they wish to keep secret, the magazine said. 
  The Tupolevs will reinforce ground and satellite inspections 
already taking place under CFE. 
  At the end of this year, France, Italy and Spain will launch 
the Helios military observation satellite, a key element in 
disarmament inspection, INFO-DGA said.

  [Text] Last year, the three major airliner manufacturers 
[Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas] faced one business 
difficulty after another. Together, they sold fewer than 300

signs that it has peaked. In 1993, regular international 
passenger traffic increased by 7 percent, and freight traffic by 
8 percent, which is very encouraging. But the company tills are 
empty and it will be a long time before they are firmly back on 
their feet. 
  Also, paradoxically, fuel is at present "too cheap." This 
means that the new generation of aircraft -- which are 
particularly fuel efficient -- have lost much of their appeal. 
The manufacturers are thus failing to obtain their just rewards. 
  About a 1,000 airliners are presently grounded, waiting 
patiently for better days to come in impressive parking lots in 
the California desert. 
  In fact, about 500 of them will never leave the ground 
again: 
apart from the fact that their owners have simply disappeared 
(Pan Am, Eastern, and others), they are technically and 
economically outdated. But there remain the other 500 more 
recent aircraft -- some virtually new -- which sooner or later 
are destined to find themselves back on the runways of major 
airports. 
  This surplus represents 12 months of production for Boeing, 
McDonnel Douglas, and Airbus Industrie. Which means that these 
"big three" are going to have to wait an extra year following 
any real recovery before being able to benefit from increased 
contracts. 
  In the meantime, the manufacturers are having to make the 
best of a bad situation. Boeing has sharply cut its production 
and is gradually shedding almost 28,000 jobs. McDonnel Douglas 
is taking a similar course of action but does have the benefit 
of the wealth and diversity of military orders. 
  Airbus Industrie, on the other hand, is developing in a much 
more original context. The European consortium has, for the 
time being, succeeded in stabilizing production, despite a 
disastrous balance sheet at the end of 1993. 
  With 38 new orders and 69 cancellations, the group ended the 
year with a seriously negative net deficit. But in 1994 it will 
nevertheless be delivering 134 aircraft, just two less [than in 
1992.] Moreover, 138 deliveries are scheduled for 1995 and 154 
for 1996. 
  This favorable situation is linked to the fact that the 
range 
of European models has been widened, providing access to new 
markets. This is true of both the A330 and A340 jumbo jets and 
the A321, a 180-seater which is in direct competition with the 
Boeing 757. 
<H5>  A Turning Point </H5>
  On 31 December, 667 planes were recorded in the Airbus 
Industrie order book. Since then, the A340 orders from Air 
Canada and the A319 orders from Air Inter have come in. This 
explains the confidence in the future. 
  Nevertheless, many of the aircraft now on order will not be 
supplied until the end of the decade. And, in order to maintain 
the present rate of activity, Airbus Industrie must quickly win 
further orders. 
  Seen in this way, 1994 looks to be a year fraught with 
problems. Either the recession will cause further cancellations 
or the net balance will return to positive figures. In the 
latter eventuality, may they rejoice in Toulouse. 
  But in the former eventuality, there will be every reason 
for 
the greatest concern. The verdict will be out in 11 and 
one-half months.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Arianespace is to launch the 
next three satellites to be run by the European weather 
satellite service EUMETSAT in the first five years of the next 
century, according to a statement released here Monday [10 
January]. 
  Under a preliminary contract signed Monday, Arianespace will 
launch three satellites in 2001, 2002 and 2005, the EUMETSAT 
statement said. 
  The three Meteosat craft "will offer high performance 
meteological coverage until at least 2012," the statement said. 
  The contracts for the three satellites will be negotiated 
separately "to allow EUMETSAT to benefit from a very competitive 
and attractive commercial situation," EUMETSAT director John 
Morgan said. 
  EUMETSAT was set up in 1986 by 17 countries and provides 
weather satellite services for Europe from its base at 
Darmstadt-Eberstadt near Frankfurt.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend </F>
by Hans-Henning Scharsach in Vienna; date not given: "`Europe 
Must Do More Itself for Its Security'"] 
  [Text] Has Europe become more secure? Following the NATO 
summit in Brussels and President Clinton's visit to Prague, 
Kiev, and Moscow, Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend discussed 
topics of international security policy in a KURIER interview. 
  -- The new NATO concept: The fact that the Eastern reform 
states have not been accepted as members is not primarily a 
concession to Russian President Yeltsin. The foremost 
consideration in this is the alliance's unity. Homogeneous 
political, economic, and social structures are the real strength 
of NATO. This requires an adaptation process of several years 
for prospective members. I expect this process to be concluded 
before the end of this decade. 
  -- Consequences for Europe: We must not draw the wrong 
conclusions from the outcome in Brussels. The truth is that 
Europe will have to do more for its security by itself, also in 
the future. 
  -- Consequences for Austria: We are going a different way: 
Security via integration. Austria will try to codetermine 
European security within the European Union. 
  -- Clinton's foreign policy: However fervently the U.S. 
President may state the opposite, the fact is that following the 
end of the Cold War American interests have moved away from 
Europe. And a power vacuum has formed in the Pacific area, 
which has the highest population growth and where some of the 
countries have two-digit economic growth rates. Japan, the 
leading economic power, only has a very small army. Opening up 
of Communism requires a different security policy in that part 
of the world. 
  There are also other parts of the world that are more 
important to the United States than Europe at the moment: the 
Middle East for instance, where the peace process demands 
support; or the petroleum producing countries, upon whose 
political stability the United States' economy is dependent. 
  -- The situation in Russia: The recent developments should 
not be dramatized. History has shown that times of big changes 
tend to play into the hands of radical nationalists. But the 
danger must not be underestimated, either. In Russia we have 
the same situation now as before the elections: The president 
faces a parliament where communists and nationalists hold a 
majority. Considering this, a long period of political and 
military instability can be expected. 
  -- Nuclear arms: In view of the distribution of arms in four 
states of the former Soviet Union and considering the 
diminishing central power and control, nobody can rule out that 
mass destruction arms get into the wrong hands. This is the 
real challenge to American security policy. Beside continuing 
efforts for disarmament, it would be important to include the 
new nuclear arms countries in a network of international 
monitoring.

  [Text] What will Bill Clinton take home from his trip to 
Europe and Russia? First of all, two new saxophones. He 
received one in Belgium and one from Vaclav Havel. 
  What else? Clinton again staged a perfect show in front of 
skeptical Europeans and half-interested Russians. What was the 
substance of his visit? Clinton made the East Europeans accept 
the second-best solution (Partnership for Peace) instead of NATO 
membership (they really had no choice). He dodged the issue of 
Bosnia; he made Ukraine renounce its nuclear weapons (for the 
time being), and he promised Yeltsin a great deal of money. 
  All in all, this is not a bad result. However -- and this is 
typical of Clinton -- numerous issues remain unsettled. How 
much is the Partnership for Peace really worth? Will the 
agreement with Ukraine hold? And: How important is Yeltsin 
still?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Raymonde Dury: "Bosnia and NATO"] </F>
  [Text] The illusions about the post-Cold War period have 
fallen away. The dividend peace was supposed to bring has yet 
to be seen. The cancers of obscurantist nationalism, frozen 
under the Communist regimes, have reappeared with ferocious 
virulence. And the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been growing 
worse for 20 months. 
  I am shocked. We all are shocked at the fate met by these 
women, these men, and these children who succumb to the hail of 
bullets, shells, rockets, and sniper fire. Yet how can we 
forget? The inhabitants of Sarajevo are dying for our values 
and the for the ideals we defend in Europe: democracy, human 
rights, the rejection of borders changed through force, 
tolerance, and multinational and multicultural coexistence. 
  The malaise and impotence of the UN troops on the ground 
have 
become more noticeable since the announced departure of General 
Briquemont. Moreover, at the NATO summit, it was decided to 
open up Tuzla, whose airport is essential for channeling 
humanitarian aid, and Srebrenica, where three hundred UN troops 
cannot be relieved. NATO is again talking of air strikes if the 
Serbs try to prevent these actions. 
  This decisive tone is something new. To say that we let the 
situation rot away until we reached the current impasse is an 
understatement. Those people, and I am one of them, who have 
always fought for peace in the world, have long demanded more 
energetic action be taken in Bosnia -- apart from the required 
humanitarian aid -- against militias on all sides which hold the 
civilian population hostage and commit intolerable crimes. One 
such person bitterly summed up the position of the international 
community: "It is striving tirelessly to try not to be able to 
do anything." 
  If NATO, with the agreement of the United Nations, finally 
decides to move, and if all this is not just another gesture 
like some Serbs are already saying, then we must be pleased that 
Europe and the international community are finally taking their 
responsibility without waiting for new disasters; without 
waiting for war and winter to once again forge their horror or 
for thousands more deaths and refugees to be added to a long 
list; without looking for a scapegoat -- the United Nations -- 
or ways out, such as the lie of the land, guerrilla warfare, or 
the price to be paid. 
  Coherence between the decisions made in the Security Council 
and NATO, on the one hand, and their application, on the other, 
must have a double objective: first a humanitarian one, and 
then a political one -- because nobody believes that a military 
solution alone is possible. 
  However, Europe and the international community must become 
credible again in the eyes of public opinion -- and in the eyes 
of the ethnic cleansers. Public opinion wants peace and 
remembers that in a democracy, it is the one in charge. This 
time, public opinion will not find it acceptable if these words 
are not followed up with action. It will keep a close eye on the 
action taken. And it will not forget Sarajevo.

  [Text] A spokesperson for the United Nations peacekeeping 
force in Bosnia reports that the Bosnian Serbs have agreed to 
allow Canadian blue helmets stationed in the Moslem enclave of 
Srebrenica to be relieved by Netherlander troops. 
  Early this week NATO had threatened the Serbs with air 
attacks if they continued to block the Canadians departure and 
the passage of food transports. 
  The Netherlander Ministry of Defense is to send a total of 
1,000 extra soldiers to Bosnia as soon as it receives the 
official invitation it is waiting for from the UN commander in 
former Yugoslavia. 
  The new Netherlander troops will be divided between 
Srebrenica and the enclave of Zepa. 
  The Canadian Government said yesterday it expects its troops 
in Srebrenica to be relieved within two weeks.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 14 (AFP) -- NATO forces monitoring 
aircraft movements in the former Yugoslavia have no information 
to confirm reports from UN forces in Bosnia that Croat planes 
bombed towns in the centre of the country, a spokesman said 
Friday [14 January]. 
  "We don't have any confirmation at the moment either with 
AWACS (radar planes) or visually by Deny Flight pilots. Right 
now we have nothing to substantiate or to confirm that such 
attacks took place," a spokesman at the Supreme Headquarters 
Allied Powers in Europe said. 
  According to military sources here, the UN spokesman in 
Sarajevo who implicated Croat planes in the attacks on Vitez and 
Novni Travnik based his statements on reports from the Bosnian 
Government military. 
  NATO officials had been trying to confirm the bombings with 
UN observers on the ground or from NATO planes monitoring the 
situation, but had only been able to trace the source of the 
story back to the Moslem-majority government, the military 
sources said. 
  UN Protection Force spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman 
said Friday that planes and helicopters launched rocket attacks 
Thursday on areas controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian 
Army in central Bosnia. 
  Aikman implicitly pointed the finger at the Bosnian Croat 
HVO 
forces who are fighting Moslem forces in the area. 
  Some 160 NATO planes are stationed in Italy and on aircraft 
carriers in the Adriatic as part of "Operation Deny Flight" over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Smart: "Fear Prevents Twelve Becoming </F>
One"] 
  [Text] With fear of immigration, drugs and crime at the 
top of national political agendas across West Europe, the quest 
for concerted action is increasingly urgent for the Twelve. Yet 
the past two months have proved that agreeing that there shall 
be a common European Union [EU] policy is one thing, agreeing 
what that policy should be is quite another. 
  Since last November a new framework for EU states to tackle 
these matters "a douze" has existed in the guise of the interior 
and justice "third pillar" of the Maastricht Treaty. But, as 
last week's tough clampdown against illegal immigrants by 
France's hardline Interior Minister Charles Pasqua proved, 
politicians are not ready to downplay the national dimension of 
such gut issues for the sake of Europe-wide policies. 
  Indeed, a taste of the problems to come surfaced last month 
at the very first EU council of interior and justice ministers. 
Spain flatly refused to agree to the setting-up of a fledgling 
police force, Europol, an integral part of the Maastricht Treaty 
designed to spearhead Europe's war against drug barons and to 
hunt down gangs smuggling in immigrants. It also blocked moves 
towards a Europe-wide asylum law. 
  Madrid's motive was simple. It was retaliating against a 
Belgian government decision to grant temporary asylum to two 
Spaniards accused of being Basque separatists. How, asked the 
Spanish, can the EU debate common asylum rules if one EU state 
is busy granting asylum to citizens of another? To the 
irritation of the others, the Dutch also held up the proceedings 
because of their obligation to report to their national 
parliament. 
  Though not auspicious, this was far from a disastrous start 
for Europe's move towards a coherent interior policy. The spat, 
after all, was merely the latest in a long line of similar rows. 
Among these are the delays inflicted by Pasqua on the Schengen 
open-border accord after a no-holds-barred attack on liberal 
Dutch drug laws, and the feud between Britain and Spain over 
Gibraltar, which has prevented the signing of the EU's External 
Frontiers Convention. 
  No one realistically expected that progress would be other 
than patchy. Adrian Fortescue, the responsible official at the 
EU Commission, can say with conviction: "These are early days, 
but we have got off to a very reasonable start." One difficulty 
is that public fears -- such as that of being overrun by 
immigrants -- run deep. With political hot potatoes such as 
these, there is only limited scope for the horse-trading between 
the Twelve on which Brussels normally thrives. Moreover, unlike 
the new foreign and security aspects of the Maastricht Treaty, 
inauguration of the interior and justice pillar was not a 
relabelling of an already functioning process. Rather, creation 
of the new decision-making mechanism has meant a bewildering 
array of ad hoc groups have had to be unified. 
  Even so, the new structure is itself pretty labyrinthine. 
The Treaty of European Union puts asylum and immigration into 
the third pillar of the Union. This is basically a 
government-to-government mechanism, although the Commission 
shares the right to initiate policy. By contrast, visa policy 
was shunted into the main "first" pillar of the Union, where the 
EU Commission enjoys sole right of initiative. Under the 
Commissioner responsible for justice, Padraig Flynn, the 
Commission has been quick off the mark with its new powers: 
Brussels officials have embarked on a fundamental review of 
immigration and asylum. They are examining not just the 
question of access but far wider issues such as the economic 
factors that lead people to uproot themselves from their 
homelands in the first place and ways in which they can best be 
integrated once they have reached the shores of the Union. 
  Once completed, the document will go to the full Commission 
for approval early next month. The Commission will be at pains 
not to stir up a hornets' nest by the inclusion of too many 
contentious proposals, but the tensions underlying the EU's 
foray into this most sensitive of policy areas are never far 
from the surface. Britain is still hoping to limit the 
encroachment of Brussels into the fields of justice and interior 
affairs. 
  Though not opposed in principle to Europol, London is 
determined to keep the organisation strictly nonoperational -- 
that is, as an intelligence network without the power to make 
arrests. And it is similarly jealous of its rights over asylum 
and immigration policies. 
  By contrast, to Bonn even the basic architecture of the 
interior and justice pillars did not go far enough. Germany 
remains keen to pass responsibility for asylum policy over to 
the EU, and is still attracted to the idea that this can be done 
by sharing round the incomers through quotas among the member 
state -- not a welcome idea in other capitals. 
  Chancellor Kohl is beset by fears about the growth of 
organized crime: foreign diplomats complain that he keeps 
harking back to reports that the Mafia bought up every pizza 
parlour in eastern Germany. And he still wants Europol to be a 
real counterpart to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the 
United States. 
  Ironically, those governments, such as the German one, 
wanting more control at the Union level find themselves sharing 
a common cause with the very groups set up to help the refugees 
whose entry they wish to curb. 
  Refugees' groups say that there is an unanswerable need for 
the Twelve to adopt a comprehensive asylum policy. Anne 
Castagnos of the Paris-based France Terre d'Asile comments: "It 
is vital that groups like ours can make representations during 
the decision-making process rather than seeing policy created 
behind closed doors, as at present. We want a coherent, open 
policy with both national parliaments and with European 
Parliament having a much bigger say."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- According to government spokesman

Vogel told journalists in Bonn today that the Federal 
Government assumes that the policy of reform will be continued 
in Russia. The German Government does not have the slightest 
grounds for doubting this. It also wanted the policy of reform 
to be continued, Vogel is quoted as saying.

<F P=106> [Article by Dieter Buhl: "Central To Security"] </F>
  [Text] The Old World can take a breath of relief. It has 
not been forgotten by America. After a year of negligence, the 
American President has now paid his reverence to Europe. 
Although Bill Clinton's tight agenda bears resemblance to his 
fellow citizens' package tours -- it is Tuesday, it must be 
Prague -- it does fulfill an important purpose. A disheartened 
continent gets support and, what is more decisive, it 
experiences the first signs of political determination. Thus, 
the doubts about this President's priorities in foreign policy 
should be cleared for the time being. 
  Is America, thus, no longer banking on the "Pacific future"? 
Is American politics returning to "Eurocentrism," of which 
Secretary of State Christopher warned as recently as last 
November? Still, all compliments and oaths of loyalty made by 
Clinton cannot conceal where he sees his main challenges -- at 
home, for the social and economic renewal of his country. Apart 
from that, with its dynamic national economies and huge markets, 
Asia remains an object of American hope. Europe, instead, only 
creates interest at the other side of the Atlantic as a nuisance 
factor [preceding two words in English], or a problem child. 
  Thus, for his trip, the President has neither been inspired 
by compassion nor by nostalgia but by his very own interests. 
This is also reflected in the most important statement of his 
tour: "Europe remains central to our security." That means, 
America's fate remains linked to Europe's. In light of the 
atrocities in the Balkans, economic decline and spreading 
nationalism, the President has reason enough to make his 
contribution to stabilizing the continent. He is trying in 
three ways. 
  First, with his appeal to the West Europeans' "collective 
spirit." Clinton wants the success of the European Union. He 
is no longer even terrified by the idea of an independent 
security structure of the Europeans. The advantages of a 
functioning Union are more important to him than the traditional 
reservations: Such a union could assume a greater burden in 
world politics, above all, it could have a stabilizing effect on 
all of Europe. Those Europeans who ignore this one function of 
European Union should let the U.S. President remind them of it. 
  Second, with his encouraging backslapping for the East 
Europeans. The mixed reactions from the Central-East European 
capitals may relativize the importance of the Partnership for 
Peace. Yet, under American direction, it was NATO that started 
to knit an all-European security network, even though it is 
knitted coarsely still. If it is extended by ever increasing 
economic streams between East and West, it may be much more 
conducive to peace than military cooperation. Clinton's motto 
-- "Trade is more important than aid" -- makes sense. 
Particularly when America itself is opening its doors even 
wider to goods from the East. 
  Third, with the support of the Russian reform forces. 
Different than his predecessor Bush, Clinton banked on 
intensive support for Russia from the very beginning. After 
all, the idea of a bursting Russian nuclear empire is enough to 
focus attention. Still, even the Kremlin could not expect lots 
of money from the President's visit. Instead, Clinton had to 
offer advice, respect, and the readiness to intensify 
Russian-American dialogue. One result of the 
confidence-building conversation is Ukraine's announcement to 
give up its nuclear arms. Moscow and Washington were able to 
move the Ukrainian president to commit himself to it. Yet, the 
reluctant Parliament in Kiev still has to give its support 
before at least this nuclear source of danger can be sealed off. 
  What are the impressions Bill Clinton will take home on 
Sunday? Despite some success he is not likely to feel free from 
Thomas Jefferson's "complete horror of everything that links us 
to European politics." The President will have to put up with 
it in the future, too. America's security does not leave him 
any other choice.

  [Text] At 1600 yesterday a Turkish patrol boat attacked the 
Greek fishing boat "Ayios Yeoryios" six miles off Samos. The 
Turks pursued and fired shots to immobilize the boat just two 
and a half miles from the island's shore. They later tried to 
tow it to Turkey, but were unsuccessful because the Greek 
freighter "Avandi," which sailed from Karlovasi Harbor, arrived 
carrying port authority officials and soldiers. 
  The Turks were frightened, and abandoned their efforts. 
Brothers Panayiotis and Mikhail Dhritsakis, each married with 
three children, were aboard the fishing boat and in shock from 
the attack. The Samos Port police boats pursued the Turks to 
international waters.

<F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Kallinikou] </F>
  [Excerpts] The report broadcast by Antenna Television 
Thursday [13 January] night regarding the supposed arrival of 
Greek commandos in Cyprus for joint exercises with the National 
Guard, within the framework of the new Cyprus-Greece defense 
doctrine, was irresponsible and in violation of journalistic 
norms. The report finally "armed" Turkish propaganda with 
plenty of ammunition; they can capitalize on it, and attempt to 
utilize it in the political arena. [passage omitted] 
  Earlier, Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis expressed 
hopes that no harm would come as a result of the way the issue 
was reported by Antenna Television and that some parties -- 
implying the Turks -- would not capitalize on it. [passage 
omitted] 
  Despite condemnation of Antenna's reporting on this issue by 
the government, various journalists, and the Union of Cypriot 
Editors, as well as by the public -- because even it the news 
item was correct, it should not have been broadcast because it 
falls within sensitive aspects of the island's defense and 
security -- Antenna Director Yeoryios Tsalakos attempted 
yesterday to defend the station. During last night's newscast, 
Antenna refrained either from apologizing or from making at 
least the essential self-criticism. Tsalakos told Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation that the station's correspondent had 
gone to cover an activity and had used a common journalistic 
method. He claimed that the issue is the police arrest of the 
correspondent and his crew. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the facts now, the truth is that the Greek 
reservist commandos did not come for exercises, and in any case 
they do not have any relation to the Greece-Cyprus joint defense 
space. The Greek reservist commandos arrived at the invitation 
of the Nicosia chapter of the Association of Reservist 
Commandos. [passage omitted] 
  The government spokesman said that according to his 
information, the Antenna correspondent and crew went to the 
airport and said they wanted to film the arrival in Cyprus of 
[Greek actress] Aliki Vouyiouklaki. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The talks between the head of state [Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro] and [Giorgio] Napolitano, the speaker of the Chamber 
of Deputies, lasted over an hour. A communique issued by the 
Quirinale [president's office] explained that Napolitano was 
received by Scalfaro in accordance with Article 88 of the 
Constitution. Essentially, Scalfaro heard him, as the 
constitutional document stipulates, before dissolving parliament. 
  Napolitano has not made any statement. He limited himself to 
saying that he did not know the date of the election, and that 
it would be chosen by the government. He was asked if elections 
would be held on 20 March, since Jews have reportedly been 
assured that elections will not clash with Passover.

<F P=106> [Commentary signed "W.A.": "Clinton and Yeltsin"] </F>
  [Text] Yeltsin could hardly have wished for more. Aided 
by Kohl and Kinkel at the Bundestag, in Moscow Clinton assured 
his Kremlin host loquaciously that the West would continue to 
count on him and to place its trust in him. In the opinion of 
Zhirinovskiy, that bizarre international rabble-rouser, 
Washington and Bonn are banking on the wrong person, although 
that is the very reason why in the current situation, from the 
West and East European viewpoint, the Russian president can be 
the only right person. Also it would have flattered Yeltsin to 
learn from Clinton that it was above all up to the United States 
and Russia to assist the old continent in developing a new 
security structure. However, there must be serious reservations 
about that as long as not only right-wing extremists, who did so 
alarmingly well in the Duma elections, but also the old 
Bolsheviks cannot come to terms with the collapse of the Eastern 
empire. 
  Nevertheless, that will scarcely cast a shadow over the 
satisfaction that Clinton as well as Yeltsin will have 
particular reason for feeling this Friday. Both are being 
offered the kind of foreign policy success that they badly need 
at home in President Kravchuk's agreement to join them in Moscow 
to conclude a treaty on destroying the nuclear arsenal that was 
left in Ukraine following the collapse of the Soviet Union. If 
the parliament in Kiev, which will shortly face new elections, 
does not behave awkwardly once again, Russia will remain the 
only nuclear power among the republics that succeeded the Soviet 
Union. In this respect, too, Clinton was given strong support 
from the chancellor and foreign minister in Bonn on Thursday; on 
the previous evening in Kiev, Clinton knew how to use 
sensitivity and diplomatic skill to convince Kravchuk that 
foreign assistance and international recognition were much more 
important for an economically deprived Ukraine than nuclear 
muscle-flexing. 
  The West should, of course, stop continually issuing 
warnings 
about isolating the core country of the former Soviet empire as 
soon as Russia's neighbors talk about their security needs. It 
is not for the United States or Europe, but solely for Russia, 
to decide whether or not it wants to isolate itself.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "The Bill and Boris Show"] </F>
  [Text] This was Bill Clinton's summit and Boris Yeltsin's 
knighting as the United States' junior partner -- not a bad 
balance sheet for the two politicians but hardly a promotion for 
old Europe. In exchange for a small porcelain figure showing 
Clinton as a saxophone player, Yeltsin received a belated 
Christmas package -- consisting of four sizable presents. 
  One was a personal gift from Bill to Boris: The 
demonstrative hug for the Russian president by the U.S. 
president, designed to signal to the whole world: Yeltsin is 
our man. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made it clear to 
Moscow prior to Clinton's trip that Yeltsin "is by far the best 
advocate of the democracy progress and thus the best guarantor 
of stability." Whereas Clinton met three times with Yeltsin, 
his rivals -- old communists and neorightists -- were put off 
with a few friendly words during the reception. 
  The other three presents were not intended for the leader 
but 
for the population. The first was dispatched long before the 
Moscow trip and merely approved by the Europeans at the NATO 
summit in Brussels. Its name is Partnership for Peace and it 
contains -- with Western approval -- a Russian right of veto 
concerning the military relationship between NATO and Moscow's 
former satellites in East Europe. The Partnership proposal is 
full of sweet words, and includes some attractive offers for the 
reform countries, but excludes membership in the alliance. As a 
result of noisy Russian warnings, the terms "maybe/sometime" and 
renewed discussion were used in connection with the questions as 
to who will be accepted when. 
  The second present consisted of Ukraine's nuclear weapons. 
The United States and Russia had already reached agreement on 
what Clinton described in the following way in Moscow: The 
"clear opportunity" has come "for us to be able to draft a new 
security structure for Europe." When Ukraine's President 
Kravchuk signed the treaty on elimination of the inherited 
Soviet nuclear missiles, he did that because of joint pressure 
by U.S. and Russian leaders. He was bribed by Clinton and 
blackmailed by Yeltsin: Ukraine will receive money from the 
United States -- $1 billion -- and Russia will resume its supply 
of oil and gas, which it has suspended systematically over the 
past few months. 
<H5>  New Structure </H5>
  The third present was more symbolic but still quite 
valuable. 
The two presidents announced that Russian and U.S. nuclear 
missiles will no longer be directed against one other but at the 
sea. This will not really decapitate the hydra-headed monster, 
because the United States can reprogram the targets within a few 
minutes, even while the missiles are in flight. Yet, symbolism 
is politics and, for this reason, Yeltsin was right when he 
stressed: "We have met to settle the final point of the last 
problem of the Cold War." 
  Thus, the Cold War has been declared as ended. What will 
follow now? In fact, in their enthusiasm and relief over 
America's return to the old continent, the Europeans have not 
really realized that Clinton showed them in a friendly way who 
dominates world politics. The Partnership for Peace concept was 
developed in Washington, and the Ukrainian nuclear potential was 
not brought closer to the scrapping sites by Kohl and Mitterrand 
but by Clinton and Yeltsin. If a "new security structure for 
Europe" is to be built, the architects will be the United States 
and Russia. For a country that "lost" the Cold War, this is an 
honor that would have made Talleyrand envious after 1815 and 
Adenauer after 1945. 
  However, can one blame Bill Clinton for that? He may indeed 
be influenced strongly by Russia's ardent supporter, Strobe 
Talbott, the new deputy secretary of state. However, who else 
could he have chosen as "hero of the continent?" France? De 
Gaulle has always been governing there, no matter whether under 
a socialist or conservative flag. The French made life a 
perfect hell for Clinton during the GATT talks. They seem to be 
dreaming of a neo-Napoleonic "continental system," designed not 
to fend off England but the United States. 
<H5>  "European Concert" </H5>
  What about Germany? Washington considers this country too 
unpredictable to assume the part of first violin. Germany is 
for free trade and for France; it is for Europe (Chancellor 
Kohl) and against Europe (Bavarian Minister President Stoiber); 
it is for NATO expansion (Defense Minister Ruehe) and against it 
(Foreign Minister Kinkel); for out-of-area missions (Christian 
Democratic Union) and against them (Social Democratic Party of 
Germany and -- occasionally -- the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany). German foreign policy is playing too many instruments 
-- it is trying to safeguard too many interests -- to be able to 
set the tone in the "concert of Europe" (as the club of major 
powers was called after 1815). Maybe it does not even want to, 
which need not necessarily be a sign of false modesty with a 
view to its nervous neighbors. 
  Thus, the U.S.-Russian junior partnership has been 
established partly for want of something better. Yet, it is 
also in Europe's interests if it is subjected to the right 
rules. Just as after 1945, at this point in time, Russia is 
Europe's most urgent problem. Yet, it is not the external 
strength of the giant but the internal weakness that makes the 
country dangerous. Moscow must not become a Weimar raised to 
the third power. 
  The conclusion is that Russia's fear of "isolation or 
encirclement" must not be fanned, as Chancellor Kohl demanded in 
his government statement on the NATO summit. Yet, as in 
medicine, the doctor's task is to determine the right dose here, 
too. A Russian right of veto over East Europe, that is a 
diplomatic "Brezhnev doctrine" with NATO approval as it were, 
was not the first wrong signal. It followed the West's roaring 
silence when Moscow restored its predominance in the neighboring 
Caucasus region. In spite of the required sensitivity on this 
issue, it is clear that Kohl was right when he added that 
"hegemonic efforts" are incompatible with partnership. 
  Clinton also gave the right answer -- rather in passing -- 
to 
the question of whether the West would do nothing -- as on the 
eve of World War II -- if an East European country were 
attacked. Clinton stressed that this lesson has not been 
forgotten, and thus he "doubts" that nothing would happen. A 
"Russian Weimar" would be a disaster, but so would a "Polish 
Weimar". Those who want to help Yeltsin because they are afraid 
of a weimarization must grant the same aid to Presidents Walesa, 
Havel, and Goncz. They are as close to our hearts, and even 
closer to our borders. 
  Sorting out the entire legacy of Soviet communism will be 
more difficult than its containment. Yet who ever claimed that 
foreign policy is easy? Bill Clinton has made a good start, and 
the Europeans should not be concerned about his star 
performance. Left to their own devices, they would have been as 
successful as in Bosnia.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) and his Spanish counterpart 
Julian Garcia Vargas have expressed their "determination" to 
force down the price of the planned European fighter. Following 
talks with Vargas, Ruehe told journalists in Bonn today that 
both sides agreed that further savings have to be made relating 
to the cost of the aircraft. 
  Ruehe confirmed that Germany and Spain will need a new 
fighter in the year 2002. The estimated price of each aircraft 
is now about 102 million German marks. This is "still too 
high," Ruehe said. Alongside Germany and Spain, the fighter is 
also being developed by Italy and France. Vargas stressed that 
the aircraft must also be competitive on the world market. 
  According to the ministers, a Spanish armored brigade will 
be 
the first Spanish unit ever to take part in a Eurocorps exercise 
this year. The ministers also talked about the Partnership for 
Peace concept adopted by NATO with the Central and East European 
countries and the CIS states. In this regard, Ruehe referred to 
the Bundeswehr maneuver planned with Poland and Denmark in the 
Baltic Sea, while Vargas talked of Spain's intensive contacts 
with Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria. [passage

  [Text] Spanish Defense Minister [Julian] Garcia Vargas, has 
been, or rather is, in Germany today and he has been talking 
with his German counterpart precisely about the situation in the 
former Yugoslavia. The Spanish Government has expressed its 
support for carrying out actions in the area to serve as a 
warning, such as selective strikes against the Serb aggressors. 
Also on the defense minister's agenda: the details of Spain's 
joining of the Eurocorps. Our correspondent in Berlin, Aurora 
Minguez, has the details. Good afternoon. 
  [Minguez] Good afternoon. The press conference has just 
ended here at the German Defense Ministry building and Julian 
Garcia Vargas has just told RNE that he is opposed to the 
withdrawal of the blue helmets stationed in Yugoslavia, although 
he does favor the idea of reducing contingents. 
  [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] That would mean that a 
particular country could leave for good or temporarily, with the 
system of rotation operating as one supposes will happen, and 
concentrating the remaining blue helmets in certain zones where 
they were essential -- in Sarajevo, of course -- but, at the 
same time, giving a very clear indication to all the parties 
that the current situation cannot continue, and therefore that 
presence may be reduced drastically or, in certain cases as in 
the case of a particular country, may disappear. [end recording] 
  [Minguez] The Spanish defense minister also expressed 
support 
for selective strikes on the Bosnian city of Tuzla in order to 
break the Serb siege and thus allow humanitarian aid to reach 
the civilian population, which is protected -- on paper -- by 
the UN, which considers this Muslim enclave an international 
protection zone. 
  Yugoslavia was one of the topics in the talks between Garcia 
Vargas and his German opposite number, Volker Ruehe, but it was 
not the only one. The two ministers expressed their support for 
continuing to make a cheap version of the European fighter 
aircraft and their support for NATO opening up to the countries 
of East Europe, with whom joint military manoeuvres are in fact 
going to be carried out this year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roman Herzog, president of the </F>
Constitutional Court and presidential candidate of the CDU/CSU, 
in Wildhagen by Ulrich Wickert in Hamburg -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Wickert] Good evening, Mr. Herzog. 
  [Herzog] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. 
  [Wickert] Mr. Herzog, you have now been nominated as 
presidential candidate by the Presidium of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]. Will you remain president of the 
Constitutional Court during the election campaign? 
  [Herzog] There is no other way. Originally, I believed that 
I might apply for a suspension from my office, but it is not 
possible for legal reasons. I understand that, because the 
legislator is interested in the efficiency of the court, and 
because the basic right to recourse to the Constitutional Court 
must be ensured. I could either relinquish the office totally, 
which I am not willing to do and for which I see no reason, or I 
could take the required steps if the question arises whether a 
judge can participate in certain procedures or not, according to 
Section 19 of the Law on the Constitutional Court. I will 
choose the second option, and it is now up to the First Senate 
of the Constitutional Court to make a decision as to what I am 
supposed to do during my candidacy. 
  [Wickert] Mr. Herzog, you raised the question of the 
majority situation at the closed session of the CDU Presidium 
this morning. What was the answer? 
  [Herzog] What I wanted to do was to avoid this difficult 
procedure, which is also a burden for my colleagues at the 
Constitutional Court, if it is clear from the outset that my 
candidacy for the presidential office does not stand any chance 
of success. Thus, unanimous approval by the CDU and Christian 
Social Union [CSU] had to be ensured. I raised this question, 
and it was discussed. The result of a secret vote in the CDU 
Executive Committee was completely satisfactory for me. 
  [Wickert] There was one opposing vote and one abstention. 
These votes may have been cast by East German members. Mr. 
Heitmann, your predecessor as presidential candidate, stated 
that he would have liked a different candidate instead of Mr. 
Herzog because he believes that a candidate from the east would 
be better. 
  [Herzog] One can have different opinions on this issue. I 
understand Mr. Heitmann's position very well. Yet, I ask you to 
take into consideration that I have not competed against any 
other candidate. I have no influence on this situation. 
  [Wickert] You stated that you do not want to be elected with 
the votes of extremist parties. You were both referring to 
right-wing parties and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. 
  [Herzog] Yes, exactly. The danger that the PDS might vote 
for me is probably relatively small. 
  [Wickert] Acting President von Weizsaecker has moved his 
office to Berlin. He gave the New Year reception for the 
diplomatic corps in Berlin. Will you also move to Berlin? 
  [Herzog] Naturally I must point out that I am not the final 
candidate of the CDU/CSU at this point, and I have not yet been 
elected president. However, one thing is absolutely clear: I 
began my career in Berlin, and it would be a great honor for me 
to end it in Berlin. 
  [Wickert] Do you believe that direct election of the federal 
president might be useful? 
  [Herzog] Mr. Wickert, I have a problem here. I once 
expressed my view on this issue, and I was publicly rebuked for 
it. I was accused of having overstepped my powers as president 
of the Constitutional Court. Therefore, I will only say that 
direct election makes sense if far-reaching powers are linked 
with the president's office. One should discuss more than just 
the election procedure. 
  [Wickert] You, yourself, said that the federal president 
cannot do very much, that he can only talk a great deal. The 
acting president occasionally used his speeches to sharply 
criticize the parties. Will you continue this tradition? 
  [Herzog] I do not want to tell you now what topics I would 
address as president. But I do not believe that giving speeches 
is the only thing a president can do. Richard von Weizsaecker 
and his predecessors have made that clear. However, there is no 
doubt that delivering speeches is one of the president's main 
tasks. Just think of the need to explain the state and our 
constitution to the citizens time and again in a simple but 
emphatic way. 
  [Wickert] Mr, Herzog, thank you very much. 
  [Herzog] You are welcome.

  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- An extraordinary 
party congress of the right-wing extremist National Democratic 
Party of Germany [Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands] 
(NPD) apparently is to be held in the town of Ehringshausen (in 
Lahn-Dill rural district) in Hesse. This emerges from a letter 
in DDP/ADN's possession from the NPD party executive to party 
members dated 10 January. According to the letter, the congress 
is to begin at 1000 in the Volkshalle in Ehringshausen. 
  The Lahn-Dill branch of the DGB [German Trade Union 
Federation] has already announced a counterdemonstration and 
rally, permits for which have already been applied for and 
approved, according to a spokesman. The counterdemonstrators 
intend to gather at 0900 at Ehringshausen station. 
  The police in Giessen also expect the party congress to go 
ahead in Ehringhausen, but do not rule out that the meeting may 
be held elsewhere. The NPD had named various places in 
Thuringia and Hesse during the run-up to the congress, 
apparently in order to confuse the counterdemonstrators. 
Giessen police said they would be responding flexibly. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Siegmar Schelling and Romanus Otte: "SPD Offers </F>
To Cooperate With CDU/CSU"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Free Democratic Party [FDP] was sharply 
criticized on 8 January for its position on the so-called great 
bugging campaign. The liberals alone are against the other 
large political parties. The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] intends to use the situation politically for a common 
action with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU]. 
  The CDU, the CSU, and the SPD accused the liberals of 
adopting an "incomprehensible obstructive stance." CDU Interior 
Minister Manfred Kanther had made far-reaching concessions to 
the FDP leadership, which continues to strictly reject the 
bugging campaign by citing a resolution adopted at its party 
congress in Muenster in June 1993. He had suggested to confine 
"electronic surveillance of private homes" to serious, 
punishable offenses detailed in a catalogue. A judge would have 
the authority to order a bugging operation; in urgent cases, a 
public prosecutor would order such operation, which would then 
have to be authorized by a judge ex post facto. 
  At the FDP's Epiphany meeting in Stuttgart, party chief 
Klaus 
Kinkel and Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
strictly rejected Kanther's initiative. 
  Thereupon, Bavarian chief of government, CSU Vice Chairman 
Edmund Stoiber, sharply attacked the liberals on 8 January. He 
said that by his compromise proposal, Kanther had "taken all 
objections regarding the use of electronic means into account" 
as far as possible, without jeopardizing the effectiveness of 
this instrument against organized crime. Stoiber told WELT AM 
SONNTAG: "Therefore I do not have the slightest understanding 
for the FDP leadership sticking to its obstructive position and 
even rejecting this compromise. Our people must not be 
protected against an overly powerful state, as Kinkel and 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger are trying to make people believe, 
but against crime that is technically extremely well-equipped 
and represents a huge financial power." 
  Commenting on the state of the Bonn coalition, Stoiber said 
that it was becoming increasingly difficult to convince German 
citizens "that urgently necessary and sound solutions do not 
come about out of regard for the liberal coalition partner, even 
though there are parliamentary majorities for them with the SPD." 
  In a talk with WELT AM SONNTAG, SPD Parliamentary Manager 
Peter Struck called Kanther's compromise proposal "an adequate 
basis for talks in the Bundestag committees." However, the SPD 
would only accept an amendment to Basic Law Article 13 
(inviolability of apartments), "if, at the same time, Article 14 
(property, right of succession, and expropriation) is amended." 
The problem is under what conditions profits from criminal 
activities could be confiscated. "The SPD advocates a reversal 
of the burden of proof. This is a linkage for us," said Struck. 
  The SPD politician added that, if Kanther mustered the 
courage, he should "submit a draft law without delay, including 
the necessary legal amendments to the Code of Criminal 
Procedure." The SPD would, however, not agree to Kanther's 
proposal that, in urgent cases, a public prosecutor could 
authorize electronic-listening measures. 
  Struck: "I think understanding between the CDU and SPD is 
possible if the CDU is ready to amend Basic Law Article 14 as 
well. The CDU and SPD will then, in any case, have a two-third 
majority." 
  The CDU does not understand the liberals' position either. 
Deputy floor leader Johannes Gerster told WELT AM SONNTAG that 
it was "regrettable" that the FDP leadership "continues to 
reject" the bugging campaign, "despite increasing criticism from 
its party grassroots and contrary to the advice given by almost 
all experts." 
  Gerster asked whether the FDP really intended to declare the 
leadership levels of organized crime, which can hardly be 
covered by the instruments of investigation used in the past, 
"areas exempt from investigation." Gerster called upon the FDP 
to study Kanther's proposals realistically, and not to "put them 
aside with a shrug," as party chief Kinkel did in Stuttgart. 
He, Gerster, had "no idea" how the FDP was going to make 
internal security "an offensive subject" in the upcoming 
election campaigns, "while continuing to reject the introduction 
of important instruments of investigation to combat dangerous 
crime."

<F P=106> [Report by Bela Anda and Kai Diekmann: "Was He the Super </F>
Spy?"] 
  [Text] Whenever something happened in Bonn, he was 
present, and he knew all the state secrets -- Karl Wienand (67), 
Social Democratic Party [SPD] floor leader from 1967 through 
1974, is suspected of having worked not only for the Stasi but 
also for the KGB. Wienand was questioned all day yesterday in 
the Federal Prosecutor General's Office in Karlsruhe. The SPD 
politician continues to reject strictly all charges. According 
to information obtained by BILD, a new witness has incriminated 
Wienand so seriously that the federal prosecutor general will 
formally indict him next week. If the grave suspicion were to 
be confirmed, the Wienand case would be the greatest case of 
treason in the Federal Republic's history. 
  It was for years a great mystery in Bonn. Who is the super 
spy? Defectors from the East had provided leads time and again. 
Stasi Chief Markus Wolf also made vague indications following 
the change. 
  Now the formerly powerful SPD politician, Karl Wienand, is 
in 
the focus. He was in the center of power more than anyone else 
and was Herbert Wehner's closest confidant. Hardly anything 
happened in Bonn without him. 
  The question: Did he have secret contacts with the East in 
order to be of use to the people in both German states? Or what? 
  Karl Wienand was talked about time and time again -- 
sometimes for having received money as adviser for the 
"Paninternational" airliner, sometimes in connection with the 
bribery affair around Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Deputy 
Julius Steiner, who, in the no-confidence vote against Willy 
Brandt, voted for the SPD chancellor for 50,000 German marks. 
  What does Karl Wienand have to do with the Stasi? 
  Since August 1993, the federal public prosecutor general has 
investigated the SPD politician because of suspected 
"intelligence activities." For a salary of 10,000 German marks 
per month, he allegedly collaborated with the Stasi. The Stasi 
kept him under the cover name of "Streit." This is what 
Wienand's former control officer, Stasi captain Alfred Voelkel 
(cover name "Krueger"), claims. 
  Having been confronted with Wienand, the Stasi man withdrew 
his testimony. Wienand also disputed all charges. 
  According to information obtained by BILD, another former 
Stasi officer has now spilled the beans and reiterated the 
espionage charges against Wienand. The investigations are 
completed. Wienand will be indicted next week. 
  How important was Wienand for the Stasi? 
  On behalf of Herbert Wehner, Wienand held strictly secret 
talks with the GDR leadership in 1970 to establish "a 
continuous, unofficial political contact, in addition to the 
official negotiations." 
  In a secret Stasi document, it says: "Streit (alias Wienand) 
repeatedly stressed the absolute confidentiality, because 
otherwise, the SPD leadership would get into a lot of trouble." 
Nor must the Free Democratic Party [FDP] as a coalition partner 
"be informed under any circumstances." 
  What did Wienand have to do with the KGB? 
  According to information obtained by BILD, Valentin Falin, 
the former Soviet Ambassador to Bonn, met with Willy Brandt in 
the latter's Bonn office in the second half of March 1992. 
According to confidants, Falin hinted that Karl Wienand was a 
KGB agent. 
  Brandt informed the Federal Intelligence Service in 
Munich-Pullach. 
  Asked by BILD, former Ambassador Falin denied the meeting 
with Brandt: "There was never a talk with Brand on any Wienand 
contacts with the KGB." 
  What is strange, however, is that, asked by BILD, Brandt's 
widow, Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt, remembered the Falin-Brandt 
meeting in the second half of March 1992 very clearly....

<F P=106> [Report signed "eli": "Opposition and FDP Opposed To </F>
Schaeuble Proposal"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- There is little inclination in the 
opposition and the Free Democratic Party [FDP] as a government 
party to follow Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU] floor leader Wolfgang Schaeuble's move for an 
expansion of the Bundeswehr mission. In a Bundestag debate, 
requested by the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], only 
CDU/CSU speakers were ready to advocate, like Schaeuble, the 
idea of using the Armed Forces for missions at home. As far as 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] was concerned, 
ostentatiously no leading party or group members took the floor 
in the debate. FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer said he did 
not see a need for decision on the matter. Schaeuble himself did 
not take part in the debate, because he had to attend a CDU 
Presidium meeting. 
  On behalf of the CDU, Minister in the Chancellor's Office 
Friedrich Bohl cautiously supported Schaeuble. He said that 
under certain and precisely defined conditions, an internal 
mission of the Armed Forces could make sense. Bohl criticized 
the "emotional discussion" and stressed that one certainly could 
discuss the "idea of rejecting the proposal," but he did not 
understand why "people should come with a big hammer." Under 
the impression of epochal changes, the option of a Bundeswehr 
mission inside the country's borders must be examined. 
  Rupert Scholz, a constitutional expert and former defense 
minister (CDU), and Johannes Gerster, deputy CDU/CSU floor 
leader, expressed the most favorable opinions on Schaeuble's 
proposal. Scholz said that the term of external security had 
changed; it now also included migration movements, terrorism, 
and ecological situations. Security policy and the Bundeswehr 
mandate had to be reoriented to this new definition. Gerster 
said the Bundeswehr should defend the borders. 
  FDP Secretary-General Hoyer said he was not happy with the 
discussion. He stressed that "at least since the emergency laws 
became effective, clarity has been created on the issue of 
Bundeswehr missions at home," and stated categorically: "There 
is no need for decision." Hoyer said it was true that 
absolutely new circumstances could require new decisions, but he 
did not see that this also required a constitutional amendment. 
The Bundeswehr could already help in disasters. Hoyer warned 
that the debate, touched off by Schaeuble, would be 
counterproductive because it burdened the discussion on an 
amendment to the Basic Law for out-of-area missions. In 
addition, there was the danger that the Bundeswehr's anchoring 
in society and the citizens' trust in the armed forces could 
suffer harm. Both were based on the fact that the Bundeswehr 
averted dangers from outside and did not appear as a power 
protecting law and order at home. FDP deputy Juergen Koppelin 
said that for the liberals, Schaeuble's proposal amounted to an 
"erosion of the constitution." 
  SPD politician Erwin Horn said that "those who want such 
missions want a different republic." Horn called Schaeuble's 
proposals absurd, and insinuated that for tactical 
considerations, Schaeuble wanted to sacrifice the consensus 
among the political parties. He added that even Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe had rejected the proposals. One could not 
call upon the citizens to respect the constitution, and at the 
same time deal with the Basic Law as if it were a tear-off 
calendar.

  [Text] Berlin (ADN-WDO) [ADN business service] -- A draft 
law was adopted by the German cabinet today to improve 
cooperation between the German and Russian customs authorities. 
This means that the treaty of 16 December 1992 concluded 
between the Federal Republic and the Russian Federation has been 
translated into domestic law. It provides for the two customs 
authorities to give each other mutual support to prevent, 
investigate, and pursue violations of customs legislation 
between the two states. 
  Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the treaty is intended to 
ensure that customs dues and other import and export payments 
were levied. Also, the customs authorities are to step up their 
cooperation in combating the smuggling of drugs, arms, and 
nuclear material, as well as the smuggling of high-tax goods. 
Waigel said the translation of the treaty into domestic law 
would form the basis for more effective monitoring of 
cross-border smuggling, which had risen sharply as a result of 
the political changes in Central and East Europe. 
Irregularities and offenses could also be combatted more 
effectively. This was also in the interests of the economy, 
Waigel stressed, because illegal imports and exports led to 
distortions in competition.

<F P=106> [Report signed "hen": "Rexrodt Announces Economic and </F>
Monetary Policy Initiatives"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- According to Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt, the Federal Government plans to work out a number of 
economic and monetary policy priorities by next autumn and to 
introduce measures to put them into practice as much as 
possible. Next week, a program will be presented that will 
suggest improvements in the fields of medium-size businesses, 
the labor market, and deregulation. The government will also 
set out details of the fiscal policy it considers necessary to 
safeguard Germany as a business location over the next few 
years, Rexrodt told journalists in Bonn. 
  According to the economics minister, the program, which was 
agreed upon within the coalition at the beginning of the week, 
is not a "traditional economic policy program," as the 
largest-ever economic policy program currently is being enforced 
in eastern Germany. The 1994 perspectives of up to 1.5-percent 
growth, as described in the [government's] draft Annual Economic 
Report, do not justify a large-scale anticyclical program. 
There is no "purposeful optimism" in the 1994 Annual Economic 
Report, Rexrodt said. The improved economic situation abroad, 
especially in the neighboring European countries, clearly shows 
this. But still, everything must be done to improve the 
framework conditions for a long-term decline in unemployment 
figures in Germany. 
  He said that one of his top priorities during this 
legislative period is to strengthen confidence in the 
government's economic and monetary policy by consistently 
consolidating public funds. This is an objective that will also 
be worked on in close cooperation with the economics and finance 
ministers. This Monday [17 January], he, Rexrodt, wants to 
contribute his share to enabling Finance Minister Theo Waigel to 
cut expenses by 5 billion German marks [DM], as laid down by the 
budget committee. In spite of the need to economize, the 
coalition is determined to enforce measures stimulating the 
economy, as proposed in his Report on Germany as a Business 
Location dated August 1993, Rexrodt said. Various measures to 
promote medium-size businesses are being planned. By way of 
example, the minister mentioned the plan to reactivate the 
program on promoting capital resources in the old laender, 
promoting vocational training through low-interest loans, as 
well as more liberal regulations for practicing various 
professions. 
  Rexrodt also announced new initiatives to privatize public 
services, as well as deregulation. As an outstanding example, 
he mentioned the abolition of demarcation agreements in the 
German power supply industry. Yet, this initiative will only be 
successful if laender and municipalities stop resisting the 
ensuing stimulation of competition between power suppliers. 
  Rexrodt advocated "radical rethinking" in matters concerning 
labor policy. This includes maintaining the gaps between wages 
and introducing a low-wage sector. Germany can no longer afford 
to exclude entire groups of the population from the labor market 
by laying down wages that are too high. All opportunities for 
additional employment must, therefore, be explored. This 
includes jobs in private households that must no longer be done 
illicitly. By fully taking into account wages paid and their 
tax-reducing effects, in the end, this policy will pay for 
itself by means of additional jobs and higher social insurance 
contributions, Rexrodt said. 
  The economics minister also announced that the Federal 
Government will present a fiscal policy concept for the next 
parliamentary term by mid-1994. In addition to measures 
simplifying taxes, this will include a reduction of 
nonprofit-linked taxes, a reduction of taxes on profits, a 
return of trade tax under a municipal tax reform, as well as 
abolishing income tax on wages and salaries for 
subsistence-level incomes.

<F P=106> [Report signed "HH": "Coalition In Dispute Over Finances"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The disputes in Bonn's coalition over 
monetary and fiscal policy are getting worse. Following 
Economics Minister Rexrodt's announcement that he plans to cut 
taxes during the next parliamentary term, Finance Minister 
Waigel said that a certain period of time had to pass before 
taxes could be cut. He rejected making a comment on the 
expected duration of the solidarity surcharge. He said it is 
"dishonest" to promise its abolition for 1996, one year after 
reintroducing it. 
  According to its monetary policy spokesman, Poss, the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany Bundestag group considers the 
Rexrodt statement to be a "clumsy election campaign promise." 
He said Rexrodt is not even taken seriously within the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. The FDP Bundestag group's 
economic policy spokesman, Graf Lambsdorff, had warned against a 
new hole in the 1994 budget and demanded that Waigel presents a 
supplementary budget. Waigel's spokesman referred to the 
positive budget balance in 1993 and warned against the "nonsense 
of such scaremongering as we have heard from the FDP every time 
over the past few years." 
  Critics of the monetary policy were supplied with arguments 
by the Finance Ministry's Scientific Advisory Board. In an 
expert opinion it demands "a fundamental rethinking in monetary 
policy." Taking housing, the hard coal policy, and compulsory 
pension insurance as examples, it shows how "considerable gains 
in efficiency" could be achieved by privatizing and 
rationalizing. 
  It calls the hard coal subsidy "a particularly drastic 
example of government control that completely neglects economic 
efficiency and is enormously expensive in terms of taxes." It 
recommends to replace the "existing maze of subsidies by a 
uniform premium that is linked exclusively to production."

<F P=106> [Interview with Gerhard Schroeder, Lower Saxony's minister </F>
president, by Reinhard Hesse; place and date not given: "`Most 
Superfluous'"] 
  [Text] [Hesse] In Spring 1993, you said that submarines 
for Taiwan should be built at shipyards in Lower Saxony to 
preserve jobs. The current discussion about relaxing arms 
export guidelines should suit you very well. 
  [Schroeder] I am definitely the wrong person to talk to 
about this matter. I have never called for relaxing arms export 
guidelines. In my opinion, the current discussion is most 
superfluous. If statistics are right, Germany ranks third among 
arms exporters. The existing law says that the Federal Security 
Council has to examine whether exceptions should be made in 
individual cases -- and we are only talking about arms exports 
outside NATO. Changing this procedure would be politically 
wrong and economically unnecessary. 
  [Hesse] But it sounded quite different before. Or did we 
misunderstand your interventions? 
  [Schroeder] I am one of the people who occasionally speak 
out for utilizing the full resources of the existing arms 
industry. However, I am opposed to misunderstanding arms 
production as a means of economic control. You can see the 
results of this approach in Bavaria: I get the impression that 
Franz Josef Strauss' successors would rather not have inherited 
the military-industrial structures with which the late 
minister-president attempted his Bavarian economic miracle. 
  [Hesse] And yet, in connection with closing down the 
Daimler-Benz daughter company Dasa, you demanded that the 
Eurofighter project be reassessed, a project that had been 
rejected by the Social Democratic Party of Germany for years. 
  [Schroeder] I said that one must understand the Bavarian 
minister-president demanding that production be set out and 
predictable. I never said that this should mean establishing 
new resources. This would be very problematic. Just how 
problematic this would be, can be seen in the United States at 
the moment: They have even more excess resources in the arms 
industry, and thus greater problems. 
  [Hesse] Meanwhile, Daimler-Benz Chief Edzard Reuter has 
threatened that he would close down more resources at the 
Lemwerder Dasa works, or even transfer the entire production 
abroad, unless the export guidelines are relaxed. Could you be 
blackmailed into something there? 
  [Schroeder] Leaving the fuss aside, what Reuter demands are 
clear conditions. But these can only be had in Bonn. 
  [Hesse] Those advocating a more offensive arms export policy 
argue that Germany would not be sufficiently able to act in 
foreign policy matters otherwise. 
  [Schroeder] I cannot follow this line. On the contrary: It 
would make sense to apply the obviously right, peace-oriented 
German regulations to all of Europe. Following the experience 
of two World Wars instigated by Germany, it would be appropriate 
for Germany to lead a movement for arms export control. 
  [Hesse] Have you -- for the sake of jobs in our country -- 
completely abandoned the idea of converting arms production into 
civilian production? 
  [Schroeder] Nonsense. Of course, I am in favor of 
conversion. But this is a medium- to long-term objective. It is 
of no use in the short term, if existing resources are not 
utilized, as is the case in Lemwerder. 
  [Hesse] Does this mean: Schroeder is against arms exports, 
but in favor of armament if it secures jobs? 
  [Schroeder] No. Schroeder is in favor of facts that can be 
kept, that one can rely on. Lemwerder has nothing to do with 
exports. Helmut Kohl recently told the minister presidents of 
the laender that he is opposed to arms exports as an instrument 
of economic policy. If this now becomes a topic in the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU], I wonder whether there are 
people within the CDU who are out to get Kohl. 
  [Hesse] But your submarines for Taiwan would not have been 
compatible with German export guidelines, either. 
  [Schroeder] That is wrong. Such a contract would have been 
in line with the guidelines. The Federal Security Council made 
a different decision in this matter because it thought it had to 
make concessions to the government of the People's Republic of 
China. Shortly afterwards, supplying warships to Indonesia did 
not pose any problem. This means, it is a question of specific 
political decisions. It does not require any legal changes.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- Metallgesellschaft [a 
major German metals and mining group], which was threatened with 
bankruptcy and has a work force of 58,000, has been saved at the 
last minute. The company announced in Frankfurt am Main this 
evening that representatives of the 120 or so creditor banks 
agreed to a modified rescue package with a few reservations 
after over 10 hours of negotiations. Under the agreement, 
Metallgesellschaft will receive new equity capital totalling 
around 2.7 billion German marks [DM] and credits worth DM700 
million. 
  Kajo Neukirchen, the chairman of the managing board of 
Metallgesellschaft, said that with the support of the banks, 
Metallgesellschaft was now in a position for new horizons to be 
opened for the company. "We are now able to devote ourselves 
fully to the tasks before us," he said. 
  Up until yesterday the shareholding banks Deutsche Bank and 
Dresdner Bank had been unable to obtain approval for the rescue 
package from the other banks. The rescue plan for 
Metallgesellschaft, which was submitted last week, provided for 
total aid worth DM3.4 billion. The company went into the red as 
a result of risky oil deals and mismanagement. French and 
American banks had previously rejected the plan and called for 
greater involvement by Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Daimler 
Benz, Kuwait, and Allianz, the five principle shareholders. The 
latter are evidently now prepared to raise their previous share 
of 68 percent of the financial aid being offered.

  [Text] Ankara -- In his assessment of Greek oil prospecting 
around Thasos Island, President Suleyman Demirel warned: 
"Problems will arise if Greece acts like `this is my sea, my 
lake' with regard to the Aegean." 
  Indicating that for Greece to try to do something in a sea 
in 
which Turkey has interests would lead to problems, President 
Demirel said: "When I say these things, they immediately get 
offended. I am not the one creating tension. I merely want all 
the problems to be resolved peacefully." 
  Indicating that Greece has nothing to be gained in the 
present situation by fomenting and escalating a crisis with 
Turkey, the president said: "You are not always at fault in a 
traffic accident. You might be a very good driver, but someone 
might come along and collide with you." 
  When reminded that he brought Prime Minister Ciller into 
politics, Demirel said he cannot comment on the prime minister's 
statements and views and added: "Whether I defend or criticize 
them, it will still open the way to various speculations. I am 
not an inspector of the prime minister; I too am a mere voting 
citizen."

  [Text] Ankara -- National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan 
said Greece's initiative to search for oil off Thasos Island is 
a "bluff" and "madness." Golhan stated that this madness will 
be considered as a cause for war. 
  In a statement to YENI GUNAYDIN on the Greek initiative to 
search for oil in the disputed waters of the Aegean, National 
Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan recalled that Greece made a 
similar attempt in 1987 and then gave it up when Turkey declared 
it would consider such a move as a cause for war. Indicating 
that it would be very difficult for Greece to start searching 
for oil, Golhan said: "This is a bluff and madness." 
  Indicating that the declaration of sovereignty over these 
waters will follow once Greece starts searching for oil in the 
disputed waters, Golhan said: "In such a case, there can be no 
question of Turkey retreating from its 1987 position." In 
saying this, he implied that such an initiative would again be 
considered a cause for war. 
  Stating that the developments are being closely watched, 
Golhan said in the case of any operation, the National Security 
Council will meet to determine the necessary strategies and 
every political and military initiative will be undertaken. 
<H5>  Foreign Ministry: "There Is No Tension" </H5>
  On the other hand, the Foreign Ministry stated that reports 
to the effect that Greece's oil prospecting activities in the 
Aegean have increased tension are not correct. 
  Deputy Spokesman of the Foreign Ministry Ferhat Ataman said 
that, from Turkey's point of view, there is no obstacle to 
Greece's searching for oil within its own 6-mile territorial 
waters in the Aegean.

  [Text] Istanbul -- It has been learned that a month ago 
Turkey sent 5,000 military personnel to Azerbaijan under the 
supervision of the General Staff. Active combat elements as 
well as military specialists were among the 5,000. It was 
reported that the military personnel assigned by Turkey have 
been distributed on the fronts. It was also learned that, in 
tandem with the counterattack launched by the Azerbaijani Army, 
three commando battalions of the Ground Forces have been 
deployed on the borders with Armenia. 
  It is being reported that the Azerbaijani units have had 
successful military operations over the last 10 days. It is 
being claimed that the specialists and personnel sent from 
Turkey had a role in the success of the Azerbaijani units on the 
Fizulinskiy, Mardakertskiy, Goradiz, and Agdamskiy fronts. 
  When Geydar Aliyev first came to power in Azerbaijan, the 
services of the Turkish personnel were discontinued, and 
subsequently some of them had returned to Turkey. However, new 
personnel were dispatched to Azerbaijan following the resolution 
of differences with the Aliyev administration. It was claimed 
at the time that most of the Special Warfare elements sent to 
Azerbaijan to help the People's Front gain power were 
pro-Turkes. When Aliyev came to power, Nationalist Action Party 
leader Alparslan Turkes' control over Azerbaijan collapsed and 
his son Tugrul Turkes had no other choice but to return to 
Turkey. 
<H5>  Baku Summit To Take Place 21-22 January </H5>
  The Azerbaijani scientists and reporters organized a news 
conference on the latest situation in Azerbaijan at the 
Azerbaijani Consulate in Istanbul. Professor Vilayet Muhtaroglu 
said the Azerbaijani National Army has won huge victories and it 
is on the verge of retaking Fizuli. 
  Muhtaroglu said the 21-22 January [Turkic states] summit in 
Baku will discuss the Turkic world's problems and ways to 
establish financial, political, and economic ties among them. 
  It was noted that the Baku summit, which will be attended by 
Suleyman Demirel and high level representatives of the Turkic 
states, will be a very important one.

<F P=106> [Gursel Balci video report from Agri Mountain region] </F>
  [Text] In operations launched five days ago, war planes 
bombed terrorist targets in the northern section of Agri 
Mountain. Yesterday, security forces engaged a group of 150 
terrorists in a clash in the Korugan-(?Kislagi) region. The 
area harboring the terrorists was encircled by two battalions 
and subjected to intense artillery and mortar fire. Cobra 
helicopters were also used. The terrorists, who sustained heavy 
casualties, are taking advantage of the 2-meter high snow and 
mountainous terrain and carrying their dead and wounded to 
Kupgolu area. 
  Today, security forces began their search operations in the 
area of the fighting. During the operations, acting on 
information that a group of terrorists descended from Agri 
Mountain into the surrounding villages, security forces searched 
the villages located between the mountain and Armenia. A total 
of 68 persons -- eight organization members, 28 abettors, and 32 
wanted suspects -- were captured during the searches. With 
these people, security forces seized three Kalashnikov rifles 
and large quantities of unlicensed weapons and rounds of 
ammunition.

Cobra helicopters are participating in the operations when the 
weather permits. The bodies of 28 terrorists were found during 
searches conducted following the clashes between the security 
forces and the terrorists in the Korugan-Kislagi region on 
Thursday [13 January]. 
  Furthermore, it has been determined that at least 20 of the 
some 100 terrorists who were under fire yesterday night have 
been killed, and many have been injured. Based on the blood and 
other evidence, it has also been determined that many injured 
were taken to other regions of the mountain. 
  A terrorist shelter was discovered during an intense 
operation in the northern peaks of Agri Mountain. Various 
equipment, a generator, a television, a video machine, a camera, 
lighting and medical equipment, and tonnes of foodstuffs were 
found in the shelter, which has two separate entrances. It was, 
however, impossible to film due to the heavy fog around the 
mountain. Operations are continuing in the region.

  [Text] Ankara, Jan 14 (AA) -- Chief commander of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), General George A. Joulwan 
who is officially in Turkey visited Defense Minister Mehmet 
Golhan on Friday [14 January]. 
  Golhan during the visit said NATO has hesitations after the 
end of Cold War, adding that countries which were formed after 
the splitting of Soviet Union and Yugoslavia still could not 
reach stability. 
  Golhan said ideological clashes have turned to ethnic 
clashes 
nowadays and NATO has to provide peace at this stage with its 
experience in planning, education and mass military activities. 
  He said Turkey did its best to provide peace and abided by 
the NATO's resolutions so far adding NATO is the most powerful 
security organization in Europe. 
  Golhan said Turkey aimed at being a full member of Western 
European Union and seeks support from its friends on the issue. 
  Joulwan said Turkey has a strategic importance in the region 
adding that `partnership for peace' initiation which was adopted 
in NATO summit was to create solidarity and a secure atmosphere 
among world's countries. 
  Joulwan said Turkey could play an important role to provide 
stability in the region and thanked Turkey for its contributions 
to the efforts of preserving peace.

  [Text] The question as to whether or not NATO should place 
Eastern Europe under its protection was the most important 
subject on the agenda of the NATO summit. Could the countries 
in Eastern Europe become NATO members? 
  The main aspect of that question was either ignored or 
pushed 
aside... Considering the fact that NATO is a defense alliance, 
it has to defend its members. However, against which enemy will 
it do so? 
  Obviously, the agreement for the North Atlantic alliance 
clearly defined the enemy when it was first drawn up. However, 
it is common knowledge that many changes have taken place since 
then. The effort that was made to define the new enemy after 
the Soviet Union disintegrated failed to yield results. The 
Statements on the situation by the NATO secretary general have 
not sufficiently clarified the situation. It is a fact that a 
state of confusion still exists in NATO. 
  Undoubtedly, the desire of the countries in Eastern Europe 
to 
join NATO to establish security against Russia for themselves in 
today's uncertain world has created a two-sided problem. On the 
one hand, Washington deemed it useful to have NATO under its 
hand; on the other hand, it felt the need to consider the 
problems that may be created if NATO moved to place the 
countries in Eastern Europe under its protection against Russia. 
A middle way had to be found. Consequently, the concept of a 
Partnership for Peace was proposed. It opened NATO's door to the 
countries in Eastern Europe. A decision was adopted in Brussels 
to begin a new process that will eventually allow those 
countries to become NATO members. 
  How would Russia react to that state of affairs, however? In 
a statement to CUMHURIYET, Albert Chernyshev, Russians 
ambassador to Turkey, replied as follows: "We do not want the 
new NATO structure. If a new security system is to be drawn up 
for Europe, then we should do it together. In principle, the 
CIS may adopt a firm approach if NATO is enlarged." 
  Considering the matter from the point of view of 
international politics, Ambassador Chernyshev may be described 
as justified. That is because the countries in Eastern Europe 
have been observed to prepare to join the restructured NATO 
against Russia. 
  The point that has drawn Turkey's attention is this: 
Chernyshev has mentioned the CIS as a force to counter NATO. 
Obviously, he regards Russia as being integrated with the 
republics in Central Asia. How the Turkic republics in Central 
Asia will react to his opinion is an interesting question. 
  It seems that the NATO summit in Brussels will make a 
serious 
blunder while trying to rectify the situation. Obviously, the 
main reason for that is NATO's inability to define the new 
enemy. The Western world headed by the United States seems to 
have found itself confronted with a problem of principle in the 
"new world order." Washington used the UN organization and the 
UN Security Council in the Gulf War. However, neither that 
organization nor NATO have been effective in Bosnia. 
  Considering all that, will NATO be the military force in the 
new world order? It is a fact that NATO regarded the Soviet 
Union as an enemy force in the past. Will it regard the CIS in 
the same way now? Many questions can be asked on that subject. 
However, it is a fact that the participants in the NATO summit 
did not represent the entire world. Not only does it not 
represent the entire world, NATO has been unable to represent 
all of Europe. That is because its door to Eastern Europe is 
neither open nor closed. Furthermore, Europe's borders cannot 
be drawn up without Russia being included in the process.

  [Text] Ankara -- Indicating that NATO is an antiquated 
institution, Russian Ambassador to Ankara Albert Chernyshev 
said: "We do not want a new NATO. If a new security system is 
needed for Europe, then we should do this together." 
  Chernyshev stressed that, in principle, following the 
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, NATO also should have been 
dissolved. 
  In assessing the NATO summit in Brussels, Chernyshev said: 
"If NATO expands, then in principle, the CIS might become 
tougher." 
  In replying to CUMHURIYET's questions on NATO, Chernyshev 
emphasized that the desire of the East European states to enter 
NATO has entered the agenda as a negative attitude toward them 
[Russians]. 
  Chernyshev made the following assessment on NATO 
restructuring: "We do not want a new NATO. In its present form, 
NATO is an antiquated organization. We are saying let us do it 
together. We want to establish a joint security system for 
Europe. NATO could be included, but not the only one. 
Organizations such as CSCE and the United Nations should also 
take part." 
  Stressing that NATO existed for years as a counterbalance to 
the Warsaw Pact, Chernyshev said: "In principle, with the 
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, NATO also should have been 
dissolved, or it should have undergone a serious transformation. 
This is because old scenarios still exist in NATO, and these 
should be abandoned. After all, we have counterscenarios to 
these NATO scenarios. That is why we are calling for the 
creation of a new system." 
  Stressing that a long time is needed to create the new 
institution, Chernyshev said: "We are realists. We must do 
step by step what is required of us for a new organization." 
  Asked "would you consider imparting a new identity to CIS if 
NATO restructures itself by accepting the East European 
countries?" Chernyshev replied: "Of course, in principle that 
is what would happen. That is what would happen in response to 
that. For example, certain countries are now accusing Russia of 
being aggressive. In such a case, it would be natural for us to 
show a counter reaction. It is for this reason that I am 
calling for joint action." 
  Stressing that the European and other countries are 
overreacting in their assessment of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Chernyshev 
said: "Before, we had no nationalism; it was suppressed. Now 
Zhirinovksiy has won 25 percent of the votes in the elections. 
There are politicians in other countries who also think like 
Zhirinovskiy. You, too, have such politicians. One should get 
used to this."

  [Text] Ankara--Turkey has moved to try to establish closer 
relations with Russia in the military field as it has recently 
done in the political domain. A delegation headed by General 
Teoman Erkan, under secretary at the Ministry of National 
Defense, is visiting Russia for that purpose now. Minister of 
National Defense Mehmet Golhan said the delegation will try to 
establish whether or not the two sides can reach a 
reconciliation in the military field. 
  It has been ascertained that Gen. Erkan and his delegation 
have already begun their contacts in Russia. It has also been 
ascertained that Russia will propose to sell MiG-29, MiG-31, and 
SU attack aircraft to Turkey in addition to Kalashnikov 
automatic weapons, various types of helicopters, and BTR-60 and 
BTR-80 armored combat vehicles. Turkey is interested in 
acquiring helicopters, Kalashnikov weapons, and armored combat 
vehicles from that country. However, Ankara prefers that Turkey 
manufacture them under patent. 
  Replying to CUMHURIYET's questions on the visit, Mehmet 
Golhan said: "Attention will be focused more on bilateral 
agreements than on arms purchases. Russia has economic 
problems. Compared with the prices in other countries, several 
items required by the Turkish Armed Forces cost less in Russia. 
Nevertheless, the delegation has not visited that country to 
buy arms. Its objective is to establish whether or not the two 
countries, which were members of two different blocs for many 
years, can cooperate on military issues. We are making an effort 
to establish whether we can reach an agreement for cooperation 
in the military field. That may provide an opportunity to the 
two sides to dispatch observers to follow each other's military 
exercises or exchange students to study in each other's war 
colleges. Meanwhile, the purchase of interesting products or 
the establishment of installations in Turkey to manufacture them 
under patent is also possible." 
  A source in the Russian Embassy in Ankara has assessed the 
delegation's contacts in Moscow as follows: "We attach 
importance to Russia's neighborly relations with Turkey. We 
trust Turkey. In view of that, we can cooperate with Turkey on 
defense in two fields. We can jointly realize several defense 
industry projects. The manufacture of armored vehicles or 
helicopters can be the first step in that direction. We can 
also sell ammunition and firearms to Turkey. In fact, we are 
already selling Kalashnikov automatic weapons. Meanwhile, we 
have proposed to sell MiG-29 and MiG-31 aircraft, which are 
superior to the F-16's, and SU-type planes, which are used in 
air-to-surface operations."

  [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has described 
as a positive development that U.S. President Bill Clinton 
included the activities of the separatist terror organization on 
the agenda of his meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  ANATOLIA Agency reports that Cetin drew attention to the 
fact 
that the U.S. secretary of state, raised PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] terror at a previous meeting he held with his Syrian 
counterpart. 
  Pointing out that it is not sufficient for world countries 
to 
establish ties with Israel in order to bring a lasting peace to 
the Middle East, Cetin noted the importance of the security 
issue in the region. He added that the region has to be purged 
of terror organizations if a lasting peace is to be established. 
Cetin noted that Turkey attaches importance to its ties with 
Syria, but that Syria should put forward its [word indistinct] 
regarding the separatist organization, the PKK.

integrity to be disturbed. 
  In a speech at the Washington ball of the Turkish-American 
Friendship Council, where he was the guest of honor, Karayalcin 
said peoples of many races and ethnic background have been 
living in Anatolia and the Middle East for hundreds of years. 
This created the mosaic we have today, he added. 
  Karayalcin stressed that any border changes that might take 
place in the region from now on will create great problems. 
That is why, he stated, it is of great importance to protect 
Iraq's territorial integrity. 
  Karayalcin pointed out that it will be a grave mistake to 
confuse the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorism with the 
Kurdish problem. Turkey is determined to end PKK terrorism, he 
stressed. 
  Karayalcin will conclude his contacts in the United States 
and leave Washington today.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>
  [Text] The Chief of the General Staff's Office has issued a 
statement saying that a report carried by a private television 
station on 10 January tried to alienate the people from military 
service. The statement added that the nation has reacted to the 
program as it is directed against the Turkish Armed Forces, 
which comes from the heart of the nation. 
  The statement issued by Hursit Tolon, secretary general of 
the chief of staff's office, recalls that various soldiers and 
noncommissioned officers participated in the program in 
question, which carried a report on the government decision to 
defer discharges from the military. Pointing out that the armed 
forces are continuing the necessary administrative and legal 
action against the personnel who participated in the program, 
the statement adds: 
  According to the investigation and information obtained from 
the soldiers and noncommissioned officers who participated in 
the program, some soldiers on furlough were intercepted and 
interviewed so they would express views against the government 
decision, thereby alienating the people against military service 
and creating discontent within the ranks under the guise of 
fulfilling a lofty mission. 
  An atmosphere that will induce the Turkish soldier -- whose 
love of the country, sacrifice and discipline is written down in 
history -- to act in violation of the hierarchic structure and 
tradition of the Turkish Armed Forces has been created under the 
guise of informing the public. 
  The statement notes that the program sends the message that 
a 
group of soldiers and noncommissioned officers are against the 
government decision. What is more grave, it encourages these 
people to disobey the laws, the regulations, and their superior. 
The statement goes on to stress that despite this negative 
propaganda, the Turkish Armed Forces will continue their 
training and their war preparation activities that will enable 
them to succeed their duties in both peace and war, and adds: 
The announcement of this statement was necessary because of the 
reaction of our lofty people, who could not tolerate such a 
program that targeted the Turkish Armed Forces, which emerged 
from its bosom, and the army personnel.

  [Text] Istanbul, Jan. 15 (A.A) -- Government spokesman 
and State Minister Yildirim Aktuna said today that his 
government did not approve of the attitude of security forces 
against the demonstrating public servants two days ago. 
  Many public servants were detained when they attempted to 
protest the government for not recognizing their union rights 
and increasing their salaries very little. The police roughed 
up some of the demonstrators, and the scene was aired by a 
private TV channel the same day. 
  In a press conference, Aktuna said security forces who were 
on duty all over the country had their lives at stake in every 
instance and these were people who were conscious of their job. 
  However, he said, they did not approve of the attitude of 
the 
security forces during the demonstrations. 
  "The importance, seriousness and weight of their duty do not 
justify their sadistic and primitive behavior against our 
people," he said. 
  "The government will make it sure that such behavior will 
not 
be repeated," he said.

  [Text] Greece yesterday accused Turkey of fomenting 
artificial tension in bilateral relations and said its 
ambassador in Ankara had requested a formal explanation of 
remarks made by Turkey's top general about Greece's "hostile" 
behaviour. 
  And European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos sharply 
criticised Ankara for its continued occupation of northern 
Cyprus. "Turkey is the only country in the world which occupies 
militarily the territory of an independent state," he told a 
conference of members of the European Parliament and the U.S. 
Congress. 
  Turkish Military General Staff chief, General Dogan Gures, 
was quoted on Wednesday [12 January] in the press as saying: 
"Greece behaves like an enemy against whom we need to strengthen 
our armed forces." 
  His bellicose statements were made just a day after Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel tried to pour oil on the waters of 
Greek-Turkish relations, stating that drilling on the 
northeastern Aegean seabed was being conducted in Greek waters. 
The statement was interpreted as a tacit gesture of goodwill. 
Turkey has consistently disputed Greek sovereignty of the 
Aegean, refusing to recognise the continental shelf of the 
Aegean islands. 
  Diplomatic sources in Athens described the conflicting tone 
of the statements coming from Ankara as a deliberate attempt to 
project a reasonable and conciliatory image abroad and a tough, 
no-nonsense image at home. But remarks late yesterday by Mr 
Demirel show the "good cop, bad cop" ploy may be part of Turkey 
to depict Greece as the spoiler [sentence as published]. 
  "There is no benefit to Greece to create a crisis under 
present circumstances," he was quoted as saying. 
  Tension between Greece and Turkey rose slightly after the 
former announced it would proceed with oil explorations on the 
seabed off the coast of the island of Thasos. 
  Asked whether the drilling would create problems, Mr Demirel 
said: "If the explorations are confined within the territorial 
waters of Thasos, no problem will be created. If, however, 
action is taken in waters where there are Turkish interests, 
then there will be a problem. The fact that Turkey is trying to 
safeguard its interests through peaceful means should not be 
interpreted as weakness."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said today [words 
indistinct] in light of the Sunday [16 January] visit to Greece 
by international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
Papoulias said he might visit the three sides involved in the 
Yugoslav issue, and then he may convene an extraordinary 
European Union [EU] foreign ministers meeting to promote a 
solution to the Bosnian problem. 
  Replying to a question [words indistinct] that the 
recognition of Skopje by EU member states did not violate 
communal solidarity, the foreign minister said Greece considered 
it a serious violation of communal solidarity and that Skopje's 
intransigence -- especially in light of Greece assuming the 
presidency -- should have restrained the European partners. 
Papoulias reiterated that the Greek side wants Skopje to exist 
as a state, but noted that [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov 
must first take goodwill steps toward Greece.

<F P=106> [Statements by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and </F>
Lord David Owen following talks in the Greek Foreign Ministry in 
Athens -- live] 
  [Text] [Papoulias] First, our talks have not concluded. We 
will continue with a working dinner, and will probably remain in 
contact with you to brief you on what will be discussed over 
dinner. 
  At the invitation of the Greek Presidency of the European 
Union, we welcome Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg to Athens. 
We also welcome Ambassador (Marsais) and Messrs. (Landlow), 
(Ramsarand), (Sabenoir) and (Dan) from the European Commission. 
The subject of our talks is known; it is the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We exchanged views, we briefed each other 
on the latest developments and the ongoing effort by the 
cochairmen [of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia] 
and the Greek Presidency of the European Union. You know things 
are difficult. We are trying to do something better than has 
been done. We always hope. We hope the Geneva talks will be 
positive. The Greek Presidency will make every effort to 
achieve a positive outcome in Geneva, doing as much as it can to 
influence things with the interested parties. You also know 
that today we begin what is the first chapter in the efforts of 
the Greek Presidency toward achieving an immediate cease-fire in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and promoting the Franco-German plan we have 
accepted in the European Union, enforced as I said with the 
thoughts and views of the Greek Presidency, especially as Greece 
is a Balkan country. Thank you very much, now I turn the podium 
over to Lord Owen. 
  [Owen, in English followed by Greek translation at the end 
of 
his remarks] Mr. Foreign Minister, first of all, Mr. Stoltenberg 
and I thank you very much indeed for your hospitality. As you 
say, the meeting will continue but it is very important at this 
early stage in the Greek Presidency that both of us should 
exchange views with you. As you say, as a Balkan state, you 
contribute to the European Union from the depth of knowledge and 
of your proximity to this tragic situation. There is no doubt 
that the neighbors to the former Yugoslavia are paying a very 
heavy price, not just financially but in many other respects for 
the continued fight and the destruction that this is causing in 
the region. Therefore, we must profoundly hope that we can make 
a comprehensive peace settlement and we certainly approach the 
talks in Geneva with that intent, that one has to say that if 
the public statements of the parties are to be believed, then 
the prospects are not very good. But let us hope that those are 
statements for the morale of the fighting forces and that when 
it comes to the actual negotiations, the parties will seek the 
difficult compromises which can alone achieve a peace settlement.

  [Excerpts] The government yesterday dismissed a Skopje plea 
for dialogue, ahead of today's visit to Athens by international 
mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
  "It appears that Skopjean President Gligorov is belatedly 
acknowledging the importance of good relations with Greece for 
the survival of his country," cabinet spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos said yesterday, referring to Mr Gligorov's interview 
with the Italian daily LA REPUBBLICA on Friday [14 January]. 
  "Skopje should therefore finally abandon its intransigence 
and make a gesture of genuine good will towards Greece before we 
could consider opening a dialogue with them," Mr Venizelos added. 
  Worried that his country might be sidelined by the current 
efforts towards a peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav crisis, Mr 
Gligorov said he was prepared to meet the Greek premier, Andreas 
Papandreou, "anytime" to discuss "solutions to all pending 
issues between the two countries." 
  The Greek government spokesman earlier stressed that Athens 
would not link the Skopje issue with the pacification of Bosnia, 
during Owen-Stoltenberg talks. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the delegations of U.S. Congress and European 
Parliament members meeting in Athens yesterday declared 
themselves in favour of a dialogue between Greece and Skopje, 
but also urged the latter to drop the Greek Veryina Sun from its 
national emblem and amend irredentist claims in the Skopje 
constitution. 
  Congressman Tom Landos and Eurodeputy Allan Donnelly told a 
joint news conference at the Athens Zappion Hall: "There is 
great concern in both the U.S. and Europe over the danger of 
hostilities in former Yugoslavia spreading to the former 
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, although we support most of the 
Greek positions on the symbols and constitution of that 
country." The delegates also reserved praises for Greece's 
European orientation and policies, which, Mr Donnelly noted, are 
"more pro-EU than the policies adopted by my own country, 
England." 
  On Monday, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is due to hold 
a 
special meeting with President Konstandinos Karamanlis, to brief 
him on recent developments in the Skopje and Cyprus issues, the 
transatlantic summit in Brussels last Tuesday, as well as on the 
political priorities of the Greek presidency of the European 
Union.

  [Text] Greece is the firm guarantor of peace, security, and 
stability in the Balkans, since it has all the political and 
[word indistinct] advantages. Government spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos made this statement in response to a question on the 
issue of Skopje following the meeting Lord Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg had yesterday with Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias, who is presiding over the European Union. 
  The spokesman stated that there are no secret talks on this 
issue. He reiterated that Greece's positions are well known, 
adding that Foreign Minister Papoulias will go to the United 
States, where he will outline Greek positions to international 
mediator Cyrus Vance, who has already been briefed by Andonios 
Exarkhos, Greece's permanent representative at the United 
Nations. 
  The government spokesman also repeated that any development 
on the Skopje issue depends on practical signs of goodwill by 
Skopje since, as he stressed, [Macedonian President] Kiro 
Gligorov appears to recognize the importance of good relations 
with Greece. These positions, Venizelos added, are not the 
positions of the government, but those of the Greek Republic, 
which Prime Minister Papandreou outlined in Brussels last week 
at the highest and most critical level, the NATO Summit. As is 
known, U.S. President Bill Clinton, European Union Commission 
President Jacques Delors, and the Greek prime minister, who is 
presiding over the European Union, participated in this summit. 
  The government spokesman was also asked to comment on the 
personal statement of Public Order Minister Stilianos 
Papathemelis, who advocated an offensive if Skopje insists on 
the name Macedonia. The spokesman stressed that the government 
positions are only expressed by the prime minister. He said the 
minister has made it clear that his remarks were personal views.

<F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham -- punctuation as published] </F>
  [Excerpt] Following UN envoy Cyrus Vance's meeting with 
Andonios Exarkhos, the Greek permanent UN representative, the 
Athens-Skopje dialogue is being reactivated. Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias confirmed this late last night and mentioned 
that the meeting was held last Friday [14 January], and that the 
Greek ambassador conveyed the Greek positions. 
  AS ELEVTHEROTIPIA reported late last week, Vance asked to 
meet the Greek side for a new discussion on Skopje. Last 
Friday's meeting is the first visible move by the special 
mediator to examine the possibility of resuming the dialogue, 
either directly or through the United Nations. 
<H5>  He Confirmed </H5>
  It is recalled that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
last week expressed both officially and unofficially the UN 
intention to move the issue again (following Papoulias' letter 
postponing the dialogue). So far, Vance has not commented. 
  Lord Owen, the international mediator on the Yugoslav issue, 
arrived in Athens yesterday afternoon and fully confirmed UN 
moves on Skopje. Although Skopje is not among the issues he is 
handling, Owen (who last year was a mediator on Skopje) said: 
"...As you know, the UN secretary general asked Vance to 
facilitate, if he can, any dialogue either through the UN 
process or through direct talks between Athens and Skopje...." 
With this statement, Lord Owen confirmed that "something is 
going on" within the UN to resume the talks but presented two 
alternative solutions: either through the United Nations or 
through direct talks. 
  Some of the media misinterpreted Owen's remarks, initially 
giving the impression that the mediator on the Yugoslav issue 
"was revealing" that a "secret dialogue" or secret diplomacy 
between Athens and Skopje existed. During their joint news 
conference, Owen clarified his remarks, saying: "I do not 
believe there is a secret dialogue.... I mentioned two 
alternative solutions, direct talks or talks through the United 
Nations." He did not hide his preference for direct talks. 
  For his part, Papoulias stressed: "There are no secret or 
behind-the-scenes negotiations." He reiterated the well-known 
Greek position and stressed that Greece is ready to accept a 
move from [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov's side (about the 
flag, symbols, constitution) before the talks can resume.

  [Excerpts] The direction of our national issues and the 
recent NATO summit in Brussels were at the center of the 
75-minute talk President Konstandinos Karamanlis and Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou held today. Upon leaving the 
Presidential Palace, Prime Minister Papandreou stated the 
following: 
  [Begin recording] [Papandreou] I briefed the president on my 
trip to Brussels. We also discussed foreign policy issues and 
domestic policy. It was a good, interesting discussion. It was 
a very interesting dialogue; it wasn't ordinary, but was 
substantive. [passage omitted] I am at your disposal for any 
questions you may have. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Prime Minister, there appears 
to 
be movement around the Skopje issue, and we note pressure on our 
country to participate in a particular form of dialogue. Is our 
country willing to attend a dialogue --either at the United 
Nations or directly -- without the government's conditions first 
being met? 
  [Papandreou] The answer is no. The dialogue will only be 
useful when Skopje abolishes the offensiveness expressed through 
the article in its Constitution that discusses liberating the 
Macedonian people, which actually means liberating a geographic 
area; when they drop the Veryina Sun from their flag; and when 
they stop their continuous offensive propaganda. These are our 
goals. The way policy on the issue is handled depends on the 
moment and the conditions. My answer is clear. We expect 
exactly what you suggested, and what I said. This dialogue will 
deal with various issues, but does not mean recognition of the 
name Macedonia or a name that includes the term Macedonia or its 
derivatives. Of course, the United Nations and the 12 members 
of the European Union have recognized Skopje as FYROM [the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. The Twelve recognized 
Skopje by that name long ago. This dialogue will deal with the 
name as well, not on the understanding that we are ready to 
change our basic and firm position, but based on our hope that 
we can convince Skopje that they will benefit in many ways by 
choosing another name and thus end the issue of recognition by 
Greece. Greece cannot recognize a state with the name 
Macedonia. The irony is that while Greece is a country with no 
territorial claim against this statelet [Skopje], the economic 
viability of which depends on Greece, the Greek economy, the 
Greek geography... [Papandreou pauses] these are our thoughts. 
They will probably be detailed at the Chamber of Deputies, and 
answers will be given. I want to stress that foreign policy, 
especially on Skopje, is handled by me personally and by Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias. No one else handles policy on 
Skopje, either directly or indirectly. We should be very clear 
on this. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister, did you discuss the drilling 
for oil on Thasos Island, and whether Greece maintains its right 
to drill beyond the six miles [of territorial water] or within 
the Greek continental shelf? 
  [Papandreou] You said a lot in one question. We did not 
discuss this issue, but you know the Greek position. The 
continental shelf's boundaries have not been drawn up. We know 
that. We ask Turkey to come with us to the Hague to agree on 
the boundaries of the continental shelf. The Geneva 
Convention's primary article regarding the issue is that the 
islands have a continental shelf. Based on the premise that 
international law clearly states that the islands have a 
continental shelf, Greece can proceed to drill in the Aegean, 
where... [Papandreou pauses] and not only in its territorial 
water, because the islands have a continental shelf. This is a 
fact. What Greece will do and how it will handle the whole 
affair is another issue. Our policy on the affair is another 
issue. We have no reason to aggravate our relations with 
Turkey. Turkey is offensive, but I think its deceipt is mainly 
for domestic consumption. They have a need, I think, to speak 
of such things to cover other weaknesses, their economy, and 
domestic developments. [end recording]

txt}[Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said 
that the Greek foreign policy positions are known, oft repeated, 
and clear in every direction. Venizelos was referring to press 
reports which, he said, imply that Greek policy on Skopje and 
the dialogue is changing. The name is not up for negotiation, 
the government spokesman said. He noted that Skopje must 
believe that it is to its benefit to change the name. The name 
is not subject to negotiation, but becomes an issue of dialogue 
so that the Greek side can expand on its position.

  Answering questions, Venizelos said the government considers 
acceptance of such a proposal possible and noted that he is 
under the impression that the Greek side's statements are not 
falling on deaf ears. The government spokesman pointed out that 
there has been no move from the government's positions and 
repeated that no country will be recognized with the name 
Macedonia or its derivatives. He added that the government 
expects tangible and practical signs from Skopje that would 
diminish its intransigence and provocation. 
  Replying to other questions, he said Greece agreed to 
Skopje's application to join the United Nations as the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which came up during the New 
Democracy's term in power. Asked about the level of dialogue 
with Skopje, Venizelos said it is too early to say anything and 
added that the process is still pending at the United Nations. 
It is within that framework that Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias sent a letter. The government spokesman noted that 
the previous government was characterized by double talk, while 
this government tells everyone the same things.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis </F>
by correspondent Anna Panayiotarea; place, date not 
given--punctuation as published] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Panayiotarea] Reliable 
sources tell me that along with reforms in the Armed Forces 
leadership, you are planning for full-time units of specialized 
soldiers to handle new weapons. 
  [Arsenis] Indeed. New technology demands that some soldiers 
serve more than the average term. We have the voluntary 
five-year service term, but its purpose is limited. The main 
body of the Armed Forces includes the regular recruits. We 
should have some specialized soldiers. 
  [Panayiotarea] Will there be reform in the composition of 
units? For example, will a regiment, as we know it now... 
  [Arsenis] Yes. The basic defense doctrine we have dates back 
to 1985. Today, we face a new situation. The meaning of danger 
and stability have changed. We should also deal with our 
defense budget perhaps with fewer numbers in the military. If 
possible, with a smaller defense budget. To do all this, we 
need mobile, more effective, and modern forces. 
  [Panayiotarea] Is NATO forcing this reform or is it your 
initiative? 
  [Arsenis] It is our initiative, but there is also a parallel 
move by NATO. Previously, NATO gathered its forces on borders 
to face the danger from the East, the Soviet bloc. This threat 
no longer exists. The meaning of common security has changed, 
hence NATO's structure is changing. They go together. 
  [Panayiotarea] But our defense against Turkey does not run 
parallel with NATO... 
  [Arsenis] Unfortunately, this threat exists. It is the 
primary threat facing Greece. Lately, there has been an effort, 
an unsuccessful one in my opinion, by the Turkish side to 
artificially revive the crisis between Greece and Turkey, aiming 
to create problems for Greece during its Presidency of the 
European Union. 
  [Panayiotarea] So, our defense policy toward Turkey remains 
firm? 
  [Arsenis] Of course. The reform of the Armed Forces we 
discussed is designed primarily to deal with this basic threat. 
  [Panayiotarea] Well, what is NATO's role now that the former 
Warsaw Pact is close to becoming part of NATO and there is no 
longer a threat? 
  [Arsenis] Brussels found the ideal solution. The 16 NATO 
members will remain members, but NATO will be open to ad hoc 
cooperation with other countries, mainly European, and of course 
with Cyprus. In that way, we will have greater, flexible 
cooperation with the 16 NATO members as the main body. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Panayiotarea] Before the election, you discussed a popular 
defense. What did you mean? Did you mean the TEA [National 
Defense Battalions]? 
  [Arsenis] There is a need to implement it soon. It is not 
the TEA. We have many kilometers of border without defense 
depth. We have a demographic problem; we have few young people 
to enlist in the Armed Forces. So, the people who do not 
participate in the Armed Forces must be used as support in time 
of need. 
  [Panayiotarea] To take up arms? 
  [Arsenis] Not necessarily. Let us take an island for 
example. Beyond its tactical army, the population is there to 
help in a defense plan in case of emergency. If, for example, 
the water reservoir is bombarded, the well- organized locals can 
take care of it so there will be no need to send the army to 
repair the system. In February, I hope we will circulate the 
relevant draft bill to the involved ministries and discuss it 
with the political parties. I hope to secure the support of all 
the parties in the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Panayiotarea] What about the defense of Cyprus? 
  [Arsenis] It is a high national priority. We are two 
independent states of Hellenism facing a threat from the same 
source -- Turkey. We can and should coordinate our defense 
plans. When we discuss a unified defense space, we are actually 
discussing coordinating our defense plans so that together we 
can be more effective than we are alone. 
  [Panayiotarea] But don't some say that you alone decided who 
will be the new National Guard commander? 
  [Arsenis] We will abide strictly by the procedure prescribed 
by the form of bilateral cooperation. The commander of the 
Cypriot National Guard will be appointed by a joint decision.

Thrace. Speaking during his visit to Kipoi border checkpoint 
this morning, Evert referred to Greek-Turkish relations and 
stressed: 
  [Begin Evert recording] This is the guardpost of Greek and 
European interests. This should be understood by the Europeans 
as well as the Turks. They should realize that for the good of 
the Greek and Turkish people, this border and this bridge should 
be one of cooperation between the peoples, because diplomatic 
and political impasses benefit no one. We are going through a 
period in which all people and all governments should do 
everything possible for peace. It will be useful if Turkey 
understands this. [end recording] 
  Evert also stressed that when the Greek people are united, 
they do not lose national battles. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Republican Assembly Speaker Ayhan Halit Acarkan has 
stressed that the transfer of Greek commandos to south Cyprus is 
an obstruction of the peaceful initiatives with regard to the 
Cyprus problem. This attitude, Acarkan noted, gives a clear 
indication of the desire to obtain results in Cyprus through the 
use of force rather than through negotiations. 
  In a written statement issued today, Acarkan said that when 
confidence-building measures are on the agenda and when the 
world's attention is turning toward Cyprus, we are witnessing a 
new example of the extent to which the Greek Cypriots differ 
from the confidence-building concept. He pointed out that it 
has again become evident that the Greek Cypriot-Greek side 
encourages and aggravates nonconfidence, rather than creates 
trust. 
  The contradictions contained in the statements issued on 
this 
subject are tantamount to poking fun at the world, unless they 
are a manifestation of guilty feelings, Acarkan remarked. 
Recalling that the Greek Cypriots first stated that joint Greek 
Cypriot-Greek military exercises will be conducted within the 
framework of the joint defense doctrine, and then they denied 
this and claimed that the Greek commandos came to vacation in 
Cyprus, Acarkan said this is the first time in history that 
fully armed military units have been taken on vacation. 
  The Assembly speaker advised the Greek Cypriot-Greek side to 
contribute sincerely contribute to the quest for peace and to 
refrain from actions that may aggravate the lack of confidence.

  [Text] Lefkosa [Nicosia], Jan 14 (AA) -- Prime Minister 
Hakki Atun of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) 
said on Friday [14 January] that his country will announce its 
views on confidence building measures after discussing the issue 
together with Turkish officials. 
  Prime minister of the coalition government and Democratic 
Party leader Atun, speaking after a meeting with Gustave 
Feissel, the United Nations deputy special envoy to Cyprus, said 
Feissel conveyed the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
recent offers on the issue. 
  Atun said Greek Cypriots had a negative approach to the 
confidence building measures, adding that their negative 
approach affected the process of talks. 
  Feissel said their aim was to provide a peaceful and lasting 
solution to the Cyprus problem. 
  Meanwhile TRNC foreign minister who is also acting as 
defense 
minister Atay Ahmet Rasit criticized the coming of Greek 
commandos to the island saying Greek Cypriots' military 
initiations hampered confidence measures.

  [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis has said that our 
side will continue to show goodwill in negotiations for a just, 
viable, and functional Cyprus solution. He warned, however, 
that it would be wrong to misinterpret the goodwill as a 
willingness to accept a solution that will not secure the 
withdrawal of the occupation troops and the implementation of 
human rights and basic freedoms. Kliridhis was speaking at 
ceremony to unveil a statue of Griyorios Avxendiou dedicated by 
Lisi Municipality in Kalo Khorion, Larnaca. 
  Kliridhis reiterated that the struggle continues to free 
Cyprus from the occupation troops and settlers, to secure the 
right to return of the refugees, to safeguard human rights for 
all citizens, and to determine the fate of the missing persons. 
He added that we are also striving for Cyprus to join the 
European Union and to achieve progress in conditions of 
permanent peace and security. He stressed: We will accept 
nothing less than this. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has privately expressed 
his strong discontent with the absoluteness that characterizes 
the stance of certain political parties on the issue of 
confidence-building measures. Specifically, President Kliridhis 
stresses: The stance of these political parties makes his 
handling of policy more difficult and does not allow him to 
develop easily the policy he has in mind, especially in view of 
the expected acceptance of the confidence-building measures by 
the Turkish side and the beginning of talks. 
  Political circles have characteristically said the message 
these parties have sent to the world creates a negative 
impression of the Greek Cypriot side's sincerity about the 
negotiations; and on the other hand, it gives the Turkish side 
material for propaganda. 
  In light of the above, and despite the fact that he accepts 
the right of these parties to express their positions as they 
believe appropriate, President Kliridhis feels that their 
behavior makes it difficult for him to develop his policy on the 
issue of the confidence-building measures.

  [Text] In case of an impasse on the Cyprus issue, the UN 
Security Council is committed to study suggestions by the UN 
secretary general for alternative ways to implement the many UN 
resolutions on Cyprus. Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis 
made the above statement today in response to suggestions from 
correspondents that the Cyprus case will be put aside if there 
is another impasse. The Government spokesman said this 
evaluation is incorrect, because if the impasse continues due to 
the Turkish side, the Security Council has assumed a specific 
commitment to study suggestions by the secretary general for 
alternative ways to implement the many UN resolutions on Cyprus. 
  In the meantime, diplomatic activity regarding the Cyprus 
issue is intensifying, especially in view of the trip by Joe 
Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative, 
scheduled for the end of this week. Foreign diplomats in 
Nicosia expect the Turkish side to respond to the 
confidence-building measures in the next few days. A government 
source told the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation that the Greek 
Cypriot side insists on a positive and unconditional response 
without new demands, and will not move from this position. 
  The Cyprus Government has sent a message to the Turkish side 
and every other interested party stressing that it has accepted 
the confidence-building measures in principle. The government 
spokesman also said the government accepts the philosophy behind 
the confidence-building measures -- opening the entire fenced 
area of Famagusta and operating Nicosia International Airport -- 
and called on the Turkish side to do the same. If the Turkish 
side does something like this, the spokesman said, we are ready 
to discuss ways of implementing the confidence-building measures.

  [Excerpt] House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos 
strongly attacked Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's 
government from the parliament's official podium. Galanos 
accused the Papandreou government of impolitic actions and lack 
of sensitivity toward the government and people of Cyprus. 
  Despite his efforts to maintain diplomatic protocol, Galanos 
did not refrain from using very strong language to describe the 
way the Greek government action in canceling the Cypriot 
National Council meeting with the prime minister in Athens and 
for recalling National Guard Commander Lieutenant General 
Yeoryios Siradhakis. 
  "I would like to express my personal discontent with the 
fact 
that the Papandreou government, which raised the morale of our 
people by elevating the Cyprus issue as a national priority, did 
not show the necessary sensitivity toward our government and 
people in these two cases, which were, at the least, 
unfortunate," said Galanos in his address during the debate on 
the 1994 state budgets. Galanos explained that the two 
incidents to which he referred include the last minute 
cancellation of the National Council's visit to Greece and the 
impolitic firing of Lt. Gen. Siradhakis, especially considering 
the way it was done, despite the Greek prime minister's 
assurances and commitment to President Glavkos Kliridhis.

  [Excerpts] Russia has asked Finland for information on the 
activities of two Finnish organizations. HELSINGEN SANOMAT 
newspaper reported on Saturday [15 January] that the Russian 
Embassy in Helsinki had submitted a written note to the Finnish 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, asking if the Patriotic 
National League, the IKL, and the Greater Finland Association 
were compatible with the stipulations of the Paris peace treaty. 
Under the terms of that agreement, Finland disbanded a number 
of nationalist and right-wing organizations which the Soviet 
Union considered to be fascist. The IKL is modeled after a 
political party that was banned after the last war. The 
initials of the organization are the same, however the name is 
slightly different. The Greater Finland organization has been 
collecting signatures on a petition calling for the return of 
territories ceded to the Soviet Union at the end of the war. 
  Finland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Heikki Haavisto said 
the Russian note did not come as a surprise. Top Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs officials say the Russian note cannot be 
considered a serious issue. They say that when they answer the 
note, the Finns will say that the two organizations in question 
will be dealt with according to Finnish law alone and that the 
organizations do not violate the Paris peace treaty. 
  Raimo Ilaskivo, the Conservative candidate in Finland's 
presidential election, expressed surprise about the Russian 
note, particularly concerning its timing, the day before the 
first round in the voting of the presidential election. He said 
one cannot avoid the question of whether or not the note is an 
attempt to influence the outcome of the voting. Prime Minister 
Esko Aho said he did not feel the note would have any impact on 
Finland's presidential election. Center Party presidential 
candidate Vayrynen, meanwhile, said he was surprised by the 
note, and did not feel the two organizations in question were in 
violation of the Paris peace treaty. Defense Minister Elisabeth 
Rehn, the Swedish People's Party candidate, does not consider 
the note any interference in Finland's internal affairs. 
[passage omitted] 
  Yuriy Deryabin, the Russian ambassador in Finland, insists 
that the note is not linked in any way to Sunday's presidential 
election or to the electoral success of Russian ultranationalist 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. In an interview with YLE television 
news, Mr. Deryabin says that the first inquiry concerning the 
two organizations was made in May, and was repeated after no 
reply came to the first one. He also said the note does not 
call for disbanding the organizations and, contrary to the days 
of Soviet power, Russia does not interfere in Finland's internal 
affairs. 
  On Friday, meanwhile, Andrey Nikolayev, the commander of 
Russia's border guard, denounced what he sees as nationalist 
forces in neighboring countries inciting anti-Russian sentiment. 
He said ultranationalist groups in Finland, the Baltic 
republics, and elsewhere are working to change the present 
borders. YLE political correspondent Pentti Lumme says the note 
is a reminder by Russia that the Paris peace treaty is still in 
force. Finland unilaterally canceled sections of the treaty, 
placing limits on its military, but other sections remain in 
force, including those banning fascist organizations.

  [Text] Martti Ahtisaari and Elisabeth Rehn are going 
forward to the second round of the elections. Martti Ahtisaari 
has 25.9 percent of the votes, Elisabeth Rehn 22 percent, Paavo 
Vaeyrynen 19.5 percent, and Raimo Ilaskivi 15.5 percent. Then 
there are the other candidates. There is quite a big gap to the 
next one, Keijo Korhonen, with 5.8 percent; Claes Andersson with 
3.8 percent; Pertti Virtanen 3 percent; Eeva Kuuskoski 2.6 
percent; Toimi Kankaanniemi and Sulo Aittoniemi, both with 1 
percent; and Pekka Tiainen with 0.2 percent. 
  Looking at the absolute number of votes, perhaps they will 
stay in some people's minds. Martti Ahtisaari received just 
over 800,000 votes in these elections, Elisabeth Rehn 700,000 
votes, Paavo Vaeyrynen just over 600,000, and Raimo Ilaskivi 
nearly 500,000. At a rough glance, there are just over 1 
million votes to be distributed in the second round of the 
elections, if we assume that everybody sticks to their 
candidates in the first round, that is Ahtisaari and Rehn.

  [Excerpt] Elisabeth Rehn of the Swedish People's Party 
turned the first round of the presidential elections into 
something of a thriller. In the vote count, she climbed to 
second place after the Social Democrats' Martti Ahtisaari, which 
means that Ahtisaari and Rehn will meet in the second round of 
elections in three weeks. According to the latest opinion polls, 
Rehn will defeat Ahtisaari and be elected president. 
  Ahtisaari polled 25.9 percent of the votes in the first 
round 
of the elections, and Rehn polled 22 percent. Paavo Vaeyrynen 
of the Center was third with 19.5 percent of the votes and Raimo 
Ilaskivi of the Coalition was fourth with 15.2 percent. The 
election turnout was 78.4 percent. 
  Elisabeth Rehn secured nearly four times more votes than the 
Swedish People's Party normally polls in a Diet election. She 
polled about 700,000 votes, while Ahtisaari polled about 
826,000. Rehn outdistanced Vaeyrynen by over 78,000 votes. 
  Elisabeth Rehn secured the majority of today's votes, 26.7 
percent, and 15.5 percent of the postal votes. Ahtisaari polled 
24.9 percent of today's votes, and 27.2 percent of the postal 
votes. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Major Esko Tavia, detachment field officer, </F>
General Staff technical development unit: "Security Policy 
Debate Now in Progress Is Getting Nowhere Fast; Basis for 
Credible Defense Capability May Crumble"] 
  [Text] According to the government, Finland intends to 
maintain a credible national defense capability. Esko Tavia asks 
whether this goal is in keeping with the existing reality and 
our prospects for the future. 
  All of a sudden we get the impression from the discussions 
of 
the past few days that the country's economy will get back into 
shape all at once by giving up the new F-18 Hornet interceptors 
that have been ordered for the Armed Forces. 
  Television current affairs programs, the equipment displayed 
in parades, the lines of generals at Independence Day [6 
December] celebrations, and the presidential election panels 
have probably misled people into thinking that the country, 
which is struggling with its economic difficulties, has totally 
exaggerated its defense needs. 
  In trying to cope with the nation's economic difficulties, 
there is talk of budget limits and cutting expenditures. Each 
of the various business sectors has received a given share of 
future budgets on which to base their plans. 
  The expenditures for the major chief categories of the 
national budget are in large part prescribed by law. The 
Eduskunta has passed laws in keeping with our world of values. 
Our society has evolved through the joint decisions of those who 
look after the interests of its different groups. 
  Our national defense was not separately developed by 
promoting some private sphere of interest. Defense policy has 
been part of our foreign policy. 
<H5>  Defense Committees Have Come Up With Common Approach </H5>
  The Armed Forces' mission has been determined by law and the 
parliamentary defense committees have provided the directions 
and goals for their development. In retrospect, however, we have 
to assert that the objectives determined by them have never been 
achieved. 
  The development of Finland's national defense has long been 
guided by the tradition that expenditures for defense must 
amount to about 1.5 percent of the gross national product. The 
only reason for continuing the tradition appears to be the 
realization that we cannot afford any more than that. 
  The reason for the niggardliness cannot be a lack either or 
will or of appreciation of the situation. Parliamentary defense 
policy debates conducted over the decades demonstrate this. 
  The defense committees have always come up and agreed on a 
common approach. Nevertheless, there has never been an open, 
polished analysis in terms of military technology and military 
policy like those made in the West, based on their reports. 
Recollections of military experiences, the tradition of the 
proletariat army, and an active, peace-seeking neutrality policy 
currently constitute the basis for our defense decisions. 
  The security policy debate now in progress is getting 
nowhere 
fast. Nonalignment and an independent defense sound like mere 
empty rhetoric if we adhere closely to the defense expenditure 
level of 1.5 percent while the national economy is being 
strangled. 
  Defense policy studies conducted in areas close to our 
borders and in West Europe have raised the level of 
appropriations for defense in those countries to over 2 percent 
of the gross national product. 
  A rigorous discussion of values is needed now so that we do 
not do irreparable damage with shortsighted decisions to cut 
expenditures. The present defense policy solution cannot be 
changed in the foreseeable future, nor is there any need to 
either. The danger lies in the fact that the defense capability 
it is based on may crumble very quickly. A parliamentary 
committee does not have to be appointed at this point, but it is 
urgent that we set in motion a major study to determine our 
defense capability. 
  When considering the order of importance of things, the 
foundation pillars of an independent nation's existence, the 
provision of external and internal security, should be raised to 
their own position. If they totter, it will be hard to imagine 
what can be achieved for the rest of the development of the 
society with long-range investment. In principle, we can only 
see what else we can afford after matters involving our security 
are at an at least satisfactory level. 
  Appropriations for defense accounted for only 5 percent of 
this year's budget. This was a drop of about 8 percent from the 
funds allocated last year. 
  Of this 8.7-billion-markka appropriation, 2.7 billion were 
used for expenditures for defense equipment. Appropriations will 
decrease over the next few years to a point at which we will 
only be able to spend about a billion markkas a year on new 
fighter aircraft after the mid-1990's. This approaching sharp 
drop is not based on need, but on tradition. 
  It is perfectly clear that all of the Hornets that were 
ordered will have to be purchased. Speculations on a reduction 
in the number of fighters that have appeared in the press are 
irresponsible populism. Our air defense is built on 60 
interceptors, or three squadrons. No one can show that a single 
one of these is unnecessary given our security environment. 
<H5>  Military Technology May Become Unattainable </H5>
  Reports on the development of military technology that are 
to 
be prepared in the not too distant future will show that 
appropriations cannot be reduced because of military technology, 
but that their present level must be raised to the average 
European level. 
  Suspending development of our ground forces for decades will 
give our immediate neighbors an unattainable lead over us. A 
decision to increase appropriations for defense to a level 
compatible with an independent and credible defense is certainly 
a politically difficult one. We must nevertheless now have the 
courage to act and bear the responsibility for such a decision. 
  The technological level and real performance capability of 
our immediate neighbors' armed forces is growing so fast that 
our present funding level will under no circumstances be high 
enough to provide a credible defense by the turn of the century. 
  The basic question is: Will we defend this country in the 
future or not?

<F P=106> [Inger Viklund-Persson report: "Agreement on NATO </F>
Invitation"] 
  [Text] At yesterday's meeting of the Foreign Affairs 
Council, Prime Minister Carl Bildt reiterated Sweden's positive 
attitude toward participation in the NATO cooperation program, 
Partnership for Peace. 
  "The Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry will now look 
at the details of the NATO initiative and see how we should 
proceed. We will also discuss this with other countries, chiefly 
with Finland, which has more or less the same attitude as we 
do," the prime minister said after the meeting. 
  Prime Minister Bildt also stressed that Sweden is almost 
best 
in the world at peacekeeping operations and could contribute its 
special competence. 
  "We can offer other countries training at the UN school at 
Almnas outside Sodertalje." 
  Social Democratic leader Ingvar Carlsson was generally 
positive. He said that the meeting had chiefly had the 
character of a briefing. 
  In the past, the Social Democratic leader has called for 
consultations among party leaders on Swedish security policy. 
The prime minister's response has been that the question would 
be discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council after 
the Christmas and New Year holidays. The meeting yesterday did 
not touch on the question at all, however.

  [Text] The Swiss Government has threatened sanctions 
against Libya in line with the United Nations sanctions imposed 
in connection with the Lockerbie airliner bombing. The Swiss 
Foreign Ministry said Libyan state assets in Swiss banks would 
be frozen, all air traffic connections with Libya would be 
banned, and oil industry supplies would be stopped. A ban on 
weapons exports is already in force. The Swiss Government said 
the measures, taking effect on Thursday [13 January] were taken 
in solidarity with international efforts against terrorism.

  [Text] The Swiss Government says it is considering further 
steps in connection with France's refusal to extradite two 
Iranians wanted in Switzerland. The Swiss Foreign Ministry made 
the announcement without providing details, but an investigating 
judge says he is continuing enquiries, hoping for new 
developments in the affair. 
  France reneged on previous extradition pledges and expelled 
the two wanted men last year. The expulsion caused a diplomatic 
row between France and Switzerland and the Swiss justice 
minister, Arnold Koller, said on Wednesday that Switzerland 
would raise the subject with the Council of Europe, if 
necessary. He said France should explain why the Iranians were 
not extradited as originally agreed. The two Iranians are 
wanted in connection with the killing of an Iranian opposition 
leader, Kazem Rajavi, in Geneva nearly three years [as heard] 
ago.

  [Text] "And now it is up to voters, because the future of 
democracy depends on the intelligence, will, participation, and 
sense of duty of all citizens." 
  This is the end of the message sent by the head of state to 
Giovanni Spadolini [speaker of the Senate], and to Giorgio 
Napolitano [speaker of the Chamber of Deputies], along with the 
decree dissolving the Chambers. "Unmistakable facts made it 
necessary to dissolve the Chambers," the president wrote. 
Scalfaro mentioned in particular the referendum of 18 April 
1993, when an overwhelming majority of voters demanded new 
[electoral] rules, and the 1993 administrative elections, which 
showed there had been deep changes in relations among parties.

  [Text] Now we hear from Deputy Prime Minister Antonio 
Maccanico, on why the elections were fixed for 27 March. He is 
speaking to Sergio De Luca. 
  [Begin recording] [De Luca] March 27 -- a small concession 
to 
the Christian Democrat Party which wanted a little more time? 
  [Maccanico] Setting 27 March as the date of the election was 
necessary. We could not go beyond that date because we would 
have gone beyond the 70 days laid down by the constitution. We 
could not bring the elections forward to the preceding Sunday, 
20 March, because if we had we would not have had enough time to 
fulfill our obligations before polling. I would like to remind 
people that among these obligations is the one, for example, of 
having to communicate to each and every Italian citizen the name 
of their constituency. 
  [De Luca] Practicing Jews will not be able to vote [due to 
Passover]. Could they take the matter to the Constitutional 
Court or to the Regional Administrative Tribunal? 
  [Maccanico] I do not think that this will be possible. There 
has been no violation of the law which enshrines the agreement 
with Italy's Jewish community. There is no regulation within 
that law which envisages a particular set of rules for general 
elections. There is protection for the Sabbath, and there are 
exceptions for safeguarding special services, but there are no 
special rules regarding the constitutional life of the country.

  [Text] By rejecting Ciampi's resignation, President 
Scalfaro has allowed the government to retain all of its powers 
until the elections. Let's see what these powers are and what 
political limits they have. 
  [Correspondent Cesare Pucci] The Ciampi government following 
the dissolution of the chambers: Scalfaro rejected Ciampi's 
resignation. Therefore, we have a government which juridically 
retains all of its powers. Juridically means the government has 
no constitutional limitations, only political ones. In other 
words, Ciampi cannot make decisions behind closed doors that may 
require a major discussion in parliament; and by the same 
measure, he cannot make decisions that could interfere with the 
electoral campaign. He can, on the other hand, draw up bills. 
In this case, he is obliged to present them to parliament, which 
in this case will remain in charge until a new one is sworn in, 
within 10 days. 
  Therefore, we have a government which retains its full 
powers, but which cannot influence the field of play when the 
deciding match for the championship is being fought. It is in 
fact this electoral match -- the first to be played under new 
rules -- which the Italian people want to see played as quickly 
as possible. They did this by approving the referendum issues 
of 18 April [1993]. 
  As Scalfaro wrote to the speakers of the chambers, this was 
the main reason for the early dissolution of the parliament, 
even if there was no government crisis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mino Martinazzoli, secretary of the Italian </F>
Christian Democratic Party, by Gianluca Luzi in Rome; date not 
given: "`I Am Right; Victory in the Center' -- Martinazzoli 
Drops Mediating Role"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Luzi] Senator Martinazzoli, 
you said, speaking off the cuff, that "the message must not be 
reduced to partisanship in politics," but I assume that you are 
pleased about the pope's intervention at such a crucial moment? 
  [Martinazzoli] I have tried to keep my reading of this 
message free from considerations of short-term interest or even 
partisan interpretations. I am sure that the most accurate 
interpretations are those that underline the European dimension, 
which I think was the connecting thread and at the same time the 
key to understanding the orientation of the message. Be that as 
it may, taking proper account of the differences, this was the 
approach of my own report to the assembly in July. I added in 
that report that the corollary of all this was the 
reconstruction of the national sense of community. 
  [Luzi] But in his letter to the bishops the pope also 
addressed the Italian voters; that is, he intervened directly in 
politics. 
  [Martinazzoli] The pope's viewpoint, which I obviously 
share, 
is, more or less, that this European building must not be 
impoverished by the absence of a Christian mark of identity. In 
my reading, precisely in order to remain faithful to this 
exhortation, I reject any petty interpretation -- that is, the 
idea of somebody else resolving for us the problems that we face 
as a political force. 
  [Luzi] But almost everyone has interpreted the pope's 
remarks 
as an outright appeal for people to vote for the Catholic party. 
  [Martinazzoli] That does not mean that their interpretation 
is correct. The appeal for people to believe that enhanced 
unity -- not passive or forcible, but active and convinced -- 
bears witness to these duties is one thing; and to interpret the 
remarks as saying that it is necessary to support one hypothesis 
rather than another, is a different matter. Of course, the 
challenge that I have set myself is to gather as much support as 
possible, but I do not attack this claim to that message. I 
would add that our endeavor -- which, through no coincidence, is 
inspired by Sturzo -- must of course take account of the 
contributions of the Catholic world, but it also aspires to 
build a nonconfessional home inhabited by Catholics, but by 
nonconfessionals too, who share the principles and the policies 
that we are putting forward. 
  [Luzi] At the moment, however, the Catholic inhabitants of 
this home, still under construction, seem very quarrelsome. 
Bindi, Casini.... How will you make them get along? 
  [Martinazzoli] I am not only unenthusiastic about, but now 
totally opposed to, the idea that the issues facing us entail 
daily mediation between the assertions of the various sides. 
  [Luzi] Yes, but behind the verbal disputes there lies the 
problem of alliances, of the choice of camp. 
  [Martinazzoli] I think that it is wrong to believe that in 
Italy there is a clear and sharply defined polarity between left 
and right, conservatives and progressives. For instance, the 
scenario presented by "Milano Italia" with reference to a 
certain opinion poll is of considerable interest. It shows that 
our idea of a rotation not confined to the two most extreme 
poles is correct. This, because it is emerging that a force 
representing a program and a government leadership proposal 
involving us and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni will win most of 
the votes that do not go to the left-wing alliance. 
  [Luzi] But it will not be enough to govern with. 
  [Martinazzoli] But it will be enough to be able to draw on, 
and not to betray, a whole political heritage. 
  [Luzi] Be that as it may, then the problem of government 
alliances will begin. 
  [Martinazzoli] Of course. Not only after the elections, but 
even now, during the pre-election stage. 
  [Luzi] So let us talk about alliances. You described Bossi's 
latest turnabout as "interesting" and said that Berlusconi is 
right when he says that the Left is competing with no rivals. 
Will they be your allies, together with Segni? 
  [Martinazzoli] I was asked whether there was a danger of a 
victory by a left-wing alliance, and I do not think that that is 
a discovery of Berlusconi's. It is what many people hope for, 
an obvious fact. But it raises certain questions. This, 
because -- apart from the arrogance of Mr. D'Alema [Democratic 
Party of the Left (PDS) Deputy Secretary], who tries to pretend 
many things -- I think I perceive certain difficulties in 
building this alliance. The PDS' separation from its history is 
gainsaid by the encumbrance of Communist Renaissance. Then 
there is Orlando's Rete movement, of which all you can perceive 
is its extreme language. Are these insignificant problems? 
Will they pass unobserved by the voters, who will have to 
choose? I think not. 
  [Luzi] But that applies to your political adversaries. What 
about your allies? 
  [Martinazzoli] It is necessary to have pride in your 
proposal, and the conviction that it is an apposite one; the 
rest is a matter for political calculations and maneuvering. 
Let me give you an example: After the elections -- however 
they may go, and whatever positions the political forces may 
assume -- what could the League do in Parliament if it remains 
on its own? I will not use the word "hegemony," which I do not 
like, but I do say that a proposal that is made visible and 
authoritative and that wins support, such as ours, is a force 
with a great power of attraction. This is a political fact. 
The aspect of how it is experienced, interpreted, and managed 
belongs to the sphere of the dynamism of politics, to our 
actions, to those of others, to everything happening around us.

<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Two Socialist Party Floor </F>
Leaders at the Chamber of Deputies -- The Split Begins"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The end of the present legislature may only 
be three days away. However, since yesterday, the PSI [Italian 
Socialist Party] has two floor leaders in the persons of Franco 
Piro and Nicola Capria, and -- mustered around them -- two 
parliamentary groups. One of them, the largest, originates from 
the old guard, whereas the smaller one is loyal to [PSI 
Secretary] Del Turco. This is a sort of inverted preview of the 
split proper, which will take place at the end of the month, 
when the majority will follow the party's secretary to form a 
new Socialist force on the left, while the Craxian minority will 
move, with all their belongings, into the moderate camp: 
perhaps to join forces with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, most 
certainly -- as has already been announced by Treasury Deputy 
Secretary Maurizio Sacconi -- to join forces with the Northern 
League and Silvio Berlusconi. 
  Following weeks of expectation, the split among the 
Socialist 
deputies is thus suddenly becoming a fact, and will in all 
probability lead to the "rebels" being suspended from the PSI. 
Moreover, it is becoming a fact in the presence of the entire 
old general staff, who all hurried to vote for Piro and to pose 
for a group photograph featuring Craxi, De Michelis, Di Donato, 
Signorile, and all their unconditional followers, in addition to 
a small group of supporters of former Finance Minister Formica 
-- ranging from Sollazzo to Dell'Unto -- who voted for Dell'Unto 
at the national assembly. Overall, 51 deputies out of 91, 
practically all those present once the minority had left the 
room in order not to take part in the vote following the 
announcement by Capria -- who is supposed to have resigned 
months ago, but was never replaced -- that the meeting was 
closed. 
  Led by Ugo Intini and Maurizio Sacconi, the "rebels" decided 
to go their own way, declaring that they could not address the 
issue of confidence from a position with which they could not 
identify. When Capria and his followers left, those who stayed 
replaced him with the deputy floor leaders, first electing Piro 
and then adopting a document which voiced their "indignation at 
the humiliations that the PSI has suffered at the hands of the 
so-called progressive table," and warned the secretary "not to 
make political choices outside the statutory regulations." 
  A polemic concerning the two floor leaders' legitimacy 
flared 
up immediately. Del Turco spoke of a "very serious action" and 
of a "split within the parliamentary group," confirming his 
confidence in Capria, who, in the meantime, claimed before 
[Lower House speaker] Napolitano that the procedure followed by 
Craxi's followers for the election was illegal, while Labriola 
stated categorically that such an election "does not exist." 
  For their part -- while they wait for Napolitano to 
pronounce 
-- Piro and the others claim that the election was carried out 
according to the rules: "Nothing tragic happened," said Intini. 
"Quite simply, the group elected a new floor leader who does not 
share the secretariat's line." While "rebel" deputy floor 
leaders Sollazzo and Poti denied having carried out a split and 
shouted "neither with Craxi nor with [Democratic Party of the 
Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto," Craxi himself ("I have always 
been disciplined, I was called, and I came") answered Del Turco 
in harsh terms, dismissing his reaction as being "completely 
hysterical": "The group simply exercised a parliamentary right, 
which comes before any political stance. Since time immemorial, 
parliamentary groups have chosen their floor leader freely by 
means of a secret ballot, when they have deemed it appropriate 
to do so. That is all there is to it."

<F P=106> [Giorgio Battistini report: "We Against `il Biscione' -- </F>
Berlusconi nickname"] 
  [Text] Rome -- A rectangular table and two concentric 
circles. Such are the basic ingredients of the first agreement 
that is beginning to take shape among the progressives: A table 
to continue the talks which began yesterday in an excellent 
climate; two circles -- one of them within the other -- in order 
to explain that the aim is to achieve a broad-based political 
and electoral majority, as well as a more limited government 
majority. Some will be left outside. 
  Parties, groups, and movements within the progressive camp 
are agreed ("Nobody has excluded anybody," an overjoyed 
[Communist Renaissance Chairman] Cossutta said) on the first 
common circle. This will be a majority electoral pact opposed to 
the Right and more or less centrist in nature -- including 
[Fininvest President Silvio] Berlusconi, just imagine! They 
will all be together, therefore -- from AD [Democratic Alliance] 
to Communist Renaissance, the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left], the Greens, Rete, and others, too -- on the ballot paper 
through which voters will be initially asked to choose the 
government political majority only. A single symbol will be 
used -- who knows, perhaps a seagull under a logo which, since 
it will not be able to refer to "pacts" (Segni) or "forces" 
(Berlusconi), may include the term "alliance." Through the 
second ballot paper, as is well known, 25 percent of the seats 
will be fought for, namely, those that are assigned according to 
proportional representation: This is a key test with a view to 
assessing and processing residual or emergent party affinities. 
  Within the abovementioned great electoral circle, a more 
restricted area will take shape: that of a center-left 
government, including the proposed prime minister, the other 
principal ministers, and a united parliamentary group that will 
vote together on the basis of the agreed platform. Without 
being over-imaginative, we could speak of two separate tables. 
However, apart from being something of a stunt, the chosen 
formula expresses a real achievement: In order to stem the 
advance of the Right and of recycled oldtimers, the entire Left 
is gathering under a single electoral umbrella. When it comes 
to governing the country, the group of travelers becomes 
smaller: In fact, there is no unity among the traditional 
left-wing forces; there are huge gaps in the center; and, 
predictably, some will say "we cannot follow you," and will 
therefore exclude themselves. 
  A hundred meters away from the Quirinale [president's 
palace] 
as the crow flies, the European Parliament's Italian offices 
(favored by the Greens) witnessed the arrival of 23 people. The 
last one to turn up, shortly after 1 PM [1200 GMT], was [PDS 
Secretary Achille] Occhetto. "We are right on time and full of 
hope, whereas the others are divided, tormented, uncertain, and 
cutting each other's throats," he said as he came in. Although 
the offices are far from the usual venues for major political 
debates, a crowd was gathering, attracted by the presence of 
journalists and TV teams. The conclave lasted four hours, with 
fitting words being pronounced when the participants finally 
emerged. "I will not say this is a historical date, but it 
certainly is a great day," Occhetto said on everyone's behalf. 
A somewhat inappropriate stage design resulted in the places 
being allocated without any sense of electoral hierarchy. Thus 
the PDS found itself sitting in front of Cossutta and Magri; the 
Greens were at the head of the table, while AD and Gorrieri and 
Carniti's Christian-Socialists were far to the right. They had 
all skipped lunch, therefore sandwiches and mineral water were 
provided; Diego Novelli protested and, as a result, obtained "a 
small glass of white wine." In order to give the event 
historical significance, [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema passed a 
card around, to be signed by participants as proof of their 
attendance. Everybody liked the idea. For a few minutes, we 
saw a flurry of signing so as to testify: "I was there." 
  Indeed, the day had some significance. This was apparent 
also from the willingness to muffle any differences of opinion 
-- which nevertheless do exist -- and from emphasis being 
shifted to the upcoming meetings, when [Italian Socialist Party 
(PSI) Secretary] Del Turco and the PRI [Italian Republican 
Party] will join in (although Socialists and Republicans are 
already fairly well represented within AD). Thus an answer has 
been given to the agony and uncertainty that, in the form of the 
"opposing vetoes," had been dragging on since Christmas. The 
progressives have chosen the strategy of two places and two 
timescales. "There are forces and political ideas that can be 
united in an electoral coalition, but we also have different 
political projects which cannot be combined into a government 
agreement. We shall see what happens," AD spokesperson 
Ferdinando Adornato explained. Cossutta agreed curtly: "Of 
course, we shall see." He seemed confident that he could 
overcome internal problems. He is aiming for the government, 
even though in the end it might possibly be better for him to 
opt out of the more restricted political agreement. No doubt, 
however, his votes in the north are useful to the progressive 
coalition; just like Rete's votes in the south, the Greens' 
votes in the great towns; and those of the progressive Catholics 
throughout the country. If what we are witnessing is a game 
with a lit match, the purpose of which is to see who "dares" 
leave the anti-Right front, Cossutta is not one of them. He 
informed us that the PDS was joining forces with him, together 
with Rete and the Greens. Adornato was claiming instead that 
Occhetto proved that AD and the Christian-Socialists were right. 
In fact, it was their proposal that was adopted. This is the 
correct version, confirmed by Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters]. 
  These are but skirmishes aimed at broadening, through 
understandings and affinities, an internal contractual power 
which, in the darkness surrounding election forecasts, nobody 
can quantify -- skirmishes like those over Del Turco's and the 
PRI's expected arrival. [Rete Secretary] Orlando seemed to be 
opposed: "We are building a genuinely alternative force to the 
old regime. This negotiating table cannot serve the purposes of 
anyone's transformism." The Greens are hesitant and divided. 
Davide Visani, on the other hand, confirmed the PDS's 
"well-reasoned confidence" in Del Turco's attending the next 
summit, 10 days from now.

<F P=106> [Article by Franco Vernice: "Bossi Winds Up the Loser in TV </F>
Trial"] 
  [Text] The Lega under attack. The verdict of six 
"jurors" in the duel between Di Pietro and the senatur. 
  Mannheimer: "It was a serious blow for the Lega." 
Pontiggia: "It damaged their image." 
  Milan--Who was the victor in the televised Cusani trial? the 
solid Antonio Di Pietro from Montenero di Bisaccia or the lively 
Umberto Bossi from Cassano Magnago? Or wouldn't it be fairer to 
declare it a tie? No, says our ideal jury. Once the televisions 
were turned off and the newspapers set aside, this was no tie: 
Bossi was defeated, even on technicalities. He limited the 
damage, but he still lost. Let us hear from our first juror, 
sociologist and Lega expert Renato Mannheimer: "During the 
trial, each played their own role, but Bossi is in serious 
trouble politically because he will now be lumped together with 
all the others. This event will cause him great harm in his 
field." 
  Who could profit from the Lega leader problems? Mannheimer 
immediately names two of his most direct competitors among the 
moderates: "Berlusconi and Segni, but...." But what? "But we 
will have to see if they are able to capitalize on the 
situation." And how did the fighter Bossi do in the courtroom? 
According to Mannheimer: "He tried to act like someone who does 
not know the law in order to escape from it." Did he succeed? " 
It would be interesting to determine what impact his deposition 
had on the Leghists, but unfortunately I have no data." And what 
does the sociologist Mannheimer think of this televised trial, 
which was able to draw as many viewers as the music festival of 
Sanremo? "The trial reflects the transition from the First to 
the Second Republic. It is history as it happens, and that is 
the way it should be, without the intervention of either the 
professors or the journalists." 
  Even the architect Gae Aulenti thinks Wednesday "was not a 
very good day for leader Umberto Bossi. It came out that the 
Lega definitely did take money. However, someone who is unable 
to form a subtle opinion of Bossi may very well continue to 
follow him through thick and thin." Ornella Vanoni, who is busy 
on tour these days, was unable to watch the Cusani trial on 
television. However, she also sees clouds forming on the horizon 
for the Lega and the senatur:: "They admitted talking 
the money, right? I think their reputation will be damaged 
because people used to think they were angels. Not me, because I 
have never believed in angels." 
  The writer Giuseppe Pontiggia says he was made uneasy by 
what 
he saw on television: "I felt embarrassed. The Lega's good name 
was muddied because they were unable to avoid committing 
wrongful deeds, although they are hardly to be compared to those 
committed by the others. The problem is that if someone wants to 
offer an alternative model, then they have to know how to behave 
coherently." However, the novelist feels that Umberto Bossi may 
have to pay a dearer price to the voters for his political 
vacillations and awful language than for the 200 million lire 
received from Montedison. But is it a good thing or a bad thing 
to gather round to watch a trial as if it were a theatrical 
production, or even a boxing match? Pontiggia says: "Drama is 
part of the particular period we are in, and I believe it is 
almost inevitable that this is the way it should be, even though 
from a strictly judicial point of view, we may have gone too 
far." 
  The painter Enrico Baj, cultural councilor on the Lega town 
council of Varese for a few days, until he resigned amidst 
controversy, is adamantly against televised justice: "In Italy, 
there used to be the commedia dell'arte, or comedy of art, but 
today we have the comedy of justice, with everyone up there 
trying to look good." Did Bossi achieve his goal? "He played the 
populist, as always, which will eventually weaken Bossi the 
politician. At first he gathered the protest vote, but now the 
people want more. The Lega has either not known how, nor been 
able, to create a valid base for itself that was independent of 
the impromptu brainstorms of its leader. Also, when these same 
Leghists went to Rome, they started acting like the Romans." But 
Bossi did earn some points in court, didn't he? "Bossi should 
have limited himself to admitting his guilt and then kept 
silent. Instead, he behaved like a driver who, when he is caught 
redhanded by a policeman in a strictly no parking zone, still 
finds something to argue about. I do not understand why he 
agreed to play this part." 
  Mario Rodriguez, campaign expert and authority on political 
communications, offers another interpretation of the 
confrontation between Di Pietro and Bossi: "The public 
prosecutor looked straight at the camera, totally aware of the 
dramatic role he was playing. Instead, I thought Bossi was more 
spontaneous, but also more uncouth. In the end, I think I 
understood that certain things--certain behaviors--which today 
we all think are illegal, were standard procedure in 1992, which 
no one could escape, not even--although to a very small 
degree--the Lega. And I also realized that, deep down, the new 
Bossi has an old face. In any event, I believe that this 
demonstration will not affect his showing in the elections by 
more than 5 percent. On the other hand, we still have to see 
what influence the presence of Mario Segni and Silvio Berlusconi 
will have on him.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonio Calabro: "Silvio and the Nested Chinese </F>
Boxes"] 
  [Text] Milan--Controversy in Fininvest. Doubts 
expressed regarding Fininvest's property. 
  AVVENIRE calls the 45 percent share of the company a 
"mystery," and Berlusconi's people threaten to sue. 
  Who owns Fininvest? Why, Silvio Berlusconi, right? To get to 
Berlusconi, however, you have to pass through a filter of 22 
companies--Holding Italiana One, then Two, Three, and so on, in 
boring progression, all the way to Holding Italiana Twenty-two. 
Some of these companies, which in business and financial jargon 
are called "empty boxes," are in the hands of two trustees: 
Servizio Italia of BNL [National Bank of Labor] and Parmafid of 
Milan. A study of this tight, complicated network of holdings 
reveals that only 50.35 percent of Fininvest is held "directly" 
by Berlusconi, while the rest is managed as a trust by Servizio 
Italia (exactly 45.8 percent) and by Parmafid. The figures were 
supplied in an investigative report published yesterday by the 
Catholic daily, AVVENIRE, which is full of new information (we 
have known about the 22 boxes for some time, but the exact 
figures on the shares held by the trustees had never been made 
public). Why do they need to play this game of Chinese boxes? 
AVVENIRE spoke of "mysteries" and of "a troublesome atmosphere 
of ambiguity and embarrassing cunning surrounding Fininvest." 
And although it does not want "to join the ranks of those who 
suspect the existence of a mysterious secret partner behind 
Berlusconi's success," the daily does reveal how the "empty 
boxes" serve to provide the companies with substantial tax 
advantages and are a "perfect system for avoiding taxes." 
  Berlusconi's people did not like this report one bit. In a 
letter sent by Fininvest Communications to the AVVENIRE 
publisher, they maintained that "100 percent of the Group's 
ownership is directly or indirectly in the hands of the 
Berlusconi family"; reminded him that authorities and the 
financial world have known for more than a decade about how 
Fininvest's capital stock was structured"; insisted that the 
trusteeships are a "perfectly legitimate" instrument"; affirmed 
that "documents and disclosures had been provided to CONSOB 
[Commission for the Supervision of Companies and Stock 
Exchanges], their backers, and the Revenue Guards; and, lastly, 
stated that the investigation "did not discover anything new or 
wrong." Therefore, it was a "deliberate contribution to the 
press's attempt to misinform and denigrate Silvio Berlusconi for 
obvious political ends." That was the letter. But Fininvest also 
let it be known that they are evaluating possible "legal 
actions" against those who want to "use" the story of the 22 
companies to make insinuations about "secret partners." 
  So, there will be no lack of controversy, which is likely to 
be centered mostly around the issues of taxation. Although the 
game of trading off the earnings and losses of various companies 
is routinely used by businesses to avoid paying excessive taxes 
on earnings and although "avoiding" taxes is legitimate (using 
all the legal tax loopholes is called "avoiding taxes"), it 
becomes a different story when the entrepreneur--in this case, 
Berlusconi--enters politics and wages one of his first campaigns 
against "high taxes." 
  But let us take a closer look at the story of the trustees. 
Last December, Mediobanca, which organizes the shareholding 
structures and the budget statements of the leading Italian 
companies, reported that "the entire capital stock of Fininvest 
is directly or indirectly in the hands of Silvio Berlusconi." 
Armed with Mediobanca's judgment, the people at Fininvest are 
insisting that "everything is clear, everything belongs to the 
Doctor (as Berlusconi is deferentially referred to at 
headquarters in Arcore). The network of holdings, however, is 
intricate. "It was set up 15 years ago and sooner or later we 
may change it, but enough of these suspicions. There is nothing 
mysterious here," explodes Fedele Confalonieri who will become 
the chairman of Fininvest if and when Berlusconi decides to 
enter politics directly. 
  So let us go back 15 years, to June 1978, when two tax 
accountants, Armando Minna and Nicla [as published] Crocitto, 
set up the 22 holding companies for Silvio Berlusconi with a 
sole director, Luigi Foscale, Berlusconi's uncle and the father 
of Giancarlo Foscale, the current president of the Standa chain. 
Still in 1978, two trustees of the BNL (which at that time was 
headed by the Socialist Nerio Nesi, who was then replaced in 
1989 by another Socialist, Giampiero Cantoni), that is, the 
Servizio Italia and SAF [expansion unknown], were involved in 
the creation of Fininvest Roma, which in turn would incorporate 
Fininvest Milano. Servizio Italia is still being used. It holds 
trustee management ("passive, or nonoperational management," BNL 
points out) of 42 percent of Fininvest's capital stock to which 
must be added an additional 3 percent, if you consider Holding 
Italiana Seven's 55 percent, in order to arrive at the 45 
percent we mentioned in the beginning of this article. Parmafid 
is also in the picture. It is a trustee headquartered at 2 Via 
Sant'Orsola in Milan and its director is the accountant Roberto 
Massimo Filippa. Parmafid controls 49 percent of Fininvest's 
Holding Italiana One and 10 percent of Holdings Two, Three, 
Four, Five, Twenty-one, and Twenty-two. The total is just over 4 
percent of Fininvest and, thus, the figures add up. 
  Why does Fininvest play this game of holdings and 
trusteeships? One explanation can be found if we look at three 
of the companies in this tangle: Nodit, Sodif (former Gaumont 
Italia), and Videotrading (former Costa, a "tax haven" of Costa 
Shipbuilders that Berlusconi bought in 1987). All three were 
loaded with debts, and the rather strong earnings in early years 
from the television rights paid by the Fininvest networks were, 
to a large extent, written off against their losses. In November 
1992, L'ESPRESSO stated that in a few years' time "180 billion 
lire had passed from Fininvest to Berlusconi without being 
subject to taxation." It was all legal, of course, just like in 
so many other respectable companies.

  [Text] Genoa, Italy, Jan 14 (AFP) -- Police Friday [14 
January] said they had arrested 23 Italians, including one who 
made a spectacular break from a U.S. jail, on suspicion of 
running heroin from Turkey and cocaine from Colombia. 
  They were said to be part of a 70-strong gang linked to the 
Mafia in southern Italy and Colombia's Medellin Cartel. 
  Among those arrested was Sicilian Umberto Pitino, 49, who 
was 
detained in 1991 when authorities smashed the so-called pizza 
connection in the United States. He escaped by helicopter from 
Raleigh jail in North Carolina with the aid of a Colombian drug 
producer. 
  Police said cocaine totalling 20 kilos (44 pounds) had been 
smuggled from Colombia aboard a ship hidden in musical 
instruments or navigational apparatus.

  [Text] After mutual diplomatic recognition between the Holy 
See and Israel, a PLO delegation went to the Vatican today to 
outline the position and concerns of the Palestinians. 
According to the PLO, this diplomatic initiative cannot but 
concern negotiations taking place on the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
Giuseppe De Carli reports: 
  [De Carli] The PLO is asking the Vatican to set up a 
permanent bilateral commission to define relations between the 
Holy See and the Palestinian people, between the Catholic and 
Islamic communities in the Holy Land. The PLO delegation, led 
by Muhammad Zuhdi [Muhammad Zuhayr al-Nashashibi], Yasir 
'Arafat's diplomatic adviser, was received this morning by 
Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the Holy See's foreign minister, 
and Claudio Maria Celli, his deputy. 
  The Palestinians are also asking for an agreement similar to 
the 30 December 1993 agreement that ratified the formalization 
of relations between the Holy See and Israel and their mutual 
diplomatic recognition. There has still been no official PLO 
reaction to this agreement, but it has been judged premature and 
inopportune by some Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
However, it is noted that the Palestinian delegation has not 
come to Rome to protest, but to build a fuller relationship with 
the Vatican. At the center of the talks are ways to apply the 
agreement on Gaza and Jericho and, above all, the matter of the 
holy city of Jerusalem. The PLO delegation welcomed the request 
the pope made, during his address to the diplomatic corps, for a 
special statute for Jerusalem, a spiritual reference point for 
the believers of the three great monotheistic religions. 
  A communique from the Vatican press office, released just a 
few minutes ago, said the meeting heralds the beginning of a 
more official dialogue between the Holy See and Palestinian 
representatives. Further, the PLO expressed its appreciation of 
the work carried out by the Catholic Church for peace and 
collaboration between all peoples in the region.

  [Text] Let us now listen to the reaction of the French 
foreign minister to the killing. Alain Juppe spoke to Farida 
Ayari a few minutes ago, as soon as he arrived in South Africa: 
  [Begin recording] [Juppe, in progress] ...my outrage at this 
odious killing. We immediately took the necessary steps with 
the Algerian authorities. Our ambassador has been received by 
Prime Minister Redha Malek. As you know, we had taken 
significant security measures, but of course, because the French 
community in Algeria is so scattered, no security system is 50 
percent efficient, or even 40 percent, as I said earlier. 
Unfortunately, this was proven true the hard way. 
  [Ayari] Will you be taking other steps? 
  [Juppe] Of course. In particular we are going to try to find 
out how we can reduce the number of staff at our official 
facilities, so that civil servants are exposed as little as 
possible. [end recording] 
  Asked whether France would close its consulate in Algeria, 
Alain Juppe answered, I quote, we have not reached that stage 
yet.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The commander of UN forces in 
former Yugoslavia, French General Jean Cot, may be replaced in 
the next few weeks, French officials said here on Monday [17 
January]. 
  A decision on replacing Cot, in command of the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) since July 1, is up to the United Nations, the 
officials said. 
  Cot is at present on leave in France for family reasons. 
  He was reprimanded last week by UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali for stepping out of line by urging NATO airstrikes 
against Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Known for his plain-speaking, Cot made repeated calls for 
special powers to carry out air strikes, whereas under a May 
1993 Security Council resolution only Butrus-Ghali has 
authority to call on North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air 
power. 
  Last week the secretary-general criticised Cot for his 
public 
remarks and for pressuring governments so as to be able to call 
in air strikes. 
  Butrus-Ghali has opposed air strikes for fear of reprisals 
against UN peacekeepers and of disagreements in the Security 
Council where Russia is opposed to any escalation of the 
Yugoslav conflict.

<F P=106> [Communique jointly released by the Presidential Office and </F>
the Prime Minister's Office the evening of 11 January on the 
devaluation of the CFA franc] 
  [Text] The heads of state and of government of the African 
countries in the franc zone have decided to modify the parity of 
the CFA franc and the Comoran franc in relation to the French 
franc. France has given its agreement to this decision which 
aims to restore the right conditions for lasting economic growth 
by enabling the resumption of international funding. This 
decision will consolidate the recovery efforts in which many 
countries in the franc zone are already involved. 
  France, which is in the front rank of the international 
financial community, will not fail to show its solidarity with 
its partners. To this end, it will closely follow and 
participate in the implementation of the necessary accompaying 
measures, particularly those intended to support the most 
underprivileged populations. 
  France will step up its effort to promote economic and 
social 
development. New measures to cancel and reduce the debt have 
also been decided in continuation of the action taken in this 
sphere by President Francois Mitterrand. These different 
measures bear witness to France's resolute and tangible support 
for the franc zone and to the preferential ties it maintains 
with its partners."

<F P=106> [Report signed "A.V.": "Major Framework Accord in Sight for </F>
France Telecom in Vietnam"] 
  [Text] France Telecom reportedly is about to sign a 
framework cooperation accord with the Vietnamese postal and 
telecommunications authorities involving the installation of 
300,000 to 500,000 telephone lines within a three-year period. 
The accord represents an investment of approximately 3-5 
billion French francs. It will be announced during Industry 
Minister Gerard Longuet's visit to Vietnam, and it will be 
initialed by France Telecom President Marcel Roulet and his 
Vietnamese counterpart in Hanoi in late February. 
  For the moment, the French telecommunications operator has 
restricted itself to acknowledging that "the ministry has 
prepared a memorandum of cooperation." The legal aspects of the 
agreement remain to be defined. This accord would move France 
from fourth to second place among foreign investors in the SRV, 
following Taiwan ($1.5 billion in capital investments), but 
ahead of Hong Kong and South Korea. There are four legal 
formulas for foreign investments in Vietnam: a simple 
cooperation contract; a 100-percent subsidiary; a joint venture 
with minimum foreign participation of 30 percent; and the BOT 
(Build Operate Transfer), which stipulates the transfer of the 
foreign partner's operations to the Vietnamese state after a 
specified period of time. The Vietnamese partner favors the 
last formula, whereas France Telecom prefers a joint venture.

<F P=106> [Editorial:"Improved Relations Between France and China"] </F>
  [Text] There are two possible interpretations of the joint 
communique released on 12 January by France and China to 
announce that after deteriorating relations between the two 
coutries, in the wake of the sale of Mirage aircraft to Taiwan, 
relations are now back to normal. For Beijing, the communique 
means that France has agreed to all Chinese demands, promising 
not to sign new armament contracts with Taiwan in exchange for 
an end to trade sanctions. So Deng Xiaoping's intransigence 
seems to have paid off. 
  Unsurprisingly, Paris' interpretation is quite different, to 
say the least, which shows the benefits -- or the limitations -- 
of the equivocal diplomatic language. In order to patch up 
relations with China, which had gone sour as a result of his 
socialist predecessors's action, and above all because of the 
sale of Mirage aircraft to Taiwan, Mr. Balladur has agreed to 
take into account China's political needs, but reserves the 
right to use a -- small -- way out: France may approve some 
arms sales provided they are not considered as threatening -- 
and offensive -- for China. Still according to Paris, then, 
French firmness would have prevailed. 
  In fact, both sides needed to unlock the situation. Paris 
wanted to cut its trade balance deficit and give French 
companies a new chance to do business in China. Above all, it 
wanted to reestablish relations with one of the world's foremost 
political, military, and economic powers, and not be cut off 
from the huge Chinese market. 
  For China -- which has been squabbling with the United 
States 
over human rights, trade, and exports of atomic and missile 
technology; and which is currently in a row with Britain over 
Hong Kong -- restoring friendly ties with France was a way of 
putting an end to a certain isolation. 
  So all is well that ends well. Provided Mr. Balladur manages 
to meet expectations aroused during his visit to China "in the 
near future." In the meantime, he has asked Mr. Peyrefitte 
[former minister of De Gaule] to be the first one to go to 
Beijing. But will the latter be able to convey the French 
determination to his hosts in such a way that they give up any 
hope of brazenly pressuring Paris into accepting their point of 
view in the future? 
  One would be mistaken to believe in a necessarily bright 
future. The Chinese have shown in just how little regard they 
hold their promises of trade advantages. The eagerness to enter 
the fray demonstrated by French companies already counting aloud 
the billions of francs they stand to make does not strike one as 
particularly appropriate. Beijing -- convinced that 
"hypocritical" Western concerns for human rights will eventually 
be superseded by greed -- is bound to take advantage of it to 
raise the stakes. Subsequently, other large industrial powers 
such as Germany will have to be reckoned with.

[13 January], attacking conservative Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur and cheering on the left ahead of a massive

  The socialist president condemned Balladur's "unfortunate

unlimited use of public funds to the country's private, mainly 
Catholic, schools. 
  In an interview with the socialist weekly VENDREDI, 
Mitterrand said the state education system felt unfairly treated 
and that he "understood" the anger of teachers and parents. 
  Teachers unions and parents associations as well as 
left-wing 
organisations are planning a big demonstration against the new 
legislation on Sunday and hope to draw 300,000 people on to the 
Paris boulevards. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Varley] </F>
  [Text] Paris, Jan 14 (AFP) -- The French left is pressing 
ahead with plans for a massive demonstration here on Sunday [16 
January] after claiming victory in a row with the conservative 
government over private school funding. 
  The left hoped to convert a try into a goal after the nine 
"wise men" of France's constitutional court cancelled the key 
part of a controversial education bill that had revived the 
country's long-running "schools war." 
  The Paris demonstration was originally planned to protest 
the 
new legislation which granted unlimited use of public funds to 
the country's private, mainly Catholic, schools. 
  But the court slapped it down, ruling that the central 
article of the bill was unconstitutional because it upset the 
balance between the state and private school systems. 
  A crowd of between 300,000 and 350,000 was expected to march 
through the city for most of the day on Sunday, grouping 
teachers, students and parents' associations, trade unions and 
freemasons as well as socialists and communists. 
  Organisers hired 66 special trains and 1,800 buses to bring 
demonstrators into the capital from the provinces. 
  The court ruling was the left's first victory over 
conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur since it was 
heavily defeated in legislative elections last March. 
  Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard is eager to capitalise 
on the win as his party prepares for a series of conferences 
aimed at building a broad centre-left coalition ahead of next 
year's presidential elections. 
  Rocard termed the ruling a "victory" for the left and 
renewed 
his calls for a big turnout on Sunday. 
  Balladur, who had come under fire from both left and right 
after the education bill was rushed through the senate last 
month in the middle of the night, beat a hasty retreat after the 
court ruling. 
  Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said it would be 
"imprudent" to submit a new education bill for the moment while 
Education Minister Francois Bayrou called for "dialogue" and 
said he wanted to "restore the self-confidence of the state 
education system." 
  One reason for going ahead with Sunday's demonstration was 
the difficulty of calling it off at short notice, but Balladur 
will be carefully watching the turnout and hoping that the 
cancellation of the law will dampen enthusiasm. 
  It was undoubtedly a reversal for the prime minister but 
this 
was preferable to being forced to defend an increasingly 
indefensible corner, analysts said. 
  Although Balladur has been consistently popular in opinion 
polls since become prime minister in April, the schools law was 
definitely unpopular, with most people believing that additional 
funds for private schools could only come at the expense of the 
public school system. 
  Polls this week showed that 50 percent of the French thought 
the law was wrong against 34 percent who approved of it. 
Another poll said that 40 percent supported Sunday's 
demonstration, with 21 percent against and 30 percent undecided. 
  Socialist President Francois Mitterrand waded into the 
controversy on Thursday, attacking Balladur for his "unfortunate 
initiative" and cheering on the left. 
  Worse still, the bill was also criticised on the right. 
Jacques Chirac, leader of Balladur's own neo-Gaullist Rally for 
the Republic (RPR) party and a rival to the prime minister as 
possible candidate in 1995 presidential elections, said he 
"understands perfectly" that there were "reservations" about the 
way the bill was voted. 
  Former conservative prime minister Raymond Barre strongly 
attacked it as "a signal blunder" and called for a new 
parliamentary debate. National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin 
weighed in with an ode in praise of the secular education system. 
  Balladur counterattacked, allocating 440 million dollars for 
urgent repairs in state schools while arguing that the bill was 
an "act of fairness" and "an election promise that had to be 
kept." 
  That cash will still be spent, amid general relief in the 
government that the constitutional court got it off the hook.

  [Excerpt] Paris, Jan 15 (AFP) -- Hundreds of thousands of 
people are expected to demonstrate in support of public schools 
Sunday [16 January] after France's top court struck down a law 
on private school funding, handing Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur his first serious political setback. 
  Organisers were hoping for between 100,000 and 300,000 
supporters on the march through Paris in a demonstration called 
before Thursday's Constitutional Court ruling annulled a 
controversial education bill that granted unlimited use of 
public funds to the country's private, mainly Roman Catholic 
schools. 
  The court ruled that the central article of the bill was 
unconstitutional because it upset the balance between the state 
and private school systems. 
  The protest was expected to attract teachers, students and 
parents' associations, trade unionists and freemasons as well as 
socialists and communists. 
  The court ruling was the left's first victory over the 
conservative premier since its crushing defeat in general 
elections last March, and the opposition Socialist party hopes 
to use the march as a springboard to revive its political 
fortunes. 
  In an effort to soothe passions unleashed by France's 
long-running "school wars," Balladur indicated Friday that he 
wanted to launch a public debate on "the future of the public 
education system," its funding and organisation. 
  Socialist leader Michel Rocard is eager to capitalise on the 
win as his party prepares for a series of conferences aimed at 
building a broad centre-left coalition ahead of next year's

  [Excerpts] Paris, Jan 16 (AFP) -- A mass demonstration in 
support of public schools got underway in Paris Sunday [16 
January] with up to 500,000 people joining the march despite a 
court ruling that struck down a controversial private schools 
financing law. 
  The demonstration, set to begin at 1000 GMT, was delayed a 
half hour because of the amount of people joining the procession 
which began under a cold drizzle from the Place de la Republique 
to the Place de la Nation. It was expected to last until the 
end of the afternoon. 
  Hundreds of buses had arrived in the capital overnight 
Saturday carrying teachers from the provinces and the state 
railway system had also scheduled dozens of special trains. 
[passage omitted] 
  Several union and political leaders headed the procession 
Sunday including Socialist leader Michel Rocard and Communist 
leader Georges Marchais. 
  Union officials said they wanted some "serious negotiations" 
with the government and that they would ask Balladur to pass a 
law setting up a special budget for education. 
  The demonstrators carried banners that read "Republic, 
public 
schools," and shouted the same slogan. 
  Several placards demanded the resignation of the minister of 
education, Francois Bayrou, who had pushed for the private 
schools financing law and has since come under strong criticism. 
  Union leader Marc Blondel said Bayrou was obviously a 
partisan of private schools. 
  "No one has the right to say that we provoked this, it's not 
true," Blondel said. "It's Bayrou who provoked it." 
  Several opposition members also did not hide the fact that 
they would use the issue to try and mobilise support for their 
cause especially after the crushing defeat suffered by the 
socialists during last year's legislative elections. [passage

  [Text] Paris, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Education Minister Francois 
Bayrou said Monday [17 January] he would not resign despite 
calls for his ouster during a mammoth demonstration here Sunday 
to protest his plan for unlimited financing of private schools 
by local authorities. 
  "One does not serve as education minister if one cannot 
handle a crisis. One should not be a sailor if one is seasick," 
he said in interview with the radio station Europe 1. 
  Bayrou said he did not think that the leftist-backed 
demonstration, which drew hundreds of thousands of people from 
all over France, signaled a resurgence of the leftist 
opposition, which had seemed demoralized since its defeat at the 
polls last March. 
  "One should not look at what happened yesterday in strictly 
political terms," he noted. "We do not want this to become a 
pretext for playing politics in order to revive a struggling 
political party or politicians who are responsible for the 
current state of French schools." 
  He also backed a proposal by Socialist Party Michel Rocard 
to 
convene a national forum on education. 
  Organisers said the demonstration drew more than one 
million, 
although police set the figure much lower. But the number of 
participants seemed well in excess of the 350,000 originally 
expected by organisers. 
  The demonstrators, many of whom arrived aboard dozens of 
special trains and thousands of buses, waved banners calling for 
the resignation of Education Minister Francois Bayrou, beat 
drums, blew whistles and played bagpipes under grey skies and 
drizzling rain. 
  The protest was called to denounce a reform of the financing 
of private, mainly Catholic schools, adopted by parliament in 
December and it drew on France's deeply ingrained anti-clerical 
tradition on the left. 
  The new legislation was annulled Thursday as inegalitarian 
by 
the constitutional court, France's highest constitutional 
authority.

  [Text] [Robin] The recession is over, but recovery has 
not yet started. How can this interim period be described? 
  [Alphandery] It is a transitional phase and therefore has 
highs and lows, and variable results according to the sectors. 
The United States experienced that in 1992 before returning to 
clear growth. Getting out of a recession is always 
characterized by up- and downward movements. In France, the 
economy certainly grew very modestly and at a rate which was 
scarcely perceptible in the second and third quarters of 1993 
(up 0.2 percent in each), whereas the beginning of the fourth 
quarter was marked by an upsurge in activity. 
<H5>  Positive Signs </H5>
  [Robin] What signs now make you feel fairly optimistic and 
which suggest that the lowest point has really been passed? 
  [Alphandery] There are at least two positive signs. First, 
the order and export sales books are filling up considerably, 
which reflects both an improvement in the international 
environment and the high level of competitiveness which our 
products have. Moreover, the demand for houses is improving; in 
September, October, and November, there was a 10-percent 
increase in new homes started, and planning applications for new 
houses increased by 12 percent over the previous three months. 
  Another encouraging sign is that inquiries into the economic 
situation among corporate managers show a return of optimism. 
Better prospects for economic activity are emerging, especially 
in the opinion poll carried out very recently by the small- and 
medium- sized enterprises' capital fund. 
  [Robin] Surely the most worrying sign on this instrument 
panel is the psychological factor, the feeling of anxiety which 
is prompting a kind of consumption stop. 
  [Alphandery] It is true that consumer spending has become 
irregular for some time. It had increased by 0.6 to 0.7 percent 
in the second and third quarters and was moving in the wrong 
direction at the beginning of the fall. It is increasing partly 
thanks to the sales. We will closely monitor the consumer 
figures for December and January when there are widespread 
promotional sales, in order to form a more accurate view of the 
trend. 
<H5>  Confidence a Key Factor </H5>
  [Alphandery continues] The confidence felt by households and 
managers chiefs is obviously a key factor in the recovery. The 
change in climate will come as progress is made. The strong 
reduction in interest rates, which we recorded, has begun to 
produce positive effects, particularly by reducing the 
enterprises' financial costs. In this context of a gradual 
return of confidence, our economic growth forecasts of 1.4 
percent in 1994 have no reason to be changed for the time being. 
Among other things, they are based on an expected 0.7-percent 
increase in household consumption, which is, after all, modest. 
It is modest because it would be enough, for intance, for the 
French to turn just 5 percent of their savings in SICAV's 
[Open-End Investment Company] into consumer spending to achieve 
this increase. 
  [Robin] Are the French leaders right to constantly highlight 
international constraints, as if we really had no freedom to 
solve our own problems? Why stick to what is happening in 
Germany, is this not a resigned attitude? 
  [Alphandery] It is important to realize that, in our 
economies, which are very open to the outside world, it is not 
possible to pursue an economic policy which runs completely 
counter to the international environment. The unfortunate 
experience of 1981 must serve as a lesson. Of course, the 
situation in Germany, which is our main customer, is not very 
buoyant. Growth there will be at best between 0 and 1 percent 
this year. But, fortunately, there are other parts of the world 
which are attracting foreign demand: The recovery in North 
America is considerable and it is already having beneficial 
effects in France and in Europe. 
<H5>  Crediblity Restored </H5>
  [Alphandery continues] Moreover, there are means of action, 
even in the present context. And we cannot be accused of doing 
nothing. Despite little financial room to maneuver, we have 
succeeded in pursuing an imaginative policy of supporting 
economic activity by mobilizing short-term saving by the French 
people. That has been done in particular through the Balladur 
loan issue which served as an interim measure, pending 
privatizations, to finance measures to promote the housing 
sector and the small- and medium- sized enterprises in 
particular. Finally, we have taken significant measures to 
ensure the recovery of state and social security accounts. 
  These provisions, which are certainly painful at the start, 
have not been without effect. For instance, the credibility 
restored to our monetary policy has made it possible to 
virtually wipe out our interest rate differential with Germany. 
In so doing, we have succeeded in creating a more favorable 
climate for recovery. 
  [Robin] The French people have only recently rediscovered 
the market economy and its cyclical fluctuations, which are 
well-known facts in the United States. What are you saying to 
them to make them accept that such developments are normal and 
are better than the rigid and interventionist economic system 
which has prevailed in our country since 1945? 
  [Alphandery] The previous recession in France dates back to 
1975 and was the result of the first oil crisis. When the world 
was suffering the effects of the second oil crisis in the early 
eighties, France thought it could escape them by pursuing a 
counter-cyclical policy. It must be admitted that the recession 
was avoided temporarily but at what a cost! It subsequently 
gave us permanently slower growth. Our economy only returned to 
cruising speed from 1988, whereas the United States, Germany, 
and Japan returned to growth as early as 1983. 
  [Robin] The recession of the nineties lasted three years, 
assuming it is now over. Does it not reflect more fundamental 
problems? What is this feeling of doom which prevails among 
many French people? 
  [Alphandery] The recession appears to be so painful in our 
country because it is accompanied by the need to tackle some 
major structural problems, especially on the employment front. 
The two phenomena must not be confused. In 1988, amid economic 
euphoria, France already had a 9-percent unemployment rate, much 
higher than in Germany and the United States. The Japanese 
economy experienced a serious recession in 1993. And yet the 
unemployment rate is still around 2.5 percent. 
  [Robin] The prime minister has just admitted that "the 
crisis is even worse than we thought when we came to power." In 
what respect in particular? 
  [Alphandery] In March 1993, everybody still underestimated 
the scale of the recession which we had inherited. It had grown 
considerably worse from fall 1992. We only realized that six 
months later when the final figures for the fourth quarter of 
1992 and the first quarter of 1993 were known. 
<H5>  Not In Favor of Social VAT </H5>
  [Alphandery continues] It is clear that the employment 
problem will not automatically be solved with the end of the 
recession. The Giraud law's five-year employment plan clearly 
identified the three key factors on which we must take action. 
First, the lack of flexibility in the job market; the law 
contains several initial responses on this point, like the 
annual calculation of working hours or the services voucher. 
Second, the lack of professional qualification. Hence the 
training-in-the-job contracts [contrats d'insertion]. Finally, 
the efforts to reduce social security contributions on low 
wages: 10 billion francs [Fr] have been allocated to that in 
the 1994 budget. 
  We must just take care to ensure that the remedies do not 
have contraindications which would be likely to cancel out their 
positive effects. Would not an increase in VAT to finance new 
reductions in social security contributions now reduce 
consumption, the rate of which we must, instead, sustain? That 
is why I am not campaigning for a social VAT. 
  [Robin] The government's economic policy was primarily 
aimed at restoring a balance to the public accounts. You wanted 
to restore confidence in the French people worried at seeing the 
deficits threatening their social security system. This was the 
reason for increasing the CSG [general social contribution]. 
Does the result live up to your expectations? 
  [Alphandery] I think so; we obviously first had to reassure 
the French people about the future of their social security. As 
for the increase in the CSG, by helping to restore credibility 
to our economic policy, it made it easier to reduce interest 
rates. This resulted in savings of Fr60 billion for the 
enterprises and Fr15 billion for the state. What would have 
happened without that? 
  [Robin] Some economists are accusing the government of 
emphasizing a policy of supply to overcome the crisis, whereas 
it is demand which is lacking. Francois Mitterrand has taken up 
this idea, referring to the Fr80 billion given to the 
enterprises without any effects on employment. What is your 
answer? 
  [Alphandery] It is true that we have made a considerable 
effort, especially with regard to the small- and medium-sized 
enterprises, through the reimbursement of VAT. In so doing we 
have been able to avoid additional bankruptcies, as is shown by 
the trend recorded in the last months of 1993 when the number of 
bankruptcies fell. At the same time, we took several important 
measures to help households; families not liable for tax 
received a higher grant for the beginning of the new school 
year, and income tax has been reduced by Fr19 billion. 
  The balance between supporting demand and strengthening 
supply seems satisfactory, because we must prepare the ground 
for a healthy recovery. 
  [Robin] On another front, you have been accused of pursuing 
a monetary policy which does not correspond to the internal 
requirements of the French economy which would have justified a 
larger cut in interest rates, or even a devaluation of the 
franc. Do you think the debate is finally over? 
  [Alphandery] The interest rate cut made over the past nine 
months is impressive. France is now among the countries with 
the lowest rates in Europe. This is particularly true for 
long-term rates of between 2 and 10 years with which the 
enterprises and the state can finance themselves for a rate of 
less than 6 percent. With regard to shorter-term rates, the 
reduction in interest rates is continuing, and we are already 
very close to countries like Britain which devalued their 
currencies in the hope of securing lower interest rates. I note 
that those economies have short-term rates of more than 5 
percent, whereas the United States and Japan have been able to 
reduce their interest rates to 3 percent or less. Nobody in 
Europe has managed to do that yet. It is a difficult fact to 
explain but one which affects everybody. 
  [Robin] The deterioration in public deficits has been abrupt 
in France, so much so that those deficits are now relatively 
higher than in Germany, according to OECD estimates. How do you 
explain this phenomenon? Is the French economy, with its very 
high compulsory contributions, impossible to manage in a period 
of recession? 
  [Alphandery] Our predecessors gave us a poisoned chalice 
with public and social security deficits much higher than 
expected. Such deficits are worrying and they must be 
eradicated, which we have started to do at the cost of 
temporarily increasing the compulsory contributions. But, 
ultimately, we must have the aim of reducing the compulsory 
contributions which are an obstacle to the creation of wealth 
and a source of unemployment. Hence the five-year plan to 
reduce the budget deficit which aims essentially to control 
public spending. 
  We should beware of comparisons with our partners. Taking 
all spending into account, the public deficit in France is no 
higher that we are seeing in Germany, in particular.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Installation of the Monetary </F>
Policy Council: Balladur Declares That Central Bank 
Independence Aids Franc's Credibility"] 
  [Text] "An independent Central Bank is still not a deaf and 
blind Central Bank, or an institution which would be oddly 
located outside of the field of democracy," declared Jean-Claude 
Trichet, governor of the Central Bank on Friday, 7 January, on 
the occasion of the installation of the Monetary Policy Council, 
which took place in the presence of Balladur and Alphandery. 
  "The independent central banks in all the other countries 
must, under one form or another, support the general economic 
policy of the country without, of course, prejudicing their 
monetary independence. This is what French law says (...). This 
is also what German law says and, finally, it's what the 
Maastricht Treaty says." 
  "Likewise, communication between the executive power and the 
central bank will be natural," continued Mr. Trichet, alluding 
to the possible participation in council meetings--without 
voting rights--of the prime minister and the minister of 
economy. "In countries which are deeply attached to the 
independence of the central bank, this direct communication 
between the government and the monetary authority occurs 
naturally and bears no prejudice against the independence of the 
monetary institution which alone decides, within the law, that 
is, without receiving or soliciting instructions from anyone." 
  "The independence of the Central Bank permits improvement of 
the efficacy of price stability policy, aids the international 
credibility of our money, and at the same time gives our economy 
the best financial environment possible," declared Balladur 
afterward. "I've always thought that the stability of prices was 
a necessary, if not always a sufficient, condition for durable 
growth. This stability particularly assumes the operation of an 
efficacious monetary policy clearly and explicitly oriented 
towards this objective," he added. 
  "It is credibility which now appears to be the key value, 
the 
condition for success (...). When there is total credibility in 
the Central Bank (...) market rates (...) can progressively 
eliminate (...) risk premiums (...). All countries are gradually 
reaching the same conclusions on the appropriateness of central 
bank independence," the prime minister concluded. 
  After its installation, the Monetary Policy Council, which 
consists of six members, in addition to the Governor of the Bank 
of France and his two vice-governors, held its first meeting, 
devoted to setting the length of each councillor's term. After 
drawing lots, the length of term for Jean Boissonnat and Bruno 
de Maulde was set at three years, that of Denise Flouzat and 
Jean-Pierre Gerard at six years, that of Michel Albert and 
Michel Sapin at nine years. These are not renewable except for 
the three-year terms.

  [Text] Toulouse, France, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The first A330 
Airbus to go into commercial service made its maiden flights on 
Monday [17 January] between Marseille and Paris, and then Paris 
and Toulouse, Air Inter airline officials said. 
  The airliner, flying for Air Inter, offers 412 seats, 30 
percent more than an Airbus A320, with the same fuel 
consumption. The airline officials said that the new model will 
offer productivity gains on the airline's most popular routes in 
France. 
  Air Inter is to receive three A330s by March, and a total of 
five by the end of the year, out of an initial order for 15 put 
in in 1989, at a time when air traffic was growing strongly. 
  The operating problems linked with the depressed conditions 
in the air travel industry have led Air Inter to adjust that 
initial order, so that it will be able to buy planes in the 
Airbus range from the A319 to the A330, depending on commercial 
needs.

  [Editorial Report] In an editorial in the 1-2 January 
left-of-center Paris daily LIBERATION, Gerard Dupuy examines the 
reasons that may have caused the government to release and 
extradite to Iran--rather than Switzerland, which had asked for 
them--the two suspects in the murder of Iranian dissident Kazem 
Rajavi. Perhaps it was in hopes of avoiding Iranian terrorist 
blackmail as the trial in France of former Iranian Prime 
Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar's assassin draws closer, Dupuy 
conjectures. Perhaps it was a way of ingratiating 
fundamentalists the world over, and especially in Algeria, he 
adds. Then again, the government may have been motivated by its 
desire to promote economic relations in an area where France's 
role is "unremarkable." Deploring the government's refusal to 
comment, Dupuy expresses the hope that, on the contrary, much 
will be said, it being "at least strange" that a government that 
includes "professional terrorist eaters" such as Interior 
Minister Charles Pasqua would show Tehran a kindness "whose 
laxism borders on cynicism." The "national interest" invoked by 
Paris entails a minimum of political morality, and hence 
transparency, Dupuy concludes.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] According to Philippe Reinhard's article 
in the 3 January Paris center-right daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's most delicate task for 1994 
will be dealing with Jacques Chirac, leader of Balladur's own 
party, the Rally for the Republic (RPR), in a probable race for 
the succession to President Francois Mitterrand in 1995. In the 
"inevitable" struggle that will ensue, Chirac enjoys two 
important advantages, says Reinhard. He can count on a devoted 
political apparatus and, unlike a Balladur busy with day-to-day 
problems and bound by his own promise to postpone the opening of 
the presidential debate, he enjoys greater freedom of movement. 
For his part, Balladur does not lack trump cards, Reinhard 
continues. The prime minister is already considered a candidate 
by a number of political personalities of the parliamentary 
majority and enjoys popular support, as indicated in a series of 
polls. However, the outcome of a race is undecided, Reinhard 
points out. Both men must take into account those who prefer to 
wait--like Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe--and those 
"lurking in the background," such as Union for French Democracy 
(UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who hopes that a 
Chirac-Balladur confrontation will open a "window of 
opportunity" for himself.

  [Editorial Report] Considering that the idea of abandoning 
the former Yugoslavia and removing UN forces stationed there is 
now openly debated, this first important test of a Europe on its 
way to unity is proof of "inconsistency," Gerard Dupuy 
editorializes in the 7 January left-of-center Paris daily 
LIBERATION. A "last and ironic example" of this is the appeal 
for help to President Clinton and the Americans by France, the 
European government most favorable to an active policy in the 
former Yugoslavia. This is a clever way to "pass the buck," 
Dupuy comments, since Paris is well aware that the Americans 
have no intention of picking it up, after their experience of 
"warring without making war" in Somalia quickly led them to 
"look for the exit." This is also why the only choice left for 
Europeans is to continue "the make-believe task of doing 
something" while letting their soldiers be ridiculed, perform 
"humanitarian" tasks that may well, in the end, turn against the 
civilian populations themselves, and wait for fires to die down 
while praying they do not start again in the neighbor's 
apartment," Dupuy concludes.

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The Organisation of the 
Islamic Conference (OIC) called Monday [17 January] for UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to authorise air strikes 
"without delay" against Bosnian Serb forces. 
  Foreign ministers from leading nations of the OIC met here 
with Butrus-Ghali to urge the UN to follow through on a pledge 
at the NATO summit to use air strikes if necessary to ensure the 
passage of aid and the safety of UN troops. 
  "We hope that this NATO declaration will not be construed as 
an empty threat and that it will not be the subject of 
procedural wrangling," said OIC Secretary General Hamid Algabid. 
  "We request that the UN secretary general authorise such 
strikes without delay," Algabid said after a meeting with the 
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
  Butrus-Ghali said through a spokeswoman that his meeting 
with 
the foreign ministers was "very positive" and that the ministers 
had "expressed their profound concern about the human tragedy" 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Algabid also urged the lifting of the arms embargo on the 
Moslem side to allow them a greater chance to defend themselves 
agains the better-armed Serbs and Croats. 
  The meeting of the OIC Bosnia group -- the foreign ministers 
of Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Senegal, Tunisia, Turkey and 
the deputy minister from Saudi Arabia -- comes a day before 
peace talks are due to resume here between the three sides 
involved in the Bosnia conflict. 
  But Algabid expressed the OIC's dismay about a plan on the 
table to divide Bosnia into three mini-states ruled by Serbs, 
Croats and Muslims. 
  "It is unacceptable to accommodate the expansionist 
territorial ambitions of Serb nationalism," he said. "The 
present approach in the negotiations would in fact amount to the 
virtual partitioning of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  The OIC was also to meet with EC and UN negotiators Lord 
Owen 
and Thorvald Stoltenberg to urge them to reconsider plans for a 
gradual lifting of sanctions against the rump-Yugoslavia. 
  Algabid also called on the UN to accept offers from the OIC 
to send troops to serve in the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR).

  [Text] The Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] has 
demanded immediate lifting of arms embargo against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The call was made in a joint declaration 
adopted at the end of a special ministerial meeting of the ICO 
contact group in Geneva. 
  Giving details of the declaration, Foreign Minister Sardar 
Asif Ahmad Ali said: 
  [Begin Asif Ali recording] The declaration stresses that the 
legitimacy and success of the peace process would be ensured 
only if it aims at preserving the independence, territorial 
integrity, sovereignty, and unity of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The declaration reiterates the well-known 
position of the Islamic countries that the arms embargo against 
Bosnia is contrary to Article 51 of the UN Charter and cannot be 
applied to that republic. The declaration also expresses concern 
over the increasingly volatile situation in (?Sanjak), Kosovo, 
and Vojvodina. It calls for the maintenance and strengthening 
of the sanctions against Serbia until a comprehensive and final 
settlement is achieved. 
  On the question of NATO air strikes against Serbian 
positions, the ministers urged that this decision be 
implemented, as already authorized by the Security Council. [end 
recording] 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ahmad Ali called on the Bosnian president, 
Alija Izetbegovic, and discussed with him the latest situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The foreign minister briefed the Bosnian 
president about the efforts being made by the ICO contact group 
for halting Serbian aggression against the Bosnian people. The 
foreign minister conveyed the good wishes of the president and 
prime minister of Pakistan to the Bosnian leader, who deeply 
appreciated the support extended to them by Pakistan. 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali also held talks with the Iranian 
foreign minister, Mr. Ali Akbar Velayati, on matters of common 
interest as well as bilateral relations. Both the foreign 
ministers exchanged views on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, and Afghanistan.

  [Text] Strasbourg, Jan 18 (AFP) -- The European Community 
can progress towards the introduction of a single currency 
without reimposing narrow bands on the exchange rate mechanism 
(ERM), Finance Commissioner Henning Christophersen said on 
Tuesday [18 January]. 
  "If everybody accepts that the 15 percent band is a normal 
band, the only important question is: Is your currency close to 
the central rate?," he told journalists outside a meeting of the 
European parliament. 
  At the beginning of August, in the face of massive 
speculation against currencies in the European monetary system 
(EMS) and particularly against the French franc, EC finance 
ministers widened the permitted range of fluctuation of most of 
the currencies within the ERM from 2.25 percent to 15 percent. 
  Christophersen said that the re-imposition of narrow bands 
might lead to a resumption of speculation against ERM currencies. 
  Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, the Community is 
to 
begin stage three of economic and monetary union between the end 
of 1997 and the end of 1999 at the latest. 
  Under stage three the Community is to adopt a single 
currency, and Christophersen declined to rule out the 
possibility that the currency might be adopted in 1997. 
However, he said that it would be "very, very difficult." 
  A senior EC official has said that six members of the 
Community might be ready quickly to meet the conditions for use 
of a single currency. He named them as Belgium, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Germany, Ireland and France.

<F P=106> [Report signed "d.h.": "Busek: Sympathy for NATO </F>
Partnership"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Austrian People's Party [OeVP] Chairman 
and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek on 17 January welcomed more 
clearly than last week the Partnership for Peace program offered 
by NATO. This means that he disagrees with Austrian Chancellor 
Franz Vranitzky, who in a DIE PRESSE interview rejected 
Austria's participation in such partnership. Commenting on the 
statements of the head of government and chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], Busek said: "This is not 
the government's opinion!" 
  The OeVP chairman said: "We welcome this initiative. 
Undoubtedly, there is no alternative to it." Busek said that 
all the other [heads of] neutral European states "except for 
Vranitzky" have welcomed the initiative. 
<H3>  Austrian Trade Union Federation Recommendation on the 
European Union </H3>
  Austrian Trade Union Federation [OeGB] President 
Verzetnitsch 
announced a separate OeGB recommendation for a referendum on 
European Union (EU) membership. This recommendation will be 
discussed at a conference at the end of the membership 
negotiations. 
  Representatives of the two government parties on 17 January 
demonstrated cautious optimism that the membership negotiations 
would be completed by March. SPOe floor leader Fuhrmann 
considers a date in March "not totally unrealistic." OeVP 
Secretary General Molterer believes the odds in favor are "more 
than 50 percent."

<F P=106> [Interview with FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider by Eva </F>
Grosskinsky, Heiner Emde, and Eugen Georg Schwarz; place and 
date not given: "Still Guest of the FDP Grass Roots"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] Your Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] is on 
bad terms with the Liberal International. The Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP] no longer appreciates you as a guest 
speaker. Do you now want to gain a foothold in Germany with the 
help of your friend Manfred Brunner? 
  [Haider] I was never popular as a guest speaker with the 
FDP. 
I am still popular with the grass roots. I will also participate 
in some events in the foreseeable future, in order to signal 
that the FDP leadership is ill advised and there is apparently 
no consensus with its grass roots. 
  [FOCUS] Do you believe Mr. Brunner's movement will be able 
to 
create such grass roots? 
  [Haider] First of all, it is important that his party 
exists. 
I also believe his chances in the European elections are not 
bad. And if it is desired, I will be absolutely prepared to 
support him. 
  [FOCUS] In what form? 
  [Haider] I do not yet have a clear idea. It will also depend 
on what he is really going to make of his group. It probably 
has to be seriously discussed to what extent his "citizens" 
movement is a party that can be regarded as a possible sister 
party. Of course, we do not have the intention -- as the FPOe 
or with Brunner's party -- to establish branches throughout 
Europe. It is my wish that Manfred Brunner will establish 
something like an independent Freedom Party of Germany. There 
is a voters' potential of at least 15 percent. In my opinion, 
Germany needs a liberal power, something like the FPOe in 
Austria. After all, the FDP has become a leftist party. And 
the Republikaner do not offer anything either. It is simply not 
enough to take the problem of "foreigners" and to say: "This is 
our issue." 
  [FOCUS] But you also have a preference for harping on it. 
  [Haider] Foreigners were the main issue in our petition for 
a 
referendum in 1993.... 
  [FOCUS] ....which did not meet with sufficient agreement. 
  [Haider] At any rate, it was one of the most successful 
petitions for a referendum in the Austrian Second Republic. And 
now the main issue is the reform of the state as whole, by which 
the political system is to be overcome. 
  [FOCUS] It is also one reason you are regarded as an 
extreme-right politician. How do you deal with this reproach? 
  [Haider] With my party, I am simply a special Austrian 
model. 
I protest against being compared with anyone. At any rate, we, 
the FPOe as a whole, are a compromise between a liberal and a 
national position. 
  [FOCUS] You want to establish a Third Republic in Austria. 
How do you envisage it? 
  [Haider] We need a new constitution, from which the systems 
of chambers and associations as a pillar of the constitution 
disappear.... 
  [FOCUS] ....and with what do you want to replace it? 
  [Haider] The citizen. 
  [FOCUS] This is too vague for us. Who is "the citizen?" 
  [Haider] Our political system in Austria does not know the 
citizen at all. We have a state of chambers, associations, and 
parties, and the citizen is, so to speak, the raw material that 
is supplied for the functioning of these chambers and 
associations. This involves a considerable loss of freedom. 
That is why we have the barbarism of the ideological terror of 
party politics and a mediatized freedom of the citizens. For 
example, these are two elements that are no longer supposed to 
exist in a Third Republic. 
  [FOCUS] Nevertheless, you are encouraging the following 
suspicion: "It is true that Haider is now saying that the 
citizen's will is decisive -- but what if he is in power?" Can 
you dispel the misgivings that your Third Republic will not be a 
parliamentary democracy? 
  [Haider] This argumentation is inappropriate. You invalidate 
the rules between government and opposition if you simply impute 
to the opposition the statement that "in reality you want 
something completely different!" It speaks in my favor that as 
governor of a province during a limited period I showed that we 
take promises seriously. In the two years in which I was 
responsible for affairs in Carinthia, an incredibly large number 
of reform steps were taken in this direction. 
  [FOCUS] What are the FPOe's conditions for Austria to join 
the European Union? 
  [Haider] The first point is adopting the transit treaty we 
have with the European Community. Second, we want to change 
over to extensive agriculture and support our farmers with 
direct payments. In this way, we can save a lot of money that 
is already spent today on marketing the surplus. Third, in the 
field of real estate transactions, we are thinking of the Danish 
model: five years of residence in Austria, then the opportunity 
to acquire land. 
  [FOCUS] Your phrases create the impression that you are the 
stronghold against the immigration of millions? 
  [Haider] We are not afraid of the immigration of Sicilians 
who want to open pizzerias everywhere here. The problem is the 
Eastern European region, the Asiatic region, and North Africa. 
We will be confronted with large migration movements from 
there. Today nobody says any longer: "We must have open 
borders!" We have reeducated the people in the government 
parties. 
  [FOCUS] You? Not inherent necessities? 
  [Haider] We reeducated them. 
  [FOCUS] The Germans, too? 
  [Haider] I am not responsible for Germany. I am responsible 
for Austria. 
  [FOCUS] The word "German" features largely in your 
vocabulary. Do you want to go "home into the Reich" with Austria? 
  [Haider] We as Austrians do not want the anschluss. We work 
hard enough ourselves, so we can be arrogant enough to say: We 
do not necessarily need you. You need us. The national complex 
in Germany and the Germans' self-hatred for their own people are 
so great that we do not particularly wish to participate in it. 
We prefer to go our own way.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Good Chances in Southeast Asia"] </F>
  [Text] There are good prospects for Austria's export trade 
to the Southeast Asian threshold countries. Transportation 
Minister Viktor Klima, who visited Vietnam, Malaysia, and 
Indonesia, accompanied by a delegation of leading industrialists 
and business managers, describes the region as a promising 
growth market with very tough competition. 
  In order for Austrian exporters to be successful on these 
markets, the state should grant them the same competitive 
conditions their foreign competitors enjoy, said Klima in a 
report on his talks. 
  Specific projects worth approximately 5 billion schillings 
were negotiated, Klima told Austrian radio correspondents 
following his visit. Klima is expecting the talks to yield 
tangible results within the next two or three years. 
  There is particularly great interest in equipment for local 
infrastructure programs, such as special rails, rail production 
machinery, locomotives, and freight cars. 
  In Vietnam, a bilateral railroad cooperation program is in 
the offing, and in Malaysia, a relevant railroad agreement, 
including the Austrian Rail Engineering (ARE) company, was 
discussed. In addition, Klima said deliveries in the area of 
power plant engineering and sewage treatment were discussed. 
However, real successes require soft loans. Klima said he 
would discuss this in the government. 
  Austrian suppliers will also set up, step-by-step, local 
production facilities in Indonesia and Malaysia. 
  In Kuala Lumpur, the extension of the current air transport 
agreement with Malaysia and MAS was discussed. Detailed 
negotiations are scheduled to begin in the next few weeks. The 
talks will be aimed at offering Vienna Airport increasingly as a 
bridgehead for Far East air connections. At present, MAS 
supplies a Kuala Lumpur-Vienna service twice every week.

<F P=106> [Report by W. Theuretsbacher, P. Grolig, and E. Bieber: </F>
"Witnesses: State Police Official Was Guest in Villa of 
Intelligence Chief Wolf"] 
  [Excerpt] "People will be surprised how many are involved 
in the affair," an insider hinted to KURIER, suggesting a 
widening of the affair surrounding the state police official 
Gustav Hochenbichler. A former agent for the East is still in 
office -- within the state police. "He is much more important, 
has good contacts, and knows a great deal about explosive state 
affairs," the insider claimed. 
  As reported yesterday, the 56-year-old police official, who 
is seriously ill, is suspected of having worked for an eastern 
intelligence service for many years. Two former Stasi members 
who were interrogated by the Vienna provincial court on 
Wednesday [12 January] claim that the senior police official was 
a former Stasi agent. 
  The two men think they remember that Hochenbichler was even 
received by East German intelligence chief Markus Wolf, 70, at 
his villa. 
  The police official was confronted on Friday by the two 
former agents who should recognize him in person, not only in 
photographs. The court has not disclosed any information about 
the result. 
  The suspect disappeared from public view after the court 
interrogation. It was not possible to contact him at home or 
with his relatives in Lower Austria. 
  The court believes that, as head of the Vienna state police 
office, Hochenbichler passed on former German Democratic 
Republic [GDR] refugee data. At the time, the Austrian state 
police questioned every East German refugee who was registered 
in Austria. Hochenbichler may also have been attractive for an 
eastern secret service because of his activities in embassies. 
The police official had numerous contacts with diplomats and 
often visited foreign missions. He was also responsible for 
ensuring the safety of official visitors to Vienna. 
  Former Stasi members mentioned a "dead letter box" through 
which the contact in Vienna allegedly passed on his information. 
This hiding place was reportedly located in a tube near 
Hochenbichler's home. When the investigators checked the place, 
they actually discovered a serviceable system of tubes that led 
into the basement. 
  Hochenbichler denies all accusations -- just as he did two 
years ago when allegations surfaced for the first time. Then, 
he assured his closest aides that these were all lies. As a 
result of the rumors, he was not promoted to head the Vienna 
state police when that spot became vacant. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Michael Voelker: "`NS' Letter Deplores </F>
`Genocide'"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- A "Self-Defense Community of Police 
Officers" [Notwehrgemeinschaft der Sicherheitswachebeamten], 
which uses the initials "NS" is causing a stir among the Vienna 
police. In a "Dear Colleagues" letter, the "infiltration of our 
state leadership by Jewish circles" is deplored. 
  The letter, seen at nearly all Vienna police stations and 
also found at external units, including the Security Alert 
Department, lists eight persons -- partly indicating their 
addresses -- who participated in talks on amending the 
"Stalinist" law banning neo-Nazi activities. 
  The names include Simon Wiesenthal, "correct name: Szymon 
Wizenthal, reparation fraud," and the lawyers Gabriel Lansky and 
Georg Zanger, both described as "Jews, communists, freemasons, 
members of the Udo Proksch gang [Vienna businessman who was 
sentenced for causing the death of six persons], probably KGB 
and Mosad agents." Zanger has now brought charges against 
unknown perpetrators, and he wants to support the proceedings as 
a private person. 
  According to the Self-Defense Community, the Austrian 
Government consists "only of freemasons and partly of Jews or of 
persons with Jewish ancestry (Education Minister Scholten, Vice 
Chancellor Erhard Busek, Social Affairs Minister Hesoun, 
Transportation Minister Klima, Finance Minister Lacina)." 
Austria's "official immigration policy" leads to the 
"destruction of the racial nature of the people through the 
replacement of natives by foreigners, and through the settlement 
of members of other races." Thus, the government is "guilty of 
genocide." The "admission of foreigners and the destruction of 
closed settlement areas of native (German) population" is "high 
treason." 
  The letter refers to, among other things, the "Illustrated 
Review of the Austrian Federal Police" and a "secret file of the 
Vienna Police" and also deplores the fate of Gottfried Kuessel 
and Guenter Reinthaler. 
  A "statement" that ends with "yours sincerely, your 
Self-Defense Community of Police Officers (NS)," announces that 
the politicians will no longer be protected. "Our professional 
honor and conviction as representatives of law and order -- and 
not of `legal injustice' -- commands us to serve the people." 
Thus, the "NS" considers itself "unable to guarantee the 
security of politicians responsible for the replacement of 
natives because they have lost their right to protection through 
their criminal actions."

<F P=106> [Severin Carrell report: "Reports of UN Venue for Bomb Trial </F>
Denied] 
  [Text] The Foreign Office yesterday strenuously denied 
reports that it had approved a proposal to try the two Libyans 
accused of the Lockerbie bombing at a United Nations court in 
the Netherlands. 
  A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said 
last 
night the Government was determined that their trial should take 
place either in Scotland or in the United States. 
  It emerged yesterday that a proposal has been developed by 
an 
independent intermediary, suggesting that the trial could be 
held at the UN International Court of Justice at The Hague. 
  It would be held under Scottish law and rules of evidence 
with a Scottish judge presiding over an international panel of 
judges sitting without a jury. The plan is the latest in a 
string of compromises put forward with the approval of the 
Libyans' lawyers. 
  It is to be put formally to Lord Rodger, the Lord Advocate, 
this week. It will also be raised with Douglas Hurd, the 
Foreign Secretary, by the Tory MP, Teddy Taylor, who recently 
visited Libya to investigate their complaints about the 
Lockerbie case. 
  'Abd-al-Basit 'Ali Muhammad al-Meqrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah 
Fahimah were accused by both the UK and US in late 1991 of 
planting the bomb, killing 259 passengers and crew onboard PanAm 
Flight 103 and 11 Lockerbie inhabitants on 21 December 1988. 
  The Government has been informally aware of the plan, 
disclosed yesterday in Scoland on Sunday, but has refused to 
endorse it. 
  The FCO spokesman said: "Our position remains the same. We 
expect the two suspects to be surrendered for trial in either 
Scotland or the United States. This is a UN Security Council 
requirement." 
  The proposal, which has been provisionally accepted by the 
Libyan accused, is to be discussed in detail by their legal team 
in Geneva this week. Alistair Duff, the Edinburgh-based 
solicitor-advocate acting for them in Scotland, is expected to 
fly out tomorrow. It was designed to overcome Libyan claims 
that pre-trial publicity has destroyed the chances of a fair 
jury trial in either Scotland or the US, and the Government's 
refusal to countenance Libyan schemes for a trial in a neutral 
country. 
  A Scottish Office spokesman said it would not comment until 
it had seen the proposal. But it is understood the Government 
believes it is unworkable as there are no legal mechanisms which 
allow a Scottish judge to sit abroad, or for Scottish law to be 
transferred abroad. 
  The proposal's supporters claim the Government could make it 
possible if it had the will. Mr Taylor, MP for Southend, 
believes the scheme has merits. "There are procedural problems, 
but these could be worked out in 10 minutes by the House of 
Commons." 
  It is understood it is a refinement of a scheme first 
outlined in a letter sent by the Egyptian government to every 
member of the UN Security Council, including the UK and USA 
governments, five weeks ago. The UN secretary general, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, also received a copy. 
  Mr Taylor said the Egyptians had, in consultation with 
Libya, 
proposed on 8 December to Britain holding the trial under 
Scottish law in a neutral country, or at the UN International 
Court. No reply has yet been received, he claimed.

<F P=106> [Philip Johnston report: "Sinn Fein Claims Peace Talks Began </F>
Three Years Ago"] 
  [Text] Contacts between the Government and the political 
leadership of the IRA began two and a half years earlier than 
ministers have acknowledged, it was claimed by Sinn Fein 
yesterday. 
  Mr Tom Hartley, national chairman of Sinn Fein, told a news 
conference at Westminster that links began in October 1990 with 
a meeting between Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein deputy 
president, and an unnamed representative from the Government 
  The press conference, sponsored by Left-wing Labour MPs Mr 
Tony Benn and Mr Jeremy Corbyn, was condemned by Tory MPs as an 
"abuse of privilege" and a "publicity stunt". 
  The decision to publish Sinn Fein's version of the contacts 
and to lodge them in the Commons library did little to dispel 
the view that the "peace process" launched at Downing Street 
last month had become bogged down. 
  The language used by Mr Hartley, who accused ministers of 
"Iying" and issuing "bogus" accounts of the communications, 
confirmed there had been no progress in the intervening four 
weeks. 
  Sinn Fein has written to Mr Major asking for clarification 
of 
the Downing Street declaration, something the Prime Minister 
resolutely refuses to provide. 
  Mr Hartley said a decision by the IRA on whether to continue 
with the process would not be made until there had been a 
response from the Government though the absence of clarification 
would not necessarily end the initiative. 
  The documents, many of which have been seen before were 
published by Sinn Fein to back up its claim that it was 
justified in asking for clarification. "Throughout this record 
of exchanges, there are examples of clarification sought by Sinn 
Fein and given by the British Government," said Mr Hartley. "All 
this begs the question about the seriousness of the Government's 
approach to a peaceful settlement in Ireland." 
  A line of communication has existed between Sinn Fein and 
the 
Government for more than 20 years and was used at the time of 
the Maze prison hunger strikes in 1981. 
  According to the documents published in November by Sir 
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, the channel was 
reopened last February after a message from Mr McGuinness 
stating that "the conflict is over". 
  Sinn Fein denies this message was ever sent and traces the 
communications to October 1990, followed by 18 messages between 
then and February 1993, when the contacts started in earnest. 
  They included advance notification to Sinn Fein of speeches 
to be made by ministers and a position paper setting out the 
progress of inter-party talks then going on in Northern Ireland. 
  Which side instigated last year's contacts continues to be 
disputed, but it is clear that events moved swiftly from last 
February, with discussions even at this stage about the 
withdrawal of troops to barracks and the removal of checkpoints. 
  A report of a meeting on Feb 24 last year--which was not 
included in the British record of contacts--said: "The IRA needs 
to provide the space to turn the possibility of meetings into a 
reality. A suspension is all that is being required of them. The 
British believed that two or three weeks was a sufficient period 
to convince republicans." 
  A later document claims that Britain was suggesting venues 
for talks, including Scotland, the Isle of Man, Denmark and 
Norway. 
  Sinn Fein also denies having sent a message to the 
Government 
on Nov 2 last year which prompted a definitive policy statement 
three days later. Four documents were withheld by Sinn Fein on 
grounds of "sensitivity". Mr Hartley said they "have a relevance 
to the on-going efforts to build on the process." 
  Lady Olga Maitland, Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam who 
attended 
the press conference accused Sinn Fein of "cynical hypocrisy". 
  Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann said 
there was nothing new in the documents."That makes it absolutely 
outrageous that Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn should abuse their 
privileges as MPs to give a platform to a squalid terrorist 
gang," he said on BBC radio. 
  "I believe that they have taken the decision to reject the 
declaration."

<F P=106> [Sean O'Neill report: "Major Denies Any Role in Arms Deal"] </F>
  [Text] Mr Major became the first serving Prime Minister to 
be called to a judicial inquiry yesterday when he appeared 
before Lord Justice Scott and sought to distance himself from 
the arms-to-Iraq affair. 
  During six hours of questioning Mr Major, who became Foreign 
Secretary in July 1989, then Chancellor before succeeding Lady 
Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1990, denied any role in for 
formulating, considering amending or interpreting policy on 
defence exports to Iraq. 
  He said he had not been told of an alleged relaxation of 
guidelines on military exports to Iraq until November 1992 after 
the collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial. He still did not 
accept that any relaxation had been put into practice. 
  Mr Major said he had not been involved in the decision in 
1990--by which time he was Chancellor--to investigate and later 
prosecute three Matrix Churchill executives. That was a matter 
for Customs, not ministers, he added. 
  He said he had not been briefed about the operation of the 
guidelines on exports to Iraq and Iran when he became Foreign 
Secretary in July 1989. During his three months at the Foreign 
Office the issue had arisen only once, when the Cabinet rejected 
British Aerospace's plans to sell the Hawk trainer aircraft to 
Iraq. 
  Asked if he knew that following the Iranian fatwa on Salman 
Rushdie, civil servants operated stricter export rules for Iran 
than for Iraq, Mr Major said: "Neither at that stage nor later 
was I involved in formulation of the guidelines, consideration 
of the guidelines, amendment of the guidelines nor 
interpretation of the guidelines." 
  When Miss Presiley Baxendale, QC [Queen's Counsel], counsel 
to the inquiry, returned to the issue, Mr Major replied: "We 
have been dancing around this point for some time. You're asking 
me to make a judgment at a distance and not a judgment at the 
time. 
  "With great respect I don't think that is a judgment I 
should 
make. I think that is a judgment for the inquiry." 
  Lord Justice Scott told Mr Major that the inquiry knew that 
the rules on exports to Iraq had been relaxed. 
  Mr Major said: "Well, I don't know that and I didn't know 
that." He had not known of any discussion on changing the 
guidelines until he had been at No 10 for two years. "The first 
time I was aware they had been looked at and a change considered 
was on Nov 13, 1992, when I received a memo from my private 
secretary to that effect. " 
  Then, amid the flurry of political and media inquiries 
following the collapse of the Matrix Churchill case, he had 
ordered "a massive search of files" to establish what he had 
been told. 
  "One of the charges at the time was that, because I had been 
Chancellor, because I had been Foreign Secretary, because I was 
Prime Minister, I must have known what was going on in the 
undergrowth." 
  A memo from Mr Stephen Wall, then his private secretary, 
mentioned a meeting between three junior ministers--Mr Alan 
Clark, Mr William Waldegrave and Lord Trefgarne--in December 
1988 at which the wording of the guidelines was revised. 
  Mr Major marked the passage in the memo with a cross. "It's 
my cross on the paper because that is the first time I knew of 
it." 
  Days later further research by Mr Nicholas Bevan, then a 
senior Foreign Office official suggested the revised version of 
the guidelines had not been put into practice. 
  Senior ministers were uncertain about how to respond to the 
barrage of parliamentary questions facing them. Having by now 
announced the Scott Inquiry they decided against further 
statements to Parliament. 
  Mr Major said: "There was a great deal of uncertainty over 
what had happened over the 1988 wording. Had it been implemented 
or had it not? I couldn't know which was right. It is very 
dangerous to respond to Parliament when there is a doubt." 
  As Chancellor from 1989-90 papers relating to a 
Cabinet-level 
meeting on the future of trade with Iraq were circulated to his 
private office. The meeting, chaired by Mr Hurd in July 1990 
weeks before the invasion of Kuwait, decided to relax controls 
on defence exports to Iraq. Mr Major said he did not see the 
papers nor attend the meeting. They were passed to a junior 
minister. 
  As Prime Minister, issues concerning the Matrix Churchill 
prosecution were raised with him. Whitehall was concerned about 
the possibility of ministers setting a precedent by appearing as 
witnesses. The usual practice was for civil servants to 
represent them. 
  Mr Major said he sought the Attorney-General's advice and 
was 
told that Mr Clark and Lord Trefgarne should appear at the trial 
if called. 
  The use of public interest immunity certificates in the case 
was the first time he had come across them in practice, said Mr 
Major. He had not inquired about the contents of the documents 
they covered and was not involved in the decision to sign them. 
  Later he and Mr Hurd agreed that if the certificates were 
overturned and sensitive documents were released to the defence, 
it would not be right for the Government to try to stop the 
trial. 
  The inquiry was adjourned until later this week.

<F P=106> [Sonia Purnell report: "Major Backed 234 Million Pound </F>
Error"] 
  [Text] Mr Major gave his personal backing to a 
controversial aid project in Malaysia which has been condemned 
as a waste of 234 million pounds of taxpayers' money, MPs were 
told yesterday. 
  Sir Timothy Lankester, permanent secretary of the Overseas 
Development Agency [ODA], told the Commons Public Accounts 
Committee that not only had Mr Hurd, Foreign Secretary, taken 
the unusual step of overruling his rejection of the Pergau power 
scheme, but he had done so in consultation with the Prime 
Minister. 
  Both men were involved in the decision to proceed with an 
informal offer of assistance made to the Malaysian government by 
Lady Thatcher, when she was Prime Minister in 1989. 
  The money has gone towards the 417 million pounds cost of a 
hydro-electric power project, being built by a consortium 
including British construction firms Balfour Beatty and 
Trafalgar House. 
  Yet Sir Timothy, responsible for vetting overseas aid, had 
repeatedly warned ministers that Pergau was uneconomic and a 
waste of the limited overseas aid budget. 
  He made his views clear right up until February 1991 when 
the 
final decision to proceed was taken, he said. He sent two 
memoranda to ministers arguing against the project, although he 
has been barred from providing MPs with copies of the notes. 
  Despite the size of the project, which has increased in cost 
by a third since 1989, ODA officials began a formal on-site 
economic appraisal of Pergau only one day before Lady Thatcher 
met the Malaysian prime minister and offered assistance. "there 
was great concern at the time (about this). It was 
well-recognised that a more substantial appraisal was deserved 
before an offer of aid. 
  "But there was resistance to an appraisal from the 
consortium 
itself, the DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] and the High 
Commission in Kuala Lumpur because they thought it would disturb 
the negotiations," Sir Timothy said. 
  He also took the opportunity to read out a new statement on 
the affair from Mr Hurd, whose role has already been criticised 
by the National Audit Office. 
  Praising the conduct of his permanent secretary, the Foreign 
Secretary said he had taken his decision "from a wider 
perspective" and that it was the "right decision for British 
interests". 
  He added: "We needed to take account, not only of the 
commitment made at the highest level, but also to the 
consequences for the United Kingdom if we failed to honour that 
commitment. 
  "Ministers decided that the Government, despite the increase 
in price, were bound by the undertaking given earlier." 
  Mr Hurd pointed out that British sales to Malaysia rose from 
226 million pounds in 1986 to 635 million pounds in 1992. At one 
time, Malaysia had conducted a "Buy British Last" campaign, Sir 
Timothy added. 
  Labour MPs sought to establish links between the aid offer 
and a simultaneous 1 billion [U.S. trillion] pound defence 
contract awarded by Malaysia. It is illegal for ministers to use 
aid as a means of securing defence sales but Sir Timothy would 
not be drawn on the allegations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/CSU </F>
Bundestag group, by Dieter Schroeder and Stefan Kornelius; place 
and date not given: "`It Would Be Mistake To Do Without Kohl's 
Leadership Power'"] 
  [Text] Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag 
group, opened the new year with warnings: In the Bundestag 
group and in other bodies of the party, he repeatedly pointed to 
surveys that showed disastrous results for the CDU. The party 
was giving the outward impression of lacking solidarity, and it 
appears to be lacking initiative and optimism at the beginning 
of a series of elections. Schaeuble urged for a rapid change. 
Instead of internal disputes, the CDU should concentrate on the 
opposition and reemphasize its authority in the spheres of 
economic and labor policy, internal and external security, and 
the family. Dieter Schroeder and Stefan Kornelius conducted the 
following interview with Schaeuble: 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] At the weekend, the CDU Federal 
Executive Committee will hold a meeting behind closed doors to 
discuss election strategies, among other issues. Do you have an 
idea of how to lead the CDU out of its current low? 
  [Schaeuble] In this super election year, the CDU is facing 
the question of what strategy to meet the challenges. In the 
meeting, the CDU will, of course, also nominate its candidate to 
succeed Richard von Weizsaecker. As far as the political 
situation is concerned, one must not forget that the government 
and the coalition have made enormous achievements following the 
profound changes in Germany and Europe. Yet, these changes have 
also created insecurity, and those who bear political 
responsibility must now concentrate on those political spheres 
of action that are really of priority in order to eliminate any 
unclear points in the public debate and the apparent or actual 
controversies within our own camp. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] How would you describe these spheres 
of action? 
  [Schaeuble] We must effectively strengthen economic growth 
and create more jobs; we must take care of external security. 
The people clearly feel dangers that are emanating from Bosnia 
to Russia. They feel that peace has not been absolutely ensured 
for either the present or the future. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Would you like to endorse yourself as 
the party that is taking care of Germany's security? 
  [Schaeuble] We will definitely increasingly emphasize our 
responsibility regarding foreign and security policy. After 
all, that is also the decisive reason that, despite certain 
understandable criticism of many details of European 
developments, we quite rightly maintain the conviction that the 
path toward integration in the European Union and the Atlantic 
Alliance must remain irreversible, for, in the center of Europe, 
it will only be through stronger integration that the united 
Germany will be able to gain a safe future in peace and freedom. 
The sphere of internal security is of equal importance. The 
fourth area, the family, that is to say the voluntary solidarity 
between the generations, is also a central issue for the 
stability of our liberal and social system. 
  We will not only be judged by the diversity of the proposals 
and concepts, but the people expect decisions and action from 
us. This is why a controversy or the appearance of controversy 
within the coalition is a particular nuisance, which, if in 
doubt, will be to the disadvantage of all coalition partners, 
but most certainly to the disadvantage of the senior partner. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you referring to the controversy 
with the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] over the bugging 
of suspected criminals' private homes? 
  [Schaeuble] With the 1994 anticrime law, which the 
government 
and the coalition are now bringing along, we agreed with the FDP 
on a whole series of measures -- agreement that was considered 
impossible in the coalition only a year ago. There is growing 
understanding that freedom at home might crumble. What is true 
is that we do remain at odds on one issue, and that is the issue 
of the electronic monitoring of private homes. We regard this 
as imperative, while our FDP colleagues -- they are bound by an 
opposing party congress resolution -- are not yet prepared to 
change their position. Nevertheless, I am very optimistic that, 
in the medium-term, the FDP will change its position, because it 
must. Just think of the long debate on the asylum law, where we 
can see today that we were right to insist on our position. 
Nevertheless, as long as there is no agreement, there is a 
danger that disagreement on one point, one that is actually not 
crucial, forces everything else into the background. After all, 
disagreement makes better news and as long as we are in the 
law-making process, the things that are changing are incredibly 
difficult to get across to others. Let us take the debate on 
the amendment of the asylum law: Until last summer this was an 
issue where one side said that it meant the end of freedom. The 
others said that such an amendment would not change anything. 
Half a year later, and after it was implemented, one can see 
that, first, a sufficient number of persecuted and suffering 
persons still find shelter in Germany. One cannot say that the 
doors have been closed. On the other hand, the amendment did 
have its effect, with numbers clearly dropping, and procedures 
having been speeded up. The most important effect was that the 
relationship between German and foreign citizens has once again 
become more relaxed and less strained. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The CSU seems to be thinking 
differently and intends to bring up the issue again. 
  [Schaeuble] If you will permit me to say so, I understood 
the 
CSU differently. I think that there are many persons in the CSU 
who say -- which is undeniable -- that the new asylum law 
regulation has produced a significant decrease in the number of 
asylum-seekers, faster procedures, and more cases of 
deportation. Thus, it has been useful. Of course, one cannot 
say now that the problem has been completely solved. After all, 
there can be developments outside our borders that might once 
again lead to dramatic developments. Therefore, the continued 
concern for the stability of our liberal law-governed state, the 
citizens' trust in the ability of the state to protect them 
remains an important issue also for the elections, whether in 
the campaign to the Bavarian Landtag, the European election, or 
the Bundestag election -- there is no difference between the CDU 
and CSU here. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Does this not mean that you are 
fanning fears? 
  [Schaeuble] No. The question of how we deal with the fact 
that there is such a huge -- economical, political, and social 
-- gap in Europe today, which might escalate to violence and 
enormous conflicts in no time, has to be foremost in our 
thoughts. This issue is not only part of the public discussion 
in Germany because it does worry people. I have said that the 
way in which the world is developing, the borders between 
internal and external security will get increasingly blurred. 
One has to take these concerns seriously. However, these 
concerns also include our ambition to maintain and improve 
peaceful, relaxed, and friendly coexistence between Germans and 
foreign fellow citizens in Germany. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] By constantly referring to internal 
security, one gets the impression that, despite the failed first 
attempt, you intend to stick to the issue of using the 
Bundeswehr for tasks at home. 
  [Schaeuble] I predict that the issue will remain high on the 
agenda until it is solved in the way I proposed. It will take 
some time, because it requires a Basic Law amendment, which, due 
to the refusal of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], 
cannot be achieved overnight. However, this does not change the 
fact that the issue has to be discussed. What is it all about? 
Well, the point is not to create new tasks for the Bundeswehr. 
Actually, the expression: Bundeswehr missions at home is also 
quite misleading. The real point is that situations may occur in 
which the federal and laender police forces reach the limits of 
their capacity. There is a simple example these days, which did 
not upset anybody and nobody even compared it with Franco's 
Spain: As the floodwaters were rising dangerously, our 
neighbor, Holland, used military forces to close parts of cities 
and to protect them against looters. I gave a different example 
from my prior personal experience: During preparations for the 
1985 world economic summit, for which I was responsible in my 
capacity as head of the Chancellor's Office, I had to deal with 
the question of how we could defend ourselves against a 
terrorist attack from the air. Such a threat existed at the 
time, and only the Bundeswehr could have offered such 
protection. However, our Basic Law ruled out such a mission. I 
saw that as an absolutely absurd situation. Besides, what do 
you mean when you say that my first attempt failed? The first 
opinion poll with which I am familiar proves that, although the 
published opinion is widely negative, my view is supported by a 
majority of those asked. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, you cannot even count on 
support from your own party! 
  [Schaeuble] Yes, I can; I do now know of any dissenting 
opinion from within my party, apart from a statement by Volker 
Ruehe, who said the Bundeswehr does not need any new tasks. He 
does not need any new tasks for the Bundeswehr -- that is 
absolutely true. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Do you have the feeling that the SPD 
is beginning to get dangerous for you? 
  [Schaeuble] It is true that Mr. Scharping and the SPD are 
pursuing quite a clever strategy or tactics. However, they are 
not solving a single problem. The issue of Bundeswehr missions 
within the framework of the United Nations has not been solved; 
on the contrary, the SPD is obstructing it. The issue of 
nursing care insurance remains unsolved for the same reasons. 
Internal security is not solved, either. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, your problems with the FDP are 
even greater. 
  [Schaeuble] No, only the SPD is obstructing these issues. 
Regarding the use of electronic listening devices, there has 
been no SPD initiative, neither in the Bundestag nor in the 
Bundesrat. Mr. Scharping's tactic is to keep a very low profile 
for the SPD -- basically to refuse confrontation or debate 
alternatives, and, instead, say that insecurity and ill feelings 
really do exist, and there is a lot of criticism of necessary 
austerity measures, and that the government alone is to be 
blamed for everything. Therefore, I say that in the upcoming 
debates we must more clearly work out the opposition's 
alternatives or force them to present their alternatives, or say 
that they do not have any. It is true that the current 
situation is too comfortable for the SPD. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, you will hardly be able to 
reduce unemployment before election day, and you still have to 
agree on considerable cuts to finance it. 
  [Schaeuble] What is correct is that we will not be able to 
do without cuts. What is also true is that, to achieve 
sustained strengthening of the forces for economic recovery, we 
have to examine certain well-acquired rights -- such as in the 
sphere of deregulation, for example whether we extend the 
employment promotion law with the possibility of restricted 
protection against dismissal for the initial phase of 
employment, or whether we should authorize private labor 
exchanges. 
  What is also true is that the difficult situation on the 
labor market cannot be dramatically changed for the better in 
the short term. The people have to be told so with great 
frankness. I think what is also true, however, is that most 
people basically know and understand that and are ready to put 
up with the necessary changes. Looking at the wage agreement in 
the chemical industry, I have to say with respect that his wide 
public debate on what is possible and necessary has not remained 
without an effect. This has made me optimistic also regarding 
the upcoming elections. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Nevertheless, you will have to cope 
with the problem of the lacking social balance of the austerity 
measures. 
  [Schaeuble] I'll tell you something: The social democrats 
and socialists of all shades have always known how to make envy 
the driving force of their policy. It is true that envy is a 
strong human motivation. On the other hand, sheer reason is not 
so hopelessly inferior either, because, otherwise, one would 
have to become pessimistic regarding the prospects for the 
development of man and society.... Therefore, I say that any 
person who has a basic knowledge of economics knows that, 
considering the current difficult economic situation and in 
addition to the significant increase in taxes and rates that 
came into force on 1 January, we were unable to introduce 
further massive tax increases in 1994 unless we incurred further 
dangers for economic development and, consequently, for jobs. 
  Since this is the case, we have said that we would not be 
able to reintroduce the solidarity tax before 1995. We have to 
reintroduce it because, after 40 years of socialism and German 
division, the financial burden cannot be funded otherwise. As 
for the struggle between economic reason -- as represented by 
the CDU -- and the socialist feeling of envy, I am optimistic 
that we will be the winner. I do admit that we have not yet won 
it. After all, the election year has only just begun. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Regardless of any confrontation 
strategy, does your party not first have to regain lost 
authority in this sphere? 
  [Schaeuble] We must quickly make clear how, in the long 
term, we will achieve more growth and more jobs. This cannot 
always be attained by increasing taxes and rates but only by 
cutting public spending. At almost 52 percent, the state and 
tax rate is now almost as high as in the early 80's when Helmut 
Kohl first became chancellor. We brought it down to 46 percent 
in the 80's, which was an enormous success and the real reason 
for sustained economic upswing and stability in that decade. As 
a result of German unity, we have now fallen back to the level 
of the early 80's. By the end of the decade we have to reduce 
it again. This is possible through tough decisions and 
disputes. If we manage to achieve it, we will have more growth, 
more jobs, and more social security in the long run. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Why is family policy such a priority 
for you? 
  [Schaeuble] It is a question not only of money but also of 
priorities. In connection with Basic Law amendments, some 
people have requested that all possible forms of human 
coexistence -- which I do not want to valuate -- be regarded as 
equal with marriage and family, which boils down to a 
devaluation of the institutionalized precedence given to 
marriage and family. The decisive question is: What about the 
solidarity between the generations? How can we preserve social 
stability in the long term when an ever-shrinking number of 
people have to bear responsibility for new generations? In human 
history, or what we know of it, no better community of 
solidarity than the family has been found yet. The family has 
been greatly debilitated and must now be strengthened again. 
One element for it is the nursing care insurance. This is why 
we will not give up our struggle to overcome the SPD's 
obstructionist position. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has the nursing care insurance still 
a chance in this legislative term? 
  [Schaeuble] I hope so, because everything else would be 
irresponsible. What the SPD majority is doing in the Bundesrat 
is an abuse of constitutional policy. Therefore, we will not 
give up. In the talks between party and Bundestag group chairmen 
in the Chancellor's Office, we basically reached complete 
agreement. Since, in connection with the law on continued 
remuneration, which does not require the SPD's support, the SPD 
wants to achieve something that cannot be achieved without a 
majority in the Bundestag, it is now trying to press for changes 
of the law on continued remuneration by refusing to support the 
nursing care insurance in the Bundesrat. This is an abuse of 
constitutional policy. We will not tolerate that. I do not 
think that, in the long term, the SPD will be able to thwart the 
agreement on nursing care insurance because of that. Therefore, 
the issue is neither dead nor over. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has this government not become 
tired after so many years in power, is it not a "lame duck" nine 
months before the election? 
  [Schaeuble] No, even though the SPD will try to take 
advantage of such feelings -- such an election campaign is also 
an exciting competition, after all -- and say: "oh well, he has 
been federal chancellor for so long, he is a great man with 
great historical merit, he is the chancellor of German unity, 
and he has done more for European unification than any other 
person since Konrad Adenauer, but at the end of 1994 he will 
have been in office for 12 years." My simple response will be: 
When there are so many changes; when there is so much 
insecurity; when the risks in terms of foreign policy have 
become greater, less predictable, and more difficult to 
calculate than they may have been in the past, it is an immense 
resource and an enormous advantage for Germany to have a federal 
chancellor with such an unparalleled degree of experience and 
international reputation and influence. Just take the GATT 
negotiations. The only one who was able to dissolve the dispute 
between the Americans and French was Helmut Kohl. He could do 
it. That the NATO summit concluded with the result that NATO 
once again assumed responsibility for the eastern European 
reform states has a lot to do with Helmut Kohl. Therefore, I am 
saying that Helmut Kohl must remain federal chancellor after 
this year, too. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, this feeling is not shared by 
everybody in your own party.... 
  [Schaeuble] ... not yet! 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] ... but people seem to get a certain 
pleasure from talking about repeatedly spreading rumors of a 
coup.... 
  [Schaeuble] ... no. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Yes, even you are familiar with this 
scenario: After a defeat in the Lower Saxon election in March, 
the question of whether we can still win the Bundestag election 
with Helmut Kohl will be raised. Would we not have to replace 
him, would we not have to present a new candidate? Then there 
would be only one, namely Wolfgang Schaeuble. 
  [Schaeuble] No, such scenarios do not exist in the CDU -- or 
at least I am not familiar with them. Moreover, I would tell 
anybody wanting to conduct such a discussion with me what I have 
just told you, namely that we would be making a terrible mistake 
to do without the power to assert authority, the leadership 
power, the confidence, that Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
displays at home and abroad. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You have always acted like somebody 
who called for unity within the CDU/CSU. Does that mean that 
you want to bury the domestic-policy controversy over the way in 
which Roman Herzog was suddenly nominated by the CSU in Kreuth? 
  [Schaeuble] I have said in the Bundestag that it is actually 
somewhat regrettable that in a question over which there is 
actually no controversy -- after all, we are in full agreement 
that Roman Herzog is to be the CDU/CSU's candidate for federal 
president -- for a few days we did give the impression that we 
were of a differing opinion here. I have, therefore, appealed 
to everyone to frustrate such an impression. It is good that 
this controversy will not continue. We must now, for God's 
sake, frustrate the impression that we are of a differing 
opinion on this issue, when, in reality, we are not. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Will there be any further attempts to 
win the FDP's support for a joint candidate, or is that 
impossible? 
  [Schaeuble] I think that we should not continue this 
discussion. The FDP has dutifully proposed Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher and made the necessary declarations. I think that 
in the Federal Assembly we will see the election of the CDU/CSU 
candidate. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you not bound to face permanent 
controversy with the CSU in the next few months? The CSU is 
fighting for survival, you are fighting for your survival, and 
the CSU is constantly trying to acquire a strong image. The 
issue of "grand coalition" also created controversy in Kreuth. 
If the CDU were to agree on such a coalition, the CSU plans to 
disassociate itself from the CDU. 
  [Schaeuble] One cannot speak of disassociation; after all, 
from whom did Theo Waigel disassociate himself? We are in 
absolute agreement, and we have talked about it this morning 
(Wednesday) at the level of party and Bundestag group chairmen 
of the coalition that we are not seeking a grand coalition but 
will do everything to achieve a majority in order to continue 
the coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP. There is no 
difference of opinion between Theo Waigel, Helmut Kohl, and 
Wolfgang Schaeuble. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But there is a difference between 
what you are trying to achieve and the current speculation in 
case one has no other choice. Even you have not completely 
ruled out a grand coalition, because you cannot, really. It 
will all depend on the election result, over which we have no 
influence. 
  [Schaeuble] We do have a certain influence. Nevertheless, 
it would be stupid to indulge in too much speculation. As a 
politician with a certain assignment to lead and to bear 
responsibility, I have to say what I want, what I am aiming at, 
and what I am struggling for. Of course, as a democrat I have 
to respect any election result. Still, as long as the polling 
stations are not yet closed and have not even opened, for that 
matter, I do not have to indulge in any speculation as to what 
might be, but I have to concentrate on what I can offer the 
voters. And this is what we are concentrating on; then the 
voters will decide, and those who get elected have the duty to 
respect the election result and draw their conclusions. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, you would be a bad politician 
if you did not also include the possibility of a grand coalition 
in your calculations. 
  [Schaeuble] I would be a fool or idiot if I were to indulge 
in such public speculation.
