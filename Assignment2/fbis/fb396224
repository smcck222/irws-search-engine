<F P=106> [Article by Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho: "Union, But on </F>
Finnish Terms"] 
  [Text] The question most frequently put to me these days, 
both at home and abroad, is: Will Finland become a member of 
the European Union [EU] on 1 January 1995 or not? Before 
dwelling on the intricacies of the negotiations going on in 
Brussels, I would first like to tell you a story about our most 
famous Finnish composer, Jean Sibelius. 
  In his younger days, Sibelius used to spend a lot of time in 
Helsinki restaurants. When one particular spree had lasted 
several days, his wife finally telephoned her husband to ask for 
a tentative forecast of when he was likely to come home. 
  "My dear," Sibelius sighed, "I am a composer. My vocation is 
to compose, not to make forecasts." 
  In a similar vein, I would prefer to refrain from detailed 
forecasts at this critical and delicate juncture in Finland's 
negotiations over European Union accession. However, I am more 
than keen to explain the background to our membership initiative 
and the high stakes involved in the process under way. 
  Finland has always been a thoroughly European nation. 
Western and Eastern influences have met on our Nordic soil, 
moulding our culture and lifestyle. Much of our heritage and 
civilisation is of West European origin. Since the Middle Ages 
Finns have travelled to European capitals to study and do 
business. The idea that Finland is knocking on the door of 
Europe for the first time gravely distorts the historical facts. 
  The profound European transition that started in the late 
1980s has led us to assess our European policies in an 
open-minded way. In this exercise, we have been guided by our 
postwar policy of neutrality and active economic intergration. 
Many things have changed around us while some others have not. 
  In the modern age, Finland's economic links have always 
pointed to West Europe. More than two-thirds of our foreign 
trade is carried out with our EU and European Free Trade 
Association partners. Germany, Sweden and Britain top the list 
of our individual trading partners. Finnish companies have 
vigorously broadened their activities abroad. Nokia, Neste, 
Repola, Outokumpu Kemira, Metra, Enso, Valmet and many other 
names with a Finnish ring remind European business people of our 
industries' high level of skills. 
  In order to grow and prosper, Finland needs access to 
Europe's single market. Much of this essential aim has been 
accomplished through the recently enacted European Economic 
Area. But to have real influence where the decisions on the 
political and economic future of our continent are taken, we 
have applied for membership of the EU. 
  We also trust that we can make a positive contribution. The 
Nordic candidates, in particular, would bring the Union new 
territories and natural resources. But more than that, they 
would bring developed, stable societies, valuable traditions and 
advanced economies. 
  It has not been difficult to find common ground on 
enlargement. To many observers, the process has seemed quite 
straightforward, apart from the many technicalities which always 
abound in issues of integration. While this overall picture has 
been largely correct, it has perhaps concealed a number of real 
problems that must be settled. 
  Therefore, no one should be surprised that now, in the 
final straight, we have a set of tough issues on our hands. As 
a rule, the difficulties in question stem from a single source: 
our unique geographical location and harsh climate. In the 
negotiations we are genuinely seeking to ensure that Finland 
will be able to reach the objectives of the various EU policies. 
We have to find innovative solutions to problems such as short 
grow ing seasons, harsh winters and long distances in a sparsely 
populated country. 
  These handicaps are permanent and can be compensated for 
only 
through a permanent support system based on clear and objective 
criteria. One possibility would be to use the criterion of 
latitude, in line with that of altitude already used in hill 
farming, to define less-favoured agricultural areas. 
  We are convinced that without proper solutions to these 
problems, Finland as a whole, and our rural areas in particular, 
will face untenable consequences. Both our politicians and most 
of our people are keenly aware of that. A number of EU studies 
also support that conclusion. 
  In spite of the recent polls in favour of EU membership, I 
believe that ultimately the terms of accession will be decisive. 
Therefore, my government can only submit to referendum a 
negotiated result which meets our basic requirements. 
  In these circumstances, our firm choice is to press ahead 
with the negotiations under the tight schedule that we have 
agreed to observe. 
  While we fully recognise the advantages involved in 
completing the negotiations quickly, in view of the approaching 
end of the European Parliament's term, we cannot make the 
timetable more important than the substance of our assessment. 
  We need a satisfactory set of terms for accession and we are 
prepared to fight hard for our corner in the remaining 
negotiations. As far as I can recall, a similar spirit 
characterised the final phases of previous enlargement 
negotiations. 
  We understand that the solutions to our agricultural and 
regional problems must be tailored to meet our specific needs. 
In this way we can avoid any spillover of the Nordic support 
systems. 
  Finally, let me draw attention to one further aspect. The 
accession process with we Finns may occasionally prove to be 
tedious, but once happily concluded EU partners will be able to 
count on our solidarity, common sense and seriousness in all EU 
affairs. It lies deep in the Finnish character to keep one's 
word and stick to one's commitments. We can be stubborn but 
only on issues of vital interest to us. Even there, we are 
always open to pragmatic solutions if they are honestly designed 
to take our concerns into account. 
  Finland's European policy is based on a practical assessment 
of our own needs and of European political and economic 
developments. EU membership offers answers to many of our 
aspirations, but only if the terms of our accession properly 
take into account our specific circumstances.

<F P=106> [Odd Inge Skjaevesland report: "Steady Increase in Trade </F>
With the EU Countries"] 
  [Text] Figures from the Central Statistical Bureau show 
that exports to the developing countries are growing faster than 
imports from these countries. Norway's exports and imports from 
January to November 1993 have been compared with the figures for 
the first eleven months of last year. The figures embrace all 
types of goods, including oil and gas. 
  The trend is that we are trading less with the Nordic area 
and EFTA [European Free Trade Association], of which we are a 
member today, and more with the EU [European Union], of which we 
have applied to become a member. Norwegian exports increased 
from 198 billion to 206 billion kroner, while imports rose from 
147 billion to 154 billion kroner in the first eleven months of 
last year. 
  In particular, there was no increase in exports to EU 
countries Britain and the Netherlands. By tradition we have 
never sold more to anyone than we have to the British, and last 
year there was an increase of over 3 billion kroner to a total 
of 51 billion kroner. Another large market for Norwegian goods 
is Germany. 
  While we have bought a little more from Denmark, exports to 
Denmark fell by 2 billion kroner -- almost one fifth. Exports 
and imports to and from Sweden both fell by 1 billion kroner. 
  The import of goods from Asia to Norway increased in value 
from 18 to 22 billion kroner. Trade with China increased 
markedly. Norwegian exports to the huge Chinese market almost 
doubled in a year. But we still buy almost twice as much from 
the Chinese as well sell to them.

  [Text] Davos (DPA) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl does 
not believe there is any magic formula for resolving the Bosnian 
crisis. During the opening of the World Economic Forum in Davos 
this evening, he said this was the truth, even if it had to be 
said with "anger and bitterness." The primary aim remains "to 
guarantee the supply of humanitarian aid to the people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  All military experts were agreed that a comprehensive 
"ground 
intervention aimed at ending the war would require many hundreds 
of thousands of troops." Such an operation would involve many 
victims, not least among the civilian population. "The question 
as to whether lasting peace could be secured in this manner is 
still open." As war has not been banished from Europe once and 
for all, the European Union will have to do everything it can 
"to develop an effective and credible common foreign and 
security policy."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italo-British Proposal on East </F>
Europe Gaining Ground"] 
  [Text] Rome, 24 Jan (ANSA) -- The Italo-British proposal to 
associate East European countries to the foreign, security and 
judicial policies of the European Union is winning the favor of 
the European Commission, according Leon Brittan, Commissioner 
for external trade relations, following his meeting here Monday 
[24 January] with Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta. 
  Brittan went on to add how he, personally, was greatly in 
favor of the proposal which had been jointly presented to the 
European Union [EU] by Andreatta and British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd. 
  In a meeting with the press, Brittan went on to say how he 
was "very impressed by the determination with which the Italian 
government has moved forward with political and economic 
reforms" adding how Rome's action has been "important for all of 
Europe." 
  According to the EU executive commissioner, it is also 
essential that "Italy be a founding partner in monetary union as 
it was for the birth of the European Union." 
  For his part, Foreign Minister Andreatta told the press how 
he and Brittan had spoken "in a very explicit way" about their 
expectations for this year which will see, among other things, 
the end of Jacques Delors' term as President of the European 
Commission. "I pointed out," Andreatta said, "how it will be the 
next Italian government which will adopt a position on these 
arguments... I also urged that he take part in the debate on 
these problems during the European election campaign, in order 
to clarify certain points which have made our public opinion 
somewhat suspicious in his regards." 
  Brittan, in fact, in recent months took very defined 
positions in European matters which raised strong opinions in 
Italy, in particular regarding the steel industry and state aid 
to industry. 
  Italian Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi this evening also had 
"long and cordial" talks with European Commission Vice-President 
Sir Leon Brittan on the GATT trade accord, the prospects for 
boosting world trade, and reinforcing European Union monetary 
and economic integration while making sure that "national public 
opinion and productive sectors" share the EU governments' aims, 
the premier's office reported. 
  Brittan shared Ciampi's concerns in these areas and stressed 
their importance for EU enlargement and trade competitiveness, 
the premier's office communique said.

<F P=106> [Dietrich Zwaetz commentary: "Everything at the Same Time"] </F>
  [Text] Is the United States sick? No, in his State of the 
Union Address Bill Clinton could not and did not want that 
impression to be created. Yet, if one analyzes Clinton's 
report, then one finds that it contains ample proof that 
American society today is not healthy, and cannot be healthy, 
because of the omissions of Clinton's predecessor. Clinton had 
to try to strike this peculiar rhetorical balance to make clear 
the urgent nature of the issues that most concern him. 
  There are 58 million Americans who lack sufficient 
protection 
against illness -- this figure that Clinton gave must also come 
as a surprise to statisticians, because until now it was said 
that only 37 million citizens lack insurance. State expenditure 
on welfare has been badly structured and it imposes an 
exceptional burden on the public purse. Clinton's actual words 
were: "If we allow our health care system to operate in the 
same way as before, Americans will receive less assistance, have 
fewer opportunities to choose their doctors, and have to pay 
higher bills." The president sees this as being the point of 
departure for his next reforms. His plans for 1994 are even 
more ambitious than those for his first year in office. Clinton 
himself said what had only been said by his critics so far: "We 
must tackle both things at the same time" -- that is, institute 
health care and welfare reforms at the same time. In 1993 too, 
he addressed many issues at the same time. 
  Bill Clinton is taking advantage of a favorable situation. 
In his first two years in office, he succeeded in settling two 
extremely difficult trade policy problems at the same time -- 
NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] and the GATT 
negotiations -- because despite opposition from within his own 
political camp, he practically decided on reducing the budget 
and increasing taxes at the same time and believes that he can 
overcome the institutional weaknesses of the presidency 
vis-a-vis Congress in the future too. He is burdening his 
government and congressmen with a mammoth program and has 
praised them for their work in the previous year, when he could 
have laws passed without using the presidential veto. If there 
were presidential elections now and not until 1996, Clinton 
would have a good opportunity to win once again. Despite the 
reports of affairs that have surfaced recently, the respect that 
he enjoys among people is at its highest point since he took 
office a year ago. Acting in a politically wise way, the 
president has attributed positive economic trends to himself: 
the lowest interest rates for 20 years as well as the lowest 
inflation rate for two decades (that is wrong, they were lower 
under Reagan in 1986) and an opportunity for Americans to get 
rid of high mortgage burdens of the past by means of debt 
rescheduling and lower interest rates. 
  The president is proceeding in the right direction in one 
respect: his free market orientation. Despite the social 
democratic direction of his economic policies, he is placing an 
astonishing amount of store on market forces -- even by the 
health reform, which the market is to complete with its own laws 
once it has been prompted by the government.

  [Text] The return of our troops from Somalia is continuing. 
Our troops must leave the country by 31 March. Carmen Lasorella 
interviewed Carmine Fiore, the commander of the troops. 
  [Begin recording] [Lasorella] General, within two months 
everyone will be back home. Will the mission in Somalia remain 
unfulfilled? 
  [Fiore] The mission in Somalia is not unfulfilled; it is not 
yet finished. We intervened in the country as part of a team -- 
an international team. We must neither have the presumption nor 
the worry of trying to resolve the problem on our own. We are 
leaving the game at this point, but other players are coming 
onto the field. Let's hope that they play the game as well if 
not better than we did. 
  [Lasorella] The United Nations set itself schedules and 
objectives. Neither these objectives nor these deadlines were 
reached. We cannot speak of success, so what can you say about 
the current situation? 
  [Fiore] As I said before, the mission has not finished yet. 
The results will only be added up at the end. 
  [Lasorella] You have gone through a notable experience. What 
must be strengthened -- more planning, more coordination, 
perhaps less waste of energy? 
  [Fiore] There are two main problems. One concerns the Armed 
Forces, and we will study this problem in great depth; the 
other, in my opinion, concerns administration. There should be 
greater cooperation between the ministries in order to improve 
our effort. 
  [Lasorella] So we could have done more? 
  [Fiore] We could certainly have done more. 
  [Lasorella] There are two months left. Do you think that 
they will be difficult months? 
  [Fiore] I think so. We must remember that the game is not 
over yet. It will be difficult, especially in the final days.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/LAR: "Mr. Delcroix Back From Moscow: </F>
Russian Doctrine Soon To be Explained?"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 27 Jan (BELGA) -- Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev is due to visit NATO in May to explain the content 
of new Russian military doctrine -- as approved on 2 November by 
the Kremlin, but only the broad outlines of which have been made 
public -- a source close to the national Defense Ministry 
indicated on Thursday [27 January]. 
  General Grachev in fact indicated to his Belgian 
counterpart, 
Mr. Leo Delcroix -- during the latter's visit to Russia on 
Tuesday and Wednesday -- that he was prepared to come and 
explain this doctrine to NATO leaders, members of the minister's 
entourage reported. 
  This Russian briefing -- which NATO is eagerly awaiting -- 
has already been reported on repeated occasions. Initially 
scheduled for last December, it was postponed until two days 
after the NATO summit on January 10 and 11 and then subsequently 
cancelled, observers recall. 
  According to a colleague of Mr. Delcroix, Gen. Gratchev 
could 
come and deliver his briefing at the time of the joint meeting 
of NATO defense ministers and their East European "partners" 
which is planned for late May in Brussels. The Belgian minister 
will inform NATO of this offer on the part of Russia, the 
national Defense Ministry added. 
  Diplomatic sources report that NATO is already in possession 
of 24 of the 27 pages of the document on the new Russian 
military doctrine. The three secret pages could concern the 
sometimes difficult relations between Russia and Ukraine -- 
notably following the reluctance of Kiev to dismantle its 
strategic nuclear weapons as laid down in the StART-1 nuclear 
disarmament treaty, and as ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament 
in November 1993. 
  Mr. Delcroix also invited his Russian counterpart to pay an 
official visit to Belgium next April, and the two men are also 
to pay a joint visit to a contingent of Belgian and Russian blue 
helmets in eastern Croatia. The minister returned on Wednesday 
evening from a two-day visit to Russia during which he became 
the first Westerner to visit the ballistic nuclear missile base 
of Bologoye, located between Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
  Mr. Delcroix -- who was accompanied by Major General John 
Schellemans, his principal private secretary, and Lieutenant 
General Jose Charlier, his chief of staff -- was taking up a 
"personal invitation" from Gen. Grachev. 
  The Belgian delegation was able to visit the Russian 
strategic missile command in Moscow -- a force consisting of 
some 200,000 men -- and, at a launch site, a silo containing an 
SS-17 intercontinental missile with multiple warheads and a 
range of 11,000 kms. Access to these sites had previously been 
denied to any foreigners and even to the highest Russian 
authorities. 
  Members of the Russian military indicated to the Belgian 
delegation that nuclear weapons inherited from the former Soviet 
Union were being kept "completely under control," the same 
source indicated. 
  At a meeting to discuss problems of international security, 
Mr. Delcroix and Gen. Grachev again raised in particular the 
Partnership for Peace proposal that NATO has made to its former 
enemies in East Europe. This program seeks to increase 
political and military cooperation with the countries of Central 
and East Europe with a view to eventual NATO membership for some 
of them. 
  According to Mr. Delcroix' office, Gen. Grachev has 
expressed 
an interest in this partnership, stressing that in future it 
should guarantee peace and stability in Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal </F>
United Services Insitute, London: "France's False Sense of 
Security"] 
  [Text] Behind the razzmatazz that accompanied the recent 
NATO summit, the European Union [EU] is preparing for its own 
grand initiative in East Europe. NATO has its Partnership for 
Peace; the EU is now offering a "stability pact." The thinking 
behind these two grand proposals is almost identical: an 
assumption that the West remains stable while the East is 
"unstable," coupled with a desire to do everything--except what 
really matters. Instead of membership of NATO, the East 
Europeans have "partnerships" and, instead of entry to the EU, 
they are supposed to be content with a new pact. Like NATO's 
"partnerships," the EU's pacts could be a prelude to substantial 
Western involvement, but only if the West Europeans are prepared 
to follow words with deeds. 
  The stability pact was originally concocted by the French 
prime minister, Edouard Balladur, more than a year ago. At the 
beginning, it was just a half-baked device which allowed a new 
right-wing French administration to put its stamp on the 
country's foreign policy, hitherto assumed to be the exclusive 
preserve of its Socialist president. Mr Balladur's initial plan 
was based on the simple observation that former Communist states 
are beset by potential ethnic and territorial disputes and that, 
although most have expressed an interest in joining the European 
Union, their readiness to co-operate among themselves was 
noticeable by its absence. In an attempt to dissociate the 
Union from the Yugoslav debacle, the Balladur plan suggested 
establishing a network of treaties between the East Europeans, 
all intended to settle their bilateral problems and thereby 
prevent future violence. So far, so good, but hardly profound 
or even convincing. 
  The French had a credibility problem in East Europe which 
the 
Balladur plan did little to dispel. Widely perceived to be 
against a continued American military presence on the Continent 
and opposed to the speedy eastward expansion of either the Union 
or NATO, the French lost one diplomatic battle after another in 
the dying days of their former Socialist administration. 
President Mitterrand's proposal for a European "confederation," 
a recycled Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, 
was greeted with irritation and a highly embarrassing public 
rebuke from the Czech president, Vaclav Havel. 
  But there was worse. Balladur's original proposal envisaged 
the possibility of "minor" frontier adjustments, a horrifying 
prospect for many East European states and an idea which, 
interestingly, was also rejected by the Hungarians, the nation 
traditionally thought to have most to gain from any border 
revisions. Furthermore, the French were initially vague about 
U.S. participation in the plan, so heightening suspicions that 
their main aim was still to drive a wedge between Washington and 
the Europeans. Finally, the implication that, once the East 
Europeans had concluded bilateral treaties, these could be 
upheld by Brussels raised the spectre of security guarantees of 
the worst kind: ones given by an institution--the EU--that still 
has none of the necessary military instruments. 
  Much of the criticism was unfair. Balladur did not advocate 
territorial revision; he merely wanted the possibility of 
frontier adjustments kept under review, should it be 
contemplated by the negotiating parties themselves--a principle 
that already exists in international law. Moreover, the French 
never suggested that, in return for signing stability treaties, 
the East Europeans would be offered security guarantees. 
Nevertheless, the mere mention of this possibility elicited 
universal criticism, an indication of just how little the French 
thought through the implications of their ideas. 
  Unabashed, however, Balladur applied the approach that has 
by 
now become his trademark: dogged determination, coupled with 
occasional pragmatism. And he was helped by the British who, 
though harbouring grave reservations about the proposal, did 
everything possible to accommodate him. A team comprising the 
brighter bureaucrats in the European Commission in Brussels 
ultimately ironed out the differences and the Americans were 
kept informed. The result was the stability pact, adopted by 
the Union weeks before NATO's summit stole the limelight. 
  Gone are all implicit references to the possibility of 
territorial revision, security guarantees, or conditions for 
eventual EU membership. Instead, the pact envisages a process of 
consultation, bilateral and multilateral, starting with a summit 
in Paris this April. After the initial meeting, individual East 
European governments will be expected to discuss their problems 
with each other, with the Union standing ready to help when 
required. Further, since the process is an exercise in 
preventing future, not existing wars, the republics of former 
Yugoslavia are to be excluded. 
  Although no final list of countries concerned has been 
provided, it is clear that the process will involve primarily 
the six countries of Central and East Europe that have signed a 
treaty of association with the Union, but it will also involve 
some neighbouring countries, the Baltic republics, the U.S. and 
international institutions with a direct stake in the 
proceedings. The loose supervision of the treaties that may 
ensue will be left to the Conference on Security and 
Co-operation in Europe, so avoiding the need to create new 
institutions. So far, so good, but hardly relevant. 
  Despite all protestations to the contrary, the plan still 
regards East Europeans as novices, people who must be taught how 
to eat with a knife and fork at a Western table. The Paris 
conference does not intend to discuss Northern Ireland, the 
Basque country or Corsica; all these problems are supposedly of 
a different order from the difficulties of the Slovaks, 
Hungarians, Romanians or Bulgarians. For years, France has 
scuppered all attempts to define an international system to 
protect ethnic minorities; only last November four Muslim French 
girls who dared arrive for school wearing headscarves were 
suspended from classes until they abandoned their religious 
custom, an event that would have been roundly condemned in any 
East European country. The East Europeans are therefore 
expected to discuss minority protection and rights for special 
groups that few Western countries are willing to accept. 
  In one aspect, too, the planned Paris conference is 
reinventing the wheel: most of those participating from the 
East already have friendship treaties with all their neighbours, 
and not every East European state has the same problem: Poland 
and the Czech Republic, for instance, are relatively homogenous 
states, while Hungary's ethnic difficulty is with its kinsmen 
abroad. 
  In keeping with its bureaucratic traditions, the European 
Union decreed that it should have a common foreign and security 
policy before anyone ascertained whether its members actually 
had joint foreign and security interests. The stability pact is 
now touted as evidence of how the EU can act in unison. In 
practice, it will result in just another set of anodyne 
statements distinguished only by their irrelevance. 
  The biggest contribution that the EU could make is not to 
help the East Europeans to draft new treaties or "identify" 
problems that everyone already knows exist, but to open up its 
markets to East European products, thereby giving them a 
realistic prospect of full membership of the Union. 
  But nothing of the kind is happening. The East Europeans, 
for instance, have reduced their steel production by half over 
the last 10 years, while the EU members have increased theirs by 
20 per cent. Yet the East Europeans are now accused of "dumping" 
steel on EU markets and have incurred punitive tariffs. While 
the forthcoming Paris conference is to discuss high principles, 
the bureaucrats in Brussels continue with their quotas on apples 
or beans. Never mind the facts; just feel the vision: this is 
the European Union message. Nevertheless, the mood is changing. 
NATO's latest summit opened up the possibility of military 
action by European states, using the assets of the alliance 
without direct U.S. involvement on each occasion. Many details 
still have to be defined, but this would give France the 
opportunity to draw closer to NATO and defuse the demarcation 
disputes that have paralysed Europe since the end of the Cold 
War. 
  The meeting which took place in London yesterday between the 
French, German and British defence ministers is one step in this 
direction. Once the West's internal disputes abate, it would be 
possible to take a serious look at East Europe's wider security 
needs as well. Paradoxically, the stability pact that Balladur 
originally launched in order to gain some control over President 
Mitterrand's foreign policy has now become an irrelevance, a 
diversion that Mitterrand can host while serious decisions about 
the Continent are taken elsewhere. 
  And the EU's foreign and security policy? It is, as the 
bureaucrats say, still "evolving."

as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] Mr. Rabin tells the Council of Europe assembly that 
"I come from Jerusalem to tell you that the government of Israel 
yearns for peace... Israel will be very forthcoming in its quest 
for peace, but it will not compromise on its security. As chief 
of staff during the Six-Day War, I promised myself that I would 
be the last commander of the Israel Defense Forces who would 
have to face untenable borders... If we have security, we will 
also have peace." Thus, Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Rabin, 
addressing the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe 
on Wednesday [26 January]. Mr. Rabin added that he was 
convinced that "temporary setbacks and difficulties in our 
negotiations with the PLO will not stop us from reaching an 
agreement. We do not have any territorial designs in Lebanon 
and our problems with Jordan could be solved fairly easily. 
However, Lebanon will not budge without Syria's blessing," 
asserted Mr. Rabin, who noted that "our negotiations with Syria 
have been, since their beginning, serious and open, and progress 
has been made." The Prime Minister called on President al-Asad 
to "walk the extra mile to meet us in the middle of the road for 
peace." 
  Mr. Rabin also requested Europe to "increase its involvement 
in the peacemaking process" because Europe's support can 
consolidate peace in its real dimension: open borders, free 
movement of goods and people, coexistence and cooperation. The 
prime minister nevertheless said he feels a certain 
"ambivalence" in the European attitude toward Israel and would 
like to see more understanding concerning his country's 
political positions, security concerns and economic needs. For 
years, he said, "we have heard sermons and advice" but only a 
small minority of European states have taken concrete steps to 
eliminate the Arab boycott. In his view, no one would have 
dreamt, after the progress achieved in recent months, that the 
boycott would still be used as an "illegitimate weapon against 
Israel." Regarding the new agreement the European Union is to 
negotiate with Israel, Mr. Rabin affirmed that it must take 
account of Israel's ability to contribute to the economic 
activity of Europe and said "Israel's role as a stabilizing 
factor and locomotive for growth in the region cannot be 
minimized."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC/Enlargement: Conclusion of </F>
Negotiations in a Marathon From 25 to 28 February (With Possible 
Prolongation to Beginning-March -- The Commission Intends 
Completing the Draft `Joint Positions' This Week"; as released 
by Brussels TEXTLINE database)] 
  [Text] In order to respect the beginning-March deadline, 
set by the heads of government for concluding accession 
negotiations, the Council's Greek Presidency has decided to 
convene two extra ministerial sessions in February, after the 
one already planned for 7 February. These will take place on 
21-22 February and from 25 to 28 February (thus including 
Saturday and Sunday), with the possibility of a prolongation to 
beginning-March "by stopping the clock." Each session will 
comprise separate meetings with each of the four candidate 
countries: Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. In principle, 
negotiations should end with the four candidates at the same 
time. 
  For its part, the European Commission said that it proposed 
completing drawing up the draft "joint positions" under its 
competency this week (including the supplements relating to 
agriculture), so that the Council is in possession of all the 
texts. The budgetary aspects (participation by the candidate 
countries in common expenses) will, however, not be included in 
this package. It is, moreover, worth mentioning that: 

  -  Greek 
Secretary General for European Affairs Yannos Kranidiotis 
confirmed that Greece had asked that the future financing of the 
Arctic regions under regional policy be the subject of an ad hoc 
fund. This request is said to be supported by the so-called 
cohesion countries (Spain, Portugal, Ireland). According to the 
current rules, only those regions where per capita income is 
less than 75 percent of the Community average can benefit from 
funding under objective n.1 of regional policy; however, this is 
not the case for the Arctic regions in the candidate countries, 
whence the need for an ad hoc fund; 
  -  Finnish Prime Minister Esko 
Aho, having met European Commissioner Hans van den Broek, 
reaffirmed that his country regarded as essential keeping 
subsidies for its farmers throughout the territory. Regarding 
this, Finland rejects the Commission's proposal (which is not 
yet a "joint position" by the Twelve): According to Mr. Aho (who 
then went on to France and Spain) his position is finding 
increasing understanding among member states and he had "reason 
to believe" that the Commission itself would revise its 
position; 
  -  Mr. Kranidiotis and Mr. Van den Broek confirmed that 
the state of negotiations was not uniform: Norway in particular 
is behind. Whatever, Mr. Van den Broek told MEPs [members of 
European Parliament], it is up to the candidate countries 
themselves to decide on breaking the parallelism for closing 
negotiations. 
  The text of the agreements will not be available in March, 
and Van den Broek urges MEPs to consider the possibility of 
beginning the examination procedures on the basis of a 
comprehensive report. 
  Speaking to the European Parliament's Committee on External 
Economic Relations, Commissioner Van den Broek declared that, 
whatever happened, the texts of the agreements would not be 
available at the beginning of March. It involves around 10,000 
pages to be drawn up in 9 languages; even if negotiations end on 
28 February, we shall need to wait for early May before having 
all the texts at our disposal. He then urged the MEPs to 
consider the possibility of starting the procedures (with a view 
to an "assent" in the EP) as soon as negotiations ended, on the 
basis of a comprehensive report from the Commission and Council, 
it being understood that the assent would only come in May, when 
all the texts were available. There is therefore no question of 
asking Parliament to decide on the principle of accession as 
suggested by some jurists; whatever the interpretation of 
Article O of the Maastricht Treaty, it would be politically 
unthinkable that the compulsory assent should not be based on 
the complete and definitive results of negotiations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Environment -- Six Member States Set </F>
up Cogen Europe (Association for Promotion of Cogeneration 
Technology (CHP) Throughout Europe)"; as released by Brussels 
TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] The Cogen Europe association has been set up to 
promote the implementation throughout Europe of cogeneration 
schemes, a technology of certain ecological interest and 
allowing major savings of primary energy, which is also known as 
CHP (combined heat and power). It was launched this month with 
the support of six member states (UK, Netherlands, Spain, 
Germany, France and Greece) and with the financial aid of the 
Energy Directorate of the European Commission. Its first 
chairman is Ton van der Does, director of the Dutch CHP office. 
Cogen Europe, with its main office in London, will have the 
task of: 
  (a) identifying the regulatory and institutional barriers to 
cogeneration development in Europe and acting to reduce them at 
the policy level; 
  (b) collaborating on relevant issues with other key European 
energy associations and industries; 
  (c) quantifying the potential for cogeneration in Europe. 
  Speaking at the launch, Mr. van der Does said that the 
association will work toward better cooperation between key 
actors in the European energy scene in order to "establish a 
clear and positive policy framework for cogeneration." "The 
Brussels institutions now have a professional and focused 
organization with which they can work to resolve the many 
challenges facing cogeneration in the 1990s," he continued. The 
creation of this association, he feels, reflects the absence of 
clear recognition by EU and many national policy makers of the 
significant benefits of cogeneration schemes, whether 
industrial, small-scale or city-wide. While conventional power 
generation is often only 35 percent efficient (up to 65 percent 
of the energy potential being released as waste heat), 
cogeneration technology stops this by using the heat for 
industry, commerce and home heating. Cogeneration therefore 
increases the overall efficiency of energy use -- up to 85 
percent and beyond -- giving primary energy savings of about 
one-third.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Parliament Wants Community </F>
To Give Impetus To Follow-up on Earth Summit"; as released by 
Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] The World Environment Fund, the result of a 
Franco-German initiative which was launched as a three-year 
experimental phase by the World Bank, must be reformed if it is 
to run efficiently, and must favor projects of a local scope in 
order to allow sustainable endogenous development respecting 
biodiversity. This is what the Parliament [European Parliament, 
EP] called for when it adopted the report by French Liberal 
Jean-Thomas Nordmann, who underlines in particular the 
importance of the European Union's participation in the Fund, a 
participation that should facilitate the coordinating role in 
the world environmental problems facing the Union. 
  Finally, the EP wants the mention "token entry" which is 
currently indicated in the Community budget for the financing of 
the Fund to be replaced in future by appropriate amounts. The 
EP fears that the existence of the Fund itself is in jeopardy 
after the expiry in June 1994 of the temporary period of its 
operating. The EP has also adopted the report by Spanish 
Liberal Gudalupe Ruiz- Gimenez Aguilar on the follow-up by the 
European Union [EU] of the implementation of "Agenda 21" adopted 
at the Earth Summit in Rio, requesting in particular that the 
Commission and member states add to the ECU3 billion promised in 
Rio additional resources intended for the implementation of 
"Agenda 21." The Commission is also invited to include in all 
international trade agreements a clause on the protection of 
natural resources, and to propose to the Council a Green Paper 
on trade and the environment. As for member states, they must, 
according to the Parliament, establish in 1994 committees and 
national plans for sustainable development accompanied by 
mechanisms inherent in the formulation of indicators of 
sustainable development. During the common debate on the two 
reports, Mr. Nordmann, underlining the Environmental Fund's 
operating problems, invited the Community to play its 
coordinating role fully whereas according to him the World Bank 
should be limited to a role of technical support for projects. 
Mrs. Ruiz-Gimenez Aguilar insisted in particular on the 
implementation of conventions on biodiversity and the climatic 
change and underscored the need to have additional financial 
means to implement the "calendar 21" adopted at the Earth 
Summit. The European Union must abide by the commitments 
entered into at Rio, the MEP [member of European Parliament] 
said. 
  European Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro shared the view 
of the MEPs about the need to provide renewed impetus to the 
implementation of the Rio decisions and believed that the 5th 
program on environmental matters constituted a strategic 
framework that should enable bolstering the Union's action in 
this area.

<F P=106> [Article signed ABS: "Minister Urbain Returns From Damascus: </F>
Solve the Debt Problem"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 26 Jan (BELGA) -- On his return from 
Damascus, where he paid an official visit on Monday and Tuesday 
[24-25 January], Foreign Trade and European Affairs Minister 
Robert Urbain reviewed his mission to Syria, a country that 
offers good prospects for cooperation following the signing of 
the peace agreements in Palestine. The Belgian minister also 
admitted, however, that obstacles remain, as Syria has not 
serviced its foreign debt for several years now. 
  Although for Belgium this debt is under 500 million Belgian 
francs, this situation has resulted in Syria being unfavorably 
appraised by the National Export Guarantee Office, which has 
refused to cover the "Syrian" risk. 
  Minister Urbain, who met with the principle ministers 
responsible for the economy (economic affairs, foreign trade, 
plan, energy) while in Damascus, has suggested that the debt 
problem should be the subject of exploratory discussions in 
Damascus between the National Export Guarantee Office and the 
Syrian authorities in order to rapidly reach solutions 
acceptable to both parties. If the debt problem could be solved 
-- either within the "Paris Club" or in any other way -- trade 
would then quickly intensify, he believes. 
  In the meantime, Minister Urbain can only observe that there 
is a clear trade balance in favor of the UEBL [Belgo-Luxembourg 
Economic Union]. 
  In 1992, the UEBL exported goods worth 3.6 billion Belgian 
francs to Syria, and worth 2.9 billion Belgian francs during the 
first nine months of 1993 (foodstuffs and manufactured goods). 
  The UEBL imported goods worth 432 million Belgian francs 
from 
Syria in 1992, and worth just 76 million Belgian francs during 
the first nine months of 1993. There is therefore a clear 
imbalance. The need to correct this is made even more evident as 
Syria's economic and financial situation has shown a marked 
improvement over the last two years: The Gulf countries have 
stopped their aid to the country and domestic oil production has 
increased. 
  Also, Damascus is conducting an open foreign policy and has 
even started a process to privatize the economy. Syria's needs 
in the infrastructure and energy sectors -- both sectors of 
interest to Belgian industry -- are major. 
  During the recent mission, contacts were already established 
between Syrian partners and Belgian companies in the 
construction and telecommunications sectors. 
  A UEBL-Syria economic cooperation agreement will be signed 
shortly, Minister Urbain has announced. This will make it 
possible to arrange regular sessions of a joint economic 
committee with representatives from the three countries. 
  Damascus has also shown interest in a financial cooperation 
between the two issuing authorities (the Belgian National Bank 
and the Syrian Central Bank), in the following sectors in 
particular: staff training, bank note printing, financial 
transactions between banking institutions.

`Premature Political Decision'"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 18 Jan (BELGA) -- "By virtue of the 
principle of the division of powers, I must, as a member of the 
executive authority, abstain from any declaration concerning 
this case. Personally, I have confidence in the conclusions of 
the special committee and want it to be able to finish its work 
completely undisturbed." This was the substance of the reply 
the prime minister gave to Parliament on Wednesday [19 January] 
in response to a series of questions about the Agusta affair. 
  Apart from Armand de Decker (PRL) [Liberal Reformation 
Party] 
and Olivier Maingain (FDF) [French-speaking Front], all the 
contributors came from Flemish opposition parties. Herman 
Lauwers (VU) [People's Union], Mieke Vogels (Agalev) [Flemish 
Greens], Willy Courtois (VLD) [Flemish Liberals and Democrats] 
and Francis Van Den Eynde [Flemish Bloc] all called for the 
resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Guy Come "in the name of 
political ethics." 
  Such a decision, they insisted, would in no way prejudge the 
guilt of the person concerned, but would on the contrary allow 
him to defend himself more calmly and make a small contribution 
to restoring citizens'confidence in the political world. 
  "Mr. Come himself deplores and contests the accusations made 
against him," Jean-Luc Dehaene replied. 
  "He feels fully capable of carrying out his ministerial 
duties. Taking account of the current position of the legal 
procedures and the fundamental principles of our legal system, 
it is therefore premature to take a political decision," the 
prime minister stated. 
  During the replies, Herman Lauwers, parliamentary leader of 
the VU, told the head of government: "You have just given one 
of the most dangerous replies that you could have given for the 
future of this country and democracy."
