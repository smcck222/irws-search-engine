<F P=106> [Article by Remy Deveze: "Video: The Multitrack </F>
Revolution"] 
  [Text] In the middle of the laboratory, a silver plinth is 
lit by a low angled light. The device standing on it is 
scarcely larger than a packet of cigarettes, but all attention 
is focused on it. The lack of a cover reveals an 8-mm-format 
video cassette. The electronics surrounding it would seem bare 
to anyone who has ever taken apart a home video recorder. 
Behind the plinth is a television. A man in a white coat 
standing in front of it operates the remote control. The screen 
shows successive clips of a Brazilian sitcom, the latest UB40 
video, a cartoon, etc. At first glance, this is nothing 
extraordinary. Closer examination reveals, however, that the 
television is not plugged into any antenna, satellite dish, or 
cable network. The only wire coming out of the set runs into 
the curious device on show on its silver plinth. The engineer 
is flicking channels...on a video tape. 
  This kind of luxury may appear banal to blase consumers, but 
it is a real technological miracle. The device, a high-density 
video player and recorder, is capable of storing -- on the 
smallest video cassette on the market, the Hi8 -- as much data 
as can be contained on 50,000 computer diskettes, 200 compact 
disks, or a semitrailer crammed with encyclopedias. The small 
marvel can also read one or more channels and simultaneously 
record about 10 others. Great, I will have one, you might say. 
Not so fast. The product is still kept under lock and key in 
Thomson CSF's Central Research Laboratory (LCR). 
  Located in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, between the 
Chevreuse and Bievre valleys, the world detection specialist's 
research and development sector employs 330 people. Everyday 
work here includes logical constraint programming, the study of 
submicron structures, and the design of millimetric transistors. 
Video cassette channel hopping was designed by the Magnetism 
Group, one of the laboratory's seven branches. Normally, this 
team works on applications closer to Thomson CSF's main sectors 
of activity, such as high-temperature superconductors, one of 
the most promising electromagnetic detection technologies. 
  Research sometimes finds openings on the consumer 
electronics 
market. Thanks to the Magnetism Group, Thomson already receives 
royalties each time a CD player is sold somewhere. This is 
because the two inventors of the compact disk, Philips and Sony, 
used some Thomson patents in the laser read head. The new video 
recorder falls into much the same mold. It is of interest to 
all sectors that need small-size mass memory storage devices, 
whether for the on-board electronics of a fighter plane or the 
space shuttle, in a desktop computer, or simply in the home. 
Indeed, ordinary TV lies at the root of the research project, 
with much speculation surrounding its future. In the hubbub of 
possibilities for the future, one thing is certain: Consumers 
always want more TV programs. Another certainty is that TV of 
tomorrow (or the day after tomorrow) will be digital. Video 
signals will be recorded, carried, and read as data bits, with 
sound and picture converted into huge packets of noughts and 
ones. In this way, picture quality should be improved and its 
format enlarged. 
  All this assumes that giant storage media are required to 
store the mass of data contained in a film, for example. A 
three-hour, high-definition, wide-screen feature film requires 
10 to the power of 12 bits (one terabit). To fit this 1 terabit 
of data onto a small, already-marketed storage medium was the 
challenge taken up by the Thomson CSF researchers. They 
selected the Hi8 video cassette. Jean-Paul Castera, manager of 
LCR's Magnetism Group stated: "We are convinced that the future 
does not belong to optical film, whose recording capacity is 
limited by the laser wavelengths, but to magnetic tape." 
  Conventional video systems use recording heads attached to 
the periphery of a drum that revolves at high speed. This 
enables the data to be recorded on thin tracks laid out across 
the tape, and the relative speed between the head and the tape 
to be increased. Both aspects have considerably increased the 
recording capacity of video tape. In VHS, the track is 49 
microns wide and the drum speed is 4.8 m/s [meters per second]. 
With the Hi8 system, the track width has been reduced to 18 
microns for a speed of about 3 m/s. 
  However, with drum-based technologies, even if the track 
width were reduced to 5 microns, high-definition recordings 
would still require speeds in excess of 30 m/s. To follow such 
a thin magnetic track at a cruising speed of 108 km/h 
[kilometers per hour] would require extremely precise and 
difficult-to-manufacture mechanics (drum and loading system). 
Jean-Paul Castera stressed: "Not only does the revolving drum 
pose a big headache at very high speeds, but it also generates 
major maintenance and vibration resistance problems for the 
on-board electronics." His team quickly fell back on a fixed 
head system, as used in tape recorders. 
  This choice meant that a number of other decisions also had 
to be made. Whereas conventional video recorders use a single 
drum to read from and write to a tape, LCR separated these two 
functions. The high-density device has two heads, one for 
recording and one for playback. Splitting these two tasks had 
two advantages. The first is of particular interest to film 
professionals who are today forced, once footage has been shot, 
to rewind the tape and play it back to check on the quality of 
the recording. With the Thomson system, the cameraman can check 
the recording "live." The second advantage is that a different 
technology can be used for each of the two functions. This is 
the aspect that researchers hastened to make use of. 
  While the principle is simple, it nonetheless took LCR three 
years to manufacture the matrix head. Recording so many gaps 
[preceding word in English] on such a small area is really quite 
an exploit. The result is there for all to see, however: LCR 
researchers have fitted 384 gaps in an area 8 millimeters wide 
and just a little longer, each one of which writes a track 18 
microns wide. Now the new model, designed for VHS-type tape, is 
capable of recording 1,000 tracks 10 micron wide. This is 
enough to give a data transfer rate of 500 megabits per second, 
whereas the existing digital TV standard, MPEG [Moving Picture 
Expert Group], requires a throughput of 1.5 megabits per second. 
From a recording point of view, that is enough to store 333 
films on one VHS videotape. 
  That is not all. It is not enough to simply record -- the 
new system has to maintain the rate during playback. To meet 
this second challenge, the Thomson researchers invented a device 
that combined optical and magnetic modes. Jean-Paul Castera 
revealed: "Actually, we were lucky enough to find two 
conventional microelectronic components that corresponded 
exactly to what we were looking for: The laser diode and the 
charge coupled device (CCD). The former is widely used in 
compact disk drives and the latter is used in camcorders." 
  By combining these modestly priced and now common-technology 
components, the LCR team reached its goal of storing on one of 
today's conventional video cassettes a data transfer rate 
suitable for use with the television of tomorrow. In 1989, a 
demonstration device was presented at the Geneva physics fair. 
With electronics reduced for budgetary reasons to one-third of 
the capacity of the heads, it was already capable of recording 
three TV channels in a digital format on a Hi8 cassette. With 
the new 1,000-track matrix head, this prototype is already 
something of an ancestor. 
  This could be the start of a beautiful story. However, while 
the LCR researchers continue with their work, marketing 
constraints give them little hope of gaining their reward. 
While recognizing the merits of the high-speed device, 
Thomson's consumer electronics branch believes it to be a 
professional "niche" product (detection, aviation, electronic 
document management, etc.), rather than one destined for the 
vast home video market. The arguments put forward are that the 
system is not yet completely ready, optical memory has yet to 
show all its potential, and, above all, the standards set for 
the end of the nineties will very probably be for rotating head 
technology. 
  Forty million VHS machines are sold in the world each year. 
In this context it is difficult to impose a standard which, 
even if it uses the storage media available on the market, is 
not compatible with any other existing equipment. Moreover, 
Japanese researchers have not given up trying to improve the 
data transfer rate of VHS and other Hi8's. 
  All this explains why Thomson Consumer Electronics is taking 
a cautious stance, although it continues to finance part of 
Jean-Paul Castera's work. It is also true what they say about 
once bitten, twice shy. The European electronics industry has 
just come out of a bruising encounter with high-definition 
television [HDTV], and certainly does not want a repeat of the 
D2Mac [European transitional analog HDTV standard] syndrome. 
The little technological miracle risks spending a long time 
confined to those confidential places like the central computing 
system of an aircraft, a submarine, or the space shuttle. 
Patience is required. 
<H5>  How It Works </H5>
<H5>  Matrix Writing </H5>
  The gaps are laid out in a grid like the pixels of a CCD. To 
eliminate parasitic interference from neighboring points, the 
data comes from two sources. The current passed through air gap 
is the sum of the current coming down a column and the current 
coming along a row. The magnetic field generated by a gap is 
the sum of fields generated by these two currents. The field 
then writes a data bit if its value is greater than the minimum 
recording threshold for the tape. The trick lies in setting the 
two currents to values separately less than this threshold but 
whose sum exceeds it. Thus they leave no parasitic trace on the 
neighboring heads when their sums record the piece of data on 
the required place on the gap. This is the principle of 
"multiplexed addressing." 
<H5>  Read Process </H5>
  The CCD consists of a grid of thousands of small pixels. 
These pixels convert light into electricity. A device 
regularly collects the electrical signals coming from each 
pixel. The optical image is in this way converted into an 
electrical signal. 
  To adapt this technique to magnetic reading, Thomson made 
use 
of the Kerr effect. Take laser light, for instance. It is 
polarized, meaning that all the vibrations making it up are 
synchronized and are moving in the same direction, unlike 
sunlight. This is a bit like the difference between a 
well-aligned battalion of soldiers marching in step and the 
chaotic movement of the crowd in the subway. When laser light 
is reflected off the tape through a Kerr effect transducer, the 
polarization of the rays changes depending on the magnetic 
orientation written onto each point on the tape. The soldiers 
are still marching in step and in line, but some are leaning 
forward and others are leaning back. 
  Then all that remains is to send the laser beam back to the 
CCD sensor by placing a polarizing filter in its path. The 
battalion's final destination is a large grid where each soldier 
has his precisely assigned position -- but the ones that are 
leaning backward are intercepted and sent down a hole. As a 
result, the grid is an image of the magnetic signals recorded on 
the tape. The operation is repeated several tens of times per 
second. Once they have been decoded these signals represent 
images and sounds.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Berkenbaum: "The First Information </F>
Highway"] 
  [Excerpts] The "information highways" so dear to the 
president of the European Commission did not wait for the 
publication of his "White Paper" -- adopted last Saturday at the 
Brussels summit -- to become a reality. Yesterday, still in 
Brussels, Jacques Delors was to have inaugurated the first truly 
trans-European telecommunications network: Euro-ISDN 
(Integrated Services Digital Network). Prevented at the last 
minute from attending the ceremony, the Commission president 
charged the director general of DGXIII (EC Commission 
directorate general responsible for telecommunications) to 
represent him and to welcome the event on his behalf: "We are 
moving from the industrial era to the age of information." 
[passage omitted explaining ISDN technology, applications] 
  ISDN has remained relatively confidential until now for two 
reasons. The first reason was the national and incompatible 
nature of the early networks, leading to a lack of crossborder 
services. The second reason, an immediate consequence of this, 
was the scant enthusiasm shown by terminal manufacturers and 
service suppliers to invest in a market that was certainly 
promising but which was too limited because of the adaptations 
needed for each country. 
  It was to remedy this problem that, in 1986, the EC launched 
the idea of a jointly operated and standardized ISDN. Three 
years later, in 1989, 26 European telecommunications operators 
(including Belgacom) undertook to provide a basic set of 
pan-European services by the end of 1993. They rose to the 
challenge, and Euro-ISDN was born. The network already connects 
17 countries. Including the vast investments needed to develop 
the applications, the global cost is estimated to have already 
reached ECU 50 billion or 2,000 billion Belgian francs. 
[passage omitted] 
  Some people, however, are wondering if Euro-ISDN is not 
arriving just a little late. It is merely foreshadowing the 
future network known as broadband ISDN, which is expected to be 
introduced on a large scale as of 1995. This network, also 
backed by the European Commission, will offer much greater data 
transmission capacities and a better integration of services. 
Bringing high-resolution color faxes, high-definition 
interactive television, the transfer of medical images, etc., it 
will pull Europe headlong into the era of multimedia 
communications. Pilot projects already exist, developed by the 
major manufacturers with the backing of various European 
programs. 
  The ambition stated in Brussels last weekend is to free up 
the resources needed to put these services within everyone's 
reach by building trans-European networks. In its White Paper, 
the Commission reckons that the development of 
telecommunications in Europe will cost some ECU 150 billion over 
the next five years. To be sure, such expenditure will not be 
in vain -- by the year 2000, telecommunications should represent 
six percent of GNP of the Twelve and boost growth by six percent 
over the next 10 to 15 years. Its depths have yet to be plumbed.

<F P=106> [Article by "P.O.": "30,000-km Optical Fiber Cable From </F>
England to Japan. Consortium of Companies Will Invest Around $1 
Billion/Additional Partners Conceivable/Price Differentiation 
According to Market Conditions"] 
  [Text] London--A multinational consortium of companies 
under American leadership is presently preparing to run the 
first optical fiber cable from Great Britain to Japan. Gabriel 
Yackanich, president of the FLAG Consortium in London, has 
reported that this telecommunications link will be put into 
service at the beginning of 1996. 
  Exploration work for the precise routing of the cable is 
being performed already now by quite a number of ships. 
Yackanich estimates at "around $1 billion" the total cost of 
this 30,000-km-long optical fiber cable link between West Europe 
and the Far East. 
  While there are already cable links both across the Atlantic 
and Pacific, which each permit 400,000 to 450,000 simultaneous 
telephone connections (with at the same time a multitude of call 
capabilities), according to Yackanich the route between Europe 
and the Far East has been developed only extremely poorly in 
most national sections. 
  There are only around 17,000 telephone links via cable in 
national sections here. This applies to the Near East and across 
the Indian Ocean, for example. The new cable having a capacity 
of 120,000 connections, permitting as many as 600,000 telephone 
calls simultaneously, accordingly means multiplication of the 
intensity of offered telecommunications traffic. 
  The name FLAG in this connection stands for Fiberoptic Link 
Around the Globe. However, it is not yet possible to predict 
whether this cable will one day really encircle the earth. For 
example, the fact that New York and London are not linked with 
one another via the FLAG cable has not least legal reasons that 
are a consequence of restrictions on telecommunications 
companies in the United States. Nevertheless, its continuation 
(to America or Australia for example) has by no means been ruled 
out, as was intimated in London. 
  The FLAG cable is to have 13 stations to begin with. It will 
begin with Great Britain and extend through Gibraltar, Italy, 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, India, Thailand, 
Malaysia, Indonesia, Hongkong and Korea to Japan. However, 
additional terminal connections have by no means been ruled out. 
  The active selling of cable capacities to potential 
customers 
will begin soon and is to be concluded in the middle of next 
year. Here it will essentially be a question of postal, 
telegraph and telephone and telecommunications administrations 
as customers for FLAG, as Yackanich expressly emphasized. In 
contrast to its satellite competition, the FLAG Consortium is 
emphasizing above all the interference-free service of 
underwater cable. 
  At the same time FLAG is banking on a different kind of 
marketing policy. In contrast to the usual pricing in 
telecommunications, the absolute distance of a communication via 
the FLAG cable will play no role with regard to its price. 
Rather the "price differentiation" will be done just according 
to market conditions, and thus according to the demand. Here 
Yackanich drew a comparison with the pricing policy of the 
airlines, whose prices in broad sectors also depend not in the 
least on the distance. 
  Thus far four without exception private-sector partners 
belong to the FLAG Consortium. They include--from the United 
States--the Nynex Corporation, which is involved almost 
exclusively in the telecommunications business, and Gulf 
Associates, an investment firm. 
  The Near East partner is the Dallah Al-Baraka business group 
of Saudi Arabia, and, finally, the Japanese partner is the 
Marubeni Corp. business firm of Tokyo. The inclusion of 
additional partners, from the Near East for example, is 
considered very likely, however. 
  It is worthy of note from the service viewpoint that the 
link 
between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea will have redundancy 
for security reasons. An additional land cable is to be laid as 
a standby, besides the FLAG underwater cable that will run 
between Alexandria and Port Said and on to Suez.

<F P=106> [Article by Manfred Schmitt: "All Ways Open"] </F>
  [Text] Due to the growing demands for accessibility and the 
ability to communicate and the traffic and environmental 
problems resulting from the mobility, there will be a continuing 
trend toward mobile communication and toward transportation of 
the information instead of the person. These developments apply 
to all areas of life. At the behest of the European Commission, 
the DECT standard was developed for the wide application field 
of cordless telecommunication of voice and data in order to 
access local mobile networks. 
  The DECT standard (Digital European Cordless 
Telecommunication) represents an evolution based on the previous 
industrial (CT0) and public standards (CT1/CT1+, CT2 as interim 
ETSI standard). With its special targeting of mobility at the 
office and at home, it is increasingly used as a method of 
network access for private branch exchanges and the analog 
telephone system, as well as for wide-ranging mobile 
communication of voice and data. European manufacturers of 
telecommunications facilities such as Siemens, Alcatel, 
Ericsson, Philips and Nokia have committed themselves to use the 
DECT standard and corresponding products are being developed or 
are already available. 
  The DECT standard was defined and developed by ETSI 
(European 
Telecommunications Standardisation Institute) beginning in 1989 
and was adopted in July 1992. The EC signature nations have 
obligated themselves within the scope of an EC guideline to 
introduce DECT by 1995 and to provide the required frequencies, 
as well as to make the necessary permit regulations available on 
a voluntary basis within the framework of an EC recommendation. 
The DECT standard defines a transparent, digital aerial 
interface between a mobile unit and a base station for cordless 
telecommunication of voice and data over analog telephone 
networks, ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network], GSM [not 
further identified], package and wire-transmitted data networks 
as well as local area networks. 
  Because of the Europe-wide application area, large markets 
with enormous quantities are open to DECT, which makes rapid and 
major reduction in technological and production costs possible 
through scaling effects. Market demands, rapidly dropping 
prices, versatile application, combined with diverse advantages 
from the user's aspect, form the initial basis for successful 
opening up broad mass markets for DECT in Europe and beyond. In 
November 1992 the Federal Office for Posts and Telecommunication 
issued the German licensing regulations for DECT systems and end 
equipment and thus made the market introduction of DECT products 
possible on a broad basis. 
<H5>  Advantages for the User </H5>
  The advantages of DECT for the user derive, on the one hand, 
in general from the use of powerful mobile communication at 
home, at the office and in the future from public access as 
well, such as high accessibility/availability/communications 
ability, mobile internal communication free of charge, increased 
action/reaction speed, accelerated decision-making, faster 
transaction processing, liberal waiting times for important 
calls, higher measure of service, lower number of unsuccessful 
calls, cost/time advantage because fewer return calls are 
required, freedom of mobility during the connection and cost 
savings when moving. 
  On the other hand, many user advantages are the result of 
the 
technical concept of DECT, such as high communications quality 
through 32 kbit/s speech coding and continuous channel 
optimization, high security against wiretapping including 
through optional speech coding, high radio-technical area 
coverage and space illumination, mastery of large subscriber 
numbers or traffic density, roaming (localizing the subscriber 
through all radio cells), simple installation and expansion 
without frequency planning, the ability to integrate voice and 
data as well as investment security because of a promising 
standard and simple expansion possibility of the system. 
<H5>  Technical Features </H5>
  DECT is a cordless access method to target networks such as 
the public analog telephone net, the ISDN net and in the future 
also the GSM net. DECT offers the technical basis for 
application-specific system solutions or special DECT profiles 
in the form of a transparent aerial interface (Layer OSI 1 
through 3). DECT's protocol supply includes all procedures for 
realizing cordless end equipment and systems (authentication, 
speech encoding, mobility management) as well as all important 
standards and protocols of telecommunication (ISDN, LAN, X.25, 
X.400...) for cordless telephones and branch facilities for the 
home, office and in the future also for public networks (public 
access). 
<H5>  DECT Profiles and System Solutions </H5>
  DECT's extensively defined protocol supply enables 
definition 
and specification of application-specific system solutions for 
voice and data as well as access through the DECT aerial 
interface to various target networks such as GSM, ISDN with 
upstream DECT systems or base stations. According to an EC 
recommendation, these kinds of DECT mobile units should be able 
to work with various DECT profiles or system solutions (common 
interface). 
  The voice-oriented DECT standard ETS 300175 (Common 
Interface) and ETS 300176 (Approval Test Specification) were 
adopted in July 1992 by ETSI and made available to the public. 
At present a series of additional DECT profiles are operating at 
ETSI, for which stabile drafts will largely be available in 
1993/94, which can then already be used for development 
activities. DECT-GSM Interworking enables the cooperation of 
DECT mobile units with DECT systems which are connected to GSM 
systems; DECT-ISDN Interworking permits the cooperation of DECT 
mobile units with DECT systems connected to ISDN systems; DECT 
Data Profiles enables data transmission between DECT mobile 
units and DECT systems; DECT Generic Access Profile (GAP), based 
on PAP (Public Access Profile, ETSI Draft TBR 11), defines a 
public standard interface for access from DECT mobile units to 
various fixed networks which take the mobility requirements into 
consideration (probably available after 1995). 
<H5>  Application Areas </H5>
  At home, in small businesses and for the self-employed, 
monocellular cordless telephones and cordless small branch 
exchange facilities based on the DECT standard offer convenience 
and flexibility in the house and garden, in the home office and 
small business, with all the described advantages of mobility 
with excellent communications quality and wiretapping security. 
And this at a price level comparable to significantly simpler 
analog products. Here it is primarily accessibility at all times 
as well as the ability to be able to call at any time and 
everywhere in the house, garden and business sector, without 
charge between persons using internal communication or 
externally via the exchange at normal charges. With the 
available data capability of up to 19.2 kbit/s and with small 
systems as well, interesting solutions are available 
particularly for the home, because it is possible to be in 
contact by computer with voice and data networks from any 
arbitrary place within the range of the system without 
installation of cables and telephone extension units, in 
parallel with other internal and external conversations. 
  In larger organizations which cover a correspondingly larger 
area or space and have their own PBX facility, powerful 
multicellular systems are offered. By means of overlapping radio 
coverage of surface and spatial building structures it is 
possible to assure mobile communications ability, receiving and 
transmitting, fixed and mobile, through continuous localizing of 
the mobile units in the system range (roaming) and automatic, 
interruption-free connection of conversations when changing from 
one cell to another, all the while with a high quality of 
communication. Because of the mobile subscriber's capability for 
active and passive communication, he obtains the advantages 
already mentioned such as rapid reaction capability, faster 
decision-making and increased productivity. In connection with a 
private branch exchange the mobile subscriber gets the 
performance features of the PBS, with the free internal 
communication which is so important particularly for business 
applications and which is also available in mobile form, and the 
external communication at normal charges. 
  In the office sector, data applications are also gaining in 
importance. Here the data capability of DECT by no means 
replaces the high-performance Local Area Networks. DECT's data 
capability of up to 30 kbit/s, initially in the lower speed 
range, covers the important portion, estimated at 80 to 90 
percent, of internal and external data communication at the 
office with a volume of up to 10 kbytes per operation. This 
fully maintains the advantage of being able to transmit speech 
and data at the same time over the same base station. By 
establishing a special data profile (DECT-DATA profile) through 
ETSI, pure data transmission speeds of 1 Mbit/s, in some cases 
also significantly higher combination values, can be achieved. 
  In the public area, above all at special social focal points 
such as pedestrian zones, shopping centers, athletic stadiums, 
airports, railway stations, etc. with a defined area and a high 
traffic density, the DECT is the more suitable solution compared 
to GSM, since with 10,000 Erlang units per square kilometer 
significantly more subscribers can be served (GSM: about 200 
Erlang units per square kilometer). This requires the 
establishment of a minimal common interface for DECT, however, 
which at present is being used under the working name of Generic 
Access Profile/Public Access Profile at ETSI. 
  In the areas covered by the radio technology the DECT 
profile 
GAP/PAP then enables access to PBS systems (and the use of the 
entire range of functions thus provided) as well as public 
analog networks, ISDN and GSM networks through integrated DECT 
subsystems. Since GAP/PAP will become an integral component of 
the DECT standard, it will then be possible, with one and the 
same mobile unit, to communicate via the house base station of 
the cordless DECT telephone or small system or through the 
multicellular DECT office system or via a public base station. 
In connection with the compactness and ease of the DECT mobile 
unit, this sum of possibilities comes very close to the ideal 
picture of a "personal communicator" which everyone can afford, 
which can be carried everywhere and enables you to communicate 
everywhere, at any time and with everyone.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Herr: "Bridge to Broadband ISDN"] </F>
  [Text] Globand is the name of a new network which is now 
available worldwide. It supports transmission speeds of between 
64 kbit/s and 2 Mbit/s and is suitable primarily for undertaking 
services with large quantities of information. One principal 
application will be the videoconference service which Telekom 
will switch from the Transmitted Broadband Network to the 
Globand network at the end of 1993. 
  The starting point for the development of the Globand 
network 
was the European Community's RACE (Research and Development for 
Advanced Communications in Europe) program. Within the framework 
of the European Broadband Interconnection Trial (EBIT) project 
innovative data applications were to be realized, for which a 
suitable data network with a bit rate of at least 2 Mbit/s was 
needed. 
  The EC in 1988 asked the CEPT (Conference Europeenne des 
Administrations des Postes et des Telecommunications) whether it 
was able to supply within a short time such a transparent 
switched data network with the existing technology. As early as 
April 1989 19 Telekom organizations from 14 European countries 
signed a corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). DBP 
Telekom, which was also among the signatories, participated in 
the project with the satellite-supported, area-covering DFS 
network (German Telecommunications Satellite). 
  In the course of the test preparations it turned out, 
however, that only very few applications actually needed 2 
Mbit/s; in most cases 64 kbit/s were enough. The signatories 
therefore decided to halt the Ebit project. Those participants 
who had already made investments for adjustment work and 
calculated their market opportunities signed a new MoU in March 
1992 and together formed a consortium which was given the name 
of GloBanD (Global Bandwidth on Demand). 
  By July 1993 network operators from Finland, Norway, 
Denmark, 
the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Switzerland, Portugal, 
Hong Kong and Australia had joined the consortium. Telekom 
participates as a so-called associate partner, since the 
technology it supplies does not permit full partnership 
according to the MoU. 
<H5>  User Facilities and Applications </H5>
  The Globand network offers the customer the following user 
facilities: 


    -  Switched connections, 
  -  bandwidth on demand 
  -  bit transparent transmission with a speed of n x 64 kbit/s 
(n=1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 23, 24, 30), 
  -  customer interfaces G.703, V11, X.21, Q.931W (planned), 
  -  closed user groups, 
  -  point to multipoint connections, 
  -  reserved connections. 

    This list makes it clear that the Globand network belongs to 
the Corporate Network category. To be sure, some user facilities 
for traffic relations with the German network component are not 
offered for technical reasons: 


    -  Bandwidth on Demand is not available through the 
customer in the DFS network, but is switched on by request by 
the operator; 
  -  at the moment only transmission rates of 384 and 1,920 kbit/s 
are offered; 
  -  no reserved connections; 
  -  no closed user groups. 

    Globand is suitable primarily for the following 
applications: 


    -  Self-dialled videoconferencing including multipoint 
conferencing; 
  -  rapid data transmission, for example between host computers; 
  -  LAN-LAN coupling; 
  -  remote printing and setting; 
  -  back-up for rented lines or overflow traffic; 
  -  audio lines for hifi transmission; 
  -  remote consulting and diagnosis in the medical field; 
  -  CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided 
Manufacturing). 

    The main application of the DFS/Globand network will be the 
videoconference service. At Telekom this service will for 
technical (selection ability) and cost reasons (charge 
standardization) be switched at the end of 1993 from the 
Transmitted Broadband Network (VBN) to the DFS network. 
<H5>  From the DFS Network to the Globand Network </H5>
  The Globand partners are using exclusively terrestrial 
networks. The DFS network, on the other hand, is a 
satellite-supported, digital switched network with transparent 
data channels. It consists of 30 connection stations with the 
transmission-technical installations, two reference stations for 
network internal control purposes and one operating control 
center. 
  The connection stations are operated unmanned and remotely 
serviced and monitored. They consist of the antenna reflector 
with the IF/RF installations (intermediate frequency/radio 
frequency), the TDMA installations (Time Division Multiple 
Access) for allocation of satellite transmission capacity and 
the communications unit (ANPE, adapter unit) for the network 
connection. This consists of 24 2 Mbit/s ports, which if needed 
can be divided into entry and exit ports. The technology is 
based on the S12 system from Alcatel SEL. 
  The communications facilities are in part also terrestrially 
interlinked. This was necessary because of the transfer of the 
videoconferencing service to the DFS network and the resulting 
danger of overloading. For the subscribers this has the 
advantage that they can get a terrestrially routed connection if 
they want to avoid potentially undesirable delay time on the 
satellite link. Moreover, the transition to foreign networks 
also takes place through the communications facility. 
  The network terminus is located at the subscriber's and is 
connected through a 2-Mbit/s connection line to the 
communications facility. The switching procedure takes place 
either software-controlled with a commercial PC or with the 
keyboard of a commercial multifrequency selector telephone. 
  With the exception of the German component, the Diax concept 
is used in the Globand network. This network concept, named 
after the Danish company with the same name, consists of three 
components: 


    -  The local transmission station (Vst) can accept up to 
22 2-Mbit/s connections. It can be operated as a stand-alone Vst 
or as a part of a larger network. 
  -  The Transit-Vst can process up to 80 2 Mbit/s PCM systems and 
supplies the necessary functions of a gateway station. It is 
comparable to the ANPE in the DFS network. 
  -  Dikonet 64 and 2000 form the network terminus for 64 kbit/s 
and 
2 Mbit/s. 

    With junctions to networks with a different technology (such 
as the DFS network), the Transit-Vst must be modified at the 
gateway station in question for the required performance 
characteristics in the entire Globand network. This is done with 
new software releases. 
  The principal difference between the DFS network and the 
infrastructure of the other Globand partners lies in the 
signaling: Both technologies make use of the CCITT-No 7 system, 
with a central time division channel. The Diax technology uses 
the so-called Telephone User Part (TUP) for this, while Telekom 
uses the so-called Data User Part (DUP). 
  The required adaptation functions are in each case 
implemented in the transmission nodes of the gateway stations 
for the immediately adjacent network components. In the case of 
the German network component, this is ANPE. These functions are 
supplied at the stations in Hamburg, Duesseldorf and Offenburg. 
Ultimately, the performance characteristics of the network 
junctions determine all the services offered by the network. 
Thus, the offering of German network components can be expanded 
within Globand if the corresponding modifications are introduced 
into the ANPE of the gateway station and the foreign network 
junction in the immediate vicinity. As an example of this the 
supply of additional transmission speeds (in addition to 384 and 
1,920 kbit/s) is mentioned. 
  A central operating control center for the entire network is 
not necessary. Each network component has its own center 
available, which in addition is equipped with a Globand help 
desk. Operating, monitoring and error elimination are integrated 
into the overall concept of the respective network operator. 
<H5>  Standards for the Competition </H5>
  The international call number in the Globand network 
consists 
either of the Country Code (CC) or the Data Network 
Identification Code (DNIC), including the national portion. Call 
data postprocessing takes place at the operating control center. 
Accounting for the international charges takes place only 
between the directly adjacent network operators and according 
the rules of the telephone service. 
  The quality of services can be specified with respect to the 
connection and the customer service. For network operators who 
support the complete palette of Globand performance 
characteristics, the following examples of values are to be 
understood as standards to be aspired to. 
  Connection parameters: 


    -  Bit error rate: 10&lt;sup&gt; -6&lt;/sup&gt; , 
  -  max. delay time (without satellite): 200 ms, 
  -  connection setup time: 12 seconds, 
  -  lost calls: 0.4 percent. 

    Customer service: 


    -  Installation time for the connection: 90 days, 
  -  length of time for interference suppression: 36 hours, 
  -  manning of the "help desk:" official service hours, 
  -  malfunction reporting: around the clock 

    Telekom regards the DFS network in the Globand network as a 
transitional solution until broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) based on ATM 
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is ready in about three to four 
years. After that, it can be employed as a backup for B-ISDN, if 
necessary. The other Globand partners position their network 
components in the same way. 
  Transmission speeds similar to the Globand network are also 
offered by the narrow band ISDN (S-ISDN). When using inverse 
multiplexers for bundling B channels, for example, the service 
quality of S-ISDN for bit rates over 128 kbit/s will be below 
Globand's, however.

<F P=106> [Report by Takis Kambilis: "Telecommunications Blockade"] </F>
  [Text] For almost two years now, the Turks have been 
planning a telecommunications blockade of Greece from the 
Balkans and also from the geopolitically important region of 
East Europe and the Middle East. 
  Already, three ultramodern fiber optic nets are being built 
by Italy and Turkey for the purpose of linking the European 
Economic Community to the Balkan countries and to the former 
Soviet republics on the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. 
  The central point of these nets, that have major economic 
significance, will be Istanbul. According to the plans, not one 
of these nets will pass through Greece. As experts explain, the 
result will be Greece's being cut off economically from these 
regions--and, in fact, from the Balkans--since it is evident 
that ultramodern telecommunications constitute a prerequisite 
for every form of economic and social development in modern 
societies. 
  More specifically, one of the three nets, that is expected 
to 
be put into service in about a year, will link Bari, Italy, with 
Tirana, Skopje, Sofia and Istanbul, leaving Greece completely 
out of the planning. 
  Prof. Kostas Makropoulos, former OTE [Greek 
Telecommunications Organization] and community specialist on 
telecommunications issues, was the one who revealed the details 
of the plan and the dangers posed for Greece from a 
telecommunications blockade. He attributed responsibility to the 
previous government since the agreements involved were signed in 
December 1992 and the technical projects inaugurated in May 1993. 
  Mr. Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement] secretary general, has already been informed on the 
matter, while a relevant file will probably be given to Minister 
of National Defense Yerasimos Arsenis today. 
<H5>  The Plans </H5>
  Specifically, from the relevant documents and maps, it 
appears that on 2 December 1992 contracts were signed for the 
implementation of the three plans to set up a telecommunications 
infrastructure lasting 25 years. The ITUR links Italy with 
Turkey and Ukraine with Russia. This net starts out in Palermo, 
goes to Istanbul and from there, via Ankara, heads for Odessa 
(and Novorossiisk, Russia). Its length is 3,500 kilometers, 
while it is expected to go into service at the end of 1995. The 
technical meeting took place on 25-28 May 1993 and the second 
that took place a month ago concerned the building of five pairs 
of fiber optics at 565 MB/sec with 38,400 circuits. 
  The second plan that is called DOKAR concerns the linking of 
Istanbul and Ankara with the eastern shores of the Black Sea. 
Its two other big stations are Tbilisi and Baku.It also has the 
same huge capacity of 565 MB that, however, abruptly drops to 34 
MB when the net reaches Georgia. It has been planned to go into 
operation sometime in 1994. 
  The third (and best) net is the Trans-Balkan Link. It begins 
in Bari and goes to Durres, Tirana, Skopje, Sofia, Sliven and 
Istanbul that is the central city station for all three nets. 
The relevant agreement was signed five months later, on 6 May 
1993. We have here 1,920 140 MB circuits and 7,650 622 MB 
circuits. Beginning of service is also planned for sometime in 
1994. 
  Finally, there are also plans for linking the Black Sea 
shores that include Romania. 
<H5>  Northern Cyprus </H5>
  Besides the Balkan telecommunications arc that is being 
promoted, the Turks have also included another fiber optic net 
that will link up with Turkish-held northern Cyprus. 
  As Mr. Makropoulos explained, the Turkish plan constitutes 
one of the most developed forms of an exercise of political and 
economic pressure that is founded on the development of new 
technologies. The country that will constitute the central 
telecommunications junction of a major geographic region not 
only will earn billions of dollars from the use of this net by 
third parties but it will automatically acquire a privileged 
entry into the countries that will be linked with Europe. 
  Mr. Makropoulos further explained, "Fiber optics today 
constitute the linchpin of the community's telecommunications 
policy for the coming decades. This is so because they are much 
cheaper than satellites and have much greater capacities. In 
other words, they are able to send to another given region 
images, sound and information in the shortest possible time. I 
will cite as an example that a 140 MB net can send information 
on 7,500 typed pages in the space of one second!" 
  As Mr. Makropoulos said, all the added value services are 
based on these nets as are the rapid development of activities 
such as tourism, trade, technical projects, cultural relations 
and, finally, privileged entry of a given country into third 
countries since the latter depend on--in this case--Turkey. 
  The cost of the investment is big but for this too, 
according 
to Mr. Makropoulos, there is expectation for community subsidies! 
  Mr. Makropoulos added, "Unfortunately, these facts reveal 
how 
the New Democracy party exercised such an unrealistic and 
nationally dangerous policy in a field like telecommunications."

<F P=106> [Article: "New EC Proposal on HDTV Transmission Standards"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels--The European Commission [EC] is going to 
propose a new directive (Europe-wide law) on high-definition 
television (HDTV) to promote popularization of wide-format 
television (16/9 width-height ratio) that will be applicable 
independent of the transmission standard used, according to 
Community sources. 
  This new proposal follows the Twelve's decision last June to 
promote wide-screen television in the HDTV action program and 
abandon any reference to a single, mandatory transmission 
standard. Initially, the Commission had planned to make the 
D2-MAC and High Definition-MAC (HD-MAC) standards obligatory. 
  The new proposal, to be submitted to member states on 7 
December, provides that television services transmitted to 
viewers by cable, satellite, or ground-based broadcasting 
stations must utilize either D2-MAC or a transmission system 100 
percent compatible with PAL or SECAM standards. Among other 
things, that should permit use of the German "PAL Plus" standard 
now under development. 
  For services not fully digitized, the Commission proposal 
endorses the HD-MAC transmission system. Experts expect digital 
transmission standards to evolve rapidly in the coming years. 
The Commission stipulates however that digital transmission 
systems will have to be "standardized by a European 
standardization body." 
  The proposed directive also says that "any wide-format 
(16/9) 
television service that is picked up and rebroadcast by cable 
systems must be rebroadcast in the wide (16/9) format."

<F P=106> [Article by Ulrike Scholz: "The Aura of Elegance"] </F>
  [Text] The development of telecommunications has been a 
success story in eastern Germany. The second privately operated 
mobile communications system is scheduled to go into operation 
in early 1994. The system will be operated in the Berlin and 
Leipzig regions. 
  Herbert Brenke complains that "whenever E-Plus looks for 
sites for its transmitters, it finds that D1 and D2 have already 
been there." The managing director of E-Plus Mobilfunk, the 
third largest mobile communications company, knew as early as 
April 1993 what lay in store for him. He would have to try to 
operate in the same market that his competitors Telekom and 
Mannesmann had entered two years earlier. 
  The launching of the new system is to be in eastern Germany, 
where the need to catch up in the communications field is still 
great. The inauguration of services in Berlin and Leipzig 
simultaneously signals the rapidity with which the networks 
between Ruegen and the Thuringian Forest will be connected up. 
  Since unification, Telekom has accomplished an incomparable 
feat in East Germany. In its "Telekom 2000 Program," this 
government-operated company set forth the schedule according to 
which the state-of-the-art of communications in the new federal 
states was to be brought up to the level existing in West 
Germany. 
  Telekom is already way ahead of its own schedule. It will 
conclude work on the digital communications system this year. In 
the first half of 1993 alone, 540,000 customers in eastern 
Germany were provided with telephone service, i.e., 53&percnt; 
more 
than in the entire previous year. Some 3,500 public telephones 
were installed this year, mostly in rural areas; 12,000 phones 
had to be replaced, 5,000 of which were inoperable. 
  The rapid tempo was made possible by the expeditious 
installation of most of the digital trunk node exchanges and the 
500 local digital exchanges. Every second local network was 
substantially expanded and modernized. In late September, 
Quedlinburg and Gera became the first cities in the world to 
have a fiber-glass system in operation. 
  "These are the kind of accomplishments that bring the 
company 
considerable favorable recognition from abroad," Dr. Wilhelm 
Paellmann, Telekom board member, said. With its 11 billion 
German marks [DM] invested, Telekom is the greatest single 
investor in the new federal states this year. 
  A considerable volume of the tasks in data and mobile 
communications has already been resolved. Telekom established 
its mobile communications sector this summer. The 100&percnt; 
subsidiary is called "DeTeMobil." It is designed to make 
D1-system users more flexible. D1 has at least 315,000 customers 
in Germany. However, neither the subsidiary nor the parent 
company enjoys the profits, since all proceeds go into the 
common Post Office pot. Nonetheless, Brenke, the head of E-Plus, 
has to reckon with both governmental as well as private mobile 
communications competition. He has to operate with another 
handicap as well. While the D-systems operate in the Global 
System for Mobile Communications Standard at 900 mHz, the E-Plus 
system is designed for a frequency range of 1.8 GHz. It 
transmits and receives in the Standard DCS 1800 (Digital 
Personal Communication System). However, given the same 
transmitting power, the range of the higher frequencies is less. 
Consequently, a transmitting and receiving station in the 
E-system can only service a smaller area than one in the 
D-system. 
  In its final expansion, E-Plus will have 4,000 to 6,000 
cells 
in Germany. Even Brenke doesn't know the final number yet. It 
depends on the locations of the base stations. In large cities, 
the radius of operation is between one and three kilometers, 
while in a flat landscape it can be up to 20 kilometers. 
  Brenke's wish is for infrastructure-sharing: "We would 
gladly 
share transmitting masts and other facilities with our 
competitors." Unfortunately, the market is a battle field. The 
head of E-Plus is now hoping for a developmental breakthrough in 
the matter of base stations and mobile telephones. He expects 
smaller, lighter, and more powerful equipment and facilities so 
that he would not have to incur the same expenditures as his two 
competitors. 
  Brenke knows that there are also certain advantages when one 
enters the market later. Potential customers have already 
accepted mobile communications. In addition, the technology has 
already matured and been perfected and can be procured at 
cheaper rates. In late October, ESCOM offered Motorola's 
International-3200 Handy along with the D2-card for a measly 
DM389. This offer could drive the second million mobile 
communications customers, who have been waiting for digital 
systems and cheaper equipment, into the open arms of E-Plus 
Mobilfunk GmbH. 
  But even this order of magnitude does not satisfy the 
ambitious Herr Brenke at all. In the year 2000, ten million 
customers will be using mobile communications systems in 
Germany. Brenke will have a large part of them. His marketing 
strategy is to open up new layers of buyers. "Mobile 
communications must assume the certain aura of elegance. If they 
are to be considered affordable, the potential private customers 
will have to be convinced that the mobile telephone will create 
new possibilities and a greater degree of personal freedom."

<F P=106> [Article by Ricardo Galuppo: "Through a Glass Wire"; </F>
introductory paragraph in italics as published] 
  [Text] After a delay of 15 years, Brazil is seriously 
entering the era of fiber-optic communications. 
  A radical change in the panorama of Brazilian 
telecommunications has begun almost without being noticed. Since 
last month, two optical-fiber cables installed along the 450-km 
Dutra Highway have been carrying telephone calls between Sao 
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Each cable is as thick as the neck of 
a beer bottle. In it are the optical fibers--thin glass wires 
with the diameter of a strand of hair. The new system was 
designed to carry 124,000 telephone conversations 
simultaneously, thus quadrupling the capacity for connections 
between the two cities. Fifteen years behind the developed 
countries, Brazil has entered the era of long-distance data, 
sound, and image transmission using the optical system, which is 
100 times faster than copper cables and has a useful life twice 
that of a satellite. "If Brazil had waited a little longer to 
invest in fiber optics, it would have found it difficult to talk 
to the rest of the world by the turn of the century," says Eng. 
Walter de Andrade Carvalho, a respected consultant in Sao Paulo. 
  Fiber optics is a system for transmitting information by 
means of light signals that began to spread around the world in 
the late 1970's. Three undersea cable systems are going to link 
Japan with the West Coast of the United States, and three more 
will connect the East Coast of the United States with Europe. 
U.S. President Bill Clinton recently announced the adoption of a 
plan--called the fiber optics superhighway--to link the chief 
cities of the United States. Brazil is leagues behind, but the 
reason for the nation's backwardness in this area is easy to 
understand. 
  For many years, optical fibers were included in the package 
of over 100 items whose importation was banned by Brazilian law, 
and domestic manufacturers were protected by the market reserve 
established for information technology. For years, Brazilian 
government-owned telecommunications companies could buy only 
fibers produced at the ABC Xtal factory in Campinas. Not even 
Italian-owned Pirelli, which had started producing fibers in 
Brazil before the market reserve was established, was allowed to 
bid for government contracts. "We manufactured the fibers here 
and had to sell them in countries such as Uruguay and Bolivia. 
Fortunately, that time has passed," says Eng. Ludgero Patarro, 
director of Pirelli's telecommunications division. Working in 
partnership with Japan's NEC, which developed the project, 
Pirelli produced the cables linking Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. 
  Optical-fiber triangle: Until last month's inauguration, 
most 
of the optical-fiber lines existing in Brazil were urban. They 
linked stations owned by Embratel, Brazil's government-owned 
telecommunications company, and located within the same city. 
There was also a medium-distance line between Sao Paulo and 
Campinas that had been installed by Telesp, the Sao Paulo 
telephone company, a few years before. That picture is changing 
quickly. Next year an optical-fiber triangle linking Sao Paulo, 
Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte will be in operation. To 
complete the two missing sides of the triangle--the links 
between Belo Horizonte and the two other cities--over 1,000 km 
of cable will be installed. That stage of the project will cost 
about $100 million. 
  Last week Embratel began examining competitive bids for the 
installation of two other lines. The first will link the town of 
Sao Mateus in Espirito Santo with Porto Seguro in Bahia. The 
other will link Natal and Fortaleza. Those two sections 
constitute the land component of a much more ambitious plan. 
They will be interconnected by a system of undersea cables. 
Scheduled for completion by the end of 1995 is the Brazilian 
portion of a project that will link South America with the rest 
of the world through fiber optics. The entire domestic network 
is expected to cost $1.4 billion. 
  The only advantage Brazil gains by getting a late start with 
fiber optics is that it will pay less for its lines. Technology 
has evolved in recent years, and the fibers are better and less 
expensive today than they were a decade ago. Ten years ago, it 
cost exactly $1 to produce one meter of optical fiber. Now the 
developed countries can produce one meter of fiber for $0.07. It 
costs Brazilian manufacturers such as ABC Xtal, Pirelli, and 
Abracel slightly more than that: from $0.10 to $0.11 per meter. 
At present, any foreign company can participate in competitive 
bidding in Brazil. The cost of installing a optical-fiber line 
is relatively low compared to that of a conventional telephone 
line. 
  Ipanema and Copacabana: A few years ago, the National 
Highway 
Department (DNER) installed a system of conduits along the Dutra 
Highway. Those conduits carried the copper cables for the DNER's 
internal communications system between Sao Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro. To install the optical-fiber line, the only thing 
necessary was to draw the new cables through those conduits and 
set up eight automatic relay stations along the way. The relay 
stations amplify the signals and make it possible for someone in 
Ipanema to hear the voice of a friend in Sao Paulo more clearly 
than he would hear a call from Copacabana, an adjoining 
neighborhood. In future links, the government-owned firm will 
lay cables one meter deep alongside federal highways and 
railroads. It will not be necessary to spend money to 
expropriate land or to build complex civil engineering 
structures. 
  "Optical fibers do not replace all communication methods, 
but 
they are unbeatable in the things that they can do better," says 
Eng. Gilberto Viana, head of Embratel's Land Communications 
Department. Satellites are still irreplaceable when it comes to 
communicating with remote areas such as the Amazon Region. The 
cost of installing and maintaining an optical-fiber cable 
through the jungle would be very high in relation to the 
benefits provided by such a system. Most long-distance telephone 
connections and all international connections in Brazil are 
handled by the satellite communication system. When the entire 
system is in place, 75 percent of the traffic will be carried by 
the fiber optics system. 
  Business opportunities: The Brazilian subsidiary of the U.S. 
telecommunications company AT&amp;T estimates that on the day 
when 
the system is completely installed, Brazil will be able to 
double the number of telephone lines with a quality of service 
superior to that existing now. The country currently has about 
12 million lines, and only seven out of every 12 Brazilians have 
a telephone. That is one of the lowest averages in South 
America. Besides helping to improve that score, fiber optics 
will help open up the possibilities for new technologies such as 
interactive television and multimedia services, which are 
already being introduced in American homes by means of fibers. 
"Thanks to fiber optics, telephone lines are no longer limited 
exclusively to telephone calls; instead, they are starting to be 
used to transmit a number of different signals," says Adley 
Alves Pereira of Brazilian AT&amp;T. "They are becoming a two-way 
channel through which the user can interact with the person 
sending him the signals." 
  The same optical-fiber line can carry telephone calls, TV 
pictures, and alarm systems simultaneously. The system also 
carries messages exchanged between computers located kilometers 
apart. The installation of those services alone should generate 
business opportunities estimated to be worth over $1.5 billion 
annually in the field of connections and new systems. In the 
United States, all those services are within reach of most of 
the population. Out of every group of 100 Americans, 60 receive 
cable TV signals in their homes by way of optical fibers. In 
Brazil, most of the existing cable TV services use their own 
networks linked by copper cables. 
  Linking the big cities is the first step in bringing the 
convenience already enjoyed by Americans closer to Brazilians. 
After that, it will be necessary to adapt the urban networks to 
the new system. The amount of money required is tremendous, and 
it is unlikely that the government-owned system will be able to 
finance the whole undertaking alone. A number of alternative 
solutions are being considered, but implementing them will 
require changes in the Constitution. "The speed at which the 
country is incorporated into this system will have to be much 
faster than it is now. Embratel and the telecommunications 
companies owned by the states cannot afford to improve service 
at the pace required by Brazil," says Eng. Raul Del Fiol, a 
telecommunications expert at Promon Engineering. Embratel wanted 
to invest a total of $4.6 billion this year, but the government 
ordered a 25-percent cut in the company's budget. "If the law 
did not prohibit it, private enterprise would have covered the 
difference and also invested a lot more money in the country," 
says Del Fiol.

<F P=106> [Article signed S.D.: "Computer-Aided Design: JESSI </F>
Program Produces Tangible Results"] 
  [Text] Many computer-aided design (CAD) tools developed 
within the scope of the Joint European Submicron Silicon 
Initiative (JESSI) are already being commercialized, mostly by 
European companies. 
  During the presentation of JESSI's mid-term results at the 
"Componic" fair, J.-P. Tual (Bull) provided a status report of 
the electronic CAD subprogram. "All targets have been met," he 
concluded, stressing that JESSI-developed CAD tools "have 
reached industrial quality and are actually being 
commercialized." 
  The CAD subprogram has four major goals: To develop CAD 
tools for specific applications which meet industry's 
requirements and for which no commercial systems are available; 
to foster the development of a European CAD industry by 
strengthening the (scarce) existing potential and by developing 
new market segments; to supply methods and tools for libraries 
development and modeling; and to promote the use of standards 
(VHDL [very-high-speed hardware description language], EDIF 
[Electronic Data Interchange Format], Frameworks) and European 
participation in standards development. The CAD subprogram 
operates according to the following major principles: no exotic 
tools, but tools that are compatible with commercially available 
ones; libraries that can be used for the development of various 
CAD systems; and the effective dissemination of tools developed 
under the program. With this, Tual emphasized, European 
manufacturers seek to counter "the U.S. tools syndrome, 
according to which only the Americans produce good tools." 
<H5>  Some 20 `Major' Tools Already on the Market </H5>
  Further expanding on the results to date, Tual mentioned CAD 
tools developed for specific telecommunications applications, 
some of which are being commercialized by the companies 
Racal-Redac (card design tools) and by Anacad (mixed 
analog-digital design tools). In the area of automotive 
applications, he mentioned the commercialization of retiming 
tools by Philips and of a synthesis tool for field-programmable 
gate arrays (FPGA) by the Grenoble company Innovative Synthesis 
Technologies. Various JESSI-developed tools are also being 
marketed by other companies, including SNI [Siemens Nixdorf] and 
the French Aster Ingenierie [Aster Engineering] company, which 
is offering a testing tool obtained through a technology 
transfer from Bull. Another Bull technology (a formal testing 
tool) is being marketed via a partnership with the U.S. company 
Compass. Mentor/EDC, another U.S. company, is marketing a DSP 
(digital signal processor) developed under JESSI. Tual stressed 
that the industrialization and commercialization of 
JESSI-developed CAD tools is expected to gain even more momentum 
during the second half of the program, which will be completed 
in late 1996.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Three European Orders For Cray's </F>
MPP"] 
  [Excerpts] After a slow (or late) start Cray Research 
entered the massively parallel processing [MPP] area with its 
T3D system. According to Cray officials, the T3D must lead the 
company to MPP market leadership within one year. First orders 
include Switzerland, France and the United Kingdom. [passage 
omitted, describing Cray T3D features.] 
<H5>  Performance </H5>
  On some tests, the 128-processor T3D system was as much as 
four times faster than all other MPP products with up to 128 
processors, Steve Nelson, head of Cray's T3D development program 
said; and continued that in these tests, and in operation at 
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), the Cray T3D system 
demonstrated latency of under one microsecond. Latency -- the 
time it takes for a processor to begin using data it has 
requested -- is key to overall MPP system performance and 
ease-of-programming, "current leading MPP vendors are in the 
100-microsecond latency range, and are targeting the 
tens-of-microseconds range in the next two years," Nelson said. 
"For this key performance indicator, the Cray T3D system is 
typically two orders-of-magnitude ahead of current leading MPP 
products." 
<H5>  Installations </H5>
  PSC has installed and accepted a 32-processor T3D prototype 
scheduled to grow in early 1994 to a 512-processor production 
system. Other early customers are NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology EPFL 
(Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne) which has signed a 
preliminary agreement to acquire a 256-processor system in early 
1994. These three customers will collaborate under Cray's 
Parallel Applications Technology Program (PATP), to develop 
targeted software applications for the T3D system. 
  Further European customers are the European Centre for 
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the French Atomic 
Energy Commission, Commissariat a L'Energie Atomique (CEA). 
  ECMWF ordered a Cray T3D MCA64-8, a 64-processor, air-cooled 
system. The T3D will be closely coupled with a Cray Y-MP2E 
system also ordered by ECMWF. Both systems are scheduled to be 
installed at the Centre's Reading, England, headquarters in 
mid-1994. ECMWF will use the T3D to develop new forecasting 
models that take advantage of MPP technology, and also to run 
the Centre's ensemble prediction package, used to generate 
forecasts provided to 18 national weather services throughout 
Europe. In Ensemble forecasting, meteorologists run multiple 
versions of a forecasting model, varying the data describing the 
initial weather conditions with each run. This 
computation-intensive technique is used to improve the accuracy 
of forecasts by determining their sensitivity to variations in 
initial weather conditions. 
  The CEA Division des Applications Militaires [Military 
Applications Division] ordered a Cray T3D MC128-2, a 
128-processor system that will be coupled with a Cray M92 system 
that is already on site. The system is scheduled to be 
installed in the fourth quarter of 1993 at CEA's Centre d'Etudes 
de Limeil-Valenton [Limeil-Valenton Study Center], near Paris. 
The French will use the T3D for research in fundamental and 
laser physics, and for electrodynamic and aerodynamic studies.

  [Text] "I am pleased to have a new house." Lucie is a 
tetraplegic child, incapable of correct speech, but she was able 
to "type" this sentence on a computer in just a few seconds -- 
simply by looking at it. This moving demonstration is the fruit 
of the work of Jacques Charlier, an optical engineer and 
researcher at the National Health and Medical Research Institute 
(INSERM) in Lille, on an eye-controlled system. The device, 
which can be adapted for use with any microcomputer, includes a 
sensor that measures line of sight and an assignment table 
containing the alphabet and a few word processing function 
symbols. The sensor, placed behind the assignment table, scans 
eye movement through a central orifice. A method for processing 
the eye image, based on an identification of specific pupil 
shapes and the corneal reflection, makes it possible to overcome 
artefacts such as parasitic reflections. Charlier explains: 
"Data can be entered at the rate of one to two characters per 
second. The control principle is not specific to computers -- 
household appliances can also be controlled in this way." This 
system, with the backing of the Delta 7 humanitarian society, 
should benefit several hundreds or even thousands of severely 
handicapped people in France. Unfortunately, the system -- 
costing around 100,000 French francs -- will not go on sale for 
another two to three years, giving home reeducation centers time 
to evaluate and perfect the system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bayer To Order Cray C92"] </F>
  [Text] In contrast to United States chemical companies, 
European chemical/pharmaceutical firms do not buy or use very 
much high-end computing equipment. For a long time, the German 
company Schering was the only one with a Siemens/Fujitsu machine 
in its Berlin Lab. Now Bayer AG (also German) has ordered a 
computer from Cray Research. A two-processor, air-cooled Cray 
C92A system featuring very large DRAM memory capacity is 
scheduled to be installed in first-quarter 1994 in Bayer's 
Central Research Facility in Leverkusen, Germany. Terms were 
not disclosed. 
  Bayer is global player in the chemical industry. In Germany 
they are producing at five different sites, but they are also 
producing in Japan, they have a big affiliated company in the 
United States of America, and they will invest more than ECU150 
million in China, Bayer plans to use the new system to solve 
large, computationally intensive problems in process simulation 
-- such as planning and laying out of production facilities -- 
and to optimise plant operations for safety, environmental 
factors and cost-effectiveness. 
  Virtually all supercomputer producers were competing for the 
business and Bayer's decision followed extensive benchmark 
testing, said Wolfram Wagner, director of technology resources 
in the Central Research Facility. These test runs showed that 
by simulating complex processes, Bayer would be able to reduce 
costs and time in process development and gain a clear 
competitive advantage, by optimising plant operations worldwide. 
  "The Cray system, in conjunction with high-performance 
software, will open a new dimension in process development for 
us," he said. "Process simulation means designing the production 
facility on the computer system, optimising it dynamically, and 
speeding up its operations. It seems that we can reduce the 
production costs with more than 10 percent." 
  Bayer and Cray Research also have agreed to collaborate 
extensively on developing and optimising computer-aided steady 
state and dynamic plant simulation. The focal points of the 
collaboration are: 
  -- Analysis and performance optimisation of plant simulation 
software; 
  -- Optimisation of application software, through the 
introduction and testing of specialised software tools; 
  -- Development and testing of new computer-aided methods for 
simulating complex chemical plants on the T3D, Cray's parallel 
system; 
  -- Porting and optimisation of applications software on 
multiprocessor systems, in collaboration with Cray Research and 
established software vendors; 
  -- Testing of parallel computers for the use of this 
application software on real production problems.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Two Cray Sparc Superservers for </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] Cray Research Superservers announced a new 
superserver product line. The new CS6400 systems are available 
with four to 64 Sparc processors and have a United States list 
price beginning at under ECU350,000. In Europe, two sales have 
already been announced. 
  In Europe, there are already two announced sales. The 
research division of Electricite de France (EDF), the world's 
largest electrical utility, based in Clamart, will be an early 
customer. A 16-processor system with two Gbytes of central 
memory will be shipped during November and the system will be 
upgraded to 32 processors and four Gbytes of memory in 1994. 
Terms were not disclosed. 
  EDF, a long-time Cray Research customer, has plans to use 
the 
CS6400 for scientific, engineering and data management 
applications serving users of EDF's extensive computer network. 
  "We will use the Cray Superserver 6400 system to provide 
enterprise level general computing services to various 
organisations within EDF," said Michel Pavard, head of EDF's 
data processing and applied mathematics unit. "We were looking 
for a high-performance Unix server to support a variety of 
applications and a large number of users, and the Cray 
Superserver 6400 system was our choice. With its data centre 
capabilities, scalability and excellent price/performance the 
system fits nicely into our existing network." 
  The German electronics firm SICAN has also ordered a CS6400 
system. 
  The German electronics firm SICAN, based in Hannover, has 
also ordered, and is scheduled to receive, a CS6400 system in 
the first quarter of 1994. SICAN will initially receive a 
20-processor system that will be upgraded later in 1994 to a 
48-processor system. Again, terms were not disclosed. 
  SICAN provides design services for German and United States 
based industries that use Applications Specific Integrate 
Circuits (ASICS) and full custom designs. The CS6400 system 
will be used for highly scalar Electronic Computer-Aided Design 
(ECAD) applications, as well as for data management. 
  "We are targeting the CS6400 for a number of electronic 
design codes including commercially available programs and those 
we've developed in-house," said Hans Weinerth, chairman and CEO 
for SICAN. "The CS6400 is an outstanding option for us since 
most of our codes now run on our more than 50 Sun systems. We 
know that these same codes will run without recompilation on the 
CS6400, which will provide a central, powerful and 
cost-effective resource for our many desktop Sun users. In 
effect, the CS6400 allows us to upgrade each of our workstations 
with one single purchase."

<F P=106> [Article by Arnold Noeldechen: "Research Priorities: GMD </F>
Wants to Push Neural Information Development in the Federal 
Republic--Nanoelectronics is Also Moving Ahead--Light Pulses 
Control a Transistor Made of Organic Molecules"] 
  [Text] Neural information science plays an important role 
in Germany for the development of new image evaluation systems 
including medicine and robot systems. Neural information science 
will also become important for future telecommunication systems, 
as Dr. Christoph von der Malsburg (Ruhr-University Bochum) 
pointed out at a seminar of the Society for Mathematics and Data 
Processing (GMD) at Birlinghoven Castle (53757 Sankt Augustin). 
  According to Professor von der Malsburg, the development of 
neural information science constitutes a switch from Boolean 
logic to an "algorithmic world" to control self-organizing 
systems. Neural information science tries to use the brain's 
data processing functions for technical communication 
processes--a field which GMD wants to emphasize in the future. 
  An interesting practical application is an image processing 
system which is able to recognize persons on photos, even when 
the photos have been disguised or when they were taken under 
different illumi nation or viewing angles. For recognition, such 
a photo is covered with a coarse grid and the image content of 
each grid cell is defined by an algorithm. 
  The system is based on a mathematical formula which 
describes 
how small, spatially arranged waves are changed by a 
perpendicular sine wave. This allows the mathematical 
determination of the image content of all grid cells. 
  Pictures which were distorted by rotation or other means can 
be quickly compared with the original photo using the distorted 
grid and the previously defined image content, so that the 
identity can be established even from distorted pictures. The 
system can be used for checking personal identities and 
signatures. 
  However, it is also suitable for highly automated measuring 
systems to avoid rear-end collisions. With this system, robots 
can "recognize" and sort out individual parts, even if they are 
scattered around randomly. Another possible application is the 
automatic sorting of waste which would be very beneficial from 
an ecological point of view since manual sorting does not make 
sense because of the high labor cost and slow sorting speed. 
  In addition to neural information science, GMD is pushing 
ahead with numerous research projects for the integration of 
computer hardware to avoid falling behind the United States or 
Japan on an international level. Dr. Gerhard Abstreiter, a 
professor at the Walter-Schottky-Institute of the Technical 
University Munich, claims that continued development of 
microelectronics towards "nanoelectronics" with its even finer 
structures will not be restricted by physical and technical 
limitations in the next 20 years. 
  He says that the necessary manufacturing techniques will not 
require a completely new technology, but can be accomplished 
with advanced processes which are already being used today. They 
are sufficient for layer thicknesses around five Angstrom and 
for producing structures around 60 nanometers. 
  Such ultra large-scale (ULSI) circuits would have to take 
into account quantum-mechanical effects. Research of his 
institute in this field has already resulted in novel quantum 
devices, and it is possible to produce n-type transistors for 
functional logic circuits in the nanometer range. 
  According to Dr. Manfred Pilkuhn (Physical Institute of the 
University Stuttgart) the continued integration beyond the 
nanometer range towards the molecule and atom range will require 
the use of biological reactions in order to implement molecular 
circuits measuring only a few nanometers. This includes, for 
instance, the principle underlying photosynthesis, i.e. the 
controlled transfer of a charge under light. 
  The physicists in Stuttgart have presented a molecular 
transistor which consists only of organic molecules and where 
the transfer of the charge can be controlled by light pulses. A 
combination of fulgides called a switching molecule can "block" 
the transfer of a charge using ultraviolet light. The transfer 
is made possible again by light in the visible spectrum. 
Naphtacyanines in a polyethylene matrix receive and store the 
transmitted charge. This molecular switch was supported and 
developed in Stuttgart as part of special research program 329. 
  With the minute size of these structures around ten 
nanometers, such switch structures can also be used as data 
storage for binary information with the potential for memory 
densities similar to those of the human brain. 
  As Professor Pilkhun's experiments have shown, the required 
printed circuits in the molecular range can be produced quite 
easily using long molecular chains consisting of polythiophenes, 
for instance. Since the photolithographic process cannot be used 
in the molecular range, the researchers will attempt to replace 
it with application techniques using the Langmuir-Blodgett 
process. However, Pilkuhn admits that it is not easy to build up 
the desired structures in this manner. 
  Another unresolved problem is the attachment of molecular 
circuits to circuits using nano- or microelectronics. Pilkuhn 
thinks it is possible to work with optical controls using 
semiconductor lasers instead of the conventional electrical 
connections. Experiments in this area are underway at the 
University of Stuttgart. 
  One can only hope that the GND will have more success with 
its research projects in neural information science and advanced 
electronics than with the development of parallel computers. 
Some observers think that the Suprenum project could have given 
German industry a considerable edge if they had succeeded to 
develop the related software in time. However, the public should 
also be informed about the economic success, the so-called 
spin-off, so that the general public understands that research 
in Germany pays off. 
  According to the Federal Ministry for Research, GMD's head 
organization, this year DM1.5 billion will be available for 
research in information science with DM 1.04 million coming from 
the budget of the Federal Ministry for Research. Private 
industry, however, finances about 95 percent of the research 
itself and thus manages almost completely without government 
support. On the other hand, the Federal Ministry for Research 
supports nearly all research institutions, universities, and 
research associations employing about 3,000 scientists.

<H3>  Systems Forum: What is the Data Security Situation in 
Germany? </H3>
<H5>  Experts Criticize a Lack of Awareness of the Problem. </H5>
  In Germany, there is a lack of awareness of the problem of 
data security. This was the conclusion of a panel discussion on 
the occasion of the Systems Computer Fair in Munich. The group 
of experts were unanimous primarily in saying that there cannot 
be complete security against data theft. 
  The title of the panel discussion on the occasion of the 
Systems Fair was chosen to be provocative: "The absolute 
worst-case scenario caused by data theft." The discussion lasted 
about one hour. However, there was quick evidence that the 
problem of data security in German government offices and 
companies cannot be given high enough importance. This is 
because our entire society is dependent to a large extent on the 
availability of advanced information technology. That is 
precisely the problem, said Prof. Klaus Brunnstein from the 
University of Hamburg. "We need this technology but it cannot be 
made 100 percent secure." 
  With the increasing complexity of data processing solutions 
and the trend toward variegated services, the effects of 
breakdowns in the technology become more and more painful. This 
involves not only the theft of important data but also simple 
breakdowns of hardware and software. According to Brunnstein, 
"Hardware errors make up a greater percentage of the problems in 
EDP than we generally believe." The famous viruses account for a 
maximum of 25&percnt; of such problems. 
  Regarding data theft, the scientist from Hamburg sees the 
greatest risk potential in system administrators. These are the 
individuals responsible for managing EDP systems in companies 
and government offices. In their role as experts, the systems 
administrators are usually only poorly monitored and could thus 
easily access all important data. 
  Peter Schikora is the director of the FastComtec company. He 
sees the absolute worst-case scenario for information technology 
happening in the near future. He cites reports which see the 
Telekom division of the Federal Post Office suffering damages to 
the extent of 20 million Deutsche marks per week through the 
manipulations of hackers. In industry, data on research and 
development projects worth millions are passed back and forth 
over virtually unsecured data lines while appropriate security 
measures would only cost about 150,000 Deutsche marks. "However, 
data protection is obviously too expensive," according to 
Schikora, "primarily because the original copy of the stolen 
data is still available even after the theft." 
  To tackle the problem, management also needs to be 
sensitized. Prof. Alfred Bullesbach is the data protection 
officer at Debis, a subsidiary of Daimler Benz. He says, "Data 
protection is a management task." In the final analysis, if the 
available information technology is to be used, the appropriate 
awareness for the dangers and strategies to defend against these 
dangers must be developed. 
  The virus expert from Hamburg, Brunnstein, also sees a 
considerable lack of information on the part of the police and 
the criminal prosecution authorities. Very few policemen, 
judges, or prosecutors are capable of properly evaluating and 
classifying criminal offenses in conjunction with EDP systems. 
Appropriate training is urgently needed in this area. 
  Brunnstein also sees another problem. "Our companies invest 
about two to five percent of their DP budgets in data security. 
However, this investment is usually directed toward the central 
computer and only rarely toward the PC networks in the company." 
However, it is precisely these networks that face the greatest 
danger. 
  Brunnstein classifies computers into three categories. The 
first category is "inflexible but secure." These are computers 
that, for example, also permit monitoring of the administrator 
and therefore provide a high degree of security. The second 
category is flexible but not secure. In Brunnstein's opinion, 
this category includes all PCs running under the operating 
systems MS- DOS ("Not an operating system, but free housekeeping 
software," says Brunnstein.), Mac-OS and Unix. Brunnstein puts 
the newer systems of Windows NT, OS/2 and the most recent 
network systems into a third category. These systems have good 
approaches to security but they have not been proven in actual 
practice.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Computer Program to Assist in Oil, </F>
Gas Exploration--Process in Berlin Evaluates Gravity Field and 
Magnetic Field Interferences"] 
  [Text] The search for crude oil and natural gas deposits is 
primarily based on seismic measurements which is a rather costly 
process. However, another possibility is the evaluation of 
gravimetric and magnetic fields which supposedly can be measured 
quickly and inexpensively. Now, a software system called Igmas 
which was developed at the Free University of Berl in (Dr. 
Hans-Juergen Goetze, Institut fuer Geologie, Malteserstr. 
74-100, 12249 Berlin) allows the three-dimensional interactive 
evaluation of these measurements. 
  As Professor Goetze explains, the gravity and magnetic 
fields 
are changed by anomalies in the geological structure. 
Identification of these anomalies using high-resolution 
measuring instruments is relatively quick and simple so that 
these anomalies can be used for the exploration of deposits. 
However, complex calculations are required to relate the local 
geological formations to the measured anomalies. 
  These types of calculations require an enormous amount of 
computing time. Therefore, it was not possible until now to 
obtain a clear picture of the geological conditions based on the 
anomalies of the local gravity or magnetic fields. So far, such 
evaluations were used only to confirm the results of seismic 
methods. 
  According to Goetz, Igmas is able to provide a much more 
detailed evaluation of the anomalies measurements. Basically, 
the program uses the representation of geological structures as 
three-dimensional polyhedrons of any shape. The user models the 
geological structures until the calculated anomalies agree with 
the measured values. 
  As Goetze reports, the result is then illustrated on the 
screen which greatly facilitates the search for a potential 
deposit site. Igmas can also be used for the interpretation of 
gravimetric well hole measurements. 
  The program has interfaces to connect to conventional 
seismic 
evaluation programs and therefore allows a complex 
interpretation of the measured values. Igmas can also be used 
for environmental purposes such as waste dump and cavity studies.

<F P=106> [Article by Thierry Lucas: "A Technological Bound in </F>
Malfunction Analysis"; L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction is "A new, 
more powerful program to better pinpoint the combined causes of 
breakdowns"] 
  [Text] What do an automobile, an airplane, a chemical 
factory, and a satellite have in common? The answer: All of them 
are complex, multicomponent systems whose reliability engineers 
must be able to gauge from the moment of their design. To carry 
out these calculations, manufacturers have been using 
"malfunction tree" analysis software for many years. Now, a 
wholly new technique developed by Bull researchers makes it 
possible to boost the complexity of systems analyzed in this way 
by a factor of 100 or 1,000! The new technology has been 
incorporated into Metaprime, a malfunction-tree-analysis 
software program marketed by Simulog. Metaprime is offered on 
Unix stations, in conjunction with the program Open Modline, 
which supplies the graphics tools for modeling and interpreting 
the results. 
  The method's basic analytical principle has not changed: 
Starting with their knowledge of the system's architecture (a 
car is composed of an engine, a gearbox, steering, etc.), 
engineers systematically deduce all the combinations of causes 
that could trigger a breakdown. The major undesirable event 
(plane crash, environmental accident in a chemical plant, and so 
on) can be broken down in this way into basic events such as the 
failure of an electrical circuit, the malfunctioning of a valve, 
etc. The various elements are represented in a tree graph that 
shows the link between each malfunction and its causes and 
consequences. "Qualitative analysis of the malfunction tree can 
already identify the combination of causes that suffice to 
create a failure," explains Duc Duong, Simulog's technical 
director. "But to go farther, engineers must assign a 
probability value to each basic event and calculate the system's 
resultant overall reliability. Metaprime is especially good at 
this quantitative analysis of malfunction trees." Indeed, once a 
tree has grown to several hundred "branches", the systematic 
calculation of probabilities quickly eats up prohibitive amounts 
of computer processing time. What makes Bull's method, which 
employs a complete set of new algorithms, superior is its 
ability to manipulate data in a comprehensive way, without 
causing an explosion in combinations. As a result, engineers 
will be able to rigorously analyze the reliability of the most 
complex systems, without resorting to always-tricky 
approximations.

<F P=106> [Article by Lorenz Winter: "ACRI Plans to Market Own First </F>
Supercomputer Model in 1996"; Subheadline: "Former Bull Director 
Stern Is Company's Owner"] 
  [Text] Paris--By mid-1995, the 
Advanced Computer Research International [ACRI] firm, 
headquartered in Lyon, intends to unveil the initial prototype 
of the supercomputer it will have developed. When Jaques Stern 
first announced his objective in 1989, it was pretty risky 
business wanting to be on a par with companies like Cray, NEC, 
Hitachi or IBM. 
  Because of some skillful maneuvering by ACRI's founder, 
however, the project finally won credibility in recent months. 
In early 1993, for instance, DEC, Bull, France Telecom, energy 
supplier EDF, the holding industry of France's atomic energy 
commission and two banks invested FF40 million (approximately 
DM13 million) in Stern's company. Company spokeswoman, Anne 
Schroeder believes: "That will help us to narrow the gap with 
other European developers like Meiko in England, Parsytec in 
Germany or even Archipel and Telmat in France, and even to 
outstrip some of them before too long." 
<H5>  Cray Minority Participation Conceivable </H5>
  In the February operation, none of the partners was supposed 
to have acquired more than seven percent in ACRI. A second 
capital increase is supposed to follow this autumn. According to 
Stern, it will be "broader and more international in scope" than 
the first one. That would make ACRI more extensively secure 
financially, but its owner will then have to forgo his present 
capital majority. 
  Fifty percent of the firm's initial capital came from Stern 
SA trust assets, 25 percent took the form of a French government 
loan and the remaining 25 percent came from the European 
Community's [EC] Esprit program. 
  Shortly after the initial injection of capital, Stern came 
to 
an agreement with DEC, whereby, except for a processor it 
developed on its own, ACRI will also use the U.S. Alpha-Reduced 
Instruction Set Computer [RISC] Central Processing Unit [CPU] 
and its UNIX version for its computers. 
<H5>  Sales Offices Planned for U.S. and Europe </H5>
  In April, then, there was an additional technology 
partnership with Cray. Under its terms, the French and Americans 
established the Acset company in Belgium to develop a common 
compiler for both companies' equipment. Nearly 20 of ACRI's and 
Cray's engineers and technicians are also supposed to be 
cooperating via Acset on the portability and optimization of 
applications programs. According to Stern, subsequent minority 
participation by Cray in ACRI is "not inconceivable." 
  ACRI currently employs a total of 160 employees. Even before 
yearend, the number of jobs is supposed to climb to 200. The 
company is already scouting out new spaces downtown, in 
preparation for production of the initial small series run. 
Company spokeswoman Schroeder opines that, after the 1995 
prototypes, a final entry-level model and a range of 
modular-construction computers can be expected. 
  Initially, about 10 preliminary installations are planned 
among a number of preferred customers in French and European 
industry. Supercomputers are used in the petroleum sector and 
the auto industry for modeling of products and processes. Stern 
believes that now, biochemistry, pharmaceuticals, banking and 
insurance are also appropriate users. In industry, mainframes 
are mostly obsolescent. Yet, the penetration of scientific 
methods in corporate management is rapidly creating demand for a 
new generation of large computers. 
  ACRI is already planning to set up a sales representation to 
market its products in the U.S. and another one for the European 
market. As Stern emphasizes: "not necessarily headquartered in 
France."

  [Text] Development of the European fighter aircraft, the 
Eurofighter, is running behind schedule and the costs are 
escalating accordingly. The Defense Ministry is currently 
examining calls from the industry for several hundred million 
German marks [DM] occasioned by sluggish development, technical 
modifications, and the usual price increases. It is understood 
that a sum of up to DM670 million is at stake, only DM300 
million of which are regarded as justified in Defense Ministry 
circles. However, the ministry does not intend to give an 
official assessment of the industry's demands until the 
Eurofighter has undertaken a successful maiden flight. This is 
not expected to take place until next spring. 
  The fighter's maiden flight has already been postponed 
several times because considerable technical problems have 
arisen in the flight control system. After Gripen-type test 
aircraft crashed in Sweden, the industry decided to proceed with 
extreme caution. The Defense Ministry now expects the maiden 
flight to take place in April 1994. Only when a test flight has 
been successfully accomplished will the ministry enter into 
negotiations over the increased development cost. The industry 
is, of course, prepared to bear part of the extra cost, because 
it is itself responsible for the delay in development. 
  At the Defense Ministry they say that the negotiations on 
the 
new development price will be extremely difficult and could take 
months, because the economic situation has hardly put industry 
in a mood for compromise. The industry's demand is referred to 
as mere figure-work that can only serve as a basis for an 
initial position. If the extra development costs were accepted, 
they could only be billed on completion of the development work, 
thus not affecting the Bundeswehr's current budget. 
  The technical and military requirements that the aircraft 
will have to meet so that the sale price can be reduced will 
also be decided by next spring. The heads of the air forces of 
the four countries involved (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, 
and Spain) will decide in January on the new performance 
specification. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe had referred to 
DM90 million as an ideal price, but the industry has so far 
scaled its calculations down from DM123 to 102 million. 
According to a Defense Ministry report, preparations for 
production are now scheduled to begin in 1996 owing to the 
development delay, so Parliament could vote whether or not to 
purchase the aircraft in 1995. 
  Daimler-Benz group subsidiary German Aerospace AG (DASA), 
which is based in Munich, does not rule out a withdrawal from 
the defense sector if the defense budget suffers further 
reductions. DASA intends to cut 2,500 of its remaining 11,600 
jobs in its defense and civil systems business division by the 
end of 1996.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "SAGEM: Nav/Attack Systems for </F>
Fighter Aircraft Upgrades: Belgium, Pakistan and Now Poland"] 
  [Text] SAGEM has been selected for the avionics system 
upgrade of the PZL Iryda I-22. The operation will take place on 
the PZL MIELEC premises, in cooperation with the Polish Aviation 
Institute, designer of the aircraft. The upgraded version Iryda 
M-93 will be provided with an inertial navigation system (SAGEM 
ULISS) wide field of view HUD [Head-up Display], HOTAS [Hands On 
Throttle and Stick] pilot interface, full color EFIS [Electronic 
Flight Information System] and extended attack capability. The 
first flight tests are due by the end of 1993. Qualification of 
MAESTRO [Modular Avionics Enhancement System Targeted for 
Retrofit Operations], the integrated Weapon Delivery, Navigation 
and Reconnaissance System designed and supplied by SAGEM is in 
progress to equip the Mirage III fleet of the Pakistani Air 
Force. Upgrade plans include extension of Air to Air 
operational performance and introduction of Air to Ground mode, 
to give the aircraft multimission capabilities. In addition, 
the aircraft will be fitted with multimode pulse doppler radar. 
A first production order was issued in June 1993. Two versions 
are being retrofitted, the trainer/strike aircraft and the 
multirole fighter. Another version of this system, designed by 
SAGEM for the Belgian Air Force Mirage V has recently completed 
with full success an extensive flight test campaign. Full 
operational clearance was awarded by the customer in May 1993. 
Production phase has recently started for upgrade of 15 
single-seat Mirage V BA and 5 two-seat Mirage V BDs, two 
aircraft versions are concerned, the trainer/fighter and the 
attack/reconnaissance. MAESTRO (Modular Avionics Enhancement 
System Targeted for Retrofit Operations), with the SAGEM 
Nav/Attack systems for aircraft upgrades as cornerstone, 
provides capabilities at par with today's front line fighters. 
If features: Full inertial and GPS [Global Positioning System] 
performance (SAGEM ULISS or SIGMA) -- TERCOR terrain contour 
matching for stealth navigation and blind attack (SAGEM EBS 1501 
Bubble Memory) -- Wide field of view HUD, FLIR [Forward-Looking 
Infrared] compatible (SAGEM Group IRIS FLIR), -- HOTAS pilot 
interface (Hands On Throttle and Stick), -- Air-to-Ground and 
Air-to-Air fire control including Radar or Laser Rangefinder -- 
Self protection system (Radar Warning, Chaff and Flares) -- All 
digital third generation mission planning system (SAGEM CIRCE 
20001). SAGEM holds full flight test and qualification. The 
upgrade is performed within the customer's overhaul facility, 
enabling an extremely short turn-around and an increase of 
customer's support capability. The same system and methodology 
have been applied to a number of other aircraft: Jaguar 
International, A5, etc.

airplane turbines will receive a ceramic coating, which prolongs 
the life span of turbines considerably. Interturbine purchased 
this new procedure from Ukraine. 
  The project could yield some 35 jobs in the short term. Over 
the next few years, 20 million guilders will be invested in the 
plant in an attempt to commercialize the ceramic-coating 
process. Interturbine already has three plants in Lomm which 
repair turbines and produce engine parts. 
  The former Soviet Union Armed Forces had been applying the 
ceramic coating on the engines of MiG fighter aircraft for 15 
years already. The coating protects engine parts against heat 
and corrosion. The United States has for years been trying to 
learn this secret formula to which the MiG's, among other 
things, owe their good reputation. Until now, the West has been 
using a metal coating for turbines. 
  Airplane parts can be used for 4,000 hours longer after they 
have been treated. Turbines for use on the ground can be used 
for 15,000 hours longer, according to Interturbine.

  [Text] Belgian Advanced Technology Systems (BATS) supplied 
battlefield surveillance radars to the Belgian army and thus 
developed expertise in signal processing. It now wants to enter 
the civilian market. 
  At the request of the military market, BATS developed radars 
which are linked to other sensors, for example Doppler devices 
with video, infrared cameras, or image intensifiers. "The 
integration of radar with image technology provides an entirely 
different type of surveillance system," according to Gerald 
Lejeune, marketing director of BATS in the Sart Tilman 
technology park at Angleur near Liege. "The EUCLID (European 
Cooperation for the Long Term in Defense) consortium is talking 
about data fusion." 
  BATS is now expanding on its experience with the SCB-2130A 
field radar. SCB stands for "Surveillance du Champ de Bataille" 
[Battlefield Surveillance]. Since 1990, the company has 
supplied 25 radars of this type to the Belgian Army. This radar 
has a range of between 100 meters and 33.5 km. It can "see" 
tanks at a distance of 30 km and people at 15 km, but also 
registers low-flying helicopters and ULM [undersea long-range 
missile] equipment. The practised eye of the operator picks out 
every dot on the Barco [Belgian electronics company] color 
screen. The entire surrounding area can be mapped out. The 
radar can operate in a network, via a connection to the BAMS 
field radio. 
  "What is known as the 33-km line of sight is virtually 
impossible to find in Belgium. The original intention was to 
use the field radar in Germany," says Gerald Lejeune -- in 
particular with reconnaissance troops in Dellbrueck, where the 
radar would be fitted on top of three M-113 tanks in each of 
seven platoons. The restructuring activities implemented by 
Defense Minister Delcroix have turned these into four platoons, 
with the radar on three M- 133's and one UNIMOG. 
  BATS is also exporting its radar. It has found customers in 
South America, the Middle East, and in Europe, but for a total 
of fewer than 20 orders. Gerald Lejeune denies that a BATS 
radar was exported to South Africa via Brazil. 
  In Europe and elsewhere the company has issued tenders for 
an 
export version of the battlefield surveillance radar and the 
border surveillance radar. The price of the export version is 
between 10 and 15 million Belgian francs, depending on the 
configuration. 
  "After all, every customer has individual requirements. If 
we adapt the software, the equipment is suitable for still more 
applications. An operational coastal version locates shipping 
movements. The radar can monitor airfields or register the 
impact of artillery and assist in directing the fire." 
<H5>  Civilian Market </H5>
  Through the battlefield surveillance radars, BATS' expertise 
expanded in the field of signal processing. "We developed 
algorithms that were integrated into neural networks, fuzzy 
logic, and artificial intelligence," says G. Lejeune. 
  Up until two years ago, the company directed its expertise 
exclusively toward the military market. Since then, however, it 
has been seeking out commercial applications in the civilian 
sector. 
  An attempt to launch an ESA space project bore no fruit. As 
a partner in the European ESPRIT [European Strategic Program for 
R&amp;D in Information Technologies] program, BATS is now 
developing 
a transmitter and a receiver for a wireless local area network. 
"In an industrial environment, the transmitter eliminates 
disturbing factors such as heat, vibration, shocks, and 
electromagnetic and other fields, using frequency hopping and 
spread spectrum. Until now, these techniques had only been used 
in military applications," explains G. Lejeune. This year, BATS 
is demonstrating its local area network in the Cockerill steel 
plant. 
  "We are also developing the "autoreverse." This is a small 
ultrasonic device mounted to the rear shock absorber of a 
vehicle, which gives out a warning when the vehicle comes too 
close to an obstacle." 
  The appliance is ready for mass production and contacts have 
been established in France and the United Kingdom. "We are 
hoping that services can be developed in the civilian sector in 
signal processing, microwaves, real-time software, quality 
control, and project management," says Lejeune. "If civilian 
activities expand, then a sister company will probably be set 
up." 
<H5>  Other Products </H5>
  BATS' first product was a ground navigation system, for 
which 
Taman of Israel bought the production license. 
  This inertial system tracks the positions of the Belgian 
artillery and the reconnaissance troops' M-113 tanks, as well as 
the Netherlands Patriot launchers in Germany. 
  BATS has also spent three years working on a training 
simulator to train field radar operators in identifying typical 
signatures. The Belgian Army is buying one of these. 
  With assistance from EUCLID, the company is working on an 
automatic target classification system, and is now also offering 
its software knowledge as a supplier. "For example, we would 
really like to take part in SEROS II, the Air Force program that 
monitors traffic over Belgium," explains Gerald Lejeune. 
  As part of the CARAPACE program, BATS has been promised 300 
million francs in indirect compensations. However, there is as 
yet no contract. Talks with main contractor Dassault 
Electronique are continuing. "We are confident," says Gerald 
Lejeune. 
  Within the C-130 modernization program, BATS is building the 
so- called hot bench for Honeywell, due for completion at the 
beginning of 1994. This is a test bench for aircraft 
electronics. 
  The company also receives direct compensations within the 
scope of the BEMILDAT program, which was allocated to the 
Canadian Northern Telecom. Until the end of this year, it will 
manufacture the electronic cards that will be integrated into 
the final product. BATS is also looking for a way into data 
fusion systems engineering. 
<H5>  Mixed Origin </H5>
  In 1991, BATS and its 43 employees achieved a turnover of 
425 
million francs. Last year, that figure increased to 1.1 billion 
francs. Via Innotech, BATS is a 49 percent subsidiary of the 
Flemish Regional Investment Company. It belongs 51 percent to 
Eltem-Holding in Amsterdam -- a company with no employees. 
  BATS was founded in September 1984. This was three months 
after the Ministry of Defense allocated 1.14 billion francs for 
the development and production of 25 ultra-modern battlefield 
surveillance radars. "Defense decided to develop its own radar 
from scratch, to satisfy specific operational requirements," 
explains marketing director Gerald Lejeune. 
  The development took three years. Elta of Israel, part of 
Israel Aircraft Industries, contributed its experience in 
hyperfrequency. 
  BATS, as integrator, used the services of, among others, 
Barco for the monitor, Britte for the precision mechanics, EMG 
for the support system and Electronic Apparatus for the 
circuitry. By the end of 1992, BATS had delivered all the 
systems and the logistics phase began -- supplying replacement 
parts and documentation, training and maintenance courses. The 
contract covered both the development and the production and 
improvement of the device. Since then, the company has 
concluded 14 follow-up contracts.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fibre-Guided Spy Plane Flies 20 Km"] </F>
  [Text] Aerospatiale and Sogerma-Socea have developed a 
remotely piloted vehicle (RPV) called Pirat (Pirate), which both 
sends and receives data through a fibre optic cable. It flies 
up to 20 km from the operator. 
  The cable controlling the 2 m long RPV has been developed to 
resist the stresses forced on it by erratic movements. The 
aircraft itself weighs 20 kg and it is able to carry a payload 
of up to 30 kg, such as a TV camera. 
  Optical transmission of the collected data also means there 
is no "signature" so the data can be neither jammed nor 
intercepted, the developers claim. 
  Originally developed for "intelligence gathering in theatres 
of operation" the Pirat has been adapted to civilian projects 
such as security patrolling of inaccessible locations or 
industrial inspection. 
  The relatively cheap fibre link is intended to be an 
expendable item. It may be detached before the plane returns. 
Different recording devices may be carried by the Pirat's 
modular fuselage.

<F P=106> [Article by Marco Tavasani: "400-Billion-Lire Order for </F>
Alenia"] 
  [Text] The minister of defense has solved the dilemma 
about the modernization program for the air force whilst waiting 
for the four-nation fighter plane, Eurofighter-2000, the 
delivery of which is planned for 2005. It has been decided to 
modernize 65 F-104S's and to lease 24 Tornado-ADV's (Air Defense 
Variant) from the British government for 10 years. This gives 
Alenia (Finmeccanica group) a deep breath of oxygen from the 
industrial point of view, and also under a social profile, as 
the modernization program for the F-104's will mean that no 
additional personnel will be laid off from the Turin factories. 
  Let us look at the two operations in detail. The contract 
was given to Alenia yesterday morning, and it is worth about 400 
billion lire. It will ensure that the air force will have an 
interceptor fighter that, although it has an average life of 15 
years, could acceptably carry out the role of short range 
interceptor fighter for another 10 years. The first renovated 
Starfighters, that will carry the initials ASAM (Updated 
Modified Avionics System) will be available for the four 
designated air bases at Cameri, Grossetto, Istrana, and Cervia, 
18 months after the placing of the contract. The interventions 
of Alenia, and the other national subcontracting companies, 
mainly regard rewiring and the substitution of other systems, as 
well as the installation of a new and more potent inertia 
platform to assure more precise navigation. The aircraft will 
be armed with two Aim-9L Sidewinder missiles with infrared 
guidance systems, and a couple of Aspide missiles with radar 
guidance systems, built by Alenia. The 65 F-104's that are to 
be modernized will be chosen by the air force from the 120 
airplanes of this type in their possession, giving priority to 
the airframes that have suffered less structural fatigue, and 
the last one will be delivered three years after the start of 
the program. Substantially it is an operation that tends to 
increase the overall reliability of the aircraft, without 
noticeably increasing its operational capacity, that remains the 
same as that of a jet that is over 20 years old. The other 
operation provides for the leasing of 24 Tornado-ADV's, that the 
RAF [Royal Air Force] has grounded since the end of East-West 
tensions. It is an aircraft that has 70 percent in common with 
the attack version of the Tornado, that was used by Italy during 
the Gulf War. The most notable differences are found in the 
electronics system, which has been optimized for long range 
interception, and amongst other things the ADV has a potent Fox 
Hunter firing radar produced by GEC. In fact 173 aircraft of 
this type were built. It was developed by British Aerospace to 
meet the threat of the Soviet Backfire some distance away from 
Britain. The contract is worth 700 billion lire spread out over 
10 years, 270 billion lire will cover the leasing, and 430 
billion lire will pay for spares, assistance, maintenance, 
manuals, and training for the pilots, and intercept officers, 
that are the mission commanders. The 24 Tornados will be 
assigned to the bases at Gioia del Colle and Trapani, covering a 
gap in our air defense in the Mediterranean area. Without doubt 
this operation will have a decisive influence on the 
British-Italian policy agreements for the Eurofighter-2000 
program, as well as guaranteeing sufficient work for the 
technicians of Alenia, avoiding the possible dismembering of the 
company's work force, to cover the three years that still remain 
before the European program starts at an industrial level.

<F P=106> [Article by Joris Janssen Lok: "Electrolysis Helps </F>
Destroying Ammunition Mountain"] 
  [Text] Dounreay -- A mountain of several hundred thousand 
tons of chemical weapons and conventional explosives is what we 
inherited from two world wars and several decades of Cold War. 
The actual scope of the environmental problem is now becoming 
clear. A company located at the wild coasts of northern 
Scotland is offering a solution. 
  "After World War II alone, 65,000 tons of chemical weapons 
from German, British, American, Italian, Hungarian, and Russian 
origin were dumped into the Baltic Sea," says Bill Batey from 
the heavily protected nuclear facility of the British Atomic 
Energy Authority (AEA) at Dounreay, a privatized nuclear 
technology company. "Ammunitions were dumped also in the waters 
surrounding the UK and the Bay of Biscay. Now, after nearly 50 
years, the shells start decaying and the release of highly toxic 
materials into the atmosphere is becoming a real threat." 
<H5>  Electrolysis </H5>
  Batey's team of scientists have filed an international 
patent 
application for an environment-friendly chemical degradation 
process that can be applied to all explosives and chemical 
weapons such as mustard and nerve gases. They claim that the 
process destroys these substances without having to incinerate 
or detonate them. Incineration and detonation are unacceptable 
methods for environmental and cost reasons. 
  Batey is heading a division responsible for decommissioning 
nuclear reactors and managing radioactive wastes. Initially, 
the process was developed as an environment-friendly way to 
degrade low-level liquid radioactive waste. It is based on 
electrolysis and decomposes hazardous materials into the 
harmless substances CO2, water, NOx, and a small amount of 
acids, without any side effects. Batey: "We use silver as 
catalyzer for degrading organic phosphor compounds, which are 
found in explosives as well as in the nerve gases VX, Tabun, 
Sarin, and Soman. These are the gases mostly used by the United 
States, Russia, and the UK. To destroy chlorine compounds used 
in mustard gases, we use ruthenium as catalyzer." 
  The AEA entered into a joint venture with the Aberdeen-based 
company SubSea Offshore, which will implement its experience and 
specialist techniques to track and haul up the dumped ammunition 
and degrade it on board of a special vessel using the Dounreay 
method. According to Mark Vorenkamp, an American of Netherlands 
origin and director of the subsidiary SubSea Survey, "the AEA 
process is still in the laboratory stage, but plans are to 
integrate the electrolysis unit into mobile equipment which can 
be taken to the site of operations. It will be called 
`Electrochemical Oxidation System,' abbreviated ECOS." 
<H5>  Billion-Dollar Market </H5>
  In the meantime, SubSea has already acquired an advanced 
sea-bed research ship from the British Navy. The disposal of 
the gigantic military "inheritance" from the past century 
constitutes an $8-billion market over the next 10 years. This 
market is more or less evenly divided between Europe, North 
America, and the former USSR. 
  Not only old ammunition will have to be destroyed. According 
to the Chemical Weapons Convention, all chemical weapons will 
have to disappear worldwide. This will be done under the 
auspices of a UN organization to be established in The Hague. 
Together with SubSea, AEA has contacted the Chemical Warfare 
Center of the British Ministry of Defense in Porton Down, which 
will conduct further tests with the ECOS installation. Another 
British military center had already proved its efficiency with 
explosives. 
<H5>  Conferences </H5>
  The large number of conferences and symposiums on the 
disposal of ammunition organized primarily in Germany indicates 
that it is becoming a pressing problem. This week, for 
instance, the northern German city of Muenster held a seminar on 
"Crossborder Environmental Problems Caused by Military 
Activities" of NATO and former Warsaw-Pact countries. Last 
month, the same city of Muenster hosted another conference on 
old chemical ammunition organized by the German Army and the 
Swedish SIPRI [Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute]. In Munich, Deutsche Aerospace and an American 
interest group [not further identified] sponsored a conference 
on the removal of military pollution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article based on interview with M. Heerman, </F>
chief of Siemens' Oostkamp-based Laboratory for Production 
Techniques, and Engineer L. Danneels: "New Structure for 
Electrical Appliances"; date and place of interview not given] 
  [Excerpts] The current structure of electronic 
subassemblies (for example, machine controls) is not 
recycling-friendly. This is partly due to the fact that an 
electrical appliance contains several of the elements in 
Mendeleyev's table and, given the minute quantities of each 
element, dismantling and recovery is not really profitable. 
  The research department of Siemens in Oostkamp is 
specializing in making processes and production methods more 
environmentally-friendly. It has also looked at the structure 
of electronic appliances. This led, among other things, to a 
new way of constructing electronic subassemblies. This 
technique will now also be marketed outside Siemens. M. 
Heerman, chief of the Laboratory for Production Techniques of 
Siemens in Oostkamp, and Engineer L. Danneels talked about the 
new technique. 
<H5>  Environmentally-Friendly Production </H5>
  [passage omitted outlining changes in environment 
legislation 
over the past five years] The environmental charges, which have 
previously been paid implicitly by the government (or by 
nature), are now increasingly being picked up by manufacturers. 
Given that this has resulted in the three environmental aspects 
-- air, water, and refuse -- gradually becoming the focus of 
attention, the realization slowly grew that blithely rotating 
the pollution between air, water, refuse, and energy is not an 
environmentally-friendly mode of operation. In any event, closer 
analysis showed that this method was also unnecessarily 
expensive. 
<H5>  Think Ecologically </H5>
  Materials and energy flows were then examined and an attempt 
was made to minimize the total of all the flows. This is taking 
place first and foremost in the internal production process. 
Within Siemens' organization, Siemens Oostkamp has already 
successfully carried out instructions to "make part of the 
production process more environmentally friendly," on several 
occasions, particularly in German establishments. Making 
something more environmentally friendly can be by better 
streamlining of production (which means, for example, 
eliminating interim storage, and simply doing away with 
lubricating steel tools to prevent rusting, only to clean them 
again afterwards). Sometimes, it can be achieved by using 
different production methods (for example, using sludge-free 
techniques such as electrolysis when regenerating treatment 
baths). 
  One essential step in this process is that when new products 
and production processes are developed, those responsible should 
begin to think in terms of ecological balance sheets: The 
environmental impact of the entire process -- from raw material 
to end-of-life product. In order to make it possible to prepare 
these ecological balance sheets, Siemens Oostkamp has perfected 
a software package that can compare the ecological balance 
sheets of various production processes. This package is now 
being marketed by Siemens Nixdorf. In addition, right from the 
product development stage, attention must be paid to building in 
a certain level of "recycling potential." 
<H5>  Modifying Product Composition </H5>
  Under pressure from the legislator, those in product 
development have also woken up to the obligation that certain 
products have to be taken back for recycling at the end of their 
useful life. Returning products was for a time restricted to 
packaging (and packaging refuse), but as of January 1994 
electrical engineering manufacturers and distributors in Germany 
will also have to take back decommissioned products. [passage 
omitted on shortening life cycles of consumer electronics 
products] 
  Companies are therefore finding themselves up against a huge 
refuse mountain and do not know what to do with it -- dumping is 
definitely not a solution the legislator will permit. The only 
answer is to break it up and sort it into raw materials which 
can be processed together, which is an expensive method of 
recycling material. Processing today's electrical appliances 
costs 3-4 German marks per kilogram if it is carried out by 
specialized, environmentally-conscious reprocessing companies. 
If Siemens were to take back all its appliances, that would 
mean 200,000 tonnes per year. To be profitable, these recycling 
costs have to drop, and this implies only one solution: Change 
the raw materials and the structure of the new products released 
on to the market so that material recycling becomes possible at 
the end of the product's life. 
<H5>  `Original' Solution </H5>
  Siemens recognized this problem some years ago. Around five 
years ago, its Central Research department was therefore given 
the task of finding a more recycling-friendly composition for 
electrical products. This work was carried out by Siemens 
Oostkamp. Its instructions were: "Not just green, but also 
blue," which means not only looking at the 
environmentally-friendly aspects, but also making sure that the 
new production method is cheaper and offers technological 
advantages! This led to what is known as the SIL 
[Injection-Molded Components with Integrated Conductive Paths]. 
  So what does this involve? A normal electrical appliance is 
usually built up of various printed circuits, plug-connected to 
a board or independently mounted in a chassis and mutually 
linked via connectors and cabling. This is usually surrounded 
by a metal shield, so that the entire unit complies with EMC 
[electromagnetic compatibility) standards, which is then fitted 
with a housing. The components on the boards are usually cooled 
using special cooling fins. If this construction method is 
examined closely, it is obvious that it is a material-greedy and 
expensive (labor-intensive) method. This is due to the 
separation of the functions of electronics, cooling, shielding, 
substrate, plug, and housing. Using the SIL technique, certain 
functions in the housing are integrated. 
  In the housing, the functions of EMC shielding, heat 
removal, 
plug function, and conductors between connector pins will be 
combined. This has been made possible by the choice of a 
strong, heat-resistant, injectable plastic. In addition, a 
suitable production method was developed for applying a copper 
layer to this plastic, a laser-based process was used to make a 
three-dimensional conductor structure from it, and a process was 
developed enabling soldering without causing damage. 
<H5>  Test Case Proves Viability </H5>
  This method is used to build the substrate of a PLC 
[programmable logic control] circuit. The initial advantage is 
the reduction in components and suppliers. The old construction 
required 11 individual components (housing, EMC shielding, 
insulation, PCB [printed circuit board] with connectors and heat 
removal fins, and several sets of screws and bolts) from various 
suppliers, all of which of course had to be transported (also 
environmentally-unfriendly). Now, the housing with integrated 
pins, holders, and securing fins are all made in one piece, 
using the injection molding process. The metallization layer 
provides EMC shielding, heat removal, and conductor connections 
between the connector pins of the plug connection. 
  The second advantage is the level of recyclability of the 
product. The 11 functions are achieved using only two materials 
(plastic and copper), both of which can be recycled. 
  Advantage number three relates to economics. The production 
process is simpler, as a result of the short manufacturing time 
and the elimination of many suppliers. The test case also 
proves that production itself is clearly cheaper (if sufficient 
numbers are made). 
  The fourth advantage is the extremely fine laser structuring 
(approximately 100 micron), which means that the direct 
integration of SMD [surface mounted devices] or even bare 
integrated circuits or microengineering components is possible. 
  However, the big disadvantage is that this is all very new 
and still in the design phase. All the possibilities have yet 
to be "discovered." Prototyping is more difficult: As with a 
designer housing, making a model is difficult and 
time-consuming. For this application, the model was cut from a 
solid block. Siemens Oostkamp hopes that the use of 
stereolithography (making pieces from a CAD [computer-aided 
design] design using adapted machines) can provide an answer. 
Nevertheless, current experience is already teaching that this 
method is an ecological alternative to the present, 
non-ecological structure. Experience has yet to be gained. 
  Marketing has started: Siemens Oostkamp is offering its 
services to all electronics manufacturers wanting to learn how 
to integrate the new method into their products. 
<H5>  From Central Research Department to The Outside World </H5>
  In the past, every major company had a large research and 
development section where technological development took place 
and, as a spin-off, improved production techniques were devised. 
Laser etching (writing to surfaces of resistances and 
capacitors, for instance, using a guided laser beam, which means 
the message can flexibly be adapted per component) was one of 
the techniques perfected by the Oostkamp plant of Siemens' 
Central Research department. Siemens' Central Research also 
financed Oostkamp's reorientation toward the development of 
environmentally-friendly production techniques, which started 
five years ago. 
  All R&amp;D functions -- the development of both 
technologies and 
products -- were previously seen as strategic and were developed 
within the framework of a centrally controlled research policy. 
One company, no matter how large, can no longer afford to 
specialize in everything and carry out all the research and 
development it requires. Thus, for example, the development of 
general production techniques is no longer considered a 
component of core business research. For this reason, Siemens' 
Central Research department is gradually being slimmed down. 
One of the three departments in Germany was closed and 
activities in the Oostkamp-based research facility -- which has 
already been mentioned above and which was the only foreign 
research team in this centralized R&amp;D department -- were 
reoriented. Oostkamp is now entering the market as a technical 
consultancy agency. The goal is clear: subcontracting for 
third parties. Logically speaking, it will enter the field in 
which it excels: environmentally-friendly production techniques 
for electronic engineering. Activities also include consulting 
with respect to process techniques, for example, making chemical 
surface techniques more environmentally friendly. These 
techniques were demonstrated at the IFEST fair in October. 
Oostkamp also wants to help other electronics companies to 
develop products and subassemblies using a new, 
recycling-friendly method.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Geothermal Energy: A Serious </F>
Alternative"] 
  [Text] European researchers have high hopes for geothermal 
energy. Thirty years from now, this energy source should be a 
serious alternative to nuclear power. 
  Geothermal energy is very different from other "alternative" 
energy resources such as wind and solar power, because it has 
the potential to produce power at an industrial scale, of the 
order of hundreds of megawatts. Italy, for instance, already 
produces 500 megawatts of electricity per year this way. 
  The intention is to construct a giant underground heat 
exchanger linked to a turbine to test the industrial viability 
of this renewable source of power. However, significant 
difficulties include the economic and technical viability of 
recovering this energy in small fields (typical in Europe) and 
the high costs of hot dry rock research. Consequently, the 
success of the latest Community projects will determine the 
future of geothermal energy use. 
  Under the Joule II (non-nuclear energy) programme, 
scientists 
at Soultz-sous-Forets (France, Lower Rhine) began work in 
December 1992 on a project consolidating research underway since 
the 1970s. The aim is to inject water into hot rocks at a depth 
of 4,000 m (in a granite platform criss-crossed by numerous 
faults forming a giant `radiator' at 180 degrees Celsius) to 
produce sufficient energy to drive an electricity generator. 
  Two other sites are being examined in the United Kingdom and 
Germany. Some 60 scientists are involved in this project 
(ECU5.5 million, plus a further ECU3.3 million for 1994-95), 
from around twenty universities and institutes in France, United 
Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. 
  In Soultz, the first stage involves drilling boreholes 
through the sedimentary layer and granite platform, to prove the 
technical feasibility of an industrial-scale pilot with a 
capacity of several Megawatts. Equipped with a generator, this 
industrial pilot will be built after 1995. If all goes well, a 
prototype geothermal energy power station (producing 5-10 
Megawatts) will follow around the year 2000. It will be linked 
to the electricity grid and work as a complement to traditional, 
small power stations. 
  Better understanding of the basement rock fracture systems 
has already allowed researchers to produce a model of a Hot Dry 
Rock reservoir. A 3,950 m borehole has been drilled and could 
form the first part of the future pilot system, while the next 
borehole (4,000 m deep) will be used to test the circulation of 
hot water. With these holes, researchers will be able to begin 
construction of the pilot and study problems like corrosion, 
pumping, and modelling (chemical and thermal) of the rocks. 
  Corrosion problems, which are crucial to the industrial 
phase, will be solved by removable internal tubing systems 
and/or injection of corrosion-inhibiting substances. Hydraulic 
models of the rocky massifs exploited (over 3,000 cubic km) will 
be made to check the impact on deep water resources in the 
region. Calculations show a balance could be quickly 
established between the pumping system and natural water 
circulation between the rock faults. An early estimate of 
progress and planning of the industrial pilot project will be 
presented in Soultz in 1994. 
  Whatever the future of geothermal energy, this research has 
already improved understanding of rock mechanics and drilling 
techniques. This knowledge will find applications in the oil 
and civil engineering sectors. Another spin-off has been the 
composition of an Atlas of Geothermal Resources in the EC, 
Switzerland and Austria, to be updated this year to include 
Central Europe.

<F P=106> [Article signed E.F.: "Treatment of Waste Water Reduces </F>
Production Costs"] 
  [Text] The recuperation, in waste water, of 80 percent of 
acids used in the manufacture of capacitors is allowing Siemens 
to make savings of up to 6 million French francs [Fr] per year 
with the added bonus of environment protection. 
  Environment protection is no empty claim for Siemens, whose 
waste water treatment system is proving that an 
environment-friendly process does not necessarily cost more than 
traditional methods. The aluminum capacitor production plant of 
the Siemens Matsushita subsidiary in Heidenbeim, Germany has 
recently put into operation a dialysis system which enables 
about 80 percent of the acids used in manufacturing to be 
recuperated and reused in the production cycle. The investment 
required to set up this system amounted to 1.2 million German 
marks [DM] (Fr4.3 million), which is less than for a traditional 
system (DM1.7 million). In addition, the annual production 
costs have almost been reduced by a factor of four (DM0.6 
million instead of DM2.3 million). 
<H5>  Eliminating 6,000 Tonnes of Acid Sludge </H5>
  When waste waters are recovered after the aluminum etching 
stage in an aluminum capacitor production plant, they have 
strong concentrations of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids. 
Traditional water treatment systems include a neutralization 
phase followed by the separation of the liquid and solid parts. 
The liquids, which represent about 18,000 cubic meters per year 
in the Siemens Matsushita plant, are then drained via 
traditional sewers, while the solid matter, 6,000 to 7,000 
tonnes per year, is dumped on a waste belt. 
  The new system is based on the same principle as dialysis, 
with a membrane which directly separates the waste water into 
two parts, one rich in HCL and H2SO4 acids (up to 80 percent can 
be recuperated) and the other rich in metals. The former (460 
liters/hour) can be recuperated for use in acid baths during the 
capacitor production cycle. The latter (470 liters/hour), 
composed essentially of alumina salt and a low percentage of 
acids, can be used in organic filtering stations where it acts 
as a bacterial precipitating agent.

<F P=106> [Article signed Patricia Labiane: "A `MUST' For Avoiding </F>
Water Pollution"] 
  [Text] Just one storm and everything is overflowing. The 
sewers spill out onto the land, the water is full of heavy 
metals and hydrocarbons, etc. Heavy rainfall can multiply by up 
to 10 times the rate of pollution recorded during periods of dry 
weather. Water treatment stations are not capable of handling 
pollution exceeding three or four times that for dry weather 
conditions and do not perform their regulating role. The MUST 
project, launched by the Corporation for the Treatment and 
Economic Development of Water [OTV], a subsidiary of the 
Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE], proposes checking the 
overflow of waste water after periods of heavy rainfall. The 
European scientific research program, EUREKA [European Research 
Coordination Agency], found the scheme attractive enough to 
award it its European label last June. 
  The Must technology will be implemented progressively over 
the next four years. Of the 96.6 million French francs [Fr] it 
will cost, France will contribute Fr32 million, Fr10 million of 
which will come from the Ministries of Industry, Post and 
Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade. 
  The project, which replies to a European directive of May 
1991, combines 10 industrial partners from four Community 
countries. In addition to OTV from France, project leaders 
include the Danish pollution removal systems engineers I. 
Kruger, the Finnish chemical reagent producers Kemira Kemwater, 
and the British modeling researcher Wallingford Software. OTV, 
the European leader in the design and production of water 
treatment plants, is the prime contractor, assisted in France by 
other CGE subsidiaries: the Anjou Research economic interest 
grouping -- which centralizes the group's research work -- and 
Cochery-Bourdin-Chausse, specializing in road infrastructures. 
<H5>  Precise Statistics </H5>
  The project corresponds to a market with local communities 
estimated to be worth several hundreds of billions of francs 
over the next 20 years, a large share of which should return to 
the Compagnie Generale des Eaux. On the practical side of 
things, the project will propose "reservoir highways" underneath 
roads to collect rain water, new physical-chemical settling 
techniques for treatment plants, a system for storing the most 
polluted water before treatment, treatment plant biofilters that 
are better suited to respond to large fluctuations in flow, 
sensors to inform the plant of the level of pollution in the 
water that will be arriving, etc. 
<H5>  Computerized Rain </H5>
  The project also envisages carrying out a whole series of 
statistical studies that will simplify the adaptation of water 
treatment equipment. Patrick Binot, OTV's deputy technical 
director and head of development, explains: "For a given 
period, a rainfall curve is run through a computer model to 
determine the amount of polluting substances released in an 
average year by a given network and treatment plant, which can 
thus be minimized." This gives a whole armory with which to 
face up to any rain shower.

  [TEXT] After the "change-over" to German reunification, the 
Max Planck Society recognized its obligation to cooperate with 
the reorganization of research in the new states. It was not, 
however, ready to alter its views for the sake of rapidly 
establishing a unified structure of research in East and West. 
One of its principles is to establish a basic research institute 
only when there is an exceptional individual to lead it who 
represents an area of work, within a creditable and primarily 
academic field, which promises maximum innovations. 
  Therefore, according to President Hans Zacher in Berlin, an 
immediate program was begun in 1990, in which new and 
time-limited types of institutional research support were 
employed. To benefit university research in the East and at the 
same time to create appropriate fields for future Max Planck 
Institutes, so-called "task forces" were set up. 
Organizationally accompanied by the MPS and provided with 
"adequate" equipment, they were able to begin immediately and 
with "high scientific standards" in the universities in the new 
states. 
  However, they can only count on the support of the MPS for 
five years. By then they must be integrated into the current 
universities. To this purpose, agreements were made with the 
universities to appoint the group directors as university 
teachers, even though the universities were burdened with large 
surpluses in personnel. There was hardly any resistance from 
this side appealing to university autonomy in the choice of 
professors. The original goal of 25 groups has even been 
exceeded with a total of 28 task forces (270 positions) at seven 
universities in the five new states and Berlin. 
  In addition, according to Zacher, the MPS at the suggestion 
of the Council on Science converted two additional, long alien 
patterns of organization--also on only a time-limited basis: In 
Berlin two so-called branches of existing MPS institutes from 
the old states began work. The one is looked after by the Max 
Planck Institute (MPI) for Extraterrestrial Physics, the other 
by the MPI for Plasma Physics, both in Garching near Berlin. 
Whether they will remain in this form longer than the agreed 
five years will be decided by a later investigation. It is said 
that even university affiliation, especially with Humboldt 
University in Berlin, is conceivable. 
  In the end the MPS saw itself compelled by the Science 
Council to do something for the humanities task forces worth 
preserving from institutes of the "Academy of the Sciences of 
the GDR." They did not appear to be suitable as cores of 
autonomous MPS institutes, because their directions in research 
(European Enlightenment, History of Science, Literary Research, 
Modern Orient, Middle Eastern European Culture, Period History 
and General Linguistics) could all be established at 
universities, even if this didn't succeed at first. They were 
therefore gathered in Berlin in seven "main humanities research 
foci," so-called centers--not, however, under the cover of the 
MPS itself, but under that of their own sponsor established for 
them. 
  Whether they remain more than alien elements is still open. 
Recommendations concerning their future were obtained from a 
commission which involved researchers from the outside in 
addition to scientists of the MPS. Accordingly, the centers are 
either to operate in cooperation among themselves with "close 
contact" with the universities or to be established there 
directly. The Science Council will make recommendations 
regarding their final status by May 1994 at the latest. 
  Until now there has been resistance by the universities 
against the new "categories" and disagreement between the 
federal government and the states on financing. The closer the 
centers are to the universities, the more certain will their 
financing be a state matter. If they remain separate from the 
universities, other ways of financing would have to be found. It 
is precisely this, however, which could be difficult; because 
newly founded institutions have for some time been blocked by 
the Federal Minister of Finance. According to Zacher, the 
existence of the centers might depend to a great extent on the 
duration or extension of the "start-up financing," which in the 
meantime is assured until the end of 1994. 
  Thus, the MPS will in the end give up all the institutions 
of 
their immediate program--task forces, branches, centers; they 
are only temporarily lodged with the society. In the meantime 
the attention of the MPS in the new states is mainly aimed at 
establishing institutes which strive for innovation. Seven 
institutes have already been founded. Both of the Max Planck 
Institutes for Microstructure Physics (Halle) and for Colloid 
and Interface Research (Teltow) materialized due to 
recommendations from the Science Council. The MPS has 
established five more under its own direction: the Institutes 
for Infection Biology and for History of Science (both in 
Berlin), for Plant Physiology (Potsdam), for Economic Systems 
Research (Jena) and for Physics of Complex Systems (Dresden). 
  In the final stage, there should be 15 to 20 institutes in 
the east part of Germany. A density will thereby have been 
reached which is comparable to that in the old states, now with 
65 institutes and independent research groups.

  [Text]In Saxony they are trying to make a virtue of 
necessity. Businesses willing to settle in the rural districts 
of Floeha, Mittweida, and Zschopau can, for a limited time, make 
use of the manpower of unemployed scientists and engineers at no 
cost to themselves. In return, the small and mid-size firms must 
commit themselves to creating jobs in the region after a given 
period of time. The project is not without controversy. The 
Saxon FDP [Free Democratic Party] is afraid of government 
subsidized competition for research firms in the private sector. 
  Regions near Chemnitz are marked by the decline in the once 
dominant textile industry. After reunification, only a fraction 
of the jobs in this area of business could be salvaged. 
Manufacturing companies are still in short supply. Peter Daetz, 
Director of the Center for Economic Development and Advanced 
Training GmbH (CEDAT) in Floeha, made the point that "during the 
recession, we couldn't get anyone to settle here." Three rural 
districts of Saxony and the state of Saxony are partners in the 
non-profit CEDAT, which concerns itself with promoting economic 
development and a second labor market. 
  In spite of enterprise zones, low real estate prices and 
development programs, there was no apparent successful influx of 
people into the structurally weak area. When the Technical 
University of Chemnitz-Zwichau had to let almost 1,000 
scientists and engineers go at the end of 1992, the promoters of 
economic development got the idea to offer this potential in 
research and development (R&amp;D) at no cost to regional 
companies, 
to those establishing new business enterprises, and to investors 
from West. 
  The following model served: If a company, at no cost to 
itself, employs the services of a scientist for one year, it is 
obligated afterward to create two to three secure jobs in the 
region. Breach of this commitment results in the threat of 
contractual penalties. This measure of creating work is financed 
according to 249h of the Employment Promotion Act. There are 
currently 150 scientists and engineers available for this 
undertaking. "Since R&amp;D work is not being done for money, we 
are 
not giving any competition to private research companies," Daetz 
emphasizes. Representatives of Chambers of Industry and Commerce 
should guard against jobs eluding private companies. 
  The measures are handled institutionally by the Assistance 
Center of Middle Saxony (ACMS). Members are the CEDAT, the 
State, the Construction Company of Saxony, the District Savings 
Bank as well as the municipality of Floeha. Up to now the ACMS 
has been able to conclude ten contracts with companies, which 
created 60 secure jobs. By the end of 1994 the number should 
climb to 200. Without the R&amp;D offer, these companies would 
never 
have come to Saxony-- Daetz is certain of that. The FDP of 
Saxony is not sympathetic to the ACMS also getting government 
support. Around 10 million German marks are at the disposal of 
the ACMS for two years.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Rhone-Poulenc Is Considering Different </F>
Rare Earths Production Methods to Solve Waste Problems"] 
  [Text] Paris--Rhone-Poulenc announced on 6 December that it 
is considering producing its rare earths from bastnaesite, an 
ore purchased and preprocessed in China and the United States, 
instead of the monazite presently imported from Australia and 
whose residues create storage problems. 
  The fabrication of rare earths (15 chemical elements) from 
monazite generates residues with low radioactivity. This waste 
has been stored for the past twenty years at a specialized site 
in the Manche, but it reached saturation capacity in 1991 and 
Rhone-Poulenc had three years to find another solution. 
  The chemical group had considered storing the waste at the 
site of a former uranium extracting plant at Ecarpiere (Vendee), 
which raised strong local opposition. Lacking authorization for 
this site, and with "no storage solution found at the national 
level," Rhone-Poulenc is thinking about simply switching to 
bastnaesite for its supply. 
  This substitution implies shutting down the ore 
preprocessing 
plant at La Rochelle (Charente-Maritime) in September 1994, 
involving 65 jobs out of a plant total of 500. The decision 
however is not expected to cause any job losses as the employees 
will be reassigned at the site. 
  Rhone-Poulenc is the world's main producer of extracted rare 
earths, with 20 percent of the world's volume (36 percent in 
terms of value), ahead of the American Molycorp, the Japanese 
Santoku, and Chinese manufacturers. The group notably holds 65 
percent of the world market for rare earths used in catalytic 
converters for automobiles. Rare earths are also used in 
luminescent applications (notably television screens), 
electronics, and magnetic applications (audio recording heads, 
magnets, scanners), and optics.

<F P=106> [Article by JB: "More Effective Waste Water Treatment With </F>
the Biogas Tower Reactor"] 
  [Text] Anaerobic biotechnical waste water treatment in 
bioreactors is today already being used by the food industry, 
pulp production, and paper manufacturing companies. The field of 
bioprocessing technology at the Hamburg-Harburg Technical 
University (Professor Herbert Maerkl, Denickestrasse 15, 21071, 
Hamburg) has now, in cooperation with Preussag Noell 
Wassertechnik GmbH, developed a new type of bioreactor concept 
for increasing the decomposition effects. 
  As reported by Maerkl, anaerobic biotechnical cleaning 
methods are generally held to be less effective than aerobic 
ones. This is due to the slow rate of growth of the anaerobic 
microorganisms. However, the decomposition effects per gram of 
biomass are comparable to those of aerobic microbes. For that 
reason, if it is possible to increase the biomass in the 
reactor, anaerobic methods are also very effective. This 
increase has been achieved with the biogas tower reactor from 
Hamburg by using the sludge bed process. Another problem with 
anaerobic bioreactors is transferring the generated biogas to 
the outside. Gas production can be so high that disposal is 
impossible to deal with or would lead to a loss of biomass 
through flotation. This problem is also solved by the tower 
reactor. Gas suction equipment has been built into the reactor 
container at various heights. This makes it possible to dispose 
of gas even at low levels. Technically, the suction equipment 
works by adding pockets in the form of sloping metal sheets in 
the reactor volume. They partition the reactor into several 
compartments connected with each other and catch the rising 
biogas. The gas bubble formed under the sheet can be drawn off 
through a vent placed there. By regulating the gas extraction at 
the various heights, it is possible to regulate the gas content 
so as to be uniform throughout the reactor. But the gas bubble 
under the pockets has other advantages as well. By means of the 
free surfaces formed on the liquid, floating biomass particles 
are also kept down. Therefore, the gas extraction is possible 
without loss of biomass. The pockets can also help when mixing 
the reactor content. It is important for the decomposition 
effect that the microorganisms and the added waste water are as 
evenly distributed as possible. Since some microbes live in the 
form of symbiotic agglomerates, this blending must have as 
little gravitational force as possible. This problem is 
elegantly solved in the biogas tower reactor. 
  If the gas under the pockets is not removed, it continues to 
rise upward over an overflow edge. Through built-in flow 
channels this creates a circulating flow in the liquid. It can 
be controlled by the level of gas removal. In this way various 
blending intensities can be regulated in the various 
compartments of the reactor. The requirement to achieve good 
blending in the lower reactor areas and a high storage capacity 
for the biomass in the higher areas is easily met. By properly 
regulating the blending, the inhibiting effect of hydrogen 
sulfide, which is created from sulfate in the waste water, can 
also be reduced. 
  At this time a 20-meter-high reactor with a diameter of one 
meter is being operated as a pilot facility. It has turned out 
to be successful in treating yeast waste water.

<F P=106> [Article by Georg C. Goy of the General Directorate for </F>
Energy (DG XVII), European Communities Commission, THERMIE, 
Brussels: "THERMIE: EC Aid for Nonnuclear Energy Technologies; 
Small and Medium-Sized Companies Given Preference; Goals Are 
Energy Conservation and CO2 Reduction"] 
  [Text] 
HANDELSBLATT-TL, 23 Nov--For more than 15 years now the EC has 
been providing aid for the development, demonstration, and, 
lastly, also the first steps in introducing new, innovative, and 
efficient energy technologies on the market in Europe. In the 
process, almost 3,000 projects have so far been financially 
supported by the EC with a total of about 1.9 billion ECU 
[European currency units], initially through various 
demonstration programs and since 1990 through the new THERMIE 
(Energy Technology for Energy Control) program. 
  The THERMIE program (EEC Council Decree No. 2008/90, ABL No. 
185 of 17 July 1990) is designed for the five-year period, 
1990-1994, and thus ends next year. It is provided with an 
average volume of about 700 million ECU; that is, about 150-170 
million ECU a year are available to promote nonnuclear energy 
technologies in the member countries. 
  The current debate in the Commission and the Council of 
Ministers on the inclusion of a successor tto the THERMIE 
program in the EC's fourth general research program and the 
effects of the budget in connection with it will decide what 
sort of role aid for energy technologies will assume within the 
Community area in the future and also, based on it, to a greater 
extent in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe bordering 
on the EC as well as the countries bordering on the 
Mediterranean. 
  THERMIE concentrates on three main areas: 


    -  Financial support for projects that promote innovative 
energy technologies that are ready for application; 
  -  Measures for the introduction into the market and deployment 
of 
new energy technologies; 
  -  Coordination of EC-wide as well as national, regional, and 
local activities in this field. 

    The THERMIE program enables the EC to provide financial 
support for: 
  a) innovative projects: These projects are 
expected to develop new kinds of technologies, methods, or 
products (TMP) for which the research and development stage has 
been essentially completed to the point of readiness for 
application and to promote new kinds of applications for already 
known TMP. This type of project is expected to prove the 
technical and economic viability of new technologies by means of 
an initial production run on a sufficiently large scale. 
  b) dissemination projects: The goal of these 
projects is to promote innovative TMP that have already 
undergone an initial production run, but which, because of 
ongoing risks, it has hitherto not yet been possible to 
successfully market and for which there are now really good 
chances of their wider application in the Community, whether it 
be under other economic or geographical conditions or with the 
aid of different technical versions. 
  c) targeted projects: If the Commission considers 
it necessary and has identified an unfilled public need, that 
is, significant technological advances are to be anticipated 
through cooperation between persons or firms from at least two 
member countries, the implementation of special projects, which 
must be oriented in terms of the Commission's detailed 
specifications, may be sponsored on the initiative of the 
Commission, that is, their coordination may be financially 
supported (so-called "targeted projects"). 
<H5>  Aid for Projects and Accompanying Measures </H5>
  The THERMIE program covers all nonnuclear energy 
technologies 
that can make innovative contributions in the sectors: 


    -  Energy conservation, that is, efficient use of energy, 
specifically in the subsectors: - buildings, - industry, - the 
energy industry, - transport and communications; 
  -  New and renewable sources of energy in the subsectors: - 
photovoltaics, - solar energy, - biomass, - geothermy, - small 
hydroelectric power plants, - wind energy; 
  -  Solid fuels, and; 
  -  Hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas). 

    About 85 percent of the funds is earmarked for direct 
project 
aid and about 15 percent for "accompanying measures." The aid is 
provided in the form of a direct subsidy which does not have to 
be repaid even if the project is a commercial success, 
specifically, up to 40 percent of the costs that qualify for 
subsidization for innovative and "targeted" projects and up to 
35 percent for dissemination projects. 
  The projects are to be implemented within the confines of 
the 
Community, but there may be exceptions. In any case, safety 
provisions and those relevant to the environment in effect at 
any given time must be complied with. When the cost of a project 
exceeds an investment figure of 6 million ECU, the applicants 
from at least two member countries must come to document the 
European dimension of the project. Furthermore, while, of 
course, basic technical feasibility and marketability of the 
technologies are required, there must also be difficulties in 
financing because of technical and/or economic risks in 
realizing the projects for which subsidies are applied for to 
obtain aid. 
  Projects that materialize through the collaboration of firms 
from several member countries, are to be implemented by small 
and medium-sized companies, and/or are established in 
economically less developed regions of the Community are given 
preference. The more of these criteria the applicant meets, the 
more chance he has of influencing the success rate of 1:4 
(selected versus applied-for projects) in his favor. 
  This is to be viewed as a reform of the present program 
vis-a-vis its predecessors in that support for efficient energy 
technologies is not limited to only those projects that have 
already been subsidized by the EC. But rather THERMIE also 
provides aid for the introduction into the market of 
technologies that have already been readied for market as part 
of national or other public programs as well as by industry 
alone, that is, without any public subsidy. 
  The "accompanying measures" that are included in the THERMIE 
program as an additional reform are expected to in particular 
see to the dissemination of the results of the projects or 
reports on the respective technologies. They may not 
discriminate against any firm, but are available largely free of 
charge to interested parties as a service of the program and to 
improve market openness. 
  The most important tasks, which are covered by the 
organizations for the promotion of energy technologies, the 
so-called OPETS, set up to take care of them, apply to: 


    -  The effecting of market studes as well as analyses of 
the chances of introducing innovative energy technologies and 
studies of the effects of environmental policy during 
on-the-spot operation as well as the importance of regional 
policy for them, and more besides, 
  -  The dissemination of reports on the projects and technologies 
through the collection, editing, and preparation of 
informational material (brochures, leaflets, technical reports, 
translations into the language of the country); the organization 
of and participation in appropriate events, seminars, and 
conferences; the organization of project tours for, for example, 
journalists and interested parties from inside and outside the 
country; and the development and maintenance of data banks 
(Sesame, etc.). 
  -  The construction of tranfer points (public and private) at 
local, regional, or national levels. 

    In selecting these OPETS, of which there are, at present, 40 
throughout Europe, the Commission chose a decentralized approach 
that could fall back on individual organizations specializing in 
energy sectors in the member countries. They form a network of 
private firms (in many cases engineer's offices), professional 
organizaitons, public (energy) agencies and institutes that are 
active on regional or national levels and can if necessary fall 
back on a potential total of about 3,000 energy experts. 
  These OPETS receive financial support form the Commission 
for 
their cooperation in the amount of from 13 to 15 million ECU a 
year to carry out 200 actions within the framework of the 
THERMIE program. 
  In addition, with the Commission's decision of December 
1991, 
some OPETS were commissioned to establish so-called EC energy 
centers in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and to 
coordinate their activities. To date 14 energy centers in 
national or regional capitals of the former CEMA have launched 
their activities. Their job consists of in particular 
facilitating and promoting the transfer of knowledge and 
technology between the European Community and these countries. 
  Each of these centers is headed by a director appointed by 
the Commission who is supported by a local representative, a 
number of energy experts, and the necessary administrative 
personnel. In addition, if necessary energy experts from the 
member countries are also employed in them for certain missions 
subject to time limits. 
<H5>  Priming for Reproductions </H5>
  Recent analyses commissioned by the Commission and conducted 
by independent experts prove that energy savings of or an 
energyproduction amounting to 1.5 million tons of crude oil 
units (ROeE) could be obtained with the help of the THERMIE 
program and its predecessors through the projects themselves 
(first application), and especially, of course, in the areas of 
efficient use of energy and exploitation of renewable sources of 
energy. This amounts to 0.2 percent of the EC's energy needs. 
  If we consider how the EC intends to allocate funds for 
this, 
namely by providing strong support through the THERMIE program, 
especially for all technologies for which a great potential for 
reproduction can be presumed, we get a more impressive picture 
of the situation. if we include those reproductions of 
successfully completed EC projects that have to date already 
been launched and are yet to be anticipated with a high degree 
of probability, up to 18 million tons of ROeE--and, if the at 
this time known potential for these energy technologies is fully 
exhausted, theoretically even as much as 120 million tons of 
ROeE--a year can be saved or replaced with the aid of renewable 
sources of energy throughout all of Europe. In the process, 
CO&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  emissions in the EC could at the same time be 
reduced by as much as 15 percent and, of course, be applied to 
the current level of about 3 billion tons of CO&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; 
emissions in the EC. An achievement, therefore, that would have 
to make people sit up and take notice if we bear in mind the 
EC's goal of stabilizing CO&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  emissions in the 
Community at the 1990 level by the year 2000. 
  Realistically viewed, however, we have to assume that this 
potential would only have a chance of coming to nearly full 
fruition with extraordinary efforts on the part of all those 
involved and substantially more favorable background conditions, 
which could benefit these energy technologies in, for example, 
the form of a constantly rising energy price level as they 
penetrate the market. Increased efforts are also necessary in 
areas other than immediate support for projects only insofar as 
they offer a realistic chance of attaining reduction targets as 
concerns CO2 emissions through combined action.

Bonn, under the rubric "Course of Technology": "Wind Energy/New 
Technology Improves Availability/1200 MW by Year 2000. 
Government Subsidies Causing Flood of Applications to the 
Federal Research Ministry to Grow"; first paragraph is an 
introduction] 
  [Text] 23 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT-TL)--The coastal areas of 
Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein blessed with a strong breeze 
want to cover, via ambitious subsidy programs, around five 
percent of their electric power demand by means of wind power by 
the year 2000. The construction of 8000 installations is planned 
in Lower Saxony alone. That such goals can be attained is 
definitely confirmed by a study prepared at the request of the 
Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT), that was to 
find out what contribution wind energy can make to the Federal 
Republic of Germany's energy supply in the next 10 to 15 years. 
  The authors' intent was to provide a picture as close to 
reality as possible. Therefore they investigated, in addition to 
the technical assumptions and economic factors, also whether 
financial backers were prepared to invest in wind power, whether 
the manufacturers of wind power units are able to meet the 
growing demand besides, and whether the today still tedious 
licensing process could slow development. 
  In addition, they investigated whether easy integration into 
the local power system would be ensured for areas having a 
favorable wind situation. Besides, they had to be outside 
wildlife sanctuaries and nature preserves in order to be 
included in the study at all. Wooded areas were also excluded, 
because, in the authors' opinion, the gain obtained by the 
exploitation of wind energy does not compensate for the loss 
that occurs by the clearing of forests. Taking all these factors 
into account, the study's conclusion is that it is possible to 
expect that in the year 2000 all the wind power installations in 
Germany together could generate approximately the power of a 
nuclear power plant (around 1200 MW). 
  However, without government subsidies it will go far worse 
for the future of wind power. At present the federal research 
ministry is administering the republic's largest subsidy 
program, the so-called 250-megawatt program, that grants 
operators of wind power installations an operating cost subsidy 
for a term of about 10 years, or optionally a one-time 
investment subsidy. The ministry has been struggling with a 
veritable flood of applications since in 1991, through an 
amendment to the electric power supply legislation, it became 
substantially more attractive for private operators to deliver 
to electric power companies electricity that they do not consume 
themselves. 
<H5>  Climate Tax Could Spur Wind Wheels On </H5>
  However, the funds are limited because the program was 
established exclusively for research purposes. Facilities are 
being subsidized up to a total capacity of 250 MW, 120 MW of 
which are already in service, and BMFT has applications already 
today for an additional 1129 MW. However, the Federal Ministry 
of Economics would then be in charge of subsidy programs that 
exceed this scope. 
  Only the state programs of Lower Saxony and 
Schleswig-Holstein, that want to subsidize 2000 MW and 1000 MW 
respectively by the year 2000, offer substantial prospects. 
Accordingly the new states could be placed at a disadvantage 
when the federal republic's subsidy money runs out. Sixty-eight 
wind power installations having a total capacity of 11 MW have 
been erected there since 1990. This represents about five 
percent of the total wind energy capacity installed in Germany. 
This percentage can be increased to 20 percent by the year 2000, 
the authors of the study say. 
  Admittedly, the direct government subsidizing of wind power 
could become unnecessary with the introduction of the debated 
carbon dioxide tax. Because the construction of wind power 
installations is very costly, the use of wind energy because of 
an increase in the price of electricity would be substantially 
more economical. However, the introduction of the carbon dioxide 
tax will still fail because of the differing interests of 
several member countries of the European Union (EU). Therefore, 
the federal government is now considering the introduction of an 
energy tax at the national level. 
  Wolfgang Mayer's study published by Resch Verlag 
[Publishers] 
in 1992 under the title "Exploitation of Wind Energy in 
Germany," however, does not take into account the contribution 
technical advances could make toward the economic efficiency of 
wind power. In this connection, Graduate Engineer Aloys Wobben 
of the Enercon company in Wilhelmshafen recently presented the 
latest developments in this field at a Eurosolar show in Bonn. 
  In the meantime the company's first 300-kilowatt facility 
has 
been freed of several repair-prone and thereby expensive 
components. So, gears and linkages are unnecessary, because the 
rotor blades now transmit their mechanical energy directly to 
the electricity-producing generator. Therefore the facilities 
can be built substantially more inexpensively. In Wobben's 
opinion the wind power units' technical development is still far 
from complete. He admits great prospects for a unit, developed 
within the EC's Wega-2 program, that has a capacity of one 
megawatt and is to come onto the market in 1995. Besides, 
technical innovations could result in the fact that locations in 
the interior also will be more attractive in the future. 
  But not even wind energy can fulfill the dream of a form of 
energy without any influence on the environment. Wind power 
installations can have a lasting influence on the migratory 
behavior of some species of birds. The birds shun their vicinity 
when looking for suitable resting places. They are a problem 
above all in proximity to dikes, because migratory birds use the 
dikes as orientation points. "We are for wind energy because we 
do not want to exchange nature conservation for environmental 
protection," says a supporter of the German Nature Conservation 
Alliance. However, the legislature's measures, like the 
guidelines for the erection of wind power units prepared by the 
Lower Saxony environment ministry, for example, have often not 
been sufficient. The protection of additional areas is necessary 
so that the "achievements in environmental protection do not" 
bring in their train "losses in nature conservation." To this 
aim the BMFT study also calls for further studies of the 
possible effects on the animal world of the use of wind power.

ABBKraftwerke AG [Asea Brown Boveri Power Plants German Stock 
Corporation],responsible for the gas turbine and combined-cycle 
power plant divisionin Mannheim, under the rubric "Course of 
Technology": "Gas Turbines/KeyComponents for Efficiency of 
Combined-Cycle Power Plants/Output of 240MW Reached. Reheating 
Produces Maximum Efficiency"; first paragraph isan introduction] 
  [Text] 23 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT-TL)--So-called 
combined-cycle powerplants presently offer the most efficient 
technology for the considerate-of-the-environment "conversion to 
energy" of fossil fuels. Plants presently in service are today 
achieving efficiency of about 53 percent. An international team 
of ABB engineers has now succeeded, by means of a new kind of 
gas turbine design, in around two years ofdevelopment work, in 
markedly pushing up the previous optimum value forcombined-cycle 
plants. The thermal efficiency of the new gas turbines (the 
ratio of the input fuel energy to the effective output) is 38 
percent in solo operation and reaches over 58 percent in the 
combined-cycle process. This means anaround 10 percent lowering 
of specific fuel costs. Carbon dioxide emissions are reduced to 
the same extent. The most powerful version of Th)0*0*0*00T the 
new turbine generation (type GT26) attains 240 MW and 
accordinglyhas to be the most powerful gas turbine in the world 
at present. A 165-MW version is being offered for the 60-Hz 
market. The gas turbine is the key component of a combined-cycle 
power plant: In the gas-steam process, an approximately 
1200-degree-Celsius hot compressed fuel-air mixture leaves the 
combustion chamber and sets the gas turbine rotating, which 
generates electrical energy in a coupled generator. Steam is 
generated by the over 600-degree-Celsius hot exhaust gases in a 
downstream waste-heat boiler, and this steam in turn impels the 
steam turbine. While the steam turbine process has largely been 
exhausted technicallytoday, gas turbines still offer potential 
for development. While the efficiency of a gas turbine--of the 
then BBC installed in 1939 in Neuchatel in Switzerland--was 
around 15 percent, the most powerful of the turbines in service 
today reaches around 35 percent. The reason: Thanks to new kinds 
of materials and optimized blade and vane cooling, in the 
decades that have gone by, turbine inlet temperatures have been 
able to be raised from around 800 degrees to over 1200 degrees 
Celsius. Improvements are possible, even yet, by raising the 
inlet temperature further. However, substantial outlays have to 
be made for this that would result in only fractions of a 
percentage point. Therefore, the engineers at ABB banked 
alternatively on higher compression and two-stage combustion 
instead of on higher temperatures. The principal component of 
the new design is a multistage combustion chamber--the term 
sequential combustion is also used--in which the more highly 
compressed air is utilized twice in two turbine stages. Two 
combustion chambers are connected in series for this "reheating 
technology." The air drawn in leaves the compressor at about 30 
bars (double the norm thus far in power plant turbines) and is 
swirled intensively with the fuel and ignited in the combustion 
chamber of the high-pressure stage, and drives the single-stage 
high-pressure-component turbine. So-called low-NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt; 
burners get to be used here. The cooled, expanded, but still 
oxygen-rich mixture is led into the low-pressure combustion 
chamber, which operates with similar burner equipment. There 
fuel is again supplied and swirled and the mixture is ignited 
automatically and drives the low-pressure turbine stages. The 
pressure ratios are in keeping with those of conventional gas 
turbines (15 bars). An especially lean fuel-air mixture having a 
very high percentage of oxygen is burned in the first annular 
combustion chamber. The first turbine stage consumes 
approximately 60 percent of the total fuel required. The air for 
combustion is compressed beforehand in a 30-to-1 ratio in the 
compressor by the 22 flow-optimized compressor stages and 
arrives at the low-NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  burners through airflow 
ducts. There the compressed air is mixed with precisely measured 
quantities of fuel into an intensively swirling stream before 
the fuel-air mixture ignitesin the combustion chamber.The 
especially intensive swirling of the fuel-air mixture is 
achieved by means of the offset conical half-shells of the 
burners. The special geometry ensures steady independently 
"standing" flames in front of the burner members. A total of 30 
of these low-NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  burners are distributed uniformly 
over the annular combustion chamber's circumference. Their 
simple design, in combination with the uniform distribution of 
the flames, reduces thermal stresses both in the combustion 
chamber and in the turbine. After ignition, the combustion gases 
flow through the single-stage high-pressure turbine and release 
part of their energy here before they are led further into the 
low-pressure combustion chamber. Advanced blade and vane cooling 
and the especially uniform temperature distribution--resulting 
from this annular combustion chamber's geometry--ensure the long 
life of the high-pressure turbine stage. In the second 
combustion chamber stage too, the still oxygen-rich combustion 
gases are led into premix gas burners that operate according to 
the same principle as the burners in the high-pressure section. 
The air is mixed intensively with the remaining fuel (about 40 
percent). Here too no small flame retention baffles or similar 
components are required that are subject to heavy wear. This 
contributes to the machines' high availability and lowers 
maintenance costs. The cooling air is used in the combustion 
chambers almost totally as preheated air for combustion, so that 
cooling and efficiency are optimized equally. The long design of 
the second combustion chamber aids chemicalNO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt; 
reduction: A great part of the nitrogen oxides transported by 
the combustion gases is eliminated in the second 
stage.Advanced-design gas turbines and combined-cycle power 
plants have to demonstrate both excellent full-load values and 
good partial-load behavior. The advantages of multistage 
combustion chambers, relating to their design, have their full 
effect here. For one thing, only the first turbine [as written] 
stage is ignited at start-up. When quarterload is reached, the 
combustion gases from the high-pressure section have the 
temperature at which the second combustion chamber can be 
ignited and slowly flared up. The low-pressure-section turbine 
is consequently slowly heated when the machines start. The 
maximum turbine inlet temperature is reached not until full load 
here, but at quarter load in the high-pressure turbine. 
Controllable compressor stages aid steady partial-load behavior. 
No switching process or control action whatsoever are required 
during start-up. Besides, this technology involves the 
capability of using oil as fuel if gas is not available, with 
comparable output data.The design offers additional advantages 
besides a substantial achievement leap in efficiency: Because 
the turbine inlet temperature was raised only slightly 
considering the turbine, the engineers were able to fall back on 
known materials and proven processes. The substantial 
improvements in the matters of energy conversion and emission 
characteristics were realized by intelligently combining already 
proven techniques. The higher compression in the first turbine 
stage enables high specific output with a compact design. Thus, 
with this design one achieves power density not previously 
considered possible, and the mechanical loading of rotating 
parts is also relatively low. And the environment benefits too: 
Compared with a conventional gas turbine (efficiency of around 
34.5 percent), gas consumption is reducedby 33,000 tons per year 
in 6000 hours of operation, and 90,000 tons of the greenhouse 
gas carbon dioxide do not form at all. The lower fuel costs 
contrast with comparable investment costs per megawatt. There is 
still development potential remaining because of the 
disassociation of turbine inlet temperature and efficiency. An 
order has already come in from the United States: The Jersey 
CentralPower &amp; Light Company ordered the sister model the GT 
24, 
designed for the 60-Hz market. This turbine, which has an output 
of 165 MW, is to go into service in July 1996. The researchers 
in their work were able to build on know-how in multistage 
combustion chambers and two-stage gas turbines gained by the 
engineers of the former BBC: Engineers at the Beznau power 
station in Switzerland implemented as early as 1948 a 
similar--though technologically very extravagant--two-shaft 
design. A total of 25 such units were installed, having outputs 
of between 20 and 25 MW. And a single-shaft two-stage unit 
having two silo-type [large diameter] combustion chambers 
connected in series was implemented in 1978 at the 290-MW 
Huntorf air storage gas turbine power plant northwest of Bremen. 
The Huntorf power plant is still in service today, just as are 
nine two-shaft units.

<F P=106> [Article by Wg: "Horizontal Drilling and `Frac' at Nearly </F>
5,000 Meters' Depth"] 
  [Text] Celle--For the first time in Germany, the technology 
of horizontal drilling, combined with multiple hydraulic 
fracturing of deposit rock at a depth of almost 5,000 meters is 
being used for a natural gas drilling project. As reported by 
Mobil Erdgas-Erdoel GmbH, the operator for a consortium, work is 
beginning in the next few days on the Soehlingen Z-10 project in 
northern Lower Saxony, in the vicinity of Rotenburg (Wuemme). 
  The goal of this technically innovative, expensive method is 
profitably to exploit a natural gas deposit with extremely thick 
rock and correspondingly low penetrability. In the event the 
project should be successful, this combination of two techniques 
would open up new prospects for natural gas exploitation in 
Germany. 
  At the Soehlingen gas field a 1,000-meter-long horizontal 
stretch is being drilled and equipped with pipe at a depth of 
4,800 meters in the approximately 100-meter-thick main sand of 
the new red conglomerate geological formation. Along this 
stretch, at intervals of 200 meters, vertical, about 
15-millimeter wide cracks will be produced. They are made by 
squeezing in a special fluid under extremely high pressure 
("multiple hydraulic fracturing"). 
  The cracks stretch in elliptical form about 200 meters 
horizontally and 100 meters vertically into the rock at the 
deposit. In order for the cracks not to close up again after 
this so-called "frac" treatment, high-tensile ceramic sand is 
pressed in along with the fluid, which remains as support in the 
cracks and keeps them permanently open. 
  The combination of horizontal drilling process and multiple 
fracturing of the rock is to produce clearly better "drainage" 
and thus enable satisfactory production rates. Horizontal 
drilling and "frac" methods are basically known techniques, but 
what is new is their combined application based on a difficult 
initial situation, which is marked by great depth, high 
pressures, and temperatures as well as the extremely low 
penetrability of the rock. 
  Heavy drilling equipment from Itag Tiefbohr GmbH is being 
used, with a special drive unit. The bore hole will be a total 
of 6,100 meters deep. The drilling time is expected to be about 
six months. The subsequent work operations will take another one 
and a half months. 
  With the new combination of techniques, the companies 
involved--BEB Erdgas and Erdoel GmbH (30 percent), RWE-DEA AG 
(30 percent), Wintershall AG (10 percent) and Mobil 
Erdgas-Erdoel GmbH as drilling and mining operators (30 
percent)--expect profitably to develop a large proportion of the 
already proven natural gas content in the deposit.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Flight Reaction Indicates </F>
Impurities--Berlin Testing Procedure Uses Ciliates for Detecting 
Toxicologic Substances"] 
  [Text] Ciliates can detect and avoid toxic substances. This 
behavior called chemotaxis can be used for the detection of 
toxic substances in contaminated water. Based on this 
observation, scientists at the Free University of Berlin 
(Institut fuer Biochemie, AG Oekotoxikologie, E hrenbergstr. 
26-28, 14195 Berlin) developed a testing system for toxic 
compounds dissolved in water. Preliminary studies showed that 
the system containing the ciliate tetrahymena thermophilia is 
versatile and sensitive. 
  As the scientists in Berlin report, the toxic substances 
cause typical flight and evasive actions. The extent of the 
reaction depends on the substance concentration. Tetrahymenia is 
suitable as a testing organism because it is an intermediate 
step between bacteria and higher organisms, both biologically 
and ecologically. It plays an important role in the food chains 
in water. The biochemistry and physiology of the organism has 
been studied thoroughly. 
  The ciliate is used in three different test formats in 
Berlin. The testing apparatus basically consists of an outer 
chamber, into which an internal chamber consisting of 18 
measuring tubes is inserted. The measuring tubes are connected 
with the outer chamber by fine channels. 
  In the initial test phase, the organisms are in the outer 
chamber. The test sample is in the measuring tubes. If they 
contain toxic substances, the ciliates avoid the tubes, 
otherwise they spread to both chambers. The measured value is 
the number of organisms which entered the tubes. 
  Another test measures how the growth of tetrahymena is 
inhibited when agents are added. However, this test is 
considerably less sensitive than the chemosensory test. The 
change in the membrane potential due to water contamination can 
be studied using fluorescent compounds; the sensitivity of this 
test is supposed to be similar to that of the chemosensory 
process. 
  In studies with chemical substances, which were selected 
randomly from the "European Inventory of Existing Chemicals", 
the test had a broad range and high sensitivity. However, the 
method is not suitable for continuous monitoring of the water 
quality.

  [TEXT]By the end of 1992, there were 1,200 wind power 
installations in Germany. Rated output: 180 MW. Since 1974, the 
Federal Ministry for Research and Technology [FMRT] has promoted 
the use of wind energy, about 30 million marks are made 
available for this purpose annually. This makes a total of about 
300 million German marks thus far--120 marks for large and 100 
for small and mid-size installations, the remainder for R&amp;D 
projects. Goals: acceptable costs for energy production with 
wind power, a noticeable contribution to the supply of 
electricity, reduction in energy imports, a broadening of the 
foundation of the energy supply, and a search for alternatives 
for the Third World. Through continued development in the 
technology of wind power installation, wind power generated 
current should become competitive by the end of the millennium. 
  Improvement in the technical availability of wind power 
installations is at the heart of the federal promotional program 
offered by the FMRT since 1989--"250 MW Wind". A good half of 
the installations within the scope of this program are operated 
by commercial enterprises, 30&percnt; by private investors, 
almost 
15&percnt; by farmers, and 3.5&percnt; by local authorities and 
associations. Together with a scientific measurement and 
evaluation program (SMEP), the data from the promoted 
installations will be collected for ten years and evaluated. As 
an incentive for their participation in the general test, 
operators of the windmills will receive from the FMRT a subsidy 
of six to eight pfennigs per kWh, plus 16.6 pfennigs for wind 
power generated current. Because of this promotional program, in 
1992 growth in wind power installations was for the first time 
greater in Germany than in Denmark, the European leader (320 MW 
from nearly 2,300 installations). Worldwide about 2,300 MW are 
currently generated by from wind power. The USA has 15,000 wind 
installations with 1,600 MW in operation. In the EC countries 
the wind capacity is currently about 1,000 MW. The EC 
demonstration program THERMIE--which runs from 1991 to 
1994--places emphasis on those energy technologies which would 
counteract the looming greenhouse effect through a reduction in 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions. It is supposed to promote the market 
introduction of improved energy technologies and encourage 
cooperation across national borders. The energy research program 
JOULE II (Joint Opportunities for Unconventional or Long Term 
Energy Supply) also runs until the end of 1994. Within the scope 
of this program, a new generation of large wind turbines of 
optimal size and technology is supposed to be developed. Seven 
projects, two of them German, have gearless 1 MW installations 
as their goal.

  [TEXT] In seven years, Germany intends to be getting 2,000 
megawatts of electricity from wind power, more than ten times 
today's level. To manage this increase, more facilities must be 
built in the interior of the country. 
  For mountain enthusiasts, the Hirtstein is a thoroughly 
insignificant hill in the Erz Mountains. In contrast, Dr. 
Wolfgang Daniels, Director of the Dresden firm of SachsenKraft 
GmbH, perceives a milestone in the hill. Not only are the first 
wind energy installations of Saxony there. But for the first 
time in Germany, after trials in the Eifel, a privately run wind 
field was developed on the crest of a low mountain range. 
  Connected to the power supply grid a good year ago, the 
mills 
already provide two million kilowatt hours--more than the 750 
inhabitants in neighboring Satzung can use. Wind power could 
admittedly play a much greater roll in Saxony. Wolfgang Daniels, 
together with the Dresden engineering firm of Joerg Kuntzsch 
&amp; 
Partner, co-initiator of the Hirtstein wind field, worked out a 
wind atlas for the free state (publication date: March 1994). 
  Wind Fields In the neighborhood of the Hirtstein 
alone, 12 additional wind fields could be established. Four 
projects are actually already in the planning and authorization 
stages; among them are those at the Oberwiesenthal border and in 
Joehstadt, where installations with a total rated output of 3.5 
MW are to be erected. 
  "Naturally it is not our goal to plaster the upper Erz 
Mountains nature preserve with modern windmills," says Wolfgang 
Daniels to ward off objections. But there, where it is possible 
and economically sensible, the mountain wind should be used to 
produce clean energy. Decentralized wind power installations 
could, according to Daniels, meet up to 50&percnt; of the 
electric 
power needs in some administrative districts in the Erz 
Mountains. Saxony's Minister of the Environment Arnold Vaatz 
even considers half the state to be suitable. 
  Without opening up new regions of the interior to wind 
energy, the goal of the Federal Ministry for Research and 
Technology cannot in any case be achieved. According to 
assertions from Bonn, the 2,000 MW limit should be reached in 
the year 2,000. Wind energy would then still only come to a 
modest 0.2 to 0.4&percnt; of the electric power produced in 
Germany 
today. Still, that would mean an annual reduction in 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions of around four million metric tons. 
<H5>  Oekostrom Project in Saxony: Windmills On the Hirtstein. </H5>
  Germany's neighbor to the north, Denmark--the world market 
leader in the business of wind energy--is much further along. 
Finn Hasted, certified engineer and Director at Elkraft, the 
Danish producer of energy installations, knows that by the turn 
of the century 2.5&percnt; of the country's electricity needs 
should 
be met by windmills. The Danes are increasingly going into the 
ocean--they are even already experimenting with 1 MW off-shore 
installations. 
  In order for Germany to make progress in the business of 
wind 
energy, it is especially important, according to Bernd Neumann, 
the Undersecretary of State in the Federal Ministry for Research 
and Technology (FMRT), to further reduce the costs of energy 
production from wind installations. Even without government 
promotional measures--the FMRT development program is to expire 
in 1995--they must become competitive. Because of the high cost 
of the installations, wind energy today still costs, relative to 
the kilowatt hour, up to five times as much as conventionally 
produced electricity. 
  Promotional rates and conditions for the installations 
costing between 1,000 German marks (rated output: 0.07 kW) to 
1.5 million German marks (600-800 kW)--almost 100 types are 
available on the market--have until now varied greatly from 
state to state. Dr. Daniels is also skeptical then regarding the 
effectiveness of federal promotional politics: "It doesn't lead 
to any real introduction into the market." Getting on the market 
is also hampered by the slow process of obtaining authorization 
and by resistance on the part of public utilities to the 
unwelcome competition from private wind power operators. 
Although obligated for more than a year by the energy supply law 
to pay producers 16.53 pfennigs per kilowatt hour, the public 
utilities continue to try to push down the price; or they pay, 
but slowly. 
  Wind power installations in the interior, according to 
Daniel's counterproposal, should in general be compensated by 
150 percent of the avenge end-user price (27 pfennigs) per 
kilowatt hour. For example, Aachen: here, since September 1992 
per council decision, Oekostrom must be compensated for 
costs--still against continuing resistance on the part of local 
producers of electricity. 
  Such compensation would also help the eastern part of 
Germany 
to catch up with windmills. At the end of 1992 the propellers of 
around 1,200 wind power installations were rotating in Germany, 
only a few of these in the new states. The leader here, as west 
of the Elbe, has long been the North. By April 1993 there were 
43 installations in the costal state of 
Mecklenburg-Vorpomerania, according to the Institute for Solar 
Energy Production Technology at the Polytechnic in Cassel 
(ISEPT). In Sachsen-Anhalt there were just eight, in Saxony 
seven and in Thueringen only two. 
  In Brandenburg five windmills have by now fed 1.5 MW of 
electricity into the public grid. 
  In summer the Potsdam Ministry of the Environment presented 
a 
study on the wind potential of the country, which was worked on 
by the Kraftwerks- und Anlagenbau AG [power station and 
installation construction company] in Berlin, the Kuntzsch 
engineering firm in Dresden and the Green League. The first wind 
field in the Brandenburg brown coal region is to be on the tip 
of a 300 meter tall overlay near Cottbus. Ten wind power 
installations each with a 500 kW output will send electricity 
over a five kilometer long underground cable to the Jaenschwalde 
power station, from where it will enter the VEAG grid. This 
capacity--five Danish and Dutch wind power installations--was 
placed on the Hirtstein within a period of a year by the 
Daniels/Kuntzsch duo. Rated output: 1,025 kW at a wind velocity 
of 10 to 13 m/s. 
  Unexpected stresses from the weather and surprising 
technical 
difficulties created problems. "Quickly changing wind 
directions, frost, snow accumulation and sleet made it hard to 
manage rotor wings and control technique," Daniels remembers. 
The operators defrosted the rotors with 300 W halogen lamps, and 
in the future UV lamps are also supposed to be installed. 
  With the mills made by the producer Micon which have 
actually 
been tested in practice, switching generator levels did not work 
at first and the hydraulics of the windbrakes leaked. Downtimes 
quickly grew to 15&percnt;--two million kWh less than predicted. 
  Still, Daniels is certain that wind energy production on the 
crest of the Erz Mountains is proving its worth: "A few hundred 
windmills could soon be turning on both sides of the 
German-Czechoslovakian border. This could check the poisonous 
fumes coming from the brown coal power plants in the Bohemian 
basin, which are killing the forests in the Erz Mountains." 
  In the meantime, the wind power pioneers have even won the 
support of the locals in the Erz Mountains. At first they had to 
take a good look at a citizen's initiative. The most important 
counter arguments: Windmills are too loud, they have a negative 
affect on the landscape, and they are a danger to birds. 
<H5>  Shutter Mills </H5>
  The last objection has been refuted by studies carried out 
since 1984 in Holland and Lower Saxony and by experience in 
Denmark and Sweden: High-tension lines and lighthouses kill more 
birds. As for noise, Daniels concedes that "the beating of the 
rotor wings can be heard at distances of 200 meters." Improved 
operation, higher aerodynamics of the wings, and soundproofed 
gondolas are still challenges for engineers. 
  Through personal conversations and the invitation to 
evaluate 
and discuss the wind field project, the project planners are 
finally bringing about a swing in opinion. Since it is been 
clear that the project is useful to the community and is not 
costing them money, acceptance is assured. When the mills stop 
now, Daniels reports, "the people living in Satzung call me even 
in Dresden and ask why Snub-nosed Karl, White Lady, Jolly Hans, 
Mazzebille [as written] or Old Hannes are not running."

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas J. Bencard, Ines Bronowski: "Costly </F>
Compromises"] 
  [Text] The district attorney's office in Halle and the 
criminal police in Eisleben are now bringing charges for subsidy 
fraud in connection with the cleanup of ecological contamination 
in the new laender. As far as is known, millions have been paid 
out from the Trust Agency and land treasury through Trust 
Agency-owned Mansfeld Umwelt- und Recycling GmbH and the 
nonprofit cleanup company Mansfelder Land to the Eisleben 
recycling company MFD, without the corresponding work having 
been done. 
  What was brought to light in the Mansfeld region indicates 
what is in store for the federal government and the laender from 
the regulation on financing the ecological pollution. This 
business of the cleanup billions, which the taxpayers have to 
come up with, has triggered a boom in a highly profitable 
market--and for dubious suppliers as well. After the Mansfeld 
scandal came out, Hettstedt district administrator Hans-Peter 
Sommer, for example, demanded that Trust Agency chief Birgit 
Breuel impose public oversight of contracts, performance, and 
payments. 
  Here things are not so good. In many cases Birgit Breuel's 
Berlin agency has issued insufficient regulations for the 
treatment of ecological pollution in privatizations, criticized 
the Federal Supreme Auditing Institute in its most recent annual 
report: 


    -  In the privatization contracts the concept of 
"ecological pollution was predominantly not unequivocal and not 
uniformly applied;" even the cost of cleanup, restoration, and 
maintenance costs was extra. 
  -  In one out of every two contracts signed by the end of 1992, 
the Trust Agency did not limit its cost liability. 
  -  As late as the second half of 1992, in four out of 10 
contracts 
the Trust Agency had not locked in "the participatory rights 
which, among other things, assure the authorization and followup 
of ecological pollution measures by the Trust Agency." 

    The agency is trying to play down the whole thing. "The 
Auditing Institute," dismisses Heiner Bonnenberg, among others, 
head of the Trust Agency's Directorate for Environment and 
Pollution, "criticizes everything we do." He has to admit, 
however, that "oversight is in fact our problem." The reason: 
According to Bonnenberg, many privatizations were completed 
under "time and quantitative pressure." Without compromises many 
interested buyers would probably simply have turned away for 
fear of incalculable pollution risks. 
  The Trust Agency often had to make pragmatic decisions. For 
this reason the Trust Agency, before the 22 October 1992 Federal 
Government-Laender-administrative agreement on sharing the 
cleanup costs, agreed to participate extensively in the cost--in 
some cases up to 90 percent. About 3,000 contracts, perhaps even 
1,000 more, contain such agreements. 
  No one knows what the actual cost of the cleanup will 
ultimately be. To be sure, with its "pollution assessment" 
instrument the Trust Agency has tried to achieve an overview of 
about 3,000 cases within two years. Without clearly defined 
opportunities for cooperation and control, however, that will 
scarcely be enough. 
  In the Trust Agency's "planned final balance" of 270 billion 
German marks [DM], Trust Agency head Breuel insists that, out of 
precaution, she has reserved funds amounting to DM 12 to 15 
billion for environmental cleanup. Will that be enough? "There 
are always surprises," Birgit Breuel concedes. 
  Another uncertainty factor in the billion-mark poker about 
pollution is the definition problem: How far should the cleanup 
actually go? At least in the privatization contracts, the 
Federal Supreme Auditing Institute charges, there are no such 
specifications. 
  This problem could be expensive not only for the Trust 
Agency. Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer, at any rate, fears 
that for the billion-mark amounts which various expert 
estimators mention "one could probably return the soil of the 
entire ex-GDR to its virgin state." Cleanup can thus mean only 
one thing to Toepfer: Making subsequent utilization of each 
surface possible without danger for humans and environment. 
  The minister therefore urgently requests passage of the 
Federal Soil Protection Law, which exists as a draft bill and is 
now being sent around for comment. The draft bill provides for 
nationally uniform specification of the demands for pollution 
cleanup by means of legal regulations. This would pave the way 
for the Technical Soil Directive demanded by Toepfer, which is 
to establish exact criteria for the condition of the soil for 
certain applications. 
  It has not even been clarified how, after the Trust Agency 
concludes its operational business in 1994, the pollution 
agreements are to be continued. "Whether another successor 
institution will be created," says Bonnenberg, "or whether a 
department of the Federal Ministry of Finance will take over, 
has not yet been determined."

  [Text] In the new laender and Berlin (East) 66,909 areas 
suspected of being polluted have been found so far (as of August 
1993). Then there are another 4,394 areas suspected of military 
and weapon pollution. These figures have been reported by the 
Federal Environment Agency in Berlin. 
  With the "Administrative Agreement on the Regulation of 
Ecological Pollution" (Administrative Act on Pollution 
Financing, Federal Gazette No 58, 25 March 1993, p 2842), the 
Federal Government and the new laender have agreed to share the 
costs. This agreement ties in with the exemption clause in the 
Environment Law. According to it, the responsible land 
authorities in eastern Germany may exempt investors from 
liability for already existing pollution. In all, more than 
60,000 such exemption applications have been submitted, but 
until now only a fraction of them have been decided. 
  For the exemptions which receive a favorable decision the 
administrative agreement provides that the Trust Agency and the 
land, with commensurate participation by the buyer (at least 10 
percent), share the costs at a ratio of 60:40. This regulation 
applies to existing Trust Agency businesses or those privatized 
after 1 January 1992. 
  For the so-called large projects, the cost sharing is 75:25. 
For the Large Brown Coal Cleanup Project the financial basis was 
set at DM 1.5 billion annually until 1998. For the Large 
Chemical Project, with the individual projects Buna AG, 
Leuna-Werke, Filmfabrik Wolfen, Chemie AG Bitterfeld and 
Hydrierwerk Zeitz, about DM 2.3 billion must be anticipated, 
according to present estimates. 
  For another 14 large projects agreed on by the Trust Agency 
and the laender, a funding requirement of about DM 100 million, 
respectively, is assumed. These projects are: 


    -  Berlin: The region of the Spree Industrial Area 
(Adlershof, Rummelsburg, Ober- and Niederschoeneweide, 
Johannisthal sectors) 
  -  Brandenburg: The Kreis Oranienburg region (Hennigsdorf, 
Velten, 
Birkenwerder, Oranienburg, Hennigsdorf Business Park sectors) 
  -  Mecklenburg-West Pomerania: Neptun-Warnow-Werft Rostock, MTW 
Schiffswerft Wismar 
  -  Saxony: Saxonia AG Freiberg, Olefinwerke AG 
Boehlen-Lippendorf, 
Lautawerk GmbH 
  -  Saxony-Anhalt: Erdoel/Erdgas-Gommern GmbH 
(Salzwedel/Peckensen 
development region), Mansfeld AG (Rohuette Helbra, copper-silver 
mine), Magdeburg Rothensee region) 
  -  Thuringia: Kali-Werra AG (Merkers), Kali-Suedharz AG 
(Sondershausen, Bleicherode, Sollstedt, Bischofferode), Rositz 
Administration and Third-Party Rights Exploitation 
Association. 

    In addition to these billion-mark sums, the federal 
government is providing another DM 13 billion for accident 
prevention measures in the region of the Wismut enterprises.

<F P=106> [Article by Juergen Grubitsch: "The Dirt in the Silbersee"] </F>
  [Text] Put a lid on and leave it, some recommended, but 
others dreamed of a recreation area with a beach for swimming 
and gondola trips. The object of this fantasy: The 14-hectare 
sludge hole between Bitterfeld and Wolfen, where an evil mixture 
of sulfite lye, lignin, cellulose, sulfates, bleaching waters, 
hydrogen sulfides and carbon disulfides, salts, alcohols, 
phenols and solvents is swimming. For years, toxic waste from 
the Wolfen film factory created the pool of muck, which--because 
of its shimmering surface--after the unification became world 
famous as Silver Lake. 
  Now, a company in the region wants to perform a miracle and 
free the residents of nearby Wolfen-Wachtendorf from the stench 
of this sewer. The Sangerhaeuser Maschinenfabrik (SAMAG), which, 
together with its subsidiaries, takes part in the cleanup of the 
former film factory, promises to return the water to ecological 
balance with its Aqua-life unit. 
  To begin with, a large-scale test has been under way since 
June. Independent environmental laboratories are taking samples 
every day and checking on the progress. The decision is to be 
made at the beginning of October. Then, if this succeeds beyond 
all doubt, a large assault can be made with additional equipment 
even this year. This is aimed first at the surface of the 
Silbersee. "The thin layer of water over two million cubic 
meters of sludge must first resume its function as a 
hydrological stopper," SAMAG's laboratory chief Axel Koenig 
explains the principle. This plug will first be enriched with 
atmospheric oxygen. Then the developing harmful gases will 
already be oxidized and mineralized below the surface, Koenig 
anticipates. At the same time bacterial cultures are to initiate 
biological breakdown processes. The cleanup people's vision: 
Complete food chains from microorganisms to fish are to be 
recreated in the oxygen-rich water. Later on, the "disarmed" 
sludge could be dredged up almost without odor and burned. 
  The cleanup is not without risk. To be sure, in the 
jelly-like mass of the pit there are only small quantities of 
heavy metals, says Koenig, and the ground water is protected by 
a barrier of lignin. The real difficulty threatens on top: "A 
major danger is that with large additions of air into the not 
quite 30-centimeter-thin layer of the surface water, the entire 
brew will begin to churn," the laboratory chief fears. 
  Within the space of three months microbiologists, flow 
technicians, designers, engineers and workers designed and built 
a "special ship" which is to overcome the problems: At the end, 
they gave the discharge from the mobile water purification unit 
the form of a snout. It avoids swirling up the shallow water. 
  The technical principle is a Venturi system that sucks up 
polluted water. In the aerator part it is squeezed through a 
"throat" and mixed with air, which intensifies the oxygen 
absorption of the water. Subsequently, the water passes through 
a 15-meter-long flow channel with columns of biological growth 
surfaces. When the light, oxygen-rich mixture flows through, on 
the one hand it promotes the growth of microorganisms. On the 
other, it tears off the overhanging part of the growth and 
carries it off with the water. That is how new life is supposed 
to originate. 
  Naturally, SAMAG administrator Eckart Harrmann is more 
fascinated by the economic than the technical aspects. "If we 
get the final contract for cleaning up the Silbersee, with 
another six to 12 units it will become a million-mark deal," he 
calculates. The image of "having cleaned up to some extent" the 
notorious sewer would be a priceless reference "in the eyes of 
the world." 
  Even now, Harrmann convincingly praises the Aqua-life 
purification system from Sangerhausen. It can be used in creeks, 
rivers, and standing waters as well as in conventional treatment 
plants. All it needs is a power supply. Harrmann adds: "The cost 
of hiring our services until the end of a cleanup mission is 
low." The company thus accommodates the strained financial 
situation in many companies and municipalities.

<F P=106> [Article by Theo Westerwoudt: "First `Clean' Electricity </F>
from Coal Gas: Production at New Power Plant in Limburg Will Be 
More Ecologically Sound"] 
  [Text] Buggenum, 8 Oct--In the Limburg town of Buggenum on 
the Maas, in the municipality of Haelen, near Roermond, a 
remarkable example of technological innovation is being 
realized, intended to help the Netherlands continue using pit 
coal as one of the most important fuels for generating 
electricity. But this in a way that is noticeably friendlier to 
the environment than that to which we are currently accustomed, 
with less discharge of noxious emissions and dust, better 
quality, and more recycling of residues. 
  Right next to the Maas Power Plant, a large conventional 
coal-burning plant for generating electricity that is scheduled 
to be shut down in 2000, the Cooperating Electricity Production 
Enterprises (SEP) have built a demonstration plant that is to 
gasify coal based on a process developed by Shell. This new 
power plant, with a capacity of 253 megawatts of electricity 
(MWe), is currently the largest of its kind in the world. The 
system must prove itself during a three-year demonstration 
phase. If successful, a big brother of "Buggenum" will be built 
in Borsele, Zeeland, with a capacity of 600 megawatts. 
  The part of the Limburg installation that generates 
electricity is already operating on natural gas as an element of 
the startup program, and is providing 100 megawatts of 
electricity to the public network. In a few weeks the colossal 
coal gasifier will also be started up, says Eng. G.D. Zon, the 
project director of Demkolec, a subsidiary of the SEP set up 
specifically for the new project. After that, the capacity will 
be gradually increased to the maximum. Ultimately the power 
plant will process 2,000 metric tons of coal a day. 
  According to Zon, the electricity that his installation will 
then deliver is still about 20 percent more expensive than that 
coming from a 600-megawatt powdered coal plant, but "Buggenum" 
is intended to be a model for the large-scale application of 
coal gasification. "At a capacity of 600 megawatts with high 
efficiency, the production price is competitive. But we are 
primarily interested in the environmental advantages. If all 
this succeeds, and you put price tags on all the aspects, then I 
think that a coal gasifier will end up being cheaper." 
  Coal gasification is not a new technology, as many 
Limburgers 
in particular know, because right in front of city hall in 
Maastricht stands a statue of Father Prof. Pieter Johan 
Minckelers, who discovered 210 years ago that heating pit coal 
in an old barrel releases gas that is well-suited to launching 
hot-air balloons and to lighting and heating. Since the 
beginning of this century, the system has been applied by 
municipalities on a large scale for the production for city gas, 
but in the 1960's it was supplanted by cheaper and much cleaner 
natural gas. For decades, industry has used the cheap gas 
obtained from the production of coke, and during World War II 
the Germans made synthetic gasoline from coal gas. Beginning in 
1935, tests were also conducted with the underground 
gasification of pit coal, but this has yet to yield commercial 
success. 
  Coal gas as a fuel for generating electricity is indeed new. 
In the late 1980's, Shell emerged as the winner of a bitter 
struggle with competitors Texaco and British Gas Lurgi and was 
able to provide the SEP with its technology, which came from the 
technique that the company uses for oil gasification. All the 
oil companies threw themselves into gasification technology 
during the 1970's, says Eng. Zon. "After the first oil crisis, 
they expected a shortage and a sharp price increase for oil and 
natural gas. Because of that, the raw materials for the 
petrochemical industry would also become much more expensive, 
and so an alternative was sought. Synthesis gas, which is 
created from coal gasification, is also suitable as feedstock 
for the chemicals industry. That is why you now see all the oil 
companies following this route. They have invested a great deal 
of money in it. Coal gasification also generates hydrogen, and 
the petrochemical industry always needs that. And it is easy to 
combine the carbon in the gas with the hydrogen to create 
substances that you need in the chemicals industry." 
  Modern natural gas-fired electric power plants can easily 
achieve efficiency of more than 50 percent or even a little 
higher. The test installation in Buggenum achieves 43 percent, 
because of the applied technique. "Just look at our STEG unit 
(steam and gas are both fed into turbines and the power is 
converted into electricity via a generator) and then we will 
achieve more than 50 percent," says Zon. "Then you have to 
consider that we produce our own gas, while a natural gas plant 
has its fuel delivered ready to use. But for this sort of power 
plant there is an entire battery of equipment that treats the 
gas and keeps it under pressure." 
  According to the director of Demkolec, a 600-megawatt coal 
gasification plant should be able to achieve efficiency of 47 
percent, and theoretically even 50 percent. But Zon is no 
fetishist; he points out that the most modern powdered coal 
plants will match the performance of coal gasification in terms 
of efficiency and environmental properties. "I think that you 
should install both systems side by side, in a competitive 
relationship, with regard to power plant availability, cost per 
kilowatt hour, and environmental performance." This opinion 
diverges from the Master Plan for Electricity Supply, in which 
the government, if "Buggenum" is successful, expresses a 
preference for pit coal gasification alone in generating 
electricity, aside from the two other fuels: natural gas and 
uranium. 
  The government and electricity producers are in complete 
agreement that coal is absolutely essential to the large-scale 
generation of electricity. In the 1970's, the ideal mix of fuels 
was determined to be one-third natural gas, one-third coal, and 
one-third nuclear energy, but that mix was never achieved due to 
the problems with opposition to nuclear power plants. Zon, who 
was the director of the Nucon engineering firm for a number of 
years, which specializes in nuclear energy: "If we were to 
decide tomorrow to build new nuclear power plants, then in my 
opinion you would have to regard coal gasification differently, 
because nuclear energy remains cleaner and cheaper. Three fuels 
with one-third each: That should remain the goal, that is 
preferable in terms of the environment and price and also in 
terms of fuel availability." 
  The assortment of fuels used right now is quite different. 
Last year, 57 percent of the electricity produced in the 
Netherlands was generated with natural gas, 37 percent with 
coal, and 6 percent with uranium. In order to maintain the share 
of coal--a relatively cheap and widely available fuel--at that 
level, coal gasification is essential as one of the techniques 
for cleaner burning. The coal is combined with pure oxygen in a 
gasifier at a temperature of 1,500 degrees Celsius and a 
pressure of 30 atmospheres. The coal gas product is then cooled, 
purified, and subjected to "deep desulfurization," Zon explains, 
through which the discharge of sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; ) 
is sharply reduced. The pure sulfur residue can be easily sold 
on the domestic market, because the Netherlands currently still 
imports sulfur. 
  By diluting the coal gas, the content of nitrogen oxides 
(NOx) is sharply reduced. Purification (with water) of the gas 
ensures a very limited discharge of matter from the power plant. 
The water is purified again and evaporated, which leaves salts 
as residue. Coal gasification has another environmental 
advantage: The greenhouse gas CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  can be captured 
easily and cheaply before combustion, although that has a 
negative effect on efficiency. This is not yet being done in 
Buggenum, but it can be considered for new, larger power plants. 
  Over the next two years, Demkolec will test seven types of 
coal of various composition in the power plant and based on that 
draw up a "blueprint" for new gasification plants. In the third 
year, "Buggenum" will work with the SEP's National Efficiency 
Program, the goal being to show that the availability of the 
power plant is greater than 70 percent. There are currently 120 
people working at the plant on day-to-day operations, plus 
another 35 experts, including a number of people from Shell and 
KEMA [Arnem Institute for the Testing of Electrical Engineering 
Equipment], for testing, the demonstration program, and 
evaluation. 
  "Shell has worked for 15 years on the total course of this 
technology," says Zon. "But the potential for large-scale 
application of this clean technology has increased sharply over 
the past five years in particular, so that we can now say 
confidently that it is becoming affordable and competitive for 
the Netherlands, which together with Germany has the strictest 
environmental regulations in the world."

<F P=106> [Article by Staffan Dahllof: "Swedish Aeronautics Sets </F>
Danish Wind Power Spinning"--first paragraph is NY TEKNIK 
introduction] 
  [Text] Windpower plants can capture 20-30 percent more 
energy with a new type of rotor blade profile. The new long 
blade was developed in a cooperative effort between a Danish 
manufacturer and Swedish aerodynamics experts. 
  Airplane wings have long served as a model for windpower 
plants' rotor blades. 
  But a windpower plant's rotor blades are exposed to a large 
variation in the wind's angle of attack. 
  "The rotor blades should preferably have a broader spectrum 
of optimum efficiency than airplane wings," said development 
chief Peter Grabau of LM Glasfiber, the biggest supplier of wind 
turbine blades in the world. 
  These ideas were also found at Sweden's FFA, the 
Aeronautical 
Research Institute, in Ulvsunda outside Stockholm. 
<H5>  Sharper Leading Edge </H5>
  When the FFA was asked to design a new rotor blade profile 
the result was a sharper leading edge than before. The blade has 
lower lift capacity but better performance before it stalls. 
  Stall means that above a certain speed the wind "loses its 
grip" on the rotor blade. With increasing wind the wind's angle 
of attack increases so that finally the air escapes from the 
suction side of the profile. In an airplane this means that lift 
ceases. In a windpower plant it means that the rotor blade 
checks the wind instead of being driven around by it. 
<H5>  Reduced Maximum Output </H5>
  The wing for LM Glasfiber was given a triangular profile 
which makes it stall at a lower wind speed than before. The 
power plant's maximum output may be reduced which, somewhat 
paradoxically, is an advantage. Generators and gear boxes do not 
have to be dimensioned for great wind speeds. 
  "One can simply capture more energy from the wind in the 
wind 
area that lies below the generator's maximum output," said 
Anders Bjorck of FFA. 
  This is done by increasing the length of the blade. 
  To fine-tune stall properties parts of the blade have been 
given a triangular profile, a so-called stall-strip. 
<H5>  Longer Wings </H5>
  With a well-defined stall LM Glasfiber can build longer 
wings 
for existing power plants or hold down dimensions on generators 
for new plants and still get greater yield. 
  "Larger wings mean that energy production is increased by 
20-30 percent," said Peter Grabau of LM Glasfiber. 
  The FFA's work for the Danish rotor blade manufacturer could 
benefit Swedish wind power indirectly. The FFA also cooperates 
with Nordic Windpower (AF Industriteknik and Hagglunds) which 
built a 400 kW experimental power plant at Lysekil. 
<H5>  Useful for Others </H5>
  "The coordinates for LM Glasfiber's wings belong to them, of 
course, but our increasing knowledge of wing design is something 
that other clients can also benefit from," said Anders Bjorck of 
FFA.

<F P=106> [Article by Lars Eriksson: "Radioactive Scrap Reclaimed With </F>
New Swedish Method"--first two paragraphs are NY TEKNIK 
introduction] 
  [Text] In the fall Framatome, the French nuclear technology 
firm, will test a new Swedish method to clean and recycle 
radioactive steam generators from nuclear power plants. 
  The method has already been tested on steam generators from 
the closed nuclear reactor in Agesta outside Stockholm. 
  The method for cleaning and recycling steam generators was 
developed by Sweden's Studsvik RadWaste. The Swedish State Power 
Board, a number of Japanese companies via Mitsubishi, the French 
power company EDF and the French nuclear technology firm 
Framatome have supported the development. 
  Framatome has acquired a license to use the method in the 
French market. The method will now be tested on a replaced steam 
generator from the nuclear power plant in Dampierre. If all goes 
well, there are more steam generators to take care of. France 
has the highest concentration of nuclear power in Europe. 
  "This method has two advantages. For one thing we recover 
valuable metals that can be reused and for another we reduce the 
volume of radioactive waste," said Olof Andersson, president of 
Studsvik RadWaste. 
  Steam generators consist of a very extensive pipe system. 
The 
total tube length in an average steam generator is approximately 
nine miles. It is in the tubes that most of the radioactivity is 
located. 
  The tubes are rinsed with a liquid called SODP (Strong Ozone 
Decontamination Process). It consists of ozone dissolved in 
nitric acid with cerium nitrate as a catalyst. With the help of 
the solution about five micrometers of oxide deposit are 
removed. It is there the radioactivity is located. The process 
takes 72 hours. 
  "This type of liquid is sometimes used for cleaning inside 
reactors. But few people believed in our idea that it could be 
used to reclaim steam generators," Andersson said. 
<H5>  Metals Separated </H5>
  After it is cleaned the steam generator is melted down and 
the various metals are separated. 
  The method has been successfully tested on two steam 
generators from the closed nuclear power plant in Agesta. The 
radioactivity in the generators fell from 10,000 bequerels per 
gram to at best 1 bequerel per gram as a result of the process. 
  It is somewhat unclear which maximum value applies for a 
free 
classification of radioactive material. At present it is 1 
bequerel per gram in Sweden, according to the SSI [National 
Institute of Radiation Protection] standard, but international 
discussions are under way on this. 
  The solvent contains most of the radioactivity after 
processing. The volume is reduced by evaporating the solution 
("boiling it down") and encasing it in cement. This waste 
residue is then shipped for final storage in the storage 
facility for low- and medium-active waste, SFR in Forsmark. 
<H5>  Much Larger </H5>
  Three steam generators were replaced in reactor 2 at the 
Ringhals plant several years ago. Studsvik RadWaste and the 
Ringhals management are currently discussing whether to use the 
new method on them. 
  The Ringhals steam generators are considerably larger than 
the Agesta generators; 300 tons apiece compared with 25 tons. 
The volume is 17 times greater. 
  The radioactivity is 10 times higher. The reason is that the 
Agesta generators have cooled down for about 20 years. The 
reactor was in operation from 1964 to 1974. 
  After a Ringhals steam generator is processed there will be 
50 tons of nickel and chromium and 200 tons of iron left that 
can be recycled. The iron can be used for manufacturing concrete 
reinforcement rods and radiators, among other things. The nickel 
and chromium that is recovered can be used for manufacturing new 
steam generators. 
  That leaves 22 cubic meters of encased radioactive solution, 
four cubic meters of slag from the smelting process and 15 cubic 
meters of massive steel (a tube plate that is considered hard to 
clean). 
  Melting down radioactive material is nothing new in itself. 
In the last 10 years around 1,300 tons of radioactive steel from 
various reactor components and tools have been melted down at 
Studsvik. Some 200 tons of material has been classified as 
radiation-free. The remaining 1,100 tons are being stored at 
Studsvik for final disposal later. 
<H5>  Around 150 Replacements </H5>
  In the next 10 years around 150 steam generators will need 
to 
be replaced worldwide. So Studsvik RadWaste, which holds the 
world patent, hopes that this method will give them a lot of 
good business in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Rainer Antkowiak: "Plastic Waste Frozen in </F>
Hydrocarbon Bath; Recycled Material That Comes From Deep Freeze; 
Individual Polymers Can Be Separated From One Another at 
160&deg;C, Corresponding to Their Brittleness" 
  [Text] 
Dortmund, VDI-N, 1 Oct--Clean separation of plastics from other 
materials and also the separation of individual polymers from 
one another is an essential prerequisite for the material 
recycling of plastic waste. A simple and, moreover, inexpensive 
method has now been developed at the Dortmund Institute of 
Hygiene. 
  "I might well imagine that Germany's dual system will soon 
not just cost money, but even yield profits." With this rather 
unusual prognosis, Prof. Harry Rosin, the head of the Dortmund 
Institute of Hygiene, summed up the advantages of a new process 
for recycling plastics, electronic scrap, and composite 
packaging materials. The trick to turning "Gelbe Tonnen" 
[recyclable] waste into recyclable secondary raw materials that 
are nearly completely sorted into categories is supposed to be: 
deep freezing to -160&deg;C. 
  The "Dortmund mixture," consisting of gaseous hydrocarbons 
and which Rosin has already successfully recommended as a 
refrigerant free of chlorine and fluorine for refrigerators, is 
also to be put to use in the form of a similar compound for the 
treatment of waste. Propane, ethane, and methane take care of 
the removal of heat--even from a container filled with plastic 
waste. 
  The characteristics of the materials are known: Propane 
liquefies at -42&deg;C, ethane at -88&deg;C, and methane at 
-161.4&deg;C. Each of these materials--this is the principle the 
process is based on-- vaporizes in separate cycles, extracts 
heat from the surrounding area, and is reliquefied. In the 
process, the liquefier of the lower degree of cold is cooled by 
the vaporizer of the higher degree of cold until a temperature 
of -160&deg;C is reached. 
  Rosin is convinced that at this temperature any plastic, 
even 
unmanagealbe teflon, becomes brittle, like thin glass. The 
temperature at which the most commonly used plastics become 
glasslike is about -110&deg;C. The various materials become 
brittle at different temperatures, which causes composite 
materials to fall apart or break up during the cooling process. 
Metals in electronic scrap would almost break away from the 
plastic by themselves because of the different expansion 
coefficients alone. 
  In any case, it is anticipated that a simpler way of 
crushing 
the material that consumes less energy will be produced by 
making it brittle. By means of which separation techniques the 
frozen plastic mixture can be processed is yet to be studied. 
According to Rosin, sieves, winnowers, and also flotation 
techniques are currently being tested for their suitability. 
  Rosin places particular importance on the great cost 
effectiveness of his process. Hans-Friedrich Hinrichs, the head 
of the Office for Communal Consultation on Technology in 
Oberhausen, estimated operating costs at 18 pfennig per 
kilogram--with reference to a plant that processes five tons of 
plastic waste an hour and 40,000 tons [as published] a year. And 
this is not taking into account the proceeds from sales of 
separated raw materials. Rosin: "This in comparison with the 
50-85 pfennig required at the present time by the dual system." 
  Waste incineration would also benefit from this process. 
Namely, if the plastic waste is burned as powder, a higher 
calorific value is obtained than is with the incineration of 
large pieces. 
  The deep freeze process has its limits if a plastic is, for 
example, mixed with fire retardants--like computer housing 
units. According to Rosin, they are at present engaging in 
intensive discussions with superregional waste disposal agencies.

<F P=106> [Article signed L.M.: "Cheaper and Faster Production Through </F>
Communications"] 
  [Text] Concurrent engineering supported by a technical data 
management [TDM] system reduces expenditure and shortens 
"time-to-market." Two leading electronics firms, Bull and 
Sextant Avionique, bear witness to its advantages. 
  Today, most industrial strategy advisers recommend that 
firms 
implement concurrent engineering. This is probably why there 
were so many TDM systems at the Productique 93 show, which was 
held from 22 to 26 November at Paris-Nord Villepinte. This 
software, supplied by Bull, IBM, Digital, and Win Technology, 
allows the various sections of a company (design, methods, 
production, sales) to communicate in real time and thus to be 
able to work in parallel, which is the basis of concurrent 
engineering. "TDM enables all those involved in the production 
process to ratify each new stage of a project. The result is 
that requests for technical modifications, particularly those 
from the production department (which cost from 100 to 100,000 
times more than in the development phase) are far less numerous. 
The product therefore costs less and also comes onto the market 
faster," explained Francois Ulff of Sherpa, a company 
specializing in TDM, at a conference on the subject at 
Productique 93. Bull, which both supplies a TDM product (called 
Bull PDM) and uses such a product, estimates that the cost 
saving can be up to 50 percent and that time-to-market can be 
reduced by 75 percent. According to Sextant Avionique, which 
has also acquired a TDM system, improved traceability is another 
advantage of these systems: "To reduce our costs, we try, in 
moving from one application to another, to reuse modules, and 
TDM makes this easier as it allows us to store the entire 
history of each module," explained the company's representative. 
Although those present acknowledged that considerable 
investment is required and that implementation takes time 
because TDM involves all divisions of the company, they all 
asserted that there is a rapid return on the investment. "After 
around one year," they claim.

<F P=106> [Article signed MU: "Consortium for Rapid Application </F>
Development"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- A consortium has been formed to 
standardize methods for rapid application development, starting 
in the United Kingdom, but with the aim of expanding to 
worldwide operation. The consortium, Dynamic Systems 
Development Methods (DSDM), wants to make the most of the 
advantages offered by this method of systems development. The 
members of the consortium include Software AG, Sapiens, Oracle, 
Logica, and Cognos. The British firm Butler Group is 
coordinating its efforts. The advantages of rapid application 
development, according to Butler, are shorter construction time, 
lower costs, and improved quality. DSDM is based on interactive 
prototyping with input from the end user. Prototyping means 
building a demonstration model to test whether the application 
meets the required standards. The actual application is then 
only constructed at a later stage. 
<H5>  Users Too </H5>
  In addition to the members listed above, companies such as 
Information Builders, McDonnell Douglas, Data Sciences, and 
Knowledgeware also form part of the consortium. Furthermore, 
Butler Group expects the number of interested suppliers to 
expand rapidly. "Software manufacturers, consultancies, and 
major user organizations are showing an interest. It looks as 
if DSDM will radically change the method of application 
development," says Peter Constable of Butler. 
  According to the firm, companies are expressing growing 
dissatisfaction with traditional development methods. 
"Companies deserve better. Using old methods with the latest 
technologies is like putting a diesel engine in a Formula-1 
racing car." 
  The first meeting of the new consortium is planned for 
January next year. Butler expects approximately 30 suppliers to 
attend.

<F P=106> [Article by Giorgio Rivieccio: "And Now Robots in White </F>
Overalls"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Robot Surgeon Is in Italy Too </H5>
  The United States does not have exclusive rights in the 
field 
of robot surgeons. Italy, a country with a great tradition both 
in medicine and automation, will also have its automaton in 
white overalls within a year. The experimental use of a robot 
during surgical operations will start in 1994 at the Rizzoli 
Orthopedic Institute in Bologna. The experiments will be 
conducted by Maurilio Marcacci who, together with Prof. 
Piergiorgio Marchetti, director of the laboratory of 
biomechanics, and in collaboration with the CNR (National 
Research Council) and the University of Genoa, has been working 
on the orthopedic robot project for some years. The Italian 
experts have asked the advice of ISS of Sacramento on how to 
perfect the system. 
  Marcacci explained: "The robot will essentially consist of a 
mechanical arm that has a number of joints, able to move itself 
in space, at the end of which there is an instrument (a cutter, 
a drill or something else) that can be given prior instructions 
for its movements, based on precise data resulting from 
examinations such as a CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan 
or NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance). It will be possible to 
execute extremely precise repetitive movements using the arm, 
and these will be better than a surgeon could do." 
  Researchers at Rizzoli think that the possible applications 
of an orthopedic robot include surgery of the knee and spine. 
<H5>  `Virtual Surgery' at Pisa and at Boston </H5>
  The orthopedic field is already restrictive for the robot in 
white overalls. New and promising horizons have already opened 
up with the marriage between robotics and virtual reality. 
Digitalizing the images of a patient's organ, something that has 
been made possible by the diffusion of diagnostic instruments 
such as the CAT, RMN, and PET [positron emission tomography], 
seems to have been done to link together and form something that 
can interpret the data and then intervene on the patient with 
millimetric precision, that is, a robot. 
  At Pisa university, researchers from the Santa Chiara 
Hospital radiology institute, together with researchers from 
Hewlett-Packard, one of whom is the American Irwin Sobel one of 
the fathers of computerized graphics, have created the first 
Italian virtual reality system applied to neurological 
diagnosis, medicine, and to the preparation of surgical 
operations. The radiologist Davide Caramella, one of the 
researchers working on the project, explained that: "The system 
acquires data from diagnostic instruments like the TAC and 
magnetic resonance. These supply two-dimensional images that 
correspond to many very fine `strata', or `slices' of an organ, 
such as the brain. The computer uses special software to 
reconstruct a three-dimensional virtual image from this 
information. The different tissues of the brain are then 
highlighted using false colors. Finally a pair of stereoscopic 
glasses that look like an underwater mask recreate the effect of 
depth for the person wearing them, thanks to which the image 
literally seems to come out of the screen and invade the room." 
  Former systems for the visualization of medical images, such 
as those based on videodisks or multimedia computers, suddenly 
become out of date because the data they contain cannot be 
changed and refers to a typical patient, comparable to that 
shown in the anatomical plates of a text book. On the other 
hand, using the system developed at Pisa, the neurologist, or 
the surgeon, finds himself in front of a faithful representation 
of the brain structure of that particular patient. In this way 
they can carry out a virtual surgical operation, identical in 
every part to that which they must then face in reality. For 
example they can study the best course for an instrument to 
reach the mass of a tumor without damaging the healthy 
structures that surround it and they can find out whether they 
will meet other risky situations during the operation such as an 
aneurysm that could burst. [passage omitted] 
  Finally, the potential of virtual reality in neurosurgery is 
the central point of research being carried out by Cesare Giorgi 
of the Carlo Besta Neurological Institute in Milan, as part of 
the CNR targeted robotics project. 
<H5>  How Much Electronics for Remote Surgery </H5>
  But virtual reality is not only images. It also makes it 
possible to intervene on the electronic environment created by 
the computer and modify it using an "electronic glove," called a 
"dataglove," that directly translates the movements of the hand, 
wrist, and individual fingers, into instructions for the 
computer. 
  The "dataglove," developed by Jaron Lanier of the American 
company VPL Research, is made of photo transistors and sensors 
that capture every movement made by the hand, while tiny 
gyroscopes keep record of the movements of the complete hand in 
space. The "dataglove" was also baptized in the medical surgery 
field, when on 2 December last year the first remote surgical 
operation was performed between the Milan Polytechnic and the 
Umberto 1 General Hospital in Rome. 
  Wearing a "dataglove," Prof. Alberto Rovetta of Milan 
commanded a robot installed in Rome which performed an operation 
on a model via cable. The movements of Rovetta's hand, which 
moved in the air, were transferred with the greatest accuracy to 
the arm of the robot. With respect to former remote control 
techniques for robot systems, "dataglove" avoids having to learn 
the commands and techniques of manipulation. The user only has 
to perform the natural movements that he would perform on a real 
patient. 
  This Italian "first" opens up a horizon that has no 
limitations and makes it possible to operate on patients that 
are hundreds or thousands of kilometers away, perhaps in areas 
where it is not possible to have the specialized assistance 
necessary for a serious case. 
  This was quickly confirmed on 7 July by another exceptional 
experiment conducted by Italy and the United States. For the 
first time in the world a surgeon, Licineo Angelini of La 
Sapienza University in Rome, operated via satellite from 
California on an animal organ in the Milan Polytechnic. The 
operation was made possible by a robot manipulator, commanded by 
Angelini and connected to an identical piece of equipment that 
operated on the sick organ. 
  The "patient" was a simulator model of the human body in 
which the liver of a pig and a synthetic gall-bladder had been 
inserted. The Italian part of the experiment was once again 
coordinated by Alberto Rovetta of the Milan Polytechnic, who 
drew from the experience of the American jet propulsion 
laboratory of Pasadena, the NASA research institute where the 
"space robots" that explored the planets of the solar system 
were born. 
  Angelini had a robot in front of him and an ecographic 
monitor that sent back the images of the "patient" in Milan. 
The surgeon commanded the robot, that then transmitted the 
instructions to its correspondent in Milan, ordering it to make 
a stitch after having localized the exact point on the model by 
means of the ecographic scanner images. Then the robot was 
ordered to make two incisions. 
  The experiment was part of the CIAO [Collaboration, 
Intervention and Help in Hospitals] program that plans for 
remote surgical operations to be performed by robots. 
<H5>  The Robot That Reconstructs the Organism in Milan </H5>
  However, in the hospital of the year 2000, the robot will 
not 
only take over in the operating theater. Other types of 
automatons will work in laboratories to reconstruct, with the 
maximum accuracy, bones and other "inserts" of human tissue that 
have been destroyed as a result of accidents or destructive 
surgery. 
  The prototype computer-robotic reconstruction system, which 
is unique in Europe at present, has once again been perfected in 
Milan by the group of Luigi Donati, director of the Statale 
University plastic surgery institute, and has been built at 
Niguarda hospital. 
  It is called MIRUS-Lab (Management of Imaging and Robot 
Utilization in Surgery) and once again it results from the 
possibility of digitizing any element of the organism using 
diagnostic image techniques. The computer, integrating the data 
coming from these instruments, reconstructs an "electronic twin" 
of the patient on the screen. Then using techniques similar to 
those of the CAD-CAM [computer-aided design - computer-aided 
manufacturing] used in industry for computer design, the system 
examines the area to be reconstructed and designs the anatomical 
parts that are missing. Finally it transfers the design to a 
robot that builds the "bioinserts" to be put into the patient, 
using numerically controlled fabrication techniques similar to 
those used by advanced mechanical industries. 
  Finally, the MIRUS-Lab is also able to help the surgeon to 
choose, and optimize, different materials with respect to the 
biological and mechanical characteristics of the parts to be 
replaced. 
  Thanks to this system it is therefore possible to carry out 
reconstructive surgery, by having the exact prosthesis to be 
inserted in the patient, in bone or other tissue, available 
before the operation, and eventually to carry out a first 
simulation of the operation on a computer, to see if the insert 
has been made correctly and if it adapts exactly to the organism 
of the patient. In fact, the reconstruction of anatomical parts 
has hitherto been performed directly in the operating theater 
and for obvious reasons the surgeon had to prepare these parts 
extremely quickly. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Chabbert and Michel Vilnat: "Machine Tool </F>
Industry Still Innovating"; introductory paragraph in boldface 
as published] 
  [Text] The World Machine Tool Fair [EMO] has lived up to 
its reputation as a technological showcase. But the industry is 
in crisis. Mergers and takeovers of firms are increasing. 
  Linear spindle driving motors, very high-speed steel 
machining, and the integration of PC's [personal computers] into 
numerical control were all part of the 10th EMO, which was held 
in Hannover in mid-September and which lived up to its 
reputation as an international technological showcase. But 
economic conditions are not conducive to optimism, especially 
among European manufacturers. 
  A sign of the times: CECIMO [European Cooperation Committee 
for Machine Tool Industries], the organization representing all 
European machine tool manufacturers associations, has just 
presented the European Commission with a document--the first 
ever--in which it makes proposals for maintaining the 
competitiveness of its firms in the world market. The crisis is 
affecting German manufacturers in particular: They are facing a 
wave of mergers and takeovers that has been growing steadily 
stronger in recent months. 
  Following the announcement of Maho's merger with Deckel, 
there is already talk of their joining the Gildemeister group, a 
company that has been sharing its worldwide marketing network 
with Deckel since the beginning of the year. Another German 
merger, that between Traub and Hermle, is being limited solely 
to the marketing network for the time being. In the field of 
large machines, the Doerries-Scharmann group is becoming the 
world leader by acquiring several moribund companies around the 
world in a short period of time (Wohlenberg, Skoda Machine 
Tools, Schiess, and the RD&amp;D). Kennametal, the number one 
American maker of cutting tools, acquired 81 percent of the 
Hertel Company's capital as recently as last August. 
  But that very lively situation is not preventing some 
manufacturers--and not necessarily the biggest--from continuing 
to innovate. Among the most outstanding innovations presented at 
the EMO, those involving numerical control will certainly have 
an important impact in all machine tool sectors. Most of the 
major manufacturers have sought to integrate PC's into their 
numerical control systems. One example is the French 
manufacturer Num, whose PCNC, the fruit of a union between a PC 
and a CNC [computerized numerical control] system, will have 
applications in turning, milling, and so on. The marriage of 
those two technologies opens up numerical control to the OS2/2.1 
multitasking system. It improves versatility considerably. 
Numerical control directs the work process as well as the path 
of the automatic mechanisms. In the meantime, the Intel 486 
microprocessor supervises the man-machine interface. For 
example, it manages the programs and tools, helps with 
maintenance, and makes it possible to use advanced CAD/CAM 
[computer-aided design and manufacturing] programming languages. 
"A detail of interest to future customers is the fact that this 
introduction of the PC into numerical control will have a very 
slight effect on prices," says Jean-Luc Gely, Num's marketing 
and product director. This new development is not restricted to 
Num. GE Fanuc is offering a similar improvement in its CNC-16, 
which has been renamed 16M in honor of the occasion. Like the 
French product, the 16M uses an Intel processor. 
<H5>  Operation Display </H5>
  For its part, Grundig Electronics is also unveiling a new 
generation CNC using three 32-bit processors with Risc 
architecture. Christened the CNC EPL Turn Plus and intended for 
turning operations, it also uses PC-type Windows programming. As 
an example, it can take charge of the entire machining process 
on a two-spindle lathe without the operator's having to concern 
himself with transferring the workpiece from one spindle to 
another. It is also used on the Electro Pilot Turn Plus, a lathe 
that makes it easier to program the numerical control system. 
The workpiece is first machined in the conventional manner using 
electronic levers, and the CN uses that to automatically set up 
the corresponding program. 
  For its part, Siemens is exploring an original path: 
multimedia using its CNC Sinumerik 840C. With this system, the 
operator can observe the operation continually on all or part of 
the screen. Doerries-Scharmann is offering the same arrangement 
on one of its Contumat vertical lathes. 
  Long considered unattainable, the high-speed machining of 
hard materials is beginning to become an industrial reality. 
"Mass-produced" machines of that kind are now being offered to 
users. With its Heynumill 2500-GS portal milling machine, 
Germany's Heyligenstaedt is representative of that trend. For 
semifinishing operations, its machine uses a 20-kW, 10,000-rpm 
spindle with a feed speed as high as 15 meters per minute. For 
finishing operations, it is equipped with a high-frequency 
(25,000 rpm) 16-kW head. 
  Naturally, the Germans are not the only ones to have 
developed high-speed industrial machines. After several years of 
research, Forest Line is offering two lines of portal milling 
machines, both equipped with a 25-kW spindle running at up to 
30,000 rpm. Their main applications are in the finishing of 
molds or pressing dies. An expert at Forest Line says: "Compared 
to a conventional machining cycle, we have reduced the total 
fabricating time by half and even two-thirds in the case of 
complex workpieces." That gain is due partly to faster cutting 
speed and partly to improvements in the geometry and surface 
condition that eliminate the need for manual polishing. 
High-speed machining is not limited to large workpieces. For 
working with small items, Switzerland's Mikron has designed its 
line of HSM machines. They use the architecture of portal 
milling machines and are equipped with high-speed spindles 
capable of running at up to 75,000 rpm in finishing operations. 
  The machining of hard materials, steel in particular, is the 
object of research by manufacturers. One objective is to 
eliminate the grinding phases by machining with the CBN [cubic 
boron nitride] tool. With that in mind, the Hembrug firm 
unveiled its Slantbed-Mikroturn 100-CNC, a highly accurate lathe 
capable of producing workpieces with a tolerance better than 1 
micron and a surface roughness (Ra) of less than one-tenth of a 
micron in hard steels of 60 to 62 Hv. That performance is 
achieved by the use in particular of a Num 1060 numerical 
control system connected to a measuring device permitting a 
resolution of 0.01 micron. A spindle mounted on a gas bearing 
and hydrostatic guides complete the picture. Even more original 
is Kugler's latest offering, the Hydro-air HP-100, which is also 
outstanding in achieving tolerances down to one-tenth of a 
micron and even less. Movement is achieved using linear motors. 
Guiding is handled through the harmonious combination of a 
hydrostatic journal bearing that absorbs stresses and a gas 
bearing that provides high-speed guidance. 
  Innovations also exist in other areas besides that of 
machining with the aid of cutting tools. Charmilles Technologies 
unveiled a new concept in the field of electrical discharge 
machining [EDM]: spark machining by milling. This technique 
combines EDM for forming holes with milling. It uses a system of 
traveling standard cylindrical electrodes to machine the 
workpiece layer by layer. It is no longer necessary to cut 
graphite electrodes in complex forms. "The more complex the 
workpiece, the larger the gain in productivity," says Jean 
Martin, marketing director for Charmilles Technologies. 
  New products for sheet metal work also seem to be synonymous 
with productivity. In the case of Finn-Power, that productivity 
is the result of the impact capacities of its new generation of 
nibbling and punching machine, which achieves and exceeds 1,000 
cps per minute in nibbling operations and over 500 cps per 
minute in punching operations. For its part, Mazak Nissho Iwai 
is focusing on the feed system in its laser cutting tables (now 
with stationary optics). The system consists of a fork whose 
teeth, spaced 50 mm apart, pass between the notches on the 
table, making it possible to unload workpieces automatically if 
they are at least 100 mm long. "Stopping time is comparable to 
that with a table using mobile optics and equipped with a 
palletization system," emphasizes Xavier Rouchaud, marketing 
director for Europe. 
<H5>  Increased Productivity </H5>
  To increase the productivity of bending presses, Amada is 
offering a handling robot that can replace a night crew. 
Suitable for small pieces (from 15 mm to 350 mm), this robot on 
rollers can be placed in front of any kind of press. It is a 
solution that can be considered when retrofitting a machine. 
  For its part, Trumpf is presenting a punching/bending unit 
combining a Trumatic 500 Rotation punching machine with a 
"panneauteuse" manufactured by the Ras Company. This unit's high 
degree of automation and flexibility predestine it for the 
manufacture of workpieces in small and medium-size runs. 
  The Bokoe Company, a German PME [small or medium-size 
business] specializing in the manufacture of flow turning 
machines, is offering a technology for generating boring without 
machining--a technology developed in cooperation with Chemnitz 
University. It consists of boring steel bars that are being 
rotated as though on a lathe. Two types of tools are necessary: 
The first, in cylindrical form, presses against the forward 
surface of the bar while the second, consisting of three 
tangentially placed knurling wheels, gradually crushes the 
periphery of the bar. The operation is comparable to turning on 
a lathe, but without the removal of cuttings. It produces a 
hollow form matching the geometry of the first tool. Smooth or 
grooved holes can be produced in this manner in a single pass. 
Moreover, the surfaces of the bores are similar to those 
obtained by grinding. 
<H5>  Machining Centers At Affordable Prices </H5>
  Not everyone is looking for sophistication. The American 
giant Cincinnati, for example, is aiming at the market for 
"cheap" machining centers with its new Arrow line. Despite a 
price below 400,000 francs, these machines possess very 
interesting characteristics: a displacement speed of 12 meters 
per minute, accuracy of plus or minus 4 microns, a spindle speed 
of up to 6,000 rpm, and a 21-tool changer. This machining center 
is equipped with a specific but nevertheless high-performance 
numerical control system. The American firm is not the only one 
exploring this niche in the market: Switzerland's Mikron 
unveiled its new VCE line, which has very similar architecture.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonio Guetierrez: "CHESF Considers Russian </F>
Technology for Increasing Power by Adding Cables"] 
  [Text] Recife--The Sao Francisco Hydroelectric Company 
(CHESF) is considering the adoption of a new transmission line 
technology that will enable it to increase power without having 
to replace substation equipment. 
  The system was developed in Russia and is being transferred 
to the Eletrobras system under an agreement signed in 1992 
between that Brazilian government-owned firm and the Leningrad 
Polytechnic Institute. The cost of this new method is limited to 
the salary of Russian Prof. Georgiy Podporkin, who has been in 
Brazil since January to pass on the technical know-how concerned. 
  The new technology, known as High Natural Power Line (LPNE), 
is available to all the firms in the Eletrobras system. So far, 
only Furnas and the CHESF are thinking of introducing the new 
system. In the West, only Cuba uses this technology, according 
to Eng. Oswaldo Regis, Jr., of the CHESF Engineering and 
Construction Department. 
  LPNE makes it possible to increase the power of a 
transmission line (which in Brazil uses the three-phase system) 
by adding more cables in asymmetrical positions to each of those 
phases. The positions are determined by computer calculations. 
The asymmetrical system makes it possible to double the natural 
power on the line by adding a second cable for each phase or to 
triple the power with a third cable. For example, the power of a 
230-kilovolt (kV) line can be increased from 130 megawatts (MW) 
of natural power to 260 MW (with two conductors per phase) or to 
360 MW with three conductors. 
  Under the traditional system, which is the one currently 
used 
by the national electricity grid, power is also increased by 
adding more cables, but in symmetrical positions. Increasing the 
number of cables in symmetrical positions does not result in a 
significant increase in power. On a 230-kV line, for example, 
adding one more cable increases the natural power from 130 MW to 
170 MW, or 30 percent, according to Regis. 
  "In symmetrical distribution, one conductor always has a 
higher electric field than another, while in asymmetrical 
distribution, the conductors have an equalized electric field, 
resulting in a larger power gain," Regis explains. 
  He admits that the technology is simple--"a real Columbus' 
egg"--and that the mathematical computations can be made with a 
small computer. The CHESF's only concern in adopting the new 
system on a commercial scale has to do with the possible 
mechanical effects on the pylons and with the fittings for 
holding the conductors. 
  To study those effects, the CHESF will energize a 1.6-km 
experimental line in Aldeia in the Recife metropolitan area 
within the next 30 days. The line is currently used for training 
purposes. "We intend to test the tripling of power on a 230-kV 
line," the CHESF engineer explains. The firm plans to install 
the LPNE system on a section of 230-kV commercial transmission 
line by 1994. That experiment will have the support of 
electrical equipment firms, which are to furnish the equipment. 
The cable will be supplied by the CHESF from inventory. "It is a 
way of reducing the cost of the experiment," says Regis. 
  Besides a greater increase in power, the LPNE system 
eliminates the need to invest in new equipment or substations. 
"The intention is to eliminate or postpone investments in new 
lines with higher voltages," Engineer Regis points out. 
"Increasing the voltage level by replacing equipment carries a 
higher cost." The cost of installing a 230-kV substation 
currently comes to around $7 million, while a 500-kV substation 
costs approximately $15 million."

  [Text] Next fiscal year the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corp. (PNC) will begin producing the interior 
equipment for a facility where technology for producing fuel for 
a demonstration advanced thermal reactor (ATR) will be 
developed. Although the construction of the facility's building 
within the Tokai Plant's plutonium fuel development facility 
ended in 1989, production of the equipment to go inside the 
facility was postponed for about five years because of the 
Electric Power Development Coordination Council's lack of 
progress in negotiations on the site for the demonstration ATR 
(electrical output: 606,000 kW). The plans are to build the 
demonstration ATR in Oma-machi, Aomori Prefecture. According to 
the STA Atomic Energy Bureau, the ATR fuel production line is to 
be completed within about five years, and then will supply 
uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for the demonstration 
ATR after the reactor is put through trial runs and completed. 
  The newly constructed demonstration ATR fuel production 
technology development facility is adjacent to the FBR fuel 
production line facility in the Tokai Plant's plutonium fuel 
third development building. The FBR line facility will produce 
the fuel for the initial loading of the prototype Monju FBR 
(electrical output: 280,000 kW; Tsuruga-shi, Fukui Prefecture). 
The ATR line building has a floor space of 5,000 m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; . 
  The new ATR line is to cope with the increase in MOX fuel 
supply accompanying the development of the demonstration reactor 
that will follow the prototype Fugen ATR (electrical output: 
165,000 kW; Tsuruga-shi, Fukui Prefecture). According to the 
plan, a 10-ton/year production line will be built. The goal is 
to increase the capacity by 20 tons/year after completion of the 
demonstration reactor and to ultimately have a 30-ton/year line. 
Along with the completion of the new ATR line, the second 
development building, which up until now has produced the fuel 
bodies for Fugen exchange, is to change over into a base 
facility for R&amp;D of fuel production technology. 
  Remote manipulation technology and automatic operation 
technology will be brought into the new ATR fuel production line 
to automate nearly everything except maintenance operations. In 
addition, preparations for the construction of the new 
demonstration reactor continue to be made, e.g., the basic 
design for safety inspections is complete. Construction is 
expected to begin in 1996 and operations to start in 2002.

  [Text] The Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (chairman, Takashi 
Mukaibo) reported the results of the Japan-France Experts' 
Meeting that was held for three days starting on 4 October in 
the Monro [phonetic] region of Southern France. During the 
meeting the two sides discussed nuclear fuel cycle policies, and 
agreed upon the content of the following joint declaration: 
"Regarding the substances generated and processed in all stages 
of the production cycle, the nuclear power industry, like other 
industries, will use all of the valuable substances and will use 
the best possible methods to process and dispose of the final 
waste." The two sides also agreed upon their joint declarations 
relating to fast breeder reactor (FBR) development, the 
development of uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, and 
other related issues. 
  Attending that meeting from the Japanese side were 
representatives from electric power companies, manufacturers, 
research organizations, and the government; the leader of the 
group was Hiroshi Matsuta, vice-chairman of the Japan Atomic 
Industrial Forum. Participants from the French side included R. 
Kall [phonetic], vice-president of France's electric power 
agency (EDF), and concerned parties from France's Atomic Energy 
Agency (CEA).

Monju FBR (rated output, 28 kW; located in in Tsuruga-shi, Fukui 
Prefecture), the initial criticality of which is scheduled for 
April 1994, the PNC loaded neutron source fuel assemblies into 
reactor core and began criticality tests on 12 October. The task 
of loading the reactor core fuel assemblies (198 assemblies) is 
to begin today, 13 October. 
  The objectives of the criticality tests are to load the fuel 
and achieve initial criticality, and then to perform the initial 
core configuration. The tests will continue until next June, 
then the PNC plans to shift into core physical tests, in which 
the reactivity values of the control rods (which regulate the 
reactor's output) will be measured.

  [Text] On 13 October, two days after Russian President 
Yeltsin came to Japan, the governments of Japan and Russia 
signed agreements of cooperation in the fields of atomic energy 
and space science and technology. In the area of atomic energy, 
Japan and Russia will cooperate in research on the peaceful use 
of the excess plutonium generated with the dismantling of 
nuclear weapons, a security measure system, etc. In space 
science and technology, the aim is to set up new joint research 
projects using large-scale test facilities and the excellent 
data that Russia has accumulated from global observations and 
manned space activities. The idea is to further advance science 
and technology cooperation between Japan and Russia that makes 
the best use of Japan's technological strength and knowledge. 
  In the field of atomic energy, Japan and Russia signed an 
agreement relating to the abolition of nuclear weapons. It is a 
plan for cooperation in four areas: 1) research on the storage 
and peaceful use of the nuclear substances resulting from the 
dismantling of nuclear weapons; 2) assistance in the application 
of IAEA security measures to former Soviet-bloc nations without 
nuclear weapons; 3) countermeasures against environmental 
pollution, such as the disposal of radioactive wastes in the 
ocean; and 4) countermeasures against missile liquid fuel 
dumping. 
  The other agreement on space cooperation included 
cooperation 
such as 1) researcher and engineer exchange, 2) information 
exchange, and 3) joint research in the area of space probing and 
utilization for peaceful purposes. 
  Only the space cooperation agreement has a time limit; it is 
valid for five years.

  [Text] The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) provided 
information about boiling water reactor (BWR) nuclear power 
plants to China's Second Design Academy, which deals with 
electrical power technology for non-commercial use. In China, 
all of the power plants that are in operation or are planned are 
the pressurized water reactor (PWR) type, but the course from 
now on is to deal with BWR power plants. To Hitachi, Toshiba, 
General Electric of the U.S., and other companies that deal with 
BWRs, a new market will open for nuclear power plants in the 
1,000-megawatt class, one of which costs &yen;300 to 500 
billion. To TEPCO, as well, the effect of mass production will 
lead to lower costs in the introduction of nuclear power. 
  Of the different types of BWRs, China shows interest in the 
advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR), which has simplified 
mechanics and keeps construction costs down. TEPCO told China 
about the features of an ABWR: 1) the reactor housing vessel and 
reactor building are small, and 2) the thermal efficiency is 
1.1&percnt; higher than that of a conventional BWR. TEPCO is 
building 
an ABWR, which was jointly developed by TEPCO, Hitachi, Toshiba, 
and GE, at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa power plant (Kashiwazaki-shi; 
output: 1,356 kW). 
  Because the transmission and transformer systems in China 
are 
small--Chinese-produced steam turbines are 
600,000-kW-class--they are not the 1,000,000-kW-class 
large-scale equipment as in Japan, so even with ABWRs China 
wants 600,000-kW-class mid-scale reactors. 
  China's independently developed Qinshan No. 1 reactor will 
go 
into operation next year. Then, the Qinshan No. 2 and No. 3 
reactors, and the Guangdong No. 1 and No. 2 reactors, the 
technology for which is being introduced from France, are under 
construction. All of those are PWRs. There is also a plan 
underway to build a nuclear power plant in Liaoning Province 
based on a nuclear power plant construction cooperation 
agreement with Russia. That will also use a PWR. However, 
limiting all nuclear power to PWRs apparently was judged as not 
good for national policy. 
  China's route is to provide about 10&percnt; of its 
electricity 
with nuclear power by 2010, and for that it will need 20 to 30 
nuclear power plants. There is a high possibility that China 
will become a huge market for the nuclear power industry.

  [Text] Looking at the Electric Power Development 
Coordination Council's goals until 2002, about 28&percnt; of 
FY99's 
approximately 900 trillion kW is calculated as necessary. 
Analyses show that a yearly growth of 2.5&percnt; is needed, and 
that 
nuclear power plants must also be equipped for up to 54 million 
kW. Nuclear power, which is essential for energy security, 
already plays the role of supporting the way of life in Japan. 
It supports the information society, keeps industry stable, and 
guarantees a comfortable way of life. This concept of energy 
security is also the basis of Japan's government policies on 
atomic energy, and it is essential for changing the weak nature 
of energy so that energy can be ensured into the future. Japan 
has been involved with nuclear power since the Atomic Energy Act 
was instituted in January 1956, 11 years after the war. That law 
is based on the policies that atomic energy is to be "limited to 
peaceful uses," "premised on the guarantee of safety," "managed 
democratically," and that "its results are to be made public." 
It was also a decision made by Japan, one of the world's most 
"nuclear-allergic" countries. 
  Japan's atomic energy development started with enriching 
uranium and then burning it as fuel in boiling water reactors 
(BWRs), pressurized-water reactors (PWRs), or high-temperature 
gas reactors. Later, while using the plutonium made in those 
reactors, Japan went on to convert depleted uranium (U-239), 
which was not used before, into plutonium and use it in fast 
breeder reactors, from which the amount of energy produced 
(plutonium) is more than the amount consumed (plutonium). 
Furthermore, Japan is following the road to nuclear fusion 
reactors. Atomic energy utilization plans that involve the use 
of plutonium, in particular, form the basis of the government's 
atomic energy policy, and that sort of plan has been emphasized 
since the beginning of Japan's atomic energy development. The 
reason for the promotion of that government policy is first and 
foremost the effective use of resources: (1) The uranium 
resources that become nuclear reactor fuel are presumed to be in 
"reserves of about the same amount as petroleum reserves," and 
are limited. In another hundred years or so, when the 
economically offsetting uranium can no longer be mined, that 
amount is estimated to be two and four million tons. This 
uranium is not just for use by Japan and the other wealthy 
countries whose atomic energy development is advanced; with the 
rate of economic development in developing countries, we can see 
how after a while countries will no longer be able to use 
uranium freely. (2) Using plutonium can be 10 or more times 
efficient than using uranium. Trial calculations show that the 
approximately 70-years worth of uranium reserves can be expanded 
to 3,600-years worth. That is the big reason for using plutonium. 
  The results of developments in plutonium utilization are 
bearing fruit: in the 31st year, next April the Monju reactor, 
which uses plutonium for fuel to generate electricity, is to 
reach criticality. With that, the development of reactors that 
use plutonium will be all the more definite. That is also the 
way to skip ahead to the forefront of atomic energy development, 
given the waning interest in such development with the new 
Clinton administration in the U.S. 
  This use of plutonium is not something that the world 
welcomes, as the plutonium-transporting ship the "Akatsuki Maru" 
experienced this January. There are also highly vocalized 
misgivings about plutonium use that links to nuclear weapons. To 
clear away such doubts, Japan has already made clear its 
position on the need for plutonium-fuel-based reactor 
development. Japan is also actively working to make sure that 
the development is limited to peaceful uses and is transparent 
enough to be understood. 
  In electric power generation by means of light-water and 
other such reactors, plutonium produced within the fuel rods 
provides one-third of the electric power generation. When a 
light-water reactor operates, plutonium is turned naturally into 
energy for electric power, and that amount reaches up to 
one-tenth of the total amount of electric power produced by 
thermoelectric, hydroelectric, and other power plants. 
  Using plutonium seriously involves even more active 
utilization of the plutonium produced within nuclear reactors. 
The way to do that is to remove plutonium (in a state in which 
it is mixed with uranium) from spent fuel, then to burn it in a 
special kind of reactor, a fast breeder reactor (FBR), and also 
to use the plutonium in combination with BWR and PWR fuels. 
  With the fuels for nuclear reactors, centering on 
light-water 
reactors, only a mere 1&percnt; of the burnable uranium 
(uranium-235) 
contained in the uranium ore can be utilized. The remaining 
99&percnt; 
is unburnable uranium (uranium-239) that is discarded. 
  The use of plutonium has two aspects: converting that 
unburnable uranium into plutonium with a special reactor like 
the Monju, and then actively using that plutonium; and, using 
the plutonium produced in the fuel rods of light-water reactors. 
Establishing the technology for that will lead to achieving the 
goals of expanding uranium usage by 10 or more times, and 
Japan's creation of a new, man-made energy. 
  The first stage in the serious use of plutonium is the Power 
Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.'s Monju FBR. That 
reactor, whose technology is based on the 100,000-kW Joyo 
experimental reactor that reached criticality in 1977, is 
Japan's first FBR for electric power generation. Construction of 
the Monju reactor, which will have an electrical output of 
280,000 kW, started in October 1985. In 1991 equipment 
installation was completed, and comprehensive testing concluded, 
and on 13 October the initial fuel loading was carried out. 
Criticality is expected to happen in April 1994. 
  Furthermore, there is also a demonstration reactor project 
underway to develop a commercial FBR based on Monju technology, 
and the conceptual design for that is already completed. The 
demonstration reactor, which is being developed by the Japan 
Atomic Power Co., will have an electrical output of 1 million 
kW, and the cost of its construction will be 1.5 times that of a 
light-water reactor. The construction of this demonstration 
reactor is seen as a project with a definite time period, even 
in the Long-Term Atomic Energy Development and Utilization Plan 
that is being written this year. The plutonium utilization route 
will become certain. 
  In addition, the private-sector started the construction of 
a 
reprocessing plant that will be the deciding factor of the 
nuclear fuel cycle; the reprocessing plant will supply plutonium 
fuel to the FBRs that are under development. Ground preparations 
are now being made for the reprocessing plant, which will be in 
the Rokkasho reprocessing plant that the Japan Nuclear Fuel Co. 
is building in Rokkasho-mura, Aomori Prefecture. The 
reprocessing plant is to start operating in 2000 and will have 
the capacity to reprocess the spent nuclear fuel from about 30 
1-million-kW power plants (800 tons per year). The plan is for 
the plant to produce about 50 tons of plutonium by 2010. 
  The plant will use a wet method (the Purex method) to 
dissolve spent fuel in nitric acid and then separate the 
uranium, plutonium, and fission products. In order to prevent 
the plutonium from being converted into nuclear weapons, the 
plutonium and uranium will be in an oxide state and will be 
removed just as they are, mixed in a one-to-one ratio. 
  The reprocessing plant will be a plant that takes nuclear 
nonproliferation into consideration. At the same time, to answer 
any doubts, extra care will be taken to guarantee the control of 
nuclear substances, and the emphasis will be on a management 
system in which there will be no extraction of plutonium from 
the production process and no plutonium with an unknown 
destination. The STA is also giving serious consideration to 
security measures for the reprocessing plant; in the budget for 
next fiscal year it will establish an industrial-level nuclear 
substance management system by putting the "Security Measures 
Center" next to the plant. The STA is developing containment 
surveillance equipment that will enable management without a 
supervisor present, and weighing devices that take inspection 
into account. 
  In addition to the reprocessing plant, there are other 
facilities in Rokkasho-mura. A uranium enrichment plant is in 
operation; by about this winter uranium produced there will be 
shipped for the first time. There is also an underground 
low-level radioactive waste center, which processes the 
low-level radioactive waste generated by power plants, that went 
into operation in December 1992. A high-level radioactive waste 
management facility, which will store high-level radioactive 
waste generated from domestic and overseas reprocessing, is now 
under construction. The task of equipping the main facilities 
for a nuclear fuel cycle is steadily progressing. 
  Japan also emphasizes the important safety issues that go 
along with atomic energy development. Facilities for nuclear 
fuel cycle safety engineering research are also being equipped. 
Those facilities are involved in research on the prevention of 
severe accidents in pressurized-water-type light-water reactors 
that use a large non-stationary state loop (LSTF) (the ROSA-V 
project), test research on reactivity accidents using a nuclear 
safety research reactor (NSRR), and the evaluation of nuclear 
fuel facilities. 
  The results achieved in this atomic energy development reach 
world-class levels and are coming to the point where Japan will 
assert how a management system should be in issues such as 
managing the excess plutonium generated from the dismantling of 
nuclear weapons. At the 37th General Meeting of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, STA Director General Eda 
clearly stated that, because of Japan's energy situation, Japan 
will not bypass nuclear power and will utilize plutonium for 
strictly peaceful purposes. Japan made clear to the rest of the 
world that, despite the change in the administration, the new 
government will take over the atomic energy development that has 
taken place thus far in Japan. Then, in regard to a system of 
international management of plutonium, which draws the most 
concern in the world, Japan announced its strong intention to 
play an international role. This way of thinking, i.e., to 
increase transparency by making clear the plans for using 
plutonium for peaceful purposes and the whereabouts of the 
plutonium, is backed by Japan's long period of atomic energy 
development for peaceful purposes. At the brink of the 21st 
century, the world's economy will grow more, and the energy used 
by developing countries will increase. The development and 
utilization of atomic energy is seen as something to accelerate, 
and Japan's history will be a model.

  [Text] (Fukuoka) Part-way through production, there is a 
giant mass of metal--actually, it is a steam generator that will 
be used in a nuclear power plant. It is one of the two steam 
generators that will replace those in the Kyushu Electric Power 
Co.'s Genkai nuclear power plant (Shige Ono, company president), 
the construction work for which is to start in May 1994. 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industry entered into the final stage of the 
production of the steam generator at its Kobe shipyard. 
  This steam generator, called the "52F model," is the newest 
type of steam generator. It is 21 meters high and is made of an 
alloy of nickel, chrome, and iron. The ratio of chrome is higher 
than in conventional types of steam generators, so it will 
resist corrosion better. In addition, the steam generator has 
three fittings, instead of the usual two, to hold down the 
vibration of the 3,000 and some heat-exchange pipes that shake 
because of the energy when steam and water rise in the 
generator, and the materials of the fittings were changed to 
increase safety. 
  The steam generator of the Genkai No. 1 plant will be 
replaced this time because damage in the heat-exchange pipes 
continues to occur. A training center was set up in the Kobe 
shipyard in April so that the steam generator replacement work 
will be done safely. Although most of the actual work will be 
done outside by remote operation, the replacement of the steam 
generator is being rehearsed over and over because the steam 
generator replacement work that will start in December, 1993, at 
the Kansai Electric Power Co.'s Mihama No. 1 plant will be the 
first such replacement in Japan.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corp.'s (PNC) Monju fast breeder reactor (FBR) (electrical 
output: 280,000 kW) is situated on a plateau facing the Sea of 
Japan half-way up a ria coast at the tip of the Tsuruga 
Peninsula in Fukui Prefecture. In April, 1991, the PNC finished 
installing the reactor's equipment. The PNC now looks toward the 
first criticality as it enters into the final round of tests. 
  The tests are to check the sodium coolant flow and other 
such 
values to confirm that they match the design values. That data 
will be indispensable in obtaining other nuclear data from 
reactor physical tests after criticality is reached, and will 
contribute greatly in the detailed design of the No. 1 
demonstration FBR that the electric power industry (the Japan 
Atomic Power Co.) will build in the near future. 
  The design of the Monju started 25 years ago, and the 
results 
of operating the Joyo demonstration FBR (Oarai-machi, Ibaraki 
Prefecture) were used to the utmost in constructing the Monju. 
The Monju is actually the fruition of a quarter century of 
development efforts. Unlike power generated by light-water 
reactor that use water as a coolant, the Monju uses sodium. This 
is the first such nuclear power generation. Although the Monju 
is the fifth reactor of its kind, following prototype FBRs in 
France, the UK, and Russia (two), the facilities are the newest 
and best. Even France has used the Monju's sodium fire 
prevention measures as a reference and is now making repairs to 
its Super Phoenix so that it can resume operation of the reactor. 



  The Monju uses sodium, but to prevent accidents, leakage, 
and 
fires, air is expelled from the inside of the reactor housing 
vessel, in which both the primary and secondary systems are 
located, and the inside of the reactor housing vessel has an 
atmosphere of inactive nitrogen. Because the periphery of the 
reactor cannot be seen, this was the last chance to report about 
the site that will be pressed with tests before criticality. 
<H5>  A "High-Tech Castle" Made By Pulling the Pieces Over a Roller </H5>
  A private bay where large, heavy objects are unloaded from 
ships can be seen below the plateau half-way up the ria coast. 
Since construction of the Monju began on 25 October 1985, all 
the equipment and materials, such as that for the housing vessel 
installation (completed in April 1987) and the reactor vessel 
installation (completed in October 1988), have been brought up 
from the private bay. The number of transport ships that entered 
the bay is 119; in terms of weight, about 200,000 tons. Because 
of all that the "high-tech castle" is completed today. To get 
from the private bay to the site you have to travel about 1.2 km 
up a sloping road. Bringing the 280-ton reactor vessel up to the 
site took four days (starting on 11 October 1988). The scene of 
the cautious, 1-meter/minute pulling of the reactor vessel over 
a roller, like the construction of the Pyramids in ancient 
Egypt, is unforgettable. 
  An event of 19 years came to mind while I was looking up at 
the "castle" from the bay. The delay of the start of operation 
of the completed Joyo demonstration reactor, the parent of 
Monju's construction, due to design re-evaluation (October to 
December 1974) was a "gift." So as not to repeat the mistake of 
the Mutsu nuclear-powered ship, on which a radiation leak 
occurred in the summer of that year, the decision was made to 
have a comprehensive inspection of the facilities. Needless to 
say, during the 16 years of Joyo operation that followed, there 
were no accidents, though various troubles occurred in the 
stages of experimental reactors in advanced countries that had 
started 10 years earlier than Japan. Sodium leakage, which is 
the FBR's weak point, did not occur, and as many as 50,031 fuel 
rods have been burned so far with not a single rod showing any 
damaged fuel. That was because the Mutsu was a "bad example" 
from which much was learned. 
  Returning back to the present, the first criticality of the 
Monju was changed for the third time from "October criticality" 
to next spring because of the troubles with the fuel pellet 
sintering furnace (Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture) that delayed 
the production of the remaining 15&percnt; of the total fuel for 
the 
Monju. That happening truly shows the one-and-indivisible 
relationship between the "reactor" and the "nuclear fuel cycle." 
  A look at the recent trends in the Atomic Energy 
Commission's 
FBR Development Project Special Subcommittee, which is now 
discussing future measures for making FBRs practical that 
include the No. 1 demonstration reactor project, shows that the 
nuclear power industry should use as material for deepening its 
self-awareness the fact that MITI and part of the electric power 
industry only see "reactors" and are lacking in consideration 
toward the "nuclear fuel cycle." And, the PNC should effectively 
use the date when it came to the surface as a bad example, as in 
the past example of the Joyo reactor. 
<H3>  Engineer Spirit Making the Most of a Once-in-1,000-Years 
Chance </H3>
  During the busiest phase of the construction there were as 
many as 4,000 workers at the site. Recently, the total number of 
workers dropped to 400; 200 people are PNC employees, including 
80 people from 10 electric power companies, and 200 people are 
from collaborating companies. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is 
tense as can be with the 400 workers conducting overall 
inspections of all the machinery and equipment before the task 
of loading 198 fuel assemblies into the core. 
  The 80 people from the electric power industry are the 
necessary operations and maintenance personnel for future FBR 
electric power generation. For four years already they have been 
permanently stationed at the Monju, and there are 10 young 
electric power men burning with the engineer spirit who have 
been working at the plant since the construction stage. There 
will be a five-man system in which two men will be electric 
power men; one of the two has experience operating a gas 
reactor, a boiling water reactor, and pressurized-water reactor. 
They are all impressed that the frontier for unfolding Japan's 
nuclear power policies is in their region. "They all should be 
proud to not pass by this once-in-a-thousand-years chance--the 
startup of Japan's first FBR electric power generation," 
mentioned Plant Division No. 2 Chief Maeda. 
  Next I will present a few of the results from the tests thus 
far. The first is an example that shows that the nuclear reactor 
system is a "large-scale precision machine." The fuel 
transporter weighs about 450 tons, and the precision when the 
fuel moves on the 80m-long rail at 5m/sec then stops is +/-1mm. 
During fuel exchange it will be entirely automated. The 
transporter moves precisely to the targeted fuel and is the 
indispensable basis for accurately bringing fuel into and out of 
the reactor. 
  The next result comes from the preliminary plant 
characteristics tests that have been carried out since early 
this year. The tests involved circulating sodium in the pipes of 
the primary and secondary systems. The temperature of the sodium 
was raised to 200&deg;C with an external heater, then when the 
sodium was circulated by means of a pump, the pump's rotational 
energy was transmitted, and it was confirmed that the 
temperature of the sodium entering the reactor core rose to 
400&deg;C due to the frictional heating. When the Monju actually 
generates power, the sodium flowing in the pipes will be at a 
temperature of 530&deg;C. However, even without using an "atomic 
fire," the stage where it is alright to raise the temperature 
another 130&deg;C has already been reached. "With this, it looks 
quite certain that there will be no problems with Monju 
operation after the first criticality," says Director Tadao 
Takahashi optimistically. 
<H5>  "International Stage" With France, UK, US, and Germany </H5>
  Because the Monju is the newest kind of prototype reactor, 
it 
has already attracted the attention of advanced countries. 
Concretely, two French men who have experience operating 
France's Super Phoenix reactor and an English couple who have 
operated the British PFR are permanently stationed at the Monju 
and take part in all of the tests. It has also been decided that 
one person from the U.S. and one person from Germany will be 
included in the near future. It is becoming an "international 
stage" geared toward the practical use of FBRs. International 
exchange is also vigorous: in the evening after their work is 
finished, the Japanese workers receive French language lessons 
from the French men. Despite the talk about a worldwide slowdown 
in FBR development, Director Takahashi says, "Just because it 
looks at first sight as if a slowdown is occurring because of 
each country's social and economic situations, that does not 
mean that it will be choked off altogether." That is because 
countries will be preparing for the age around the middle of the 
21st century when energy resources will start to dry up. 
  Japan, which long ago lagged behind in development, is now 
in 
a position to move to the top in the world. "Like skating, Japan 
is in the position of `responsibility foremost,' and firmly 
senses its international responsibility," emphasizes Director 
Takahashi. 
  Recently in France troubles with the prototype and 
demonstration reactors have continued, and the restart of the 
Super Phoenix's operation has been politically delayed. With the 
aim of starting operations in the middle of next year, political 
procedures and repair work are progressing. One example of that 
is the sodium fire prevention measures, which were thoroughly 
investigated by anti-nuclear groups. The Super Phoenix's 
secondary system is now undergoing repairs. Frankly speaking, 
that is something France learned by watching Japan. 
  In the Monju's reactor housing vessel where sodium will flow 
in the primary and secondary system pipes, the air will be 
expelled and replaced with inactivated nitrogen gas. Even if 
there is a leak, the reactor is devised so that it will not 
naturally ignite. There is also a double safety measure: metal 
covers the floor, walls, and ceiling. 
  In contrast, such safety measures are not provided for in 
the 
pipes of the Super Phoenix's secondary system, and that became 
its "ruin." Through Japanese-French atomic energy exchange, 
France is learning from Japan and is now doing repair work on 
the Super Phoenix. 
  Getting back to domestic issues, since 2 September 1992 the 
Atomic Energy Commission of Japan has been looking ahead to the 
middle of the next century in discussing revisions to the 
"Long-Term Atomic Energy Utilization and Development Plan." 
Whether or not it reflects the trends in France and other 
countries, MITI and part of the electric power industry are 
taking a "wait and do nothing" attitude about practical use. 
Nevertheless, "pleading words" directed to the Atomic Energy 
Commission were heard from the Monju's head ranks, including the 
site supervisors. "Please decide the route of FBR development. 
The important thing is the succession of the technology."

  [Text] The Japanese government decided to move to aid 
Russia in wiping out nuclear weapons. It looks like the two 
countries will formally sign an agreement on aid in the 
dismantling of nuclear weapons during President Yeltsin's visit 
to Japan on 11 October, and a committee geared toward 
implementing the aid plan will be started in Tokyo. Furthermore, 
cooperation in surveying the problem of radioactive waste 
dumping into the ocean and other such support will continue to 
steadily expand to Russia. While proceeding with territorial 
negotiations, it is essential that the Japanese government, 
which takes the route of "expanded equilibrium" as the basis of 
its dealings with Russia, makes an expression of aid to Russia 
and implements that without any problems. Given that Japan has 
no experience in the area of nuclear abolition aid, there is 
increasing concern about the success or failure of such an 
effort. 
  The agreement for aid in abolishing nuclear weapons that 
President Yeltsin will sign when he comes to Japan is a part of 
the voluntary aid to Russia that the government announced at the 
G7 meeting in Tokyo last April. On this occasion, Japan is 
declaring that it will provide about $100 million in gratuitous 
funding to four former-Soviet nations that posses nuclear 
weapons--Russia, Ukraine, Byelarus, and Kazakhstan--and is 
negotiating separate agreements with the four countries. Russia 
will be the first to receive this bilateral aid. 
  Japan's aid to Russia in the dismantling of nuclear weapons 
comes later than other countries such as the U.S. and France, 
which are already proceeding with bilaterally based assistance. 
The prospect is for the aid plan to be implemented within the 
year under a committee jointly created by Japan and Russia. 
  The main areas in which Japan will provide aid are the 
construction of storage facilities for storing and managing 
plutonium and other nuclear substances resulting from the 
dismantling of nuclear weapons, the elimination of radioactive 
pollution around nuclear facilities, and assistance in medical 
treatment for radiation injuries. Japan will also send experts 
to Russia for technical guidance and will provide needed 
equipment such as radioactivity detectors. 
  Japan's policy is not to participate in the actual 
dismantling of nuclear weapons because that would contradict the 
"triple nonnuclear principle." Although the areas of assistance 
are limited, the government's standpoint, according to a 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) source, is that "there is the 
way to make the most of Japan's unique character, because Japan 
is second to none when it comes to technology and research on 
the safe management and peaceful utilization of nuclear 
substances." A nonnuclear country, Japan's promotion of other 
countries' peaceful use of nuclear materials "is significant in 
that it appeals to a position of contributing to the world's 
peace and nuclear nonproliferation." 
  Furthermore, Japan's technical and financial assistance in 
the construction of nuclear storage facilities will also 
contribute greatly toward halting Russia's dumping of 
radioactive waste into the sea. Japan fears the marine pollution 
and the effects on marine life due to the former Soviet Union's 
and Russia's dumping of radioactive waste into the sea. Although 
Japan wants an immediate stop put to the dumping of liquid 
waste, Russia cannot comply with the request because of its lack 
of preparedness, such as poorly equipped storage facilities. 
Because of that, too, the need to speed up the aid is indicated. 
  Given such a background, both the Japanese and Russian 
governments agree that the aid plan should be implemented soon. 
At first, the two governments were expecting that the agreement 
would be signed in June. That slipped more than three months 
because of the confrontation between the Russian government and 
parliament. 
  The fact is that negotiations between the two countries were 
stifled because the Russian parliament showed disaproval in 
response to Japan's request to include in the agreement the 
removal of tariffs on aid goods. Nevertheless, an MFA source 
says that "the prospects for signing the agreement look much 
better" because of Yelstin's bold action in dissolving the 
parliament on 21 September. 
  But, even if the agreement is signed, there is still a long 
road to implementation. "First, we ascertain what sort of 
support can Japan provide that will not overlap with the other 
countries already aiding Russia, and what sort of support does 
Russia want. Everything will go from there," says an MFA source. 
There are high hurdles to overcome before an outline of the 
implementation is created, people are selected to carry it out, 
and goods are sent. 
  Another thing that causes great concern is the situation 
within Russia. The aid is largely premised on the progress of 
Yeltsin's political and economic reforms, but, with the recent 
bloody incident, the aid's good cause was damaged, and some 
expect the brakes will be applied to the implementation of the 
aid. An MFA spokesman says that he "would like to move into 
implementing" the $100 million in voluntary aid that was decided 
in a supplementary budget last June "in some form or another, 
within the fiscal year." However, apparently that will be 
affected by the political trends within Russia.

  [Text] The 21st Century Technology and Energy Committee 
(chaired by Takao Kashiwagi, professor at the Tokyo University 
of Agriculture and Technology) reports that, with the 
establishment of an optimal nuclear fuel cycle involving new 
types of reactors and the practical application of large-volume 
electric power storage technology, nuclear power will account 
for 35&percnt; of Japan's primary energy supply by 2050. 
  The objectives of that committee are to assess and predict 
the practical possibilities of future energy technologies that 
are seen as important, e.g., atomic energy, solar power, 
hydrogen power, and to get a grasp on how Japan's energy supply 
and demand will appear 60 years from now. The following is how 
the committee's report depicts Japan's energy situation in 2010. 
  "The trend toward exhaustion of petroleum resources will be 
conspicuous, prices will rise, and those resources will be 
limited to noble uses such as for the chemical industry and 
transport." 
  "There will be calls for conversion to other energy sources 
because the regulations on CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions will be 
strengthened to prevent global warming. And, CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
recovery and processing will become more practical, though the 
costs will be high." 
  "There will be more dependence on solar energy, which is a 
perpetual source of energy. Because of that, basic changes in 
urban social systems and lifestyles will be needed." 
  "The development and utilization of renewable and clean 
energies will expand globally." "As for atomic energy, an 
optimal nuclear fuel utilization cycle involving new types of 
reactors will be established." "The practical use of humanity's 
most revolutionary energies (nuclear fusion, solar power 
generation in space) will become possible." 
  As a result of those, the committee estimates that the 
primary energy supply in 2010 will consist of 15&percnt; new 
energies, 
2-3&percnt; hydro power, 1&percnt; geothermal energy, 
30-35&percnt; atomic energy, 
15-17&percnt; natural gas power, and 13&percnt; petroleum 
energy. The total 
percentage of non-fossil-fuel energies is 55&percnt;. The key to 
that, 
however, is the "technology."

  [Text] As a response to a question by Lower House 
Representative Akiba (Socialist Democratic Party of Japan, first 
Hiroshima ward, elected for two terms) on 1 October, the Science 
and Technology Agency (STA) revealed details about the amount of 
Japan's plutonium supply and demand. It has disclosed some 
information in the past, but this is the first time that this 
information was disclosed in full, and is in response to demands 
for disclosure both in Japan and abroad. 
  According to the written response to Representative Akiba, 
the total amount of fissionable plutonium purchased from other 
countries and extracted in Great Britain, France and the Tokai 
reprocessing plant is about 8,230 kilograms (kg). 
  Of this, the stored amount, which excludes the amount 
already 
processed as fuel, is 4,500 kg. This includes 2,900 kg that is 
owned by Japanese electric power companies and is stored in 
Great Britain and France in the form of plutonium dioxide powder 
and 1,600 kg (in the form of plutonium dioxide powder) that is 
stored in Japan, of which 540 kg (as a mixed oxide (MOX) with 
uranium in powder form) was recovered at the Tokai reprocessing 
plant in Japan and 1,060 kg was transported from France on the 
Akatsuki-Maru last year. 
  At the Tokai reprocessing plant, about 724 tons of spent 
fuel 
has been processed and 2,925 kg of plutonium has been recovered. 
  A British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) reprocessing plant 
reprocessed 1,100 tons of spent fuel from the Tokai Number 1 gas 
reactor, and recovered 1,560 kg of plutonium. 
  At the reprocessing plant of the French COGEMA, the UP-2 
plant reprocessed 150 tons and recovered 780 kg, and the UP-3 
plant reprocessed 620 tons and recovered 2,480 kg. 
  The amount transported from abroad includes 980 kg from 
Great 
Britain and 1,250 kg from France. The price of plutonium that 
was transported on the Akatsuki-Maru and that the Power Reactor 
and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) bought from the 
Japanese electric power companies was &yen;1.13 billion. 
  Although the written response to Representative Akiba did 
not 
mention this, about 100 kg of plutonium was purchased from the 
United States and about 60 kg was purchased from the former West 
Germany. 
&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  As for use, 1,020 kg of fissionable plutonium is scheduled 
to 
be incorporated into the initial loading of core fuel by the 
fast breeder reactor "Monju." In terms of MOX, this is 6.7 tons. 
The plutonium transported by the Akatsuki-Maru is expected to be 
used in the manufacturing of replacement fuel from the summer of 
1994. 
  STA's Nuclear Fuel Division, which drew up the written 
response, maintains that STA always has disclosed as much 
information as possible and that this will not change in the 
future. 
<H3>  STA Policy Is To Release Detailed Documentation on 
Reprocessing Plant </H3>
  STA has decided to disclose the "application for approval of 
design and construction methods" for the returned waste control 
facility and the reprocessing facility, which Japan Nuclear Fuel 
is building in Rokkasho-Mura, Aomori Prefecture, to handle the 
high-level radioactive nuclear waste that is being returned to 
Japan from abroad. 
  STA and Japan Nuclear Fuel currently are coordinating on the 
disclosure site and on the handling of information that cannot 
be disclosed due to proprietary rights or protection of nuclear 
materials. They want to start the disclosure process within the 
year. 
  In June of this year, when the group of 10,000 filing action 
to prevent the nuclear fuel cycle (represented by Miyako 
Oshimoda, instructor of Hachinohe University) lodged a protest 
to STA about these two facilities, it demanded that the 
application for approval of design and construction methods be 
disclosed, on the grounds that the suit could not be filed 
without information about the content of the facility. In 
connection with nuclear power facilities, the Sendai district 
court already has ordered that the application for approval of 
construction of Tohoku Electric Power Company's Yasukawa Nuclear 
Power Plant be submitted, but this will be the first time that 
the national government has disclosed something as highly secret 
as the application for approval of design and construction 
methods.

  [Text] The handling of high-grade plutonium coming from the 
dismantling of nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union has 
become a big issue, and the Japan Atomic Energy Research 
Institute (JAERI) has almost completed basic research on a 
"once-through type plutonium fuel" in which Pu239 is 99&percnt; 
burned 
and annihilated in existing light water reactors (LWRs) and the 
spent fuel also will have almost the same stability as natural 
ore. JAERI explained the results of its research to the Japan 
Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC). 
  The plutonium from dismantlement, which is said to be about 
200 tons, is about 94&percnt; Pu239, and whether to utilize this 
for 
peaceful uses or put them under storage and control has become a 
topic of international debate. Since JAERI's once-through type 
fuel can be manufactured easily in existing fuel fabrication 
plants without dilution, and almost 100&percnt; of the Pu239 can 
be 
annihilated without building a separate mono-fuel combustion 
reactor, it probably will draw international interest as well. 
  JAERI emphasized three points in its research: (1) the fuel 
should be once-through type, and the spent fuel should become 
high level waste while kept in coated pipes and not have to be 
reprocessed or solidified; (2) from the viewpoint of stability 
of waste and use of fuel manufacturing technology, the fuel 
should be an oxide base; and (3) for purposes of safety, the 
fusion point of the fuel should be 2,000&deg; or more. 
  From this viewpoint, two types of "fluorite oxide fuel" have 
been nominated for a fuel with irradiation stability and fission 
product solid solubility and stability: (1) Thoria base 
(compound of plutonium, thorium and alumina) and (2) 
zirconia-gadolinia base (compound of plutonium, zirconium, 
gadolinium and alumina). Data showing that 99&percnt; 
annihilation of 
nuclear weapon grade Pu239 at about 60,000 MWD/ton burnup was 
achieved for both types. In terms of void coefficient, however, 
the thoria base fuel was negative, whereas the 
zirconia-gadolinia base fuel was positive (or greater excess 
reaction). 
  With this fuel, to increase plutonium burnup, the greater 
the 
proportion of cooling water to the cubic volume of reactor fuel 
the better. Therefore, existing LWRs with a 1.9 ratio or the 
VVER-1000 are better than fast reactors, and because fast 
reactors also have the characteristic of not burning up Pu239, 
the LWR is more advantageous in practical application of this 
fuel. Although a high-temperature gas reactor could be used, its 
plutonium load is about 2 tons, and it cannot burn more than the 
LWR's 6 tons. 
  Moreover, with once-through fuel, the spent fuel has more 
weathering stability than glassified waste after reprocessing, 
and can be buried as is (radioactivity is about the same). It is 
also maintained that this fuel can be manufactured in existing 
facilities because it is an oxide. 
  JAERI already has completed the basic study, and plans to 
continue research to find the optimum composition for the fuel. 
  The purpose of the once-through type fuel is burnup and 
annihilation of high-grade (94&percnt; pure) plutonium, and it 
is not 
directly applicable to Japan's fuel recycling system. However, 
the Science and Technology Agency is hoping that this effective 
technology will be "one option" for the peaceful use of 
plutonium from dismantlement, however. JAERI plans to unveil it 
at the "7th international conference on innovative nuclear 
energy systems," which will begin on 20 September at the 
Makuhari in Tokyo.

  [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC) plans to begin full-scale research with the 
goal of building a new recycling system concept (new 
reprocessing and recycling) that will "strengthen resistance to 
nuclear proliferation" by extraction without separating 
plutonium and uranium from transuranic element (TRU) nuclides. 
  In the current reprocessing method, extraction is carried 
out 
by separating plutonium and TRU. If fissile plutonium is mixed 
with TRU, however, it cannot be used in nuclear bombs. 
  For this reason, PNC wants to begin research to modify the 
existing method of light water reactor (LWR) reprocessing so 
that (1) TRU nuclides are not separated, (2) complete separation 
of uranium is not carried out, and (3) complete elimination of 
fission products is not carried out; and to use the unrefined 
plutonium (i.e., mixed with TRU) in a new fast reactor that can 
burn it. This process would be a new fuel cycle with greater 
nuclear proliferation resistance and, moreover, would make it 
possible to burn TRU, so the resulting reduction in TRU 
accumulation could be expected to contribute to reducing the 
burden on the environment. 
  Along with research on the recycling process as a whole, 
including the above modification, new reprocessing methods using 
technology to simultaneously burn and recycle plutonium and TRU, 
fuel fabrication, waste disposal and basic reactor concepts, PNC 
also plans to evaluate the features of the the cycle, such as 
plutonium/TRU balance in the recycle flow, degree of nuclear 
proliferation and environmental protection and economy. 
  In FY94, PNC wants to build the basic cycle concept and 
carry 
out the feature evaluations. Then, from FY95, it wants to move 
to cycle concept design research and development of element 
technologies. With regard to plutonium-TRU combustion 
technology, from FY94, PNC will carry out research on an 
advanced purex method that will not extract plutonium 
separately, and research on separation and recovery of TRU 
nuclides from nuclear waste. PNC also plans to carry out the 
following research projects: (1) analysis of characteristics of 
combustion of TRU in fast reactors and continuation of R&amp;D on 
TRU fuel manufacturing technology; (2) provision of equipment to 
recover materials needed for TRU fuel irradiation testing 
(americium, neptunium, etc.) and modification of existing cells 
to use in making TRU samples; and (3) study of concept of TRU 
research facility that can play a role in basic, fundamental TRU 
research (a long-lived nuclides research facility).

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Although over 25 years have passed since development began 
on 
superconducting magnetic levitation (maglev) rail systems, the 
steady stream of research results is at the verge of blossoming. 
As reflected in the recent name change from ultra high-speed 
rail to magnetic levitation rail, not only is high speed sought, 
but importance is placed on the low noise and ease of 
maintenance characteristics of a noncontact railway, which has a 
drive method that does not depend on adhesion, and on energy 
conservation by using lighter weight cars, which is a feature of 
a primary ground system (driving and controlling the car is 
mainly performed by ground facilities). 
  Since superconducting maglev rail possesses these superior 
qualities, it is awaited not only as a practical application of 
superconduction but as a new means of transportation for the 
next generation. 
<H5>  System Improvements </H5>
  Before development began at the Railway Technical Research 
Institute, the MLU002 test vehicle was completed in March 1987 
and began trial runs on the Miyazaki test track. However, 
quench, the state where superconductivity is not maintained, 
occurred frequently in the superconducting magnet, the most 
important element in superconducting magnetic levitation. 
Therefore to move closer to practical realization, the whole 
system was reviewed and improvements were made to the system by 
placing importance on stability and reliability. The 
improvements are as follows. 
  (1) From the perspective of the development level of the 
superconducting magnets, such as their durability and 
reliability, the surface propulsion coils are placed at two 
levels with a phase of 240&deg; where the electromagnetic effect 
on the superconducting magnet becomes small. 
  (2) To achieve improved reliability of the superconducting 
magnets and low magnetic field leakage into the cars, the pole 
pitch of the superconducting magnets is shortened. This action 
is taken because power supply conversion by a GTO inverter could 
be used. 
  (3) In order to increase energy savings, the method used is 
sidewall levitation where the levitation coils are shaped like 
the number eight and have small magnetic repulsive force 
(magnetic resistive force). A large levitation force is obtained 
by using sidewall levitation. 
  These system changes are planned for use in the Yamanashi 
test track. Therefore, final performance verification is being 
performed on the Miyazaki test track. 
<H5>  Recent Major Developments </H5>
  As explained earlier, the most important issue in 
implementing a maglev railway is improving the stability and 
reliability of the superconducting magnets. In order to solve 
this problem, the objective was to understand the quench 
phenomenon of superconducting magnets and suppress its 
occurrence in the magnets. With funds from all of the Japan 
Railways (JR) companies, surveys and tests were performed on the 
electromagnetic oscillation characteristics under a wide range 
of test conditions for superconducting magnets using 
electromagnetic oscillation test equipment. In addition, 
prototypes of the superconducting coil and magnet were made by 
JR Tokai. Quench resistance tests and electromagnetic 
oscillation tests were conducted in parallel. Through these 
tests, a great deal of new information was gained on the effect 
of electromagnetic oscillations on heat generation in the 
superconducting magnet section. Moreover, useful insight was 
gained on how to improve the characteristics of the 
superconducting magnet's response to electromagnetic 
disturbances. 
  The results of various tests and investigations demonstrated 
that the quench phenomenon is, for the most part, sliding 
friction heat between the inside groove and the coil caused by 
an external oscillating force. Superconducting magnets to be 
manufactured in the future will have sufficient margin in coil 
stability, stronger cross-sectional coil structures, and low 
current densities. This series of results is reflected in the 
design and manufacture of the superconducting magnets to be used 
in the newly constructed MLU002N test vehicle and the Yamanashi 
test vehicle. 
  The development of wheel disc brakes and tires that can be 
used from a speed of 500 km/h in the car and the development of 
an axle for the undercarriage and air brakes were given priority. 
  Various repetition durability and climate resistance tests 
were performed on the surface coils. In particular, the 
mechanical strength of the epoxy resin that is the mold material 
for the sidewall levitation coils was carefully checked. Also, 
research and development was diligently performed on the coil 
installation method and on maintaining installation precision. 
In addition to the major effect these factors have on the 
difficulty or ease of construction, they are important from the 
perspective of the feel of the ride. 
  A large-capacity 10 MVA class GTO inverter was built as the 
ground facility for the Miyazaki test track. We analyzed the 
major waveform characteristics in its output characteristics and 
high-frequency filter design. Based on these test results, we 
are starting to construct a practical GTO inverter for the 
Yamanashi test track. 
  As for developments related to branching equipment, 
development continues on branching equipment for high speeds and 
development is under way on branching equipment for the terminal 
and car bases. 
  In addition, the development is beginning on the control 
system, that includes the train drive control, operation 
control, and driving maintenance system, and the information 
transmission system. 
<H5>  Noise </H5>
  Maglev railways do not have the unavoidable wheel rotation 
noise and electricity collection noise of the pantograph found 
in wheel and rail systems, the only source of noise is the noise 
of air flowing around the cars. This is a superior feature. 
However, since air flow noise is proportional to the sixth to 
eighth power of the speed, it becomes large. Thus, not only 
conventional noise measures centered on soundproof walls, but 
measures to specifically control noise from the cars are 
required. By implementing noise reduction measures like reducing 
the cross-sectional area of the cars, removing projections from 
the cars, smoothing the surfaces of the cars, optimizing the 
front shape of the cars, and smoothing the surfaces of the 
surface coils, we can expect a 10 dB decrease in noise. In 
particular, aerodynamic optimization of the shape of the front 
section is essential to noise reduction. The front section's 
shape is not only important in terms of noise, but from the 
perspective of reducing drag. Hence, large-scale wind tunnel 
tests are being performed often. 
  The Shinkansen noise standard in Japan evaluates the peak 
value of the train during transit. In contrast, the noise 
standards in Europe and the United States use the equivalent 
noise level that includes the continuous noise period and the 
number of trains. Similar to airplanes, cars in maglev railway 
travel are not in contact with anything when traveling in the 
high-speed region, therefore, the quality of the noise differs 
from that of railroads. In addition, continuous periods of noise 
are extremely short since running is at ultra high speeds. 
Because the WECPNL (Weight Equivalent Continuously Perceptible 
Noise Level), which is the airplane noise standard (Environment 
Agency notice), is tentatively used in the Yamanashi test track 
as the noise evaluation method that is able to account for the 
running frequency of the cars, the continuous time, and the time 
range, 75WECPNL (Airplane Standard Type II compatible) is 
adopted. 
<H5>  Energy </H5>
  Experts have pointed out that the reason for the large power 
consumption in the running tests at the Miyazaki test track is a 
maglev railway is a transportation method with poor energy 
efficiency. In order to perform high-speed tests on a short 7 km 
test track, Miyazaki test track that requires a maximum 0.3 g 
acceleration and deceleration is considered unusual. 
  If the railways become faster, energy consumption will 
increase in response to the running resistance. Because 
aerodynamic drag is proportional to the square of the speed, 
most of the running resistance in the high-speed range is 
occupied by aerodynamic drag. As we move towards faster speeds 
in the future, how to decrease the running resistance, that is, 
aerodynamic drag, becomes a problem. Therefore, using the front 
shape with the least aerodynamic drag and reducing the 
cross-sectional areas of the cars are required. But this comes 
with the drawbacks of less comfort for the passengers in cars 
with small cross-sectional areas and fewer seats. 
  In trying to address the desire for faster speeds, the 
advantage of faster speeds to improve express service is 
overcome by the disadvantages of increased energy consumption 
caused by the faster speeds and decreased living space. As a 
consequence, social consensus and marketing decisions by 
businessmen are probably needed. 
  Since the ground facilities for a maglev railway use many 
drivers and controllers in the primary ground method, the cars 
can be much slimmer than conventional cars. Consequently, the 
percentage of a car weight occupied by passenger weight, namely, 
the payload ratio, increases (occupied car state: 20.0 tons, 
empty car state: 15.5 tons in a middle car). Because the system 
was constructed based on the idea that what does not have to be 
moved is not moved, it has the benefit of energy efficiency. 
  When energy efficiency in the energy (kcal) per person's 
weight in kilograms are compared without regard to speed, a 
domestic airport has a value of 579; an automobile, 527; the 
Tokaido Shinkansen, 105, while JR Maglev's value is only 315. 
<H5>  Magnetism </H5>
  There is the impression that a maglev railway generates 
strong magnetic fields that harm the human body. In fact, the 
effect of the magnetic fields generated by the superconducting 
magnets on the passengers and on people who live along the track 
is at the same level as the magnetic fields they normally live 
in. Many electrical appliances like electric razors, hair 
dryers, televisions, and washing machines that everyone uses 
have magnetic fields. The magnetic fields of medical treatment 
pads (1,300 gauss) for stiff shoulders or magnetic necklaces are 
also close to the body. Furthermore, the whole body is exposed 
to a maximum of 20,000 gauss (stationary magnetic field) in 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment that is rapidly 
spreading in the medical field to image tomograms. Of course, 
artificial precision devices such as heart pacemakers in the 
body and video cameras are sensitive to magnetic fields. 
  No safety standards concerning magnetic fields have been 
established in Japan. While there is no proof that magnetic 
fields are harmful to health, example standard values for 
fluctuating magnetic fields established nationally in foreign 
countries are 50 gauss or less at 50 Hz in the German Industrial 
Standard and 20 gauss or less at 100 Hz established by the 
British Radiation Protection Committee. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The development of the maglev railway is entering the stage 
where efforts will center on improving reliability and reducing 
costs in the move towards practical use. By considering 
development and evaluation methods in other fields like 
automobiles and airplanes and actively incorporating the 
development technology from each field, development is 
proceeding at a rapid pace. A variety of tests are planned for 
the Yamanashi test track as a compilation of these technology 
developments. The results may lead to a deeper understanding of 
most of the technical issues and the final evaluation of the 
maglev railway may become possible.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  In June 1990, the Basic Technology Development Project and 
the Yamanashi Test Track Construction Project received approval 
from the Minister of Transportation; this launched the Yamanashi 
Test Track as a national project. 
  Today, the Railway Technical Research Institute in 
partnership with Tokai Passenger Railway Co. (JR Tokai) and the 
Japan Railway Construction Corporation are gaining the 
cooperation of Yamanashi Prefecture and are proceeding with 
full-scale construction. 
<H5>  Construction Status </H5>
  The three business partners and Yamanashi Prefecture 
sponsored a series of local informational meetings in a total of 
18 districts in the six cities and towns (Sakagawa-mura, 
Yatsushiro-cho, Misaka-cho, Ootsuki-shi, Tsuru-shi, 
Akiyama-mura) situated along the Yamanashi test track. 
Explanations on the environment, safety, and compensation for 
the land required were repeated over 300 times. These efforts 
were linked to results, advanced the securing of approval for 
site entry in all the districts by the end of September 1992, 
and made possible construction of the 42.8 km test track. 
  Today, site negotiations are under way in the districts 
where 
surveying has been completed. With local understanding and 
cooperation, we closed contracts for site acquisition in the 
zone from Misakayama to Tsuru-shi and Ootsuki-shi on the eastern 
side. In addition, we are commissioning construction in the 
tunnel zone in the nine sites that cross both cities. With the 
exception of one site, excavation work is beginning. In cleared 
zones as well, construction preparations are continuing for 
facilities like car bases. 
  This civil engineering work is being performed under the 
auspices of JR Tokai and the Railway Corporation.

<H5>  Tests To Be Performed at the Yamanashi Test Track </H5>
  In order to reach the goal of the realization of a practical 
maglev railway at the Yamanashi test track, the following items 
will be verified through testing. 
  (1) Verification of safety and comfort at a steady, fast 
speed of 500 km/h 
  (2) Verification of reliability and durability of the 
superconducting magnets, the cars, the ground facilities, and 
the equipment 
  (3) Verification of structural standards like the minimum 
track radius (R = 8000 m) and the steepest grade (40&percnt;) 
  (4) Verification of required spacing (5.8 m) between the 
track centers for passing 
  (5) Verification of car's performance with respect to the 
tunnel's cross-sectional area and changes in pressure inside the 
tunnel 
  (6) Verification of performance of the branching equipment 
  (7) Verification of environmental soundness 
  (8) Establishment of a control system for multiple trains 
  (9) Verification of the operating maintenance system and the 
maintenance standards 
  (10) Verification of the control system between transformer 
substations 
  (11) Pursuing economy and understanding construction and 
business costs 
<H5>  Test Track Facilities </H5>
  Base facilities have been provided, for example, the command 
center that plays a central role during the running tests, the 
power transformer substations that supply power at variable 
voltages and variable frequencies in the surface propulsion 
coils, the car lot for storing low noise two-car trains that are 
low noise trains with little running resistance, and test 
platforms. 
  On lines with multiple tracks in the same direction, the GTO 
inverter that is used as the power transformer has 38 MVA per 
system (3 units set up for triple power). The propulsion coils 
running along the guideway carry a voltage of 22 kV. During the 
initial planning period, the GTO inverter was a 20 MVA class 
inverter and the voltage of the propulsion coils was 11 kV. But 
as plans to develop larger capacity and higher voltages 
proceeded, equipment closer to commercial standards was set up 
and used in the running tests. 
  The progress of test track construction was described 
earlier 
and the initial plan is about one year behind schedule. As a 
result, based on the initial objective of beginning tests when 
construction ends, the 18.4 km zone from Sasaki in Ootuki-shi 
(Koufu side) to Asahisoshi in Tsuru-shi (Tokyo side) is given 
precedence as a priority construction zone. This zone is 
included in the base facility described earlier. 
  Running tests will begin at the end of 1994, a year later 
than scheduled in the initial plan. But the advantage is fast 
acceleration traveling that is designed in the improved 
standards for the facilities explained earlier can be 
established. Except for the final verification of stability and 
durability when the train is running, the essential goal of 
implementation in mid-1997 stands. Outside the priority 
construction zone, consultations on the land required are being 
actively pursued. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Tunnel excavation work and equipment design and manufacture 
have been in progress since 1991. The project team composed of 
the Railway Technical Research Institute, JR Tokai, and the 
Railway Corporation plans to proceed with construction on the 
Yamanashi test track and further technical development. 
Therefore, basic systems, facility specifications, and test 
plans will be advanced substantially. 
  Although the acquisition of required land was delayed by one 
year, to avoid hindering the Basic Technology Development 
Project and the Yamanashi Test Track Construction Project, I 
would like to focus our best efforts and move forward in 
realizing the plan.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The MLU002 test vehicle for the Miyazaki test track was 
destroyed in a fire on 3 October 1991. 
  Although later running tests proceeded based on the 
conditions defined for the MLU001 manufactured in 1980, in order 
to develop vehicles for use on the Yamanashi test track, new 
test vehicles were needed to perform various tests and 
verification. Therefore, construction began on a new MLU002N 
test vehicle. This vehicle was completed at the end of last year 
and has been available for running tests since the end of 
January. 
<H5>  Basic Specifications of the MLU002N </H5>
  The following two proposals were considered as the design 
objective for the new test vehicle. 
  (1) With the premise of restoring the burned MLU002 to its 
original state, the only major revisions in the specifications 
are measures for fire. 
  (2) The design is completely redone. When possible, 
pre-checking of the vehicle for the Yamanashi test track is 
included in the specification revision. 
  Although proposal (2) was desired, the design and 
manufacturing periods were extremely short and an early start of 
full-scale testing at the Miyazaki test track was important. As 
a result, we proceeded with the design based on proposal (1) 
where restoration to the original state was critical. 
  From the manufacturing period in 1987 to the time of the 
fire, improvements lead to significant changes in the structure 
of the car and the superconducting magnets. The table compares 
the specifications of MLU002N's main features.

<H5>  Fastest Target Speed </H5>
  As with the MLU002, the fastest target speed in the design 
goal was the 420 km/h. 
  To achieve this speed on the 7 km long Miyazaki test track 
requires a highly reliable drive system of power supply 
equipment, surface coils, and superconducting magnets. Even the 
car fulfills the necessary conditions of a reliable independent 
braking system in the car and a lighter weight. 
  The weight of the car was increased by the fire measures to 
a 
final weight of 20 tons. It was clearly shown that removing some 
of the equipment and parts during the high-speed running test 
lessened the weight. Air brakes, that are not affected by the 
quench of the superconducting magnets or problems in the power 
supply system, were formally adopted as the independent brakes 
used on the car for emergency operation. (By having the brake 
discs project from the car body, air drag is increased to obtain 
braking power.) However, when simpler and lighter constructions 
are considered, the design was limited to the direction used. 
  As a result, even in the extreme condition of no 
regenerative 
braking, quench from half of the superconducting magnets, and 
one non-working air brake, the run curve for the high-speed runs 
on the test track is provided with a coil short-circuit 
generated braking interval at the terminal stop. Calculations 
showed that stopping from 420 km/h will be possible. 
<H5>  The Chassis and the Car </H5>
  Based on the investigation into the cause of the car fire on 
the MLU002, a variety of measures were implemented for fire 
resistance and noncombustibility. 
  The current cross-sectional shape of the chassis and the 
front shape are identical to those of the MLU002. However, the 
front of the structure was changed to an aluminum alloy made 
from carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and the front window 
was eliminated. 
  The materials used inside the car were noncombustible or 
fire 
resistant. Passenger facilities like interior furnishings, 
lighting, and air conditioning were the minimum required for the 
tests. The car's interior was partitioned into three sections. 
Only the central section, which is the instrument room, is 
surrounded by magnetic shielding plates. Seating space for 12 
people is maintained, but tests are being performed without any 
seats installed. 
  The car has different structures for the Miyazaki A Car and 
the Hyuga B Car. Car B has the same basic design of the car at 
the time of the fire and uses a linking superconducting magnetic 
elastic suspension method. Car A uses the newly designed 
superconducting magnetic elastic suspension method for the 
two-car frame. Since both cars operate under the conditions of 
opposing levitation sections mixed with sidewall levitation 
sections in the Miyazaki test track, restrictions are placed on 
the car and the construction and elastic suspension cannot 
normally be used. Consequently, the elastic suspension mechanism 
for the superconducting magnet is usually suppressed and tests 
are performed in a constant state. Elastic suspension is only 
activated to test the elastic suspension method. 
  The extension amount of the support leg and accompanying car 
height were corrected to the standard design values in the 
conventional opposing levitation method. 
  The superconducting magnets that have the same 
specifications 
as those in the revised MLU002 model were designed to have low 
current densities. The air-conditioning system installed in Car 
A uses the Claude process and that in Car B uses the Sterling 
process. Since the battery has capacity to operate only one car 
from the power source in the car operating the car's air 
conditioner. A lighter weight is designed by operating only one 
side during the running tests. 
  The above diagram [not included] shows the exterior of the 
car. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Immediately before Japan National Railways was broken up and 
privatized, the MLU002, that had been nurtured under the 
guidance of the Railway Technical Research Institute, was weak 
by nature. Nevertheless, we persevered. As a result, 
expectations are increasing, but difficult problems concerning 
the real ability are troublesome. At last, we are quickly 
approaching the final phase. 
  Given the priceless instruction received from the MLU002, 
the 
initial design that was the responsibility of the Railway 
Technical Research Institute, and the intense scrutiny, the 
MLU002N was born. Although I believe a variety of problems will 
be encountered in the future, I would like to see them dealt 
with seriously.

  [Text] Matsushita Electric Industries (Hiroichi Morishita, 
president) announced on the 13th that it was the first in the 
industrial world to succeed in making a practical red 
semiconductor laser for optical disk equipment. Compared to the 
near infrared type (wavelength 780 nm) that is currently in use, 
this laser will be able to record 30&percnt; more data on an 
optical 
disk. Two kinds of samples of this device will be shipped from 
January 1994: a joint record and playback device and a playback 
only device. The price of the joint record and playback sample 
(optical output 35 mW) will be &yen;70,000, and the price of the 
playback only sample (optical output 5 mW) will be &yen;10,000. 
  Optical disks use a semiconductor laser to record and play 
back, but semiconductor lasers which output infrared light 
(wavelength 680 nm) have not been commercially available thus 
far. The light which is reflected off the optical disk and 
returned produces noise, and it has been difficult to reduce 
this noise enough to make a practical device. 
  The interference of light, which has been the source of the 
noise for joint record and playback devices, is controlled by 
making the fluxes of reflected light into multiple beams 
(multi-mode) by allowing high frequency current (500 MHz before 
and after) to flow in the laser light. Meanwhile, a multi-mode 
was realized for the playback only device by using the technique 
of an activated layer by which light is actually put out 
(self-excitation oscillation). It is a small package size with a 
diameter of 5.6mm.

  [Text] Toshiba has developed a high powered krypton 
fluoride excimer laser device that will be indispensable in the 
mass production of the next generation of semiconductors. 
Reportedly, it can be used as the light source for projection 
equipment, and in the stepper (successive movement type 
reduction projection equipment) by which 64 Mbit semiconductors 
and beyond will be mass produced. So far, Toshiba has been 
successful in heightening the output up to a maximum of 8 watts, 
and has raised the exposure efficiency, which has been a weak 
point with excimer lasers, by increasing the number of pulses 
that can be irradiated per second by about 50&percnt;. 
  Currently, ultraviolet light is used for the light source of 
steppers which mass produce 16 Mbit DRAMS. However, because 
ultra fine circuit patterns are required when entering the next 
generation of semiconductors, progress is being made in the 
development of light sources using excimer lasers and X-rays 
which put out ultraviolet light with even shorter wavelengths. 
  Because excimer lasers put out ultraviolet light, already 
existing production processes can be used, and the equipment can 
be made compact. These lasers are hopeful candidates for the 
next generation light sources, but they have been found to have 
problems in terms of mass production because of the output of 
the laser, the frequency that is irradiated, and the 
deterioration of equipment. 
  Toshiba's new equipment incorporates a resonator which 
combines a mirror and an element that narrows the wavelength by 
making a narrow band region, and thus the output of the laser 
has been heightened to about twice that of conventional units 
while preserving the quality. Additionally, the exposure time 
can be shortened by being able to irradiate at a maximum 
frequency of 600 times per second. Moreover, a means using a 
prism was adopted to put only one part of the laser output in 
the resonator, and this delays the deterioration of the element 
within the resonator. 
  As a result, the longevity of the element that makes the 
narrow band region can be extended 10 times or more, the 
frequency and cost of replacement are reduced, and the 
operational efficiency of the stepper can be improved. The 
device has a compact size with a width of 150 cm, a height 160 
cm, and a depth of 50 cm. 
  The device developed is effective as a light source for 
steppers with a design specification of from 0.35 &mgr;m to 0.15 
&mgr;m for use in 1 Gbit DRAMs.

  [Text] Matsushita Electric Industries has developed a low 
noise, red semiconductor laser which will be a light source for 
the next generation of optical disk devices. The noise has been 
reduced to one-tenth compared to conventional devices, and this 
can meet the standards for image signal and data memory 
equipment for Hi-Vision video. Also, the circuit configuration 
may be simplified because it is a positive power source drive. 
Samples of a joint record and playback device (light output 35 
mW) and a playback only device (light output 5 mW) in a compact 
package with a diameter of 5.6mm will begin shipment in January 
of next year. Red light sources have a shorter wavelength 
compared to the current near infrared light sources, and the 
recording density is 1.3 times higher. 
  This same red semiconductor laser emits a laser light with a 
wavelength of 680 nm. The device has been made multibeam which 
has little noise generated from interference with reflected 
light compared to single beam oscillation, and the signal to 
noise ratio has been dropped to approximately one-tenth (a 
relative noise strength of -120 dB). By doing this, a high 
product quality laser light was obtained which records and plays 
back image signals and data. The operational temperature range 
is between -10 and +50&deg; C. Samples of the joint record and 
playback device (operational current 90 mA, threshold value 
current 45 mW, sample price &yen;70,000), and the playback only 
device (35 mA, 25 mW, &yen;10,000) will be shipped from January 
of next year. 
  Also, the drive power source was made into the same positive 
drive voltage environment as the +2.5V of the surrounding 
circuits. In addition, heightening the thermal release 
efficiency also contributes to making a simpler, more compact 
and thinner configuration of the light pick up parts, allowing 
assembly into a package with a diameter of 5.6mm 
(conventionally, a 9mm diameter). 
  Red light reduces the spot diameter 30&percnt; compared to 
the near 
infrared laser that is the light source of current optical disk 
devices (wavelength 780 nm). For this reason, the recording 
point can be made smaller, and the recording density per unit 
surface area can be enlarged.

  [Text] The heavy particle beam cancer therapy device 
(HIMAC) which was built by the National Institute of 
Radiological Sciences (NIRS, Mr. Hirotoshi MATSUDAIRA, director) 
of the STA has been completed and will be opened to related 
researchers on the 13th. This equipment is a facility equipped 
with the world's first medical dedicated use accelerator that 
will irradiate cancer-afflicted areas by accelerating helium and 
argon ions. Construction has been completed with a total 
contribution of investments of &yen;32.6 billion since FY87. In 
the future adjustments will be made to the beam line, and this 
highly advanced device will go on line from March 1994, when 
clinical therapy will begin. 
  Cancer therapies include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy, and while these aim at extermination of the cancer, 
they are still not decisive. This new device represents the most 
advanced technology for radiation therapy, and it can treat 
cancer while sparing normal cells by narrowing the target to the 
cancer-afflicted portion only. Currently, the Heavy Particle 
Beam Therapy Network Conference, of which NIRS is a participant, 
is making progress in planning for the treatment of cancers 
afflicting specific areas, and treatment of the brain will begin 
in March. Next, manuals for the treatment of the lungs and the 
central nervous system will be made, and actual treatments for 
all three areas will begin in FY94. In 1998, it is hoped that 
there can be treatment for cancer afflicting 10 different areas. 
  For this purpose, the STA has plans to construct a custom 
hospital which will be an approximately 100-bed facility that 
has five stories above ground and one below ground. The STA 
expects to invest &yen;12.9 billion in this, and begin 
construction in FY94. Also, a Heavy Particle Beam International 
Clinic Joint Use Center that aims at international joint 
research will be completed by FY96 with the intention of 
providing an international base for heavy particle beam therapy. 
  Design funds for the Center will be appropriated in FY94, 
and 
construction will begin in 1995. The plans are to encompass 150 
researchers at all times by providing a conference room, joint 
research labs and individual research labs. Along with this, in 
FY94 the NIRS will begin heavy particle project research which 
will heighten the therapeutic results of this equipment. Studies 
are being conducted to initiate four research groups: a three 
dimensional CT development and heavy particle beam therapy 
research group; a diagnostic research group; a research group to 
physiologically investigate the mechanisms for the treatment of 
cancer; and a physics and engineering research group to 
physically investigate these mechanisms.

  [Text] On September 7, the Kansai Science City Promotion 
Organization published two reports entitled "The Academia Plan 
for the Keihan Metropolitan Region," concerning future plans for 
research activities in the Science City, and "The New Logical 
City Image for Keihan," which describes a unified image for 
municipal road development. The city's planning methods were 
reviewed for the first time in 15 years since the 1978 release 
of the Science City Construction Plan. These reports were 
distributed to each concerned agency as a basis for future 
discussions on the city's development. 
  The reports were compiled by the Science Council of the 
organization, which was chaired by Juichi Oyabu, Professor 
Emeritus at Osaka City University, and investigated by a working 
committee established in April 1991. The "Academia Plan" 
provided a research system for science and technology in Kansai 
Science City. In addition, it advanced (1) research on the 
foundations of human existence in philosophy and the arts; (2) 
research on guaranteeing the conditions for the survival of the 
human race, for instance on disputes, food, and energy; and (3) 
research on future images of life, cities, and industry which 
consider the coexistence of technology and the natural 
environment as directions for the long overdue establishment of 
research laboratories related to culture and society and future 
themes the city must tackle. 
  In the "New Logical City Image," the 12 districts that form 
Kansai Science City and the roads which connect them will be 
interconnected in a logical system of ancient cities like 
Heijokyo where the roads were laid out like the squares on a 
checkerboard. The haphazard progress of building in each 
district is unified under this "new logic." The objective is for 
the Science City to give one impression. 
  These two reports written by the organization were 
distributed to Kyoto Fu, Osaka Fu, Nara Prefecture, the National 
Land Agency, ministries, agencies, municipalities, and the 
financial organizations like the Kansai Economic Federation as a 
basis for devising the grand plan for future support of Kansai 
Science City.

  [Text] The provision of equipment in the research 
environment for basic technology research is a pressing need. 
Expanding the use of national research facilities can benefit 
corporations. 
  The world is looking for international contributions such as 
original research from Japan. Cooperation between the industrial 
world, academia, and national laboratories is one element that 
is lacking. A survey conducted by the Science and Technology 
Agency pointed out the lack of progress in shared use of 
advanced research equipment and facilities owned by government 
laboratories. The needs of industry and academia which would 
like more use of the advanced facilities at national 
laboratories have increased. If plans are devised to maintain 
the research environment to address this need, major 
contributions would be made to the development of leading-edge 
basic technologies along with the acceleration of basic 
research. Revised plans based on these survey results must be 
quickly reflected in policy. 
  Many of the latest facilities and human resources are needed 
to advance the frontiers of basic technological development and 
basic research required in the rapid development of society. 
However, the facilities are expensive and too risky economically 
and in terms of research for corporations to individually 
acquire this equipment. If shared use is advanced in government 
laboratories, in addition to preventing duplicate investments of 
research funds, we could expect more activity in research 
exchanges with the government laboratories, in effect, killing 
two birds with one stone. However, the connection has only been 
opened between university and government lab as in Tsukuba City 
in Ibaraki prefecture. 
  According to the survey, the need for various types of high 
performance analysis equipment and special test facilities has 
increased. This is because they can be used as tools in a wide 
range of research from basic to applied. Corporations, in 
particular, wish to use non-destructive test equipment, wind 
tunnels, earthquake-proof test equipment, while universities 
would like to use radiation test equipment and accelerators. 
  According to a survey conducted around the beginning of July 
by Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun Ltd. of leading corporations (189 
responses received), the total amount of investment in research 
and development for fiscal year 1993 was &yen;6.3 trillion, a 
&yen;3.1 billion increase over the previous year. Although the 
investment in equipment has decreased significantly due to the 
depressed economy, maintenance of R&amp;D funds at a high level 
was 
reported. R&amp;D funds, however, are only squeezed out of sales, 
thus affect research and development for discovering the seeds 
for future businesses given the protracted stagnation, and are 
not connected to the provision of an uninterrupted research 
environment. Neglecting the provision of research environment 
misses the chance of launching new businesses or frustrates the 
establishment of basic technology. 
  The objective is the shared use of government laboratory 
facilities. The obstacles to joint research uncovered by the 
Science and Technology Agency survey were access difficulty by 
corporations, such as "difficulty in finding research partners" 
and "not obtaining information on research themes," as well as 
problems associated with handling the results, such as reverting 
patents. Although solutions and obstacles were summarized, their 
reflection in specific policies is the first manifestation of 
the report's significance. Cooperation between industry, 
academia, and government has already been established in the 
Research Exchange Act and must be promoted in the current 
stagnant economy. The fiscal year 1994 opening of the 
large-scale radiation facility in Hyogo prefecture currently 
under construction by the Science and Technology Agency is a 
facility planned in the Act and the provision of research 
environment for industry, academia, and government has been 
decided.

<F P=106> [Article by Tsuyoshi Nakai, Head of International Research </F>
Exchange Division, AIST, MITI] 
  [Text] In order to stimulate joint international research 
between Japanese corporations and foreign public research 
organizations, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) has adopted a policy to establish a new support system 
for 1994. The content of the support system is described by Mr. 
Tsuyoshi Nakai, head of the International Research Exchange 
Division, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
  What is the specific content of the new support system? 
  "Preferential treatment will be applied in the taxation 
system for required R&amp;D expenses when private Japanese 
companies 
undertake joint research with foreign government research 
organizations. Specifically, a 6&percnt; tax deduction of R&amp;D 
expenses, including personnel costs, is being considered. The 
implementation of revisions to the tax system is targeted for 
1994." 
  Does it matter which research organization in whatever 
country is the partner for joint research? 
  "We are not planning to impose limitations to specific 
countries. Associations with government research organizations 
of the United States or research laboratories of the European 
Community (EC) are both acceptable. Even foreign financed 
enterprises which have research laboratories in Japan are 
targets for preferential treatment." 
  Why has this kind of support system been deemed necessary? 
  "Regardless of whether a country is developed or developing, 
there is a high degree of interest overseas in the technological 
development strength of Japanese corporations. The desire 
throughout the world is to improve their country's technological 
strength by performing joint research in industrial technology 
fields where Japanese corporations are strong. 
  "On the other hand, actions like restrictions by Japanese 
corporations on the expansion of R&amp;D expenses in the recent 
depressed economy are occurring. Its influence on joint research 
with foreign organizations has begun to appear. While responding 
to the wishes of the world, in order to advance the 
technological strength of Japanese corporations through joint 
development, a new support policy was deemed necessary." 
  Japan has been criticized by other countries for hitching a 
free ride on the results of basic research. 
  "This support policy will be promoted while giving 
sufficient 
thought so as not to invite this kind of misunderstanding. For 
example, when government research laboratories in the United 
States and Japanese corporations embark on joint research, we 
would like to finalize decisions after appropriate supporting 
measures have been adjusted and decided in cooperation with the 
United States government. 
  "Cooperation in industrial technology fields is a principal 
item in the Comprehensive U.S.-Japan Economic Conference. 
Concrete joint research themes will be future topics of 
discussion. The new support system will prepare for the 
participation of Japanese corporations in this kind of research 
planning."

  [Text] Each ministry and agency has submitted estimated 
budget requests for fiscal year 1994. Within the austere fiscal 
climate, since the early doubling of the government's research 
and development budget in the outline of science and technology 
policy set forth last year, the importance placed on the science 
and technology budget related to basic research and lifestyle is 
a distinguishing feature. The particulars of the requests from 
each ministry or agency are summarized. 
  Science and Technology Agency The requested amount 
for the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and 
Technology is &yen;16.3 billion, a 22.6&percnt; increase over 
this 
fiscal year's original budget. A substantial increase is eyed 
for two consecutive years. 
  Science and technology useful in improving the quality of 
the 
lives of the citizenry are stressed. The construction of heavy 
particle beam cancer treatment facilities at comprehensive 
medical research radiation laboratories, disaster prevention, 
and safety measures like earthquake prediction were given 
priority. 
  A total of &yen;1.1 billion is requested for the 
establishment of the Ministry Network Promotion Program to 
disseminate research information by linking the national 
laboratories of each ministry and agency via high-speed 
circuits. In addition, &yen;12.7 billion, an additional &yen;3.7 
billion more than this fiscal year, is requested for the 
construction of a large-scale radiation facility. 
  As for space &yen;4.99 billion is requested for a target 
test 
flight around 1999 of an unmanned winged shuttle on which 
research and development have begun. 
  Ministry of International Trade and Industry The 
total amount requested in the budget outline related to 
technological development increased 7.5&percnt; over last year to 
&yen;301,707 million. 
  The amount requested for the New Sunshine Project which is 
approaching the second year of revamping the research and 
development system is &yen;561,768 million, an 8.6&percnt; 
increase. 
Although not new programs, existing projects, such as the wide 
area energy use network and the international clean energy 
system technology which use hydrogen, are being completed. 
  In industrial science and technological research and 
development (&yen;25,853 million, a 6.2&percnt; increase), the 
synergy 
ceramics (high-order structure control fused inorganic 
materials) project is being promoted as pioneering research. In 
addition, five themes including next generation metal 
manufacturing technology have been newly added. 
  Of the other projects, the fourth generation computer 
development (&yen;5,718 million, a 57&percnt; increase) and the 
joint 
international IMS (Intelligent Manufacturing System) program 
(&yen;1,614 million, a 48&percnt; increase) stand out. 
  Ministry of Education A science research expense 
assistance fund of &yen;83.9 billion, a substantial 14.0&percnt; 
increase, is requested. Also, the facilities expense for the 
aging national universities is 14.8&percnt; more than this 
fiscal year 
at &yen;125,019 million. In addition, a new request was made for 
funds to hasten renovation at national universities. 
  The total amount requested by the Ministry of Education was 
&yen;5,613,719 million, a 3.5&percnt; increase. This indicates 
the 
desire to improve the research environment at national 
universities and exceed the previous administration's support of 
research. 
  The total amount requested for promoting costs for basic 
research in specific fields, much of which is targeted to 
research costs of big science like space science, accelerators, 
and nuclear fusion, is &yen;62.58 billion, a 2.9&percnt; 
increase. 
  Ministry of Health and Welfare The request of 
&yen;3.2 billion in the first fiscal year budget for what is 
tentatively called the 10-Year Project To Conquer Cancer is the 
star. This is the successor to the 10-Year Comprehensive 
Strategy Against Cancer that ends this fiscal year. Previously, 
the emphasis was on basic research on explaining cancer. In the 
future, clinical research connected to practical treatments and 
prevention will be advanced. The Comprehensive Cancer Treatment 
Support System will be provided so medical treatment facilities 
nationwide can use the pioneering medical treatment information 
of the National Cancer Center. 
  The amount requested for health science research expenses is 
&yen;11.4 billion (a 20.9&percnt; increase). The overall rate of 
increase was a sizable 5.5&percnt;. The costs of preventive 
research 
on the side effects caused by combining many drugs as well as 
research on medical treatment problems such as the recent 
outbreak of hospital infections and side effects to preventive 
vaccinations have been added as new expenses. 
  In addition to having few patients, the hesitation by 
corporations to perform research, the increased research subsidy 
costs of medicines for rare illnesses, and the cost of 
sponsoring the international AIDS conference to be held next 
August in Japan are included. 
  Environment Agency In the request outlined for 
fiscal year 1994, the amount requested for the science and 
technology promotion fund budgeted for research and development 
is &yen;13,647 million, a 8.5&percnt; increase compared to the 
fiscal 
year 1993 budget. Of this amount, &yen;2,500 million are the 
promotion costs of comprehensive earth environment research. 
This is a 19&percnt; increase, &yen;400 million more than the 
current 
fiscal year. 
  The promotion cost is a budget for survey research targeted 
at preserving the earth's environment. Support is provided for 
joint projects advanced through the cooperation of experts from 
a wide range of research organizations which include not only 
the Environment Agency, but national universities and national 
research organizations under the umbrella of ministries and 
agencies, such as the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, 
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Ministry of 
Construction. 
  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries&gt; med&gt; 
With the objective of basic and pioneering research, domestic 
animal genome analysis where the genes of domestic animals like 
cows and pigs are analyzed is a seven year project to begin next 
year. &yen;130 million is requested for the coming fiscal year. 
The DNA Bank which systematically accumulates and presents data 
obtained from rice plant genome analysis research will begin 
operation. As for environmental problems, investigations on 
agriculture, forestry, and fishery industrial environment 
restoration technologies will begin.

  [Text] A regional technical activities forum on a system 
for exchanges between different businesses focusing on machinery 
manufacturers in Kansai began discussions on technology exchange 
and technical support for small and medium-sized businesses. 
(The discussion group was held at 3-6-32 Nakanoshima, Kita-ku, 
Osaka-shi. Kensaku Imaichi, Professor Emeritus at Osaka 
University and President of Osaka Hoki Seisakujo was the 
delegate. Tel: 06-443-4640.) In order to respond with concrete 
technical support, a subcommittee was established by industry, 
academia, and government, to exchange technical know-how such as 
patents held by member companies, between companies, the 
collection and publication of the seeds and needs were 
undertaken. The objective is to open the door to small and 
medium-sized businesses in joint ventures between industry and 
academia that overemphasize large companies and to support 
improvements in their technologies. 
<H5>  Exchanging Technical Know-How </H5>
  The joint industry-academia subcommittee established at the 
forum examines the best ways to solve the various technical 
problems presented by committee members and advises the 
requesting company about solutions. Yoshio Miyoshi, assistant 
professor of machinery and materials at Osaka University, was 
placed in charge of a committee discussion group consisting of 
five professors from universities in Kansai and experts in 
measurement control, image processing, and manufacturing 
processes. 
  Already the results of automatically measuring fish kept for 
food used by breeders have been presented. When a solution was 
found, payment for the success, such as research assistance 
funds, is paid to the professor in charge. 
  Furthermore, a publications and information subcommittee was 
newly established. It is to link the seeds information of 
companies that would like to spread technology by selling it to 
the needs information of companies interested in becoming active 
in those technologies. 
  Specifically, the seeds and needs, product introductions, 
and 
technical information of each company will be collected in an 
organizational publication and presented to committee members 
twice a year. Information related to seeds and needs is received 
regularly by the business office on printed forms. Information 
from companies other than committee members is handled in the 
same manner. Urgent information is presented to associated 
committee members in a timely fashion. 
  The forum began as a subordinate organization of the Kansai 
chapter of The Japanese Society of Mechanical Engineers. It is 
composed of the management organizations of leading companies, 
small and medium-sized businesses, and public research 
organizations, professors from the universities, about 80 
businesses, and individuals.

  [Text] On 26 August, the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI) announced the outline of the new tax system 
required by the 1994 tax system reforms. Five tax incentives 
including ones for information management, investments in Japan, 
and energy and two reserve fund systems were established. In 
addition, the current corporate restoration system for 
businesses in the red that was suspended will be revived. In the 
long-term depressed domestic economy, these tax incentives are 
established to stimulate the recovery of equipment investment. 
At the same time, recovery funds for businesses which continue 
to be in the red are earmarked as sources of revenue for 
restructuring. 
  The new tax systems established by MITI are the High-Level 
Information Management Tax Incentive, the Corporate Investment 
in Japan for Opening the Market Tax Incentive, the Senior 
Citizen and Disabled Persons Participation in Society Tax 
Incentive, the International Joint Research Tax Incentive, the 
Investment for Strengthening the Energy Supply and Demand Tax 
Incentive, the Reserve System for Investments in Establishing 
Small and Mid-Sized Enterprises, and the Thermal Exchange 
Reserve Fund System. 
  The content of the new tax system settled on so far includes 
a tax deduction of 7&percnt; for purchasing (including leasing) 
equipment or a 30&percnt; special refund system for improved 
information management. There is a tax deduction for users of 
system integration (SI) contracts. Investments to open the 
Japanese market are limited to 10 years following establishment. 
When sales in Japan exceed 2&percnt; of the highest previous 
total, 
the increase is limited to 5&percnt;. In addition, the amount of 
one 
half of the rate of increase multiplied by total increase is a 
tax deduction. 
  The Senior Citizen and Disabled Persons Participation in 
Society Tax Incentive sets up a 3&percnt; special refund system 
for 
the introduction of support equipment. A 6&percnt; tax deduction 
of 
research costs is provided in the International Joint Research 
Tax Incentive. 
  The Investment for Strengthening the Energy Supply and 
Demand 
Tax Incentive promotes advances in energy conservation, 
renewable energy, and thermal-electric cogeneration, as well as 
providing for the stable supply of oil and natural gas. A 
7&percnt; 
tax deduction of the total acquisition costs and a special 
refund of 30&percnt; for the first year have been approved. 
  In order to support the establishment of small and mid-sized 
businesses by investment, lending, and start-up companies, in 
the investment losses in establishing small and mid-sized 
enterprises based on the new reserve system, up to 20&percnt; of 
the 
capital invested annually will not be taxed and a reserve fund 
will be accumulated. Depreciation is applied when losses in 
investments occur during the establishment of a business. The 
remaining depreciation is introduced as profit after five years. 
  The Thermal Exchange Reserve Fund System is diredcted at gas 
companies in small and medium-sized cities (240 companies). The 
system allows the expenses required to convert to high-calorie 
gas to be accumulated over a five-year period as a reserve fund 
and for loss inclusion.

  [Text] In cooperation with the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Education, the Science 
and Technology Agency has decided to construct a high-speed 
communication network to connect the research divisions of 
government laboratories and corporations, tentatively called the 
Ministry Research Information Network. Verification research 
will be addressed in a three-year plan starting in 1994. About 
&yen;1 billion will be allocated from the Special Coordination 
Funds for Promoting Science and Technology for the first year. 
The information accumulated by each research organization will 
cross the fences between agencies and be freely used. The aim is 
to provide an infrastructure to foster academic and pioneering 
research activities and have it open to foreign research 
organizations. At the Comprehensive U.S.-Japan Economic 
Conference which begins next month, the American side is 
expected to raise the problems of scientific and technical 
information in Japan in the working group on technology access; 
the objective is to beat them to the punch. 
  The target of the Ministry Research Information Network is a 
Japanese version of the High-Performance Computing and 
Communications (HPCC) Program that is being promoted in the 
United States with the aim of strengthening international 
competitive strength in science and technology. In addition to 
being behind in providing local information bases, such as local 
area networks, Japanese research is far behind in communications 
speed in networks between research organizations. Therefore, 
from the perspective of information flow and shared use of 
computers, Japan is far behind the United States. Not only 
Japanese researchers, but foreign researchers have voiced 
dissatisfaction. 
  Under these circumstances, representatives from the Science 
and Technology Agency, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry, and the Industry of Posts 
and Telecommunications visited the United States in June of this 
year to look at the HPCC structure and the state of progress of 
one of its links, the information highway concept. Based on this 
result, studies progressed on the realization of a research 
information network centered at the Science and Technology 
Agency. 
  In this plan, not only the building of a computer network, 
but research on the software used like electronic mail, 
electronic conferencing, electronic bulletin boards, and for 
sharing computers will be closely examined. At the same time, 
database construction for researchers to load information onto 
the network is given technical support and is actively 
implemented. 
  In addition to these four organizations, the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, the Ministry of Health and 
Welfare, the Ministry of Construction have also expressed an 
interest in participating. The objective is to include all 
government laboratories and research divisions of corporations. 
  Currently, communication lines leased from 
telecommunications 
companies are being tested. In the future, research 
organizations will be connected by optical fiber cables. By only 
plugging computer connectors into the cable terminal, 
information from various domestic and foreign research 
organizations can be obtained or information can be exchanged. 
  According to the Science and Technology Agency, "In the 
United States, a communication network is being provided that 
will enable the full text of a speech by the President States to 
be extracted as a hard copy by a personal computer and read on 
the same day. Even in Japan, we would like to have personal 
computers extract important research announcements at academic 
conferences on the same day from the research information 
network.

  [Text] On 25 August, the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology (AIST) of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) completed the description of next year's 
position for the Industrial Science and Technology Research and 
Development Program in the Industrial Technology Council (an 
advisory organ appointed by the Minister of MITI). In pioneering 
research where preparatory research for projects and 
pre-evaluation are performed, five new research problems will be 
undertaken next year, beginning with precise polymeric 
materials. Of the five pioneering research currently underway, 
inorganic materials with high-order structure control will be 
elevated to a project next year. The budget for next year 
received as 6.2&percnt; increase over the budget for fiscal year 
1993 
for the whole system to &yen;25.9 billion. A 63.4&percnt; 
increase of 
about &yen;400 million is planned for pioneering research. 
  The Industrial Science and Technology Research and 
Development Program established this year is integrated into the 
older Large Scale R&amp;D Program. The pioneering research 
program 
is set up with the objective of determining which program should 
become a project. Pioneering research will last two to three 
years with an annual budget of &yen;4 or 5 billion for one theme. 
  Pioneering research programs which will begin next year are 
(1) Precise Polymeric Materials, (2) Accelerated Bio Functions 
Fabrication Technology (time machine bio), (3) Human Media and 
Expert Machine Technology (tentative name), (4) Next Generation 
Metal Resource Production Technology, and (5) Manufactured Goods 
Evaluation and High-Level Measurement Analysis Technology. 
  In the Precise Polymeric Materials research, polymer methods 
which precisely control the one-dimensional structure of 
polymers and techniques to accurately analyze the structure of 
polymer sequence will be investigated and developed. The 
essential performance and function of current polymers cannot be 
understood by perturbing the chemical structure. The intent of 
this research is to solve these shortcomings. A basic technology 
of polymer materials for the next generation is expected. 
  Accelerated Bio Function Fabrication Technology has the 
objectives of clarifying the mechanisms of the evolution of 
living things and building evolutionary test system with 
artificial mutations at the laboratory level. Based on this, it 
will be possible to create biological functions for the 
objectives of ultra heat resistance and ultra pressure 
resistance that are applicable to chemical material 
manufacturing processes. 
  In Next Generation Metal Resource Manufacturing Technology, 
metal recycling technology which places a light load on the 
environment and conserves energy by using light and bacteria 
will be developed. A precision manufacturing system which 
collects uniform resources and does not use smokestacks will be 
developed. The aim is to effectively use resources and to 
contribute solutions to the world's environmental problems.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) will expand and strengthen its high level industrial 
support plan for developing countries beginning with various 
countries in the Asian Pacific region. Specifically, (1) 
cooperating in the training of people for an industrial base and 
the creation of development projects, as well as nurturing 
budding industries; (2) establishing a low interest finance 
system to support small and medium-sized businesses that are 
venturing overseas and the provision of information; and (3) 
building a framework for planning international harmony of each 
system in the Asian Pacific region. A policy to suit each 
country is developed at MITI through policy discussions with the 
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
  To support the establishment of an economic development base 
in developing countries, in addition to providing an industrial 
infrastructure, budding industries which supply parts to 
assembly industries will be fostered. To accomplish this, 
cooperation in training and technical development is advanced 
together with extending the loss reserve funding system for 
overseas investments to eastern European and central Asian 
countries. Also, relaxation of the investment system and trade 
with developing countries is proposed. 
  As one link in restructuring small and medium-sized 
businesses in Japan, there will be support of capital to enable 
gradual progress in overseas investments. In addition to the 
Restructuring Support Loan System for direct overseas investment 
from government finance organs, advisory guidance for companies 
venturing overseas will also be implemented.

<F P=106> [Article by Nakao Ishida, Chairman of the Cosmos Planning </F>
Promotion Conference, Professor Emeritus of Tohoku University, 
Doctor in the Medical Department of Tohoku National University] 
  [Text] The Tohoku Intelligent Cosmos Plan which covers the 
seven prefectures in the Tohoku region including Niigata 
prefecture was proposed in 1987, has proceeded smoothly, and six 
years have already passed. Its intent is to make the Tohoku 
region a major base of science, technology, and information as 
well as a base to launch information overseas. 
  We see that 11 R&amp;D companies have been established in 
each 
region in Tohoku. Creative research organizations related to 
communications, new materials, and biotechnology appeared one by 
one. More than 50 patents have been applied for at the Low Power 
High-Speed Communication Laboratory since research activities 
began five years ago. 
<H5>  1. Funding </H5>
  Bases for basic and applied research can be established in 
Japan outside of universities. Investment capital consisted of 
the 70&percnt; which came from special industrial investment by 
the 
government and the remaining 30&percnt; of private capital. 
Companies 
with a particularly strong interest in the research items 
provided funds and researchers to give rise to a new form of 
research laboratory with money and people. It was proven that if 
prominent researchers or research advisors are present, research 
development is possible even outside university laboratories. 
<H5>  2. Research period </H5>
  One problem is the time limitation. Specifically, we would 
like to think in terms of six years. As a consequence, the 
research content is squeezed into an approach road until 
establishment. Moreover, specifying the method for research 
cooperation is crucial. Even when the objective is shared, 
regular preparation such as adjusting the methodology is 
required from the first year of the undertaking. 
<H5>  3. Regional expectations and central expectations </H5>
  The next obstacle posed is how are these results tied to 
advanced industrialization. Not only specially licensed 
corporations called base centers (Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry and Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications) 
which are in charge of investments, the biological research 
organization (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries), 
or the medical equipment fund (Ministry of Health and Welfare) 
have the "desire to clarify the output," each private 
corporation participating in R&amp;D imagines commercial 
development 
of the results. In addition, while thoroughly supporting the 
ideas and substance of the plan in the Tohoku Intelligent 
Cosmos Plan in the government's Tohoku Development Promotion 
Plan which received Cabinet approval on March 22, 1991. The 
expectation of obtaining results that fostered new industries 
was clearly stated. 
<H5>  4. Operation of future regional bases </H5>
  The seeds chosen for R&amp;D were not begun without 
sufficient 
alignment with the needs of the companies or the country. In 
addition, businesses generally do not have the boldness and 
implementation strength to position themselves for new product 
development and production. This is a dilemma of regional areas. 
As a result, with industry, government, and academia continuing 
to understand each others perspectives. The problems exposed by 
people in the objective awareness of the level of academia, the 
improvements in overall understanding by the government, and the 
prerequisite investment by industry are being eliminated through 
cooperation.

  [Text] The Institute of Intellectual Property (IIP, Ichiro 
Kato, chairman), an organization of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry's Patent Office, sensing the 
increasing severity of Japan-U.S. relations regarding 
intellectual property rights (IPR), has recently opened an 
office in Washington. The office will gather information on such 
issues as the movement in the U.S. Congress for patent law 
revision and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's 
(CAFC) Goal of uniform judicial precedents for IPR in the United 
States. IIP has appointed as its first office director Hirutsuna 
Yamashita, a chief researcher from the Patent Office presently 
on loan. 
  IIP in the past has invited such influential individuals as 
CAFC Chief Judge Helen Nies and former U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office (USPTO) Commissioner Harry Manbech obtained information 
on trends in U.S. patent suits and system revision. However, 
cases with Japanese corporations caught up in law suits at the 
court level have been increasing, and there is a growing need 
for detailed information. IIP also opened the local office 
because there has been a change in administration from the 
Republican Party to the Democratic Party, and it is important to 
develop new connections. 
  In the Clinton administration, the power of the hard-line 
faction on Japan has increased with the appointment of U.S. 
senate staffer Bruce Lehman as USPTO commissioner. Individuals 
involved in patents also see the intentions of the hard-line 
faction in the U.S. request in the Framework talks for the total 
prohibition of conputer program reverse engineering.

<F P=106> [Article written by Akihiko Nishiyama in New York] </F>
  [Text] The major U.S. chemical company 3M, Canada's 
electric power company Hydro-Quebec, and the U.S. Argonne 
National Laboratory have concluded a contract with the U.S. 
Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), an organization consisting 
of America's Big Three car makers and other companies, to 
develop a new battery for electric vehicles. USABC will invest a 
total of $33 million over the next two years in the thin-film 
lithium polymer battery. 
  Hydro-Quebec has concluded a contract with Yuasa Corporation 
for the joint development of a next-generation thin-film lithium 
battery. The potential has emerged of Yuasa joining indirectly 
in USABC's development project. 
  Under the contract, 3M will provide thin-film lithium 
polymer 
to Hydro-Quebec, which will then laminate the film and make the 
final product--the lithium battery. Argonne National Laboratory 
will handle performance testing of the prototype battery. 
  Lithium batteries have energy density nearly three times 
higher than the lead batteries presently used in electric 
vehicles, but there are safety problems. Safety is said to 
increase when the batteries are made thin-film ones. 
  In the United States, California, New York, and other states 
are requiring that 2 percent of all automobiles sold by each car 
company, beginning with the 1998 model year, be electric 
vehicles. Yuasa reached an agreement with Hydro-Quebec in 
January 1992 to develop jointly by 1998 a lithium polymer 
battery.

  [Text] Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (KHI, headed by 
President Hiroshi Ohba, President) has reached agreement with 
Allied Signal, a U.S. aircraft equipment manufacturer (located 
in California: Mr. David P. Burnham, Executive Vice President 
for Aerospace) on jointly developing an auxiliary power unit 
(APU) for aircraft. Announcement of this will be made shortly in 
Japan and the United States. The APU is designed for mid-sized 
passenger aircraft and Boeing is aiming to adopt it for use in 
new-type aircraft such as passenger planes it is developing. The 
first unit will be completed as early as 1996. Allied Signal is 
the leading firm in the APU business, holding around a 90 
percent share of the APU market. The belief is that by 
cooperating with KHI, Allied Signal will be able to sell the APU 
in the lucrative Japanese and Southeast Asian aircraft-company 
markets, markets that are expected to grow. 
  The APU's will be installed in the rear of passenger planes 
and used for such purposes as main-engine starting and powering 
cabin airconditioning. It can be expected that the APU will be 
mounted on new-type passenger planes that Boeing will develop 
based upon the mid-sized 737 passenger plane. 
  The prospect is for KHI to produce the APU by making active 
use of its Akaishi Plant, which is an aircraft engine factory 
(located in Akaishi, Hyogo Prefecture) and its Nishigami Plant 
(situated in Kobe). 
  In the past, KHI overhauled jet engines of companies such as 
Allison, GE, and Rolls Royce and manufactured helicopter engines 
by importing technology from Textron Lycoming of the United 
States. KHI participated in the joint development of the V2500 
engine for 150 seat-class passenger planes beginning in 1983. 
Furthermore, KHI had a 1.04 percent share in the development and 
manufacture of the U.S. Pratt and Whitney PW4000 in 1985 as well 
as a 2.9 percent share in the Rolls Royce RB211-524 in 1988 and 
decided on participation in the development and manufacture of 
the Trent 800, the development model of that engine in 1990.

  [Text] Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) formally announced 
on 22 September 1993 that it had reached agreement with Allied 
Signal, a major U.S. aircraft and automobile parts manufacturer 
(New Jersey, Chairman Lawrence A. Bossidy) to jointly develop an 
auxiliary power unit (APU) for small civil aircraft. KHI will 
assume 15 "risk and revenue sharing" involved in developing the 
APU and will be in charge of the development and production of 
gear boxes, an important element of the APU. 
  In addition to KHI, it has been decided that BMW and Rolls 
Royce (a joint venture company of Germany's BMW and the UK's 
Rolls Royce), as well as Italy's Alfa Romeo Avio, S.A., will 
participate in more or less equal proportions; thus the APU will 
be an international project jointly developed by four countries. 
The prospect is for development expenses to amount to about $5 
billion. The price per unit will be in the vicinity of &yen;35 
million and it is forecast that approximately 3000 units will be 
sold by the year 2015. 
  The APU will be installed in the rear of passenger planes 
and 
used for such purposes as starting the main engines and powering 
cabin air conditioning. Allied Signal holds about a 90 percent 
share of the world APU market. 
  It has been decided that the APU to be developed will be 
adopted for the "Gulfstream V," a business jet already under 
development by Gulfstream. The first APU is slated to be 
delivered to Gulfstream in May 1995.

  [Text] It was announced on 20 September 1993 that 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) will join with the 
diversified Candian firm Bombadier (located in Montreal) to 
develop the "Global Express," a long-distance business jet (see 
diagram showing the jet from three sides [diagram not included]) 
that will be able to fly from Tokyo to New York without landing 
en route. MHI will underwrite an estimated 10 percent of total 
development expenses, which will apparently be &yen;20 to 40 
billion, and will undertake the production of the main wing and 
the mid-section of the plane's fuselage. The Global Express will 
make its first flight in the latter half of 1996. MHI had worked 
on the twin-engine business plane "MU300" but was not 
successful, and transferred production and sales rights to Beech 
Aircraft of the United States in 1988; thus, the Global Express 
marks MHI's reentry into business planes after an absense of 
five years. 
  This is the first time that a Japanese manufacturer has 
teamed up with a foreign manufacturer to undertake joint 
international development in the business-plane field. This 
time, however, "participation in the Bombadier venture" seems 
close to becoming a reality. 
  The Global Express will have a wingspan of 28 meters and 
will 
measure about 30 meters in length. In the cabin are eight seats 
made to executive specifications. The plane will mount two BR710 
jet engines being jointly developed by Rolls Royce of the UK and 
BMW of Germany. Takeoff weight will be around 40 tons and the 
plane can transport about 20 people if all seats are installed, 
so it would seem that the aircraft can be used for such purposes 
as regular flights to remote areas. The plane is expected to be 
priced at &yen;2-3 billion. 
  The Global Express greatly exceeds the common perception of 
a 
business jet: its most outstanding characteristic is its range 
of 6,500 nautical miles (about 12,000 kilometers) with a crusing 
speed in the vicinity of Mach 0.85. It can fly without stopping 
between Chicago and Taipei, Los Angeles and Sydney, and New York 
and Tokyo -- trans-Pacific routes on which demand for passenger 
planes have been increasing. The Global Express is expected to 
be utilized by executives of transnational corporations and 
VIP's of various foreign governments. 
  U.S. and European manufacturers are prominent in the 
long-range, high-class business jet field, but only the United 
States' Gulfstream Corporation currently has specific 
development plans for such an aircraft. The word is that 
Bombadier envisions Global Express sales in the three figures 
and has expressed self-confidence regarding demand prospects for 
the plane. 
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Nagoya Aerospace Systems Plant 
will be in charge of the design, manufacture, and support of the 
Global Express's main wings and central fuselage section. How 
much will be invested had not been made public. 
  Bombadier has experienced rapid growth beginning with 
products such as railroad cars, small engines, and snowmobiles; 
it has a yearly turnover of about &yen;400 billion. Beginning in 
the latter half of the 1980's, Bombadier bought up the U.S. 
business jet manufacturer Learjet as well as Canada de Haviland, 
a small passenger jet manufacturer under the aegis of the United 
States' Boeing. Currently about two-thirds are accounted for by 
the civil aviation and defense sectors, such as by Canadair. 
  This year Canadair's announcement of the 7,000 kilometer 
range "604" in addition to the large business jet "Challenger" 
became topics of discussion at the 1993 Paris Air Show.

thereby firmly establish Japan's space shuttle technology, such 
as that involving leaving the atmosphere, reentry, and automatic 
landing. Toshiba believes that Japan's National Space 
Development Agency (NASDA), which is the primary entity 
conducting the project, will select as early as fiscal year 1993 
the firms to be in charge of the craft's guidance system and 
Toshiba intends to position itself to profit from orders placed 
for the guidance system by moving quickly to develop it. 
  What Toshiba has begun to develop is (1) a system to guide 
the shuttle by utilizing the global positioning system (GPS) 
prior to the shuttle's assuming the landing position, and (2) a 
microwave landing system to control the craft's landing orbit by 
microwaves sent out from the ground after the shuttle has been 
placed in position for landing. GPS is a system for determining 
three-dimensional positions by microwave sent out from U.S. 
military satellites; it is already being employed as a 
navigation system for aircraft and automobiles, and Toshiba will 
apply it for the Japanese-version space shuttle. Meanwhile, 
Toshiba is said to be planning to enhance the precision of the 
pilotless shuttle's radio reception, analysis, and other 
capabilities based upon the same guidance technology as the 
microwave landing system employed by aircraft. 
  Toshiba has organized a research and development team in its 
Komukai (Kawasaki City) Plant, which is Toshiba's development 
base for space-related equipment. Toshiba, aiming to be 
appointed to handle the experimental craft slated to be launched 
in 1999, will work on the quarters concerned for employment on 
the project. 
  The Japanese-version space shuttle has gained prominence as 
a 
key element in Japan's efforts to upgrade its space 
infrastructure, not only to regularly transport people and 
material between the ground and space, but also to be able to 
utilize space for such purposes as recovering and repairing 
satellites. It is hoped that it will prove helpful for the 
operation of the Japan Experimental Module (JEM) of the "Space 
Station," which is being planned as an international joint 
venture mainly under the direction of the United States. 
  Firmly establishing technology for reentry into the earth's 
atmosphere and guidance is a task for Japan to address; total 
costs for the 1999 shuttle launch is forecast to run about 
&yen;150 billion, a figure that includes the cost of developing 
the experimental craft and the cost of the launch.

  [Text] On 2 September 1993 the United States and Russia 
concluded a space cooperation agreement: basic agreement was 
reached on a cooperation concept that would allow the Russian 
Space Station MIR to dock with International Space Station 
Freedom. While the handshake between the two space powers could 
be viewed as invigorating the moribund Space Station Project, 
one could also make the sober observation that the agreement 
adds the unstable element of Russian participation. Japan, which 
participates in the Space Station Project, has been asked for a 
more nearly definite response than that sought from it up to now. 
  Following the signing of the agreement with Russian Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin, Vice President Gore emphasized that "two 
countries, who have been competitors in space development, have 
now entered an era of cooperation." The Vice President spoke as 
though a powerful supporter had been added. 
  The United States had three basic reasons for taking the 
decisive step of asking for Russian participation in the Space 
Station Project at this point: reducing costs, using Russian 
manned space technology built up by the operation of the MIR 
Space Station, and utilizing large Russian rockets for 
propulsion. 
  The construction budget under the original budget for Space 
Station Freedom was said to be $30 to $40 billion, but under the 
revised design the prospect is for costs to be held down as far 
as to about $25 billion. Using Russian technology would enable 
an even further reduction of consts. 
  As a result of the end of the Cold War there is no longer 
any 
need for the United States to compete with the former Soviet 
Union in space. Moreover the fiscal-deficit reduction measures 
advocated by President Clinton had strengthened the power of 
those opposed to the Space Station and had done so at a time 
when criticism of big science projects was mounting. 
  What made matters worse were the repeated delays of the 
launch of the space shuttle "Discovery" and the failure of the 
Mars probe "Mars Observer." The fragility of manned launch 
methods was revealed and the U.S. space program came under 
increased criticism in Congress due to the loss of the nearly $1 
billion budget for the Mars Observer without having achieved any 
results. 
  This crisis in U.S. space development accelerated 
cooperation 
in Russia. Naturally cooperation with the United States in space 
would have various benefits for Russia, such as in obtaining 
foreign currency. Russia is probably aiming to use cooperation 
in the Space Station Freedom Project to gain a foothold in 
entering the much desired Western space-services market. 
  Officials at Japan's Science and Technology Agency (STA) 
concerned with the Space Station acknowledged that they were 
almost completely taken by surprise when the United States and 
Russia agreed to cooperate in space this way. Their reaction was 
"who would have imagined that the United States would go as far 
as docking Space Station Freedom to the Mir Space Station?" 
  A unilateral review bearing on the Space Station Project was 
underway prompted by conditions on the U.S. side and it was on 
the verge of causing Japanese distrust of the United States. For 
a time members of STA and the National Space Development Agency 
(NASDA) were seized with the uneasy feeling that the United 
States might make another change in the program without 
consulting them first. It was 9 September, two days after 
signing the agreement with Russia, that the United States 
formally briefed the countries with which it was cooperating, 
such as Japan, about the agreement. Cooperating countries' 
questions naturally focused on how Russia's participation would 
affect the Space Station. 
  On that occasion the United States presented a space-station 
design final draft that posited on quadrilateral participation 
by the United States, Japan, Europe, and Canada. The United 
States emphasized that it was a draft design flexible enough to 
accomodate docking or not docking with Mir. STA officials 
participating in the meeting stated that they were "somewhat 
relieved to find that the United States was more cautious than 
we had previously thought on considering Russian participation 
in the Space Station." It seems, however, that Russia's 
participation cannot avoid having some effect on the project. 
For example, in order to enable joint use of the Space Station 
by both the United States and Russia, the shuttle will have to 
be launched to a higher orbit latitude than previously planned. 
In that event the space shuttle's payload would be reduced and 
there is a possibility that this would have an effect upon 
scheduling and the scale of cooperating country facilities. 
  The United States points to the possibility that the overall 
program will be expedited by Russia's participation. There are, 
however, reports to the effect that the Japanese Experimental 
Module (JEM) will be delayed by one to two years from its 
initially planned 1999 launch. For the time being STA's stance 
is to watch what the United States is doing. 
  Th U.S.-Russian agreement symbolizes the end of the Cold War 
in the space area. In order to actually orbit a space station in 
which the major nations of the world participate Japan will be 
asked to take a different approach than it has up to now, such 
as by closing its eyes to its convenience and switching to a 
position supporting the project.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., (MHI) will mount 
a serious effort to convert Defense Agency old-style fighter 
planes to pilotless target aircraft. Radio piloting equipment 
will be installed on retained stocks of F-104J fighter planes 
retired from active service in 1985. The cost of refitting the 
F-104's will come to about &yen;600 million per plane and six 
planes have been ordered for Fiscal Year 1993 (FY-93). The 
production of F-15 interceptor-fighter aircraft by MHI's 
Aircraft Division has peaked and the firm's sales can be 
expected to be further reduced by slower growth in the budget 
for front-line armaments. MHI hopes to make up for the decline 
in its work on new planes by publicizing its pioletless-aircraft 
technology to win orders to refit a total of around 20 aircraft. 
  In 1990, MHI delivered to the Defense Agency two F-104's 
that 
it had refitted with pilotless technology. The two planes were, 
however, designed to also allow piloted flight; the two planes 
were intended to collect various kinds of data on pilotless 
flight and could be described as being at the experimental stage. 
  The F104 was once a masterpiece said to be "the ultimate in 
manned flight," but refitting it with pilotless technology was 
difficult and took time because, among other things, the plane's 
landing speed is fast since it becomes unstable at slow speeds. 
  MHI resolved the technical problems in experiments that it 
conducted up to FY92 and received orders for six planes in FY93, 
so it's beginning full-fledged refittings in order to convert 
the planes to completely pilotless aircraft at its Nagoya 
Aerospace Systems Komaki South Plant (located in Toyoyama 
Township, Aichi Prefecture). MHI plans to have all the planes 
delivered by the beginning of FY93. 
  The Defense Agency has kept in stock 20 or more F-104's that 
it has not disposed of by disassembly, and MHI believes that 
there will be a demand for refitting them as pilotless aircraft 
beginning in FY94. 
  In addition to being able to fly on a pre-programmed course 
the pilotless planes will be able to be controlled by radio 
while monitoring it by television from the ground. Moreover, if 
the pilotless planes go beyond the range that they can receive 
radio signals they will automatically return to skies within 
radio reception. The Air Self-Defense Forces plan to utilize the 
refitted F-104's as target aircraft in training around Iwo Jima. 
Currently MHI is mainly occupied with such tasks as producing 
F-15 interceptor-fighter aircraft under license for the Air 
Self-Defense Forces and sharing the production of the civilian 
passenger plane Boeing 777. The production of F-15's has already 
peaked and the production of civilian passenger planes has 
slumped due to the world-wide recession in the airline industry. 
MHI hopes to receive refitting-work orders as a way of 
maintaining sales until the next-generation FSX fighter begins 
to be mass-produced.

  [Text] A prominent feature of the Gulf War was the use of 
precision guided ordnance using computers. The sight of a 
missile trying to arrest another missile was sufficient to prove 
the validity of the air-defense system based on electronic 
equipment. Components that are produced by Japan Radio Co., Ltd. 
are the constituents of various guided ordnance and the 
"electronic eyes" that support the heart of the defense system. 
They cast watchful eyes on the sneaking enemies. 
  Of the FY92 sales totaling &yen;140.2 billion, the sale made 
to the Defense Agency amounted to about 14&percnt;. Although the 
ratio 
was as high as about 20&percnt; in the late 1980s, it has been 
declining since affected by the defense budget cut. Manabu 
Narasaki, a director in charge of the defense business, comments 
painfully, "we would like to think that we have reached the 
bottom; nevertheless, we are prepared to see a further erosion, 
even to the 10&percnt; line." The reduction of the contracts in 
terms 
of yen value is serious, as they forecast the FY93 sale to fall 
back to about &yen;16 billion, a whopping 30&percnt; reduction 
from 
the previous year. 
  The equipment related to guided ordnance such as missile and 
the electronic equipment for antisubmarine patrol aircraft are 
their two major product lines, the combined sales amount of 
which amounts to 60-70&percnt; of the total defense-related 
sales of 
the company. In addition to those product lines, they make 
communication equipment, radar, and various simulators. 
  The main pillar of the guided ordnance products is the 
ground 
radar which controls the surface-to-air missile, "Hawk." Hawk 
homes in on the target tagging along the radio wave reflected by 
the target while the radar scans the target with the radio wave. 
It is intended to track down and capture an object flying at a 
relatively low speed, such as an airplane flying in formation 
and a missile released by a fighter. The ground radar is an eye 
of the Hawk system to look for the enemy in distance. 
  As to the missile-related business, the company also 
supplies 
the communication equipment for the surface-to-air missile, 
"Patriot," and the radio altimeter to be built into 
surface-to-surface missiles. 
  The electronic equipment for antisubmarine patrol aircraft 
captures the movement of submarines that cannot be captured by 
radars. The system functions in such a way that buoys dropped on 
the sea surface emit radio waves which bounce off the submarine 
and are collected by the patrol plane via the buoys. The 
electronic equipment the company supplies is used to receive the 
signal and deliver the data to a system that is used to identify 
the location of the submarine. 
  The nucleus of their defense business relates to the 
front-line equipment which tends to be strongly affected by the 
defense budget cut, so that they cannot expect any increase in 
the foreseeable future. Therefore, they are considering the 
conversion of their defense technology to commercial 
applications. 
  "We will investigate the possibility of venturing into the 
amusement industry (game machines, etc.)," says Mr. Narasaki 
boldly. They seem to be considering a drastic shift to 
commercial fields utilizing the technology they mastered through 
the development of aircraft pilot training simulators. 
  They developed the simulator originally for the trainer 
planes of the Air Self-Defense Force. "The business is quite 
unpredictable, and sometimes there is no order for more than a 
year," says Kzaue Mukogawa, General Manager of Defense Sales. 
When it comes to the commercial airline industry, they still 
favor imported products so that Japan Radio has been able to 
sell only less than 20 units so far, mainly to All Nippon 
Airways. 
  "Simulator sales occur only when new airplanes are adopted 
by 
the industry," says Mr. Narasaki; with the airline industry in 
such a depressed state they are currently in, there is little 
hope for this business to expand appreciatively. 
  That is why they think that a higher growth potential can be 
created, if they shift their effort toward "non-aircraft" 
business such as game equipment, by means of adding multi-media 
output, i.e., voice, character and image, to the simulator 
technology. 
  Accompanying the sales drop in the defense sector of their 
business, the number of employees related to the sector has been 
continuously decreasing. At the moment, it only amounts to about 
14&percnt; of 3,900, the total number of people the company 
employs. 
The company claims that it has no intention of further reducing 
the number as it wants to sustain the defense-specific 
technology and know-how. However, they must generate a necessary 
earning to support all the employees and their families through 
business expansions utilizing the defense element technology 
they have nurtured. The informed sources in the industry 
predict, however, that it will be difficult for them to go 
beyond their boundary of communication and electronic equipment 
manufacturing even if they succeed in venturing into commercial 
fields. The key to the survival of the defense division of this 
company is whether they can successfully enter into new business 
sectors such as the amusement equipment industry while making 
sure not to miss any renewal orders of the front-line equipment 
they delivered in the past and maintenance service contracts.

  [Text] "A vendor's (subcontractor's) business is tough. We 
must become a prime (prime contractor)." Despite the fact that 
it is the top brand in the commercial computer industry, Fujitsu 
has to be content with a humble position behind such outshining 
contenders as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi 
Electric when it comes to the defense-related business. Fujitsu 
has been longing for many years for the position of a "prime 
contractor" because being a prime contractor empowers them to 
dictate the technology. 
  The dwindling growth rate of the government defense budget 
has been a hard blow to Fujitsu as well. The total amount of its 
contract with the Defense Agency for FY93 is expected to be 
about &yen;33 billion. It is a substantial drop from the peak 
figure of about &yen;38 billion (FY91). However, as Norio 
Nakamura, General Manager of Special Equipment System Div., 
says, "it's not bad for us that the focus of the defense budget 
is shifting from the front-line equipment to the rear support 
elements." With abundant experience in the computer technology, 
the company can compete more favorably in the field of the rear 
support elements than the front-line equipment such as fighters 
and missiles. A typical case is an information communication 
system called CI (Command Control Communication Intelligence). 
  In FY91, the company successfully attained the prime 
contractor position when it got the contract to build a 
nationwide information communication system called "GSDF Command 
System." The project is to build the nationwide system with the 
annual budget of several billion yen, starting from the Northern 
Army located in Hokkaido, where Fujitsu is the leader of a group 
of subcontractors including Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, Hitachi, 
Toshiba, and Oki. "The ratio between front-line equipment vs. 
rear support elements in the contract amounts used to be about 2 
to 1 five years ago, but it is now 1 to 2," says Mr. Nakamura. 
  The company is at the valley of the orders for the moment. 
Although it received an order for the electronic equipment to be 
borne by P3C antisubmarine patrol airplane, which amounts to 
&yen;500 million per set, it will not continue very long as the 
implementation of the airplane will be over soon. The project 
for the equipment of the ground support center for P3C (ASWOC) 
to be installed at various bases starting with Atsugi and 
Hachinohe, which amounted to slightly less than &yen;3 billion, 
was finally completed last year when it finished the 
installation at Iwakuni. The short distance surface-to-air 
missile (Short SAM) project, in which Fujitsu participated as a 
vendor for Toshiba, will soon be entering a remodeling period. 
  On the other hand, some optimistic opinions have recently 
surfaced as exemplified by Mr. Nakamura's comment, "it will be 
bottoming out soon." The company has accumulated a substantial 
amount of technology. It recently delivered an electronic 
warfare performance evaluation system for the F15 
interceptor-fighter. This system installed at the Gifu Base of 
ASDF at the cost of over &yen;10 billion is capable of 
conducting simulated electronic warfare using an F15 hung from 
the ceiling of a huge hangar. It tests the counteracting 
capability against the enemy's electronic jamming. The company 
is planning to propose a modification to enable it to handle the 
FSX next generation support fighter. 
  The infrared technology is another strong point of this 
company. Fujitsu is leading the world neck and neck with 
Mitsubishi Electric in the development of Infrared Charged 
Couple Device (IRCCD) which is used for detecting the quantity 
of infrared rays emitted by any object, in other words, the 
temperature difference. The infrared night vision device using 
the JRCCD technology it developed is expected to be used on the 
OHX next generation small size helicopter for GSDF. It is 
assumed that approximately 180 OHX helicopters will be purchased 
eventually, so that this infrared night vision device costing 
about &yen;50 million will be a stable source of business for 
the company. 
  According to a source at the Defense Agency, "the only area 
where Japanese defense industry can compete against the leading 
defense industries of the world may be the information software 
and the cutting edge semiconductor technology." Now that the 
time where tanks and airplanes are the leading roles is over, 
the "dark horse" Fujitsu is ready to advance to the front row.

  [Text] The defense business of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy 
Industries Co., Ltd. ("IHI") consists of aircraft engines and 
ships. Although the company's business has grown to the current 
level keeping pace with the equipment expansion of the Defense 
Agency, it is now facing the worldwide arms reduction and the 
national defense budget cut as a result thereof. Therefore, the 
company is hurrying to shift its focus from the defense-related 
business to commercial targets in the aircraft engine business, 
while, in the defense ship business, desperately seeking a 
prescription for its survival amidst the volatile demands. Since 
the Japanese defense industry has no means of exporting its 
products, the Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program is its lifeline. 
The original budget for the front-line equipment in the Mid-Term 
Defense Buildup Program for FY91-95 was about &yen;5 trillion, a 
reduction of 2.3&percnt; from the actual spending during the 
previous 
term. This figure was further reduced to about &yen;4.44 
trillion due to the financial reasons of the government and 
various overseas situations. 
  One thing that is surely to be affected, as a result, is 
their defense ship business. Eight ships originally planned to 
be built under the Mid-Term Program is now reduced to six. Two 
have already been ordered, where IHI got the contract to build 
one of them. Of the four more ships to be ordered, two are 
expected to be ordered in FY94 and the remaining two will be 
ordered in FY95. 
  The order IHI received for the hull is said to be about 
&yen;28 billion, and is a substantial chunk of business for the 
IHI's Ship and Ocean Division whose total sales was &yen;130.2 
billion in the year ended in March 1993. Since "the outlook for 
the next Mid-Term Program is not particularly bright," according 
to an IHI source, they must be wanting to secure an order of one 
ship each for the next two years as soon as possible. 
  The difficulty with the defense ship building business is 
that the company has to maintain a certain number of 
professional engineers all the time regardless of whether they 
have orders or not. While the hull and general equipment can be 
manufactured with the help of commercial ship engineers, "there 
is absolutely no way to use the stand-ins on the weapon system," 
says Yoshito Igarashi, General Manager of Defense Ship Division. 
  The Tokyo No. 1 Plant (Kohtoh-ku, Tokyo), the core of its 
defense ship production, has 750 employees including 150 
engineers. When it had absolutely no orders during FY87-FY90, 
"We couldn't just tell them to cut grass in the plant to kill 
time. We had to keep our engineers by letting them study for 
building large ships in the next time around, or work on repairs 
of defense ships, or sending them abroad for advanced studies," 
says Mr. Igarashi. There is no question the company paid a 
fortune for this. 
  Therefore, the plant finally began to take in works for 
building commercial ships including a 35,000 ton class tanker 
and a 20,000 ton class ferry boat when they didn't have defense 
ship building jobs. This was done just to "keep the building 
berth occupied." 
  On the other hand, about 70&percnt; of the total annual 
sales, 
&yen;132,792 million (for the year ended March 1992), of the 
Aerospace Division comes from the defense-related business, 
consisting mainly of the manufacturing and repairs of the 
fighters and trainers engines for the Self-Defense Forces. 
  Noting this critical situation that "the defense demands are 
already showing declines at the incoming order level" (Mototsugu 
Ito, Assistant General Manager of the Aerospace Division), they 
are currently planning to change the defense/commercial business 
ratio to 50/50, and increase the annual sales to &yen;200 
billion. 
  The key item in the scheme for expanding commercial sales is 
the gas turbine engine for electric power generation, a product 
based on the conversion of aircraft engines, for which they have 
a high hope of "reaching &yen;80-85 billion sales in the year 
2000." 
  During the months of February to July this year, 20-30 
engineers were added to the gas turbine design group, while 
adding about 20 to the sales department as well. Their target is 
"South-East Asia where a good demand should exist for power 
stations and co-generation facilities, because of their chronic 
shortage of electricity (Mr. Ito)." 
  However, it is still uncertain how the domestic demand will 
be affected by the lingering depression. Although they are 
working on several medium to small co-generation projects at the 
moment, order issuing is often delayed. 
  In addition to gas turbine applications, they are also 
trying 
to develop a market for commercial aircraft engines as a means 
of expanding commercial sales, but the problem there is "the 
tough cost competition that deteriorates profitability (Mr. 
Ito)." 
  The difficulty of the defense industry is that once you pull 
out, it will be almost impossible to rejoin the business. Since 
they are well aware that "the defense business takes a lot of 
time to nurture; once you destroy it, it is almost impossible to 
restore it (Mr. Igarashi)," the biggest challenge for them is 
how to preserve their engineering capability.

  [Text] OHX small observation/reconnaissance helicopter for 
the Ground Self-Defense Force, a replacement to the current OH6 
model, is being developed as the first helicopter to be 
developed here based on purely local technology. While the 
fuselage is being developed under the cooperation of Kawasaki 
Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Fuji Heavy 
Industries, Kawasaki's plays the biggest role as the prime 
controller. It is in charge of developing about 70&percnt; of the 
fuselage including the front fuselage and the rotor. 
  The total sale of Kawasaki's Aerospace Division in FY92 was 
about &yen;230 billion. The total sale in FY93 is expected to 
reduce to about &yen;190 billion, because, among other things, 
the number of P3C antisubmarine patrol planes they produce as 
the prime contractor has been reduced. Furthermore, it looks 
like their business will be affected in the future by the budget 
cut of the Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program introduced at the 
end of last year. 
  That being the case, their expectation for OHX is flying 
high. If we assume that OHX will be deployed in a similar scale 
as OH6, it means a project of about 180 helicopters, amounting 
to a figure over &yen;100 billion. It is certain that it will be 
a stable source of income for Kawasaki, while the defense 
spending is declining across the board. 
  An informed source at the Defense Agency points out that, 
"it 
is the Defense Agency's intention to seek an effective use of 
the limited budget in accordance with the sharing of 
responsibilities such that fighters are to be built by 
Mitsubishi, and helicopters by Kawasaki." 
  A main pillar of the commercial business to compensate for 
the reduction of orders from the Defense Agency is the 
production sharing plan of the new commercial jet, Boeing 777. 
Unfortunately, due to the poor business conditions the airlines 
are experiencing, the production is still at the pace of one a 
month. It is expected to take at least two more years to reach 
the production pace of three to four planes a month. 
  The helicopter business is an ace of the commercial market 
as 
well. 
  The attention-getter here is BK117, a commercial helicopter, 
which was developed by Kawasaki in cooperation with Deutsche 
Aerospace of Germany and Aerospatiale of France. Although the 
incoming order level has dropped since the bubble bursting of 
the economy, "there is yet a strong demand potential at various 
central government branches and local governments," says 
Nobuhiko Tatebe, Director and Assistant General Manager of 
Aerospace Division. 
  One such potential is the use of helicopters for the 
Emergency Medical Service (EMS). It is the transport service for 
rescuing patients from remote islands and mountain areas. 
Although they have not sold any helicopters for this application 
due to the pending legal issues and the lack of infrastructures, 
they will appeal to the public and authorities through 
demonstrations using actual helicopters. 
  The company's effort on R&amp;D is also strong. They 
developed 
for the first time in Japan the fly-by-wire (FBW) technology for 
the helicopter to replace the hydraulic system hitherto used. In 
this system, in place of a regular stick, a small stick is used 
and the delicate movement of the fuselage is detected by 
sensors. The computer will understand the pilot's intention, and 
sends signal to the control device of the rotor. The system is 
currently tested on an actual helicopter. 
  Some of these cutting-edge technologies have already been 
applied to practical uses. One example is the OPS navigation 
system which determines the location of the helicopter based on 
the data received from satellites. "It automatically displays 
the altitude and the height of an obstructing object on the 
ground to enhance flight safety," says Mr. Tatebe with a pride. 
  Some of the executives of the heavy industry here have 
voiced 
an opinion that, "there is no base for the aircraft industry to 
grow in Japan." On the other hand, Ryozo Tsutsui, Executive 
Director of Kawasaki (formerly Director General of the Technical 
Research and Development Institute of the Defense Agency), 
predicts that, "the currency of the 21st century is technology." 
What he means is that the technology of a nation or a company 
will be the key factor that determines the negotiation power of 
said nation or company. It is safe to say that the helicopter is 
the lifeline for Kawasaki for maintaining its basic aircraft 
manufacturing technology.

  [Text] It is possible to set goals for the application of 
fast breeder reactors (FBRs) that are to be ready by the first 
half of the 21st century. As the FBRs secure safety, the amount 
of resources and the economics will sufficiently concur with 
light water reactors (LWRs), and possibly it will become the 
main facility for generating electricity. This type of results 
from research were reported on 8 June at a meeting held by the 
Atomic Energy Commission of Japan-FBR Development and Planning 
Specialist Subcommittee. The research made together by Japan 
Nuclear Power Plant and by the Power Reactor and Fuel 
Development Corporation (PNC) has concretely shown that their 
goal is aimed toward future accomplishments in technical 
development. It points out that in order to materialize such 
goals it is necessary to devise a long term and a well planned 
match. The research outline will be introduced in two issues. 
<H5>  Preface </H5>
  The development of our country's FBR has been considered as 
one of the most important subjects concerning the country's 
nuclear power policy and has been advanced under the cooperation 
of both government and people. The technology of FBR beginning 
with basic foundational research goes back to over 20 years of 
development to reach the present stage where it is now ready to 
test operate the model reactor, "Monjyu," and it has reached the 
level to where application is possible. 
  In order to complete FBR as commercial power reactors, it 
would not only have to be economical but would have to be 
planned for its utmost safety and reliability. By early 21st 
century (about 2020-2030), about the time it is ready for 
commercialization, it is going to be necessary to prepare for 
the heightening of public acceptance. For this reason, the 
construction and operation of demonstration reactors following 
"Monjyu" should be advanced faithfully. It is also necessary to 
accumulate technology and experience and to perform technical 
development and demonstrations leading to application. 
  For the application of FBRs, at the same time the technical 
development of the reactor is being made, the fuel cycle (fuel 
production and recycle) should also be studied. It is necessary 
to plan improvements for the complete FBR system including the 
fuel cycle for its safety and its economy. 
  Assuming the commercial operation of an FBR application 
plant 
is possible by early 21st century, in order to make it more 
attractive than the prevailing LWR, the following must be 
considered: 1) A need exists to establish goals to improve 
economical aspects, safety, reliability, operation, maintenance 
and repair; 2) For a clear view of the future, a construction of 
an application plant design is needed so a generalized direction 
can be searched; 3) Technical developments in order to 
materialize the above has been put together as a concept. 
<H5>  The Goals Toward Application of FBR </H5>
  To materialize an FBR plant that would be more attractive 
than the existing LWR of the same generation would mean 
recognizing the positive aspects of FBR, overcoming necessary 
subjects compared to LWR, analyzing the future movements 
concerning LWRs, and to identify the views of each of the 
established goals. From the above, the economic characteristics 
and safety goals toward application was established. The 
following are main goals for development. 
<H5>  Economy </H5>
  1) Compared to LWR, the largest element contributing to the 
construction cost would be the nuclear reactor structure, 
cooling system and fuel handling system. Considering the above, 
the goal is to make use of the sodium system characteristics as 
follows: 


    -  Simplifying the system; 
  -  Reducing and simplifying 
equipment and structures; 
  -  Integrating equipment and 
structures. 

    2) By putting into practical use the advantages of FBR, the 
aim should be to reduce fuel cost and to lower the cost of 
generating electricity. It can be done by: 


    -  Increased combustibility; 
  -  Creating high temperature 
and high heat efficiency in the plant. 

<H5>    Safety </H5>
  Assuming conditions where many commercial FBRs will be 
operating, the goal should be for utmost safety and easily 
understandable safety procedures for the public. 


    -  Core that is highly safe (improvement in the core 
characteristics). 
  -  Safe facilities (passive equipment and system 
application) having high reliability. 

<H5>    Reliability, Operation, and Maintenance-Repair </H5>
  While accepting the advancement and technical developments 
made for LWRs, and reflecting on the plant designs, 
construction, and operational experiences made by the model and 
demonstration reactors, an improvement in reliability, 
operation, and maintenance-repair can be gained for the FBRs. 
  Together with all these goals set for applications of FBRs, 
from the viewpoint of making use of the FBR's original 
characteristics, it is necessary to advance technical 
development and to establish sophistication of the plutonium 
utilizing system that includes a total fuel cycle system 
containing new type fuel and TRU recycle. 
<H5>  The Application Reactor Plant Design </H5>
  The application of FBRs can only be accomplished by basing 
it 
on future outlook of new technological developments, its 
applications to plant designs followed by the actual 
construction of the plant, operation and repairs etc., and 
through the accumulation of demonstrations and experiments. 
  As an outlook to the future, in order to obtain prospective 
of the direction to be taken by technical developments and 
financial aspects of the application of FBRs, the formerly 
mentioned developmental goals based on economics and safety 
aspects have been referred to and the designs of application 
reactors (five types of reactors) have been constructed. (The 
figures are examples of two reactor designs.) 






  The following considerations were made in the construction 
of 
the application reactor design. 
  1) In regard to the size of power outputs, assuming that a 
period for applications when many FBRs would be constructed in 
concurrence with large LWRs will come, similar to the LWR, an 
economically superior large reactor will be the subject for the 
plant design. 
  The economical aspect will depend on the scale effect which 
will depend on the power output size. In addition, it will be 
affected by the standardization and module effects which depend 
on the number of reactors constructed. 
  2) Concerning the fuel form, mixed oxide fuel (MOX) which at 
this point in time has a record of high experience and 
accomplishments together with especially high degree of 
technical proficiency would be the object. Of the newer fuels 
such as nitrides and metallics, the actual demonstrations will 
be for future topics and whether to adapt them will only be 
decided from future technical developments. 
  3) In regard to reactor cores, assuming the conditions that 
several commercial FBRs will be built and be in operation, the 
object will be to aim for a core that is highly safe and easily 
understandable to the public despite the possibility of an 
economical impact (improvements to the core characteristics 
accompanied by an increase in the diameter of the core). 
  4) About the economical and safety aspects, a renovative 
technology that would contribute largely to its upgrading is 
expected, and will be incorporated into the plant design after 
consideration of its application possibility and time factor is 
made. The evaluation of the economical aspect up to date is to 
target a 70&percnt; reduction of nuclear reactor and cooling 
system 
amount of resources below that of LWR. 
  In order to construct an improved economical plant design, 
the following points have been listed. 


    -  Integration of equipment by adopting large capacity 
electromagnetic immersion pump; 
  -  Simplification and 
standardization of equipment structure by adopting shock proof 
technology; 
  -  Elimination of secondary sodium system 
(intermediate heat transfer system). 

    Results from the summarized evaluation of the construction 
of 
the plant design are given as follows: 
  1) In order that FBRs can economically concur with LWRs, it 
is believed necessary that the plant construction cost would 
have to be kept at approximately 110&percnt; of LWR. FBR plants 
have 
large scale merits that accompany its capability for large power 
output. Furthermore, in contrast to the construction cost of the 
original reactor (FOAK cost), by introducing several reactors, 
it is anticipated the construction cost (NOAK cost) will be 
reduced approximately 20&percnt; due to mastery effects. The 
present 
demonstration reactor No. 1 consists of large power output of 
1.3 million KW and due to the mastery effect gained from 
commercial introduction, it has been evaluated to be in the area 
of 110&percnt; of LWR. 
  2) In directing FBR toward application and in order that it 
establish the utmost highest goals, the achievement of the 
economic aspects of the first reactor concurred with LWR were 
investigated and the results were as follows: 
  (i) In the case of secondary sodium system existing plant, 
it 
is believed there will be some difference arising in the plant 
designs following the advancement in future equipment planning 
techniques. However, the evaluation at this point shows there 
are no effects from methods used for equipment integration and 
it remains almost the same. At any rate, the amount of resources 
for the nuclear reactor and the cooling system was about 
70&percnt; of 
LWR and the construction cost was 97-104&percnt;. It is 
anticipated 
that the construction cost should be around 80&percnt; after the 
introduction of several reactors. 
  In these application reactor plant designs, in addition to 
the techniques adapted in the plans for the already developed 
demonstration reactor No. 1, additional improvements in the 
reactor core characteristics, equipment integration by large 
volume immersion electromagnetic pump, shock proof, 
simplification of upper reactor etc. are made using new 
technology. Already, concerning these reform techniques, they 
have been realized inside and outside of this country, efforts 
have begun toward its materialization, and the prospects of 
development are good. 
  Furthermore, the construction cost can be reduced by the 
application of FBR's scale merit obtained by enlarging the power 
output to 1.5 million KW, or by adapting the twin plant formula 
of common usage of the used fuel handling facility which shares 
a large portion of the FBR expense. 
  (ii) For the secondary sodium system elimination plant, it 
turns out that the amount of resource for nuclear reactor and 
cooling system would be approximately 60&percnt; of LWR and 
90&percnt; for 
construction cost. The estimate in construction cost would be 
around 70&percnt; after introduction of several reactors. 
  Therefore, even if the three dimensional shock proof and 
secondary sodium system elimination techniques were not adapted, 
at the present, the renovation technology (equipment integration 
through enlarging capacity and using immersion electromagnetic 
pump) is the only one that can maintain a clear view of the 
developmental period, and possibly approach facing the 
accomplishment of the goal set for application of FBRs.

<H5>  Technical Development Towards Application Reactors </H5>
  In order to develop necessary techniques in time for the 
application of FBRs, a long term planning of research 
development is necessary along with plant demonstrations. The 
following will point out the development of concrete goals and 
directions for the important techniques. 
  Reactor Core: In order to advance towards the best way for 
the general public to understand safety, it would be necessary 
to work together to diversify the reactor suspension system and 
raise reliability for reactor cores. At the same time, it is 
necessary to find a specially unique policy that will grapple 
the upgrading of the reaction core characteristics: 
  -- The development of reactor core design that applies to 
the 
negative reactivity input factors contributed by passive 
features such as expansion and curving. 
  -- The embodying of thoughts on the creation of a new 
reactor 
core concept under the setting that it can withstand unusual 
situations while retaining a stable condition. 
  -- The sophistication of analysis and evaluation techniques 
concerning the reactor core movements during unusual situations. 
  -- The sophistication of reliability of the reactor 
suspension mechanism by diversification of the core suspension 
system. 
  The Removal of Heat of Decay: The attainment of reliability 
in removing the heat of decay together with reliability in the 
core characteristics and reactor suspension system contributes 
in a large way to the safety upgrading of the nuclear reactor. 
With FBRs, due to the fact that the cooling material sodium has 
a high boiling temperature, it is possible to use low pressure 
design. Since the operational temperature is high, the 
dispersion of heat into the atmosphere as the final heat sink is 
possible. In addition, the natural physical phenomena of 
circulation by difference in density can be easily utilized. 
Consequently, there are many merits that can be realized in 
acquiring highly reliable system for the removal of heat of 
decay. 
  In order for technical developments to take place, these 
merits are to be made use of and the goal is the upgrading of 
reliability through simplification and diversification of the 
system: 
  -- The development of analytical and evaluation methods for 
natural physical phenomena such as natural circulation. 
  -- The technical development of system design and plant 
design utilizing natural physical phenomena. 
  -- The development of passive/static equipment and its 
method 
of control. 
  The Integration and Simplification of Equipment: By 
integrating and simplifying the nuclear reactor and the cooling 
system equipment which consumes a large portion of the plant 
construction cost, large improvements in savings can be 
anticipated. 
  1) The development of an electromagnetic pump and the 
integration of cooling equipment. 
  Electromagnetic pumps contain no moving parts such as 
rotating parts, and therefore, it can acquire high reliability. 
It can be relocated with large degree of freedom, and also 
installation into the cooling system equipment is easy etc. It 
possesses various merits in the process of integrating 
circulation pumps and heat exchangers. 
  These merits are to be utilized for technical developments 
and while raising reliability, a rational integration of cooling 
equipment should materialize, and the goal for improving its 
economical aspect should be possible: 
  -- The development of a large capacity immersion 
electromagnetic pump. 
  -- The demonstration of reliability in the integration of 
large capacity cooling system equipment. 
  2) The simplification of upper reactor structure and the 
fuel 
exchange facilities. 
  In FBRs where sodium is used for cooling, it is necessary to 
perform fuel exchange without opening the nuclear reactor 
container. Since it involves complicated structure consisting of 
rotating plugs, the simplification of the upper reactor 
structure will contribute to economical savings. The upper 
reactor structure has to maintain the control drive mechanism 
and consequently it requires high rigidity. Therefore, a unique 
and simplified upper reactor structure combined with shock proof 
technique would be very effective. 
  There are various ideas under consideration for the 
simplification of the upper reactor structure such as 
eliminating the rotating plugs and resituating the reactor core 
upper structure equipment to upper and lower levels and 
performing fuel exchange but the goal is to use what is 
considered the most economical method of elastic fluctuating 
form upper level reactor structure: 
  -- The development of the elastic fluctuating form upper 
level reactor structure. 
  Fuel: In regards to fuel development, it is to attain lower 
power generating cost, increase in the margin of safety or the 
compacting of the core, the goal is for the sophistication of 
fuel. 
  -- The development of high temperature creep strength and 
swell resistant superior pipe covering material. 
  -- The development of hollow fuel. 
  Removal of Secondary Sodium (Intermediate Heat Transport) 
System: In regards to improving the economics for FBRs, the 
integration and simplification of equipment mentioned above 
would be an effective method, but the most unique way would be a 
plan that has to do with eliminating the secondary sodium 
(intermediate heat transport) system that is characteristic to 
the FBR and that was built to accompany using sodium for cooling 
material. 
  In order that the elimination of the secondary sodium can 
take place, it would have to be by using highly reliable double 
pipe steam generating equipment and a damage detector system 
which will prevent sodium-water reaction accidents from 
happening along with a completely equipped logic and data so as 
to avoid the assumed mode the double pipe could simultaneously 
become damaged. At the same time, by hypothesizing the situation 
where a penetration leak may occur, a leak detection technology 
to cope with the situation, an accident control system and the 
development of safety evaluation techniques are going to be 
needed: 
  -- The development of a double pipe steam generator and the 
demonstration of its reliability. 
  -- The development of damage detective system that is 
adaptable and reliable. 
  -- The development of control technology and evaluation 
technique for sodium-water reaction accidents. 
  Shock Proof: By using the shock proof design, and comparing 
it with the shock resistant plan, it is possible for the nuclear 
reactor and cooling system equipment to be made lighter and 
simpler. In addition, the plant designs can be normalized which 
all leads to large cost savings. At this point, the horizontal 
shock proof technique is in the process of being the perspective 
choice, but looking towards FBR application, it is desirable to 
develop a three dimensional shock proof technique. 
  In the field of technical development, in combination with 
equipment development for shock proof elements, the goal is to 
standardize shock proofing: 
  -- The establishment of horizontal shock proof technique and 
the development of three dimensional shock proof technique. 
  -- The establishing of a standard shock proof plan. 
  Sodium Middle Structure, Equipment Inspection and Repair 
Technique: In the case of FBRs, equipment inspection and/or 
repair of the nuclear reactor systems structure has the problem 
of being more difficult compared to the inspection and repair of 
sodium middle structure equipments of LWRs because of its usage 
of high temperature, opaque and active sodium. 
  From the viewpoint of FBR reliability and plant availability 
factor, it is necessary to plan for further sophistication of 
inspection and repair techniques.

<H5>  Sophistication and Diversification </H5>
  1) New Type Fuels. In regards to new type fuels such as 
nitride and metallic fuels, viewing from the point of its 
economics and safety, their future appears to be brighter than 
with the mixed oxides, and consequently, it is necessary to 
aggressively make feasibility studies and accumulate irradiation 
results. Furthermore, concerning the technical aspects of fuel 
production and recycling, the nitride fuels are technically on 
the same extension line with the presently existing MOX 
techniques. Therefore, it is believed that the outlook for its 
application is going to be easier to attain. 
  2) Medium Reactors and Small Reactors. By utilizing an 
appropriate size power output reactor core, it is possible to 
secure the reliability for the cores passive safety 
characteristics and the heat of decay removal system with ease. 
  In concurrence with the technical development directed 
towards commercial large power generating reactors, the catching 
on of the developmental movements of medium and small sized 
reactors were investigated. As a result, in response to the 
diversified needs in the future, the foundations to satisfy 
these needs are to be built: 
  -- Investigation of characteristics of medium and small 
sized 
reactors. 
  -- Investigation of safety of medium and small sized plants. 
  -- Investigation of the conception of medium and small sized 
plants. 
  3) Fuel Cycle. In regards to the technical development of 
fuel cycling for FBRs, further sophistication and application in 
fuel production, processing and recycling techniques are planned 
for the exceptionally high degree technically mature MOX. Also 
from the viewpoint of planning for the sophistication and 
harmony for the entire fuel cycle system, the TRU combustion 
technique and TRU recycling technical development are being 
promoted. 
  Consequently, it will be necessary to coordinate and advance 
the development of reactor cores and fuel with these fuel 
cycling technical development movements. 
  In Conclusion: Before the assumed FBR commercial application 
would be in effect by the early part of the 21st century, the 
FBRs would concur with LWR and the possibility points to the 
direction that they would become the main power generating 
facilities by then. 
  In order for FBRs to be applied, the advancement and 
fixation 
of the technical development of FBRs must be made through the 
construction and operation of first the model reactor followed 
by the demonstration reactor. In addition, the commitments for 
long term and well planned technical developments are going to 
be necessary for the following. 
  -- Improvement of reactor core characteristics 
  -- Highly reliable safety setup for the heat of decay 
removal 
system 
  -- Equipment integration such as using large capacity 
immersion electromagnetic pumps 
  -- High performing fuel 
  -- Elimination of secondary sodium system 
  -- Shock proofing 
  Therefore, hereafter, as in the past, under the countries' 
combined drive for developmental projects, it is important the 
government and the people follow each others assigned tasks and 
coordinate so that an efficient technical development can be 
promoted and a cooperative posture can be maintained. It is 
vital that these efforts be continued into the future.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation 
(PNC) constructed the Tokai Vitrification Facility (TVF) to 
vitrify high-level liquid waste (HLLW) originating from PNC's 
Tokai Reprocessing Plant into borosilicate glass, which is 
stably stored and an easily handled form, with the vitrification 
technology developed by PNC. PNC is now performing cold-test 
operations of TVF using simulated liquid waste. That HLLW 
treatment is an indispensable basic technology in nuclear fuel 
cycle, and IHI has participated in the vitrification development 
program including the remote handling technology under the 
leadership of PNC since 1979. IHI received the order to 
construct TVF in 1988, started manufacturing in June of the same 
year, and successfully completed and delivered the facility to 
PNC in April 1992. 
  This paper introduces the outline of TVF and describes IHI's 
activities during construction including the design and R&amp;D. 
  The vitrification systems of TVF and related technologies 
have been adopted for the vitrification facility of the first 
Japanese commercial reprocessing plant in Shimokita, Aomori 
prefecture, and design work is now being carried out. 
<H5>  2. Specific Features of the Facility </H5>
  TVF is the first HLLW vitrification facility in Japan. 
Specific features of the facility are as follows. 
  1. Remote maintenance system 
  Contrary to the practice common in chemical plants, a large 
part of equipment in the high-level liquid waste facility is 
installed in shielded cells, thus requiring maintenance using 
remote operation. 
  The system is characterized as follows. 
  (1) Large-size integrated cell 
  Aiming at reducing the total space required, and the number 
of remote maintenance handling equipments required for each cell 
as much as possible, a large-size integrated cell (27 meters 
long, 12 meters wide and 13 meters high) is adopted rather than 
a large number of small-size distributed cells. 
  (2) Racks for grouping equipment in the cell 
  To realize effective use of in-cell space, in view of remote 
maintenance, a variety of equipment is grouped into modules to 
be placed on racks. Depending on maintenance frequency, 
equipment is respectively predetermined for maintenance on a 
rack basis or a unit basis. The size and weight of one (1) rack 
module is about 3 meters long, 3 meters wide, 6.5 meters high 
and 15 tons. 
  2. Remote handling equipment 
  In the vitrification cell, two-arm manipulators, cranes and 
ITV (Industrial Television) system for monitoring are installed 
as remote handling equipment for operation and maintenance. 
Manipulation is performed from the control room through a 
television system. This equipment (cranes and manipulators) is 
also designed to be remotely maintained themselves by each other. 
  3. Low flow ventilation system 
  The Low Flow Ventilation System (LFV) is adopted for 
ventilating of vitrification cell. In this system, the in-cell 
air is ventilated once a day and the ventilation air is 
processed through the off-gas treatment facility of the 
vitrification process. This system reduces the amount of 
radioactive material discharged when the cell is contaminated. 
Several coolers are also installed in the cell, in order to 
control the in-cell temperature. 
  4. Process control 
  The Direct Digital Control system is adopted to control and 
monitor the process, as well as the sequence control of 
auxiliary equipments. Conventional monitoring and control panes 
with aseismic design are also installed to back up monitoring 
and control of equipment at the moment of an earthquake. 
<H5>  3. Outline of the Facility </H5>
  3.1 Process capacity of the facility 
  High-level liquid waste generated in the reprocessing of one 
(1) ton of spent fuel is processed into one (1) vitrified waste 
package of 110 kg. 
  3.2 Building of the facility 
  TVF consists of a vitrification development building, an 
administration building and a stack close to vitrification 
development building. A general view of the facility is shown in 
Figure 1 [photo not reproduced], and an aerial view of the 
interior of the vitrification cell is shown in Figure 2 [not 
reproduced].

  Main processes and equipment are arranged in the underground 
area of the vitrification development building, and various 
operation support facilities such as analysis, utility, 
radiation control, process control are arranged aboveground. In 
the administration building, utilities such as emergency 
electric generator and steam supplying equipment are installed 
on the first floor, and the second through fourth floors are 
used as offices. The stack discharges ventilated air from 
processes of the facility and building. 
<H5>  4. Outline of Processes </H5>
  Figure 3 [not reproduced] shows a block flow diagram of the 
vitrification process. 
  (1) Receiving process 
  HLLW stored in the HLLW-tank of the Tokai reprocessing plant 
is transferred to the receiving-tank in the vitrification cell 
through piping. The composition of HLLW is analyzed in the tank 
to determine the quantity of reagents to be added and 
concentration ratio. 
  (2) Pre-treatment process 
  Adjustment of composition by reagents addition and 
concentration of HLLW is performed as necessary, and the liquid 
wastes is fed continuously to the glass melting process. 
  (3) Glass melting process 
  Evaporation, calcination, and glassmelting of supplied 
liquid 
waste with glass material, are performed continuously in the 
melter. The molten glass is poured into the stainless steel 
canister. Figure 4 [photo not reproduced] shows a front view of 
the melter. 
  (4) Vitrified waste (vitrified package) handling process 
  The vitrified waste is sealed with a cap by the automatic 
welding machine after natural cooling in the cell. The vitrified 
waste is de-contaminated, and then inspected about surface 
contamination, configuration, appearance, etc. 
  (5) Liquid waste treatment process 
  The secondary liquid waste generated from each process is 
concentrated in the evaporation system. Condensed water through 
evaporating separation is transferred to the Tokai reprocessing 
plant. Concentrated liquid is returned to the receiving process 
of the facility and mixed with HLLW. 
  (6) Off-gas treatment process 
  Off-gas generated from each process is washed, adsorbed, 
filtrated in the vitrification cell, and is transferred to the 
off-gas treatment room, where the remained radioactive material 
is removed. The exhaust gas is discharged through the stack with 
being continuous monitoring. 
  (7) Vitrified waste storage process 
  The vitrified wastes are transferred to the storage cell and 
stored in the pit. 
<H5>  5. Main Process Equipment </H5>
  Main equipments of the vitrification process, including the 
melter, have been technically developed under the leadership of 
PNC with cooperation of the IHI Research Institute and other 
Divisions. Main components are as follows: 
  5.1 Melter 
  A Liquid Fed Joule-Heated Ceramic Melter (LFCM) system is 
adopted for the glass melting system. In this system, the glass 
is heated and melted directly through alternating electric 
current. The melter is constructed with refractory ceramic 
materials, covered with a stainless steel casing. 
  Specific features of the LFCM system are as follows: 
  1. Calcination and melting of liquid waste can be processed 
simultaneously, and that makes the process simple. 
  2. Uniform melting of glass under high temperatures makes a 
good quality of vitrified wastes. 
  3. The use of ceramic material and heat resisting alloy 
makes 
a long service life. 
  5.2 Off-gas treatment equipment/Liquid waste treatment 
equipment 
  (1) Wet-system for off-gas treatment is selected on the base 
of an evaluation of various equipment's performance and mock-up 
tests. 
  (2) The treatment system of volatile ruthenium generated 
from 
HLLW at high temperatures in the melter is developed after a 
behavior test and a collection test of radioactive elements. 
  (3) Continuously constant feeding of HLLW is the fundamental 
factor for quality control of vitrified waste. The two-stage 
air-lift pump feeding system is adopted. 
  5.3 Vitrified waste handling and storage equipment 
  (1) A welding machine has been developed for the cap welding 
of the vitrified package. In this machine welding operation and 
preparations such as cleaning and torch positioning are 
automatically performed. In addition to this, the machine is 
designed to allow remote maintenance. 
  (2) Aseismic performance and heat-removing characteristics 
of 
the vitrified waste storage facility have been confirmed with 
full-size test, and the results are reflected to the facility. 
<H5>  6. Remote Maintenance Design </H5>
  HLLW is such a high level of radioactivity that operators 
are 
not allowed to enter the treatment area for operation and 
maintenance. Therefore, a completely remote handling system is 
adopted for the vitrification cell to reduce radiation doses of 
operators and to increase the availability of the facility. 
Layout in the vitrification cell, performance of remote handling 
equipment, and the structure of the in-cell component are 
important factors for the design of remote maintenance. 
  6.1 Layout on in-cell component 
  In the vitrification cell, two lines of rack modules are 
arranged on both sides of the walls, and the transfer and 
maintenance area is prepared between the two rack lines at the 
center. Trial fabrication and mock-up tests for the in-cell 
component have been performed, and the results are reflected to 
the actual facility. 
  (1) Arrangement plan in the cell 
  The arrangement in the cell is designed to ensure required 
space for remote maintenance (space for approach of remote 
handling equipment, for temporary replacement, for tools, for 
observation with ITV, etc.), as well as to ensure that the 
remote handling equipment does not interfere with each other. 
  (2) Equipment arrangement in rack 
  Piping and vessels in racks are considered to be maintenance 
free or to be replaced in the whole rack. The equipment required 
for periodic replacement are designed to be remotely exchanged 
individually. Therefore, remote piping connector connecting 
in-the-rack equipments are arranged to obtain accessibility of 
crane and two-arm manipulator from the front of the rack. Racks 
including piping, vessel, were completely fabricated at IHI 
works, then delivered to the site. Figure 5 [photos not 
reproduced] shows a typical rack installation at the site. 
  (3) Penetration plug 
  In the shielding wall of the vitrification cell, the 
exchangeable penetration plugs for piping with remote connectors 
are adopted for the future changes of the process. 
  Cables in the vitrification cell are connected to the 
outside 
through exchangeable penetration plugs. Each cable inside the 
cell is also individually replaced by applying a remote cable 
connector. A small remote cable connector has been developed to 
improve remote maintainability. 
  6.2 Remote handling equipment 
  Remote maintenance at the vitrification cell is carried out 
by the operation cranes and two-arm manipulators through ITV 
monitoring. This system is different from the conventional 
maintenance method by the operation of a master-slave 
manipulator observing through shielded windows. 
  (1) ITV system 
  In case of remote maintenance using ITV system, the operator 
should have the accurate information of the location of the 
component and the remote handling equipment. Considering close 
communication between the operator of several ITV cameras and 
the operator of the two-arm manipulator watching display of TV, 
a suitable layout for the remote operation area in the control 
room is designed. Several ITV cameras are installed on walls on 
the cranes, and on the two-arm manipulators in vitrification 
cell, to monitor the whole cell. Two sets of high-definition TV 
are also adopted in an ITV system to improve monitoring. 
Radiation-hardness of ITV cameras has been verified through PNC 
R&amp;D. 
  (2) Two-arm manipulator 
  Two units of two-arm manipulators are installed. If one 
fails, the other can be used for remotely maintaining the failed 
one. The two-arm manipulator has lifting capacity up to 15 kg by 
one (1) arm, seven modes of action, and bilateral functions. The 
two-arm manipulator is mounted on the bridge and enables the 
wide range of operations inside the cell. 
<H5>  7. On Site Test </H5>
  7.1 Remote maintenance test 
  A remote maintenance operability was pre-studied during the 
design stage using a 1/10 scale model. A preliminary remote 
maintenance test was performed on the scrubber rack, the 
representative rack, and the melter rack at the mock-up test 
facility of PNC, to confirm maintainability and procedure of 
operations. Test results are reflected to all the other racks 
and components. A remote maintenance test has been finally 
carried out as on site test in the cell. Figure 6 [photos not 
reproduced] shows the remote operation test. 
  7.2 Process operation test 
  Process operation tests and unit tests have been carried out 
using water and compressed air. Then a performance test of the 
vitrification has been carried out using simulated liquid waste. 
<H5>  8. Conclusion </H5>
  We are pleased to complete successfully the construction and 
test run of TVF. New concepts and technology have been verified 
through the construction and test run of TVF. 
  We hope that the PNC will progress the test run of TVF in 
satisfactory. [sentence as published] We also intend to apply 
these experiences for future plant construction and other fields.

  [Text] Next fiscal year the Energy Agency will begin 
"technical confirmation tests of systems for recycling the waste 
resulting from the dismantling of nuclear reactors used for 
generating electrical power," the objective of which is to 
accelerate the development of technology to accompany measures 
for shutting down nuclear power plants. The Energy Agency is now 
moving ahead with "technical confirmation tests of equipment for 
shutting down reactors," to expand the development of 
dismantling technology, and "surveys of reactor shutdown 
technology," to investigate waste disposal measures and the 
legal system. In the steps that will be taken next time, reactor 
shutdown measures will be carried out in three steps. 
  The basic policy in shutting down nuclear power plant 
facilities is to seal off the facilities for a fixed period of 
time, then to dismantle and remove them. The concrete scheduling 
of such steps will be after the year 2000 because nuclear power 
plants are normally in use for 30 to 40 years. 
  From now on the important thing is to work toward harmony 
with local societies based on a premise of guaranteed safety. 
Then, while promoting further technological sophistication, 
there must be systems of safety regulations and measures for the 
disposal of the resulting waste, as well as studies from a 
social perspective that take into consideration the local people. 
  The Energy Agency is now concerned about the Tokai nuclear 
power plant (166,000 kW; in operation since 1966), which is 
expected to be shut down in the near future. At the same time, 
the agency is heading toward providing governmental guidance so 
that the government and private sector will cooperate in studies 
for the purpose of formulating concrete procedures for shutting 
down reactors. While the agency will continue to implement 
conventional confirmation tests and technical surveys on reactor 
shutdown measures, it will also begin the development of 
technology for recycling the waste resulting from dismantling a 
reactor.

  [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. 
(PNC) announced that on 1 October it will resume the production 
of plutonium fuel for the Monju FBR. Fuel production had been 
suspended since June because of trouble at the fuel production 
facility. To bake and harden the fuel pellets, the PNC will use 
a spare electric furnace that was recently set up in place of 
the production-line-style electric furnace that broke down. The 
plan is for the fuel production to end by next February, and for 
the Monju to reach criticality (a state in which the nuclear 
fission reaction occurs continuously) by next spring. Fuel 
loading is to begin around the middle of this month. For the 
initial loading 198 fuel bodies are needed, but now there are 
only 160.

  [Text] The danger of cracking in a pressurized water 
reactor vessel due to sudden cooling has been pointed out. 
However, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries compiled test results 
showing that at the present time there is no such worry about 
Japan's young reactors. It is thought that a reactor vessel will 
be damaged by the weakening of the vessel walls as the reactor 
gets older, and in the U.S. there is the argument that such 
damage is linked to the age of the reactor. 
  When a reactor vessel is used for a long time, it is known 
that the materials weaken because of the vessel's exposure to 
the neutrons resulting from the nuclear fission within. If the 
emergency reactor core cooling unit goes into operation in an 
old pressurized water reactor, there is the danger of the vessel 
cracking because of the sudden temperature change. Although that 
sort of brittleness breakdown has never yet occurred, there are 
indications that the danger of breakdown increases when the 
deterioration of the vessel due to its age is added to poor 
conditions such as the presence of small cracks. 
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Takasago Laboratory (Takasago 
City, Hyogo Prefecture) produced simulation test materials that 
behave the same as actual reactor vessel materials with respect 
to the force applied to the vessel because of cooling, the 
deterioration of the vessel materials due to neutron 
irradiation, and the existence of cracks. The researchers then 
verified what happens during cooling under a variety of 
temperature conditions. 
  The results of the tests showed that, even in a reactor 
vessel that has been used for 40 years, the destructive force 
resulting from thermal shock would not exceed the strength of 
the materials. The laboratory's judgment is that that will not 
occur in Japan's reactors, which have been in operation for as 
long as 20 years. 
  The tests, which have been carried out at Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries' Takasago Laboratory since 1983, were commissioned by 
the Electrical Power Facilities Technology Inspection 
Association, a non-profit corporation that is an auxiliary 
corporation of MITI.

  [Text] The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI), 
in cooperation with Nagoya University, synthesized and separated 
a new isotope, praseodymium-127 (Pr: a rare-earth element whose 
atomic number is 59). The researchers ascertained the half-life 
and at the same time confirmed that gamma rays are emitted by 
the isotope. This is the latest of the results obtained at the 
ion irradiation research facility (TIARA) that was established 
in 1991 at JAERI's Takasaki Laboratory. Because the Pr-127 
isotope has 14 fewer neutrons than the naturally occurring 
stable Pr-141 isotope and is very unstable, its existence was 
difficult to confirm and its half-life was unknown until now. 
  The researchers formed Pr-127 in a reaction with argon-36 
(Ar-36) and molybdenum-94 (Mo-94), then, after separating the 
isotope with an on-line isotope separator (ISOL), confirmed its 
existence by measuring gamma-ray and other radiation. 
  The researchers used a strong Ar-36 beam, which was 
generated 
with the TIARA's AVF cyclotron, in a synthesizing nuclear 
reaction with Mo-94 to form Pr-127. Next, they isolated only 
three types of Pr-127 from the isotopes produced, and then 
measured the Pr isotopes, which became extinct within seconds. 
The results of the analyses showed that the half-life of Pr-127 
is 7.7 +/- 0.6 seconds. 
  Isotopes are the components of space from which the 
structure 
of matter originates, and studying the properties of isotopes is 
useful in understanding the process by which the elements are 
formed. Because of that there is vigorous research on isotopes 
in the advanced countries, and, in the 80 years since the 
discovery of isotopes, one thousand and several hundred isotopes 
have been confirmed. In 1989 JAERI discovered a new isotope of 
lanthanum (La-121). After that JAERI used the newly set up AVF 
cyclotron in research on Pr isotopes. Now JAERI plans to search 
for Pr-125, which has even fewer neutrons than Pr-127 and is 
expected to have an even shorter half-life.

  [Text] The decision was made to keep the Kyoto University's 
KUR research reactor (thermal output, 5,000 kW; located in 
Kumatori-machi, Osaka-fu) in operation. The Science Council 
(chairman, Ken'ichi Fukui), an MOE advisory organ, compiled a 
report on university research reactors confirming that such 
reactors would continue to be used. The debate about keeping the 
reactors going, which included the issues of whether 
universities should have their own reactors for research or 
whether they should use JAERI's reactors, and what sort of 
atomic energy research universities should do, concluded in the 
decision to continue along the same route as in the past. 
  The Science Council's report is entitled "About How Nuclear 
Reactors for University Research Should Be." In that report the 
Science Council notes the importance of the KUR "as a reactor 
with which significant scientific research may be carried out in 
the future," and positively assesses the KUR's role from the 
viewpoint of scientific research and the cultivation of talented 
researchers. The report approves the continued use of the KUR 
with certain conditions attached, one of which is that the 
research to be carried out with the reactor matches the 
characteristics of the facility. 
  However, in regard to how the KUR will be handled from now 
on, the report emphasizes that maintenance, such as 
"preventative maintenance of auxiliary facilities that is 
important for safety ensurance," is needed to guarantee the 
safety and reliability of the reactor. In addition, there are 
conditions attached to organizational management methods, e.g., 
every few years the reactor would be evaluated on its joint use 
and the state of research implementation. 
  With that, Kyoto University will begin to formulate a new 
research plan based on the contents of the report. After the new 
plan is explained to groups such as the Osaka-fu Nuclear Reactor 
Problems Council and the Kumatori-machi Nuclear Power Problems 
and Countermeasures Conference, the organizational changes based 
on the new plan will be incorporated into the FY95 rough 
[budget] requests. 
  The KUR is the only university-instituted megawatt-class 
reactor, and, as a joint-use research institute for all of 
Japan's universities since first criticality in 1964, over 8,000 
researchers have been using the reactor in areas such as 
radiation medicine and materials experiments that utilize the 
neutrons produced by nuclear fission. In 1976 a plan to 
construct a second reactor surfaced because of the KUR's 
deterioration. Due to the local residents' opposition, however, 
the plan was withdrawn in 1990, and the problem of whether or 
not to shut the KUR down has been pending. 
  On the other hand, because of the refurbishing of JAERI's 
JRR-3 research reactor (thermal output, 20,000 kW; in 
Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture), the JRR-3 can now be used for 
advanced research, and the necessity of "a university-owned 
nuclear reactor" is being questioned. Given such a situation, 
since 1990 the Science Council has been debating about whether 
to maintain the KUR or to shut it down.

  [Text] MITI has moved toward the realization of the "Lunar 
Resource Development Project" (provisional name), which is an 
effort to get helium-3, a nuclear fusion fuel, from the surface 
of the moon and bring it back to earth. The project involves 
setting up a government-private research cooperative in FY95, 
then, when the 21st century begins, to begin actual resource 
probing of the moon's surface. To prepare for the establishment 
of the research cooperative, the "Forum on Lunar Resources" will 
begin this month. Helium-3, which gives off hardly any 
radioactivity, is said to be the ideal fuel for nuclear fusion. 
Succeeding in putting helium-3 into practical use could solve 
the world's resource problems for the next several centuries. 
MITI has also asked NASA, a U.S. organization that has shown 
results in space development, and other groups to join in the 
project. The idea is for the project to evolve into the first 
international space development project led by Japan. 
  In addition to the AIST Geological Survey of Japan and the 
AIST National Institute for Resources and Environment, about 20 
companies, including Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Nissan Motors, 
and Hitachi, Ltd., will participate in the "Forum on Lunar 
Resources." The forum will investigate important development 
topics such as 1) how to separate and remove helium-3 from moon 
sand, 2) technology for transporting the helium-3 from the moon 
to the earth, 3) the development of lunar base camps and lunar 
vehicles, and 4) problems over rights of possession in the case 
where base camps are set up. 
  The government-private research cooperative will begin 
research on the critical technologies in FY95, and will launch a 
probe rocket to the moon when the 21st century begins. The goal 
is to realize a lunar resource gathering system that will convey 
helium-3 from the lunar base camps to earth in the 2020s. 
  Nuclear fusion using helium-3 as fuel is seen as a promising 
source of energy that has markedly less radioactivity than 
conventional reactions using tritium as a fuel. 
  Trial calculations show that burning several tens of tons 
per 
year of helium-3 in nuclear fusion would furnish enough 
electrical power for the entire world in the 21st century. 
Although there is no helium-3 on earth, millions of tons of it 
are presumed to be on the moon's surface. 
  There are also funding and technical issues, such as the 
enormous development costs and making fusion reactors practical. 
MITI, however, says that if the concept is realized there are 
high possibilities that it will solve energy and environmental 
problems and that it will lead to the uncovering of a tremendous 
space business. 
<H5>  Helium-3 </H5>
  Helium-3 exists in collections of high-energy particles that 
are carried away from the sun (the solar wind). Because the 
solar wind falls directly on the moon's surface, where there is 
no air, helium-3 is said to be abundant in the moon's sand and 
rocks. Even when helium-3 undergoes nuclear fusion with tritium, 
most of the energy is taken out in the form of protons. 
Therefore, there is little effect due to radioactivity on the 
surroundings.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) developed and will 
embark upon the commercialization of a self-advancing ultrasonic 
flaw-detecting robot that looks for cracks in a nuclear reactor 
vessel. The robot can reduce the time needed for a periodic 
inspection of the reactor vessel to less than one-half the time 
needed with conventional devices, and it can lessen the danger 
of workers being exposed to radiation. In addition to talking 
business with Japanese electric power companies, MHI also plans 
to sell the robot in Europe, the U.S., Taiwan, and Korea, where 
there are increasing demands for safety guarantees because of 
deterioration in reactor vessels. 
  The product name of this device is "advanced reactor vessel 
ultrasonic crack-detecting device (A-UT machine)." When the 
robot is submerged in the cavity of a reactor vessel that is 
filled with cooling water, it automatically sticks to the wall 
of the reactor vessel and then crawls around until it finds a 
crack. This is the first time in the world that a water-swimming 
crack-detecting robot has been made practical. Using the new 
device shortens the inspection time by nine days, and the job 
can be done by seven or eight workers. 
  Crack-detecting devices in the past were produced as 
auxiliary parts of a nuclear reactor and had to be assembled and 
then disassembled for every inspection. They were elaborate 
contrivances, such as the probe boards that ascended and 
descended a main column inside the reactor vessel. Inspections 
took as long as 20 days and required 15 workers. 
  The new robot has a six-axis manipulator that extends from 
the turtle-shell-shaped main body. The manipulator is rotary 
driven in six places, so the probe at the end of the manipulator 
can reach anywhere in the reactor vessel. Information obtained 
from the probe is sent from the main body's UT (ultrasonic 
testing) signal oscillator through optical fiber to the 
ultrasonic crack detector then is processed by a data-gathering 
and analysis unit. 
  The robot uses a propeller-type thruster to move through the 
water. It advances along the reactor vessel wall like a 
four-wheel-steering (4WS), four-wheel-drive (4WD) car. The 
underside of the main body of the robot is furnished with a 
fastening plate to fix the machine to the surface of the vessel 
wall. 
  To determine the A-UT's position, "position ranging devices" 
affixed in three places around the reactor vessel emit argon 
laser beams and home in on the machine to measure its distance. 
The setup is such that the A-UT body "target" is always across 
from a position ranging device and reflects the laser light. 
  The robot weighs 300 kg, and the main body without the 
manipulator is 1.5 m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  in area. Although the price of 
the robot has not yet been announced, MHI says "100-million-yen 
units." Demand in Japan is expected to be limited to just a few 
robots, but in France and other countries there is big demand 
for automated inspection of mainly pressurized water reactors. 
Before selling the new robot MHI will make reliability 
improvements, etc., of the prototype that was completed in 1991.

  [Text] In February, Satsuki Eda, a representative of the 
Social Democratic Federation who once called for a "five-year 
moratorium" and emphasized "doing away with nuclear power," 
assumed the post of Director General of the Science and 
Technology Agency in the Hosokawa coalition cabinet. While 
Director General Eda stresses the continuation of government 
policies on nuclear power, he has also opened the lines of 
communications in an effort to clarify the differences with the 
policies of the Liberal Democartic administration. Director 
General Eda gives some a sense of impending reform, but given 
that he is simply one who tries to please everybody, the trust 
of neither the pro-nuclear nor anti-nuclear sides will be 
gained. The crucial time is from now on. 
  Soon after Director General Eda assumed his cabinet position 
he opened the door for direct dialog with anti-nuclear-power 
groups. Nisaburo Takagi of the Nuclear Power Data and 
Information Office said, "Up until now, even if they met the 
Director General, all they ever did was hand over a list of 
demands. Any exchange of ideas was impossible." 
  On 20 September Miyako Oshita, a single representative of a 
nation-wide anti-nuclear group called the Plutonium Action 
Network, met with Director General Eda. Her face looked hopeful 
when she said, "It was the first time to speak with the STA 
Director General, and he made a definite promise to continue 
dialog in the future." 
  That the pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear factions joined hands 
for the first time and co-sponsored a symposium entitled "Why 
Plutonium Now?" on 25 September, was also on the line extending 
out of the route "from confrontation to dialog." After 
experiencing the pursuit of nuclear energy policies during the 
LDP administration, there appears to be a strong perception that 
"those of the anti-nuclear faction are also important 
associates" (Director General Eda's words). 
  On the other hand, in contrast to that situation, it is also 
a fact that within the STA there is the following criticism: 
"Government policies are decided through democratic procedures. 
Formally lending an ear to the anti-nuclear faction will make 
administration sluggish." Then the head of a division involved 
with nuclear power divulged the following: "After about 
November, when the nuclear power administration's study will end 
one pass, people in the STA will probably be more nervous. From 
now on we wonder what sort of orders will come from the Director 
General." 
  Nevertheless, even if the dialog route is remarkable, the 
government's policy of atomic energy promotion and the 
establishment of a nuclear fuel cycle aimed at the effective use 
of plutonium is no change from that of the LDP administration. 
That is because the basis for the existence of the Hosokawa 
cabinet lies in the "succession of the previous administration's 
policies" based on an agreement among the eight coalition 
parties. 
  Director General Eda himself hinted about the change of 
direction in an interview last August: "The Social Democratic 
Federation's predecessor, the Social Citizen's Federation, had 
been seeking a five-year moratorium on nuclear power. But, when 
the basic doctrine of supporting the administration was proposed 
three years ago, those words disappeared." 
  In the 5 October meeting of the Lower House Budget Committee 
Director General Eda made a fairly positive observation: "The 
effective use of plutonium is a choice that resource-poor Japan 
should take." 
  As the head of the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan, 
Director General Eda inherits the promotion of atomic energy for 
electrical power generation, but he also listens to the voice of 
the opposing forces. How will he deal with the assertions of the 
two sides? Director General Eda will continue walking a 
tightrope.

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroo Yasue, General Manager, Technical </F>
Development Department, Technology Research Association for 
Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell Power Generation System] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  MCFC power generation is expected to meet the global 
environment in the 21st century due to its higher electric power 
generation efficiency and smaller SO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  and 
NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions. Many efforts have been made for R&amp;D 
on MCFC power generation system since the early 1980s in the 
United States of America, Japan and Europe. 
  The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in 
the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has 
organized a national project (Moonlight Project) aiming for new 
energy systems, in which MCFC project has been promoted in 
cooperation with New Energy and Industrial Technology 
Development Organization (NEDO) and their contractors. MCFC 
Research Association was established in February 1988 to 
accelerate the R&amp;D on stack operation, plant system and 
equipment, coal gasification combined system, and new materials. 
  At present, a second-stage plan targeting the development of 
a 1000kW class pilot plant is being conducted. In order to 
achieve this target, 100kW class stacks by external reforming 
type cells, peripheral equipment and system control technology 
are to be developed and assessed by FY93. Then, the fabrication 
of the 1000kW pilot plant will immediately start and a 
demonstration test will be completed by FY97. 
  The current status of R&amp;D for MCFC power generation 
system 
are presented here. 
<H5>  1. MCFC Power Generation System </H5>
  A basic power generation system of LNG fueled-MCFC is 
illustrated in Figure 1. The system consists mainly of reformer, 
stack, AC/DC converter, gas recycle blower (high temperature 
blower), and heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-001LC-09A>           Figure 1. Basic System of MCFC Power Generation </FIG>




  A gas mixture of LNG and steam is fed at 800&deg;C and 3ata 
to the refomer tube packed with Ni catalyst on which reforming 
reactions take place to form hydrogen rich gas. The resulting 
gas is introduced to the anode and hydrogen reacts with 
carbonate ion from cathode through electrolyte to generate 
electricity. The anode exhaust gas is to the reformer and is 
catalytically combusted to produce heat needed for endothermic 
reforming reactions. The combusted gas containing carbon dioxide 
is fed to the cathode. The cathode exhaust is recycled by the 
high temperature blower to recover heat produced in power 
generation. Energy in the cathode exhaust from the recycle line 
is recovered by the turbine compressor and HRSG. Compressed air 
by the compressor is fed to the cathode and oxygen reacts with 
carbon dioxide and electron from anode to form carbonate ion. 
Steam from HRSG is mixed with LNG at the inlet of the reformer. 
<H3>  2. Demonstration Tests at Akagi Research Laboratory (Akagi 
Stack and System Square) </H3>
  Akagi 3S was constructed in October 1990 by MCFC Research 
Association to test 100kW stacks and 1,000kW plant equipment, 
for example, reformer, high temperature blower, turbine 
compressor, and HRSG by this September. 
<H5>  2.1 100kW Class Stack Operation Tests </H5>
  NEDO is developing two 100kW-class MCFC stacks (multiple 
large capacity type and rectangular large capacity type). 
  The test is intended for the confirmation of the performance 
of these stacks. The target values of 100kW stacks are initial 
cell voltage of 0.8V at 150mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and decay rate of 
less than 1&percnt;/1000 hours. 
  Taking the test results into consideration, four 250kW fuel 
cell stacks will be designed and manufactured as the main 
component of the pilot plant. 
<H5>  2.2 1000kW Class Fuel Processing Subsystem Tests </H5>
  The tests are aimed at confirming the performance of the two 
newly developed reformers, namely: heat exchanger type and 
two-stage catalytic combustion type (Figure 2). These reformers 
produce hydrogen rich gas to be supplied to fuel cell anode. 
Heat for processing reaction is obtained by the catalytic 
combustion of low calorie anode exhaust gas. The tests with full 
scale (1000kW) capacity are now proceeding. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-001LC-10A>           Figure 2. Outline of Two Types of Reformer </FIG>




  The heat exchanger type consists of catalytic combuster to 
produce 1200&deg;C gas and reformer tubes. 
  The anode exhaust is introduced to the first combuster and 
combusted on a Pd/Al&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; -ZrO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
catalyst to produce a gas of 1000&deg;C followed by secondary 
combustion on thermally conductive SiC. A reforming catalyst of 
0.24m&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt;  are packed in 6 reformer tubes of 165mm in 
diameter. In case of the 1000kW plant, LNG of 141kg/h is fed at 
S/C of 3 and hydrogen rich gas of 1154Nm&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt; /h is 
produced. 
  The two-stage catalytic combustion type consists of 16 
reformer tubes of 165mm in diameter which are directly contact 
with two combustion catalyst bed. The tube is a dual column type 
and contains a reforming catalyst of 0.5m&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt; . The 
configuration of the combustion catalyst bed was simulated from 
physical and basic experimental data and verified by a 100kW 
test plant. The start up time within 3.5hrs and NOx emission of 
4ppm at steady state have been confirmed. 
<H5>  2.3 1000kW Class Stack Peripheral System Tests </H5>
  The installation of the test apparatus was finished in 
August 
1993. 
  The performance of the newly developed high temperature 
blower and cell differential pressure control will be tested. A 
part of the control equipment and the high temperature blower 
are completely manufactured. 
  Demonstration tests are intended to confirm: (1) optimum 
differential pressure control method between the anode and the 
cathode, (2) heat resistance and performance characteristics of 
the high temperature blower, etc. 
<H5>  2.4 1000kW Class Heat Recovery System Tests </H5>
  The full scale test facilities were constructed in August 
1993. 
  Demonstration tests will be performed on the turbine 
compressor for producing compressed air by means of the kinetic 
energy of the cathode outlet gas and HRSG for producing the 
steam for fuel processing reaction with recovered heat of the 
turbine outlet gas. 
  Demonstration tests are intended to confirm: 
  (1) performance characteristics and emergency shutdown 
characteristics of the turbine compressor, etc. 
  (2) heat conducting characteristics, load response and 
startup/shutdown characteristics of HRSG. 
<H5>  Afterward </H5>
  The development and demonstration of the 1000kW class pilot 
plant as the ultimate target of the phase-II R&amp;D project of 
the 
MCFC power generation system will be started soon based on the 
interim report of the Evaluation Subcommittee of the Energy 
Conservation Technology Development Committee in the Industrial 
Technology Council, an advisory organ for the Minister of 
International Trade and Industry. 
  In order to enhance our activities for the construction of 
the pilot plant, the research and development including fuel 
cell stacks development was unified to our association and the 
members from electric utilities was newly joined our association 
in May 1993.

Development Division, the Central Electric Power Council] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Technological Development in Electric Power Enterprises </H5>
  The thinking that economic development, stabilized energy 
supply and the protection of environment are inseparable is 
spreading in many sectors. The problem of environment is being 
grasped from a global standpoint comprising the conservation of 
natural resources. The significance of the environment is being 
recognized in all aspects of social life. 
  In the meantime, the demand and supply of energy are tending 
to increase in long-term prospects although accurate prediction 
is rendered difficult due to the uncertain behavior of economies 
under recession and the change of industrial structures. The 
electric utility enterprises, which will play a vital role in 
the future supply of electric power, are working for the 
development of new electric power sources and expanded exchange 
of electric power among electric companies of different regions. 
  The Central Electric Power Council, meanwhile, has 
enumerated 
as important subjects of technological development technology 
for protecting the environment, nuclear power generation 
technology, coal thermal power generation technology, power 
transmission network technology and technology for effective 
energy utilization and new energy in its ``Electric Power 
Technology Development Program.'' Fuel cell power generation is 
defined as one of the main themes of the above-mentioned 
``technology for effective energy utilization and new energy'' 
to be pursued hereafter by electric power companies. 
  Incidentally, the costs for promoting technological 
development during FY 1993 are estimated at about &yen;218,200 
million divided among 10 electric power companies, Electric 
Power Development Co., Ltd., the Japan Atomic Power Co. and the 
Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (Figure 1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-001LC-12A>           Figure 1. Breakdown of R&amp;D Budget in FY 1993 </FIG>




<H5>  2. Development and Introduction of Fuel Cells </H5>
  The electric power industry in Japan has been consistently 
pursuing the development and introduction of fuel cells from the 
standpoint of effective utilization of energy and protection of 
the global environment. Following is an outline of research and 
development efforts by electric utility companies. 
<H5>  (1) Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFC) </H5>
  Phosphoric acid fuel cells are moving from the stage of 
basic 
development to that of practical applications. R&amp;D have been 
conducted incessantly in the electric power industry for the 
past 10 years (Table 1).

*TPS = Thermal Power Station 


  The electric power industry formulated in 1991 the New 
Energy 
Introduction Project for promoting the practical application of 
new energy including solar photovoltaic power and wind power 
with a target of generating more than 1 million kW of new energy 
by the year 2000. As for fuel cells, the industry plans to 
introduce about 37 units centering on small-capacity models 
(50-200kW) throughout the country for the time being for 
collecting basic data on operation, maintenance and heat 
utilization and thereby to expedite their early commercial 
application. 
  Based on this program, Shikoku Electric Power Co., Inc., the 
Hokuriku Electric Power Co., Inc., Chubu Electric Power Co., 
Inc. and Tohoku Electric Power Co., Inc. started operation 
research in FY92, giving a fresh impetus to the progress of the 
project. 
  Furthermore, Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. and Central 
Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, under contract 
with the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, installed on 
Rokko Island, Kobe, an on-site fuel cell unit consisting of 
fourteen 50-kW units and one 200-kW unit with total output of 
900-kW combined with solar photovoltaic and wind power 
generation systems. Research is directed at the solution of 
technical problems during the linkage of dispersed-type power 
sources with the power grid. 
  As for large-capacity units, Tokyo Electric Power Co., Inc. 
(TEPCO) constructed the world's largest 11,000-kW class plant on 
the premises of Goi Thermal Power Station based on the technical 
data of the operation research conducted with a 4,500-kW pilot 
plant until 1985. The new plant started operation in 1991. 
  PAFC Technology Research Association, established jointly by 
gas and electric power companies, is conducting research on the 
improvement of PAFC with subsidies provided by the Agency of 
Natural Resources and Energy. The purpose is to introduce PAFC 
power plant in practical use at an early date. The Research 
Association is developing a 5,000-kW pressurized plant and 
1,000-kW ambient pressure plant with power generation efficiency 
of over 42&percnt; and featuring low cost, high reliability and 
compactness in a six-year program from 1991 to 1996. 
  The above-mentioned 5,000-kW plant has been designed based 
on 
the operation data obtained from two 1,000-kW plants developed 
by Kansai Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power as a national 
project since 1987. New project has started after the evaluation 
of the previous data and mapping out the plan for the next step 
by the Central Electric Power Council. 
<H5>  (2) Molten Carbonate Fuel-cells (MCFC) </H5>
  Molten carbonate fuel cells are expected to be promising 
alternative power sources to thermal power plants since coal gas 
can be employed with high efficiency. The development of MCFC 
has been led by MCFC Technology Research Association in the 
framework of the New-Sunshine (former Moonlight) Project and 
centered on elementary research such as the development of 
peripheral equipment of cell stacks and reformers. Ten electric 
power companies became members of the association in May 1993 to 
take part in the development project of a 1,000-kW class pilot 
plant (external reforming type) to be started in the second half 
of this year, based on the governmental interim evaluation. In 
addition, electric power companies are conducting basic research 
and surveys separately. Kansai Electric Power and Mitsubishi 
Electric Corp. have been conducting, for example, joint 
operation research of a 100-kW class stack of indirect internal 
reforming type since May 1992. 
<H5>  (3) Solid Oxide Fuel Cells </H5>
  The development of solid oxide fuel cells in Japan is at a 
stage of elementary research for stacks with an output of 
200-1,000kW. They are ranked as promising fuel cells of the next 
generation following PAFC and MCFC. 
  The electric power industry is accumulating technical data 
through basic research and operation tests, and is also 
conducting surveys on research trends and themes in Japan and 
abroad. 
  TEPCO has been conducting joint R&amp;D with Mitsubishi 
Heavy 
Industries, Ltd. since 1986 and carried out generation tests of 
a 1-kW stack, to which Electric Power Development Co. later 
joined. Chubu Electric Power and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 
have jointly developed a 1-kW stack of monoblock layer built 
type. 
  Furthermore, Kansai Electric Power, in a joint project with 
Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Westinghouse of the U.S., has developed 
a 25-kW cell system, the largest solid oxide fuel cell unit so 
far in the world. Operation research has been conducted for this 
plant installed in the New Energy Testing Center of Kansai 
Electric on Rokko Island since April 1992. 
<H5>  3. Tasks for Practical Use of Fuel Cells </H5>
  As mentioned above, the government and the electric power 
industry are conducting research and collecting data in various 
forms for the development of fuel cells. Numerous tasks are 
still necessary before fuel cells can be practically applied and 
introduced as generation systems of electric utility enterprises. 
<H5>  (1) Higher Performance and Longer Service Life </H5>
  The performance of modern fuel cells has already attained a 
current density of 200-250mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and an output 
density of 0.13-0.16W/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  under ambient pressure and 
200-300 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and 0.15-0.22A/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; 
respectively, in pressurized state. The emphasis is expected to 
shift hereafter to longer service life and higher stability 
rather than higher output density. 
  The longest cumulative operating time so far is 18,377 hours 
(as of March 1993) achieved by a 200-kW plant made by IFC of 
America and installed in TEPCO Shibaura Square Building, Tokyo. 
The longest continuous operating time of over 4,000 hours has 
also been established. The reliability of a plant needs constant 
improvement over numerous tests. A service life of over 40,000 
hours is regarded as essential. Present research is targeted at 
this value. Improvement of catalyst performance and technology 
to prevent the loss of electrolyte are awaited to lead to target 
performance. 
<H5>  (2) Cost Reduction </H5>
  Cost is the greatest problem that should be surmounted 
before 
practical application. Cost below &yen;200,000-&yen;250,000 per 
kW is required. This corresponds to about 1/4 to 1/5 of the 
present level of cost. Cost reduction may be achieved through 
higher performance of the cells themselves, simplification and 
compactness of the plant including peripheral equipment, higher 
skill and standardization of manufacturing processes and the 
mass production effect brought about through expanded market. 
<H5>  (3) Compactness </H5>
  The installation space of the equipment is an important 
factor for practical application in Japan with its high land 
prices. Present plants tend to disregard compactness since they 
are mainly intended for research and testing. The 5,000-kW stack 
of PAFC Association occupies an installation space of about 
0.27m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; /kW. This must be reduced to 1/3 if the system 
is to be competitive with existing gas turbines and gas engines. 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  An interim report by the Demand and Supply Subcommittee of 
the Central Electric Power Council in June 1990 estimates that 
the capacity of dispersed-type power sources in the electric 
utility industry will reach 1.1 million kW (of which fuel cells 
will account for 1.05 million kW) by the end of the year 2000, 
and 5.7 million kW (5.5 million kW, ditto) by 2010. 
  Mounting interest in the global environment has also 
attracted general attention to the development and application 
of fuel cells with its potential for environmental protection 
and effective utilization of energy. 
  Under these circumstances, Japan's electric power industry 
intends to make the utmost effort for experimental introduction 
and technology development of phosphoric acid fuel cells for the 
time being. The R&amp;D of advanced-type cells such as molten 
carbonate type and solid oxide type will be stepped up at the 
same time. 
  As regards so-called new energy generation including fuel 
cells, photovoltaic generation and wind power generation, the 
electric power industry is ready to cooperate with users who own 
these facilities and to purchase the surplus power from these 
users, if desired, under certain conditions through links with 
the power grid, so as to positively promote the introduction of 
environment-friendly new energy generation.

  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Foreword </H5>
  The city gas industry is keenly interested in fuel cells as 
urban-type on-site cogeneration power source and has been 
promoting their research and development for long time from the 
standpoint of protecting the global environment and economizing 
resources. 
  Since 1972, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. and Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. have 
taken part in the Target Project, a U.S.-sponsored development 
project of on-site fuel cells for general consumers, and carried 
out the test of four PC11 units (each 12.5kW) the following 
year; inaugurating the development of fuel cells in our country. 
The gas industry later took part in consistent R&amp;D of on-site 
fuel cells in a series of projects including GRI of the United 
States, the Moonlight Project of AIST-NEDO and industrialization 
projects with domestic makers. This article is a report on the 
development and field tests of on-site phosphoric acid fuel 
cells (PAFC), which are steadily nearing completion. 
<H5>  2. Development of PAFC </H5>
  Table 1 shows the general outline of the development of 
on-site phosphoric acid fuel cells. 



<H3>  2-1. 50-kW and 100-kW Class Models (Joint Development by 
Three Gas Companies and Fuji Electric Co., Ltd.) </H3>
  The 50-kW model was made on trial as the first item in the 
merchandise development project by three gas companies. After 
the third improvement, the first trial model for mass production 
was perfected in early 1991. At present, 23 units are operating 
for evaluation tests in the facilities of four gas companies 
(Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas and Saibu Gas) and in those of 
customers. One model has already established the record for 
longest operating hours (13,000 hrs) with cumulative output of 
over 500,000kWh. Waste heat is exclusively used for producing 
hot water (60&deg;C). The first 100-kW model, developed after 
the 50-kW model, started operation in 1992. Six units have been 
installed in the facilities of Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas 
and others and the longest operating time of 4,000 hours has 
been established. Unlike the 50-kW type, half of the waste heat 
is recovered for the production of steam. A combination with the 
absorption refrigerating machine is awaited to lead to the 
realization of a more efficient cogeneration system. 
<H5>  2-2. 200-kW Models </H5>
<H3>  (1) Moonlight Project for Commercial Fuel Cells (NEDO, 
Osaka Gas, Kansai Electric Power and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.) </H3>
  The first model was installed at the Plaza Hotel, Kita-ku, 
Osaka, in July 1989 and started operation in August of the same 
year. The trial run was successfully concluded at the end of 
October 1991 with cumulative operating time of 13,038 hours (the 
longest record for domestic models). Cell deterioration was also 
kept within envisaged tolerance. 
<H5>  (2) The First Lot Units of PC25 (ONSI) </H5>
  Fifty units of this quasi-commercial model developed by ONSI 
of America are to be distributed around the world from 1992 to 
1994. Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Toho Gas are purchasing in 
succession 10 units, 10 units and one unit, respectively. Field 
tests have continued since 1992 in the facilities of customer 
companies. Nine units are operating at present with the longest 
operating time of over 6,000 hours. The heat output is 
exclusively used for the production of hot water for the 
present. It is optionally possible to produce hot water of 
90&deg;C for linking with an absorption refrigerating machine. 
<H5>  2-3. 500-kW Models (Osaka Gas and Fuji Electric) </H5>
  The development of 500-kW models was started in 1990, and a 
trial model has been installed and tested at Torishima Plant of 
Osaka Gas. Distinguishing features of the 500-kW model is that 
it is targeted at industrial uses and regional air conditioning, 
that the steam recovery ratio has been raised through low S/C, 
and that a fractional unit type package is adapted for the 
convenience of transport and installation. 
<H5>  2-4. 1,000-kW Models (NEDO and PAFC Association) </H5>
  Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas and Saibu Gas joined the 
Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell Technology Research Association (PAFC 
Association) established in April 1991 and are developing 
1,000-kW units with government subsidies. Toshiba Corp. is 
entrusted with the development. Demonstration tests are planned 
in 1995 and 1996 in the Tamachi area of Tokyo Gas. 
<H5>  3. Field Tests of PAFC </H5>
  The gas industry is stepping up the development and 
evaluation tests of on-site fuel cells in preparation for their 
early practical application. The Ministry of International Trade 
&amp; Industry inaugurated in FY 1992 subsidies for field tests 
of 
fuel cell power generation systems in parallel with solar 
photovoltaic power generation systems for expediting the 
introduction and diffusion of new power generation systems. This 
project is aimed at collection and analysis of various 
operational data under the actual conditions of fuel cells, 
thereby contributing to their diffusion. Field tests of fuel 
cells are to be conducted from FY 1992 to 1994 in more than 30 
categories by subsidizing one third of the costs involved. About 
&yen;600 million was appropriated for this purpose in the budget 
of FY 1992. 
  Gas companies took part in 15 sites of this project during 
FY 
1992. In addition, they are conducting their own field tests in 
the facilities of users. Among others, the field test at Umeda 
Center Building, Osaka, has achieved a continuous operating time 
of 4,786 hours and the world record is being renewed steadily. 
The field tests at present conducted by gas enterprises are 
listed in Table 2.

Technology Department of Petroleum Energy Center, Tonen Corp.] 
  [Text] The Petroleum Energy Center is an institution 
founded in 1986 to carry out research on the use of petroleum 
energy. 
  Since its foundation, development of naphtha/kerosene 
utilization technology for fuel cell systems has been one of the 
main programs. 
  The program consists of three subprograms to develop PAFC, 
MCFC and SOFC systems using light petroleum fraction such as 
naphtha or kerosene as raw fuel. 
<H5>  1. Development of PAFC </H5>
<H5>  1.1 Development of Naphtha Utilization Technology for PAFC </H5>
  PEC conducted a technology development program in order to 
utilize light petroleum fraction such as naphtha as raw fuel for 
PAFC from 1986 through 1990. 
  Seven petroleum, one electric appliances manufacturer and 
one 
engineering/construction company participated in this program. 
  Main topics of the technology development are as follow: 
  (1) developed catalysts for hydrodesulfurization, partial 
cracking hydrodesulfurization and adsorbing desulfurization of 
naphtha and/or kerosene; 
  (2) developed noble metal based catalysts for reforming; 
  (3) demonstrated naphtha-fed PAFCs (50, 80, 100, 200kW). 
<H3>  1.2 Technology Development for Commercialization of 
Naphtha-fed PAFC </H3>
  Based on technologies developed in the above mentioned 
program, we are now practicing a 5-year technology development 
program for commercialization of petroleum-fed PAFCS. In this 
program, six petroleum companies participated and two fuel cell 
manufacturers cooperate with PEC. 
  We have manufactured two naphtha-fed commercial prototype 
PAFCs (50, 200kW). 
  The differences between these two prototypes are seen in the 
types of the reforming catalysts, reformer types, fuel cell 
itself and so on. 
  The sizes of the prototypes were chosen because these are 
generally used in cogeneration in the market. 
  The 50kW prototype started its operation in this past July 
and is now continuing stable and satisfactory operation. It is 
located in Chiba prefecture, in an ``aqua-house'' which has fair 
number of Japanese type public baths in the building. 
  Electricity and heat are used for their water heating. 
  The 200kW prototype is going to start in this October and it 
is located in the research facilities area of RITE (Research 
Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth) situated in 
Kansai Science City in Kyoto. This 200kW prototype is one of new 
energy facilities in RITE consisting of fuel cell solar energy 
and wind energy test facilities. 
  The main stress of this project is put on catalysts 
development and total fuel cell system engineering. 
  The reforming catalysts used in these prototypes are the 
ones 
developed by PEC in the preceding 5-year program and improved 
later on. Also for improving the compactness of the fuel cell 
packages, PEC has developed a new ejecter type naphtha 
vapourizer. 
  The items to be verified are: 
  (1) demonstrate the activity and life of the 
hydrodesulfurization catalysts and reforming catalysts; 
  (2) demonstrate the reliability of the fuel cell; 
  (3) for the total system, demonstrate reliability, operating 
flexibility, maintenance ease, economics and so on. 
<H3>  1.3 Technology Development for Commercialization of 
Kerosene-fed PAFC </H3>
  As a raw fuel for fuel cells, kerosene is much harder to 
desulfurize and reform and needs newly developed catalysts. 
  In a catalysts evaluating pilot plant in the Advanced 
Technology &amp; Research Institute which is an organization of 
PEC, 
several catalysts developed by PEC are being tested now to 
decide the best one to the kerosene-fed PAFC. 
  The 200kW kerosene-fed experimental prototype is now being 
manufactured and will start its operation in the above mentioned 
laboratory in late 1994. 
<H5>  2. Development of MCFC </H5>
<H3>  2.1 Development of Naphtha Utilization Technology for 
External Reforming MCFC </H3>
  PEC conducted a technology development program in order to 
utilize light petroleum fraction such as naphtha as raw fuel for 
External Reforming MCFC from 1986 through 1990. 
  One petroleum, one electric appliances manufacturer and one 
engineering/construction company participated in this program. 
  Summary of the technology development is as follows: 
  (1) developed reforming catalysts for MCFC; 
  (2) investigated effect of sulfur compounds and water 
included in reformed gas on fuel cell components; 
  (3) improved materials for wet seals and electrolytes; 
  (4) demonstrated a naphtha-fed External Reforming MCFC 
(10kW) 
attaining the target efficiency of 45&percnt;. 
<H3>  2.2 Development of Light Petroleum Fraction Utilization 
Technology for Internal Reforming MCFC </H3>
  PEC has been conducting a 5-year technology development 
program in order to utilize light petroleum fraction such as 
naphtha for internal reforming MCFC since 1990. 
  Two petroleum, one electric appliances manufacturer and one 
engineering/construction company have been taking part in this 
program. 
  Outline of the technology development is as follows: 
  (1) demonstrated 10kW direct internal reforming MCFC stack 
and test data are now checked against the design. The size is 
one of the biggest in the world; 
  (2) 30kW direct internal reforming MCFC system will be made 
in 1994 and a continuous run is planned; 
  (3) the mechanism of catalysts poisoning by molten carbonate 
has been studied and been minimized both from liquid phase and 
vapour phase. From this development, the single cell is 
continuing its run beyond 6,000 hours. 
<H5>  3. Development of SOFC </H5>
  PEC has been conducting a 5-year technology development 
program in order to utilize light petroleum fraction such as 
naphtha for SOFC since 1990. 
  Three petroleum companies have been taking part in this 
program. 
  Outline of the technology development is as follows: 
<H5>  1) Tubular SOFC System </H5>
  (1) Developed a thin layer electrode and electrolyte by 
plasma spray which is a method to give good possibility of large 
cost-down in the manufacturing of SOFC cell compared with the 
ECVD method. 
  (2) Developed a reforming catalyst which gives methane rich 
reformed gas. This reformed gas has an internal cooling effect 
in a fuel cell by its heat absorption in a reforming reaction to 
hydrogen and can improve the total heat efficiency by decreasing 
external cooling medium. 
<H5>  2) Planar SOFC System </H5>
  (1) Improved properties of electrolyte, electrode, and 
separater and thus demonstrated a 1.3kW stack at 50&percnt; fuel 
utilization, 0.2w/cm, 
  (2) Attained power density of 0.19w/cm at 5cm square single 
cell at 40&percnt; efficiency, 
  (3) A 10kW stack will be attained in 1994.

<H5>  Development of Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell Power Plants </H5>
  Fuji's development focuses on three primary applications: 
on-site cogeneration power plants, large scale power plants 
suitable for Electric Utilities and vehicular power systems. 
Together with three gas utilities: Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Toho 
Gas, 50kW and 100kW power plants are developing for 
commercialization. 
  More than 60 units of 50kW and 100kW including NEDO's field 
testing plants are operating on customer's sites such as hotels, 
office buildings, factories and other places. 
  In addition to 50kW and 100kW plants, Fuji is developing 
500kW on-site PAFC plants in cooperation with Osaka Gas. The 
first prototype was installed at Osaka Gas for testing. Photo 1 
[photo not reproduced] shows 500kW plant. After improvement of 
these prototype models to get better reliability, commercial 
models will be completed by 1996. 
  Fuji has installed 77 PAFC test plants as shown in Table 1: 
64 plants in 77 are on-site fuel cells, 4 plants are power 
plants for Electric Utilities.

  Based on these PAFC experiences, Fuji has started to 
manufacture a 5MW plant under the direction of the NEDO/PAFC 
Technology Research Association. All equipment except the fuel 
cell stacks have been installed on site. Six 860kW stacks are 
being manufactured at the factory. The 5MW plant is planned to 
be completed in March 1994. 
  For vehicular application, Fuji is participating in the DOE 
fuel cell bus program and manufacturing the first 50kW power 
system for a small prototype bus. 
<H5>  Development of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells </H5>
  Fuji Electric has been developing planar solid oxide fuel 
cells since 1987. 
  Development of a substrate type planar cell has been done 
under the NEDO Project since 1989 and a 410W stack using 10 
cells of 200cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  has operated successfully. The next 
target is to manufacture kW class stacks using larger size cells.

Development Division, the Kansai Electric Power Co. Inc.] 
  [Text] The Kansai Electric Power achieved significant 
results as a leader in the development of phosphoric acid 
``first generation'' fuel cells. We are now making excellent 
progress in the research and development of molten carbonate 
``second generation'' fuel cells. Developing a 100kW class 
stack, the largest of its type in the world, is one of the 
results of our current program. 
  Molten carbonate fuel cells have not only the same 
attractive 
features as phosphorous acid fuel cells, but also other 
advantages which are high generating efficiencies, low cost from 
not using platinum catalysts at all and the availability of coal 
gas. 
  Fuel cells produce hydrogen in their reformer from fuels 
such 
as natural gas. Internal reforming is accomplished by fuel cells 
that contain this reformer within the main body of the fuel 
cell. The two types of these fuel cells are the direct and 
indirect types; they are distinguished by how their reformer 
catalysts are filled. In the indirect type, since the reformer 
is isolated from the electrode within the fuel cell, 
deterioration of the reformer catalyst caused by the electrolyte 
can be prevented. This type of fuel cell also features high 
efficiency because it utilizes heat from the cell reaction. 
  We anticipate that indirect-type internal reforming fuel 
cells will yield high generating efficiency, feature a long 
service life, and be feasible for near-term commercial 
installations. For these reasons we, jointly with Mitsubishi 
Electric, have been proceeding in earnest with their 
development. We began in 1988 by developing a 3kW class stack. 
By 1992 we had developed 10kW class, 30kW class, and 100kW class 
stacks. Operating them for over 2,000 hours yielded promising 
results, including favorable basic characteristics and low 
deterioration rates. While developing these stacks, we also 
developed a CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recycling system in which PSA 
(Pressure Swing Adsorption) equipment is used to extract 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from exhaust gas of the anode and recycle 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  to the cathode. Each of these technologies was 
developed with the intention of future commercial application. 
  Based on what we have learned, we expect to achieve 
generating efficiencies of 60&percnt; for about 50MW class, and 
50&percnt; 
for small scale 1MW class internal reforming molten carbonate 
fuel cells plants. 
  We now intend to verify our expectations regarding 
generating 
efficiencies and other basic characteristics by developing and 
operating a small-size plant. After doing so, our next step will 
be to develop a high-efficiency MW class plant.

Environmental Technology Department, Central Research 
Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation] 
  [Text] Research and development of fuel cells by Mitsubishi 
Electric Corporation started with pioneering research on molten 
carbonate fuel cells in the 1960s. It was followed by full scale 
R&amp;D of power plants which started in the late 1970s. 
<H5>  Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells </H5>
<H5>  (1) Development of On-site 200-kW Fuel Cells </H5>
  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (MELCO) has been developing the 
phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) with the intention of early 
practical use, through the advancement of component technology 
and demonstration power plants, mostly conducted under the 
``Moonlight Project'' promoted by the Agency of Industrial 
Science and Technology, MITI. As a typical activity, the 200-kW 
cogeneration system installed at the Hotel Plaza was able to 
obtain excellent results in both performance and practicability 
through the field operation, and accomplished more than 130,000 
hours generation at the end of October, 1991. 
  The second 200-kW power plant for Kansai Electric Power Co., 
Inc. (KEPCO) was installed on Rokko Island in November, 1991 as 
a demonstration project of new power generation for dispersed 
use, supported by MITI, and various testings such as switching 
to the isolated grid without interruption at an occurrence of 
utility failure are progressing successfully. 
  The third 200-kW on site co-generation plant for the 
Technical Research Center (TRC) of KEPCO was installed in April 
1993 and operation is now being conducted. (Figure 1 [figure not 
reproduced]) 
  Most recently, a 200-kW system for Yanai P/S of Chugoku 
Electric Power Co., was installed in May 1993, aiming to test 
for dispersed use. (Figure 2 [figure not reproduced]) 
<H5>  (2) Status and Plan of PAFC Development </H5>
  It can be said that the basic technology for PAFC has 
already 
been developed and verified through the aforementioned 
experiences. At present, development efforts on PAFC are made to 
realize a compact and low cost plant with high reliability which 
can meet the market needs. 
  Table 1 shows our activities and plans for 200-kW PAFC. The 
technical subjects in Table 1 are going to be overcome for the 
next plant and commercial plants.

<H5>  Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells </H5>
  The development of molten carbonate fuel cells lays emphasis 
on the realization of the internal reforming, which is a process 
of reforming fuel such as natural gas, inside the cell by 
placing reforming catalyst in the cell and effectively utilizing 
heat and generated steam. This process is subdivided into direct 
reforming and indirect reforming. The development of the direct 
internal reforming (DIR) type has been carried out under support 
by NEDO. A 5kW stack (5000cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; , 10 cells) was 
successfully operated for more than one year (10,190 hours) with 
the decay rate of 4mV/1000 hours, performance of averaged cell 
voltage of 0.78V at 150 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; , 80&percnt; fuel 
utilization. In addition, a 30kW stack is now under operation 
and shows good performance which meets the target set by NEDO. 
(Figure 3 [figure not reproduced]) 
  The indirect internal reforming (IIR) type has a structure 
in 
which the reforming catalyst is placed in separate containers 
and inserted between stacked cells. Although its power 
generating efficiency is lower than that of the direct type, it 
is free from the problem of catalyst deterioration and it can 
expect an early practical application. MELCO is pursuing the 
development of the indirect type jointly with the Kansai 
Electric Co., Inc. A 100-kW stack was successfully operated in 
1992. Output power of the stack was 109kW and it was operated 
for 2,308 hours. In the testing, CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recycle and the 
use of city gas were evaluated. 
  Based on the results accumulated in these years, a new 
concept which hybridizes DIR with IIR, is now going to be 
developed. A 5-kW stack for conceptual evaluation is already 
successfully being operated now. This concept brings high system 
efficiency as well as long life time which leads to a practical 
next generation technology (dispersed and/or central power 
station application) in the near future.

Industries Co., Ltd.] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (IHI) has 
developed the molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) under the NEDO 
(New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization) 
Program as part of the New Sunshine Project of MITI since 1987. 
  Recent significant results of MCFC development are two 50kW 
class stacks and a 100kW class stack, which is the target of the 
former phase of the MCFC Program. 
  The 100kW stack is now under power generation test at the 
Akagi Stack and System Square. 
  Following the development of 100kW stack, a 1MW MCFC pilot 
plant is planned for construction from 1994, under the Program. 
<H5>  1. Large Capacity Stack </H5>
  IHI has been developing an internally manifolded co-flow 
type 
stack, in which the fuel gas and oxidant gas flow in the same 
direction. One of the advantages of this co-flow type is easy to 
enlarge the cell area in the orthogonal direction of the gas 
flow without changing the reaction pattern. With this principal, 
IHI has developed a rectangular cell with 1m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  active 
area, 560mm length by 1,800mm width, which is called ``tatami 
type'' owing to its shape. The green tape of the electrode and 
electrolyte is cast by the doctor blade method, and the 
electrode is sintered in the electric furnace. The separator is 
fabricated with stainless steel thin sheets by automatic welding 
machine. For assembling of the stack, a mechanical handling 
device has been developed in order to make the accurate stacking 
speedy. 
  Figure 1 shows the history of the stack development at IHI. 
The recent results of the stack development are presented as 
follows. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-001LC-23A>           Figure 1. Development Program of MCFC Stack </FIG>




<H5>  2. 50kW Stack Test </H5>
  Prior to the development of the 100kW stack, two 50kW stacks 
were developed. 
  The first 50kW stack had the purpose of establishing the 
tall 
stacking technology for 50 cells with 1m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and 
verifying over 50kW power generation (Figure 2 [figure not 
reproduced]). This stacks power generation test was carried out 
in spring of 1992, and successfully generated for more than 
2,500 hours with good performance. 
  Maximum power output was 55kW with conditioning of 
70&percnt; fuel 
utilization and 150 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  current density. 
  The second 50kW stack was developed to estimate the stack 
performance with an intermediate holder and to discuss the stack 
transportation because of the necessity to transport from the 
IHI site to the Akagi Square for the 100kW stack. 
  This 50kW stack consists of 25 cells on both upper and lower 
sides of the intermediate holder, respectively (Figure 3 [figure 
not reproduced]). The stack successfully generated 55.7kW at 150 
mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  current density and 84&percnt; fuel utilization. 
Difference of average cell voltage between upper and lower part 
of the stack was very small. After the initial power generation 
test, the stack was cooled down and transported around the IHI 
factory, and then the power generation test was carried out 
again to confirm no changes in its performance. 
<H5>  3. 100kW Stack Test </H5>
  100kW stack consists of two blocks of 51 cells with 
1m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  active area on both upper and lower sides of an 
intermediate holder, respectively (Figure 4 [figure not 
reproduced]). This stack was assembled in May of this year 
(Figure 5 [figure not reproduced]), and the initial power 
generation test was carried out in the 50kW test facility. The 
power output was 62kW at 70 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and 44&percnt; fuel 
utilization. After the initial power generation test, it was 
cooled down and transported to the Akagi Square and is being 
tested at this time. 
<H5>  Acknowledgments </H5>
  IHI intends to pour its energies into the early 
commercialization of MCFC plants. IHI appreciates the support 
and assistance of related groups, especially those of the AIST, 
NEDO, the MCFC Research Association and utility companies.

  [Text] At present the Japanese economy continues along an 
adjustment phase and while there were indications in early 
spring of a partial recovery, after that the economy continued 
to remain flat. Although the business diffusion index 
(coincident index) stayed above the ``boom or bust'' threshold 
of 50&percnt; for the three months from February to April, in 
May the 
index fell considerable below this level. In terms of production 
and employment trends, there is a strong possibility that the 
figures for June and July will also fall below this level. While 
production in June increased when compared to the previous 
month, the level was low and even the inventory cycle shows 
signs of a mild recession. Employment conditions continue to 
deteriorate and individual consumption is sluggish, for the most 
part. Moreover, machinery orders (private demand), a leading 
indicator of capital spending, are as weak as ever. On the other 
hand, housing investments continue to recover and investment in 
public utilities is also firm. 
<H5>  Industrial Activity </H5>
  The index of industrial production for June (preliminary 
reports) increased 1.3&percnt; compared with the previous month. 
On an 
industry specific basis, all industries except plastic goods and 
mining had increases. The index of producers' shipments 
increased 2.1&percnt; compared with the previous month. Although 
iron 
and steel, plastic goods and mining were down, all other 
industries had increases. Because inventories of iron and steel, 
general machinery and transport machinery increased, the index 
of producers' inventories rose 0.4&percnt; compared with the 
previous 
month. However, because the increase in shipments exceeded this, 
the index of the producers' inventory ratio fell 1.2&percnt; 
during 
the same period. The forecast index of industrial activity 
(seasonally adjusted) has forecast that production will increase 
0.1&percnt; in July compared to the previous month and fall 
0.9&percnt; in 
August for the same period. 
<H5>  Capital Spending </H5>
  Looking at concurrent indicators, the June index of capital 
goods shipments (excluding transportation machinery) increased 
3.0&percnt; over the previous month, mainly for general-use steam 
turbines and compressors. According to leading indicators, in 
June machinery orders (private demand excluding that for ships 
and electric power) only had a mild increase of 0.8&percnt; 
overall 
compared with the previous month because even though the 
manufacturing industry (up 12.0&percnt; compared with the 
previous 
month) had increases (mainly for electronic and communications 
equipment), the non-manufacturing sector (down 6.6&percnt; 
during the 
same period) declined. Construction orders (private sector) in 
June were down for both the manufacturing industry (down 
50.0&percnt; 
compared with the previous year) and the non-manufacturing 
industry (down 17.8&percnt; during the same period) and as a 
result 
there was an overall decline of 24.7&percnt; compared to the 
previous 
year. This was the 15th consecutive month of decline. 
<H5>  Housing Investment </H5>
  Comparing the number of housing starts in June to those of 
the previous year we find that while rental units declined for 
the second consecutive month, owner-occupied units had their 
first upward shift in three months while subdivided units also 
had large increases for the second consecutive month. This 
resulted in an overall increase of 4.1&percnt; compared with the 
previous year, for a total of 134,000 starts (seasonally 
adjusted annualized rate of 1,447 thousand units). (A breakdown 
of the raw (unadjusted) figures shows: 49,000 owner-occupied 
homes, up 3.8&percnt; from the previous year; 60,000 rental 
units, 
down 1.2&percnt; during the same period; 3,000 subsidized housing 
units, down 16.0&percnt; during the same period; and 22,000 
subdivided 
units, up 26.6&percnt; during the same period.) 
<H5>  Consumption </H5>
  According to household surveys, in May nominal consumption 
expenditures by all households fell 1.1&percnt; compared to the 
same 
period the previous year (real expenditures decreased 1.8&percnt; 
during the same period), the first decline in three months 
compared with the previous year. A breakdown of these results 
shows that the only three items of expenditure which had 
increases were light and heat, water and insured medical 
treatment and that, with the exception of cultural 
entertainment, which remained flat, all other items had 
declines. In particular, sundry and housing expenditures 
declined dramatically. By household category, worker households' 
consumption expenditures decreased by 0.5&percnt; compared to the 
previous year while general households' consumption also had a 
decrease of 2.3&percnt; for the same period. 
  In June total sales by large retail outlets declined 
3.5&percnt; 
over the previous year (down 4.8&percnt; after adjusting for the 
number of branches). This was the eleventh consecutive month of 
decline. Reflecting the unseasonable weather, sales of summer 
gifts had a slow start and the slump in sales of summer clothing 
continues, particularly for men's clothing. On a sector specific 
basis, department store sales fell 7.6&percnt; during this period 
(clothing down 7.7&percnt;, food and beverages down 5.1&percnt;, 
others down 
9.3&percnt;) and supermarket sales increased 1.2&percnt; during 
the same 
period (clothing up 0.7&percnt;, food and beverages up 
2.0&percnt;, others 
up 0.6&percnt;). Still, supermarkets are down 1.2&percnt; 
compared with last 
year after adjusting for the number of stores. 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  Looking at the employment situation for June (preliminary 
reports), the index of regular employment for all industries 
remains unchanged when compared with that of the previous month. 
The demand for labor continues to show signs of easing and the 
effective openings-to-applications ratio fell 0.07 points 
compared to the previous month to 0.74. In addition, at 
2.50&percnt; 
the total unemployment rate was 0.02 percentage points lower 
than that of the previous month. Overtime hours for the 
manufacturing industry decreased 2.1&percnt; compared to the 
previous 
month (12.0 hours/month).

of Industrial Science and Technology] 
  [Text] The research and development of fuel cells in Japan 
made its formal start in 1981 when they were taken up in the 
Moonlight Project (R&amp;D project of energy saving technology). 
R&amp;D 
were successfully concluded for alkaline fuel cells (AFC) in 
fiscal 1984 and phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC) in fiscal 1990. 
  The PAFC developed in this project has already achieved an 
overall energy efficiency of 80.2&percnt; and cumulative power 
generating time of 13,038 hours for the 200-kW combination 
module of thermal and electric power installed in a hotel, and 
power generating efficiency of 39.7&percnt; (the world's highest 
record for ordinary pressure operation) and cumulative operating 
time of 8,449 hours for the 200-kW power generating type 
installed on a remote island. These brilliant results are 
accelerating the practical application of these fuel cells. 
  R&amp;D are progressing at present on three types of fuel 
cells, 
namely: molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC), solid oxide fuel 
cells (SOFC) and polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC). Molten 
carbonate fuel cells constitute the center of the development 
project since they can serve as an energy source alternative to 
thermal power and enable the utilization of coal gasificated 
fuel as fuel (Table 1). 



  As for MCFC, we have developed during fiscal 1993 a 100-kW 
stack (which achieved the world's record output of 110.4-kW as 
MCFC in premises tests) and 1,000-kW class peripheral equipment 
and carried out their performance evaluations. A 1,000-kW class 
generating system will be developed by fiscal 1997 targeted at 
higher performance, longer service life and lower production 
cost (Table 2-1).

  The present schedule calls for the development by fiscal 
1995 
of solid oxide fuel cells of several kilowatts, which raises 
hope for an effective utilization of waste heat produced from 
high output density and high temperature operation in addition 
to the same excellent features as MCFC. After the evaluation of 
new cells, a module of 20-30kW class will be developed by about 
fiscal 1997. 
  Furthermore, we plan to develop by fiscal 1995 polymer 
electrolyte fuel cells having the possibility of miniaturization 
and weight reduction with the highest output density, and go on 
to the development of generating systems of 1kW. 
  The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology inaugurated 
in 1993 the New Sunshine Project unifying the previous Sunshine 
Project for the technology development of petroleum-alternative 
energy, the Moonlight Project for developing the technology of 
economizing energy and the Global Environment Technology R&amp;D 
in 
order to bring about a breakthrough for the solution of energy 
and environmental problems which have now become global issues. 
The development of fuel cell power generation under the new 
project envisages an improved environment with the interaction 
between cost reduction through higher technology and increased 
demand. This will accelerate the pace of R&amp;D. We hope that 
early 
introduction and diffusion of fuel cell power generation will 
materialize through closer cooperation between government and 
the private sector.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The fuel cell is a highly efficient and clean power 
generation technology which does not cause any environmental 
problems such as SOx and NOx emissions, noise or hot drained 
water. Therefore, Japan is greatly interested in the development 
and practical use of this technology. In Japan, a fuel cell R/D 
national project was started in 1981 sponsored by the Agency of 
Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI). And from 1991, a new 
field-test project as well as a demonstration project for 
promoting PAFC systems was started sponsored by the Agency of 
National Resources and Energy (ANRE) of MITI. 
  NEDO, a semi-governmental organization founded in 1980 to 
promote national R/D projects on oil-alternative energy 
technology, has managed Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC), Molten 
Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC), Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and 
Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC) type of projects. 
<H5>  1. PAFC Project </H5>
  The timetable of NEDO's PAFC projects is shown in Figure 1. 



<H5>  1.1 R/D Project </H5>
  NEDO completed the R/D activities on PAFC under the AIST 
project. In this project, 1MW pressurized type plants for power 
utility use and 200kW atmospheric pressure type plants for 
on-site use were developed in fiscal 1990. 
<H5>  1.2 Demonstration Project </H5>
  After the success of the PAFC R/D projects under AIST, NEDO 
started a new demonstration projects for promoting the 
commercialization of PAFC in 1991 under the ANRE. In this 
project, a 5MW pressurized type plant in power utility and a 1MW 
atmospheric pressure type in the commercial sector are to be 
developed and demonstrated by fiscal 1996. 
<H5>  5MW Plant Project </H5>
  The target of this project is to develop a 5MW pressurized 
plant with net generation efficiency of more than 42&percnt; 
(HHV). 
Through the priority of system design is to get as highly 
generation efficiency as possible. Other targets are hot steam 
of about 170&deg;C and hot water of about 80&deg;C to be 
recovered and utilized near the site, and high temperature off 
gas to be utilized for a gas turbine generator. 
  The plant will be fabricated by Fuji Electric Co. Ltd. and 
installed at Amagasaki Technoland of Kansai Electric Power 
Company in the end of fiscal 1993. 
<H5>  1MW Plant Project </H5>
  The target of this project is to develop a 1MW unpressurized 
plant to supply steam with the temperature level of 170&deg;C as 
well as electric power. This system's priorities are recovered 
steam utilized as a heat source of double effect absorption type 
of a chiller for an air conditioner, and compactness. 
  The plant will be fabricated by Toshiba Corporation and 
installed at the Tokyo Gas Company in fiscal 1994. 
<H5>  1.3 Field Test Project </H5>
  Fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1994, install PAFC systems project is 
started for acquired operation and maintenance records of the 
system. 
  The cost is shared between NEDO and participants of the 
project such as hotels, restaurants, offices and so on. 
  A capacity ranging 50-500kW of about 15 PAFC systems are 
operated and 15 systems will be operated in this project. 
<H5>  2. MCFC Project </H5>
  MCFC project started in fiscal 1981 under the AIST project, 
and NEDO has been its main implementing agency of the project 
since fiscal 1984. At present, 100kW class stacks by external 
reforming type of cells are developed and assessed by fiscal 
1993. Then, the fabrication of a 1,000kW pilot plant will 
immediately start and operation tests will be completed by 
fiscal 1997. 
  The timetable of NEDO's MCFC projects is shown in Figure 2. 



<H5>  2.1 R/D for Large Capacity Cell Stack </H5>
<H5>  Multiple Type of Cell and Stack </H5>
  The multiple large capacity type of cell has an almost 
square 
1.2m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  total effective electrode area consisting of 4 
small unit cells with internal manifolds and cross gas flow. The 
stack was fabricated by Hitachi Ltd. 
  In fiscal 1990, a 25kW stack with 22 cells was developed. 
The 
stack has been tested 5,700 hours under pressurized conditions. 
  After the above mentioned results, a 100kW stack consisting 
of two 50kW class modules with 44 cells and an intermediate gas 
header was fabricated. From April of 1993, the stack was 
installed and tested at Akagi Stack and System Square (ASSS), 
which was opened in autumn of 1990 to perform the demonstration 
test on stacks as well as peripheral equipment development by 
this project. The results of maximum power of this test is 113kW. 
  In addition to this work, the research for high performance 
and long life are being performed. And endurance tests of 
lab-scale single cell test were started at the Government 
Industrial Research Institute, Osaka (GIRIO) where target 
operation time is more than 15,000 hours. 
<H5>  Rectangular Type of Cell and Stack </H5>
  The rectangular large capacity type of cell has 560mm x 
1800mm of almost 1m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  total effective electrode area 
with internal manifolds and parallel gas flow. The stack was 
fabricated by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. 
(IHI). 
  In fiscal 1991, a 50kW stack with 50 cells was developed. 
The 
stack has been tested for more than 2,500 hours under 
pressurized conditions. 
  After the above mentioned results, a 100kW stack with 102 
cells was fabricated. From August of 1993, the stack was 
installed and tested at ASSS. The results of maximum power of 
this test is 129kW. 
  In addition to this work, the research for high performance 
and long life are being performed. And endurance tests of 
lab-scale single cell test were also started at GIRIO. 
<H5>  Internal Reforming Type of Cell and Stack </H5>
  An internal reforming type of cell is a cell which generates 
electricity by effectively using heat and steam generated 
through cell reaction and by reforming fuel such as natural gas 
inside the cell. 
  In fiscal 1989, a 5kW stack with 10 cells, each cell's 
effective electrode area is 5000cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  was developed. 
The stack has been tested for more than 10,000 hours under 
atmospheric pressure of stack conditions. The stack was 
fabricated by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MEC). 
  After the above mentioned results, a 30kW stack with 57 
cells 
was fabricated. From July of 1993, the stack was installed and 
tested at MEC. The results of maximum power of this test is 33kW. 
  In addition to this work, the research for high performance 
and long life are being performed. Endurance tests of lab-scale 
single cell test were also started at GIRIO. 
<H5>  2.2 Development of Balance of Plant Technology </H5>
  The development of BOP technology use for the 1MW class 
pilot 
plant is being researched and developed at ASSS by dividing the 
overall plant except the fuel cell stack into the following 
subsystem. 
<H5>  Control Subsystem </H5>
  For the study of control technology, a dummy stack plant 
consisting of actual peripheral equipment with the same system 
configuration as a 1000kW pilot plant was developed and 
installed at ASSS. With this model plant, start-up and shut-down 
tests, dynamic response tests, load following tests, minimum 
load tests and so on were demonstrated. 
<H5>  Stack Peripheral Subsystem </H5>
  Instrumentation and control technology for recycling and 
reutilization of exhaust fuel gas and air are studied to operate 
the power plant effectively and stably. The equipment for 
recycling such as an MC scrubber and high temperature blower and 
others is also developed. 
<H5>  Fuel Processing Subsystem </H5>
  A heat exchange type and a two-state catalytic combustion 
type reformer are developed to effectively obtain hydrogen gas 
of good quality even from the combustion flow-caloric exhaust 
gas. 
<H5>  Heat Recovery Subsystem </H5>
  Equipment and systems such as a heat recovery steam 
generator, a turbine compressor, etc., are developed to convert 
MCFC-exhausted high-temperature gas energy into steam as well as 
motive power. 
<H5>  3. SOFC Project </H5>
  SOFC project was started in fiscal 1981 under the AIST 
project, and has been its main implementing agency of the 
project since fiscal 1989. The first three years of this 
project, NEDO developed basic fabrication technologies of cells. 
After this project, the phase 2 project was started to develop 
several ten kW class cell modules for R/D from fiscal 1992. 
  The timetable of NEDO's SOFC project is shown in Figure 3. 



<H5>  3.1 Basic Research Project </H5>

effective electrode area of more than 100cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  whose 
voltage was more than 0.7V at 300mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; , and also to 
develop a stack with a capacity of over 100W. 
  In this project, five different types of SOFC development 
technology were tested. There were ceramic separator technology, 
alloy separator technology, co-fire technology and composite 
electrode technology of planar type cells, and plasma spray 
coating technology for air electrodes of a tubular type of cell. 
<H5>  3.2 R/D Project </H5>
  After the success of the above mentioned project, NEDO 
started a new R/D project under AIST from fiscal 1992 - fiscal 
1997. The main objectives are the development of several kW SOFC 
modules of planar type, internal reforming technology and 
processing technology by fiscal 1995. After that several 10kW 
planar types of SOFC modules will be developed by fiscal 1997. 
<H5>  4. PEFC Project </H5>
  NEDO has started a new four years project for PEFC from 
fiscal 1992 under AIST. The main objective is to develop 1kW 
modules with air and hydrogen by fiscal 1997. The timetable of 
NEDO's PEFC project is shown in Figure 4. 



<H5>  5. Other Projects </H5>

Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell, Technology Research Association] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Much attention has been paid to fuel cells since the 1970s 
in 
Japan because of the expectation for their excellent energy 
efficiency and environmentally friendly power generation. Among 
several types of fuel cells being developed, phosphoric acid 
fuel cells (PAFC) offer the highest promise of practical 
application in the near future as an advanced power generation 
plant, and thus R&amp;D on PAFC systems has been promoted 
vigorously. 
  Japan's original R&amp;D activity for PAFC power plants was 
initiated in 1981 as part of the government's Moonlight Project. 
Following the development of fundamental technology and 
elemental components, two types of 1MW PAFC pilot plants for 
utility application and two types of 200kW cogeneration pilot 
plants for on-site and remote island application were developed. 
The demonstration tests of these plants were conducted 
successfully in 1987-88 and 1989-91, respectively. 
  In the private sector, Japanese major electric and gas 
utility companies started their R&amp;D on PAFC in the 1970s, and 
demonstration tests of a 4.5MW PAFC power plant and 40kW on-site 
fuel cells were carried out in the middle of '80s at a power 
station and customer sites. Research and development work on 
elemental components, such as fuel cell stack, reformer and 
inverter, and on system technology has been pursued under these 
projects, resulting in substantial development progress of 
fundamental technologies for PAFC power plants. PAFC development 
for practical application has been continued into the 1990s. The 
efforts included the demonstration test of an 11MW power plant 
for utility use and field tests of 50 to 200kW on-site fuel 
cells. 
  Considering these developments, MITI started in 1991 and 
1992 
two projects aiming at early market entry of PAFC. One is the 
field test of small-size, on-site fuel cells at various customer 
sites. In this project, private field test programs are 
subsidized by NEDO. The other is the development of two 
large-scale PAFC power plants -- a 5MW PAFC power plant for 
urban energy center application and a 1MW on-site PAFC 
cogeneration plant. A PAFC technology research association 
established in 1991 by fourteen electric and gas utility 
companies is promoting development and demonstration tests of 
these power plants. 
<H3>  Demonstration, Evaluation and Field Tests of Small-Size 
On-Site Fuel Cells </H3>
  In 1993, over 50 on-site PAFC power generation units, 
ranging 
in capacity from 50kW to 500kW, are being operated at various 
customer buildings and utility testing facilities in Japan for 
demonstration and evaluation. Some of these efforts are 
subsidized by MITI, with NEDO funding one third of the 
installation cost. 
  Efficiency, compactness and environmental features have been 
almost achieved to meet the requirements of the market. 
Reliability and durability have also been improved. One of these 
on-site PAFC power plants has already attained a total operating 
time of over 15,000 hours -- the longest ever. It also has 
achieved the longest continuous operation time of over 5,000 
hours. Most recent plants show availability of around 80&percnt;. 
<H3>  Development and Demonstration of 5000kW and 1000kW PAFC 
Power Plants </H3>
  A 6-year development and demonstration project, involving a 
5000kW class PAFC power plant for urban energy center 
application and a 1000kW class PAFC power plant for large-scale 
cogeneration, was started in 1991 as an NEDO and PAFC-TRA 
collaboration. This project aims to establish technologies for 
utilizing PAFCs in electric utility application and 
commercializing large-scale PAFC cogeneration systems, from the 
aspects of reliability and cost reduction. 
<H5>  (1) 5000kW PAFC Power Plant </H5>
  Major subjects considered in the development of the 5000kW 
PAFC power plant are as follows: 
  -- High electrical efficiency plant for electric utility use 
  -- Dispersed electric power generation in urban areas 
  -- Grid connection and weekly start-and-stop (WSS) operation 
  -- Environmental soundness (low emissions) 
  -- Waste heat recovery system for urban energy center 
application 
  Table 1 summarizes the target specifications of the 5000kW 
PAFC power plant. An external view of the plant building is 
shown in Photo 1 [photo not reproduced].

<H5>  Future Prospects </H5>
  Development of PAFC power plant technology has now reached 
the stage where small-size, on-site fuel cells are on the 
threshold of practical application. Major problems yet to be 
overcome for commercialization are reliability and cost. 
  Vigorous efforts toward commercial application of PAFC 
plants 
are in progress in both the public and private sectors through 
day-to-day technological development and testing, with 
particular emphasis placed on reliability improvement meeting 
the user's requirements in a few years. Manufacturers are also 
stepping up their efforts to advance PAFC technology, including 
mass production systems, that could lead to substantial cost 
reduction. 
  Policy and marketing strategy for practical application of 
PAFCs are being addressed on a nationwide scale. The market 
penetration of PAFC power plants is expected to begin in the 
middle of the 1990s.

  [Text] A government, industry, and academic joint project 
led by the Agency for Science and Technology (STA) on 
``Functionally Gradient Materials (FGM) for Energy Conversion'' 
has been introduced. FGMs are considered next-generation new 
materials capable of producing a high-efficiency energy 
conversion system with high-power output. The technology 
development in this area has been attracting considerable 
attention because of its application potential as a source of 
electricity in space stations and direct electricity generation 
reactors. This project constitutes comprehensive research funded 
by the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and 
Technology. It is a 5-year project starting in FY93. The first 
phase (3 years) of the project includes: FGMs for various types 
of energy conversion such as the ``thermoelectric conversion 
element'' which can convert energy efficiently by gradually 
changing the composition and the structure of the materials; and 
the development of high-efficiency, high-performance energy 
conversion. The second phase (2 years) includes the 
establishment of the key technology for design and manufacturing 
for application in space systems. 
  FGMs are composite materials created from materials that 
perform completely different functions. Joined together, the 
materials gradually change in composition and structure from one 
side to the other. This is a new concept that originated in 
Japan. It results in new materials which share the advantages of 
a number of materials. When FGMs are used for thermoelectric 
conversion elements that convert high heat into electricity, for 
example, the energy conversion efficiency rate increases 
tremendously. 
  This comprehensive research project will pursue development 
of manufacturing technology and structural control technology by 
focusing on thermoelectric conversion which involves a great 
deal of crucial development of functionally gradient structures 
among various energy conversion materials. It is theoretically 
possible to create materials that perform at high efficiency and 
high output by applying FGM technology to thermoelectric 
conversion elements which have maximum performance indexes at 
particular temperature levels. Furthermore, the project team 
plans to examine technical viability of developing an 
``ultra-high efficiency energy conversion system'' which can 
combine functionally gradient structured thermoelectric, 
thermionic high energy conversion elements at their most 
appropriate energy levels. 
  The participants of the project include the STA, the 
National 
Aerospace Laboratory, the National Research Institute of Metals, 
MITI's National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research of 
the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute 
of Technology, Kogakuin University, Daikin Industries, Ltd., and 
Hitachi, Ltd.

Materials''] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The concept of smart material and adaptive structure 
equipped 
with a combination of abilities to detect, (sensor function), to 
judge, to arrive at conclusion (control function), and to 
trigger actions by issuing instructions (actuator function) on 
their own is a type of simulation modeled after bioentity. In 
order to create an intelligent materials and structures which 
can deal with changing environments and usage conditions by 
effecting changes in order to optimize a state in which they 
find themselves, a new design method known as adaptive design 
will be required. In this paper, we deal with adaptive design 
and its application examples. 
<H5>  Adaptive Design </H5>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-01A>           Fig. 1. Adaptive Design </FIG>



  A method of designing a conventional composite material and 
structure has sought the optimum of passive variables for shape 
and other elements. In other words, in Fig. 1, within a 
second-dimensional surface created by an evaluation function and 
passive variables, an optimal combination which satisfies a 
particular condition at hand has been sought. However, as 
environment and conditions became more severe, it has become 
necessary to satisfy a large number of conditions 
simultaneously. When an environment condition changed through 
time, in some cases, no matter how many times passive variables 
are changed, the optimal combination satisfying the condition 
simply was not found. The inclusion of a sensor, an actuator, 
and a controller in designing materials and structures to deal 
with this problem, however, meant an increased number of passive 
variables and search for the optimal combination in a 
3-dimensional space shown in Fig. 1. For instance, as in Fig. 1, 
conditions A and B could not be satisfied simultaneously using 
passive variables alone; however, if the scope of conditions A 
and B are changed by including active variables, the scope which 
satisfied conditions A and B can be formed within the range 
allowed. Thus, a method which designs the optimal material and 
structure by using both passive and active variables, namely, an 
adaptive design method, becomes necessary in designing 
intelligent materials and structures. 
<H5>  3. Functionally Gradient Intelligent Material System </H5>
  The functionally gradient material is a type of material 
designed to satisfy both thermal resistance and strength 
conditions by continuously changing the ratio of these two 
factors in material composition. Even if the two types of 
materials are mixed to produce the optimal gradient, with a 
thermal-resistant material maintained at super high temperatures 
and a strength material at normal temperatures, it is possible 
to relax the thermal stress of a functionally gradient material, 
thereby making it possible to place it within the allowable 
scope. However, this will be difficult unless thermal 
deformation is allowed. It also is difficult to produce the kind 
of a mixture ratio of the two types of materials enabling both 
thermal stress and thermal deformation of the functionally 
gradient material to be within the allowable scope. Moreover, 
even if stress has been eased when the thermal resistent 
material is maintained at super high temperatures when in use, 
still when both thermal resistant material and strength material 
maintain the same temperature when not in use, thermal stress 
may be generated, in which event problems will arise. In order 
to avoid this, it is necessary to introduce the concept of 
intelligent material, designed to adapt to any change which may 
occur in environment or in usage condition, into functionally 
gradient materials. This means the use of the adaptive method in 
designing of functionally gradient intellectual materials. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-02A>           Fig. 2. Functionally Gradient Intelligent </FIG>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-02D>              Fig. 5. Distribution of Young's Ratio and Poisson </FIG>




   As shown in Fig. 2, by adhering the laminated piezoelectric 
material to the functionally gradient material's low-temperature 
strength material side, a functionally gradient material system 
can be achieved. When the thermal resistant material side 
(Z&lt;sup&gt; r&lt;/sup&gt; O&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; ) is T&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; =1 100&deg;C and 
the strength material side (Ti&lt;inf&gt; 6&lt;/inf&gt; Al&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; V) is 
T&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; =0&deg;C, if the optimal functionally gradient 
material is designed by using the finite element method to 
achieve relaxation of thermal stress, as shown in Figs. 3-5, 
temperature, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion 
coefficient, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio are 
distributed in the direction of board thickness. Thermal 
deformation and thermal stress are as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. By 
adding voltage to a piezoelectric actuator, thermal deformation 
can be suppressed while maintaining thermal stress within the 
allowable range. By equipping a part of the actuator material 
with the sensor function and inserting it into an arithmetic 
board possessing the control function, the material will be able 
to maintain the optimal state even if temperature conditions of 
the high temperature side material is changing by minute.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-03D>             Fig. 9. Flutter Vibration Control Effect </FIG>




  Presented in Fig. 8 is an example of an intelligent material 
system in which piezoelectric film is bonded to both surfaces of 
a cantilever thin board, using one side as a sensor, the other 
as an actuator, and an external computer as a controller. When 
this cantilever thin board was installed in uniform parallel air 
currents and air speed exceeded a certain level, the thin board 
generated flutter and vibrated violently. The use of the 
actuator proved to be of no value as it was used after the 
flutter had occurred. The piezoelectric film was not powerful 
enough to stop the flutter. However, if control was activated 
even when the speed of air current was not sufficiently fast to 
create flutter, the system would sense the occurrence of 
flutter, and by activating the activator even when response 
amplitude was extremely small, it would be able to stop flutter. 
Consequently, as shown in Fig. 9, it is possible to realize a 
panel designed to prevent flutter from occurring until air 
current speed reaches the point where it exceeds the normal 
flutter flow speed. Moreover, if the actuator can generate 
powerful force, it will become possible to raise the limit of 
flow speed at which flutter will not be produced. This limit is 
determined by the use of an adaptive design which takes into 
consideration usage conditions. 
<H5>  Intelligent Arch </H5>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-03E>           Fig. 10. Intelligent Arch </FIG>



  Fig. 10 represents an example of the intelligent material 
system, designed to bond piezoelectric film to both sides of a 
half arch, using the portion of the film covering an area from 
O&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  to X&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  as a sensor, from 
X&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  to X&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  as an actuator, and an external 
personal computer as a controller. The adaptive design can be 
used to decide on the question of which part of the arch a 
piezoelectric film should be adhered to so that the response of 
the arch receiving forced vibration in both upward and downward 
directions can be minimized. As shown in Figs. 11 and 12, when a 
control input obtained on the basis of robust control theory was 
added to the actuator, we have found that results produced by a 
numerical simulation and an experiment for the most part were in 
agreement. Since control input 300V was added rapidly, a 
response at the initial point was large. However, this situation 
probably can be avoided if we are to increase control input 
gradually.

  In MRI system, it is necessary to run high-frequency current 
through gradient magnetic-field coils, which then will turn into 
a uniformly strong magnetic field. In order to enhance MRI 
system performance, it will be necessary to strengthen the 
uniform magnetic field and increase the frequency of 
high-frequency currents. This means that a electromagnetic force 
with a large high-frequency must be applied to the gradient 
magnetic field coils, as a result of which a fixed drum will be 
vibrated violently by the coils. The vibrations will be so 
severe that they will be difficult to stop even with the use of 
a damper attachment. In order to control electromagnetic 
vibration and eliminate noise, it will be necessary to develop 
an intelligent coil drum. The gradient magnetic field coil drum, 
as shown in Fig. 13, has a cylindrical surface equipped with two 
ring-shaped coils and two pairs of curved surface coils. 
Electric currents are run through these coils periodically, as a 
result of which the electromagnetic force (Lorentz force) is 
generated as it interacts with the strong magnetic field in the 
axial direction. This causes violent shaking in the coil drum. 
As shown in Fig. 14, vibrations can be damped actively by using 
distributed piezoelectric actuators. When the actuator is 
controlled and operated, as shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the 
vibration amplitude of drum coils become smaller. It was found 
that when the optimal distribution of the distributed 
piezoelectric actuators was obtained by using the adaptive 
design method, as clearly indicated in Case 2, damping effects 
were further improved. 
<H5>  7. Conclusion </H5>
  We have demonstrated that by designing an intelligent 
material using the adaptive design method, it became possible to 
create one with improved performance. Although here we used 
piezoelectric ceramics and piezoelectric filters, the 
magnetostrictive and other types of functionally gradient 
materials can be used. Moreover, since the electromagnetic 
functional material is equipped with the combination of sensor 
and actuator functions, it is regarded as the most promising 
intelligent material to emerge.

  [Text] Asahi Ciba, a joint-venture company of Asahi 
Chemical Industry and Swiss Ciba-Geigy, announced on 20 
September 1993, that it would transfer the complete control of 
sales from its parent companies and would be involved in the 
total operation of the company, from development and production 
through sales. Through this reorganization move, the company 
hopes to gain the competitive strength necessary in order to 
succeed in the epoxy business where competition among too many 
companies (over ten companies) are rapidly becoming overheated 
on the domestic market.... 
  Thus far Asahi Ciba has been producing epoxy resin at a 
35,000-ton plant located within the Asahi Chemical Industry 
Mizushima Plant. The amount of its annual sales is &yen;6 
billion. Until now, sales have been handled by Asahi Chemical, 
which sold epoxy resins under the product name of ``AER,'' and 
by Japan Ciba-Geigy, which sold the same product under the name, 
``Araldite,'' while Asahi Ciba has been involved only in 
production. Approximately 167,000 tons of epoxy resins are 
expected to be used in 1993, in coating and laminated plates, 
semiconductor sealing agents, and in adhesive agents. 
  The fact that an excessive number of both domestic and 
overseas epoxy resin makers, with [Toto Kasei] as a leading 
manufacturer, are competing for their share of the market 
intensifies competition. It is contributing to poor 
profitability, making things worse for every one involved. 
  As its restructuring move, Asahi Ciba has decided to 
establish an integrated business system. Under the new setup, 
Asahi Ciba has integrated within Japan Ciba-Geigy its R&amp;D 
Division and bolstered product development functions. Moreover, 
it has newly established a sales office in Osaka where the 
product will be sold under the name, ``Araldite-AER.'' The 
company's plan is to achieve the sales goal of &yen;10 billion 
by the year 2000.

  [Text] To boost its semiconductor sealing material 
business, Hitachi Chemical will raise the production of 
``mini-tablet type'' sealing materials, designed to match the 
size of ICs produced by customers, by 20&percnt;, and toward 
this end, 
the company is planning to increase this year the production 
lines for this product at Minamiyuki Plant (Yuki City), its main 
production base. This product will enable semiconductor makers 
to save time as it does not require molding. Moreover, it will 
minimize material waste, allowing manufacturers to economize on 
epoxy resins which currently are in short supply. Since 
production of powdered sealing material will be reduced, the 
ratio of the mini-tablet type will increase by from 40&percnt; 
to over 
50&percnt;. 
  There are three forms of semiconductor sealing materials, 
viz., powder, a large square tablet measuring a few centimeters 
on all sides, and a mini tablet in the size of an IC package. 
Semiconductor makers who use a powdered-form sealing material 
dissolve it before injecting it inside the IC package. With this 
method, some sealing material remains on the injection guide. As 
for the large tablet type, since its excess material must be cut 
off, it produces waste. Although the molding of the mini tablet 
requires an extra work, adding to cost, since it produces no 
waste, demand for it appears to be rising in recent months. 
  Together with Hitachi's affiliate, Hitachi Chemical 
Malaysia, 
the Minamiyuki Plant is producing 9000 tons of semiconductor 
sealing materials a year. By February 1994, the Minamiyuki Plant 
plans to install additional molding machines. 
  The explosion which destroyed the Sumitomo Chemical Ehime 
Plant (Niihama City) last July is creating concern for possible 
tightening of demand and supply of epoxy resin, a main raw 
material for semiconductor sealing materials. Following the 
example of Hitachi, which is reducing 20&percnt; of epoxy resins 
normally used, semiconductor makers will urge each sealing 
material company to implement efficient use of epoxy resins more 
in the future.

  [Text] Kawasaki Research (main office: 5-18, Higashi 
Koraibashi, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi; Toru Kawasaki, company 
representative; Tel: 06-949-3265), a survey and consultant 
company in high-tech fields, such as advanced materials, will 
conduct surveys on ``methods for developing the next generation 
of semiconductor sealing material'' using a multi-cliant method 
(particdipation of multi companies). In addition to the current 
situation concerning all-important epoxy resins, from the 
standpoint of recycling, the future possibility of thermoplastic 
engineering plastics will be covered. 
  The survey consists of those on ``situations in raw 
materials,'' ``recycling,'' ``packaging and its technology,'' 
and ``trends in device and material makers.'' Demand and supply 
of raw materials, compounds, and package, as well as technical 
trends, of all-important epoxy resins and fine ceramics will be 
surveyed, and, at the same time, the potentials and future of 
thermoplastic engineering plastic and liquid cryustal polymer 
(LCP) will be explored. 
  According to Kawasaki Research, the majority of 
semicondoctor 
sealing materials is made of high-purity novolak type epoxy 
resins, and, the annual world-wide consumption is said to range 
from 60,000 to 70,000 tons. Moreover, recently, underwater 
R&amp;D 
activities, dealing with environmental problems and recycling, 
have been gathering momentum. Especially, ``thermoplastic 
engineering plastic whose properties are good enough to replace 
epoxy resins and whose effective utilization is feasible, has 
begun to attract attention,'' according to the Kawasaki 
representative. 
  The survey will be put together as a report (A4, 200-250 
pages) and issued on 25 November 1993. The number of members 
invited to participate on the multi-client method basis is 10 
companies. The participation fee is &yen;500,000. Application 
for membership must be submitted by 10 October. After the number 
has reached 10, the company will stop receiving applications.

  [Text] The Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC) 
(Director, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries President Kosaku 
Inaba) has opened the ``Preparatory Office for Small Engines'' 
within JAEC in order to officially conduct a study for the 
development of small engines to be mounted on the 
next-generation small jet liner, the YSX. Planning Division 
Director Kuniyo Yamanaka of Aerospace Operation Headquarters, 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, has been selected as an 
acting director of the office. The work began with several staff 
members beginning preparations for the development/manufacture 
program and basic design. 
  Originally, the study of development of small engines for 
the 
75-seat YSX was conducted by engine makers such as IHI under 
contract from Japan Aircraft Development Corporation (JADC). 
When MITI switched its role as a contractor to a supporter after 
FY91, JAEC ended up taking charge. JAEC has conducted a 
feasibility study on overall plans for engine design, cycle, and 
structure/weight, and has completed the small engine design 
concept. 
  Intending to promote international efforts to develop the 
engines, JAEC presented their concept paper to major U.S. and 
European engine manufacturers for comment. JAEC has conducted 
market surveys in the United States and Europe and technical 
evaluation of engine performance and configuration as they 
pursued and upgraded the program, which started in FY91, in both 
FY92 and FY93. In addition, they have held discussions with 
engine manufacturers in the United States and Europe, as part of 
their effort to internationalize the development program. 
  Decisions have been made on the technical concept and 
partner 
selection, on the other hand, on the airframe development 
program. The Preparatory Office was established to expedite 
development of the engine area to a level which corresponds to 
the progress made on the airframe program. MITI has requested 
&yen;200 million in the FY94 budget for the small engine 
development study. JAEC will assign the Preparatory Office to 
conduct a study in FY94 of the development/manufacture program 
and basic design.

  [Text] Heat ray control paint for space use developed by 
Nippon Paint Co., Ltd. to control the temperatures of the 
surface and interior of satellites has been certified for the 
first time by the National Aerospace Laboratory as the official 
paint for common parts used in space. Two types of products are 
available for antennas and sensors. They are scheduled to be 
used for the largest domestically produced satellite, the 
``ADEOS,'' scheduled for launch in 1996. If production costs are 
reduced, many predict that it can be used for automobiles and 
the interior of buildings to control temperature increases. 
  Nippon Paint has developed two types of heat ray control 
paint for antennas by using basic paint material containing 
silicon resin, the ``NOVA 500 ASTRO WHITE'' (registered name), 
and for equipment by using basic paint material containing 
urethane resin, the ``NOVA 500 ASTRO BLACK'' (registered name). 
  The company states they have independently developed a 
special white pigment for antennas to control solar energy 
absorption. By adding this pigment to the paint they have 
achieved a solar energy absorption rate of about 0.26, and a 
solar energy vertical radiation rate of about 0.88 for the 
antenna which controlled the surface temperature to about 
120&deg;C; the unpainted antenna would have reached nearly 
500&deg;C. Also the new paint is high in elasticity, and 
therefore will not crack even when exposed to big differences in 
temperature. Addition of inorganic special ultraviolet absorbant 
also increases weatherability. 
  On the other hand, paint for use on equipment such as 
sensors, receivers, and recorders mounted on satellites has the 
function of irradiating outward the heat rays emitted by 
equipment on board. Details of the technology have not been 
disclosed, but the key to their success lies in the new 
synthesis of a special elastic urethane resin which is excellent 
at heat radiation. Approximately 0.89 of the vertical radiation 
rate for solar energy was achieved. 
  The company solved the problem of paint gasification by 
developing a technology to remove that portion of the resin with 
low molecular weight. If not so treated, elements of the paint 
film are gasified and given off during formation under a vacuum.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) has decided to cancel as of 1 April 1994 the development 
of the 150-seat next-generation mid-size passenger aircraft, the 
``YXX.'' MITI has been conducting a feasibility study jointly 
with the United States on the aircraft. MITI will soon send this 
message to their project partner, the Boeing Company, and 
expects to receive agreement. This is because Boeing had 
received an order for 63 ``737X'' aircraft from a U.S. aircraft 
company, and therefore decided to develop the ``737X,'' which 
has the same number of seats as the YXX, in preference to the 
YXX. Therefore the project could not possibly be continued. MITI 
had promoted the next-generation small passenger aircraft, the 
YSX and the YXX as two major projects for fostering the Japanese 
aircraft industry. The YSX will be the only project from now on. 
  The YXX project started in 1984 as an international joint 
development project with the Boeing Company. A U.S./Japan 
bilateral memorandum was signed in 1986. The memo stated that 
Japan would be responsible for 25 percent of the project. Both 
sides have so far prepared marketing surveys and operational 
arrangements, and conducted investigations of design technology. 
The development of new airframe structure design concepts 
including engines and main wings had been under way. 
  Meanwhile, Boeing has been studying the ``737X'' on their 
own 
in addition to the YXX for the development of next-generation 
mid-size passenger aircraft. The 737X is an offshoot of the 737 
aircraft, and therefore the fuselage and engine are similar. 
This is an advantage in terms of cost reduction. Boeing has 
proposed the 737X to aircraft companies. Southwest Airline 
responded by ordering 63 aircraft, and therefore Boeing decided 
to develop the 737X. 
  As a result, MITI has been holding discussions with the 
project's contact point, Japan Aircraft Development Corporation 
(JADC), and aircraft manufacturers. As long as Boeing has 
decided to put the 737X on their priority list, they have 
realized that it is not realistic to develop an aircraft that 
would compete with the B737X in the mid-size passenger aircraft 
market. In the meantime, they feel that Japan has gained enough 
technologies while developing the YSX and producing the B777 
under contract. Therefore, MITI will pursue an aviation policy 
that focuses only on the YSX.

  [Text] The Livestock Feed Central Research Laboratory 
(Tsukuba City, Ibaragi-ken) of the National Agricultural 
Cooperative Society Federation (Zen No) announced on 5 November 
that for the first time in Japan, a transplanted fertilized egg 
that can produce a cloned cow was separated and further recloned 
to produce second generation ``recloned cows'' successfully. It 
was a step forward towards accomplishing a technology to produce 
large numbers of genetically superior cows from one fertilized 
egg. 
  A clone is a living group that possesses identical genes in 
all respect. The cloning technology to produce such living 
groups have been actively studied for livestocks and the United 
States, in 1987, was the first in the world to succeed in the 
production of cloned cows. 
  In the case of cloned cows, after the cells in the 
fertilized eggs had divided into 16-32 pairs, they are separated 
and transplanted one pair each into another cow's egg in which 
the nucleus had previously been removed. The general procedure 
is to inject the transplanted egg into the cow's uterus. 
  Cows that are born by this procedure are first generation 
clones. However, the Livestock Feed Central Research Laboratory 
had tackled with a method in which the transplanted egg was not 
impregnated into a female cow but instead it was induced to 
perform a second cell division. From these cells, transplanted 
eggs were produced to form second generation cloned cows by 
impregnating into female cows. 
  In the technology of cloning, the repetition of recloning 
leads to inferior growth and conception rates for the 
transplanted egg as each generation is added. However, recloning 
was made possible at the Central Research Laboratory by using a 
certain type of test reagent that activate treats during the 
process of producing the transplanted egg. 
  According to the project leader, Tatsuo Onihara of the 
fertilized egg transplant laboratory, on 3 February of this 
year, the second generation transplanted egg was injected into 
the uterus of a female Holstein and later, the pregnancy was 
confirmed. Nine months later, on 5 November, a calf was born at 
1:30 PM by Caesarean operation. The calf weighed a normal 48 
kgms and was female. 
  In the United States, they have already been successful in 
producing third generation cows and furthermore, it is said that 
they are producing transplanted eggs for sixth generation 
cloning at the laboratory level. 
  Onihara project leader claims, ``In the future, it is 
possible that we will be able to produce infinite number of 
highly competent cows that can produce milk and meat.'' He will 
be presenting his research results at the International Egg 
Fertilization and Transplant Society Meeting to be held in 
Australia next January.

  [Text] Sumitomo Chemical Co. (Mr. Teruo Kosai, president) 
will full fledge enter into the bio-agricultural chemical field 
that will make full use of biotechnology. As a first shot, a 
bio-agricultural chemical that will suppress the growth of white 
flies will start selling in the United States during l994 and in 
Japan, it is intended to start its sale possibly as early as 
1997. At this point, with the background of the consumers safety 
goal in mind, bio-agricultural chemicals other than chemically 
synthesized agricultural chemicals are being actively developed 
especially in countries centering Europe. In Japan, sex 
pheromones and insecticides using natural enemy have been 
partially introduced, but in the future, the company will 
aggressively form a new agricultural chemical market in the 
field of bio-agricultiural chemicals that makes use of 
biotechnology. 
  The new bio-agricultural chemical to be marketed will act as 
prevention and removal of white flies by suppressing its growth 
by preventing skin shedding. Insects have hormones that enhances 
skin shedding and hormones that prevent shedding. With the new 
bio-agricultural chemical, the suppressing hormone is extracted 
and artificially synthesized. The scheme is to use this hormone 
to interfere in the white flies skin shedding. 
  The characteristics of the method is that unlike previously 
used insecticides which possesses powerful poison, it removes 
only designated harmful insects. Also, it is claimed that 
because it applies to its mode of life, the insects will not 
develop immunity as it does towards insecticides so there is no 
worry about losing its effectiveness. 
  White flies will proliferate by centering around green house 
cultivated plants such as green vegetables and tomatoes and also 
to the outdoor fields. It is a world wide problem and recently, 
many insecticides have lost its effectiveness due to immunity. 
  Sumitomo Chemical Co. has already registered in South Africa 
and in parts of the Middle and Near Eastern countries where they 
have started test marketing. Full fledge marketing will start as 
soon as a permit is obtained from the United States in 1994. 
Also, presently, application is being submitted in Japan and if 
all goes well, marketing will be possible in l997. 
  Looking at the bio-agricultural chemical market world wide, 
it is said that it comprises about 5&percnt;of the total 
agricultural 
chemicals, but by the year 2005, it should expand to about 12 to 
30&percnt;. Domestically, bio-agricultural chemicals are being 
developed such as sex pheromones that can disturb insect 
copulation and others that use natural enemy to remove notorious 
insects. At the present, bio-agricultural chemicals have not 
been accepted widely due to regulations over conditions of 
usage, and from the users side, there still exists the image gap 
between insecticides and the bio-chemicals.

  [Text] The National Institute for Environmental Studies 
(Mr. Toshinobu Ichikawa, head) of the Environmental Agency, 
presently, held an opening symposium in honor of the newly 
constructed Environmental Genetic Engineering Lab wing. In 
recent years, the technology in gene rearrangement has shown 
remarkable progress. It is in such technology that much is 
dependent on producing microorganisms and plants that can be 
applied to preserving the environment. The symposium consisted 
of lectures, research reports, and panel discussions by 
experienced scholars in genetic engineering. Debates in depth 
were made on the applications of microorganisms and plants 
towards environmental preservation and the values it held for 
environmental influence. 
  A keynote lecture titled ``We are depending on the genetic 
engineering technology for plants'' was given. Professor Akira 
Watanabe of University of Nagoya, Bio-Molecular Question &amp; 
Answer Research Center said, ``The genetic engineering 
technology centered around the field of food application has 
progressed. With the completion of the laboratory wing, we are 
depending on the exploration of new fields in the genetic 
engineering technology''. 
  The research presentations continued with ``The development 
of plants that can resist air pollution'' (Kuro Kondo, ditto 
Research Center, New Bio Product Evaluation Study Team Aggregate 
Research Official), ``The purification of trichloroethylene 
pollution using microorganisms'' (Osami Yagi, ditto Research 
Center, Water Environmental Quality Research Project Leader), 
and four other research reports on the present state of 
biotechnology in environmental preservation were presented. 
  In addition, in the panel discussion of ``The public 
acceptance of microorganism utilization for environmental 
control'', the degree of public penetration of genetic 
engineered bio-products that are on the market and also 
biotechnology itself were discussed. It has been generally 
acknowledged that our countrys knowledge of biotechnology has 
been affirmative and interesting comments from the panel such as 
``In Japan, we do not see as much resistance to products that 
have been genetically engineered as in Europe or the United 
States. Also the oppositions are not as philosophical (as the 
Europeans)'', and ``Dont forget that Japan was the first country 
to use genetically engineered detergent'', were being reported.

  [Text] A new macromolecular particle that can be used as a 
``carrier for drugs'' so that anticancer drugs can be 
transported exactly to the target inside the body has been 
developed by the joint research group of Tokyo Womens Medical 
College and Science University of Tokyo. The particle does not 
easily dissolve in living bodies and it can envelop internally 
any drug as long as the drug has the characteristic of repelling 
water. It is expected to help increase the types of drugs that 
can be used in the DDS (drug delivery system) which is 
attracting attention as a new pharmaceutical technology. 
  The developers were groups from Mr. Mitsuo Okano, Assistant 
Professor of Tokyo Womens Medical College, Engineering Research 
Facility for Medical Usage and Mr. Kazunori Kataoka, Assistant 
Professor of Science University of Tokyo, Basic Engineering 
Section. When macromolecule chain composed of hydrophobic group 
which is water insoluble and hydrophilic group which is water 
soluble is reacted with water, the hydrophobic portion of the 
chain will aggregate and this characteristic hydrophobic bonding 
is what has been used. 
  First, the macromolecule chain that connects the string like 
hydrophilic macromolecule polyethylene oxide and hydrophobic 
polyamino acid is dissolved in an organic solvent and to it, a 
hydrophobic drug is added. When this is gradually transferred 
into water solution, the string portion of the hydrophobic group 
will aggregate as the drug is taken in while the surface becomes 
covered with the hydrophillic chain as it produces a 
macromolecular particle (micelle). 
  Since the drug is physically wrapped by the particle, the 
technology will apply to any drug as long as it is hydrophobic. 
In the past, there has been macromolecule micelles that have 
been formed from chemically bonding the drug to the string 
portion of the hydrophobic section. 
  However, if the drug does not have the amino group to form a 
chemical bond, it would not be able to enter the micelle. Many 
of the anticancer drugs are hydrophobic and it is said that this 
development will broaden the area of DDS application. 
  The surface of the macromolecular micelle is hydrophilic so 
that it attaches to the living body with ease and will not 
readily be destroyed by the immune cells in the blood system. 
The special structure called aggregates characteristically has a 
more stable existence compared to liposome which is made from 
artificial lipid membrane and also has expectations of being 
useful as DDS. Furthermore, the size of the particle has a 
diameter of 30-50 nanometers (one nanometer is one hundred 
millionth of a meter) and it can easily pass through the cancer 
cell blood vessels and it is said that it has a tendency to 
gather at the site of the cancer. 
  Experimentally, the anticancer drug, adriamycin was 
physically inserted to form a macromolecule micelle, then added 
to cultivated cancer cell and during ten days, it was confirmed 
that the anticancer drug was slowly being released. The 
effectiveness of the anticancer drug was said to be 
approximately the same as when adriamycin alone was reacted. Up 
to now, the research group has produced macromolecular micelle 
that contains indometacin that is being used as an 
anti-inflammation drug.

  [Text] JAC Company (Main office, Fukuyama City, 
Hiroshima-ken, Shintaro Takenaka, president, capital 430 
million) which is developing a waste treatment machine for ship 
loading has announced on 15 November that they have developed a 
waste treatment machine jointly with the No. 6 District Maritime 
Safety Headquarters, Maritime Safety Agency, that is a 
biotechnology commanded raw waste treatment that at a glance 
appears as if the waste disappears. During the decomposition of 
waste, no carbon dioxide nor water is exhausted and the waste 
itself is decomposed into micron units which makes it appear as 
if the waste had disappeared. This type of waste treatment 
machine is the first in the world. The Company is applying for a 
patent on this waste decomposition method. 
  The decomposition of waste is performed by mixing the waste 
with decomposition cultivator that looks like wood chips and the 
moisture from the raw waste causes a chemical reaction leading 
to decomposition into tiny particles. A large size decomposition 
machine that would treat 20 kgms of raw waste would be 1 m 20 cm 
wide, 1 m 8 cm high and 1 m 10 cm deep and completely made from 
stainless steel. Compared to the existing waste treatment 
machine, no water or organic solid residues remain and the 
decomposed particles soak into the decomposition cultivator 
making it appear to the eye as if the waste had disappeared. 
Past experiments have shown that egg shells have decomposed in a 
week. ``It is most appropriate for a crammed ship that will be 
sailing for over a month'', was quoted (The Co.). The desired 
retail cost is 44 million. A smaller machine that would treat 
one kgm would cost 499 thousand.

  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Though electric power is essential in our present lifestyle, 
as energy consumption increases, frequent reliance on fossil 
fuel energy for power has led to problems such as destruction of 
the global environment and the pollution of urban environments. 
Thus engines for power generation that prevent these problems 
are needed. Crucial to this end is the ability to reduce exhaust 
emissions themselves through the use of motors with good heat 
efficiency, and the ability to further reduce global 
environmental pollution from exhaust through the use of clean 
fuels. 
  Currently, low-speed, two-stroke diesel engines exhibit the 
highest heat efficiency among commercial heat engines, and LNG 
is the most promising clean fuel. However since conventional 
diesel engines were built to run on liquid fuels (light and 
heavy oils), advantageous use of clean fuels has not been 
achieved. 
  Amidst the trend of energy resource diversification, since 
1978 we have been developing a novel engine, the Mitsui 
Gas-injected Diesel Engine (GIDE), that allows the use of 
natural gas with heat efficiency and output efficiency akin to 
that of conventional diesel engines. In 1985, as part of the 
Western Australia LNG Project, a gas fueled Mitsui MAN-B&amp;W 
6L35MC-GI low-speed, two-stroke GIDE was successfully 
demonstrated in public. For the first commercial model, 
gas-related parts for the Holeby 16V28/32-GI (3.52 MW) 
medium-speed diesel engine were also jointly developed with 
MAN-B&amp;W Diesel, Inc. (MBD) and entered commercial operation 
in 
Denmark in May, 1991. 
  The Mitsui MAN-B&amp;W 12K80MC-GI-S introduced here is the 
world's first large-scale, low-speed, commercial GIDE in which 
gas injection technology we have developed on the basis of the 
foregoing technology and experience is applied to a large-scale, 
low-speed diesel engine licensed by Mitsui in conjunction with 
MBD. 
  With a single unit output of 40.7 MW and gross thermal 
efficiency of approximately 48&percnt;, the engine also possesses 
world class output and peak heat efficiency among current 
power-generating diesel land engines and is naturally the 
world's largest gas-fueled engine. 
  Testing and research facilities making use of the engine are 
now under construction at Mitsui's Chiba site with anticipated 
completion in July, 1994. Plans call for development of 
low-speed, gas-injected diesel engines and development and 
trials of land power plant-related technology, including 
high-efficiency scrubbers (SCR) for removal of NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt; 
from exhaust. 
  A structural description of the engine and an overview of 
testing facilities are given below. 
<H5>  2. Advantages of Gas-injected Diesel Engines </H5>
  MC-GI engines are based on Mitsui MAN-B&amp;W L/S/K-MC 
engines, 
for which considerable practical results exist, and represent 
enhancements of an engine capable of efficient use of gas fuel 
as a primary fuel. These engines derive the following superior 
advantages from their use of so-called diffused combustion 
systems in which, unlike conventional (low pressure) gas-fueled 
engines, high pressure gas fuel (250-300 bar) is injected 
directly into the cylinders, ignited by a small amount of pilot 
fuel injected nearly simultaneously, and consumed. 
  (1) Achievement of diesel engine-equivalent heat efficiency 
and output efficiency at virtually all load regions. 
  (2) Excellent responsiveness to load variance. 
  (3) Excellent structural safety eliminating internal leakage 
of gas fuel into scavenger chambers during the compression 
stroke. 
  (4) Capability for both a wide range of multifuel combustion 
of gas and heavy oil fuels, and monofuel combustion of heavy oil 
fuels. 
<H5>  3. Engine Construction </H5>
  In GI conversion of MC engines, MC engine parts with 
demonstrated reliability and durability are used without 
modification as principal structural parts of the engine and 
structural parts of combustion chambers. Only the following 
parts are added or partially modified. 
  In other words, the engine is of proven safety and 
reliability. 
  Figure 1 and Figure 2 show, respectively, a vertical cross 
section and an outline view of the engine. Table 1 gives 
principal data for the engine.

  Figure 3 (not reproduced) shows the engine layout with a 
focus on the gas fuel supply system. 
  Gas fuel is supplied to the gas compressor under medium 
pressure, raised to a pressure of 250-300 bar, and directed to 
the engine's main gas fuel pipes. By way of thin, flexible 
branch pipes, the fuel is then directed from the main pipes to a 
valve block in each cylinder attached to the side of a cylinder 
cover. Valve blocks are internally equipped with an accumulator 
to prevent a reduction in gas pressure during gas injection, 
various safety valves that comprise part of a safety apparatus 
described below, and a pressure converter. 
  Two gas injection valves per cylinder are provided at 
cylinder covers, and [gas] passes from the accumulator to each 
gas injection valve by way of a gas pathway inside the cover. 
  Gas injection valves are opened and closed by oil pressure 
raised by a control oil pump structurally identical to the fuel 
pump, and a safety apparatus described below ensures that gas 
fuel is injected only when pilot fuel has been injected. 
  Two pilot valves structurally identical to fuel injection 
valves for a diesel engine are provided at cylinder covers, and 
operation proceeds through these valves alone at load ranges 
during starting and at up to roughly 30&percnt;, but at higher 
load 
ranges, a small amount of heavy oil A is injected as a pilot 
fuel used to ignite the gas fuel. Two fuel regulating shafts are 
installed in the engine to control these two fuels, and the 
respective regulating shafts are driven by separate electrical 
actuators that operate under the instructions of a controller 
controlling the entire power plant. 
<H5>  4. Newly Developed Parts </H5>
  Major newly developed parts for use the gas-injected engine 
are described in detail below. 
  4.1 Gas Injection Valve 
  Figure 4 shows an assembled cross section. As seen from the 
figure, the valve has a previously employed spindle-type 
structure but differs from conventional fuel valves in the 
following points. 

  -  Regular supply of high pressure gas fuel. 
  -  Regular supply of sealing oil 
  -  Supply of control oil for spindle opening and closing 

    Specifically, in contrast to conventional automatic valves 
used with liquid fuels, 250-300 bar high pressure gas fuel is 
continually supplied around the gas spindle, and injection of 
gas fuel is therefore controlled by the increase and decrease of 
control oil pressure. When control oil pressure between the 
control oil chamber and the gas supply component of the spindle 
is not raised, sealing oil of somewhat higher pressure than the 
gas fuel is supplied in order to prevent the gas fuel from 
infiltrating the control oil chamber. Sealing rings are provided 
around the outside of gas injection valves to prevent leakage of 
the high pressure gas fuel. The material of these sealing rings 
has both adequate sealing properties in the relatively high 
temperature environment inside the cylinder cover and endurance 
versus sudden pressure changes. A double pipe structure equipped 
with drain holes both within gas injection valves and within 
cylinder covers prevents accidental leakage of gas fuel directly 
to the outside. 
  The structure of this gas injection valve is identical to 
that of injection valves for Holeby engines and the Mitsui 
MAN-B&amp;W 6L35MC-GI supplied for equipment testing in the 
Western 
Australia LNG Project in 1985, and has thus enjoyed substantial 
actual use. The functioning and endurance of this injection 
valve will also be further checked with a testing apparatus for 
the gas injection system alone. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-14A>             Figure 4. Cross Section of Gas Injection Valve </FIG>




  4.2 Cylinder Covers 
  Though the structure of the cylinder cover is identical to 
that of the cylinder cover used with the K80MC base engine, 
starting valves have been miniaturized and their position 
changed to accommodate a pair of gas injection valves and pilot 
valves. 
  Gas injection valves provide capability ranging from a 
minimum injection quantity corresponding to an approximate 
30&percnt; 
load to a maximum injection quantity covering the rated load, 
but because this engine is used to drive a land power plant, 
pilot valves consist of fuel valves with the capability to 
handle only low load ranges extending through starting and 
conversion to gas fuel operation. 
  The double pipe structure concept has also been applied 
within the cylinder cover, in the provision of gas drain holes 
and holes that supply gas to gas injection valves. 
  Valve blocks are bolted to the camshaft side of cylinder 
covers. 
  4.3 Valve Blocks 
  Figure 5 shows an assembled cross section of a valve block. 
Within a valve block are provided a large capacity gas 
accumulator, emergency cutoff valve, emergency release valve, 
gas release valve internal to the accumulator, check valve, and 
pressure transducer for monitoring gas pressure within the 
accumulator. 
  The volume of the accumulator is sufficient to allow gas 
injection with combustion unimpaired simply by the expansion of 
gas fuel accumulated during one stroke, supply of gas from 
branch pipes until the next injection begins, and maintenance of 
a constant gas supply pressure. Gas fuel from the branch pipes 
of each cylinder passes through the check valve provided at the 
accumulator inlet, enters the accumulator and, during normal gas 
operation, is directed from the emergency cutoff valve to gas 
holes within the cylinder cover. 
  When gas operation ends, the emergency cutoff valve closes 
and the emergency release valve simultaneously opens and 
immediately releases gas fuel within the cylinder cover into gas 
drain pipes. A backflow of gas contained within the accumulator 
by the check valve is released into the gas drain pipes by the 
gas release valve, and the release of gas fuel from around the 
engine is completed. 
  A safety apparatus is also provided such that if the gas 
valve spindle should stick in the open position, or other 
abnormalities occur, the pressure transducer used to monitor gas 
pressure within the accumulator detects an abnormal drop in gas 
pressure, valve operations identical to those at the end of gas 
operation are carried out, and abnormal gas flow into cylinders 
is kept to a minimum. 
  Gas fuel sealing components, like other parts, are all of 
double seal construction. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-15A>             Figure 5. Cross Section of Valve Block </FIG>




  4.4 Gas Supply Pipes 
  Engine gas pipes are all of double construction and consist 
of main supply pipes, main drain pipes, and branch pipes that 
connect both sets of main pipes to the valve block of each 
cylinder. During gas operation, ejectors provided at double pipe 
outlets continually ventilate the double pipe spacing so that 
its pressure is lower than that of the engine room. 
  The ends of main gas supply pipes are equipped with check 
valves and connected to (nitrogen gas) purge lines. 
  As shown in Figure 6, the main pipe internal to the double 
pipes is supported from the outer pipe at three points to allow 
free sliding in the axial direction, which counters mechanical 
oscillation and differences in deformation of the inner and 
outer pipes due to thermal expansion. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-16A>             Figure 6. Gas Supply Pipe </FIG>




  4.5 Fuel Pumps and Fuel Regulating Shafts 
  Figure 7 shows the location of a pilot oil pump and a 
control oil pump. 
  The pilot oil pump provides the capacity required to handle 
injection at starting and up to an approximate 30&percnt; load. 
  Naturally, a normal K80MC fuel pump may be used when 
operation up to the rated load with heavy oil fuel is required, 
as with an LNG main ship's engine. 
  (tab)The control oil pump has the same basic structure as 
the fuel pump but has a tip constructed as a safety device to 
prevent the injection of gas fuel, as shown in Figure 8, if the 
pilot plunger sticks and pilot fuel injection pressure is 
insufficient; thus preventing a situation in which only gas fuel 
has been injected into a cylinder and remains uncombusted. 
  As shown in Figure 9, both pumps are controlled by 
respective 
fuel regulating shafts, and the fuel regulating shafts are 
driven by electrical actuators controlled by a computer that 
controls the entire power plant (or PPC; programmable process 
controller). 
  PPC-directed electrical actuator control is as follows. In 
pilot oil monofuel operation during starting and at low loads, 
only the pilot regulating shaft is controlled and the control 
oil regulating shaft is held at a zero position. When the 
instruction to begin gas operation is issued, control switches 
to the control regulating shaft and the pilot regulating shaft 
recedes at a constant speed to a preset minimum injection 
position where it is held.

<H5>     5. Safety Devices </H5>
  Preventing leakage of uncombusted gas fuel outside the 
engine 
room and cylinders is crucial for safe utilization of gas fuel. 
Equally important is the prevention of accidents through 
essential measures such as early detection of any leakage that 
does occur, stopping leakage before dangerous conditions are 
reached, and engine shutdown. To these ends, the following 
special safety devices are provided in addition to those 
included in typical engines. 
  Signals from these safety devices are all received by the 
PPC, which takes actions appropriate to operating status. Tables 
2 and 3 summarize major trouble and responses thereto.

  5.1 Cylinder Status Monitoring System 
  This equipment comprises the two functions of a component 
monitoring combustion gas pressure in cylinders and the device 
described in 4.3 which monitors gas pressure within gas 
accumulators. Among these, the combustion gas pressure monitor 
normally monitors the pressure within all cylinders and 
terminates gas operation mode if the compression pressure or 
maximum pressure of any cylinder greatly differs from the 
average for all cylinders. Devices monitoring gas pressure 
within gas accumulators operate as previously stated. In either 
case, the change in operating mode is rapid; the valve operation 
described in 4.3 is carried out within one stroke after 
detection. 
  5.2 Exhaust Gas Temperature Deviation Alarm 
  If operation becomes unreliable due to an inadequate gas 
injection valve seat seal or the like, a small amount of gas 
fuel will leak into a cylinder during operation. Since the 
exhaust gas temperature of that cylinder will rise above that of 
other cylinders, cylinder outlet exhaust gas temperatures are 
monitored, and a temperature deviation alarm terminating gas 
operation mode is triggered in such cases. 
  5.3 Pilot Fuel Injection Failure Prevention Apparatus 
  Gas fuel is not ignited by the rise in cylinder temperature 
produced by diesel engine compression alone. Thus a small amount 
of pilot fuel is required as a heat source for ignition and is 
injected into the cylinders before the gas fuel. However 
ignition will fail if the pilot fuel is not injected due to a 
stuck pump, malfunctioning intake valve, or bad pipe coupling 
connection or the like, and a risk of explosion in the exhaust 
receiver can result. The pilot fuel injection failure prevention 
apparatus noted in 4.5 is provided to prevent this situation 
from occurring. In addition to failed pilot fuel injection, this 
system also detects pilot spindles stuck in the open position. 
<H5>  6. Power Plants and Pollution Prevention </H5>
  When a diesel power plant is installed in a Japanese city, 
it 
must clear pollution regulations governing exhaust gas, warm 
discharge water, oscillation and noise, etc. Ichihara, Chiba 
Prefecture, in particular, where this test plant was installed, 
is a Specially Designated Regulated Pollution Area and the 
prefecture, city, and company have therefore agreed to special 
regulatory values. This equipment is designed to satisfy all 
regulatory values. 
  The adoption of LNG as a primary fuel makes sulfur oxides 
and 
soot in exhaust non-problematic, but considerable 
NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  exhaust from this high-efficiency engine itself 
requires special countermeasures. 
  Thus a catalytic reduction-type exhaust scrubber (SCR) is 
provided as shown in the conceptual view Figure 10. 
  In a 4-stroke engine produced in 1980, we introduced Japan's 
first plant combining an SCR and diesel engine and have 
considerable experience in the field. The development of such 
large-scale, high efficiency scrubbers is a world first. 
  In general, this type of scrubber is located in an engine 
supercharger backflow, but in the case of a large 2-stroke 
engine, the exhaust gas temperature in the supercharger backflow 
is below the optimal operating temperature range of the 
scrubber, which is therefore located between the engine and the 
supercharger in the current test plant. This location results in 
the denitration of high pressure gas, which is advantageous for 
allowing greater miniaturization than under atmospheric pressure. 
  Figure 11 shows a full layout view of the test plant.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-20A>             Figure 11. Full Layout View of Test Plant </FIG>





<H5>    7. Conclusion </H5>
  The GIDE introduced here is one solution to future 
environmental problems that stems from our experience and 
technical ability as the world's largest producer of 
large-scale, two-stroke, marine diesel engines. 
  The high heat efficiency of large-scale, two-stroke, 
gas-injected diesel engines (GIDE) themselves and the use of 
clean LNG as a primary fuel are expected to bring about future 
low-pollution power plants using these engines, especially in 
the form of large-scale plants suitable for suburban 
installation. 
  For this test plant, we plan long-term operation of several 
thousand hours per year designed to establish large-scale 
GIDE-related technology and reliability; looking forward as well 
to its utilization as a proven, large-scale GIDE power plant 
incorporating high-efficiency denitration equipment to counter 
exhaust gas.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  We seek to expand the use of solar-derived light, heat, 
water 
and wind power and other forms of natural energy in order to 
reduce our reliance on nonrenewable fossil fuel energy in the 
21st century. In a society with this orientation toward energy, 
we believe, as shown in Figure 1, that hydrogen, easily stored, 
transported, and converted to and from electricity, will play a 
crucial role as an energy medium, together with electricity 
produced from natural energy. Hydrogen is also converted to 
water when burned and can be used without disturbance to natural 
biosystems, while its convertibility with water provides a 
virtually limitless supply, as shown in Figure 2. Thus hydrogen 
is of interest as the ultimate fuel capable of providing 
long-term, mass quantity supply. A large-scale project aiming at 
Canadian-European utilization of electricity and hydrogen energy 
is already underway&lt;sup&gt; 1)&lt;/sup&gt;  as shown in Figure 3. 
  As depicted in Figure 3, automobile fuel is considered one 
of 
the main ways in which hydrogen will be used. 
  As one proposal for such, we prototyped the hydrogen rotary 
engine-equipped HR-X concept car (Figure 4) and showed it at the 
29th Tokyo Motor Show held in Fall, 1991. The HR-X attracted 
considerable public interest as a vehicle that will contribute 
to a clean, ecological world and was subsequently shown at other 
events around the globe, including the June, 1992 global summit 
on environmental problems in Brazil. The car is increasing 
awareness and anticipation of hydrogen vehicles. 
  In this paper, we discuss the background and objectives of 
hydrogen rotary engine (RE below) development, the advantages of 
using RE as hydrogen engines, the achievement of high output 
through a system for direct injection of hydrogen into cylinders 
(``direct injection'' below), and the results of our studies on 
emission characteristics, etc.

<H5>    2. Development Background and Objectives </H5>
  During the oil crises of the 1970s, hydrogen engines 
attracted the attention of specialists as alternative energy 
engines, and with the recent criticality of global environmental 
problems, they have again drawn attention from these quarters as 
clean engines. Research towards commercialization is continuing 
both in and out of Japan. 
  According to the basic characteristics shown in Table 1, 
hydrogen has a high calorific value, and if operated with the 
same amount of air and theoretical air/fuel ratio as a gasoline 
engine, the calorific value with a hydrogen engine will be 
15&percnt; 
higher than with gasoline, as shown in Figure 5. However, since 
the minimum ignition energy is a very low one-tenth that of 
gasoline, engine regions not hot enough to cause a problem in 
gasoline engines, such as spark plugs and exhaust valves, as 
well as residual exhaust gas, etc. become igniters and are 
believed to easily cause premature ignition, backfire, and other 
abnormal combustion. 
  Since premature ignition, backfire, and other abnormal 
combustion occurs readily in comparison to typical gasoline 
engines, research on conventional hydrogen engines has reported 
declining output performance or structural complexity caused by 
countermeasures, etc.&lt;sup&gt; 2)3)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  Noting that the distinctive structure of our proprietary RE 
were effective in preventing abnormal hydrogen combustion, we 
began development of hydrogen RE as clean, high-performance 
automobile engines designed to support a 21st century society

<H5>      3. Studies of RE Suitability For Hydrogen Combustion </H5>
  3.1 Goals 
  In general, reducing the temperature of sources of ignition 
is effective in preventing abnormal combustion in a hydrogen 
engine. For this, the hydrogen supplied and heat produced must 
be reduced in order to lower combustion temperatures, even at 
the cost of output. However, there are also examples in prior 
research on hydrogen engines of suppression of abnormal 
combustion without a reduction in hydrogen supply through the 
introduction of sodium-containing exhaust valves and a system 
for water injection within cylinders to cool sources of ignition. 
  Evaluation of hydrogen reciprocating engines (``CE'' below) 
predating hydrogen RE has shown a decline in output to roughly 
50&percnt; that of gasoline engines used for comparison. In 
hydrogen 
CE we evaluated, the causes thereof were shown to be restriction 
to a lean region with an excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.8 or more 
in order to prevent abnormal combustion, and a reduction of 
intake air due to the large volume occupied by the hydrogen gas 
fuel; both of which resulted in a reduction of heat supplied to 
54&percnt; that of a gasoline engine. Consequently, we consider 
these 
2 factors the main causes of the low hydrogen CE output. 
  In contrast, the working chamber in an RE revolves as shown 
in Figure 6, and the location where intake, compression, 
expansion, and exhaust strokes occur differs. We believe that 
the relatively low temperature of the working chamber during 
intake and this unique structure free of high temperature 
exhaust valves and the like are beneficial in preventing 
backfire. We investigated RE suitability for hydrogen based on 
the above theory. This section discusses measures taken against 
abnormal combustion, and the next section discusses measures 
taken against reduction in air quantity. 




    3.2 Experimental Apparatus and Method 
  A Mazda RE, model 13B (1,308 cc) and Mazda CE, model FE 
(1,998 cc) were used in experiments. 
  Figure 7 shows an overview of the RE experimental apparatus 
used. The air intake pipes and chamber were modified for 
hydrogen introduction based on mass production specifications. 
Fuel supply systems studied were a premix system supplying 
previously mixed air and fuel, and an intake stroke injection 
system supplying hydrogen only during the intake stroke, 
reportedly effective in preventing backfire in hydrogen CE. The 
premix system supplied hydrogen through throttle valve flow, and 
the intake stroke injection system supplied hydrogen through a 
dedicated hydrogen port provided in a side housing. Hydrogen was 
supplied to the engines from a commercial high pressure hydrogen 
cylinder (15.7 MPA, 7 m&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt; ) after pressure reduction 
to 0.5 MPa by a decompression device. As shown in Table 2, 
hydrogen port and air intake port timing initiated hydrogen 
supply slightly after intake began and terminated supply after 
air intake ended, 20 degrees of output shaft rotation later. 
  The CE fuel supply system used was a premix system supplying 
hydrogen through throttle valve flow. High tension cord 
shielding and narrowing of plug gaps (0.3mm) was carried out to 
prevent ignition by induced current, problematic in 
multicylinder engines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  3.3 Experiments 
  (1) Effect of Fuel Supply System 
  We studied the effects of differences in fuel supply systems 
on output limits. Figure 8 shows the results of a comparison of 
a premix system and an intake stroke injection system. Since 
output declines with mixtures richer than the theoretical 
air/fuel ratio (&lgr;=1), evaluation was made up to &lgr;=1. 
  Under full loading and with throttle valves fully open, a 
premix system RE was successfully operated at up to 5,000 rpm 
with &lgr;=1. However, output became unstable at 6,500 rpm, with 
&lgr;=1.4, and the excess air ratio (&lgr;) could not be reduced 
at 
higher speeds. In contrast, an intake stroke injection system RE 
was successfully operated at up to 6,500 rpm near &lgr;=1. We 
feel 
this is due to the production of non-uniform fuel regions with 
the intake stroke injection system, and a resulting weaker 
air/fuel ratio in mixture air near ignition sources than with 
premixing. 
  The following studies were made on the intake stroke 
injection system, superior in output. 
  (2) Effect of Spark Plug Heating Value 
  We investigated the optimum spark plug heating value for 
hydrogen. Spark plugs were those used with ordinary gasoline 
specifications; leading side spark plugs (``L plugs'' below) had 
a heating value of 5 (heating values follow product numbers of 
NGK Spark Plug Co. (Inc.)) and trailing side spark plugs (``T 
plugs'' below) had a heating value of 10. As the hydrogen 
quantity was increased from leanness, which inhibits abnormal 
combustion, premature ignition began to occur at an excess air 
ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6. Figure 9 shows indicator waves for the 
working chamber pressure when premature ignition occurred. 
Premature ignition first occurred noncontinuously, gradually 
occurring sooner and continuously, and finally occurring 
continuously in the migrating working chamber, [beginning] 
immediately after spark plug exposure during compression. From 
the course of this occurrence, we surmised that spark plugs 
become igniters, causing premature ignition which further raises 
spark plug temperature, increasing the frequency and quickening 
the occurrence of premature ignition. To verify this theory, we 
investigated the relationship between premature ignition and 
heating values by substituting spark plugs with effectively high 
heating values for the low temperature spark plugs. 
  As shown in Figure 10, the excess air ratio (&lgr;) at which 
premature ignition began declined after an increase in spark 
plug heating values from the gasoline-specification heating 
value of 5. As a result, we learned that normal operation is 
possible even at &lgr;=1 when heating values are raised to 13. 
Consequently, it became clear that spark plugs were the ignition 
source for the premature ignition in Figure 9, and that abnormal 
combustion can be avoided even at &lgr;=1 through the use of 
spark 
plugs with a high heating value. 
  In supplementary experiments, we found that the heating 
value 
of L plugs affected the occurrence of premature ignition. 










<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-25A>                 Figure 10. Effect of Spark Plug Heating Value on Premature </FIG>




  (3) Effect of Gas Escape From Plug Holes 
  Though the use of spark plugs with a heating value of 13 and 
the adoption of an intake stroke injection system for fuel 
supply allowed operation at &lgr;=1 over nearly all regions, 
instability did at times occur during maximum output at 6,500 
rpm near &lgr;=1. Accordingly, we investigated its cause using a 
pressure indicator diagram. 
  Figure 11 shows changes in the indicator diagram when 
instability occurred. Unlike Figure 9, sudden shifts from normal 
combustion to premature ignition are apparent. The absence of 
any signs of spark plug-induced premature ignition, and the 
passage of apex seals over L plug holes immediately prior to the 
occurrence of premature ignition led us to believe that mixture 
air uncombusted during the compression stroke passes through L 
plug holes, comes in contact with hot, burning gases during the 
expansion stroke, and is ignited. We felt that the size and 
volume of L plug holes would affect the occurrence of this 
phenomenon and therefore investigated the effect of changing L 
plug hole volume by changing L plug ejection quantities. As 
shown in Figure 12, we learned that the excess air ratio (&lgr;) 
during the occurrence of output instability can be reduced by 
increasing the ejection quantity; that is, by decreasing L plug 
hole volume.

  3.4 Combustion Performance 
  (1) Heat Efficiency 
  Figure 13 shows the relationship between net heat efficiency 
and air/fuel ratio at 1,500 rpm and respective loads of 
P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa and P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa. 
  For P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa, a peak was reached near &lgr;=3. 
Where heat efficiency is concerned, the leaner the mixture, the 
better for pumping loss and specific heat ratio, but isochorism 
declines and combustion deteriorates, and we believe that the 
balance of both sets of factors forms the peak. For 
P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa, throttle valves were fully open at 
&lgr;=2.5, and a peak net heat efficiency of 28&percnt; was 
reached at 
such time. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-26A>             Figure 13. Heat Efficiency vs. Air/Fuel Ratio </FIG>




  (2) Output Performance 
  Figure 14 compares hydrogen RE and hydrogen CE at 2,500 rpm 
through the relationship of excess air ratio (&lgr;) and output. 
  As the excess air ratio (&lgr;) falls, output increases. 
However the air/fuel ratio in the hydrogen CE could not be 
enriched above &lgr;=1.8 due to backfire. Higher output was 
obtained with the hydrogen RE, which allowed operation up to 
&lgr;=1. As a result, while only 50&percnt; of 
gasoline-specification 
output was obtained with the (premix system) hydrogen CE, 
63&percnt; 
and 75&percnt; outputs were obtained with the hydrogen RE premix 
and 
intake stroke injection systems, respectively.

  (3) Exhaust Gas Performance 
  Figure 15 shows the relationship between NOx and excess air 
ratio (&lgr;) at 1,500 rpm and respective loads of 
P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa and P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa. 
  For P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa, NOx are nearly zero above 
&lgr;=1.5; and for P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa, nearly zero above 
&lgr;=2.0. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-26C>             Figure 15. NOx Exhaust Characteristics </FIG>




  3.5 Results and Issues in Suitability Testing 
  The following was learned from our studies of RE suitability 
for hydrogen. 
  (1) RE show high performance in preventing backfire and can 
be operated at &lgr;=1 over a broad range if spark plugs with a 
heating value suited to hydrogen are used. 
  (2) While only 50&percnt; of gasoline-specification output 
was 
obtained with a premix system hydrogen CE, 63&percnt; of 
gasoline-specification output was obtained with a hydrogen RE. 
Additionally, 75&percnt; of gasoline-specification output was 
successfully obtained with the structurally simpler intake 
stroke injection system. 
  (3) High heat efficiency and clean exhaust gas is obtained 
under partial loading if operation is pursued at &lgr;=2-3. 
  From the above results, we found that hydrogen RE require no 
structural changes or attachment of special devices to prevent 
abnormal combustion near the theoretical air/fuel ratio capable 
of drawing maximum output; merely switching to spark plugs with 
a heating value suited to engine requirements is sufficient. It 
is thus demonstrated that RE possess a structure which is 
fundamentally easily adaptable to hydrogen engines, for which 
preventing abnormal combustion is the most important concern. 
  Nonetheless, the 75&percnt; of gasoline-specification output 
obtained even through operation at the theoretical air/fuel 
ratio is low. Likewise, since air and hydrogen are 
simultaneously injected by the intake stroke injection system we 
studied, air quantity during intake is reduced approximately 
30&percnt; by hydrogen volume, and volumetric efficiency is low. 
Accordingly, we report our study of a direct injection system 
designed to solve this problem by supplying hydrogen directly to 
cylinders immediately after completion of the intake stroke. 
<H5>  4. Development of Hydrogen RE Direct Injection Systems </H5>
  4.1 Goal 
  The decline in the volumetric efficiency of air that is the 
second cause of reduced hydrogen CE output depicted in Figure 5 
stems from the low density that is one hydrogen characteristic 
indicated in Table 1, and this characteristic is likewise a 
cause of reduced output in hydrogen RE. Specifically, low 
density gaseous hydrogen occupies a large 28&percnt; volume of 
total 
gas mixture in the theoretical air/fuel ratio, in contrast to 
the mere 1.7&percnt; occupied by gasoline vapor. And even when 
the gas 
mixture naturally input to a premix system, in which hydrogen is 
mixed in the intake pipes, is considered quantitatively the same 
as that in a gasoline engine, the amount of air therein is far 
less, as shown in Figure 16. Counteractive methods for direct 
injection of hydrogen into the working chamber after completion 
of air intake have been researched&lt;sup&gt; 4)5)&lt;/sup&gt; , and we 
investigated their effectiveness in hydrogen RE. Since the 
volumetric ratio of air to hydrogen in the theoretical air/fuel 
ratio is 72:28, mixed gas volumetric efficiency might be raised 
to a maximum 138&percnt; if direct injection raises the 
volumetric 
efficiency of air alone to near 100&percnt;, as shown in Figure 
16. 
  We also studied the exhaust characteristics of hydrogen 
fuel, 
reported to be completely free from conversion to noxious 
substances. Water is essentially the only combustion product of 
hydrogen, but a certain amount of lubricating oil carried into 
the working chamber in an actual hydrogen engine is burned and 
produces trace amounts of HC, CO, and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; . 
Additionally, atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen bond in the high 
temperatures of the working chamber, forming NOx. Our studies of 
hydrogen RE included exhaust characteristics of these emissions. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-27A>             Figure 16. Quantitative Differences in Supply By Hydrogen </FIG>




  4.2 Experimental Method and Apparatus 
  In systems for direct injection of hydrogen, both low 
pressure direct injection (roughly 1 MPa or less) early in the 
compression stroke and high pressure direct injection (roughly 
8-10 MPa) late in the compression stroke have been researched. 
In low pressure direct injection, the long duration from 
injection to spark provides superior mixing with air, however 
high pressure direct injection allows injection immediately 
before the spark and prevents premature ignition. As clarified 
in the previous section, the basic structure of the RE easily 
allows prevention of premature ignition, thus the need for high 
pressure injection is slight, and we felt that low pressure 
injection involving a simpler apparatus was appropriate. We 
therefore prototyped a hydrogen RE with a low pressure direct 
injection system and studied improvements in output performance. 
  Figure 17 shows the structure and operation of the 
prototyped 
hydrogen RE with direct injection system. Atop a side housing 
where gasoline specifications locate an intake port is an air 
port for intake of air alone, and above that is an added 
hydrogen port. A poppet-type hydrogen valve opened and closed by 
the cam shaft is located in the flow of a hydrogen port opening 
on the wall of the working chamber for the intake stroke. As 
shown in Figure 18, hydrogen is injected into the working 
chamber for the compression stroke for an interval of 
approximately 90 degrees (main shaft angle) starting immediately 
after the end of air intake through the air port. In the left 
drawing of Figure 17, air is being drawn into the working 
chamber during the intake stroke, and the hydrogen valve is 
still closed. The right drawing depicts a point during the 
compression stroke at which the air port has closed, the 
hydrogen port opens, and hydrogen is being injected from the 
hydrogen port towards the air in the working chamber. The 
pressure of the injected hydrogen is 1.0 MPa or less. 
  To discern the effect of the direct injection system, we 
jointly studied a premix system supplying hydrogen to an intake 
manifold. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-28A>             Figure 17. Structure and Operation of Direct Injection </FIG>






<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-28B>             Figure 18. Timing of Air and Hydrogen Supply </FIG>




  4.3 Volumetric Efficiency 
  Figure 19 shows a comparison of a direct injection system 
and 
a premix system through the relationship between excess air 
ratio (&lgr;) and volumetric efficiency. 
  In the direct injection system, only air is input naturally 
from the intake port, while in the premix system, an air and 
hydrogen mixture is input naturally. The volumetric efficiency 
in both is roughly equivalent. The slightly lower air quantity 
in the direct injection system is ascribed to the effect of 
residual hydrogen in the channel from the hydrogen valve to the 
hydrogen port which is carried in during the intake stroke. When 
volumetric efficiency for hydrogen-air mixtures are compared, 
the difference between the direct injection system and the 
premix system grows with the richness of the mixture, and the 
direct injection system is approximately 20&percnt; greater at 
the 
theoretical air/fuel ratio. Thus we see that conversion to 
direct injection more strongly affects the premature ignition 
and abnormal combustion-determined operating threshold in 
hydrogen RE, where this limit extends to richness close to the 
theoretical air/fuel ratio. 
  Figure 20 shows volumetric efficiency for an air-hydrogen 
mixture versus engine speed under full loading. Conversion to 
direct injection increases volumetric efficiency 20-30&percnt; 
at all 
speeds. The volumetric efficiency of a hydrogen-containing 
mixture in a direct injection engine thus exceeds 100&percnt; at 
2,000 
rpm and above. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-29A>             Figure 19. Volumetric Efficiency vs. Excess Air Ratio </FIG>






<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-29B>             Figure 20. Volumetric Efficiency vs. Engine Revolution </FIG>




  4.4 Heat Efficiency 
  Figure 21 shows changes in net heat efficiency versus excess 
air ratio (&lgr;) during wide open operation at 2,000 rpm. 
Compared to the premix system, the net heat efficiency of the 
direct injection system is seen to deteriorate roughly 2&percnt; 
in 
the lean region near &lgr;=2, and approximately 1&percnt; near 
&lgr;=1. 
These results are thought to show deteriorating combustion due 
to conversion to direct injection. To compare practical heat 
efficiency, Figure 22 shows changes in net heat efficiency 
versus net mean effective pressure. The direct injection system 
is somewhat worse than the premix system under low loading, but 
conversely better under high loading. The reason is that the 
direct injection system, with its high volumetric efficiency for 
air, operates leaner than the premix system under an identical 
load. We therefore feel that the decline in heat efficiency due 
to richness becomes a benefit in the large range of high loading. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-29C>             Figure 21. Heat Efficiency vs. Excess Air Ratio </FIG>






<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-29D>             Figure 22. Heat Efficiency vs. Mean Effective Pressure </FIG>




  4.5 Output Performance 
  (1) Excess Air Ratio Characteristics 
  Figure 23 shows changes in net mean effective pressure 
versus 
excess air ratio (&lgr;) during wide open operation at 2,000 rpm. 
Net mean effective pressure peaks near &lgr;=1 for the premix 
system and near &lgr;=0.8 for the direct injection system. The 
excess air ratio (&lgr;) at which net mean effective pressure 
peaks is thought to be affected mainly by volumetric efficiency, 
air utilization, and thermal dissociation. In a premix system, 
as shown in Figure 19, a decline in net mean effective pressure 
at &lgr;&lt;1 is thought to result from a reduction in the 
volumetric efficiency of air. Since there is no decline in the 
volumetric efficiency of air at &lgr;&lt;1 in a direct injection 
system, we felt that a rich mixture benefiting thermal 
dissociation and air utilization would obtain peak values. In 
results, we obtained a 28&percnt; higher output with the direct 
injection system than the premix system at &lgr;=1, and 
35&percnt; 
higher at &lgr;=0.8. In conversion to direct injection under 
these 
conditions, there was likewise no occurrence of abnormal 
combustion such as backfire and premature ignition, problematic 
in hydrogen combustion in recipro engines. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-30A>             Figure 23. Mean Effective Pressure vs. Excess Air Ratio </FIG>




  (2) Revolution Speed Characteristics 
  Figure 24 shows the relationship of net mean effective 
pressure to engine revolution speed during wide open operation 
at the theoretical air/fuel ratio. As shown in Figure 20 on the 
previous page, the volumetric efficiency of the entire mixture 
in a direct injection system was highest, exceeding 100&percnt; 
at 
revolution speeds of 2,000 rpm and above and approaching 
120&percnt; 
at 6,000 rpm. This indicates that in engines adopting a fuel of 
a low density gas akin to hydrogen, conversion to direct fuel 
injection has an output-improving effect akin to that of 
supercharged systems using turbochargers, etc. That supercharge 
status is not achieved at 1,000 rpm is laid principally to the 
fact that air port timing in this engine is designed for high 
revolutions, and not enough air is taken in at low revolution 
ranges to achieve supercharging. Thus supercharging may be made 
possible at all revolution ranges if a variable timing air port 
is subsequently developed and incorporates timing matched to low 
revolution ranges. 
  The above-discussed studies showed that volumetric 
efficiency 
is increased by conversion to direct injection, and as shown by 
net mean effective pressure in Figure 24, that wide open output 
is greatly improved. As a result, the 63&percnt; output of a 
hydrogen 
RE with a premix system, as compared to gasoline specifications, 
was improved to 87&percnt; by a direct injection system, as 
shown in 
Figure 25.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-30C>             Figure 25. Comparison of Hydrogen Engine Output Performance </FIG>



  4.6 Exhaust Gas Characteristics 
  We ascertained that HC, CO, and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  produced by 
the combustion of lubricating oil carried into combustion 
chambers is a nearly constant, extremely low level of 1/100 or 
less that of gasoline engines regardless of the excess air ratio 
(&lgr;). Since a similar, dramatic reduction in CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  in 
particular is impossible as long as gasoline or other fossil 
fuels are used, this is one of the most valuable benefits of 
hydrogen engines. 
  Conversely, characteristics similar to those with gasoline 
engines were revealed for NOx, with an exhaust peak exhibited 
near &lgr;=1 and sharp reductions on the lean and rich sides, as 
shown in Figure 26. On the lean side, favorable for heat 
efficiency, NOx decline to a near zero level soon after an 
excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6 is exceeded. In typical gasoline 
engines, a practical operating threshold at these regions due to 
unstable ignition and combustion, torque variation, and rapid 
increase in HC and CO exhaust makes operation in lean regions of 
very low NOx problematic. With hydrogen RE, however, there is no 
risk whatsoever of increased HC and CO exhaust even in operation 
at very lean regions, and the experiments described below 
revealed that stable combustion can be maintained. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-31A>             Figure 26. NOx Exhaust Characteristics </FIG>




  The relationship between the excess air ratio (&lgr;) and 
combustion fluctuation rate was determined and the combustion 
stability of a hydrogen RE evaluated under operating conditions 
of 1,500 rpm and Pe=0.1 MPa. Combustion fluctuation 
rates were determined through calculation by equation (1) using 
pressure data measured within combustion chambers.

  As shown in Figure 27, the combustion fluctuation ratio 
increases slightly as the excess air ratio (&lgr;) grows, there 
is 
no sudden deterioration as in a gasoline engine, and 
commercially viable levels are achieved in a range of excess air 
ratio 1.6 through 5.0. We believe that such ignition and 
combustion stability in lean regions results from the fact that 
hydrogen ignites very easily and burns quickly, as shown in 
Table 1, Basic Properties of Hydrogen. Consequently, vehicles 
equipped with hydrogen RE allow lean combustion with an excess 
air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6 or more over a broad operational range. 
  Results of the above studies indicate that HC, CO and NOx 
emissions may all be expected to reach very low levels in the 
emissions of hydrogen RE-equipped vehicles. 
  Figure 28 shows a comparison of NOx exhaust characteristics 
in a premix and a direct injection system. Peak NOx values were 
approximately 30&percnt; higher for the premix system, but NOx 
exhaust 
was somewhat greater for the direct injection system on the lean 
side and the rich side, where exhaust quantity was minimal. We 
believe that this narrowing of differences in NOx exhaust 
quantity versus excess air ratio (&lgr;) after conversion to 
direct injection results from increased non-uniformity of the 
excess air ratio within combustion chambers due to incomplete 
mixing.

<H5>    5. Conclusion </H5>
  Here we summarize the benefits held by RE when hydrogen is 
adopted as an automobile fuel. 
  (1) RE have a structure suited to hydrogen combustion and 
allow prevention of abnormal combustion through the mere use of 
spark plugs with a high heating value for operation at the 
theoretical air/fuel ratio. 
  (2) Wide open output can be increased 20-30&percnt; by 
conversion 
to direct hydrogen injection. A direct injection system hydrogen 
RE can thereby provide approximately 90&percnt; of gasoline RE 
output. 
  (3) HC CO, and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  quantities in hydrogen RE 
emissions are all extremely small. NOx are also minute in lean 
combustion, and automobiles with quite minimal exhaust can be 
produced through fine control of the air/fuel ratio during 
operation. 
  The results of our investigations have shown that fine fuel 
control, methods for mixing hydrogen and air, and other 
unrealized improvements to gas fuel for hydrogen RE hold 
adequate performance for automobile engines supporting a 
hydrogen-using society of the 21st century.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The characteristic of recent demand for electric power is 
that while demand for the maximum level of power is increasing, 
the amount of electricity in demand is not increasing 
proportionately (Fig. 1). For instance, the demand for the 
maximum power in the area supplied by Tokyo Electric Power for 
1991 was 1.9 million kW, an increase of approximately 
5.3&percnt;. 
while an increase in the amount of electricity used was no more 
than 3.5&percnt;. This is reflected in the load factor expressed 
in 
terms of facility use efficiency, which was reduced to 
5.5&percnt; in 
1991. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-32A>             Fig. 1. Growth in Maximum Electric Power and Amount of </FIG>




  As for the maximum electric power, in spite of the 
recessionary time brought about by the collapse of Japan's 
bubble economy, demands still are climbing, recording 4.1 
million kW (a 4.2&percnt; increase over the previous year's 
figure). 
  This is translated into an increase investment costs, 
putting 
pressure on management; in addition, it creates problems from 
the standpoint of efficient use of energy, as it reduces the 
efficiency of power generating facilities used to adjust loads 
for thermal and other forms of power generation. 
  Given this situation, in order to operate power generating 
plant and electric supply facilities efficiently, utility 
companies must level electric power load as much as possible. 
Since the only method of storing power currently in use is by 
pumping, the industry is hoping for a new storage technology to 
emerge. 
  With this as a background, since 1984, Tokyo Electric Power 
and NGK Insulator jointly have been developing a power storage 
system, utilizing a sodium-sulfur battery. Since the NaS battery 
has a higher energy density compared with those of traditional 
batteries, it can be produced in compact size and installed in 
metropolitan suburbs. 
  In terms of its capabilities, our R&amp;D effort was able to 
produce satisfactory results. Based on this new technology, we 
developed a 50kW battery for the practical prototype equipment 
and began its validation test in November of last year. This 
report, then, will deal with the 50kW NaS battery, focusing on 
its properties. 
<H5>  2. Summary of NaS battery </H5>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-33A>             Fig. Structure of Single NaS Cell </FIG>




  As shown in Fig. 2, the NaS battery largely consists of 
three 
parts, viz., active sodium and sulfur materials and an 
electrolyte and a separator, &bgr;'' alumina. &bgr;'' alumina is 
a 
fine ceramic through which only NaS ions can pass, and unlike 
ordinary batteries, it is made of a solid electrolyte; hence it 
does not discharge by itself. Moreover, sodium and sulfur used 
as active materials have a high Clark number and are available 
in abundance. as resource. 
  Since they normally must operate at high temperature of 
300-350&deg;C, they are collected in an insulated container and 
used in a module form. Temperature control inside the container 
is performed by an electric heater. 
  Since open voltage near the charge end is 2.08 v., during 
discharge, sodium ions move through the solid electrolyte to the 
positive electrode, and during discharge, the reverse process 
takes place. At that time, it is possible to convert 96&percnt; 
of 
change in entropy into electric energy. The remaining 4&percnt; 
is 
taken out or taken in in the form of heat. Heat generation takes 
place during the course of discharge and heat absorption during 
the course of recharge. The theoretical energy density expressed 
in weight is 786Wh/k.g. and in mass, 1008Wh/l. Compared with 
traditional batteries, it has much higher energy density.

<H5>  3.1. Development Goals and What Thus Far Have Been Achieved </H5>
  Our present goal is to achieve in the battery the level of 
electric storage capability equal to that achieved by a pumping 
method, and toward this end, we have developed the necessary 
specifications. Criteria used for index are durability, 
efficiency, cost, and safety. (Table 2).

  Thus far, we have been able to achieve our performance 
target; the main problem now remaining is that of cost. 
<H5>  3.2. Validation Test Schedule </H5>
  The field test of the NaS battery began in March 1990 at 
Kawasaki Electric Power's storage-linked-system-test station. 
The test was conducted in 3 stages (Table 3). During the first 
stage (10kW/80kW/h), a battery grouping technology, designed to 
group a large number of small batteries into one module, was 
examined; during the second stage (100kW/400kWh), basic 
technologies involved in systematization, designed to combine 25 
modules to construct a system, were studied. 
  Testing of the 50kW battery, covered by this report, was 
conducted as a validation test. Our purpose is to validate the 
capabilities of the 50kW battery which will become a 
commercialized prototype equipment using 300Wh-class large cells.

<H5>  4. Performance Evaluation of 50kW/400kWh NaS Battery </H5>
<H5>  4.1. Characteristics of 50kW Battery </H5>
  The characteristics of the battery are as follows: 
  (1) A 50kW module will provide a basic structural unit of 
transportation and construction in the future in constructing a 
MW-class power storage system; and (2) By considering a 
simplified system when put into practical use, we opted for a 
simple construction involving only a few pieces of equipment. 
<H5>  4.2. Summary of 50-kW Battery System </H5>
  (1) Battery Specifications 
  We constructed the battery with the rated output of 50kW and 
storage volume of 400kWh by combining four 12.5kW submodules in 
line. As shown in Fig. 3, it has a four-layer submodule 
structure, achieving a high-energy density through the 
combination of a mass energy density of 73kWh/m&lt;sup&gt; 4&lt;/sup&gt; , 
weight energy density of 51kWh/t, and area energy density of 
185kWh/m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; . 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-35A>             Fig. 3. Structure of 50kW NaS Battery </FIG>




  One submodule houses 324 300Wh-class large single cells, 
which are linked as follows: 6 in series x 6 in parallel x 9 in 
series. Each string has a fuse attached, a structure designed to 
limit a damage, such as short circuit, to a minimum. As has been 
explained previously, since the NaS battery operates only at 
high temperature, the submodule is insulated by a vacuum heat 
insulation container, with internal temperature controlled by a 
heater at 310&deg;C. In order to measure temperature and to 
provide thermal control, 10 voltmetric wires and 4 thermocouples 
are [toridashite] from the battery. 
  A 1-cycle per day design, with 8 hours each allotted to 
recharging and discharging of the battery, resulted in a 
discharge/charge efficiency of 8.8&percnt; when a loss 
resulting from 
the use of a heater is included, the efficiency rate is 
8&percnt;.

  (2) Summary of Test System 
  The structure of the 50kWNaS Battery's validation test is 
shown in Fig. 4. Since the battery is DC (direct current), in 
order to link with AC (alternating current) commercial systems, 
it will be necessary to have a DC-AC converter designed to 
convert DC and AC currents in both directions. The battery is 
connected to AC 210V through the AC-DC convertor and to a rear 
distribution cubicle bus whose pressure is raised to 6.6kV using 
a transformer. Since the test system is an industry-owned 
electric utility facility, its link to the power system is 
implemented in accordance with the Agency of Natural Resources 
and Energy's ``Guideline for System Linkage,'' and because the 
condition includes reverse power flows, we used a dedicated line 
to link the test system to the distribution cubicle so that the 
test system cannot be operated when the power system is without 
voltage. 
  We used an FA computer to manage the total test facility. In 
order to control battery temperatures and voltage, we installed 
control equipment separately. 
  The 50kW battery systems arranged in parallel, on 9 November 
1992, passed a pre-operational inspection on December 10 and 
currently is in operation without any problems.

characteristics and long-range performance of the 50kW NaS 
battery as a prototype machine at the time of its practical 
implementation. Also examined will be its effects and a method

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-36B>             Fig. 5. 50kW Battery Constant Power Characteristics </FIG>




  (1) Characteristics of Constant Power Operation 
  Fig. 5 shows electric properties of the 50kW battery when it 
undergoes one cycle of charge and discharge at the rated output 
of 50kW (January 19, 1993, 56 cycles), as well as temperature 
characteristics inside a representative submodule (C submodule). 
We used the pattern of operations involving the cycle of 8-hour 
discharge, a 5-hour rest period, recharge until the battery had 
been fully charged (approximately 9 hours), and a 2-hour rest 
period. 
  Regarding the electric properties, when pure sulfur at the 
positive electrode is depleted, a decrease in the battery 
voltage from the certain level maintained at the time of initial 
discharge begins to occur uniformly for the most part. Since it 
is constant power operations, electric current increases when 
the maximum level is reached at the end of discharge. The range 
of voltage shift was between 382V and 471V, and that of current 
shift between 116A and 131A at the time of discharge and between 
118A and 105A at the time of recharge. 
  Although internal parts of the submodule are uniformly 
controlled at 310&deg;C plus or minus 2&deg;C during a standby 
period, the temperature begins to climb as a result of heat 
generated by internal resistance and by discharge reactions. The 
highest temperature registered at the center of the module is 
328&deg;C, while the lowest was 319&deg;C on the plug side where 
insulation performance was at its poorest, creating a difference 
of approximately 10&deg;C inside the submodule. 
  As soon as discharge has been completed, temperature began 
to 
fall gradually, especially in places where this was easily done, 
the temperature fell below 310&deg;C, making it necessary to use 
a heater. Ultimately, temperatures of all places inside the 
submodule fell down to 310&deg;C. It was verified that before 
the next cycle of discharge began, the unit will return to a 
standby state, thereby achieving good result insofar as 
achieving good temperature equilibrium is concerned. Since the 
module is constructed by layering four submodules, we were able 
to obtain the identical temperature characteristics in all 
submodules. (Table 5)

  We were able to obtain a 90&percnt; battery efficiency in 
1-cycle-a-day operations; even when a heater loss is taken into 
account, we were able to obtain a high battery efficiency of 
87&percnt;, much better than expected. 
  (2) Characteristics Observed during Continuous One-Week 
Operations 
  We evaluated the characteristics based on the basic 
operational pattern used in actual operations, viz., 
1-cycle-a-day recharge-discharge operations on weekdays, resting 
on Saturdays and Sundays. The operations followed a set pattern 
of 8-hour recharging with the rated current of 122A, a 3-hour 
rest period, 8-hour discharging and 5-hour rest period (Dec. 
14-20). 
  We obtained the battery efficiency of 90&percnt;, and, when 
a 
heater was taken into account, the efficiency was 83&percnt;. 
  (3) Stand-by Loss 
  During the 10-day period, 26 December 1992-4 January 1993, 
we 
continued to stop battery operations from time to time to 
measure energy loss brought about by the use of a heater in the 
standby unit. The total amount of electricity consumed by a 
heater during the ten-day period was 549.5kWh, an average of 
55kW (average electricity of the heater 2.3 kW) on a per-day 
basis. 
  Fig. 6 shows relationship between the highest external 
temperature and the amount of electricity consumed by a heater. 
Effects of temperature, however, were not observed.

<H5>    5. Summary and Future Issues </H5>
  Since the performance evaluation of the 50kW NaS battery has 
just begun, all we have only been able to accomplish thus far is 
to cover the battery's initial basic characteristics. Our plan 
is to continue with our validation test, evaluating the 
characteristics of the battery's long-range performance. 
  The main problem associated with the NaS battery which must 
be dealt with is that of cost. The materials used in this 
validation test are for the purpose of research only and not the 
kind of materials generally used in industrial production. Our 
plan is to work on cost reduction through lower material costs 
and the automation of mass production process.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In order to check the destruction of our global environment 
by a large amount of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions caused by mass 
consumption of fossil fuels and to revitalize the earth's 
environment, various measures are being proposed at present. Of 
these the most effective, in our opinion, will be a large-scale 
introduction of clean energy and development of an innovative 
energy conversion technology. Faced with the environmental 
crisis situation, we feel that development of a revolutionary 
technology designed to convert clean and inexhaustible solar 
light into energy will be extremely important. 
  Based on our judgment that hydrogen will become one of the 
main energy sources of the future, we have undertaken a project 
designed to construct a hydrogen manufacturing system utilizing 
a high-temperature vapor electrolytic technology combined with 
the use of solar radiation as a primary energy source. The 
conceptual diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-38A>             Fig. 1. The Conceptual Design of Hydrogen Manufacturing </FIG>




  One of the characteristics of this system is that, since it 
converts solar energy at 1000&deg;C, unlike the type of 
conversion occurring in a mid-temperature zone, we can expect 
high thermodynamic conversion efficiency. This system collects 
solar light in a solar collector, thereby generating high 
temperature of approximately 1000&deg;C. High-temperature 
electrolytic cells are heated by means of oxide solid 
electrolyte. This electrolytic system is intended to obtain 
direct current necessary for electrolysis through direct 
conversion of heat into electricity by using exhaust heat of 
approximately 700&deg;C produced during the latter stage of the 
electrolytic unit operation. In order to construct this system, 
it will be necessary to develop a component technologies such as 
solar concentrator, solar heat receiver, high-temperature 
electrolytic cell, and thermoelectric converter. 
  In this report, we will describe our experimental research 
in 
a thermoelectric power generator into which an FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
thermoelectric element (which uses as its heat source a 
high-temperature heat obtained from a large-scale solar 
concentrator) is incorporated. The concentrator is installed at 
Tohoku University. 
  2. Solar Light Concentrator and Solar Heat 
Receiver 
  A large-scale solar light concentrator which uses a rotating 
parabolic mirror with an aperture measuring 10 meters and focal 
distance of 3.2 meters is installed at Tohoku University. Energy 
input capacity of this concentrator is 50kW, and when a disc 
sample is placed on a focal plane, the degree of conversion 
becomes 50,000 times as great, making it possible for us to 
obtain super high temperature reaching as high as 4000K. 
  The temperature required for a hot vapor electrolysis is no 
more than 1000&deg;C, and, since an extremely high concentration 
of solar light is not required for this purpose, the solar heat 
receiver is designed to gather sunlight while defocusing on a 
8-cm diameter ceramic tube surface so as to obtain an adequately 
high temperature required for high-temperature electrolysis. The 
computational result of sunlight concentration distribution over 
the tube surface was reported at a research forum held last 
year, revealing that it was possible to obtain the maximum 
concentration level of 6000. This computed value is in good 
agreement with the distribution of solar radiation gathered on 
the tube surface obtained by actual measurement using a 
heat-flux meter. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-39A>             Fig. 2. Solar Radiation Receiver Made of Porous </FIG>




   In order to obtain high-temperature heat efficiently from 
concentrated sunlight, we have developed a solar receiver made 
of porous ceramics shown in Fig. 2. Our experiment in high 
temperature heat generation by the combined use of the solar 
receiver and a large-scale solar concentrator installed at 
Tohoku University already has been reported&lt;sup&gt; 1)&lt;/sup&gt; . 
Generation of heat stabilized at 1000&deg;C in the part, into 
which electrolytic cell is fitted, and at 800&deg;C in the part, 
into which thermoelectric power generation elements are 
assembled at a latter stage of heat generation, have been 
verified. 
<H5>  3. Development of FeSi </H5>
&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  Thermoelectric Power 
Generator Using Sunlight as Heat Source 
  As described in the previous section, it has become possible 
to obtain high heat of 800&deg;C stabilized at the latter stage 
of electrolytic cell unit operation with the use of the 
prototype solar receiver. We have, therefore, conducted R&amp;D 
of a 
system designed to generate power used in electrolysis through 
the direct conversion of heat into electricity utilizing 
thermoelectric elements which utilizes the high temperature of 
800&deg;C. 
  The performance of thermoelectric materials is evaluated by 
the performance index given by 

  &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  (&agr;, &kgr;, and &rgr; represent thermoelectric power, 
thermal 
conductivity, and electrical resistivity) SiGe and 
FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  are known as high-temperature-type power 
generating elements. Although the performance index of the 
FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermal power generating element is considered 
low, Matsubara and his team at Yamaguchi University reported 
recently that, by treating the FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  element in the 
oxygen plasma, they were able to produce a 
high-performance-index&lt;inf&gt; 2)&lt;/inf&gt;  FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
thermoelectric power generating element. As a result, this 
element is now attracting attention as a promising 
high-temperature power generating element material. Moreover, 
since a large number of power-generating elements are required 
in heat-electric direct conversion, element material cost must 
be low. From the standpoint of material cost, also, the use of 
the FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermoelectric power generating element 
will be welcome. For these reasons, in this research, we used 
the FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  element in our power generation experiment. 
  Photo 1 shows FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermoelectric power 
generating elements K and I. These are produced by different 
companies. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-39B></FIG>






<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-39C>                           Fig. 4. One K Element's Power Generation </FIG>






<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-40A>              Fig. 5. Gas Temperature in Each Block </FIG>




  Current-voltage and output characteristics of these single 
elements are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The reason why the output 
of I element is lower than that of K element is that its 
sectional area is smaller than that of K element, resulting in 
an increase in internal resistance. When the conversion, 
designed to make a sectional area of both elements to be in the 
same size, is performed, both outputs were approximately on the 
same level. Using these elements, as shown in Photo 2, we made 
an FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermoelectric power generator, designed to 
convert solar energy into a primary energy, and attached it to a 
lower part of the solar receiver. This generator consists of the 
first, second, and third blocks. Eight elements are attached 
around a stainless steel tube of each block measuring 6 cm in 
diameter and 2mm in thickness. The power generating element's 
cold junction part is fixed on a water-cooled copper plate. 
Photo 3 shows the way in which the interior of the power 
generator is viewed from the lower part. The power generation 
element's p-n junction is extruding in the central part touching 
a hot gas. It is clear that a space between the junction and the 
stainless steel tube is insulated by a heat-resistant blanket. 
In the first block, five layers of I elements, in the second 
block, six layers of I elements, and in the third block, four 
layers of K element, a total of 120 elements are attached. 
  We conducted a thermoelectric power generation experiment 
with sunlight focused on the solar receiver. In this experiment, 
we installed a thermocouple device in the center of the 
stainless steel tube and measured each layer's gas temperature. 
Fig. 5 plots shifting gas temperatures and power generating 
element's cold junction temperatures by time, indicating clearly 
the stabilized temperatures. The lower part of the first block 
has the highest temperature, and as we move upward, we see 
temperature gradually falling, which makes us think that a 
further study on insulation of the stainless steel tube side may 
be necessary. 
  We conducted power generation experiment by connecting 
blocks 
in series to measure current-voltage and output characteristics 
through resistance load. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The 
highest output was 2.7W. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-40B>             Fig. 6. Power Generation Characteristics of Thermoelectric </FIG>




  Fig. 7 (not reproduced) shows the relationship between 
electric current of high-temperature electrolytic cell made of 
solid zirconia electrolyte (covered in our study) and impressed 
voltage. Also shown in the diagram is a comparison of 
current-voltage characteristics of the thermoelectric power 
generator. We can see from the chart that even with this level 
of power generating capability, electrolysis progresses and 
hydrogens are being produced. In order to increase the amount of 
hydrogen generated, it will be necessary to increase power 
generator's output. The power generator's current-voltage 
characteristics indicate that high resistance existing inside 
this generator is curbing output growth. As shown in Fig. 8, an 
element developed recently has a different shape and has the 
capacity to generate nearly 1 W power. Incorporation of this 
type of elements into the generator will enable us to obtain a 
greater output capacity.

<H5>    4. Conclusion </H5>
  We have produced a highly efficient solar receiver made of 
porous ceramics. We were able to learn that, by heating this 
solar receiver with a large-scale solar concentrator installed 
at Tohoku University, the electrolytic cell and thermal power 
generating elements can be maintained at a stable high 
temperature. By using a power generator equipped with 120 
FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermal power generating elements, we have 
succeeded in producing 2.7W electric power. These results 
clearly state that experimentally it would be possible to 
construct the type of hydrogen manufacturing system based on a 
high-temperature vapor electrolysis using only solar energy 
(shown in Fig. 1) as its primary energy. Our future plans are to 
use FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  elements with low internal resistance to 
produce a power generator with the optimal heat design and to 
develop high-efficiency hydrogen generation system.

<H5>  Preface </H5>
  Effects of ever-increasing CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions upon 
global environment is generating worldwide debates. People are 
concerned by the fact that the automobile exhausts, considered a 
main offender in this regard, will continue to increase with the 
growth of GNP. In order to suppress CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions 
and to encourage people to use public transportation, it will be 
essential to promote widespread use of low-pollution vehicles. 
In carrying this out, we must be aware of the fact that 
batteries, serving as an energy source for electric vehicles, 
must be much larger in scale than existing ones, requiring 
greater amounts of resources. Consequently, in order to promote 
the wide acceptance of electric vehicles, it is necessary to 
construct a system designed to provide a stable supply of such 
component elements as batteries. For this reason, we surveyed 
the availability of material resources used to produce batteries 
and evaluated battery performance in actual use. Based on these 
data, we computed the required amount of resources from the 
standpoint of performance. Moreover, (3) we designed a model for 
battery supply system, and, based on this model, we calculated 
the amount of resource which will be consumed during a certain 
period and studied the feasibility of battery installation at 
the time when a large number of electric vehicles will hit the 
market. 
<H5>  2. Trial Calculation Method and Its Example </H5>
  At present, various types of promising batteries for 
automobile application are being proposed; however, for the 
survey, we focused on lead, nickel-cadmium, nickel, and 
nickel-zinc batteries because of their development status. 
  (1) Concerning these batteries, we first of all surveyed 
their electrode materials considered to have a tremendous impact 
on the number of sales of electric vehicles. Its findings are 
shown in Table 1. Since cadmium is a byproduct of zinc, zinc 
reserves are by no means plentiful, in addition to the fact that 
it will be difficult to provide a stable supply of these two 
metals when widespread use of electric vehicles should become a 
reality and large quantities of these materials are required. 
Moreover, lead and cadmium are toxic metals and should not be 
introduced into the environment. If we are to consider an 
additional problem of resource, then construction of a recycling 
system of these metals will be essential.

  (2) Focusing on performance demanded of a battery, 
especially 
its output density viewed from a vehicle's traveling speed, by 
adding a parameter for automobile's performance, we computed the 
amount of resource required per vehicle. The method of this 
computation is shown below. Also an example of the computational 
result is shown in Table 2. 
  A&lt;inf&gt; ijk&lt;/inf&gt; (N) : Based on N-year's battery performance, 
the amount of element i (t) required for an electric vehicle k 
equipped with a battery j (i, j, and k represent the type of an 
element involved, type of a battery, and the size of a vehicle - 
  i = lead, nickel, cadmium, iron, and zinc j = lead 
battery, Ni-Cd battery, Ni-Fe battery, and Ni-Zn battery k = 
large-size vehicle (approximately the size of a garbage truck), 
a medium-size vehicle (light van), and compact vehicle (about 
the size of an average passenger automobile)) 
  A&lt;inf&gt; ijk&lt;/inf&gt; (N) = (P / PD&lt;inf&gt; j&lt;/inf&gt; (N)) x 
X&lt;inf&gt; 6&lt;/inf&gt;  (1) 
  P :Output demanded of a battery (vehicle weight, 
traveling speed, air resistance, overall efficiency, etc. will 
be parametized&lt;sup&gt; 3)&lt;/sup&gt; ) 
  PD&lt;inf&gt; j&lt;/inf&gt; (N): Battery j's output density for N 
years 
  X&lt;inf&gt; ij&lt;/inf&gt; 
  :Weight ratio of battery j's element j 
  At this time, the battery's output density will be greatly 
changed and with it the amount of resource required. Actual 
vehicle's traveling pattern is complex. Since performance 
evaluation of a stand-alone single battery does not agree with 
that of a battery installed in a vehicle, further study on 
performance estimates will be required. As for computation 
examples shown in Table 2, in order to make comparison with 
computations based on standard capacity, we used output density 
based on general battery catalog performance&lt;sup&gt; 3),4)&lt;/sup&gt; . 
As for the lead battery, there is an example of computing the 
required amount of lead from a battery's weight energy density; 
however, judging from the result showing the 1,700-1,800 tons 
per 10,000 electric vehicles equipped with 40Wh-kg&lt;sup&gt; -1&lt;/sup&gt; 
batteries, we can see that an extremely rigid condition is 
imposed on the calculation arrived at from the output density.

  Based on the estimates in (3) and (2) and by parametizing 
the 
number of vehicles distributed and life-time and recycling rates 
of batteries, we calculated the amount of resource consumption 
shown in a recycle system model diagram of Fig. 1. The method of 
calculation is shown in the following equations, (2)-(5), and 
examples of the computational results in Figs. 2-4.

  Lead is frequently used in automobile batteries. At present, 
in more than 90&percnt; of cases, the Japanese use lead in 
batteries. 
As for its recovery, even in terms of the entire amount used, 
over 40&percnt; is recovered. Advanced recycling technology 
mostly 
likely will facilitate construction of recycling systems. 
However, at the present juncture, estimated reserves by no means 
are abundant. Moreover, since battery capabilities are reaching 
a saturation point, use of a large amount of lead most likely 
will be restricted. As for iron and nickel, we see no problems 
insofar as the availability of these material resources are 
concerned. For the supply of zinc and cadmium, however, we will 
have to depend largely on recycling if demands will begin to 
rise for greater quantities of these metals. Especially with 
cadmium, even if recycled, if an annual demand is for use in 
over several hundred thousands vehicles, there will be a danger 
of drying up its resource unless the mining of cadmium rock bed, 
which is not part of current commercial undertakings, is now in 
progress. However, since our estimates for resource requirements 
are extremely generous, actual usage ratio and drastic future 
improvements, viz., possible reduction in automobile body 
weight, will contribute to lowering of our resource 
requirements, thereby heading off the depletion of resources to 
some extent. Although recovery and recycling of nickel-cadmium 
batteries are being undertaken recently, these are yet to be 
recycled to produce new batteries. Figures 2 and 3 indicate that 
at the level of approximately 1 million vehicles, since use of 
elements other than cadmium is directed more in products other 
than electric vehicle batteries, new production of elements for 
use in batteries does not increase an overall annual production 
figure greatly . However, in view of the scarcity of mineral 
resources in Japan, if these resources are going to be used 
extensively worldwide, Japan must see to it that the use of 
recycled resources will not depend on raw materials, and a 
recycling system to be constructed must reflect this 
requirement. Since the model shown in Fig. 1 is conceptual, in 
order to construct an effective system which is achievable, it 
will be necessary to make a detailed study of recovery and 
recycling routes as well as of cost.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Tokyo Electric Power is aggressively pursuing R&amp;D of new 
energy. Especially promising in this respect is a fuel cell, for 
which expectations run high when it is implemented as a power 
generation system closely linked to sites where demands 
originate. At present, the company is conducting basic research 
in the fused carbonate and solid electrolyte fuel cell types, 
while, at the same time, engaging itself in the validation test 
of the Itsui 11 MW plant using a large capacity installation for 
regional supply as well as development of element technology 
involving a phosphate fuel battery. With respect to 
small-capacity equipment, in order to gain knowledge concerning 
development of a large-capacity equipment, the company is 
continuing a validation test aimed at grasping the practical 
capabilities of plants developed by manufacturers. 
  Following report 2 which appeared in the previous issue, 
this 
paper will deal with the 200kW fuel battery installed at 
Shibaura 4-chome District Thermal Supply Center (Shibaura FHC) 
focusing on operational condition and performance verifications 
based on long-term operations. 
<H5>  2. Summary of Plant </H5>
  The fuel battery installed within the Shibaura DHC is a 
pre-PC-25 battery (the initial lot (53 machines produced) of 
PC-25 currently being shipped by IFC, an American firm) 
designated as PCX, a package-type water-cooling 
atmospheric-pressure battery with rated output, 210 V; and 
output voltage, 210V, 3&phgr;, 50H. It is possible to obtain heat 
of approximately 210 Mcal/H when hot water with temperatures in 
the range 70-80&deg;C constitutes rated capacity. 
  This PCX was installed Kandenko Co. main office building's 
underground floor in March 1988; after its indoor operations had 
been verified, it was moved to Shibaura DHC First Plant in May 
1990. The Shibaura DHC is designated as the [19.6ha] district by 
Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and its first plant with its all 
electric heat supply facility with a receiving capacity of 
1,500kW, installed in the underground floor of Shibaura Square 
Building, consists of a high-efficiency heat pump and a 
large-scale heat storage tank. Almost all electric output of PCX 
is consumed as DHC's electric power; moreover, since nearly all 
exhaust heat can be supplied to heat a storage tank, we are 
verifying not only reliability and durability of the plant but 
also conducting a verification test aimed at gaining some idea 
of the facility's performance as a cogeneration system.

  Table 1 shows the plant's operating performance. The 
cumulative generating time set to operating hours of the Kanko 
Denko Head Office Building as of now, 31 January 1993, is in 
excess of 17,000 hours. Although the main unit of the battery 
had been exchanged twice, as a plant, these hours represent the 
longest operating time in the world. Moreover, immediately after 
the facility had been moved to the Shibaura DHC, the world 
record of 3,246 hours were set. Judging from the operating 
conditions of PCX thus far observed, first of all, at Kandenko 
Main Office Building, because of the plant's adjustment tests 
and the initial problems associated with PCX, it was necessary 
to halt the operations frequently, which contributed to lowering 
of time availability factor. After it had been moved to Shibaura 
DHC, however, we enjoyed relatively stabilized operations, 
raising the time availability factor to 71.1&percnt;. However, 
because 
of a drop in voltage, it became necessary to limit output. For 
this reason, the usage ratio based on calendar day was low. 
After the old battery was replaced by a new one, because of the 
adjustment tests which made it necessary to stop operations, and 
combined with invertor problems, the availability factor is 
somewhat low; however, an average operating load of 137.6kW 
represents a considerable improvement.

  Table 2 shows PCX thermal supply performance of PCX at 
Shibaura DHC. During the period since August 1989, when 
operations began, until December 1992, a total of 1,183 Gcal of 
heat was supplied to the DHC thermal storage tank. This 
constituted 3.9&percnt; of the total heat output at DHC during 
this 
period. Especially with respect to the hot water supply, by 
supplying 50&percnt; of the fuel battery's exhaust heat, PCX was 
able 
to meet 69.2&percnt; of DHC's energy needs. It also is 
contributing to 
the production of hot water to some degree. As for cold water, 
although an adsorption type refrigerator was installed 
experimentally, with the temperature of hot water at 75&deg;C, 
enabling PCX to use its heat, COP remained low at 0.3&deg;C even 
when it was at its highest; consequently we were not able to use 
it in actual operations. A daily average of the amount of hot 
water supplied was 1,366Mcal. This represents 26.6&percnt; of 
planned 
heat output of 5,135Mcal at the rated operation time 
(214kcal/H). Although this figure is somewhat lower than the 
calendar day usage ratio of 32&percnt;, we were able to use 
85.2&percnt; of 
heat generated by the PCX plant at DHC. 
<H5>  4. Battery Main Unit </H5>
  In June 1991, because of a drop in battery voltage, the main 
unit of the original PCX battery became incapacitated when its 
cumulative power generating time reached 10,250 hours. It was 
then replaced by a reserve battery, PCX No.1 equipment 
(validation test completed at the company's New Tokyo Thermal 
Power Station) which already had put in 5,000 hours. Like the 
original battery, under the similar circumstances, this one also 
stopped working in May 1992, when a cumulative total of 
operation hours reached 9,723. It became evident from this that 
the durability of PCS battery's main unit, namely, its effective 
life, is approximately 10,000 hours. However, since reformer and 
other equipment still are functioning well, we had decided to 
replace only the battery's main unit and to continue our test 
until 1996. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-48A>             Fig. 1. Properties of Battery I-V </FIG>




  We assembled Toshiba 200kW battery's main unit (prototype 
No. 
1), which has the same specifications as ONSI Company product 
PC-25, a modified version of PCX, into the PCX plant. In August 
1992, jointly with Toshiba, we began testing its effective life 
value. With respect to the PC-25, based on its experience with 
the original PCX battery, the company improved part of the 
material and changed battery's current density from 
300mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  to 235mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; . In addition to 
the change made in its form and setting of piping, modifications 
in control systems and cooling conditions through raising of 
rated voltage became necessary. In replacing the PCX battery 
with the PC-25, we studied the extent to which these can be 
matched. 
  The properties of Toshiba 200kW battery's initial I-V are 
shown in Fig. 1. In comparison with the PCX battery, the battery 
voltage, including the part in which battery's current density 
is decreased, has been raised substantially. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-48B>             Fig. 2. Energy Balance at 200kW </FIG>




  Fig. 2 shows the energy balance (obtained when accumulated 
hours reached 2,500) of the plant equipped with the new 200kW 
battery. Power generating efficiency is as high as 36.6&percnt;. 
When 
this figure is compared with the 30.2&percnt; efficiency of the 
PCX 
battery (the value obtained when accumulated operating hours 
reached 5,600 as had been reported previously), it became clear 
that the increase in battery voltage has resulted in the 
substantial increase in efficiency. However, gain in 
power-generation efficiency was counterbalanced by a decrease in 
exhaust heat recovery efficiency. As a result, we obtained an 
overall efficiency of 79&percnt;, approximately the same as that 
of 
the PCX battery. 
  Fig. 3 traces changes which occurred in battery voltage as 
of 
February 1993 during the course of power generation for over 
2,000 hours. The test data covers the use of the plant for only 
a short period of time, and in comparison with that of the PCX 
battery, a drop in voltage of the new battery is small, and 
effects of start-stop are not clearly shown. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-49A>             Fig. 3. Shift in Battery Voltage Through Time (Equivalent </FIG>




  With the exception of the test period devoted to data 
collection, thus far, because of the invertor problems, the 
plant operating load was restricted, not exceeding 150kW. 
<H5>  5. Long-Term Usage Conditions of Reactor </H5>
  In order to improve the reliability of the fuel battery, 
important problems which must be dealt with, in addition to that 
of the battery's main unit, have to do with achieving longer 
effective life of a reformer and other chemical reactor 
catalysts. Since the beginning of operations, we hardly have had 
any problem with the reformer and low-temperature fuel 
processing units (desulfurizer and CO transformer) of this PCX, 
still going strong after over 17,000 hours of continuous 
operations. These will serve as a valuable validation data. 
  With this test research, in order to validate plant's 
performance, including twice-a-year load tests, we conducted 
from time to time the analysis of gas constituents found at the 
outlets of the reformer, CO transformer, battery anode and 
cathode. Fig. 4 shows relationships between the conversion rate 
of the reformer's methane [= (CO+CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; ) / 
(CO+CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; +CH&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; )], thus far obtained from 
analytical results, and reforming pipe temperature. Also shown 
in Fig. 4 is the city gas flow rate. During this period, because 
of the problems involving PCX battery's main unit and a change 
made in the temperature setting of the reforming pipe, 
output-reforming temperature relationships are found to vary. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-50A>             Fig. 4. Reforming Pipe Temperature and Methane Conversion </FIG>




  When we examine the same output (city gas flow rate) shown 
in this figure, we can see that the methane conversion rate 
increases as the reforming temperature climbs. The dotted lines 
of the graph represent the conversion rate of methane reforming 
reactions in a chemical equilibrium state when the difference 
between the reforming pipe temperature and internal reaction 
temperature is hypothetically set at 50&deg;C under the same 
reaction condition (1 atm. S/C=3.5). When a load is low, we can 
see that the tendency is to approach fairly close to equilibrium 
state. 
  Moreover, as flow rate increases, a methane conversion rate 
tends to go down; for this reason, it appears that the setting 
of reforming pipe temperature is raised so that the conversion 
rate can be maintained at a certain level. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-51A>             Fig. 5. Change in Performance of Reformer and CO </FIG>




  Fig. 5 below shows changes occurring in methane and CO 
transformer's conversion rates through time. The methane 
conversion rate is designed to compensate temperature so that, 
as shown in Fig. 4, the CPX's original reforming pipe 
temperature can be set up (for output). As you will see from the 
graph that under 100kW output hardly any changes occur in 
methane conversion rate since the beginning of the operations. 
Recently, however, output is exceeding 150kW, causing 
substantial reduction in the methane conversion rate. At 
present, even if the methane conversion rate should become 
lower, since the hydrogen usage ratio of the battery's main unit 
is not increasing out of proportion, we do not have any process 
problems. It will be necessary, however, to monitor the 
situation in the future. 
  Effects of the CO conversion rate [=Co&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  / 
(CO+CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; )] on the flow rate and temperature, on the 
other hand, are relatively small. Consequently, the plant is 
able to maintain good operating conditions since the beginning, 
to date, showing hardly any performance degradation. With 
respect to the desulfurizer, moreover, since sulfur content of 
the city gas is low, about 5 ppm (odorant), it is not possible 
to obtain data containing dusulfurization ratio. However, for 
the present, we see no strong indication of toxic effects 
involving the reformer. In the future, as long as power 
generation goes smoothly, we intend to continue with the 
validation of the durability of these reaction catalysts. 
<H5>  6. Plant Reliability </H5>
  Since this PCX plant is a testing machine, we had had many 
problems in the beginning. After it was moved to Shibaura DHC, 
however, with the exception of gradual degradation of the 
battery's main unit itself, we were able to enjoy relatively 
stable operations. However, at present, it has yet to reach the 
level of practicality required of a commercial machine. 
  The number of troubles which occurred in the course of CPX 
operations are categorized and summarized in Table 3. From July 
1991 to June/July 1992, a cut-off period at Shibaura DHC, the 
replacement of the old battery with the new and an overall 
maintenance of the facility were carried out. Because of the 
operating experience and the state of PCX No. 1, the maintenance 
work, including a preventive measure, carried out for 1992 
consisted of the following: replacing a water condenser and a 
cooling water circulation pump reserve; changing an 
air-flow-control valve and the type of non-stoppage electric 
source unit; use of domestic electric parts products; and a 
complete exchange of cooling water piping packing.

  An overall picture shown in Table 3 indicates that 
instrumentation failure, steam water leaks, and problems 
associated with electric parts occur frequently. Moreover, 
degradation of the PCX battery's main unit and corrosion of the 
heat exchanger, considered typical phosphate fuel battery 
problems, also have occurred. When viewed in terms of the period 
involved, because of the effects of the enforced measure, the 
number of failures per 1,000 hours gradually has been 
decreasing, especially a clear trend for improvement, insofar as 
the same types of troubles are concerned, is emerging. However, 
because of the long-term operations, new troubles also are being 
generated. Our plan is to examine causes of these troubles and 
implement a measure for improvement so that the same problems 
will not occur in the next generation of the equipment 
developed. After August 1992, as facility maintenance began to 
take effect, water leaks and rudimentary electrical problems 
began to decrease. However, the fact that the plant controller's 
PI/O base broke down twice indicates the need for improvement in 
instrumentation and control systems. 
  As a problem involving unmanned equipment occurring since 
August 1992, we must mention a failure of the invertor which hit 
us immediately after the old battery was replaced by the new. 
Because a fuse was cut and a transistor sustained a damage, it 
became necessary to shut down the plant. The same thing happened 
again when the invertor pole was replaced. Since we experienced 
hardly any problems when operating with the 150kW battery, we 
came to the conclusion that this might have been caused by 
assembling the main battery unit with high voltage into the 
invertor without providing any design margin. By making various 
measurements around the invertor, we were able to identify 
electric parts which possibly could be exceeding utilization 
requirements. In February 1993, the invertor's condenser, fuse, 
and other electric parts were replaced, and their installation 
verified the stable operations of the PCX plant at the rated 
output. 
<H5>  7. Future Test Schedule </H5>
  Our plans are to undergo pre-utilization inspection 
necessitated by the change made in the battery, subsequent to 
which, to continue the verification of durability of the new 
fuel battery and of effective catalytic life of the reformer and 
mono-oxidation transformer until 1996. At the same time, we plan 
to examine an actual operating setup by carrying out operations 
and by simplifying maintenance. In addition, our plans include 
introduction of the Tomitsu Energy Park's 50kW battery and three 
other small equipment, and we hope to fully utilize our 
experience gained through the operation of the PCX plant in 
developing these battery equipment.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Concerning the problem of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; , several studies on 
the feasibility of the direct removal of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from 
fossil fuel power plants have appeared&lt;sup&gt; 1)&lt;/sup&gt; . As a 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  removal technology, one which comes to our mind 
involves techniques of low-temperature processing, absorption, 
adsorption, and membrane separation. In this report, we deal 
with a system designed to absorb and remove CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  by 
using a combination of hollow fiber membrane and liquid 
absorbent and to recycle the liquid absorbent through the use of 
the conventional heat dissipation type recycling method. This 
method has found its application in the fields of study of 
medicine, artificial lungs&lt;sup&gt; 2)&lt;/sup&gt; , and the closed system 
of the universe&lt;sup&gt; 3),4)&lt;/sup&gt; , as well as in the basic 
research of the various types of gases&lt;inf&gt; 5),8)&lt;/inf&gt; . 
Recently, its application has been extended to the field of 
research aimed at removing CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; &lt;sup&gt; 9-13)&lt;/sup&gt; . In 
our previous report, we covered the analysis of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
mechanisms, selection of liquid absorbent, the evaluation of 
various types of membranes by absorption tests using hydrophobic 
porous membrane materials, and a test combined with a recycling 
part designed to verify the possibility of developing this 
method into a system. Also reported was the result of basic test 
we conducted using the direct current small module, constituting 
a film module used in the actual equipment--namely, the 
high-efficiency removal of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  and reduction in 
absorption component size. In this report, we will deal with 
results of the evaluation test aimed at improved performance and 
durability of the membrane, which plays a central role in this 
method and of feasibility study when this method was applied to 
the actual machine. 
<H5>  2. Experiment </H5>
  In our previous report, we pointed out that the porous 
material's mass transfer coefficient is approximately 10 times 
larger than that of the composite membrane, and, therefore, the 
porous membranes are more suited to our 
system&lt;sup&gt; 12,13)&lt;/sup&gt; . In this report, we examined the 
optimization of the porous membrane and its durability. 
Moreover, in order to provide a clear picture of the 
characteristics of the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system, we conducted 
an experiment on CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -N&lt;inf&gt; a&lt;/inf&gt; OH system. 
<H5>  2.1. Experimental Equipment </H5>
  We used the nine types of porous membranes shown in Table 1 
as specimen membranes. They consist of Membrane No.1 
polypropylene(PP) and Nos. 2-5, polyethylene (PE), used as 
specimen mainly in the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; NaOH system experiment; 
Nos. 6-8 membranes polytetrafuloroethylene (PTFE); and No.9 
membrane, a surface-reformed PE membrane produced by applying 
the coating of fluorine group monomers, mainly used as a 
specimen for CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system. For a specimen gas, 
assuming the use of coal firing, we used a cylinder gas 
(consisting of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; =15&percnt;, O&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; =5&percnt;, and 
N=80&percnt;) saturated with moisture. Temperatures used in 
experiments were 50&deg;C for membrane durability test and 
25&deg;C for the optimization test of porous material membranes, 
because of the availability of abundant material property data 
when we wish to make comparison with the previous report or to 
conduct analysis. Moreover, for this experiment, we used the 
equipment shown in the previous report&lt;sup&gt; 11-13)&lt;/sup&gt; , 
together with its method of testing and measurement.

<H5>    2.2 Results and Considerations </H5>
  (1) Optimization of Porous Membrane 
  The main factors related to transfer properties of the 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NEA system requiring our consideration are 
membrane thickness &dgr;, hole ratio &egr;, and hollow fiber 
diameter d&lt;inf&gt; i&lt;/inf&gt; . Of these, since d&lt;inf&gt; i&lt;/inf&gt;  is 
determined principally from the standpoint of resistance to 
liquid flow and increase in temperature by reaction heat, and 
separated from the transfer characteristics, this paper will 
deal with only the effects of &dgr; and &egr;. 
  1) Membrane Thickness &dgr; 
  The resistance of porous gas membrane is given in the 
following equation: 
  (1) R&lt;inf&gt; M&lt;/inf&gt; =(k&lt;inf&gt; M&lt;/inf&gt;  x 
d&lt;inf&gt; 0&lt;/inf&gt; /d&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; &lt;sup&gt; -1&lt;/sup&gt; 
  The material transfer coefficient of the gas membrane, 
K&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  is written as follows: 
  (2) k&lt;inf&gt; M&lt;/inf&gt; =D&lt;inf&gt; G&lt;/inf&gt;  x &egr;/(&dgr; x &khgr;) 
  We conclude from equations (1) and (2) that the smaller the 
&dgr;, the smaller the R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  will become,. However, if 
this is to be evaluated by the experiment, it is necessary to 
have a membrane with a constant &egr; and a variable &dgr;. It 
will 
be extremely difficult to obtain such a membrane; moreover, what 
actually matters is the ratio of R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  to the entire 
resistance R&lt;inf&gt; &tgr;&lt;/inf&gt;  shown in the following equation: 
  (3) R&lt;inf&gt; T&lt;/inf&gt; =(K&lt;inf&gt; exp&lt;/inf&gt;  x H)&lt;sup&gt; -1&lt;/sup&gt; 
  Consequently, we computed R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt; /R&lt;inf&gt; &tgr;&lt;/inf&gt;  of 
highly porous membranes Nos. 6-9 in order to obtain their 
relationship with &dgr;. Moreover, in Equation (3), 
K&lt;inf&gt; exp&lt;/inf&gt;  is an experimental value of an overall material 
transfer coefficient K of the inside diameter, and H denotes a 
henry constant of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system. Using the 
following equation&lt;sup&gt; 14)&lt;/sup&gt; , we used the compensated 
H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O's henry constant H&lt;inf&gt; w&lt;/inf&gt; : 
  (4) 
log(C&lt;inf&gt; A&lt;/inf&gt; /C&lt;inf&gt; AW&lt;/inf&gt; =0.3C&lt;inf&gt; B&lt;/inf&gt; (1+xC&lt;inf&gt; B&lt;/inf&gt; 
  In this equation, for &kgr; we used value 0.95 contained in 
the 
reference source&lt;sup&gt; 14)&lt;/sup&gt; , and for bending ratio x in Eq. 
(2), also using the reference source&lt;sup&gt; 15)&lt;/sup&gt; , we assigned 
3.0 to bending ratio x in Eq. (2). 
  Results of computations are shown in Table 2. R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt; 
of the membrane No. 8, characterized by a large :gd (350&mgr;m) 
and small &egr;, is 96.6s/m, while R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  of the membrane 
No. 9, characterized by small &dgr;, viz., 120&mgr;m, and large 
&egr;, 
viz., 0.8, is 18.4s/m. The former is approximately 5 times the 
latter. However, the ratio of R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt;  to the total amount 
of resistance ([R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt; /Rt]x100) in the case of membrane 
No. 8 is 4.896&percnt;. In the cases of membranes Nos. 6, 7, and 
9 
(&dgr;=120-122&mgr;m), ranging from approximately 1.7 to 
3.4&percnt; t 
also is fairly small. In other words, with the 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system, membrane resistance R&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt; 
for the most part can be disregarded. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-54A>             Table 2. Membrane Resistance (Computed Values) </FIG>




  2) Hole Ratio &egr; 
  In our previous report&lt;sup&gt; 12)&lt;/sup&gt; , in order to study the 
relationship between K and &egr;, we used 9 types of PE membranes 
in the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system and reported on its result. However, 
in the case of PE membranes, because of moisture produced in the 
membranes by MEA, we no longer were certain whether we still had 
the specimen membrane on which accurate evaluation could be 
based. In order to resolve this problem, we reviewed the 
experiment using highly hydrophobic PTFE membranes (Nos.6-8) and 
a reformed-surface membrane (No.9). Moreover, using the 
membranes (Nos.2-5,8) with a wide variety of &egr;, we 
experimented with the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NaOH system, a system of 
reaction absorption which is similar to the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA 
system but on which moisture has little effect. This was 
intended to provide supplementary data in resolving the problem 
created by the characteristics of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system. 
Fig. 1 shows the relationship between K and &egr;. 
  With the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NaOH (1 mol/l) system, 
data on the relationship between K and &egr; are relatively well 
defined, as the larger the &egr;, the larger K will become. With 
the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA(5mol/l) system, on the other 
hand, few data are available to elucidate relationship between K 
and &egr;; consequently somewhat less well defined in comparison 
with those in CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NaOH system. However, its tendency 
for the most part is similar to that of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -NaOh 
system, another reaction absorbing system, in that the larger 
&egr; is, the larger K will become. With the 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O system, on the other hand, the 
situation is completely different. K exhibits no relationship to 
&egr;, and is related only to R&lt;inf&gt; eL&lt;/inf&gt;  (currently obtaining 
detailed data). It appears that this largely is due to the 
thickness of the liquid boundary membranes of both 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O system (physical absorption) and 
the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system (reaction absorption). We hope to 
present reason for this in detail at the next opportunity.

  2) Comprehensive Material Transfer Coefficient and Liquid 
Flow Condition 
  In connection with the relationship between 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system's comprehensive material transfer 
coefficient K and liquid flow conditions, we conducted several 
experiments using PP and PE membranes. Because of the effects of 
moisture produced by MEA on the membranes, we have not been able 
to identify a clear tendency. In the experiment presented in 
this paper, we used the PTFE membrane (No.8), in which any 
effect of moisture can be disregarded, to examine relationship 
between K and R&lt;inf&gt; eL&lt;/inf&gt; . As indicated by the test result 
shown in Fig. 2, K is only slightly proportionate to 
R&lt;inf&gt; eL&lt;/inf&gt; &lt;sup&gt; 0.07&lt;/sup&gt; , showing almost minimal effects 
of Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; . As reference, we showed in Fig. 2 
data&lt;sup&gt; 3)&lt;/sup&gt;  generated when 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O system was used. In this case, K 
is proportionate to Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; &lt;sup&gt; 0.33&lt;/sup&gt; , exhibiting 
definite effects created by Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; . The reason why the 
dependence of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 's K on Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt;  differs 
between CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system and 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  system may be stated as follows: 
since the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system absorbs reactions, its 
liquid boundary membrane is thin and therefore it is difficult 
for ReL to impact it, whereas the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
system is a physical absorption system, its liquid absorption 
membrane is thick and therefore it can be easily impacted by 
Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; . 
  (3) Durability of Membrane 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-55C>             Fig. 3. Properties of Comprehensive Material Transfer </FIG>




  Fig. 3 shows changes K had undergone during many hours of 
experimentation in which No. 3 membrane (material: PE) and No. 8 
membrane (material: PETE) were used under the following 
conditions: temperature T=50&deg;C and MEA concentration 
C&lt;inf&gt; B&lt;/inf&gt; =5 mol/l. Although No.3 membrane's K 
falls rapidly with passing of time t, with No.8 (PETE), hardly 
any change was noted in K for a long period of time, viz., 
t=approximately 6000 hours. In Fig. 4, angle of contact cos 
&thgr; 
by Kaelble, et al.&lt;sup&gt; 16)&lt;/sup&gt;  and a surface tension &dgr; are 
plotted. MEA(50&deg;C)'s &dgr; is 0.059N/m (a value actually 
measured), and the PEFE's angle of contact cosign at this value 
is cos&thgr;=-0.2 and the PE membrane is cos&thgr;=0.1. 
Consequently, 
PEFE membrane has a large negative value. That is why moisture 
does not affect PEFE membrane.

<H5>    3. Feasibility Study </H5>
  An example of a feasibility study of a CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
removal system using a membrane method is described below: 
<H5>  3.1. Summary of Study </H5>
  (1) A 1000MW system designed to remove 50&percnt; of 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from coal fire boiler's exhaust gas is being 
examined. The conditions are shown in Table 3. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-56B>             Table 3. Conditions of Feasibility Study </FIG>





    (2) Relationship between a CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recovery rate and 
a membrane area will be examined below. 
  The diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 5. This system 
is 
based on a chemical absorption method using a hollow fiber 
membrane in the part which absorbs CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; . In an 
absorption fluid recycling part, a heat radiation-type recycling 
tower, the kind used in the conventional chemical absorption 
method, is being used. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-56C>             Fig. 5. CO </FIG>





<H5>    3.2 Results of Study </H5>
  (1) The result of the study when a CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recovery 
rate was set at 50&percnt; is shown in Table 4. In this system, 
the 
absorption part was established on the assumption that a gas 
flue would be expanded somewhat. Moreover, a draft loss on the 
gas side of the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  absorption part was 
approximately 100mmH&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O. When the expansion of the 
duct work is taken into consideration, a loss probably will be 
in the range of 1/3-1/5 of that produced by the conventional 
chemical absorption method. 
  Moreover, since absorption fluid will free-fall on the basis 
of the membrane's inner static differential, a pressure loss on 
the absorption side of the membrane part is approximately 
0.6kg/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; .

  (2) Hollow Yarn Membrane's Permeable Quantity N is expressed 
as follows: 
  (5) N = K x A x &dgr; P l&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; 
  Here, &dgr;Pl&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  is a CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  log 
mean partial pressure through a membrane and expressed in the 
following equation: 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-57A>             EQUATION </FIG>

&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Consequently, when we increase the amount of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
recovery, namely, permeation volume N, Pg&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  falls 
causing a decrease in &dgr;Pl&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; ., the 
required membrane area A expands substantially as shown in Fig. 
6 (not reproduced). 
  Moreover, In this study, since MEA and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
[produce equimolecular reactions], we set a MEA/CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
molecular ratio as a constant. 
<H5>  3.3. Considerations </H5>
  The conventional methods of filling columns and wetted wall 
columns require a well-designed installation space and duct 
placement because the absorption part becomes a column type. 
With our method, however, it is possible to install the 
absorption part by somewhat expanding a horizontal gas duct. 
  Moreover, since our method is expected to reduce a loss in 
gas-side draft from one-third to one-fifth of the draft loss 
produced by the filling column and wetted wall methods, with the 
power of the exhaust gas fan, it can be controlled at around 
2000-5000kWh/h. Moreover, as considered in the previous section, 
with an increase of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  recovery ratio, a membrane 
area will increase at a rapid rate. Consequently, a scale of 
equipment, also, will be enlarged. For instance, if we are to 
take a viewpoint that an amount of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emitted from 
a certain power plant a year is to be reduced, rather than 
aiming for high recovery ratio using one boiler, as shown in 
Fig. 7, we can consider a method of using two boilers with 
low-recovery rate. Consequently, in selecting CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
recovery ratio, it will be essential that we consider and 
examine fully the amount by which CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions can 
be reduced in addition to the method of plant operations and 
economic factors.

<H5>    4. Conclusion </H5>
  Concerning the removal of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from thermal power 
plant's exhaust gases through the method of gas absorption using 
hollow fiber membranes, we had conducted a series of experiments 
and a feasibility study and were able to obtain the following 
results: 
  (1) With the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system, the smaller the 
value of a membrane thickness &dgr; is, the larger the 
comprehensive material transfer coefficient K will become; still 
its effect is quite small, no more than 5&percnt;. To the liquid 
Reynolds number Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;/inf&gt; , K is proportionate to 
Re&lt;inf&gt; L&lt;sup&gt; 0.07&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/inf&gt;  and its effect is very slight. The 
hole 
ratio &egr;, however, greatly affects K, as the larger the value 
of &egr;. the larger K will become. 
  (2) With the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system, although wetness of 
the membrane caused by MEA greatly reduces its durability, if a 
hydrophobic material (for instance PTFE) is used, we can 
eliminate this problem. This fact was verified by the continuous 
processing test lasting for approximately 6000 hours. 
  (3) It was verified that, in order to enlarge and stabilize 
the porous membrne's K when the CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -MEA system is 
involved, we must use highly hydrophobic membrane materials so 
that &egr; can be enlarged as much as possible. 
  (4) We applied this method to a system designed to separate 
and recover 50&percnt; of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  from gas emissions from a 
1000MW coal fire boiler and compared its results with those 
produced by the conventional chemical absorption method. We 
found that with the new method we were able to reduce exhaust 
gas fan power to around 5000kWh/h. 
  We wish to thank membrane makers and their associates who 
provided us with specimen membranes and valuable information 
concerning those membranes and membranes in general. We also are 
greatly indebted to those at university research laboratories

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] This year, Four Japanese companies have marketed a 
high frequency HEMT (high electron mobility transistor) having a 
low noise factor (NF) of 0.45dB. Of the four companies, Toshiba 
has produced a lower-cost resin sealed version. The HEMT is used 
in the front end of tuners in broadcasting and communications 
satellite tuners. A lower noise factor means that the diameter 
of parabolic antennas can be reduced. 
  Broadcasting satellite tuners receive microwaves (selected 
stations) in the 12GHz band, amplify the signal, and convert it 
to intermediate frequencies (IF) of about 1GHz. The HEMT is 
often used in the high-speed amplifiers in the front end of 
broadcasting satellite tuners. This transistor must not only 
operate at high frequency (12GHz), but must also have a low 
noise factor. The noise factor is expressed as a quotient of the 
signal-to-noise ratio of the input signal and the 
signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal. The lower the noise 
factor is, the higher the output signal-to-noise ratio will be. 
Therefore, demodulation can be performed even with small 
diameter parabolic antennas. 
  Fujitsu, NEC, Toshiba, and Sharp are the four companies 
which 
have begun shipping samples of the HEMT, which has a noise 
factor of 0.45dB in the 12GHz band (this is the standard value 
at 25&deg;C). (See Table 1) Of these companies, Toshiba has 
developed a low cost resin-sealed version. Toshiba also claims: 
``When reflow soldering is performed, there is less conductivity 
between pins than in the ceramic sealed type.'' When the noise 
factor is reduced to 0.45dB or lower, antenna diameter can be 
decreased to 30-40cm. With a noise factor of 0.6dB, antenna 
diameter exceeds 40cm. 
<H5>  InGaAs Used Most Frequently in Electron Transit Layer </H5>
  The reason that the noise factor is lower in HEMT 
transistors 
is because both the electron mobility and electron density are 
high. The noise factor is inversely proportional to the electron 
mobility and electron density, and directly proportional to the 
gate length. Impurities such as silicon are not added to 
generate electrons in the electron transit layer (composed of 
GaAs) in HEMT transistors. There is a separate electron supply 
layer (AlGaAs, etc.) which supplies the electrons. Since there 
are almost no impurities to disturb the mobility of electrons in 
the electron transit layer, electron mobility is high even for 
high electron densities. To increase the electron density in the 
electron transit layer, Fujitsu developed a product with an 
InGaP electron supply layer.

  NOTE: The Toshiba package is resin; all others are ceramic. 
Except for NEC, all companies use GaAs for the substrate and 
InGaAs in the electron transit layer. For the electron supply 
layer, Fujitsu uses InGaP, and Toshiba and Sharp use AlGaAs. NEC 
has not announced the material used. In addition to these 
manufacturers, the following companies have also announced 
low-noise, high-frequency transistors such as the HEMT: 
Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co. (NF reference is 0.5dB at 
12GHz), Oki Electric Industrial Co. (0.55dB), Mitsubishi 
Electric (0.55dB), Hitachi Ltd. (0.6dB), and Sony (0.7dB). Rolm 
began marketing a product with 0.7dB noise factor, but this 
product has been discontinued. Sanyo Electric is developing a 
high-frequency transistor called TMT (two-mode channel FET), 
which has a noise factor of 1.6dB (25&deg;C, 60GHz). Samples of 
this product will begin shipment in 1994, but no product will be 
for the 12GHz band.

  [Text] Fujitsu has adopted a multichip module CPU in its 
K-6900 office computers which appeared on the market in October, 
1993. Units can be upgraded by replacing the former type CPU 
with the new modular CPU. Compared to the conventional mounting 
method in which package-sealed LSI chips are lined up on a 
printed circuit board, instruction execution is four times 
faster, and only 1/5 of the former mounting space is required. 
  The new multichip module consists of six CMOS LSI chips--a 
processor, 32k byte data cache, 32k byte instruction cache, and 
memories (3 chips) to store processor microcodes. The source 
voltage for each chip is +3.3V. A design rule of 0.5&mgr;m has 
been used for all chips. 
  The processor consists of a CISC section (which does not 
contain microcodes) and a RISC section. Each section will handle 
32-bit and 64 bit architecture. The CISC and RISC sections have 
register files in common. The CISC section is directly 
interchangeable with the already existing K series. The 
instruction set of the RISC section is unique. A super scalar 
design has been adopted, and three instructions can be executed 
at the same time. 
  Instructions are executed at 30MHz. When using the 
conventional mounting method in which package-sealed LSI chips 
are lined up on a printed circuit board, instructions are 
executed at about 15MHz. At this time, the critical path of the 
processor limits the instruction execution speed of the 
multichip module. However, it is estimated that the module will 
be capable of 60MHz operation in the future. 
<H5>  Flip Chip Mounting Technology Adopted </H5>
  The module is 44.6 x 67.4mm in size. This is reportedly 1/5 
the size of the conventional printed circuit board mounted 
version. 
  AIN is used as the modules substrate material. Wiring layers 
formed of Cu thin film, and insulating layers formed of 
polyimide create a 5-layered construction, and the LSI chip 
(bare chip) is connected using the flip chip design. Cu wiring 
is 12&mgr;m thick, and spaced at a pitch of about 30&mgr;m. 
  The number of flip-chip connections is 5000-6000 for the 
entire module. Most of these--about 3000--are for the CMOS 
processor chip. Connection spacing (pitch) is an extremely 
narrow 0.21mm, and a solder-to-solder connection is used. The 
size of solder bumps formed on the LSI chip is about 100&mgr;m. 
The electrodes on the substrate side are first gold plated and 
then covered with solder. After the module has passed testing, 
the gap between chip and substrate is filled with resin by 
[potting]. 
  Power consumption by the entire module is 18W. The module 
has 
a heat sink, and sufficient heat dissipation is achieved by 
forced air cooling (at the rate of about 1 meter wind per 
second). This design allows the heat to leave the LSI chip 
through the solder connection and AIN substrate, toward the heat 
sink. For this reason, many solder connections also serve as 
heat dissipation paths.

  [Text]Oki Electric Co., Ltd. has developed the ``OP32/50N'' 
RISC chip for embedded applications such as in high performance 
page printers and facsimile machines. The design of the new chip 
is based on the PA-RISC architecture of Hewlett Packard Co. The 
new chip operates at 33MHz, and provides performance of 39MIPS. 
A DRAM controller and DMA controller are integrated into the 
chip, and an internal cache memory is provided for permanent 
storage of data and instructions. 
  Oki Electric has developed the OP32/50N RISC chip for 
embedded control applications such as page printers, facsimile 
machines, and portable type information devices. The design of 
the new chip conforms to Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC architecture, 
meeting the specifications for level 0, which does not include a 
memory management function. The OP32 series might also be used 
in ASIC microcomputers to incorporate customer-requested 
functions, and as the CPU core of ASSP (application specific 
standard product) chips. When this is done, Oki Electric claims 
that it will become possible to modify instruction sets 
according to user requests. 
  The OP32/50N integrates a DRAM controller which can manage 
four memory banks, and a 4-channel DMA controller. The CPU core 
provides 8K byte and 4K byte cache memories for instructions and 
data, respectively. 
  The address and data busses within the CPU core are both 32 
bits wide. The maximum address space which can be accessed is 4G 
(2&lt;sup&gt; 32&lt;/sup&gt; ) bytes. This is divided into 4M 
(2&lt;sup&gt; 22&lt;/sup&gt; ) byte banks for management. 
<H5>  Instructions Permanently Resident in Cache </H5>
  The new chip provides the capability of storing data and 
instructions permanently in cache memory. This is called the 
``cache freeze'' function, and is used to store instructions 
having particularly stringent processing time restrictions, and 
for data which is frequently accessed. 
  The areas which can be used for permanent storage are set in 
2K byte units for the instruction cache, and in 1K byte units 
for the data cache. The cache freeze function is activated by 
software after the desired data or instructions are read once 
using an input/output command. 
<H5>  39 MIPS Operation Achieved at 33MHz </H5>
  The OP32/50N executes 39M instructions per second (based on 
VAX-11/780) while operating at 33MHz. Source power is +5V and 
power consumption is 3W. The chip is sealed in a 208 pin PGA 
package, and is scheduled to be shipped in the spring of 1994. 
  In 1995, Oki plans to commercialize the OP32/60C CPU core 
and 
the OP32/60N microcontroller, which will operate at 40MHz on a 
source voltage of +3.3V. These products will use 0.5&mgr;m CMOS 
technology.

  [Text] Line delay can be estimated taking into account the 
effects of input waveform degradation and load capacitance of 
the gate output. NEC will begin to take orders in December of 
1993 for the 0.5&mgr;m cell-based LSI ``CB-C 8 Series'', which 
provides users with this type of design environment for the 
first time. The chip was developed in conjunction with Synopsys 
Inc., a major U.S. manufacturer of logic synthesis tools, and 
adopts a delay model that calculates the effects of input 
waveform degradation and other effects using a table format. In 
this manner, line delay can be calculated in a short time within 
an accuracy of 10&percnt; relative to the SPICE simulation 
method. The 
delay test method can be used not only to evaluate timing, but 
also to confirm that delay time meets requirements for logic 
synthesis. Test results can be incorporated during logic 
synthesis. 
  NEC will begin taking order in December of 1993 for the 
0.5&mgr;m cell-based LSI ``CB-C8 Series.'' this chip provides the 
user for the first time with a method that calculates line delay 
taking into account the effects in input waveform degradation 
and output load capacitance for the design of cell-based LSIs. 
The NEC-designed delay model (which includes line equivalency 
circuits and approximation methods for signal waveforms) can be 
used for verification of timing and also for calculation of 
delay time used for reference during logic synthesis. (See Table 
1.) 
<H5>  Delay Model Determines Success in 0.5&mgr;m Products </H5>
  LSI manufacturing companies (such as NEC, Matsushita 
Electronic Industrial Co., etc.) agree that the success of the 
0.5&mgr;m generation cell-based LSI relies upon the ``line delay 
model.'' Even in the 0.8&mgr;m generation, when designing LSIs 
having a high operating frequency, ``one-chip system versions 
could not be achieved due to the absence of a delay model'' 
(Casio Computer Co.). However, according to Fujitsu, the cost 
involved in rebuilding the design environment was the underlying 
problem. In the 0.5&mgr;m generation, high frequency applications 
such as in image processing are on the rise, and NEC reports 
that ``this problem can no longer be ignored.'' 
  Matsushita Electric and Toshiba, which have preceded NEC in 
commercializing 0.5&mgr;m cell-based LSIs, have not released this 
type of delay model to customers. Matsuthita Electric recently 
reported that although input waveform cannot currently be taking 
into consideration, a second-generation model that includes the 
effects of the input waveform will be announced in 1994. Toshiba 
is also reportedly prepared to release such a model. 
<H5>  Calculation of Delay for Input Waveforms </H5>
  The parameters emphasized by NEC in the determination of 
line 
delay are the degradation of input waveform and gate output load 
capacitance. The test model and CAD methods were developed 
together with Synopsys Inc. 
  To calculate delay attributed to input waveform and output 
load capacitance, the delay times written in a table format are 
referenced. The SPICE simulation is a method which is generally 
used to accurately calculate line delay arising from the input 
waveform. However, the verification time needed for lines in 
LSIs which have several hundred thousand gates, becomes 
extraordinary. NEC's delay evaluation method which uses a table 
format, greatly reduces the verification time required, and also 
provides accuracy within 10&percnt; error of the SPICE 
simulation. 
  The new evaluation method can be used not only for timing 
verification, but also for predicting line delay for logic 
synthesis. Delay time calculations can be done while performing 
logic synthesis in order to meet the timing and other conditions 
established by the design engineer. In the past, it was 
difficult to add revisions to incorporate the results of timing 
verification, because the delay model used for timing 
verification was not the same as the model used for logic 
synthesis. 
  Establishment of the design environment for 0.5&mgr;m 
generation cell-based LSIs has made it possible to use high 
performance CPU cores. In the CB-C8 series, the CPU cores which 
can be used include the ``V30 MX'' 16-bit processor, the low 
power-consumption type RISC processor ``V810'', and the 
MIPS-related ``Vr series'' RISC processors. There are also 
peripheral function blocks, including a RAM bus interface which 
transfer 500M bytes of data per second. The chips will 
reportedly be profitable in the market for high-end workstations. 
  Chip samples will be produced at the Sagamihara plant, and 
mass production will take place at NEC Yamaguchi. Once the 
0.5&mgr;m technology gains a foothold in the market, plans call 
for mass production at NEC Kyushu and NEC Hiroshima, which are 
currently producing the CB-C7.

  [Text] NEC has demonstrated that a natural oxide layer 
containing suboxide in which silicon has not completely 
oxidized, is the cause of increased resistance of 0.25&mgr;m 
contact holes. Although the effects of natural oxide film on 
contact resistance have been known in the past, this is the 
first time the effect has been confirmed in an actual prototype 
device. To clarify this effect, the composition at the bottom of 
the contact hole was analyzed and its correlation to contact 
resistance was examined. From the results obtained, it is 
possible to divide newly adapted cleansing processes into those 
which are necessary and those which are not necessary. For 
example, the 
H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; SO&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; -H&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; O&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
process which eliminated carbon, is judged to be an unnecessary 
process. 
  Controlling the resistance of contact holes has been a major 
problem in the development of the 256M DRAM. This opinion is 
being shared by an increasing number of process engineers who 
are developing advanced DRAM products. Contact resistance 
increases in proportion to the amount of size reduction 
achieved, and some type of countermeasure is required at the 
0.25&mgr;m level. In fact, NEC announced at the 1993 IEEE 
International Solid State Circuits Conference held in February, 
that when conventional cleansing processes were used on a 256M 
prototype chip, contact resistance exceeded 1k ohms, the upper 
design limit. By using numerous cleansing processes such as 
chemical dry etching, which is known to be effective in the 
treatment of contact holes, resistance was eventually controlled. 
  However, it is essential to reduce the number of cleansing 
processes for mass production. Consequently, it became necessary 
to clarify the cause of the rise in contact resistance in order 
to eliminate unnecessary cleansing processes. 
<H3>  Suboxide Natural Oxide Film Causes Increased Contact 
Resistance </H3>
  NEC's ULSI Device Development Laboratory made a series of 
contact-related presentations at the 1993 International 
Conference on Solid-State Devices and Materials in August, at 
the 54th Conference of the Applied Physics Association in 
September, and at the ECS 184th Meeting in October. (For 
example, refer to Nakamori, et. al., Lecture No. 29a-ZE-3, 54th 
Conference of Applied Physics Association, September, 1993). In 
Summary, it was clarified that (1) the cause of the increase in 
contact resistance is natural oxide film, and (2) the natural 
oxide film contains a large amount of suboxide. 
  With regard to (1), this became evident from the correlation 
between contact hole bottom composition and contact resistance 
when measured using the increased temperature elimination method 
for samples which had been dry etched and those which had not. 
When chemical dry etching was performed using plasma, resistance 
dropped about one half. 
  With regard to (2), contact holes were formed over the 
entire 
surface of the substrate, and the same treatment was performed; 
the bonding status of the natural oxide film was analyzed by XPS 
upon completion of each process. Immediately after contact holes 
are formed, silicon bonds with oxygen and fluorine. 2+ and 3+ of 
the XPS signal, which corresponds to the suboxide, only appears 
when chemical dry etching is not performed. 4+, which 
corresponds to complete SiO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; , remained regardless of 
the dry etching treatment; however, at the end of the increased 
temperature elimination method, it remained only when chemical 
dry etching was not performed. From these results, it can be 
seen that the cause of increased contact resistance is natural 
oxide film which contains suboxide. 
<H5>  Chemical Dry Etching Breaks Si-Si Bonds </H5>
  NEC considers the following type of mechanisms to be 
responsible for the effectiveness of chemical dry etching on 
natural oxide films which contain suboxide. 
  (1) Etching contact holes creates a ``damage layer'' on the 
substrate sublayer. 
  (2) The O&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  plasma treatment, which eliminates 
contamination after contact holes have been formed, creates an 
oxide film on the contact surface, and suboxide forms on the 
damage layer below the oxide film. 
  (3) Oxide film on the surface is eliminated by subsequent 
cleansing processes. However, the suboxide layer containing 
insufficient oxygen has Si-Si bonds; the Si-Si bonds come to the 
surface and cannot be removed by conventional cleansing 
processes. As a result, a natural oxide film remains below the 
Si-Si bonds. 
  (4) Chemical dry etching can break the Si-Si bonds. 
  (5) Natural oxide film is removed by subsequent cleansing 
processes. 
  Other causes for increased contact resistance include the 
effects of carbon contamination, as indicated by Fujitsu and 
Toshiba. However, NEC regards the effects of carbon to be 
minimal. This is because analysis has shown that the amount of 
carbon which remains at the bottom of the contact hole is 
5&percnt; or 
less, which is small compared to the 30&percnt; of oxygen. From 
the 
results described above, the following conclusions can be drawn 
with regard to cleansing processes: 
  (a) a process which breaks the Si-Si bonds, such as chemical 
dry etching, is required, 
  (b) a process to remove oxide film again after Si-Si bonds 
have been broken is required, and 
  (c) sulfate processing to eliminate carbon is not necessary.

  [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Co., Ltd., has 
developed a transistor which operates at the fastest speed 
achieved to date. it is an HBT (heterojunction bipolar 
transistor) which stacks different types of compound 
semiconductor crystals. The production process can be improved 
by using indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) thin-film crystal 
which is suitable for highly mobile electrons. In this way, an 
operational frequency of 176 gigahertz, a new world record, has 
been achieved. High-speed operation of 100 GHz or more is 
achieved even at low operational current of 1 milliampere or 
less. The subminiaturization of devices clears the way for 
integrating the HBT. Efforts will continue to pursue even higher 
speeds to prepare devices for use in optical communications 
having a transmission capability of 40 gigabits per second, 
which is the latest research objective. 
  Until now, the world's fastest transistor achieved to date 
was an HBT developed by NTT which operated at 171 GHz and which 
used gallium arsenide (GaAs) crystal. Since using GaAs has 
approached the limitation with regard to higher operational 
frequency, NTT used InGaAs to break its own world record. 
  It has been known that InGaAs is well suited with regard to 
high electron mobility, device miniaturization and lower 
operating current. However, until now there has been little 
know-how pertaining to process technologies. Therefore, a 
transistor which takes full advantage of the characteristics of 
this material has not been achieve,d and the quality of the 
material has been compromised. 
  By modifying the etching process during formation of the 
device, NTT was able to achieve a transistor with three strong 
points--high speed, low power consumption, and subminiature 
device size. Not only is it the world's fastest operating 
transistor, but achieving an operating frequency of 100 GHz on 
one milliampere or less of current is also a first. More 
specifically, at one milliampere of current, an operational 
frequency of about 130 GHz is possible. 
  NTT plans to achieve an optical communications network which 
can transfer 10 gigibits of information per second, and various 
laboratories are involved in developing devices and exchange 
equipment technology which allows transfer of 40 gigabits per 
second. 
  The new achievement greatly promotes the practical use of 
the 
HBT in future optical communications systems. Applications of 
the HBT are also likely to increase when it is incorporated into 
integrated circuits.

  [Text] The generational change is accelerating for 
application specific ICs (ASICs). 0.5&mgr;m subminiature 
processing technologies used in the production of 16Mbit DRAMs 
are beginning to be seriously applied in the production of the 
ASIC, and the delay between use of technology for advanced 
memories and application to the ASIC is becoming shorter. On the 
other hand, companies are wrapping up development of 1&mgr;m 
processes; and in contrast to the DRAM, which is shifting to a 
generational co-existence market structure, significant changes 
are being incorporated into the ASIC based on customer demand. 
<H5>  Lower Power Consumption, Higher Speed </H5>
  In the past, LSI technology has driven the development of 
the 
DRAM in the Japanese semiconductor industry--two to three years 
after DRAM mass production has started using the most advanced 
ultrafine fabrication technology, the same generation technology 
has been applied to production of the ASIC. 
  However, production of the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC is already about 
to 
begin, even though production of the 16M DRAM started during 
1992-93. 
  Fujitsu, which began production of the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC 
without 
delay, is expanding production lines at its Aizu Wakamatsu 
factory. Toshiba has also begun expansion at its Iwate facility 
and is preparing a trial production line in the United States. 
NEC recently announced that it will produce a 0.5&mgr;m 
cell-based 
IC in Yamaguchi, following on the heels of the gate array 
produced in 1992. 
  In contrast to the DRAM market, which has experienced a 
slow-forming market, NEC reported that ``demand will grow 
relatively quickly'' for the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC, in conjunction with 
demand for low power consumption and fast operating speed in 
portable type equipment. Toshiba reports that the momentum will 
make 0.5&mgr;m products the mainstay in terms of quality, by 
1995. 
  At first, in order to comply with requirements for personal 
computer and multimedia applications chiefly in the United 
States and create a market for the 0.5&mgr;m ASIC, it was 
necessary to upgrade the level of system technologies. This was 
because if the level of integration was raised using ultrafine 
fabrication technologies, it would take more effort than even 
before to design one product, and from the user's viewpoint 
design improvement was reaching its upper limit. 
<H5>  New Development on 1&mgr;m Products Being Wrapped Up </H5>
  Therefore, companies involved in device production are 
quickly abandoning the design of older generation products in 
order to focus engineering efforts. In particular, NEC and 
Fujitsu have discontinued taking new orders for products using 
1&mgr;m and older technologies. Toshiba is also devoting 
night-and-day efforts toward the development of submicron 
products. 
  Of course, as always, the production of 2&mgr;m devices will 
continue as before. however, if the engineering shift and demand 
structure match, it appears that the production scale of ASICs 
using 1&mgr;m and older technology will shrink faster than that 
of 
the 1M, which used 1&mgr;m technology and experienced strong 
demand.

  [Text] Mitsui Toatsu Chemical Co., Ltd. has developed a new 
type of semiconductor package using metal/polyimide/copper 
plating, entering the market with a product called the MQP 
(metal quad package). Its structure consists of bonding a double 
layer FPC (flexible printed circuit board) to a copper board 
which has good heat dissipation characteristics without using 
glue. The leads are formed by etching copper foil. A prototype 
has been developed in the form of an LCC (leadless chip carrier) 
with leads bending inward, to eliminate concern over mounting on 
printed circuit boards. Printek, an associated printed wiring 
board manufacturing company headquartered in Atsugi, Kanagawa, 
has set up trial production of 20,000-30,000 pieces per month, 
and has begun to ship samples. Since internal wiring can be 
easily performed, applications are also expected to be found in 
MCM (multichip module) applications. Beginning in FY94, 
production could shift upward to 200,000 or more pieces per 
month. 
  The prototype package is 10mm square, and the width of 
conductive leads which have been copper-plate etched, is 
75&mgr;m. 
Spacing between leads is 100&mgr;m. Although the [acta] lead 
pitch 
is 0.2mm, Mitsui Toatsu plans to reduce this to 50/50&mgr;m, 
0.1mm 
pitch in the future, which will be optimum for mounting ASICs 
(application specific ICs). ASICs and CPUs require packages 
having high pin counts, and the amount of power consumed is 
large, so dissipating the heat generated by the chip has been a 
problem. Until now, there has been no low-cost, highly 
functional package material available. 
  The MQP developed by Mitsui Toatsu uses a design in which an 
adhesive polyimide layer is situated between copper foil and 
copper plate; the leads are identical to TAB (tape automated 
bonding), and copper foil is etched. it can be shaped like an 
LCC in which the chip is bent, so ordinary mounting processes 
can be used. The package can even accommodate 2-3W high power 
chips. 
  Like the FPC, internal wiring can be performed, and multiple 
layers (up to four) can be achieved. For these reasons, the 
package is also expected to find a large future market for MCM 
applications. 
  At present Mitsui Toatsu has set up experimental facilities 
at an associated company called Printek, and is producing 
20,000-30,000 pieces per month. Samples are already being 
shipped. At the mass production stage, there is likely to be a 
significant reduction in cost compared to the ceramic-type LCC, 
and the company would like to begin commercial production as 
early as FY94, at 200,000-300,000 pieces per month.

  [Text]Hitachi Ltd. has developed the industry's first 
next-generation ultrathin standard DRAM modules for 64-bit 
busses. Although DRAM modules for 32-bit busses are currently on 
the market, the new modules can be easily used with 64-bit 
busses, and are ultrathin at 3.8mm. Two types of modules have 
been developed with different capacities--one is an 8-kilobyte 
product and the other is a 32-kilobyte product. Samples are 
scheduled to begin shipping in December, 1993. The samples are 
priced at &yen;60,000 and &yen;345,000 respectively. Mass 
production will start in January, 1994, at 1000 units per month 
(for both types combined), and will be increased to 5,000 units 
per month in June later in the year. 
  The modules developed by Hitachi can be used with both 
32-bit 
and 64-bit busses, which provides greater ease of use. The model 
substrate is mounted on a printed wire board (1.27mm thick) 
which has low thermal expansion. Nine DRAMs sealed in TSOP 
ultrathin packages can be mounted on each side of the board. 
  The 8-megabyte product can accommodate 4M DRAMs, and the 
32-megabyte product can accommodate 16M DRAMs. 
  In the past, DRAM modules contained chips sealed in SOJ 
packages. However, in the new module, TSOP packages are used to 
achieve an ultrathin dimension of 4.0mm thick. 
  There are 168 power source pins in the new module. This is 
five times greater than in former modules made by Hitachi. 
Depending on the version use, read time is 60, 70, or 80 
nanoseconds. The module is 133.35mm long, and 25.4mm wide. 
  Hitachi is currently commercializing 32-pin and 72-pin DRAM 
modules. Compared to the 72-pin module, the new module has one 
third the volume, and is 60&percnt; thinner. The new modules are 
expected to be widely used in work stations, where fast 
operation and large capacity is required.

  [Text] Hitachi Central Manufacturing Laboratories has 
developed four product types of the ``H8/3877'', which is in the 
8-bit, single chip microcomputer ``H8/300L Series'', and which 
has such peripheral functions as a 26 column LCD display 
controller/driver and a multi-tone generator built in. Shipping 
of each kind of sample will begin in succession from May. In 
particular, it will be marketed for wireless devices, 
multi-function cordless phones and portable audio. 
  The new products will be based on the low voltage, low power 
consumption characteristics of the H8/300L Series. They will be 
the largest 8-bit microcomputers in the industry that have a 
built in LCD controller/driver for a 26 column display, and it 
will be the first time in the industry that a multi-tone 
generator, which conventionally is external, is built into one 
chip. By doing this, it becomes possible to have a maximum 208 
segment display in 52 segments by four common. Furthermore, by 
adding an independent DTMF oscillator, a multi-tone generator 
circuit that can form optional wave form patterns in optional 
frequencies between 40 Hz-4 kHz is built in, and all of the 
kinds of tone generation functions which are used in wireless 
devices and phones can be easily configured. Also, the ROM 
capacity built in is 60 KB with the ZTAT board, or 60 KB, 48 KB, 
or 40 KB with the mask ROM boards. They are offering a large RAM 
capacity of 2 KB. 
  In addition, the processing speed can also be finely program 
controlled by providing a high speed active mode at a minimum 
command execution time of 0.4 microseconds when operating at 10 
MHz, a middle speed mode (1 MHz) as a low power consumption 
active mode, and sub-active mode, sub-sleep mode, and standby 
mode which rely on an independent sub-clock (32 kHz). 
  The power source voltage is 2.7 to 5.5 V. The package is a 
100 pin QFP (pin pitch 0.5mm). The price of samples of the ZTAT 
board will be &yen;2,900. The prices for the mask ROM boards 
will be from &yen;970 to &yen;1,120 (when purchasing 50,000 
units). Hitachi plans to have a monthly production of 10,000 
units in April 1994, and a monthly production of 100,000 units 
in October.

  [Text] NEC has developed technology to form the minute 
capacitors needed in 1 Gbit DRAM's, the temporary read/write 
memory required for memory storage operations, using a strontium 
titanate thin film which is a material with a high dielectric 
constant. NEC has succeeded in leading the world in the 
formation of a practical dielectric film with an average 
thickness of 50 nm by a proprietary CVD method that concentrates 
on a technique to supply the raw material gases. In order to 
realize a 1 Gbit DRAM, it is indispensable to break through the 
barriers using new technologies that differ from the 
conventional in every manufacturing process. NEC's new 
technology is recognized to be one of these. 
  Ordinary memory cells are configured by one transistor and 
one capacitor. The current technological development involves a 
technology that forms a dielectric film on an electrode that is 
a capacitor and accumulates electric charge. The charge 
accumulates on the surface of the electrode and the dielectric 
film, and a signal is stored in memory. It is difficult to 
maintain the volume of capacitor accumulation charges while 
improving the degree of DRAM integration and promoting the 
miniaturization of processes, and this has become a big problem. 
For this reason, in order to realize 1 Gbit DRAM's it is 
indispensable to replace conventionally used silicon oxide and 
nitride films and tantalum oxide films, and to establish a thin 
film formation technology for substances with a higher 
conductivity. 
  NEC's use of strontium titanate to form a thin film is a 
electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) and metal oxide CVD method. 
Gasified strontium, titanium and oxygen are transported via 
separate piping, and are mixed directly before blowing them on a 
substrate maintained at 600&deg; C. An ECR plasma of oxygen is 
generated during the formation of the film, and this promotes 
the decomposition of the raw material gases and the supply of 
oxygen necessary in the film. Thin films can be formed that have 
an even chemical composition by incorporating propriety 
techniques into the equipment such as supplying the three kinds 
of gases in a stabilized condition in separate piping, and 
introducing technology that controls the pressure of the 
titanium group gases. The characteristics of the film made by 
this technology have achieved practical levels for the light 
refractive index, for the dielectric constant and for current 
leaks. This shows the uniform quality of the materials. 
  NEC already developed a thin film formation technology for 
strontium titanate using the physical vapor deposition method 
called sputtering, but it was difficult to form a film of a 
fixed thickness on electrodes that have a three dimensional 
structure. This problem can be solved by thin film formation 
technology using the proprietary CVD method. NEC will announce 
the results of its research at the American Materials Society 
that will convene in San Francisco. Making X-ray exposure 
practical is also indispensable to realizing DRAM's.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric completed a synchrotron 
radiation (SR) device which is being considered for use in 
future generation semiconductor etching. The device was 
completed in its Central Research Institute in Itami City. This 
type of device is being put into use only by a limited number of 
corporations, such as IBM in America and NTT. Currently, the 
major domestic semiconductor manufacturers are using other 
equipment at the national research institutes. It appears that 
the use of this facility will greatly accelerate Mitsubishi 
Electric's development of future generation semiconductors. 
  By using electromagnets, the SR device deflects the orbit of 
high energy electrons accelerated nearly up to the speed of 
light and produces highly intense linear SR in a direction 
tangential to the orbit. The equipment consists of a LINAC 
[linear accelerator] device to produce electrons; a synchrotron 
to accelerate the electrons; and a superconducting SR ring which 
produces radiation. 
  The SR facility developed and brought into use by Mitsubishi 
Electric is a device that has the distinguishing features of 
being compact and low cost for industrial use. In particular, 
Mitsubishi succeeded in reducing the circumference of the 
electron beam orbit in the recently completed superconducting SR 
ring from more than 10 meters in conventional types to 9.2 
meters, making it the smallest compact model in the world. The 
amount of liquid helium consumption has been reduced to 3 liters 
per hour which is a fraction of the quantity used in 
conventional facilities. 
  It is estimated the entire cost of the synchrotron facility 
is several billions of yen. Mitsubishi Electric's person in 
charge of semiconductor development sees the possibility of the 
economic feasibility of using the SR facility in real 
semiconductor plants (because SR from a single SR unit can be 
simultaneously supplied to a maximum number of 20 processing 
units.) 
  It is expected that the SR will be used for DRAM (Dynamic 
Random Access Memory) chips in the 256 megabit--1 gigabit range. 
Hitachi Ltd. and other big semiconductor makers, using the 
equipment at the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics, 
Ministry of Education, are advancing in research and 
development. Mitsubishi Electric is using the SR from the 
completed SR facility to begin the development of semiconductors 
within the company and is planning to promote the marketing of 
the SR equipment.

  [Text] The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute [JAERI] 
together with the National Space Development Agency [NASDA] shed 
light on the phenomenon that is the main cause for major 
breakdowns in semiconductors used in space in a strong radiation 
environment--the ``single event effect.'' This elucidation is 
based on recent results obtained at the ion radiation research 
facility built by JAERI at its Takasaki laboratory in 1991. The 
joint research confirmed the onset of the single event effect 
when heavy ions with a LET [linear energy transfer] punch power 
of 2.8 were shot into the core of integrated circuit memory 
chips to be used on the space station. According to the 
Department of Material Development, Takasaki Radiation Chemistry 
Department, JAERI, it ``would like to have these results 
reflected in countermeasures for electronic equipment aboard 
artificial satellites and such.'' As for the long term plan, the 
goal is the development of a cubic crystalline silicon carbide 
(3C-SiC) semiconductor--a new material that can resist radiation 
in order to deal with the increased necessity to use 
semiconductor elements in a radiation environment such as that 
of cosmic space and nuclear power facilities. 
  Moreover, in the space radiation environment, cosmic rays 
contain heavy ions with very high energy--especially cosmic rays 
coming from the Milky Way Galaxy. Here, when merely one heavy 
ion penetrates a semiconductor element, the large electric 
charge produced along the trajectory causes a malfunction. This 
phenomenon is called the single event effect and it is a large 
cause of the breakdown of artificial satellites and such. 
  In an irradiation experiment conducted on an integrated 
circuit memory chip (256 kilobit SRAM) in the core of the 
Japanese experimental module for the space station whose 
development is being jointly promoted by the United States, 
Japan, and Europe, it was found that a sudden increase in the 
frequency of breakdowns (memory reversal error) occurred when 
the heavy ion penetration exceeded LET 2.8. Moreover, the 
incorporation of these results into the space radiation 
environment module made it possible to predict directly the 
occurrence of the breakdowns. 
  In addition, JAERI succeeded in directly measuring the speed 
of the single event phenomenon--a feat, which, until then, had 
been considered to be impossible. JAERI was able to do this by 
using a device that can compress a heavy ion microbeam to a 
width of one micron. JAERI determined that the speed was in 
hundreds of picoseconds, which is an ultra-high speed transition 
current.

  [Text] The Science and Technology Agency (STA) has firmed 
up its approach for building the legal policies to allow the 
large scale light emission facility ``SPring-8'' to function as 
a facility open to outside organizations. Spring-8 is being 
built by the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI, 
Akikazu SHIMAMURA, director) and the Institute of Physical and 
Chemical Research (RIKEN, Minoru ODA, director) at the Harima 
Science Park City in Hyogo Prefecture. The STA has clarified the 
system for the maintenance, management and use of SPring-8, and 
the goal is to make a world class nuclear research facility that 
is a Center of Excellence which will provide the light emissions 
necessary for basic research in broad range of science and 
technology fields such as materials science and life science. 
The budget related to this proposal will be presented at the 
next normal meeting of the Diet for the following fiscal year. 
  SPring-8 is a facility in which electrons accelerated up to 
eight billion electron-volts are continually circulated in an 
accumulation ring with a circumference of 1,436 meters. 
Researchers fervently hope that light be will shed on the 
1/100,000,000 cm world by using the emitted light that is 
generated whenever the orbit of the electrons is bent. The beam 
lines which will put out the emitted light will be made widely 
available not only to Japanese industrial, academic and 
governmental institutions, but also to research organizations 
abroad. 
  Currently, the group responsible for construction is the 
Joint Team for the Planning and Promotion of the Large Scale 
Light Emission Facility, which is jointly composed by JAERI and 
RIKEN. &yen;38.5 billion in business expenses has been invested 
up to the current fiscal year, and budgets will be appropriated 
successively every year up to the actual joint opening in FY 
1998. Because ``it appears that construction is making smooth 
progress,'' (Yoshishige ARATA, Director of the Bureau For the 
Promotion of Science and Technology), the current action is to 
set the pace for the fulfillment of the utilization system based 
on legislative policy. In the current Research Exchange 
Promotion Law, there seems to be difficulties with fully opening 
SPring-8 to extramural organizations.

<H3>  The SPring-8 Large Scale Light Emission Facility Will Be 
Open To Foreign and Domestic Researchers, and Specialists Will 
Be Trained </H3>
  The Science and Technology Agency (STA) has consolidated the 
basic concepts for the management of the Japan Synchrotron 
Radiation Research Institute (JASRI, Osamu UNO, director) which 
is responsible for the management and operation of the large 
scale light emission facility ``SPring-8'' which is under 
construction at the Harima Science Park City in Hyogo 
Prefecture. Specialists in emitted light facilities, who are few 
in number worldwide, will be trained, and new ways of utilizing 
emitted light will be developed by focussing on a flexible 
research system in which the facility will be opened to 
researchers both from Japan and abroad. 
  JASRI was established in 1990 in order to unify the 
management of Spring-8; the beginning of operations is scheduled 
for 1997 when a part of the equipment will go on line. 
  The basic kinds of research will include: 1) development of 
new fields for the utilization of emitted light; 2) research to 
advance the equipment; and 3) support for the experiments of 
extramural researchers who will use the facility. 
  In order to heighten the efficiency of research, research 
themes are being studied by a committee that includes extramural 
specialists. The fluidity of researchers will be increased by 
setting time limits for research themes. A utilization system is 
being prepared which will be truly open to extramural 
researchers. 
  The STA has taken a course of creating legislation in order 
to smoothly promote the management and operation of this 
facility. 
  Spring-8 is a circular accelerator with a circumference of 
approximately 1.4 kilometers, and it can heighten the energy up 
to 8 giga-electron volts. By bending this electron beam with 
magnets SPring-8 can generate light emissions that are about 
1,000 times brighter than that of conventional equipment. 
  It is expected that, in addition to basic research in 
physics, the facility will play a role in a wide variety of 
research fields such as the diagnosis of blood vessels in the 
heart, and the analysis of semiconductor materials on the atomic 
level. Test operations will begin from 1997. The facility will 
be of a larger scale and will have a higher performance than 
similar equipment that is being built in Europe and the United 
States.

  [Text] The research group of Assistant Professor Takayoshi 
KOBAYASHI of the Physics Department at Tokyo University has 
developed spectral technology which has the world's highest 
temporal analytic capacity at the femtosecond level (a 
femtosecond is one one trillionth of a second), and they have 
succeeded in observing for the first time the process of the 
structural relaxation of polydiacetalene (PDA). The spectral 
technology developed is a ``resonance Raman gain spectrometer'', 
and it is a high performance spectrometer that can grasp the 
chemical changes of polymers as they change on the ultra short 
time base of femtoseconds. The structural relaxation based on 
the photo-excitation of PDA was anticipated by other methods, 
but this is the first time that the structural changes have been 
substantiated experimentally. PDA is a low level semiconductor 
material, and it is expected that PDA will have applications in 
non-linear optical materials. It is thought that in the future 
this new spectrometer will be very powerful in the analysis of 
the functions and structures of non-linear optical materials. 
  Up to this point, this type resonance Raman gain spectrum 
and 
temporal analysis type device had been a very difficult and 
awkward detection method, and the research group of Assistant 
Professor Kobayashi was the first to develop it as a means for 
observing the changes of molecular combinations of polymers that 
change instantly on the level of several hundred femtoseconds. 
The device has an actual temporal analysis capacity to measure 
the spectrum in several hundred femtoseconds. 
  It is expected that the electron spectrum data relating to 
the principle chain structure relaxation of PDA will greatly 
expand the electron spectrum data gathered so far involving 
changes in polymers. However, it cannot be said that the 
electron spectrum directly reflects the structure of atoms and 
molecules, and it has been necessary to specify the structure by 
observing atoms and molecules using an oscillation spectrum 
based on their internal oscillations. 
  As a temporal analysis oscillation spectral measurement 
methods, up to this point there have been: temporal analysis 
infrared absorption; resonance natural emission Raman 
dispersion; and the resonance coherent anti-Stokes Raman 
dispersion method or the so-called CARS method. However, in 
these methods of oscillation spectral observation, there are the 
problems of an insufficient temporal resolution and of a great 
amount of noise because the structural relaxation of polymer 
excitons occurs instantaneously on the femtosecond base. 
Therefore, these methods are lacking a decisive feature. 
  With the new technology, there is very little background 
signal noise, and it has ultra high resolution on the level of 
several hundred femtoseconds. In the observations of PDA this 
time, as expected, signals were observed indicating that the 
structure of the free exciton changed by photo-excitation in 
less than 200 femtoseconds from the acetylene type to the 
butatriene type. The mechanism by which non-linear optical 
materials bring about these changes instantly will be clarified 
by the equipment developed, and conversely, the equipment will 
spur on the development of future functional optical materials 
by playing a role in the development of new non-linear optical 
materials.

<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  Backed by technological innovation that continues to evolve 
rapidly, the society and economy of Japan are starting to 
undergo major developments in urbanization, 
informationalization, globalization, and the advance into a more 
aged society as the 21st century nears. To maintain housing and 
social capital in such a setting, the government must cope with 
the changes in social trends, the needs and perceptions of the 
citizens, as well as the changes surrounding construction 
affairs. 
  Given such a situation, on 13 May 1992 the Minister for 
Construction submitted to the Construction Technology 
Development Council a report entitled "The Vision of 
Construction Technology Development with Prospects for the 21st 
Century." That report clarified the future directions of 
construction technology development and listed priority research 
topics, promotion policies, and the roles of industry, 
government, and universities. 
<H5>  1. Basic Policies on Construction Technology R&amp;D </H5>
  As indicated in the Basic Public Investment Plan, the years 
remaining in this century are an important time for forming good 
social capital and stock. In the maintenance of housing and 
social capital from now on, we must tackle improvements in 
productivity and operational safety, and, with consideration 
always given to future increases in the costs of maintaining and 
renovating buildings, the maintenance of housing and social 
capital must be harmonious with the environment, including the 
global environment. 
  As the directions in which to proceed with the maintenance 
of 
housing and social capital, it is important 1) that the 
facilities are easy-to-use, beautiful, and strong, 2) that 
consideration is given to the environment, and 3) and that 
construction is carried out efficiently and safely. 
  The report sets forth the following as the concrete R&amp;D 
objectives and the priority R&amp;D themes to correspond with 
those 
directions in the maintenance of housing and social capital. 1) 
Automated and man-power-saving technology at construction sites 
to cope with a smaller labor force; 2) Maintenance-free 
technology to cope with the inevitable increases in the costs of 
maintaining and renovating facilities; 3) Energy-conservation 
technology for coping with global environmental problems. 
  The following shows the concrete development goals for those 
themes. 
  (1) Automation and Man-Power-Saving Technology 
  The goal is to develop technology that will achieve an 
overall two-thirds saving in manpower by automation and 
conservation of manpower in all aspects of construction. 
  (2) Maintenance-Free Technology 
  The goals are to make new and renovated facilities 
maintenance-free and to develop technology that will keep 
maintenance and management costs at their current levels. By 
extending the number of years that new and renovated facilities 
will last, the aim is to develop technology for reducing by 
two-thirds the renovation investments needed with the current 
number of years that facilities can be used. 
  (3) Energy-Saving Technology 
  The goal is to develop technology for reducing by up to 
two-thirds the overall energy consumption per unit production in 
order to keep the amount of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions at their 
current level, as based on the October 1990 Cabinet decision. 
<H5>  2. R&amp;D Promotion Measures </H5>
  The MOC will set up project teams consisting of people from 
the ministry, regional construction groups, laboratories, etc.; 
clearly set forth the development objectives; and effectivate 
prioritized R&amp;D. Then, to develop and distribute the 
technology, 
the MOC will use a system of general technology development 
projects, joint research involving the government and the 
private sector, a construction technology evaluation system, and 
technology inspection and demonstration for construction 
technology developed by the private sector. 
  The following diagram illustrates the process, from 
implementing the technology development to the application and

  The following gives a brief overview of the MOC's technology 
development efforts, centering on general technology development 
projects, that correspond to the housing and social capital 
maintenance direction discussed above. 
<H3>  1. Development of Technology for the Maintenance of 
Easy-To-Use, Beautiful, Durable, and Easy-To-Maintain Housing 
and Social Capital </H3>
  (1) Development of Technology for Functional Improvements in 
Maintenance and Renovation of Housing and Social Capital 
(general technology development project, FY91-95) 
  Important issues from now on are appropriately maintaining, 
managing, and preserving the functions of the housing and social 
capital that has been developed thus far, and making 
improvements by modifying those functions that are not in tune 
with the times. 
  This effort involves 1) developing ways to use infrared 
beams, ultrasound waves, etc., to quickly and non-destructively 
survey and diagnose public works structures; 2) developing 
machinery that works underwater for surveying and repairing 
underwater structures; 3) technology for strengthening and 
improving the durability of concrete floor plates for elevated 
roadways, etc.; and 4) developing a housing and social capital 
management system that uses computers to diagnose and evaluate 
deterioration. 
  (2) Development of Technology for Creating Beautiful Scenery 
(New) (general technology development project, FY93-97) 
  The maintenance of high-quality housing and social capital 
that is in harmony with the environment and beautiful scenery 
that brings out the most of a region's uniqueness are desired. 
That entails the needs to develop technology for maintaining 
scenic areas in which public works structures and buildings 
become one with the surrounding environment, and to form 
attractive public spaces. 
  This effort involves the design, construction, and 
development of high-quality materials for improving scenery, 
with awareness of that which mars the scenery. Furthermore, this 
effort will involve R&amp;D and the establishment of methods with 
respect to planning, design, and construction for creating 
scenic areas with consideration given to ecosystems. And, in 
order to more accurately and easily assess various designs, the 
MOC will develop a support system that uses computer graphics. 
<H3>  2. Developing Technology for Environmentally Harmonious 
Housing and Social Capital Maintenance </H3>
  (1) Development of Resource-, Energy-Conserving Construction 
Technology (general technology development project, FY91-FY95) 
Tackling global environmental problems has also become an 
important issue in the field of construction. In that, 
construction technology development is important in finding 
solutions to the problems of excess energy consumption and 
CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions due to the use of fossil fuels, which 
lead to global warming. 
  In this effort the MOC will try to determine the amounts of 
energy consumption and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions in the field of 
construction, and study the choices of construction methods that 
will contribute toward reducing energy consumption and the load 
on the environment. In addition, the MOC will develop methods to 
determine for individual land-use districts the amounts of 
energy consumed and the amount of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emitted as a 
result of social and economic activities, and will use that as 
data for future land-use decisions. 
  (2) Development of Technology for Re-Using and Suppressing 
the Generation of Construction Byproducts (general technology 
development project, FY92-FY96) 
  Considering the scarcity of final disposal sites, developing 
technology for re-using and suppressing the generation of 
construction byproducts (leftover soil, construction waste 
materials) is an urgent issue. This effort involves the 
development of new technology for on-site re-use of construction 
wastes, and technology for processing and recycling sidewalk 
blocks and other such wastes into construction materials. 
Furthermore, the MOC will develop efficient processing machinery 
for recycling concrete aggregate from waste concrete, and 
technology for recycling the powders generated as by-products of 
that processing. 
  In addition, in joint government-private research, the MOC 
will carry out the development of basic technology for creating 
green spaces, and will evaluate the following two themes: the 
development of efficient direct cleaning systems in rivers and 
other such public waterways, and the development of 
high-noise-reduction soundproofing. 
<H3>  3. Development of Technology for Maintaining Housing and 
Social Capital Efficiently and Safely </H3>
  (1) Development of New Construction Technology (general 
technology development project, FY90-FY94) 
  Continually dealing with the problems of more older 
construction workers and a shortage of skilled laborers, 
construction businesses must findways to promote more 
efficiency, raise the level of quality and safety, and improve 
the work environment. This effort involves the development of 
automated construction technology for mechanizing jobs in 
dangerous environments to eliminate the need for humans to do 
that work. The MOC will also develop pre-fab technology based on 
the factory production of reinforced concrete structures, and 
will maintain standards compatible with new technologies for 
automating and rationalizing construction work so that the new 
technologies quickly become more widespread. 
  In addition, the MOC will engage in the following technology 
development for the purposes of more safety in construction 
work, and to prevent large objects from crashing down on workers 
and workers from coming in contact with construction machinery, 
which cause more than half of all accidents: 1) temporary 
scaffolding in units so that assembly and disassembly high above 
the ground are not necessary; 2) various kinds of sensors and 
control technology for preventing workers from coming in contact 
with construction machinery; 3) database construction based on 
the gathering and analysis of data on accident causes and 
countermeasures. 
  Furthermore, in joint research with the private sector, the 
MOC will be involved in the following four themes: 


    -  the development of an automatic map-information 
recognition system, 
  -  the development of new ground probing 
technology, 
  -  the development of a construction information 
system based on IC cards, and 
  -  the development of 
high-performance, functional concrete (new). 

    The MOC will also evaluate the development of construction 
methods for rationalizing the construction of pillars and beams 
in reinforced concrete structures. 
<H5>  4. Technology Development Involving Basic Topics </H5>
  The MOC's technology development efforts involving disaster 
prevention, new materials, and other themes outside of the 
priority R&amp;D topics are: 


    -  the development of technology for preventing 
earthquake disasters in large cities (general technology 
development project, FY92-FY96), 
  -  the development of systems 
for preventing landslide disasters (FY92- FY96), 
  -  the 
development of technology for evaluating fire-prevention and 
fire-resistant performance (new, FY93-FY97), 
  -  the development 
of an exterior tile and stone setting system that uses organic 
adhesives (joint government-private research, FY93-FY95), and 
  -  the development of suction prevention sheets for river dikes 
(construction technology evaluation system). 

<H5>    C. Technology Development Incentives </H5>
  To promote technology development in the private sector, 
especially, the developed technologies should be put into use. 
To that end the MOC is working to provide incentives for 
private-sector technology development by utilizing the new 
technologies through efforts such as technology application 
pilot projects and the test field system. 
<H5>  1. Technology Application Pilot Projects </H5>
  Since FY87 the MOC has been implementing technology 
application pilot projects, which apply newly developed 
technologies at construction sites. During FY92 the MOC 
formulated technology application themes based on government 
needs, the objective of which was to give further impetus to the 
private sector's technology development strength, and then 
broadly invited the private sector's proposals along the lines 
of those themes. During FY93 the MOC plans to implement as 
"specific technology application pilot projects" those of the 
proposed new private-sector technologies that it investigated 
and certified. 
<H5>  2. Test Field System </H5>
  Targeting the technologies for which future government needs 
will be high and for which there is a need to raise the degree 
of perfection through on-site verification, the MOC will provide 
test fields in actual construction sites, and in FY93 will 
institute the "Test Field System." Through that system the MOC 
will construct actual-scale structures and conduct various types 
of tests. 
<H5>  3. Improving the Bidding and Contracting System </H5>
  In order to facilitate the private sector's technology 
development and actively use those results, "a bidding system 
that emphasizes technological strength," "a bidding system that 
makes full use of private-sector technology development," and "a 
bidding system that includes the contents of technology 
proposals in the decision-making process" were proposed in the 
Central Construction Industry Council's November 1992 report 
entitled "The Basic Model of a Bidding and Contracting System," 
which was in response to the (first) report "How the 
Construction Industry Should Be To Cope With New Social and 
Economic Factors." 
<H5>  4. Tax System Facilitating Technology Development </H5>
  In order to actively facilitate technology development in 
the 
private sector, the period of applicability of a special tax 
deduction system for cases where test research expenses 
increased and other such cases was extended two years (until 31 
March 1995). New tax deduction systems for test research 
expenses disbursed for joint research with national laboratories 
and for recycling-related test research will also be established 
to support technology development in the private sector. 
<H5>  D. Conclusion </H5>
  Based on the future vision for construction technology 
development that has prospects for the 21st century, the MOC 
will actively promote government-private joint technology 
development, centering on that which is aimed at the development 
objectives relating to the highest-priority research themes.
