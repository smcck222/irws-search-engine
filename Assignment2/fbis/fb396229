<H5>  A. Introduction </H5>
  1. Given the continuing severity of the tax revenue 
situation, efforts were made to thoroughly revamp and 
rationalize expenditures in the draft of the FY93 budget so as 
to hold down the amount of bond issues as much as possible, and 
budget revisions were made with due consideration given to the 
economy. After submission at the 126th regular Diet session on 
22 January 1993 and then review by both the Upper and Lower 
Houses, the budget was passed on 31 March 1993. 
  2. The &yen;72.3548-trillion general account budget for FY93 
was an increase of &yen;136.8 billion over the year before. 
Excluding national debt costs, distributions of local allocation 
taxes, and funds transferred to the Industrial Investment 
Special Account, general expenditures amount to &yen;39.9168 
trillion, which is an increase of 3.1&percnt;, or &yen;1.2180 
trillion, over last year's original budget amount. (See Tables 1 
and 2.)

<H5>  B. Overview of FY93 Science and Technology Budgets </H5>
  The promotion of science and technology is the basis for 
socioeconomic development, and in order for Japan, a nation that 
lacks natural resources, to develop further, ways must be found 
to steadily promote S&amp;T based on a long-term outlook. 
  The FY93 S&amp;T budgets, the policies for which are 
continually 
reviewed in light of the current state of financial affairs, 
were formulated around the issue of striving for effective and 
efficient promotion of S&amp;T through the efficient, prioritized 
allocation of funds for basic and pioneering research, space 
development, ocean development, and so forth. 
  Although it is not necessarily easy to distinguish which 
outlays in the national budget are for S&amp;T budgets, here we 
will 
outline the nation's S&amp;T budgets according to the 
classifications shown in Figure 1. For the sake of convenience, 
this is based on the Science and Technology Agency's broadly 
totalized trial calculations of Japan's S&amp;T budgets, which 
also 
include those budgets within the special accounts. 
  First, "S&amp;T Promotion Expenses" is an item included 
under 
"Expenses for Education and Science," which is a major 
expenditure in the general account. These funds consist of 
outlays for national laboratories and so forth. (See Tables 3 
and 4.)

  Next, "Other R&amp;D expenditures" are research-related 
expenditures other than "S&amp;T Promotion Expenses" in the 
general 
account that include major expenditures such as "Energy Measures 
Expenses," "Expenses for Education Assistance," "Expenses for 
Economic Cooperation," "Measures for Small Business Expenses," 
and "Other Expenses." 
  In these, the "Energy Measures Expenses" were recombined 
from 
the "S&amp;T Promotion Expenses" when they were first included 
as a 
major expenditure item in FY88. These expenses consist of 
Expenses for Promotion of Research on the Peaceful Use of Atomic 
Energy, R&amp;D outlays for new energy technology and 
energy-conservation technology, and so forth. 
  S&amp;T-related expenditures in the special accounts 
consist of 
the National Schools S/A, Promotion of Electrical Power 
Resources Development S/A, Oil-Coal Industry S/A, Energy Supply 
and Demand Structural Improvement Measures S/A, and the 
Industrial Investment S/A. 
  The FY93 "S&amp;T Expenditures" amount to &yen;2.2688 
trillion, 
which is a 6.2&percnt; increase, or &yen;132.1 billion, over last

Notes: 1. Investments in special corporations in the S&amp;T-related budgets within the Industrial Investment Special Account, which is 
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, are tallied under the ministry or agency under whose jurisdiction the corporation 
comes. However, there are overlapping tallies for specific biological industrial technology research promotion organizations that 
are jointly run by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and for the Japan Key Technology Center, which is under MITI 
and MPT. (But there are no overlaps in the totals.)

<H5>  C. Summary of S&amp;T Promotion Expenses </H5>
<H5>  1. Overview </H5>
  As stated above, the FY93 "S&amp;T Promotion Expenses" 
amount to 
&yen;594.4 billion, which is an increase of 8.5&percnt;, or 
&yen;46.6 
billion, over last year's initial budget. 
  The S&amp;T Promotion Expenses are broken down into the 
following 
categories: Space Development Expenses, Ocean Development 
Expenses, Large-Scale Industrial Technology Expenses, Expenses 
for Computer Industry Promotion, Expenses for Each Ministry's 
Research Institutes, Special Coordination Funds for Promoting 
S&amp;T, Subsidies and Commissions for S&amp;T Research 
Expenses, and 
Other Expenses. In addition to promoting basic and pioneering 
research, the idea is to endeavor in the R&amp;D of science and 
technology that answers the needs of the age, centering on space 
development, ocean development, the development of large-scale 
industrial technology, and computer R&amp;D. The active 
promotion of 
measures to counter cancer is also encouraged. 
  Tables 7 and 8 give a breakdown of these by item and by the 
ministry or agency in charge.

<H5>  2. Space Development Expenses </H5>
  (1) Overview 
  A total of &yen;165.935 billion (initial FY92 budget, 
&yen;151.863 billion) are appropriated for space development and 
to promote R&amp;D centering around the National Space 
Development 
Agency (NASDA). (See Table 9) 
  NASDA drives activities such as the development of an H-II 
rocket capable of launching a 2-ton geostationary satellite, and 
the development of a J-I rocket capable of launching a 1-ton 
satellite into low orbit; participation in the Space Station 
Project; the development of Engineering Test Satellite VI 
(ETS-VI), the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5), 
Advanced Earth Observation Satellite (ADEOS), and the Tropical 
Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM); the R&amp;D for ETS-VII and an 
inter-satellite optical communications experiment satellite; and 
the maintenance of earth-based facilities for satellite and 
rocket development. 
  The National Aerospace Laboratory (STA) is continuing 
research on elemental technologies for innovative aerospace 
transport. 
  The work of the Meteorological Agency (MOT) includes 
carrying 
out observations using geostationary meteorological satellites. 
The Communications Research Laboratory (MPT) is involved in the 
R&amp;D of advanced satellite communications technology. 
  (2) National Space Development Agency (NASDA) 
  Government funding and subsidies for NASDA, which plays a 
central role in space development, total &yen;152.184 billion 
and account for the majority of the &yen;165.935 billion for 
space development expenses in the Expenses for Promotion of 
S&amp;T. 
  Table 10 summarizes the NASDA expenses (the Treasury 
disbursements part). However, a more concrete look at the 
government budget for NASDA gives the following as the main 
items. (The total FY93 NASDA operating expenses, including that 
borne by the private sector, amount to &yen;158.805 billion.) 
  (a) Satellite development, etc. 
  (1) ETS-VI (&yen;10.862 &yen;12.493 billion, to be 
launched in FY94) 
  (2) GMS-5 (&yen;1.138 &yen;1.506 billion, to be launched 
in FY94) 
  (3) ADEOS (&yen;11.833 &yen;11.887 billion, to be 
launched in FY95) 
  (4) Communications and Broadcasting Engineering Test 
Satellite (COMETS) (&yen;1.376 &yen;4.121 billion, to be 
launched in FY96) 
  (5) TRMM (&yen;874 &yen;919 million, to be launched in 
FY97) 
  (6) ETS-VII (&yen;1.046 &yen;2,754 billion, to be 
launched about FY97) 
  (7) Inter-satellite optical communications experiment 
satellite (0 &yen;181 million, to be launched in FY96) 
  (b) Satellite-launching rocket development 
  H-II rocket (&yen;28.130 &yen;16.934 billion) 
  J-1 rocket (&yen;434 million &yen;3.251 billion) 
  (c) Space Station development and operation (&yen;27,627 
&yen;44.644 billion) 
<H5>  (3) Total FY93 Government Space-Related Budget </H5>
  General account space development expenses appropriated in 
every kind of expenditure except "Expenses for Promotion of 
S&amp;T" 
amount to &yen;167.148 billion (FY92 initial budget, 
&yen;153.102 billion). Furthermore, the total amount of space 
development expenses when the Transfer to the National Schools 
Special Account is included are &yen;201.700 billion (FY92 
initial budget, &yen;189.475 billion). (See Table 10.)

  (2) Main Projects 
  A summary of the main ocean development projects follows. 
  (a) Deep-Sea Submersible R&amp;D (&yen;6.076 &yen;5.215 
billion) 
  The R&amp;D of deep-sea survey technology is carried out at 
JAMSTEC based on the operation of the "Shinkai 2000," a 
2,000-meter-class submersible; its mother ship, the 
"Natsushima"; the "Dolphin 3K," a 3,000-meter unmanned probe; 
the "Shinkai 6500," a 6,000-meter-class submersible; and the 
"Kaiko," a 10,000-meter-class unmanned probe. 
  (b) Deep-Sea Environment R&amp;D (&yen;869 1,912 million) 
  JAMSTEC is doing basic research to elucidate the ecology of 
deep-sea organisms and is driving the construction of the 
Deep-Sea Research Building that is needed for those efforts. 
  (c) Kuroshio Development and Utilization Research Studies 
(&yen;118 118 million) 
  The STA, Fisheries Agency, Meteorological Agency, and 
Maritime Safety Agency are carrying out research studies on the 
Kuroshio Current, which has a great influence on Japan's 
weather, fisheries, and marine transport. The studies focus on 
the Kuroshio's energy, purification capabilities, fluctuation 
mechanisms, biological production mechanisms, and 
marine-atmospheric interactions. The agencies are studying and 
evaluating the marine characteristics of the Kuroshio region 
that will become the basis for development. 
  (d) Marine Observation Technology R&amp;D (&yen;1.752 2.170 
billion) 
  JAMSTEC promotes the research and development of observation 
technology for the purpose of understanding ocean fluctuations, 
which are closely related to fluctuations in the global 
environment, e.g., comprehensive observation and research 
studies on the North Pacific and the Arctic Ocean. 
  (3) Total FY93 Government Budget for Ocean Development 
  Ocean development general account expenses appropriated in 
every kind of expenditure except "Expenses for Promotion of 
S&amp;T" 
amount to &yen;59.074 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;56.197 
billion). Furthermore, the total amount of ocean development 
expenses when the Transfer to the National Schools Special 
Account is included is &yen;74.442 billion (FY92 initial budget, 
&yen;71.142 billion). 
<H5>  4. Large-Scale Industrial Technology Expenses </H5>
  These are the expenditures needed for the programmatic and 
efficient promotion of the R&amp;D of technologies for which 
there 
is great need nationally. With the government as the main player 
working in close cooperation with industry and universities, 
these projects involve the large-scale, advanced technologies 
that will become the core of Japan's economic and social 
development. &yen;688 million in total are appropriated to MITI 
for these expenses (FY92 initial budget, &yen;570 million). 
  During FY93, these efforts include the R&amp;D of a 
manganese 
nodule mining system, an advanced material processing and 
machining system, methods of producing functional chemical 
products (utilizing marine organisms), a supersonic/hypersonic 
transport propulsion system, underground space development 
technology, advanced chemical processing technology, human 
sensory measurement application technology, and ultimate 
manipulation of atoms and molecules. 
<H5>  5. Expenses for Computer Industry Promotion </H5>
  To promote the R&amp;D of basic technologies for improving 
Japan's computer technology, &yen;1.098 billion (FY92 initial 
budget, &yen;1.158 billion) are appropriated. The goal is to 
establish new information-processing technologies 
(four-dimensional computers) that will be indispensable in the 
advanced information society of the 21st century. 
<H5>  6. Expenses for Each Ministry's Research Institutes </H5>
  The expenditures in FY93 for each ministry's research 
institutes, excluding the aforementioned space development and 
marine development expenses, amount to &yen;192.578 billion 
(FY92 initial budget, &yen;183.632 billion). These funds are 
used to equip each department's research facilities and to 
encourage research activities. In these appropriations, 
&yen;1.499 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;1.476 billion) are 
to go for Expenses for National Organizations' Test Research on 
Pollution Prevention, etc. (the Environment Agency's lumped sum). 
  These funds will also drive continued R&amp;D efforts on 
superconductive materials R&amp;D in the STA and other agencies. 
  Furthermore, the funds will be used for continuing the 
implementation of basic and pioneering research in biotechnology 
by the MAFF and to strengthen support for such R&amp;D by private 
firms; to expand joint research that is based on tie-ups among 
industry, government, and universities; and, with respect to 
MITI's next-generation projects, to promote continuing R&amp;D in 
fields such as new materials and biotechnology. (See Table 12)

<H5>  7. Special Coordination Funds for Promoting S&amp;T </H5>
  Reflecting the increasing importance of R&amp;D 
coordination from 
an overall perspective as S&amp;T becomes more advanced and 
complex 
in recent years, the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting 
S&amp;T were established in FY81 for the purpose of effectivating 
comprehensive coordination that drives the important research 
work required for the promotion of S&amp;T along the guidelines 
of 
the Science Council of Japan. 
  In FY93 &yen;13.300 billion (FY91 initial budget, 
&yen;11.000 
billion) are appropriated for further expanding Japan's S&amp;T 
by 
efforts such as promoting the cultivation of centers of 
excellence (COEs), where the world's scientific elite gather to 
reveal to the rest of the world the results of their basic 
research. 
  Incidentally, the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting 
S&amp;T are a shifting budget of undetermined expenditure items. 
After the items are decided, the funds are used by shifting them 
to the organizations of each ministry and agency. 
<H5>  8. Subsidies and Commissions for S&amp;T Research Expenses </H5>
  &yen;73.944 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;64.955 
billion) are appropriated for scientific research expense 
subsidies, which give special consideration to support of 
scientific research in universities and support of technology 
development in the private sector, and for International 
Deep-Sea Excavation Project Apportionments (MOE). These outlays 
are also to be used to support the Japan Society for the 
Promotion of Science (JSPS): the number of special research 
members are to be broadly expanded for the purpose of ensuring 
the cultivation of brilliant young researchers who will propel 
original scientificresearch. 
  In addition, these expenditures appropriate &yen;3.819 
billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;3.815 billion) as donations 
to organizations participating in the international Human 
Frontier Science Program, which was established in Strasbourg, 
France, for the purpose of promoting joint international basic 
research that involves elucidating the superior functions of 
living organisms. These expenditures also appropriate funds for 
test research, including research in biotechnology, and the 
development of various other technologies by the private sector. 
<H5>  9. Other Expenses </H5>
  These "other" expenditures fund building construction and 
the 
production of an accelerator for a large-scale radiation 
facility at RIKEN and the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute 
(JAERI), in addition to appropriating &yen;2.701 billion (FY92 
initial budget, &yen;2.307 billion) for frontier research at the 
Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) and 
&yen;6.861 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;6.283 billion) for 
adding four new research themes to the Exploratory Research for 
Advanced Technology Operation (ERATO) Projects of the Research 
Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC), the purposes of which 
are to promote basic, pioneering research and to facilitate 
cooperation among industry, government, and universities and

  The funds are also to be used for continuing R&amp;D work on 
medical equipment technology and global environmental industrial 
technology at the New Energy and Industrial Technology 
Development Organization (NEDO), and for projects promoting the 
development and practical use of new medical equipment 
technology. 
  As for the 35th Antarctic Observation, &yen;3.532 billion 
(FY92 initial budget, &yen;3.531 billion) are appropriated for 
continuing routine observations with priority given to promoting 
research on snow ice, physical geography, and the living 
organisms of sea ice regions. (See Table 13) 
  Then, &yen;14.342 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;12.737 
billion) are appropriated for the fight against cancer based on 
the "Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy." (See Table 14)

<H5>  D. Energy Measures Expenses </H5>
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Research-related expenses in the Energy Measures Expenses 
FY93 include the Expenses for Promotion of Research on the 
Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy and the Expenses for New Energy 
Technology. These include &yen;155.067 billion for the STA, 
&yen;826 million for MITI, and &yen;4.222 million for the MOF 
(allotments and contributions to international organizations), 
which total &yen;160.115 billion. 
<H3>  2. Expenses for Promotion of Research on the Peaceful Use of 
Atomic Energy </H3>
  (1) Safety Research 
  &yen;17.357 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;18.632 
billion) are appropriated for research for ensuring the safety 
of nuclear power. JAERI and the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation (PNC) are central in carrying out 
industrial safety research, environmental radiation safety 
research, and research on the safety of radioactive wastes. 
  (2) Development of New-Type Power Reactors 
  &yen;28.986 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;28.980 
billion) are appropriated as investments and subsidies for the 
PNC's Power Reactor Development Department to promote the 
R&amp;D of 
fast breeder reactors (FBRs) and other new types of power 
reactors. 
  (3) Development of Nuclear Fuels 
  &yen;22.631 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;22.929 
billion) in investments and subsidies are appropriated for the 
PNC as necessary outlays for R&amp;D to establish a nuclear fuel 
cycle, which entails promoting uranium mining, the R&amp;D of 
uranium enrichment technology, and the development of technology 
for producing FBR fuel. 
  (4) Fusion Research 
  &yen;21.756 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;21.535 
billion) are appropriated as necessary outlays for fusion 
research that centers around JAERI and involves use of a 
higher-performance critical plasma device, and joint efforts in 
the engineering design of the International Thermal-Fusion 
Experimental Reactor (ITER). Fusion research is being carried 
out at Osaka University and other universities, the total budget 
for which is &yen;12.726 billion (FY92 initial budget, 
&yen;10.566 billion). (See Table 15) 
  (5) Nuclear-Powered Ship Research 
  &yen;3.750 billion (FY92 initial budget, &yen;3.539 billion) 
are appropriated as the necessary outlays for continuing 
research on a nuclear-powered ship at JAERI. This involves 
analyzing the data obtained from the experimental voyage of the 
"Mutsu" nuclear-powered ship. 
<H5>  3. Expenses for New Energy Technology </H5>
  In order to contribute to solving global environmental 
problems and to find ways to stably secure energy in the future 
by developing solar, geothermal, coal, hydrogen, and other such 
new energies, &yen;513 million (FY92 initial budget, &yen;691 
million) are appropriated for the R&amp;D of technologies for 
these 
new energies. 
<H5>  4. Expenses for Energy-Conservation Technology </H5>
  In order to promote the development of energy-conservation 
technology, &yen;282 million (FY92 initial budget, &yen;278 
million) are appropriated for R&amp;D of large-scale 
energy-conservation technology. 
<H5>  E. Other Research-Related Expenses </H5>
  Other research-related expenses in addition to the Expenses 
for Energy Measures include National Schools Research Expenses, 
which are appropriated in the National Schools S/A; 
research-related expenses that center on investments and 
subsidies for the PNC, which are appropriated in the Measures 
for Promoting Electrical Power Development S/A; and investments 
in the Japan Information Center of Science and Technology 
(JICST) and the Japan Key Technology Center, which are 
appropriated in the Industrial Investment Special Account. A 
breakdown of those major items by ministry/agency is given in 
Table 16. 
<H5>  (Reference) Global Environmental Preservation Budgets </H5>
  International efforts to solve global environmental problems 
such as global warming, destruction of the ozone layer, and acid 
rain continue to become more concrete. From the viewpoint of 
actively and comprehensively tackling these problems, the 
necessary expenses are regarded as priority items. According to 
data compiled by the Environment Agency, the FY93 global 
environmental preservation budgets of all the ministries and 
agencies total &yen;542.6 billion, which is an 8.9&percnt; 
increase 
over the &yen;498.4 billion in FY92. (See Table 17) In that, 
general expenses excluding energy measures and satellite R&amp;D 
expenses are &yen;108.6 billion, which is &yen;20.6 billion or 
24.3&percnt; more than the &yen;88.0 billion in the FY92 budget.

  The aim of the Science Council of Japan (SCJ), "as an 
organization that represents Japan's scientists at home and 
abroad, is to advance science and to make science reflect in and 
permeate through the administration, industry, and the 
lifestyles of the Japanese people." 
  The total SCJ budget for FY93 is &yen;1,095.827 million, 
which is &yen;53.345 million less than its FY92 budget of 
&yen;1,042.482 million. 
  The main increases in the SCJ budget were in the 
Consultation-Related Expenses and International Scientific 
Exchange Expenses (international contributions, and sponsoring 
the Asia Scientific Conference (temporary name)). There were 
decreases in International Scientific Exchange Expenses for 
holding conferences within Japan. 
  The budget amounts are shown in the table below, and an 
outline of the major items follows.

<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  The amount of budget spending for the Science and Technology 
Agency (STA) in the FY93 general account budget is &yen;437.575 
billion, which is an increase of 6.2&percnt;, or &yen;25.709 
billion, 
over the year before. In addition, &yen;140.202 billion in the 
Promotion of Electrical Power Resources Development S/A are 
appropriated for STA expenses; and &yen;3.800 billion in the 
Industrial Investment S/A for the Japan Information Center of 
Science and Technology (JICST). The combined amount of STA 
outlays from all the accounts above, &yen;581.577 billion, is an 
increase of 5.4&percnt; or &yen;29.799 billion over the previous 
year's initial budget of &yen;551.778 billion. In addition, as 
contract authorizations, &yen;132.702 billion in the general 
account, and &yen;29.957 billion in the Electrical Power 
Resources Development S/A are appropriated. The table below 
shows the STA budget in terms of the main items. In FY93, 
however, the Japanese government is emphasizing contribution to 
the international community from the aspect of S&amp;T, and 
promotion of S&amp;T aimed at a more comfortable way of living. 
The 
main axis of that is the promotion of richly creative S&amp;T, 
centering around the strengthening of basic research, that was 
indicated in the S&amp;T Policy Outline (April 1992 Cabinet 
decision).

<H3>  B. Strengthening Innovative, Basic Research and Maintaining 
the S&amp;T Promotion Base </H3>
  &yen;16.169 (11.921) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;59.105 (51.117) billion 
  Because new scientific and technological knowledge in the 
form of humankind's common intellectual property becomes the 
cornerstone for Japan's and the world's continued advancement in 
the 21st century, the STA will work to promote innovative basic 
research and to maintain the S&amp;T promotion base. 
<H3>  1. Expanding Special Coordination Funds for Promoting 
S&amp;T To 
Organize a System for Fostering Centers of Excellence </H3>
  &yen;13.300 (11.000) billion 
  In order for Japan to strengthen its S&amp;T activities and 
to be 
a source from which excellent research results are transmitted, 
it must foster centers of excellence (COEs) that have eminent 
research leaders, the latest research information, excellent 
research facilities and equipment, and well-rounded research 
support systems. To effectively foster COEs in Japan under a 
competitive environment, the Special Coordination Funds for 
Promoting S&amp;T will be expanded to organize this new system. 
In 
the case where a national laboratory has its own concrete plan 
and works toward becoming a COE, in order to firmly facilitate 
that plan the STA will put priority on taking steps to provide 
the funds needed for test research, filling out the research 
support system, accepting researchers from outside the 
laboratory, establishing an accurate assessment system, etc. 
<H3>  2. Expanding Important, Basic Research Promotion Programs 
such as the Innovative S&amp;T Promotion Program </H3>
  &yen;12.806 (11.155) billion 
  The Innovative S&amp;T Promotion Program is the STA's 
attempt to 
organize researchers from industry, government, and universities 
and researchers from overseas for fixed periods of time under 
eminent project leaders for the purpose of bringing forth the 
seeds of innovative technology, and then to promote innovative 
basic research that fully demonstrates the researchers' 
creativity. For that purpose &yen;6.861 billion are appropriated 
to the Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC). During 
FY93, research on 18 themes will continue and research on four 
new themes will begin. The STA will also expand the JRDC's 
Precursory Research for Embryonic S&amp;T Program (PRESTO). 
PRESTO 
involves widely recruiting researchers from around Japan, then 
strictly selecting from those excellent researchers with truly 
original ideas and allowing them to freely implement their own 
individual research for fixed periods of time. Along with that 
the STA will expand RIKEN's Protea Research System, in which 
researchers from many fields are brought together to carry out 
in a fluid manner advanced and basic research in untrodden areas 
for long periods of time. 
  Furthermore, the STA will continue to promote the Basic 
Science Special Researcher Program at RIKEN, which provides a 
place where young researchers can do subjective research (75 
people accepted), and will expand the S&amp;T Special Researcher 
Program, which accepts young researchers at national 
laboratories for the purpose of strengthening basic research 
(150 people accepted). 
<H5>  3. Facilitating Research Exchange </H5>
  &yen;5.034 (4.165) billion 
  In order for researchers to fully demonstrate their 
creativity, ways must be found to further facilitate research 
exchange with industry, government, and universities, and other 
countries. 
  To that end, in addition to its usual work on international 
research exchange, the STA will begin efforts within the JRDC to 
send Japanese researchers to research organizations and national 
laboratories overseas, assist in the international and domestic 
exchange of researchers from different fields for the purpose of 
feeling out new research areas, equip the "International Plaza 
for Intelligent `Contact Detonation'" for research exchange, and 
facilitate joint research. 
  The STA will also work to promote special government-private 
joint research programs, which drive joint research between the 
private sector and national laboratories under the STA, and will 
effectively promote research based on programs such as the guest 
research official system. 
  Furthermore, building upon the research results from 
programs 
such as that for innovative S&amp;T promotion, the JRDC will 
organize loose coalitions with private firms working in 
different types of industries and will use the energy of the 
private sector to conduct tests. The STA will continue to 
promote systems for developing the results of advanced research 
(high-tech consortiums), which are a way to establish new 
technology organizations and peripheral patents. In addition, 
the STA will commission development using distinguished research 
results, and will facilitate the establishment of new technology 
firms by acting as a go-between. 
<H5>  4. Maintaining the S&amp;T Promotion Base </H5>
  &yen;16.169 (11.291) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;29.990 (26.240) billion 
  (1) Improving Research Facilities, Starting With 
Deterioration Countermeasures 
  &yen;2.437 (1.769) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;6.273 (5.808) billion 
  To cope with the increasing obsolescence and deterioration 
of 
the national laboratories' research facilities and make those 
facilities more sophisticated, the STA is proceeding with 
systematic maintenance of research facilities, e.g., its 
five-year research facilities maintenance plan. 
  (2) Expanding Per-Person Research Expenses 
  &yen;6.693 (6.463) billion 
  The per-person research expenses, which are the ordinary 
research funds that form the foundation for basic research 
activities in the national laboratories and other such research 
organizations, will be the same for all ministries and agencies 
and will be increased by &yen;40,000 to &yen;1.515 million for 
Experimental-I (physics and engineering) researchers. 
  (3) Expanding S&amp;T Talent Measures 
  &yen;3 million (0) 
  While the demand for researchers and engineers is expected 
to 
increase enormously from now on, the younger generation's 
interest in S&amp;T is declining. For that reason the STA will 
study 
measures for heightening the younger generation's interest in 
S&amp;T. The STA will also promote measures for fostering and 
securing talent, e.g., surveys and analyses of ways for young 
people to know the joy of doing science. 
  (4) Large-Scale Radiation Facility (SPring-8) Construction 
  &yen;13.733 (10.152) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;9.009 (7.048) billion 
  The SPring-8 large-scale radiation facility is an important 
facility that will help bring forth dramatic results in a wide 
range of basic research fields centering around materials 
S&amp;T, 
the life sciences, information and electronics S&amp;T, optical 
S&amp;T, 
and atomic energy R&amp;D. The facility will also be available 
for 
joint international use. RIKEN and JAERI are continuing their 
collaborative efforts on the related R&amp;D work, production of 
the 
accelerator, construction of the building, etc. 
  (5) Facilitating More Advanced R&amp;D Functions in Regions 
  &yen;1.663 (1.219) billion 
  Along with expanding fluid regional research, as the 
research 
that uses Special Coordination Funds for Promoting S&amp;T to 
help 
improve the lifestyles of the people in the regions, the STA 
will work to make the R&amp;D functions in the regions more 
advanced 
by improving information exchange, centering around research 
information networks that will be constructed within regions and 
between regions and the Tsukuba Science City, and by 
facilitating the establishment of new technology firms. In 
addition, as the regional expansion of RIKEN's frontier 
research, in the Nagoya district the STA will begin "Biomimetic 
Control Research" to study the core of the cerebral base that 
controls the movement and behavior of animals. The STA will also 
continue to promote regional joint R&amp;D projects in which the 
Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC) and 
regional public entities are collaborating. 
  (6) Facilitating the Distribution of S&amp;T Information 
  &yen;6.349 (5.702) billion 
  (&yen;3.8 billion of which is from the Industrial Investment 
S/A) 
  In the Japan Information Center of Science and Technology 
(JICST) the STA is working to set up comprehensive document 
databases, fact databases, etc., and to facilitate the 
nation-wide distribution of S&amp;T information by developing new 
technology for providing and distributing information on-line. 
  In addition, the STA will expand the English-language 
database for the document information generated in Japan, and 
distribute that information through an international S&amp;T 
information network (STN) that was built in cooperation with 
U.S. and European information-providing organizations. Along 
with that, the STA will also promote the operation of a machine 
translation system. 
<H3>  C. Contributing to the International Community Through 
S&amp;T </H3>
  &yen;105.500 (92.685) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;127.800 (97.683) billion 
  Based on Japan's international standpoint, the STA will 
promote the following policies as its doctrine of actively 
contributing to the international community through S&amp;T by 
taking the initiative in globalizing S&amp;T. 
<H5>  1. Comprehensive Promotion of International Research Exchange </H5>
  &yen;3.773 (3.220) billion 
  (1) Establishing the Framework for a Wide-Area International 
Research Cooperation Network 
  In order for Japan's research organizations and the research 
organizations of other countries to work together in an 
organically linked manner on topics that are common to many 
regions, such as earth S&amp;T, the STA will establish a 
framework 
for a wide-area international research cooperation network 
(global research network) that will be funded by the Special 
Coordination Funds for Promoting S&amp;T. Based on that system, 
the 
STA will set R&amp;D topics, build researcher and information 
networks among many research organizations spread across the 
nations in which there are regions involved in international 
exchange, and proceed with R&amp;D. 
  (2) Facilitating International Exchange Among Researchers 
  &yen;3.184 (2.664) billion 
  In order to invigorate S&amp;T cooperation with 
Asian-Pacific 
countries, the former Soviet Union, etc., the STA will recruit 
researchers who have shown results in overseas S&amp;T 
cooperation 
and who want to become involved in research exchange with an 
applicable region, send such researchers to research 
organizations that need research cooperation, and establish

<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  The fields of S&amp;T for promoting environmental 
conservation 
measures can be broadly divided into the following: that which 
relates to the development of pollution-prevention technology 
for curbing the emissions of air and water pollutants, for 
appropriate waste disposal and recycling, and for reducing noise 
and vibration; that which relates to the development of 
technology for monitoring and measuring various kinds of 
pollutants; that which assesses the impact of environmental 
pollutants on humans, plants, and animals, and clarifies the 
qualities of a preferable environment; that which relates to the 
elucidation of environmental pollution mechanisms, e.g., the 
behavior of various kinds of pollutants in ecosystems, and the 
purification functions of nature; that which relates to the 
preservation of natural environments; and that which relates to 
preservation of the global environment. 
  Research in these fields is now broadly carried out by the 
government, regional public groups, and the private sector. The 
government has started basic research to grasp the effects of 
pollution and to elucidate the mechanisms of pollution. It 
carries out research studies, which will form the basis for 
promoting national policies that would include setting various 
kinds of standards, and does basic research with the emphasis on 
the development and evaluation of pollution-prevention 
technology. The Environment Agency comprehensively coordinates 
Japan's pollution-prevention-related test research through the 
distribution of Expenses for National Organizations' Test 
Research on Pollution Prevention, etc., which are appropriated 
in a lump sum to the agency. Using Coordination Funds for 
Promoting General Research Studies on Environmental 
Conservation, the Environment Agency comprehensively coordinates 
research relating to the preservation of the global environment. 
With Expenses for Research Studies on Pollution Prevention, 
etc., the agency implements the research studies needed for 
setting various kinds of standards, and it carries out relevant 
test research at its affiliated research institutes, the 
National Environmental Research Institute and the National 
Minamata Disease Research Center.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The FY93 general account budget of the Environment Agency is 
&yen;63.673 billion. In that, the S&amp;T budget relating to 
environmental conservation amounts to &yen;12.575 billion; see 
Table 1 for a breakdown. 
  The major items in Table 1 are described below. 
<H3>  B. Expenses for National Organizations' Test Research on 
Pollution Prevention, etc. </H3>
  &yen;1,918,043,000 (&yen;1,928,043,000) 
  The fields of S&amp;T covered in environmental conservation 
research extend over a broad range, from physics and engineering 
to medicine, biology, and agriculture. Because these research 
fields are closely inter-related, the researchers and research 
organizations involved must find ways to work together closely. 
  For this reason a part of the Environment Agency's 
comprehensive coordination of Japan's policies on environmental 
conservation is to regulate guidelines for concerned ministries' 
and agencies' estimates on pollution prevention and the 
protection and maintenance of natural environments (the latter 
is referred to as "pollution prevention, etc." below). The 
expenses for test research on pollution prevention, etc., at the 
research organizations of concerned ministries and agencies and 
the expenses for those ministries and agencies to commission 
research on pollution prevention, etc., are appropriated in a 
lump sum to the Environment Agency. Through the distribution of 
those funds, the Environment Agency comprehensively coordinates 
Japan's test research relating to pollution prevention. 
  The FY93 Expenses for National Organizations' Test Research 
on Pollution Prevention, etc., which total &yen;1.918 billion, 
are for 46 research institutes under 12 ministries and agencies 
to carry out research on 91 topics that cover a broad range of 
environmental science: development of pollution-prevention 
technology, development of monitoring and measurement 
technology, assessment of the impact of environmental pollution 
on living organisms, elucidation of environmental pollution 
mechanisms, development of methods for managing natural 
environments, etc. 
  The test research based on this funding has always given 
consideration to anticipated problems based on a long-term view, 
and not just to cope with immediate problems. In order to 
further reinforce the goal-oriented nature of environmental 
research on topics that are inter-related and for which 
administrative needs are high, the Environment Agency strives to 
comprehensively promote test research with organic linkage among 
research topics by organizing research projects that integrate 
all the fields. 
  During FY93 the Environment Agency will promote 10 
comprehensive research projects. The components of those 
projects are shown in Table 2. 
  In addition, starting in FY93 the Environment Agency will 
implement "Local-Contact Environmental Research." In this effort 
national laboratories and regional public groups will 
collaborate in research on environmental problems in the regions. 
  Next, we will give an outline of each research project.

groundwater pollution mechanisms in snow belts, etc., as 
"Local-Contact Environmental Research" in which the government 
and regional public groups collaborate in research on 
environmental problems in the regions. 
<H3>  C. Expenses for Research Studies on Pollution Prevention, 
etc. </H3>
  &yen;1,465,972,000 (&yen;1,454,959,000) 
  The Environment Agency uses these funds for research studies 
on the health effects of environmental pollutants, technology 
for measuring various kinds of pollutants, elucidating the 
mechanisms of environmental pollution, etc., the purpose of 
which is to contribute toward setting the various standards 
needed in driving the agency's administration. The funds are 
also used to develop satellite-mounted research equipment for 
observing the ozone layer, and, in FY93, to conduct research 
studies on the effects of agricultural chemicals on wildlife. 
  In connection with the preservation of natural environments, 
during FY93 the Environment Agency will conduct research studies 
on ways to preserve and manage farm and pasture land in natural 
scenic areas. 
<H3>  D. Coordination Funds for Promoting Comprehensive Research 
Studies on Environmental Conservation </H3>
  &yen;109,000,000 (&yen;109,000,000) 
  These funds are used for facilitating the research studies 
that are indispensable in the smooth promotion of comprehensive 
environmental conservation measures that necessitates the 
cooperation of several ministries and agencies. The funds are 
for the Environment Agency to regulate the guidelines given to 
concerned ministries and agencies on how they should estimate 
expenses pertaining to pollution prevention, etc., and to do 
research studies for the purpose of dealing with emergency cases 
that arise after the Expenses for National Organizations' Test 
Research on Pollution Prevention, etc., are appropriated in a 
lump sum. 
<H3>  E. Expenses for Comprehensive Promotion of Global 
Environmental Research </H3>
  &yen;2.1 billion (&yen;1.9 billion) 
  As global warming, the decline of tropical forests, and 
other 
such global environmental problems are noted in agreements made 
at ministerial meetings about the preservation of the global 
environment, there is a need for the promotion of comprehensive 
research that links the all-round efforts of researchers in 
every field. 
  Accordingly, these expenses are for the promotion of 
comprehensive global environmental research that aims for 
ongoing cooperation among the researchers of national 
laboratories as well as university researchers. These funds are 
used for the entire government's research studies on the 
preservation of the global environment that are formulated at 
ministerial meetings. Based upon the research trends in Japan 
and abroad, such as the "Comprehensive Promotion Plan" 
pertaining to observation and monitoring, these funds are 
apportioned to research organizations and researchers in all 
related fields in accordance with the "Global Environmental 
Research Plan" drafted by the Environment Agency. 
<H5>  F. National Environmental Research Institute </H5>
  &yen;6,328,107,000 (&yen;5,910,231,000) 
<H5>  1. Maintenance, Expansion of Research System </H5>
  In March, 1974, the National Pollution Research Institute 
was 
established in Tsukuba Science City as an organization 
affiliated with the Environment Agency for the purpose of 
playing a central role in Japan's environmental research. In 
July, 1991, the National Pollution Research Institute was 
reorganized into the National Environmental Research Institute. 
The objectives in that were to add the field of environmental 
conservation to the areas of research, and to strengthen the 
research system that covers both global and regional 
environmental issues in order to meet the social and 
administrative needs of recent years. In view of the close 
linkage between training and research in environmental fields, 
the Pollution Training Institute was integrated into the 
Environmental Training Center. Then, in October, 1991, the 
Global Environmental Research Center was set up within the 
National Environmental Research Institute as Japan's central 
base for global environmental research and global environmental 
monitoring. 
  During FY93, the Environment Agency will continue equipping 
its research system. The Environment Agency will also strive to 
expand and strengthen global environmental research at the 
Global Environmental Research Center through efforts such as 
expanding global environmental monitoring and maintaining 
databases. 
<H5>  2. Expansion of Research Activities </H5>
  During FY93 the Environment Agency will conduct special 
research on the following nine themes. The last two (eight and 
nine) are new research themes that will start in FY93. 
  1) Research on the synergistic effects on ecosystems 
resulting from long-term exposure to chemicals in aquatic 
environments (FY89-FY93) 
  2) Research to elucidate and preserve aquatic ecosystem 
mechanisms in closed sea areas (FY91-FY94) 
  3) Research on the use of biotechnology for environmental 
conservation, and to assess that environmental impact (FY91-FY95) 
  4) Research on biocenological changes concomitant with 
environmental changes in bogs, and on ecosystems' mechanisms of 
maintaining stability (FY91-FY96) 
  5) Research to develop lake and pond environmental 
indicators and to elucidate new lake and pond environmental 
problems (FY92-FY96) 
  6) Research to evaluate the amount of exposure to 
organochlorine compounds in the environment, and the compound 
health effects of that exposure (FY92-FY96) 
  7) Environmental sanitation research on environmental 
stress and health effects due to noise and air pollution in 
urban environments (FY92-FY95) 
  8) Research to elucidate air and water problems in cities 
seen from the changes in the structures of environmental loads 
and research on measures to cope with those problems (FY93-FY96) 
  9) Research to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic 
respiratory illnesses due to diesel exhaust gases occur and to 
assess the risk (FY93-FY97) 
  To support its research activities the National 
Environmental 
Research Institute maintains a database containing information 
on the global environment, atmospheric pollution, water 
pollution, natural environments, etc. The institute also carries 
out international activities as Japan's center for the UN 
Environmental Program's (UNEP) International Environmental 
Information Resources Reference System (INFORTERRA) and the 
Global Environmental Resources Information Database (GRID). 
<H5>  G. National Minamata Disease Research Center </H5>
  &yen;446,444,000 (&yen;449,094,000) 
  The National Minamata Disease Research Center has been 
working to maintain a research system and round-out the contents 
of its research since it was started in 1978 as an organization 
that carries out comprehensive medical research on Minamata 
disease. During FY93 it will continue from the year before the 
following surveys and research on Minamata disease. 
  1) Clinical medical research on methods of treating 
Minamata disease 
  2) Basic medical research involving pathological studies 
of Minamata disease 
  3) Immunological research studies of Minamata disease 
  4) Gathering, organizing data on Minamata disease 
  The center now has three departments, one division, and 27 
workers. 
  Incidentally, the National Minamata Disease Research Center 
has been designated as a WHO cooperative center since September 
1987.

<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  The promotion of scientific research that centers around 
universities is a way to improve the levels of learning and to 
uncover new knowledge. It is very important as a means of 
forming a foundation for development in various social and 
national fields of interest. 
  In recent years the importance of basic research as the 
foundation that will support 21st-century Japan has been 
strongly perceived, and there are increasing expectations toward 
scientific research in every area of society. With this there is 
a need to further promote creative, pioneering scientific 
research and to actively contribute to the advance of the 
world's scientific research in correspondence with the expansion 
of Japan's international role. 
  Accordingly, the Ministry of Education (MOE) is striving to 
equip and expand the scientific research base by expanding the 
outlays for scientific research, nurturing excellent young 
researchers, rounding out research facilities, setting up 
scientific information systems, and promoting research 
cooperation with industry and international scientific exchange. 
The MOE is also actively tackling global-scale themes such as 
global environmental problems. 
  At present, in FY93, there are 84 MOE-related research 
laboratories (Table 1). The MOE's FY93 S&amp;T budget is 
&yen;1.0463 
trillion. The major items in that budget are described below.

<H5>  B. Expanding the Subsidies for Scientific Research Expenses </H5>
  The Subsidies for Scientific Research Expenses are research 
support funds for promoting Japan's science, the objective of 
which is to bring about the marked development of creative, 
pioneering scientific research in all fields from humanities and 
the social sciences to the natural sciences. These funds 
subsidize the basic research planned by university researchers 
and research groups that is regarded as especially important and 
conforms with scientific research trends. The funds are the main 
outlays for promoting scientific research at universities and 
other such organizations. 
  In the FY93 budget, &yen;73.6 billion, which is &yen;9.0 
billion more than the year before, are appropriated for the 
prioritized promotion of leading-edge research, the foundational 
expansion of scientific research, the encouragement of excellent 
research by young researchers, and so forth. 
  The main contents of those items that received increased 
funding are as follows. 
  1) Making "priority-area research" more replete in order 
to promote research in areas for which there is strong 
scientific and social demand: environmental, earth and space 
science (the environment, earth and space, energy control, 
etc.); materials science (properties of atomic nuclei, chemical 
substances, new materials, etc.); information and electronics 
science (information science and mathematics, electronic 
engineering, etc.); and the life sciences (bioscience, cancer, 
neurology, etc.). 
  \2) Making "General Research (A)," "General Research 
(B)," and "General Research (C)" more replete in order to expand 
creative, pioneering basic research and to promote humanities 
and social science research. 
  3) Making "Special Researcher Subsidies" and "Incentive 
Research (A)" more replete for special researchers nominated by 
the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) in order 
to nurture and secure young researchers. 
  4) Making "Test Research (A)" and "Test Research (B)" 
more replete in order to further facilitate test and applied 
research for which there is the possibility of those research 
results being shifted into practical applications. 
  5) Making "International Scientific Research" more 
replete in order to further facilitate international joint 
research. 
  6) Making "Expenses for Facilitating the Publication of 
Research Results" more replete in order to facilitate the 
publication of researchresults and the creation of databases. 
  7) Making "Expenses for Creative Basic Research" more 
replete in order to promote research based on new programs of 
science. 
<H5>  C. Promotion of Important Basic Research </H5>
<H5>  1. Astronomy Research </H5>
  Astronomy, one of the traditional fields of natural science, 
is an important field that helps to advance the understanding of 
space phenomena and contributes to the systemization of the 
natural laws of physics. Research in astronomy is carried out 
primarily by the National Institute of Astronomy, which was 
established in July 1988 as an inter-university research 
institute. 
  During FY93, the MOE will promote the construction of an 
eight-meter optical infrared telescope at the National 
Observatory, the objective of which is to look 15 billion light 
years into the far reaches of space to see how space looked at 
the time the Milky Way was born. 
  To further promote research on cosmic rays and elementary 
particles, at the Tokyo University Cosmic Ray Laboratory the MOE 
will promote the construction of a large water Cerenkov cosmic 
elementary particle observation device consisting of a 
50,000-ton water tank and 11,200 photomultiplier tubes 1,000 m 
underground. 
  For these efforts, &yen;4.038 billion are appropriated. 
<H5>  2. Accelerator Science </H5>
  Tristan Experimental Research (National Laboratory for 
High-Energy Physics) 
  The National Laboratory for High-Energy Physics uses the 
"Tristan" accelerator (diameter, 960 m; energy, 30 billion eV), 
which went into full-scale operation in May 1987, to carry out 
collision experiments with electrons and positrons that are 
accelerated to high energies. Then, by investigating the 
reactions that occur among elementary particles, experiments are 
conducted to explore the ultimate structure of matter and the 
relationships among the elementary forces of nature. In FY93, 
the MOE will continue to promote that experimental research. 
  For these efforts, &yen;13.023 billion are appropriated. 
<H5>  3. Space Science </H5>
  The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) will 
be involved in the production of the No. 16 scientific satellite 
(for engineering experiments, to be launched in FY95) and the 
No. 18 scientific satellite (for observational research of the 
atmosphere of Mars, to be launched in FY96), and the development 
of the No. 17 scientific satellite (for elucidation of the 
moon's internal structure, to be launched in FY97), and the 
Space Experiment and Observation Free Flyer (a multi-purpose, 
reusable unmanned spacelab for implementing astronomical 
observation, and physics and engineering experiments; to be 
launched in FY94). 
  In addition, in order to keep up with the developments in 
lunar and planetary surveys and scientific observation missions, 
the MOE will continue its development of a large rocket (M-V) 
for launching large scientific satellites. 
  For these efforts, &yen;20.646 billion are appropriated. 
<H5>  4. Fusion Research </H5>
  In order to promote research on helical-system-based nuclear 
fusion, which is expected to become a source of energy in the 
future, the MOE is proceeding with the production of a large 
helical device at the Fusion Science Research Institute. The MOE 
is also proceeding with fusion research at universities that is 
based on various other kinds of systems. 
  In addition to facilitating the production of the large 
helical device at the Fusion Science Research Institute (which 
is in the fourth year of a eight-year program), during FY93 the 
MOE will conduct fusion research using various kinds of methods. 
  For these efforts, &yen;12.819 billion are appropriated. 
<H5>  5. Ocean Science </H5>
  International Deep-Sea Excavation Program (ODP) 
  The goal of this international joint research program is to 
use the U.S. deep-sea excavation ship (Joydis Resolution 
[phonetic]) to dig up the ocean floor in various places around 
the world for the purpose of scientifically elucidating the 
long-term fluctuations in the global environment, the crustal 
structure of the ocean floor, etc. Japan's first-term projects 
will end in September 1993, then Japan will participate in the 
five-year second-term projects, which will begin in October 
1993. In addition to Japan, the U.S., UK, France, Germany, 
Canada, Russia and the European Science Foundation (12 
countries) are participating in this program (the Japanese 
organization involved is the Tokyo University's Ocean Research 
Institute). Japan has been participating in the program since 
the first-term projects, which started in October 1985. In the 
FY93 budget, an allotment of &yen;344 million (about $2.82 
million) are appropriated for Japan's continued participation. 
(As for operating expenses, see Section K-1-(b)-5.) 
<H5>  6. Prediction of Earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions </H5>
  Observational research for predicting earthquakes and 
volcanic eruptions in Japan is comprehensively and 
programmatically promoted by national universities, the 
Meteorological Agency, the Geographical Survey Institute, and 
other concerned organizations in accordance with the Earthquake 
Prediction and Volcanic Eruption Prediction Programs that the 
Geodetic Council (chairman: Satoshi Asada, Tokai University 
professor) proposed to the Education Minister and other 
concerned ministers. 
  Further repletion of observational research systems and the 
promotion of basic research for elucidating earthquakes and 
volcanic activity are pointed out in these prediction programs, 
signifying that universities should play a greater role. 
Promotion of research in this field is desired; there is not 
just scientific demand for it, but also strong social demand 
from the perspective of disaster prevention. 
  (1) Earthquake Prediction 
  Observational research for earthquake prediction is now 
promoted in accordance with the Sixth Earthquake Prediction 
Program (a five-year program from 1989 to 1993). During FY93, 
the fifth year for the program, &yen;2.027 billion are 
appropriated for rounding out earthquake prediction 
observational research at universities and other such 
organizations. 
  The main contents of that are: 
  1) Rounding out the observational research systems; 
Equipping 
the regional earthquake and volcano observation centers (Nagoya 
Univ., Physics Dept.) 
  2) Rounding out the Nagoya and Kyushu regional 
micro-earthquake observational systems 
  3) Rounding out the systems for basic research on inland 
earthquake prediction and earthquake observational research in 
the Tokyo area; Rounding out the observational facilities and 
equipment; Rounding out observational research enterprises, etc. 
  4) Rounding out other observational research enterprises 
(comprehensive observational research in south Kanto and Tokai 
regions) 
  (2) Volcanic Eruption Prediction 
  Observational research for predicting volcanic eruptions is 
now promoted in accordance with the Fourth Volcanic Eruption 
Prediction Program (a five-year program from 1989 to 1993). 
During FY93, the fifth year for the program, &yen;396 million 
are appropriated for rounding out volcanic eruption prediction 
observational research at universities and other such 
organizations. 
  The main contents of that are: 
  1) Rounding out the observational research systems; 
Equipping 
the regional earthquake and volcano observation centers (Nagoya 
Univ., Physics Dept.) 
  2) Augmenting observations of the active volcanos where 
observational research should be carried out on a priority 
basis; (Augmenting observations of Mount Kusatsu Shirane, Izu 
Oshima, Unzendake, Mount Aso, Sakurajima, etc.) 
  3) Comprehensive, concentrated observation of specific 
volcanoes (Mount Aritama, Mount Fuji) 
<H5>  7. Antarctic Observation Project </H5>
  The Antarctic Observation Project started in 1957. Now, the 
39-member 34th winter team is conducting winter-long 
observations. 
  During FY93, the 56-member 35th observation team will be 
sent, and three people will be dispatched to other countries' 
base camps. 
  In addition to routine observations of climate, the oceans, 
etc., the 35th observation will involve continuing priority 
research observations based on yearly projects such as the "Ice 
Sheet Dome Deep-Layer Excavation Observations" (the third year 
of a five-year project). 
  The rebuilding of the Showa base camp structures will 
continue (the third year of an eight-year project), and, from 
the perspective of protecting the Antarctic environment, the MOE 
will equip and maintain facilities for waste processing.

<H5>  8. Promotion of the "Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy" </H5>
  The aims of the "Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy" (decided 
upon 
in a ministerial conference on cancer countermeasures, 7 June 
1983) are to elucidate the true nature of cancer in a 10-year 
effort and to reflect those results in the prevention, 
diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. In addition to promoting 
cancer research as it has all along, the MOE in cooperation with 
concerned ministries and agencies will develop policies based on 
the strategy and will work toward achieving the objectives of 
the strategy. 
  For FY93, the 10th year of the program, a total of 
&yen;3.73100 billion are appropriated for promoting cancer 
research as a priority theme, for maintenance of the cancer 
research system in national universities, and so forth (Table 
3). Incidentally, the overall government budget for this 
program, i.e., including the expenses of the MHW and STA, is 
&yen;17.99100 billion.

<H5>  9. Promotion of Research Based on New Program Formats </H5>
  There are some remarkable developments in the state of 
affairs surrounding scientific research: the increasing social 
demand for further promotion of scientific research resulting 
from rapid socioeconomic changes, developments, and the trend 
toward attaching importance to science and technology in recent 
years; the fact that scientific research is required to play a 
pioneering role in connection with research for creating new 
technology that contributes to humankind; and the heightening 
demand for international contributions through scientific 
exchange. In order to cope appropriately with such recent trends 
and demands that surround scientific research, we must find ways 
to actively promote scientific research by dynamically and 
flexibly deciding which fields of research should be promoted in 
Japan, by investing researchers and research outlays in a 
prioritized fashion, by promoting group research, and by 
maintaining joint research systems. (A proposal made by the 
Science Council in July 1989.) 
  Accordingly, the MOE listens to the opinions of the Science 
Council and determines which research fields should be 
concretely promoted from among the types of research that will 
give rise to new, revolutionary areas of study. By means of 
formats that serve to promote group research and maintain joint 
research systems (New Program Formats), the MOE strives to 
actively promote scientific research. 
  During FY93, the MOE will promote 10 research efforts, seven 
of which are continued research efforts and three of which are 
new undertakings that will begin in FY93. 
  (Research themes continued over from FY90) 
  1) Elucidation of the dynamic mechanisms in living organisms 
(Research leader: Setsuro Ebashi, head of the Okazaki National 
Research Institutes) 
  2) Research on global environmental changes centering on the 
Asia, Pacific region (Research leader: Saburo Tamura, professor 
emeritus of Tokyo University) 
  (Research themes continued over from FY91) 
  3) Research on artificially controlled functional molecular 
systems (Research leader: Hiroo Iguchi, head of the Institute 
for Molecular Science, Okazaki National Research Institutes) 
  4) Human genome analysis research (Research leader: Ken'ichi 
Matsubara, head of the Osaka University Cell Bioengineering 
Center) 
  5) Research on the development of nano-scale structurally 
controlled functional materials (Research leader: Yuichiro 
Nishina, professor at the Tohoku University Metallic Materials 
Laboratory) 
  (Research themes continued over from FY92) 
  6) Research on "the physics of fields" using a 
special-purpose parallel computer (Research leader: Yoichi 
Iwasaki, professor at the Tsukuba University Physics Dept.) 
  7) Research on intelligent artificial objects that 
generalize 
engineering (Research leader: Tatsuo Koyama, professor at the 
Tokyo University Engineering Dept.) 
  (New research starting in FY93) 
  8) R&amp;D of a super-high-speed information communications 
network for scientific research support (Research leader: 
Seiichiro Asano, professor at NACSIS) 
  9) Molecular biology research at individual levels of 
generation and morphological formation (Research leader: 
Masatoshi Takeichi, professor at the Kyoto University Physics 
Dept.) 
  10) Design and synthesis of biofunctional molecules 
(Research 
leader: Masao Karube, professor at the Tokyo University Center 
for Advanced S&amp;T Research) 
  The FY93 budget amounts for new programs are as follows. 
  (1) Subsidies for Scientific Research Expenses (creative 
basic research expenses): &yen;2,470 million 
  (2) JSPS "Special Researchers": &yen;104 million (32 
researchers) 
  (3) Maintenance of joint research systems 


    -  Maintenance of the Human Genome Analysis Center at the 
Tokyo University Institute of Medical Science (relates to 4 
above) 
  -  Maintenance of Osaka University's genetic information 
experiment facilities (relates to 4 above) 
  -  Setting up the 
National Center for Science Information Systems (NACSIS)

  -  Setting up Kyoto University's "Molecular Generative 
Biology Research Center" (relates to 9 above) 

    In addition, international symposia for the purpose of 
promoting this research are planned. 
<H5>  D. Maintenance, Repletion of Research Facilities </H5>
  As scientific research becomes more advanced, the research 
facilities and equipment needed for that become larger and more 
expensive along with their increased performance. 
  In this regard, and as pointed out in an emergency proposal 
by the SCJ in a July 1992 report, the research facilities of 
national universities are rapidly deteriorating and becoming 
obsolete, and the maintenance and repletion of those facilities 
is an urgent issue. 
  Based on such proposals, research facilities must be 
maintained and better equipped, and the research environment 
must be made more sophisticated in order to promote scientific 
research from now on. 
  For that purpose a total of &yen;24.420 billion are 
appropriated in FY93. Those funds will be used 1) to maintain 
and equip on a priority basis the facilities for basic research 
needed for promoting more sophistication in the research 
environment of those research organizations that have shown 
excellent research results and are expected to make dramatic 
advances in the future, but cannot handle very advanced 
research; and 2) to make replete the large-scale, 
high-performance research facilities needed for the type of 
research that will uncover new research fields and will lead to 
further advances.

are 
appropriated (excluding personnel expenses). 
<H5>  F. Promotion of Research Cooperation with Industry </H5>
  Today there are various expectations and demands from all 
aspects of society toward scientific research in universities. 
While educational research has been the mission of universities 
all along, coping with the demands of society as well as 
possible under that identity while also cooperating with 
industry is significant from the standpoint of universities' 
contribution to society. It is also important in that scientific 
research at universities gains a rewarding stimulus. 
  Accordingly, the MOE actively promotes policies on research 
cooperation between universities and industry. 
<H5>  1. Setting Up Joint Research Centers </H5>
  In FY87 the MOE started equipping and maintaining joint 
research centers as places for promoting joint research with the 
private sector, commissioned research, and national 
universities' research collaboration with industry. During FY93, 
the ministry will set up joint research centers in the following

University--regional joint research center 
  -  Oita 
University--regional joint research center 

<H3>    2. Repletion of System of Joint Research with the Private 
Sector </H3>
  &yen;5.033 billion are appropriated for further repletion of 
the system of joint research with the private sector, in which 
the faculty members of national universities collaborate on an 
equal basis with researchers from private firms in research on 
common themes. This funding is &yen;85 million more than that of 
the year before. 
<H5>  3. Acceptance of Commissioned Research </H5>
  &yen;9.647 billion are appropriated for facilitating 
commissioned research, in which the faculty members of national 
universities are commissioned to do research, as public service, 
by industry or other outside organizations. This funding is 
&yen;198 million more than that of the year before. 
<H5>  4. Acceptance of Commissioned Researchers, etc. </H5>
  &yen;456 million are appropriated for expanding the 
commissioned researcher system, which provides opportunities for 
the acceptance of working engineers and researchers who receive 
research guidance at the graduate level. This funding is &yen;40 
million more than that of the year before. (The number of people 
accepted (1,529) is 50 more than that of the year before.) 
<H5>  5. Acceptance of Scholarship Contributions </H5>
  In FY93 &yen;50.162 billion are appropriated for 
facilitating 
the acceptance of scholarship contributions from private firms 
and other outside organizations; the contributions should be 
applied to expenditures for scientific research or expenses 
aimed at educational research in national universities. This 
funding is &yen;1.978 billion more than that of the year before. 
<H3>  6. Promotion of Test and Applied Research by Means of 
Subsidies for Scientific Research Expenses "Test Research" </H3>
  The purpose of this "test research" is to promote test and 
applied research for which there is the possibility of those 
research results being shifted into practical applications. The 
MOE praises test research that is based on the participation of 
researchers from the research departments of private firms, and 
appropriated &yen;6.560 billion as subsidies for that. This is 
an increase of &yen;860 million over the previous year. 
<H3>  7. Promotion of JSPS "Social Cooperation Scientific 
Enterprises" </H3>
  Based on the deliberations of the Science Council, the JSPS 
has launched general research liaison meetings since cooperative 
university-industry efforts first developed in 1982. The purpose 
of these meetings, which are made up of leaders and 
professionals involved in the research activities of industry 
and universities, is to comprehensively investigate, with a 
long-term outlook, the problems of university-industry 
cooperation. Now, special committees on "human genome" and 
"atomic cluster" R&amp;D have been organized from those meetings, 
and &yen;16 million are appropriated for the promotion of those 
enterprises in FY93. 
<H5>  G. Support for Private Scientific Research Organizations </H5>
  Private scientific research organizations have an important 
mission in promoting Japan's science, which is reflected in the 
"Law on Support of Private Scientific Research Organizations" 
(1951 No. 227). Based on that law, the MOE appropriated &yen;123 
million in FY93 to provide partial support for the expenses 
needed to maintain and operate the corporations whose purpose is 
scientific research that were established in accordance with the 
provisions of Article 34 of the Civil Code. In that, &yen;16 
million are appropriated as outlays needed for private 
scientific research organizations in the form of ODA enterprises 
to carry out scientific exchange and cooperation based on the 
requests of research organizations of developing countries. 
<H5>  H. Maintenance, Repletion of Scientific Information and Data </H5>
<H5>  1. Maintenance, Repletion of Scientific Information Systems </H5>
  Quickly and accurately providing the scientific information 
needed by university researchers, together with maintaining 
comprehensive nationwide scientific information systems for 
disseminating research results within and outside of Japan, is 
becoming an urgent necessity as the basis for bringing forth 
excellent, creative and pioneering scientific research. 
  To that end the MOE is now working to expand the 
organization 
and functions of the NACSIS, which was established in 1987, and 
is actively equipping a scientific information system that will 
link national and private universities throughout Japan to the 
center. 
  During FY93 the MOE will promote the maintenance of a 
comprehensive, nationwide fluid system for scientific 
information by introducing computers into university libraries; 
expanding large computer centers, general information processing 
centers, etc.; and facilitating the creation of databases. 
  (a) Maintenance of the NACSIS 
  The MOE will work to expand the organization and functions 
of 
NACSIS, which will be the central organ of the scientific 
information system. 
  In FY93 &yen;2.579 billion are appropriated as the outlays 
needed for implementing the following activities. 
  1) Coordinating the planning and linkage of the 
scientific information system 
  2) Comprehensive R&amp;D in connection with scientific 
information 
  3) Building and operating a scientific information network 
  4) Collecting and cataloging primary information and 
supplying information on the whereabouts of that information; 
Coping with the systematic collection of primary information 
from university libraries, etc. (scientific books, periodicals, 
etc.) by creating catalogs and databases containing information 
on the locations of those books, periodicals, etc., and a quick, 
accurate service to provide that information. Providing an 
electronic inter-library lending (ILL) system. 
  5) Providing an information retrieval service; A quick, 
accurate service to provide secondary information (numerical, 
image, and other such fact data; bibliographies; abstracts of 
documents; etc.) 
  6) Facilitating database creation 
  7) Education, training, etc. 
  (b) Maintenance, Repletion of Component Organizations in the 
Scientific Information System 
  For maintenance and repletion of the basic conditions for 
the 
scientific information system, the MOE took the measures 
described below in connection with the FY93 expenses for 
university libraries, database creation, and the information 
processing facilities that will make up the scientific 
information system. 



  1) Establishment, Maintenance of Large Computer Centers 
and Other Information Processing Facilities 
  The large computer centers that are nationwide joint-use 
facilities and the general information processing centers of 
joint educational research facilities within universities 
perform scientific and technical calculations and data 
processing for research, education, etc., in universities, and 
they use databases to provide scientific information services. 
  Already seven large computer centers, 15 general information 
processing centers, and 49 information processing centers have 
been set up. During FY93, the Tohoku University Computing 
Center's supercomputer will be updated, and new general 
information processing centers will be set up at the Yokohama 
National University and Ehime University; and new information 
processing centers will be established at the Joetsu University 
of Education and at the Kyoto University of Education. 
  2) Introduction, etc., of Special-Purpose Library 
Computers 
  Since 1980 the MOE has been promoting programs to introduce 
special-purpose computers into libraries on the premise that 
university libraries would be networked together. This program 
is an attempt to construct a scientific information system in 
which mid-sized special-purpose computers are placed in large 
libraries and small special-purpose computers are set up in 
small libraries. Computers have already been introduced at 13 
large libraries and 73 small libraries. During FY93, 
special-purpose computers will be introduced at seven small 
libraries (Otaru University of Commerce, Kitami Institute of 
Technology, Hiromae University, Iwate University, Saitama 
University, Tokyo University of Fisheries, and Kochi University). 
  3) Maintenance, Repletion of Foreign Magazine Centers 
(Accumulation, Provision of Primary Information) 
  From the viewpoint of common ownership of scientific 
information resources, since FY77 the MOE has designated certain 
university libraries as foreign magazine centers for four 
fields: medicine and biology (the libraries of Osaka, Tohoku, 
and Kyushu Universities), physics and engineering (the libraries 
of Tokyo Institute of Technology and Kyoto University), 
agriculture (the libraries of Tokyo and Kagoshima Universities), 
and humanities and social science (the libraries of Hitotsubashi 
and Kobe Universities). These centers share the work of 
systematically collecting materials, centering on foreign 
magazines that are scarce in Japan, and they provide information 
services to researchers throughout Japan that include document 
copy services. 
  By FY92 the foreign magazine centers had accumulated about 
19,000 titles of foreign scientific magazines in the four 
fields; over 500,000 copies per year are made. 
  Furthermore, in order to make research and educational 
materials more replete, &yen;2.4111 billion (FY92, &yen;2.32783 
billion) are appropriated in FY93 for purchasing books for 
students, special books, foreign magazines, and electronic 
information materials. Along with that, to facilitate the 
modernization of the libraries by means of mechanization, 
&yen;35.271 million are appropriated as expenses for book 
detection systems (equipment to prevent unauthorized borrowing 
of books), CD-ROM systems and audio-visual equipment systems; 
&yen;2.413202 billion (FY92, &yen;2.338834 billion) are 
appropriated as expenses needed for improving library services, 
e.g., basic operating expenses and keeping the library open at 
night. 
  4) Forming Databases 
  In order to disseminate university researchers' research 
results within and outside of Japan, it is very important to 
organize vast amounts of information and make it available for 
use by forming databases in which the information is accumulated 
on computer-processable magnetic media. 
  In FY93, &yen;466.5 million (mentioned twice) are 
appropriated as expenses for the creation or purchase of 
databases at NACSIS. In addition, &yen;121.0 million are 
appropriated as expenses for creating databases in universities, 
and &yen;35.30 million for purchasing the international 
databases that are needed for providing information retrieval 
services to researchers. 
  5) Maintenance of Campus Information Networks (LANs) 
  Since FY87 the MOE has been programmatically outfitting and 
maintaining campus information networks (campus LANs). This 
involves networking various kinds of computers together with 
optical fibers and other means so that numerical and graphical 
scientific information from laboratories can be utilized. 
  In FY93 &yen;99.83 million are appropriated for setting up a 
LAN at Kyushu University. 
  6) Maintenance, Repletion of Document Materials Centers 
  The MOE maintains document materials centers and data 
materials centers so that it can centrally maintain data and 
primary materials for special fields and offer it for joint use 
throughout Japan, and create databases in those fields. The MOE 
found ways to make the operations of the National Cultural 
Research Materials Hall, and the document materials centers more 
replete in FY93. 
<H5>  2. Maintenance, Repletion of Scientific Materials </H5>
  (a) Maintenance of Animal Experiment Facilities 
  To improve the accuracy of animal experiments and to 
facilitate more efficient breeding control, the MOE maintains 
modern animal experiment facilities. In FY93 the MOE will set up 
new animal experiment facilities at the University of the 
Ryukyus, and will equip the animal experiment facilities at 
Nagoya University and the Medical College of Oita. As for those 
expenses, &yen;224.199 million (FY92, &yen;224.199 million) are 
appropriated for purchasing animals and feed, and &yen;131.110 
million (FY92, &yen;92.536 million) for facilities and 
equipment. The MOE also increased the outlays needed for 
operating the facilities. 
  (b) Strain Preservation Enterprises 
  The MOE runs enterprises to preserve the strains of animals, 
plants, microorganisms, and other living organisms with 
characteristics that are useful in scientific research. In FY93 
the necessary expenses for preserving strains are appropriated. 
A total of 84 species are preserved at national universities: 30 
animal species, 27 plant species, 20 microorganism species, and 
seven varieties of cell stock. 
  (c) Maintenance of Scientific Specimens 
  Establishing a system for collecting, storing, and utilizing 
the materials used for education and research in various fields 
is essential in the promotion of scientific research. For that 
reason a specimen materials hall was set up in 1965 for storing 
and employing education and research materials for special 
fields. In FY93 the MOE appropriated the expenses needed to 
maintain those specimens at the Tokyo University General 
Research Materials Hall and at the textile museum affiliated 
with the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology 
Engineering Department. 
  (d) Maintenance of Isotope Research Facilities 
  Because of the need for special care in the handling of 
radioactive isotopes based on the "Law on Preventing Radiation 
Hazards due to Radioactive Isotopes," the MOE maintains isotope 
research facilities at which ample consideration is given to 
radiation safety management. In FY93, the MOE will establish the 
new Isotope Center at Niigata University, and will post 
management personnel at the Shizuoka University isotope research 
facilities. In addition to appropriating &yen;279.04 million 
(FY92, &yen;376.474 million) for facilities and equipment to 
prevent radiation hazards, the MOE also appropriated the funds 
needed for operating those facilities.

<H5>  I. Repletion, Strengthening of the JSPS </H5>
  The JSPS, whose purpose is to contribute to the advancement 
of science, carries out a wide variety of projects that relate 
to the promotion of science: supporting scientific research, 
assisting researchers, facilitating international cooperation in 
science, etc. 
  In FY93 &yen;8.98940 billion (in FY92, &yen;7.65736 
billion), 
which is an increase of 17&percnt; over the previous year, are 
appropriated for the following efforts. 
  1) Broadly expanding the number of special researchers 
employed and improving research incentive funds to help foster 
excellent young researchers in accordance with the Science 
Council's report entitled "Measures for Comprehensively 
Promoting Scientific Research with Prospects for the 21st 
Century" (July 1992). 
  2) Repletion of the "Overseas Special Researcher System," 
which sends prominent young researchers to scientific research 
organizations overseas for long-term stays for the purposes of 
nurturing and securing competent researchers with an 
international point of view to support the future of Japan's 
science. 
  3) Repletion of the "Foreigner Special Researcher 
System," the purposes of which are to have Japanese universities 
accept young post-doctorate researchers from other countries and 
employ them in research under the appropriate leaders, to 
contribute to the cultivation of researchers in foreign 
countries, to apply an academic stimulus to the young 
researchers of Japan, and to contribute to the advance of 
scientific research. 
  4) Repletion of commissioned Japanese-language training 
enterprises for foreign researchers so that foreign researchers 
who stay long-term at Japanese universities can carry out their 
research activities adequately. 
  5) Starting Japanese-German scientific cooperation 
efforts by promoting front-line research and creative concepts 
between Japan and Germany. 
  6) Expansion of support for people who want to get 
doctorate degrees, which is a policy for promoting scientific 
exchange with ASEAN countries, and holding the Asia Science 
Seminars again, which help to nurture researchers and improve 
the level of research in Asia. 
<H5>  J. Promotion of Global Environmental Research </H5>
  Today there are serious concerns about global-scale 
environmental problems such as global warming, ozone layer 
depletion, and acid rain. Finding solutions to those problems is 
an urgent and important issue for the future survival and 
prosperity of humankind. 
  In order to solve these global environmental problems, the 
further accumulation of scientific knowledge about the 
mechanisms that give rise to global-scale environmental changes 
in the atmosphere, oceans, and ecosystems is extremely important. 
  There are also strong calls for tackling these problems in 
an 
internationally cooperative manner. 
  With that kind of awareness, the MOE is actively endeavoring 
towards finding solutions to global environmental problems 
through maintenance and repletion of research systems in 
universities and through the promotion of joint international 
research efforts. (Table 5)

committee members and survey members and personnel from 
concerned ministries and agencies (set up in July 1976) is the 
organization for dealing with the intergovernmental joint survey 
projects that UNESCO implements in connection with global 
environmental science (Intergovernmental Oceanography Committee 
(IOC), Man and Biosphere project (MAB), International Hydrology 
Project (IHP), and the General Information Project (GIP)). This 
subcommittee plans research studies, provides data, sends 
representatives to intergovernmental conferences, and so forth. 
In FY93 &yen;4.441 million are appropriated for those expenses. 
  In addition, the MOE has been contributing trust funds to 
UNESCO since FY81 in order to take part in the "Western Pacific 
Joint Survey" (WESTPAC), which is implemented as a part of the 
IOC enterprise. Continued again in FY93, the funds equivalent to 
$30,000 are appropriated. 
  Furthermore, funds equivalent to $80,000 are appropriated 
again in FY93 as trust funds for UNESCO IHP students. These 
donations started in FY92. 
  Incidentally, in FY93, trust funds equivalent to $50,000 are

<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  An important key to the health and affluence of the 
long-lived society of the 21st century is to make the best use 
of the fruits of science and technology in improving the health 
and welfare of the people. In such anage, making the most of 
S&amp;T 
results relating to improving the quality of people's lifestyles 
while at the same time striving for harmony between science and 
humankind is essential. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) 
grasps the concept of "health science" from such a point of view 
and strives to promote the fields of S&amp;T that can answer the 
needs of health care, welfare, hygiene, etc. 
  Although Japan's economic development has led to dramatic 
improvements in the people's way of life, it has also led to 
more complicated and diversified needs with respect to the 
S&amp;T 
fields over which the MHW has charge, i.e., health care, 
welfare, hygiene, etc. On the other hand, the remarkable S&amp;T 
developments centering on biotechnology and other such 
leading-edge technology fields point to many possibilities for 
improving people's lifestyles. In order to quickly and 
appropriately cope with the changes resulting from both these 
needs and seeds, a conventional centralized administration alone 
is inadequate in the fight against cancer, cardiovascular 
diseases, and incurable diseases. It is becoming essential for 
the MHW to implement its S&amp;T administration in a unitary and 
across-the-board fashion. 
  In order to cope with such a state of affairs, the MHW set 
up 
the Health Science Division, which handles the overall 
coordination and efficient execution of the MHW's S&amp;T 
measures. 
The FY93 budget needed to promote these S&amp;T measures is 
&yen;64.343 billion, which is an increase of &yen;3.005 billion 
(4.9&percnt;) over the FY92 budget. 
<H5>  B. Health Science Conferences </H5>
  In promoting "health science," a basic strategy must be 
established and studies must be conducted on setting 
future-oriented priority research topics that are based on that 
strategy. Then, because there are also fields of health science 
that involve bioethics, safety, and other such delicate 
problems, the Health Science Conferences were set up in November 
1986 as round-table discussions with the Minister of Health and 
Welfare. At the conferences, the expert opinions of 
knowledgeable and experienced people are solicited, and it is 
appropriate to aim for a public-consensus type of format. 
  Since the first meeting in November 1986, discussions have 
been held at the Health Science Conferences on issues such as 
the basic mid- and long-term strategies for promoting health 
science, priority research topics that will continue into the 
future, how health science research should be evaluated, and so 
forth. In September 1988 a report entitled "For the 
Establishment of a Basis and Breakthroughs in Health Science 
Research" was compiled. 
  As the mid- and long-term strategies for strengthening the 
system of health science research, this report cites the 
following as necessary in order to establish a foundation: 1) 
revamping the research system; 2) increasing the budget for 
research expenses and making effective use of the strength of 
the private sector; 3) cultivating, securing, and employing 
excellent researchers; and 4) strengthening the research support 
system. For breakthroughs, the report stresses the importance 
of: 1) setting priority themes and implementing research based 
on project formats; 2) facilitating research exchange among 
industry, government, and universities; and 3) facilitating 
research exchange with overseas organizations. 
  The priority research fields at the time were: 


    -  cancer 
  -  aging, geriatric diseases (cardiovascular 
disorders, metabolic disorders) 
  -  mental and neurological 
disorders (including Alzheimer's disease and other such dementia 
diseases) 
  -  infectious diseases (AIDS, hepatitis, ATL, etc.) 
  -  maternity, childhood diseases (perinatal diseases, etc.) 
  -  organ 
technology (artificial organ transplants) 
  -  genetic treatment 
(including human gene sequence research) 
  -  drug-making technology 
(drug design, drug delivery systems, etc.) 
  -  safety evaluation 
science (regulatory science, risk management, etc.) 
  -  lifestyle 
support technology (rehabilitation science, welfare, lifestyle 
machinery, etc.) 
  -  health care technology evaluation methods 
(scientific research and evaluation of effectiveness, safety, 
efficiency, etc., of medical technology, etc.) 

    Periodic revisions, generally about every five years, are 
seen as necessary. In addition, in August 1989 the report 
entitled "How Research Evaluations Should Basically Be," and in 
October 1991, "The Promotion of Human Genome Research in the 
Ministry of Health and Welfare" were compiled. Then, in July 
1992 "The Promotion of Nursing Equipment R&amp;D" and in April 
1993 
"Guidelines on Genetic Treatment Clinical Research" were 
compiled. 
<H5>  C. Promotion of Test Research </H5>
  While dealing with the trends in S&amp;T development 
described 
above, the MHW endeavors to promote test research, centering on 
priority research fields, by mustering the technology of its 
affiliated research institutes, universities, regional hygiene 
institutes, private-sector test research institutes, etc. 
  The MHW's S&amp;T budget is given in Table 1. Due to the 
situation today where the fields that the MHW handles are 
increasingly important, there has been a succession of new 
research projects in recent years. Projects are arranged in 
units of disease, i.e., cancer, cardiovascular disorders, mental 
and neurological disorders, diabetes, kidney failure, 
rheumatism, dementia, non-A-or-B-type hepatitis, and AIDS. 
Across-the-board projects are also emerging that are the kind of 
basic human science research aimed at gerontology research and 
joint government-private research for coping with an aged 
society. 
  In the FY93 budget, there are additional new appropriations 
of &yen;150 million for advanced medical research to implement 
studies geared toward the practical application of genetic 
treatment; &yen;50 million for general research on nursing 
measures; and, from the viewpoint of new global environmental 
and health problems, the research outlays for promoting more 
advanced water service and waste treatment technology were 
rearranged and &yen;360 million are appropriated for promoting 
global and health research projects aimed at the long-term 
maintenance of humankind's health in correspondence with 
environmental changes. In addition, as a major part of the "Stop 
AIDS" strategy, &yen;1.731 billion are appropriated in the FY93 
budget (an increase of &yen;502 million, or 41&percnt; over the 
previous year) for research on AIDS countermeasures, which 
involves research on the prevention of AIDS outbreaks, methods 
of treating AIDS, the development of AIDS drugs, etc.

<H5>  1. Health Science Research Expenses </H5>
  The objectives of health science research are to find 
solutions to the problems of maintaining and promoting the 
people's health and improving health care; to make those results 
reflect in policies; and to contribute to the promotion, 
development of health and welfare administration. Summaries of 
the main research expenses are given below. 
  (1) Expenses for General Research in Longevity Science 
  Longevity science is general science that studies overall 
societies and economies that can happily and robustly maintain 
long life. It is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary field of 
research on elderly people and an aged society. It involves 
elucidating the physiological mechanisms of aging and 
preventing, diagnosing, treating, and elucidating the causes of 
diseases specific to elderly people. This field also encompasses 
research on the social and psychological problems of elderly 
people. 
  Now, as society grows older, the development of technology 
and systems for elderly people to live healthy lives and for 
them to continue to adapt to an independent social lifestyle is 
becoming essential. Then, in order to mobilize related sciences 
to ensure the mental and physical health of elderly people and 
improve the quality of their lives, research in what was dubbed 
"Silver Science" started in FY87 for the purpose of promoting 
the R&amp;D of S&amp;T for coping with an aged society. The name 
of that 
research was changed to general longevity science in FY90, and 
the MHW aims to make it more replete. 
  In the FY92 budget &yen;1.785 billion are appropriated for 
this research, which is an increase of &yen;131 million 
(7.9&percnt;) 
over that of the FY92 budget. 
  (2) Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy 
  In 1981 cancer replaced strokes as the leading cause of 
death 
in Japan, and, with the increase in cancer since then, 
controlling cancer is the earnest wish of the people. 
  Given such a situation, the government cited cancer control 
as one of the most serious issues in government administration. 
The "Cabinet Meeting on Cancer Countermeasures" under the 
leadership of the Prime Minister, and under that the "Meeting of 
Experts on Cancer Countermeasures" made up of 10 experts, were 
set up. Then on 7 June 1983 the "Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy" 
was devised. 
  The aim of the "Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy" is to 
elucidate the true nature of cancer within 10 years. The program 
promotes advanced cancer research, such as research on 
oncogenes, by mobilizing intelligence from within and outside; 
it is an attempt to make those results reflect on the 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer, and should be of 
use to people suffering from cancer. To that end, various 
efforts will be made as basic policies for achieving the 
following five goals: 
  1) setting priority research topics, 
  2) promoting concentrated, diversified research, 
  3) finding ways to nurture and employ young researchers, 
  4) promoting international cooperation centering on Japan 
and 
the U.S., and 
  5) maintaining support systems such as systems for supplying 
experimental materials. 
  That which forms the core of the strategy is the promotion 
of 
priority, intensive, diversified research aimed at elucidating 
the essence of cancer. 
  The research fields that will be tackled along the lines of 
the Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy are the following six fields: 
  1) research on human cancer genes, 
  2) research on human carcinogenesis due to viruses,, 
  3) research on carcinogenic acceleration and suppression of 
that, 
  4) research in connection with the development of new 
technology for the early diagnosis of cancer, 
  5) research in connection with the development of treatment 
methods based on new theories, and 
  6) research on mechanisms of immunological suppression and 
control substances. 
  Project teams are formed for each of the research fields 
promoted. 
  These strategic efforts are being tackled by the government, 
universities, and the private sector. Within the government, the 
MHW, MOE, and STA collaborate in research on cancer. &yen;1.847 
billion are appropriated in the MHW's FY93 budget. 
  This fiscal year is the last year of the Ten-Year 
Anti-Cancer 
Strategy. Now, the MOE is taking a hard look at the results of 
the research thus far and the future prospects, and studies are 
being made on the Post-Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy. 
  (3) Basic Human Science Research 
  Research at the MHW had been carried out within a vertical 
system in the form of measures against individual diseases such 
as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, incurable diseases, etc. 
But, amidst the remarkable developments in S&amp;T, there is a 
need 
for the development of basic technologies in the broad areas of 
health care, medicine, and welfare. To that end, the MHW is to 
facilitate joint government-private research in basic science 
while continuing to actively make the best use of private-sector 
energy. Since FY88 it has been promoting that research under the 
name Basic Human Science Research, which had been called 
Longevity-Related Basic Scientific Research since FY86. 
  The contents of that research are: 1) biotechnology 
applications and the development of evaluation technology, which 
form the basis of the life sciences; 2) the establishment of 
sugar-chain engineering as a new technology and the application 
of that in the fields of medicine and medical treatment; 3) 
research on technology for evaluating, improving, and developing 
the medical materials that form the basis for medical and 
welfare services; 4) elucidating the biodefense mechanisms that 
form the basis of health maintenance. 
  (4) Expenses for New Medical Technology R&amp;D 
  These consist of three research outlays: New Medical 
Technology Developmental Research Expenses, Organ Technology 
Clinical R&amp;D Expenses, and Emergency and Disaster Medical 
Treatment General Scientific Research Expenses. The New Medical 
Technology Developmental Research Expenses promoted the "New 
Medical Technology Research Expenses" that was instituted in 
FY64 in the form of joint industry-government-university project 
research since FY90. In FY93, research on the development of 
more efficient medical equipment was added, and &yen;226 million 
was appropriated. 
  The Organ Technology Clinical R&amp;D Expenses, which were 
instituted in FY90, promote clinical research for establishing 
organ transplant technology and for safely and effectively 
carrying out organ transplants. This fiscal year, research on a 
network system for organ transplants within Japan, research in 
connection with the dissemination of information about organ 
transplants, and research on organ transplant coordinator 
technology were added. &yen;100 million were appropriated for 
these expenses. Emergency and Disaster Medical Treatment General 
Scientific Research Expenses were instituted in FY91 for 
studying medical treatment in natural disasters and in urban 
group disasters. In FY93 &yen;100 million are appropriated.

<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  As Japan's economy and society evolve and change, 
agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and farming and fishing 
villages face issues such as demonstrating highly productive 
capabilities that can accurately answer diverse consumer needs; 
securing local workers in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; 
regional activation; and the formation of attractive regional 
societies. 
  On the other hand, the management of Japan's overall 
finances 
involves dealing with even more thorough expenditure estimates. 
  Given such a situation, the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry 
and Fisheries (MAFF) re-examined its system and policies along 
the lines of "Trends in Government Policies on New Foodstuffs, 
Agriculture, and Farming Villages," which pointed out the trends 
in policy developments geared toward the new age of the 21st 
century, and formulated its FY93 budget from the viewpoint of 
steadily implementing new policies in stages. General account 
expenditures in FY93 for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries 
amount to &yen;3.3855 trillion, including the agriculture, 
forestry, and fishery budgets of the Prime Minister's Office and 
the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Health and 
Welfare. 
  In that the Expenses for Promotion of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fishery S&amp;T are &yen;73.0 billion, which is an increase 
of 
3.9&percnt; over that of FY92. 
  The following describes the MAFF budget in terms of the main 
policies. 
<H3>  B. Implementation of R&amp;D To Cope with Important Policy 
Issues </H3>
  In order to cope with important policy issues relating to 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries, the MAFF will implement 
research that deals with improvements in agricultural 
productivity, diversification and sophistication of consumer 
needs, and global environmental and tropical agriculture 
problems. 
<H5>  1. R&amp;D for Improvements in Agricultural Productivity </H5>
  The MAFF will implement new types of regional research 
involving "technology development for rationalizing regionally 
managed agriculture." This research will entail the 
comprehensive and systematic development of technology to cope 
with the problems directly facing the regions. The objective is 
to make practical the innovative technology needed for 
large-scale, high-productivity agriculture. 
  The MAFF will also conduct surveys for building a research 
strategy aimed at the development of future agricultural 
machinery and the establishment of agricultural technology 
adapted to that.

obtained thus far and comprehensively and systematically carry 
out new technology development to make practical the innovative 
technology needed for establishing large-scale, 
high-productivity agriculture. This work will be shared by 
national regional agricultural test stations and prefectural 
agricultural test stations, and with the cooperation of the 
government, will take place in regional agricultural areas as 
well as in the test stations.

<H3>  3. Development of Methods for Planning Agricultural Village 
Activation by Utilizing Regional Resources </H3>
  (1) Summary 
  Depopulation and the percentage of elderly people are 
increasing in the regions between mountains because of the poor 
living and crop production conditions. In these regions more and 
more farms are being abandoned, and there is concern about the 
collapse of the farming-village society. In order to activate 
such regions, the regional resources of the villages must be 
utilized to the fullest extent. To that end, this effort will 
help clarify the special nature of regional resource utilization 
processes and improve the methods of quantifying the economic 
value of those resources. Furthermore, based on international 
comparisons with regional activation in advanced countries, the 
MAFF will formulate methods to plan the appropriate utilization 
of regional resources and management subjects, develop limited 
expense burden management methods, and contribute to formulating 
farming-village activation plans in cities, towns, and villages. 
  (2) Contents of the Research 
  1) Clarify the special nature of regional resource 
utilization processes and improve the methods of quantifying the 
economic value of those resources 
  2) Investigate the applicability in Japan of advanced 
countries' regional resource utilization methods and management 
plans 
  3) Develop appropriate regional resource utilization 
plans and management methods 
<H3>  4. Elucidation of Crop Hardening Mechanisms in Severely Cold 
Environments </H3>
  (1) Summary 
  In the main crops of cold regions (pasture grasses, grains), 
damage due to winter freezes and heavy snows becomes the 
greatest hindrance to expanding planting and stable production, 
and the development of techniques for improving those crops' 
capacity for surviving the winter is desired. By elucidating at 
the substance level the mechanisms by which plants acquire the 
resistance to make it through the winter (hardening), this 
effort will contribute to the development of techniques that 
will be the basis for promoting agriculture in very cold 
regions, e.g., techniques for improving crops' ability to 
withstand freezing, the cultivation of varieties with a higher 
ability to withstand freezing, and the introduction of new crops. 
  (2) Contents of the Research 
  1) Elucidating hardening inducement mechanisms 
  2) Elucidating the process by which hardening is achieved 
and the mechanisms by which plants acquire resistance against 
freezing and snow accumulation 
<H3>  5. Elucidating the Causes of and Predicting Future 
Fluctuations in Vegetable Supply and Demand </H3>
  (1) Summary 
  In recent years the prices of vegetables have fluctuated 
wildly because of the compound effects of the weakening of the 
production base due to labor shortages and the aging of the 
farming community, direct sales of produce from the producing 
areas and other changes in the distribution structure, and 
weather disasters. This effort is to clarify the ways that 
producing areas should cope with the situation, based on 
consumer needs, the changes in distribution and market 
structures, and the planting trends in producing areas with 
labor shortages. Furthermore, the MAFF will clarify the causes 
of fluctuations in demand, including climate fluctuations; 
develop models to predict fluctuations in the demand for main 
vegetables; and contribute toward proposing new government 
policies for stable supply and demand. 
  (2) Contents of the Research 
  1) Clarifying the changes in vegetable production and 
distribution structures, and how producing regions should cope 
with those changes 
  2) Development of methods for predicting fluctuations in

<H3>  6. Research on Hybrid Wood Materials to Improve Housing 
Characteristics </H3>
  (1) Summary 
  Construction of three-storied wooden multiple dwellings was 
allowed for the first time in FY93. Nevertheless, because wooden 
multiple dwellings have problems, such as a lack of 
soundproofness, this research will involve developing hybrid 
materials in which concrete, rubber, plastic, etc., are 
incorporated into wood for the purposes of soundproofness 
similar to that of concrete, heat storing characteristics for 
energy conservation, and safety in housing geared toward elderly 
people. Furthermore, the MAFF will formulate structural systems 
and design guidelines for using those materials and will 
establish the basic technology for next-generation 
wooden-construction housing. 
  (2) Contents of the Research 
  1) Development of basic technology for hybridized 
soundproof wooden materials 
  2) Development of hybridized heat-storing materials and 
technology for improving housing safety

insects that may become new pests because of the broadening of 
those areas. 
<H5>  9. R&amp;D Related to the Utilization of Insect Functions </H5>
  (1) Summary 
  In order to establish a new field of technology for 
utilizing 
as a resource insects that have useful functions and 
characteristics, government research organizations will develop 
basic technologies for elucidating and utilizing insect

<H3>  11. Development of Technology for Preventing the Spread of 
Harmful Naturalized Plants </H3>
  (1) Summary 
  Because over 50 exotic plant species have invaded and 
expanded over Japan's farm land, turned into weeds, and pose 
trouble for the farming and livestock industry, this effort 
involves elucidating the mechanisms by which those harmful 
plants invade, take root, and disperse; and developing 
cultivation and herbicidal techniques for controlling the plants 
that overtake farm land and turn into weeds. The MAFF will also 
consolidate the results, identify the species of weeds, and

<H5>  A. Structural Strengthening of the R&amp;D System </H5>
<H5>  1. Radical Expansion of MITI R&amp;D Budget </H5>
  (1) The Need for Expansion 
  In April 1992 the Cabinet decided on a new "S&amp;T Policy 
Outline," an important measure in which is the early doubling of 
government S&amp;T investments for the objectives of humankind's 
harmonious coexistence with the earth, expansion of intellectual 
stock, and building a caring society that lives with peace of 
mind. Then in June 1992 the Cabinet decided on the "New Economic 
Plan," which calls for the government to make S&amp;T promotion 
measures one of the pillars of policy administration. Those 
measures include accelerating public fundamental R&amp;D, 
centering 
on basic R&amp;D; an early doubling of government S&amp;T 
investments; 
and helping to make private-sector R&amp;D investments replete. 
  (2) Summary of FY93 Budget 
  For the FY93 R&amp;D budget (including special accounts), 
&yen;282.0 billion are appropriated in all, which is an increase 
of &yen;22.8 billion or 8.8&percnt; over the previous year. The 
S&amp;T 
promotion budget, which centers around general account research 
expenditures, is &yen;58.9 billion for FY93. That is an increase 
of 4.8&percnt; over the previous year, which is significantly 
higher 
than the largest increase during the past 10 years (3.1&percnt; 
in 
FY81). 
<H5>  2. Formulating Guidelines on Industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D, etc. </H5>
  (1) Formulation of Guidelines on Industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D 
  It was pointed out that R&amp;D should be promoted along the 
lines of the report of the Industrial Technology Council's 
planning committee (June 1992). The report lays down guidelines 
on industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D, then comprehensively and 
concretely 
presents the directions in which MITI-driven R&amp;D should 
proceed. 
  For that reason the "R&amp;D Guidelines Committee" (chaired 
by 
Hiroshi Inose, head of the National Center for Science 
Information Systems (NACSIS)) was set up in the general meeting 
of the Industrial Technology Council, and in January 1993 
tentative guidelines on industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D were drafted. 
  Those guidelines set forth a basic policy, under the concept 
of technoglobalism, to promote S&amp;T in three directions: 
basic, 
creative R&amp;D; R&amp;D based on a global, international 
viewpoint; 
and R&amp;D aimed at improving the Japanese people's lifestyle. 
  While MITI will endeavor in R&amp;D based on that draft of 
the 
guidelines, it will broadly seek out viewpoints from all 
perspectives and will work to quickly gain a definite plan. 
  (Components of the tentative guidelines) 
  a) Objectives of the guidelines 
  b) Perception of current state of affairs surrounding 
industrial S&amp;T 
  c) Basic policies on future industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D 
  d) How MITI's R&amp;D should proceed 
  e) R&amp;D directions and topics, by field

  (2) History and Creative Application of Industrial 
Technology 
  &yen;36 million 
  The history of Japan's industrial technology is not only 
significant in that it makes up an important area in history. It 
also tells of the dreams, passions, and efforts that pioneers 
have challenged, and it fosters an environment in which young 
people want to take up the fruitful challenge of creating 
something. 
  Nevertheless, the relics, materials, and living witnesses of 
the history of industrial technology are rapidly disappearing, 
and if activities relating to the history of industrial 
technology are left as they are now, i.e., localized and 
sporadic, it will be very difficult to pass on the history of 
industrial technology to the next generation. 
  Therefore, there is a need for expeditious maintenance of a 
system for passing on the history of industrial technology and 
applying it in the promotion of creative and effective R&amp;D 
and 
the cultivation of excellent researchers. During FY93 MITI will 
promote surveys of materials pertaining to the history of 
industrial technology. 
<H3>  3. Formulation of a Five-Year Plan for Maintenance of MITI 
Research Facilities </H3>
  (1) Already 14 years have passed since the 1979 transfer of 
the Tsukuba research institutes, and the research facilities and 
equipment that were the newest at that time are now 
deteriorating and becoming obsolete. In addition, many of the 
regional test research institutes were built before 1975 and are 
showing marked deterioration. 
  The maintenance of these facilities and equipment forms the 
foundation for R&amp;D activities; and, the level of research in 
the 
future, systems of international cooperation, etc., are 
important issues relating to the roots of research. Therefore, 
facilities maintenance plans must be formulated from a mid-range 
viewpoint, and MITI's test research institutes must be 
systematically equipped and maintained. 
  (2) From that sort of perspective, studies on how mid-range 
maintenance, e.g., 
  a) better facilities and equipment that correlate with 
the state of progress in R&amp;D, 
  b) renovating facilities and equipment based on their 
actual state of deterioration, 
  c) maintaining facilities for promoting and aiding 
international research exchange, and 
  d) maintaining the facilities of regional test research 
institutes, 
  are being made by the Facilities Maintenance Studies 
Committee (chaired by Hisao Oka, director of NEDO) that was 
newly established in the general meeting of the Industrial 
Technology Council. 
  (3) Incidentally, regarding the entire government's research 
facilities maintenance, the government's "Five-Year Plan for 
Maintenance of Research Facilities" is now being drawn up by 
concerned ministries and agencies. 
<H5>  B. Expanding Basic, Creative Research, etc. </H5>
<H3>  1. Establishment of the Industrial S&amp;T Frontier Program 
(ISTF) </H3>
  &yen;25.267 (23.563) billion 
  To promote R&amp;D in basic and innovative areas that will 
contribute to the progress of future societies, the current 
National R&amp;D Programs (large-scale, system-oriented projects) 
and the R&amp;D Program of Basic Technologies for Future 
Industries 
(element- and materials-oriented next-generation projects) are 
not enough. In addition, dealing with the international 
situation that is accompanied by a shift into basic research is 
also difficult with those programs. Another important issue is 
the development of technology to realize a more comfortable way 
of life and to cope with more sophisticated lifestyles. 
  For that reason MITI will integrate the current large-scale 
projects, next-generation projects, etc., and will largely 
distinguish the R&amp;D efforts as follows. 
  (1) Basic and innovative R&amp;D in a serial stream, ranging 
from uncovering seeds to fomenting projects and evaluation, that 
deals with international demands and is aimed at the 
construction of new technology systems and the realization of 
dramatic breakthroughs in technology. 
  (2) R&amp;D for the well-being of communities and societies 
that embraces issues that need to be dealt with from the 
viewpoint of the well-being of communities and societies, e.g., 
resource problems with which the private sector cannot cope 
subjectively and positively, and problems in the differences 
between the north and south. 
  MITI will also conduct leading research that will involve 
preparatory, basic research before the projects begin so that it 
can promote the projects in an efficient, systematic manner. 
  (Budget) 
  -- Leading research 
  &yen;246 (0) million 
  The FY93 research themes are: 
  1) High-order structurally controlled fused inorganic 
materials 
  2) Autonomous response materials 
  3) Technology for utilizing the functions of tropical 
organisms 
  4) Femto-second technology 
  5) Eco factories 
<H3>  2. Comprehensive Energy/Environmental Technology Development 
Promotion Projects (New Sunshine Project) </H3>
  &yen;53.901 (50.255) billion 
  Sustaining continued growth while overcoming environmental 
and energy constraints is an urgent issue for the world. To 
achieve that technological breakthroughs are essential, and the 
development of energy/environmental technology must be promoted 
comprehensively and in an accelerated manner. 
  From such a viewpoint, MITI consolidated the AIST R&amp;D 
programs for new energy technology (Sunshine Project), 
energy-conservation technology (Moonlight Project), and global 
environmental technology, and formulated the New Sunshine 
Project (energy/environmental technology development promotion 
projects) to promote the development of revolutionary 
energy/environmental technology. 
  In the New Sunshine Project, MITI will 1) gradiently 
accelerate and promote internationally open projects involving 
the development of revolutionary energy/environmental 
technology, the aim of which is the realization of the "Action 
Plan for Prevention of Global Warming"; actively promote 2) 
large-scale international joint research programs, the aim of 
which is to promote the "Global Renewal Plan"; and 3) joint 
research programs on appropriate technologies, the aim of which 
is to help alleviate the energy/environmental constraints in 
nearby developing countries. 
  Concretely, under this project MITI will begin new joint 
international technology development efforts to develop a

  As global warming countermeasures, MITI will promote the 
development of technology for improving thermal efficiency that 
will contribute to the reduction of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions 
when coal is burned, and clean coal technology such as slurrying 
cartridge technology to eliminate restrictions in coal handling. 
  (4) Promotion of Global Environmental Industrial Technology 
  &yen;10.228 (7.993) billion 
  Both economic development and environmental conservation are 
important in finding solutions to global environmental problems. 
Therefore, working together in international harmony toward 
technological breakthroughs is essential. From such a viewpoint, 
MITI will promote 1) the transfer of environmental and energy 
technology to developing countries, and 2) the concretization of 
the "Global Renewal Plan," one prong of which is the development 
of environmental and energy technology. 
  As for the development of innovative technologies within 
this 
effort, during FY93 MITI will promote the development of 
technology for CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  fixation and effective 
utilization, with NEDO and RITE at the center of that 
development, and will actively effectivate the expansion of 
scientific knowledge and international joint research efforts 
relating to the development of such technologies. 
  (5) Development of Systems for Using Data From Global 
Environmental Observation Satellites 
  &yen;1.108 (1.402) billion

<H3>  2. Augmenting the Development of Technology for Realizing a 
Comfortable Way of Life </H3>
  (1) Promotion of the 21st Century Housing Development 
Project 
  &yen;1.844 (1.723) billion 
  MITI will promote this seven-year project (the new housing 
mass-production technology and systems development project) that 
started in FY89. The objective of the project is to mass-produce 
reasonably priced housing that appropriately accommodates 
housing issues such as the shortage of tradesmen and the 
increase in household energy consumption, and answers the 
sophisticated and individualistic needs of homeowners and the 
characteristics of different regions. During FY93 MITI will 
promote the R&amp;D of a total system using the component 
subsystems 
developed up until FY92. 
  (2) Promotion of R&amp;D of Equipment and Technology for 
Medical 
Treatment and for the Elderly and Disabled 
  &yen;1,044 (687) million 
  In order to radically accelerate the R&amp;D of equipment 
that 
applies advanced technologies for the elderly and disabled and 
to accelerate the spread of factories that produce such 
equipment, MITI in cooperation with concerned ministries and 
agencies will look into establishing the "Law to Facilitate 
R&amp;D 
and Distribution of Implements for the Elderly and Disabled" 
(tentative name). Then MITI will proceed with systematic R&amp;D 
that ranges from research studies on concrete realization of the 
technology to assistance in developing practical-use technology. 
  (3) Promotion of the Mellow Society Concept 
  &yen;230 (204) million 
  MITI will strive to expand the mellow society concept, which 
supports elderly people's active participation in society 
through the use of information systems. Concretely, this effort 
involves the development of interfaces that elderly people will 
find easy to use, the construction of a system to centrally 
manage year-to-year health and medical information on 
individuals, and the establishment of a model mellow society. 
  (4) Promotion of Safety Base Maintenance 
  &yen;10 (0) million 
  In order to contribute to better consumer protection, e.g., 
the prevention of accidents involving commercial product and 
quick aid in fixing damages, starting in FY93 the International 
Trade and Industry Inspection Institute will be central in 
promoting the development of technology for investigating the 
causes of product accidents. The technology that is needed for 
elucidating the cause-and-effect relationship in those accidents 
will be based on information about the occurrences of accidents 
in recent years, analyses of causes, etc. 
<H5>  3. Promotion of Information-Related Technology Development </H5>
  (1) Promotion of New Information Processing Technology 
Development (Fourth-Generation Computers) 
  &yen;3,605 (884) million 
  MITI will promote the R&amp;D of basic technologies for the 
purpose of establishing innovative technologies for processing 
modern society's large volumes of information, which may be 
incomplete or incorrect, in batches and within realistic time 
spans (real-world computing). In implementing that R&amp;D, MITI 
will maintain a system of international cooperation, i.e., 
pioneering joint research with the national laboratories, 
universities, and firms of Japan as well as with GMD of Germany, 
European and Asian research organizations, and joint research on 
optical technology with the U.S. that is based on the Japan-U.S. 
S&amp;T Cooperation Agreement. The R&amp;D will be carried out 
through 
this program's international network. 
  (2) Creating the Foundation for Fifth-Generation Computer 
Technology Research 
  &yen;1.388 (3.592) billion 
  In the 11-year Fifth-Generation Computer Project, MITI 
researched and developed the technology for a full-scale 
parallel inference system. Now, with the results of this 
research, MITI will proceed with efforts to build the foundation 
for fifth-generation computer technology research: porting the 
software to UNIX machines, which are widely used; and developing 
application technology. 
<H5>  4. Promotion of Small-Business Technology Development </H5>
  (1) Development of Technology for Overcoming Labor Shortages 
in Small Firms 
  &yen;1.311 (1.373) billion 
  In correspondence with the technology development needs of 
the nation, prefectures, and small businesses, MITI will promote 
the development of automation and labor-saving technology and 
technology that will contribute toward making the improvements 
in workplace environments that are needed for small firms to 
secure labor. 
  (2) Promoting Small Businesses' Coping With the Energy 
Environment 
  &yen;240 (0) million 
  In order to facilitate small businesses' coping with the 
energy environment, MITI will support the development of 
technology for dealing with the energy environment by small 
business associations and other such groups that receive 
authorization for their projects based on the "Temporary Measure 
to Facilitate Business Activities Relating to the 
Rationalization of Energy Usage and the Use of Recycled 
Resources" (tentative name). 
<H5>  5. Promotion of Important Regional Technology Development </H5>
  &yen;1,058 (368) million 
  The national laboratories, public research organizations, 
and 
private firms in the regions are collaborating in R&amp;D 
involving 
themes that are closely linked with the needs of regional 
societies and economies, and themes that make full use of 
regional R&amp;D potential and resources. In advanced R&amp;D 
themes, 
NEDO will aid in the R&amp;D efforts of private firms.

  MITI will faithfully promote the B777 (the next large-scale 
commercial transport) development project, the V2500 (a jet 
engine for commercial aircraft) development project, and the YXX 
(the next-generation mid-scale commercial transport) development 
project. In addition, MITI will work to further promote the 
R&amp;D 
of a supersonic transport propulsion system under a large-scale 
project system and with consideration given to facilitating 
international research cooperation. 
  (5) Development of Unmanned Space Experimental System, etc. 
  &yen;12.622 (14.084) billion 
  MITI will promote the development, under international 
cooperation, of an experimental system that will be used in 
microgravity environments in space (Free Flyer and 
independent-return-type recovery capsules); and, for 
international global observation programs, the development of a 
futuristic resource-probing sensor (ASTER) that will be mounted 
on U.S. (NASA) satellites. 
<H5>  3. Facilitating Technology Transfer </H5>
  (1) Expanding International Energy/Environmental Cooperation 
(Green Aid Plan) 
  &yen;12.894 (2.671) billion 
  Under the Green Aid Plan, MITI will make the best possible 
use of Japan's advanced technology and experience to solve 
global-scale energy and environmental problems and promote 
cooperation in training, research, surveys, energy conservation 
and new energies, desulfurization technology demonstration 
surveys, etc., for the purpose of transferring and spreading 
energy and environmental technology to developing countries. 
  (2) Research Cooperation Efforts 
  &yen;2.800 (2.613) billion 
  (In which &yen;779 (463) million are for 
energy/environmental 
research cooperation) 
  In the developing countries of Asia where the growth of 
industrialization is astounding, energy and environmental 
problems are becoming serious. In connection with those and 
other technology development issues that are difficult to solve 
given the R&amp;D capabilities of developing countries, MITI will 
effectivate technology cooperation aimed at the transfer of 
existing technologies as well as joint R&amp;D between Japanese 
research organizations and the research organizations of 
developing countries. 
  That research cooperation will not only help to solve the 
individual technology development problems of the developing 
countries. Joint research with Japan's research organizations 
will also help to improve R&amp;D capabilities, which are 
essential 
for the independent development of developing countries.

<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  Japanese society and its economy continue to undergo 
remarkable changes: diversification and sophistication in the 
people's lifestyle and consciousness, changes in regional and 
industrial structures, a society made up of increasingly more 
elderly people, and globalization. In addition, there are calls 
for worldwide cooperation in tackling global environmental 
problems as an issue common to all of humanity. Towards the goal 
of coping with these socio-economic changes and improving the 
standard of living, technological development in the field of 
transportation plays an increasingly important role. 
  During FY93 the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will develop 
railway technology, automotive technology, shipbuilding 
technology, ocean-utilization technology, space-development 
technology, and so forth, and will promote the development of 
technology that covers many fields: improving traffic and 
transportation safety, improving port and harbor construction 
technology, mitigating natural disasters, improving 
disaster-prevention technology, preventing pollution, preserving 
the environment, etc. 
  Table 1 summarizes the MOT-related Special Coordination 
Funds 
for Promoting S&amp;T in the FY93 budget. The subtotal of major 
expenses for research institutes that are under the MOT's 
control increased 3.3&percnt;. As for administrative department 
expenses, transport technology R&amp;D expenses increased 
3.6&percnt;, and 
geostationary meteorological satellite operation expenses 
increased 19.9&percnt;, resulting in a 19.1&percnt; increase in 
the 
subtotal. The overall expenses under MOT jurisdiction increased 
9.8&percnt;, indicating growth that corresponds to the 
importance of 
R&amp;D in the field of transportation. 
  In addition to those expenses, &yen;5.767 billion as 
subsidies for the development of railway technology, such as 
superconductive magnetic levitation train technology, and 
&yen;996 million as subsidies for advanced ship technology 
R&amp;D 
are appropriated in the general account.

<H5>  B. Research at Major Research Institutes </H5>
  Table 2 shows the items implemented as special research in 
FY93, centering on MOT research institutes. This table also 
includes research items based on budgets appropriated in lump 
sums for other ministries and agencies and special accounts. 
Below we will explain those items that warrant special mention, 
centering on new research items. 
<H3>  1. Research on Structural Safety Evaluation To Accommodate 
Lighter-Weight Ships </H3>
  From now on, the demand for larger and faster ships is 
expected to increase, and various types of high-speed ships are 
being developed in Japan and other countries. With that, the 
current safety standards for light-structure ships are being 
revised by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and 
safety standards for the new high-speed ships are being studied 
in Japan as well. This research involves investigating 
structural safety, which is closely related to the safety of 
high-speed ships. Because the existing design standards are not 
applicable to some parts of the new types of ships, 
necessitating safety evaluation by means of direct calculations, 
the MOT will investigate weight-setting methods, structural 
analysis methods, and strength evaluation methods for that; 
clarify the necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring 
safety; and study methods of safety inspections based on actual 
ship measurements. 
<H3>  2. Research on Aircraft Monitoring Methods for Shorter 
Vertical Control Intervals </H3>
  With the increase in the volume of air traffic, it is 
expected that altitudes of 29,000 ft and higher 1,000-ft 
vertical intervals will have to be adopted in order to 
effectively use air space. With that there has arisen a need for 
setting up a system that monitors, detects, and excludes 
aircraft whose altitude maintenance error exceeds a certain 
value. This effort involves researching the feasibility, 
configuration, etc., of a monitoring system for the purpose of 
establishing technology for monitoring aircraft altitude 
maintenance error. 
<H3>  3. Research on Advanced Earthquake-Resistant Design Methods 
for Seaside Facilities To Withstand Strong Earthquakes Directly 
Beneath Tokyo </H3>
  Recently, the increasing probability of a powerful 
earthquake 
occurring directly beneath Tokyo has been indicated, and the 
investigation of how Tokyo's seaside facilities will hold up in 
such a scenario has become an urgent issue. Accordingly, the MOT 
will conduct research to infer earthquake engineering 
characteristics, the dynamic behavior of structures and 
foundations that would result from such an earthquake, the 
amount of structural deformation in such a disaster, etc., in 
order to improve the level of earthquake-resistant design 
methods for seaside facilities. 
<H3>  4. Research on Technology for Evaluating the Safety of 
Advanced Urban Railway Transit Systems </H3>
  The introduction of "advanced transit systems" that use new 
technology in urban rail lines is thought to be very effective 
in solving problems such as congestion during commuting hours 
and the longer amounts of time people spend on trains. However, 
there have been hardly any technical evaluations of these 
advanced transit systems, and there has been little progress in 
making those systems practical. Therefore, safety evaluation 
technology must be improved so that it can handle the new 
technology and thereby facilitate the introduction of these 
transit systems. This research involves investigating technology 
for evaluating transit safety, brake performance, and train 
operation security systems, and gathering data on the safety of 
advanced transit systems. 
<H3>  5. Research on Advanced Technology for Predicting Global 
Warming </H3>
  Owing to the increase in atmospheric CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  caused 
by fossil fuel consumption, global-scale warming has become an 
international issue; warming prediction, socio-economic affects, 
and measures for coping with global warming are being 
investigated in the IPCC. Because there will be an abundance of 
observational data in the late 1990s from programs such as TOGA 
and WOCE, this research involves developing technology for 
comprehensively analyzing that data, maintaining grid-point 
climate data, and developing atmospheric-ocean-coupled models of 
the entire globe. 
<H3>  6. Research on Methods of Platform Testing ABS-Equipped 
Large Vehicles </H3>
  Although regulations mandating ABS (anti-lock brake system) 
installation in combination vehicles and large buses are 
enforced, tests of ABS performance during usage have not been 
implemented, and only the electronic control sections of ABS 
systems are inspected. With the increase in ABS-equipped 
vehicles from now on, mandating periodic inspections 
necessitates the development of platform testing devices with 
which performance tests equivalent to road tests can be 
reproduced for the purpose of confirming the state of ABS 
operation during braking and the resulting safety. This research 
involves investigating the performance requirements for platform 
testing devices, formulating the specifications of and 
trial-producing a device, and obtaining materials on testing 
methods. 
<H5>  7. Research on the Application of NO </H5>
&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt; -Reduction 
Technology to Medium-Weight Gasoline Tank Trucks (Expenses for 
National Laboratories' Test Research on Pollution Prevention, 
etc.) 
  Countermeasures against diesel exhaust are urgently needed 
because environmental levels of NO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  are not achieved 
near major urban roadways and floating particulates cause health 
problems. Such measures, however, are technologically difficult. 
If the kind of technology used in passenger cars for dealing 
with exhaust gas can be applied to medium-weight gasoline tank 
trucks, that would be an effective way to prevent air pollution 
in the future. This research effort involves studying ideal 
NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt; -reduction technology that can be applied in 
medium-weight gasoline tank trucks (catalytic converter rhodium, 
etc.), measures for improving the durability of catalysts, and 
other such technology for practical use. 
<H3>  8. Research on Advanced Methods of Identifying Trace Amounts 
of Lubricating Oil (Expenses for National Laboratories' Test 
Research on Pollution Prevention, etc.) </H3>
  After fuel oil, the most prevalent leakage from bilges into 
the ocean is generally a mixture of fuel oil and lubricating 
oil. As time passes, the low-boiling-point components evaporate 
and mostly lubricating oil remains, but, with analysis methods 
up until now, identifying lubricating oil had been difficult. In 
recent years, however, the functions of analysis equipment have 
improved, and the analysis of high-boiling-point components in 
lubricating oil has become possible. This research involves 
investigating methods of analyzing those components, then 
combining those with existing methods to establish a way to 
identify bilges and lubricating oil with a high degree of 
accuracy. 
<H3>  9. Research on Technology for Utilizing Human Perception and 
Sensory Functions in Nuclear Power Plant Operation (Expenses for 
Nuclear Power Test Research at National Laboratories) </H3>
  In the operation of nuclear power plants and other such 
large-scale systems, conveying plant information to the 
operators through physical models is effective, but the manner 
in which the information is conveyed to operators must be 
compatible with human perception and sensory functions. For that 
reason, providing information that is selected with 
consideration for human capabilities and characteristics is 
important. In this effort researchers will investigate ways to 
convey information so that whatever is currently happening in a 
plant can be recognized with the five human senses, the purpose 
of which is to accurately convey automated, black-box plant 
information; operational methods based on the information that 
is conveyed; and ways for operators to be able to sense the 
effects of operations on the plant. 
<H3>  10. Basic Research on Foundation Measures for Nuclear Power 
Facilities in Coastal Regions (Expenses for Nuclear Power Test 
Research at National Laboratories) </H3>
  Because harbors are important as transportation nodes, basic 
research must be accumulated in connection with radioactive 
substance transport measures, nuclear power facilities in 
coastal regions, and evaluation of the safety of those.

&lt;sup&gt; *&lt;/sup&gt;  Indicates new research that starts in FY93. This table does not 
include research based on Expenses for the Promotion of S&amp;T and Expenses for 
Promotion of Global Environmental Research. 


<H5>  C. Transport Technology R&amp;D Expenses </H5>
  These are R&amp;D survey expenses that have been 
appropriated 
since FY82 for facilitating cooperation between the government 
and private sector in the R&amp;D of transport technology that 
relates to many fields. Table 3 shows the research that MOT will 
conduct in FY93. 
  One such effort, "research studies on the development of 
transport-related multipurpose satellite systems," involves the 
development of repeaters for search-and-rescue communications 
(SAR) demonstration experiments. 
  "Research studies on establishing comprehensive safety 
measures to cope with the changes in traffic environments in 
recent years" involves the development of technology pertaining 
to harbor facilities that will accommodate the safe navigation 
of super-high-speed ships during the night and in congested 
areas, the objective of which is to shift the demand away from 
road transportation, where worsening traffic environments are 
becoming a social problem, to marine transport. 
  The objective of "development of on-rail trailers for 
low-pollution goods distribution" is to develop an on-rail 
trailer system that is suitable for faster combination vehicles, 
improved conveyance technology, smaller yard work space, and 
labor saving in order to facilitate converting the transport 
mode from trucks to railway in mid- and long-distance freight 
transport. 
  "Research on public transport technology for the elderly and 
disabled" involves R&amp;D of bus systems suitable for use by 
elderly and physically handicapped people, terminal guidance 
systems for visually impaired people, etc., because reducing the 
physical burden involved and improving safety are essential for 
the use of public transport by elderly and handicapped people.

<H5>  D. Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Operation </H5>
  There are plans to launch the next-term geostationary 
meteorological satellite (GMS-5) in FY94, the objectives of 
which are to continue satellite-based meteorological 
observations, to improve technology relating to meteorological 
satellites, and so forth. As the development expenses for that, 
&yen;4.519 billion are appropriated in FY93. 
<H5>  E. Summary of Global-Environmental-Related Budget </H5>
  The MOT has been tackling global-scale environmental 
problems 
since long ago. Continually working in cooperation with 
concerned international organizations, the ministry brings about 
numerous results in areas such as those related to global 
warming, destruction of the ozone layer, marine pollution, etc. 
  With a budget of about &yen;8.800 billion in FY93, the MOT 
will continue to actively wrestle with global-scale 
environmental problems: it will strive to strengthen 
observation, monitoring, and forecasting systems; elucidate the 
mechanisms of environmental changes and assess those effects; 
and so forth. Table 4 shows the main items in that budget.

<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  The important S&amp;T-related measures of the Ministry of 
Posts 
and Telecommunications (MPT) are 1) promoting pioneering R&amp;D 
in 
the field of telecommunications; 2) "Telecommunications Frontier 
R&amp;D," which promotes R&amp;D of basic, advanced technologies 
in the 
field of telecommunications; 3) space communications technology 
R&amp;D; 4) global environmental measurement technology R&amp;D; 
and 5) 
radio-wave utilization technology R&amp;D. 
  1) &yen;193.00 million were newly approved this fiscal year 
for "pioneering R&amp;D in the field of telecommunications" 
because 
the active promotion of R&amp;D in telecommunications, a field in 
which technology is highly advanced, is essential in order to 
have an advanced information society in the 21st century. 
  2) &yen;802.00 million are appropriated in this year's 
budget 
for "Telecommunications Frontier R&amp;D," which involves basic, 
leading-edge R&amp;D projects that will contribute to 
advancements 
in telecommunications. 
  3) &yen;1.265 billion are appropriated in this year's budget 
for advanced satellite communications R&amp;D, etc., the purpose 
of 
which is to establish Japan's future independent technology base 
in space development. 
  4) &yen;378 million are appropriated for the R&amp;D of 
technologies aimed at global-scale environmental conservation, 
e.g., remote sensing technology in which electromagnetic waves 
are used for environmental observations, and for surveys of 
developments relating to radio-wave utilization and information 
communications for global environmental conservation. 
  5) &yen;94.00 million are appropriated in the FY93 budget 
for 
several R&amp;D efforts to develop frequency bands not yet used 
and 
redevelop frequency bands that are already used, and the R&amp;D 
of 
stratospheric radio relay systems. 
  The R&amp;D expenses of the Communications Research 
Laboratory 
account for most of the MPT's S&amp;T general account budget. As 
the 
only national laboratory that handles information and 
communications, the Communications Research Laboratory does 
wide-ranging research, from basic to applied, that covers the 
fields of information, communications, and radio. The MPT set up 
a Kansai branch in May 1989 as a base for carrying out basic and 
advanced R&amp;D centering on Telecommunications Frontier 
R&amp;D, set 
up new government research offices, and outfitted a full-scale 
research system there that was completed in August 1991. The 
MPT's S&amp;T general account budget is &yen;7.882 billion, in 
which 
&yen;7.298 billion are for the Communications Research 
Laboratory (see Table 1). 
  As for special-accounts-related funds, money from the 
Industrial Investments Special Account will go toward new 
investments in communications and broadcasting facilities during 
FY93, and will provide the necessary funds for maintaining 
special R&amp;D base facilities. And, as a measure for activating 
public-sector R&amp;D activities, the MPT will promote financing 
and 
investment enterprises of the Japan Key Technology Center.

<H3>  B. Promotion of Pioneering R&amp;D in the Field of 
Telecommunications </H3>
  R&amp;D of Advanced 3-D Image Information Communication 
Technology 
  The active promotion of R&amp;D in the high-tech field of 
telecommunications is essential in order to have an advanced 
information society in the 21st century. However, it is a 
high-risk, high-burden field where it is difficult for the 
private sector to develop technology on its own. Therefore the 
government must actively promote pioneering R&amp;D that bridges 
the 
gap between basic research and applications. 
  To that end, since FY92 the MPT has been marshalling the 
technological strength and talent of industry, government, and 
universities to carry out R&amp;D on technology for sophisticated 
3-D-image information communications using holographic 
technology. The MPT will continue that effort during FY93 as 
well. 
<H5>  C. Telecommunications Frontier R&amp;D </H5>
  In order to establish the technology base to support an 
advanced information society in the 21st century, since FY88 the 
MPT in cooperation with industry, other government 
organizations, and universities has been carrying out 
"Telecommunications Frontier R&amp;D," which is basic and 
pioneering 
R&amp;D in the field of telecommunications . 
  In FY93 the MPT will continue R&amp;D efforts from FY92 on 
seven 
topics in three fields and will add one new topic. The MPT will 
also expand its selection of public-subscription research, which 
is broad and general research themes that the ministry offers 
for public subscription. In addition to setting up places for 
research exchange with the researchers of the world, the 
ministry will also promote international joint research by 
extending invitations to foreign researchers. 
  The following is a summary of the individual R&amp;D themes. 
<H5>  1. Super-High-Speed Communications Technology </H5>
  (1) R&amp;D of Super-High-Speed, High-Performance 
Communications 
Technology Based on High-Temperature Superconductors 
  The MPT systematically carries out basic research and 
development relating to various uses of the superconductivity 
effect in telecommunications. This effort involves the R&amp;D of 
super-high-sensitivity reception technology based on 
superconducting elements, high-efficiency superconducting 
antennas, and technology to counter superconductivity EMI 
(electromagnetic interference). 
  (2) R&amp;D of Unexplored Electromagnetic-Wave Technology 
  This involves the R&amp;D of vacuum ultraviolet coherent 
light 
source technology, technology for generating squeezed light, 
electromagnetic wave technology based on semiconductor carriers 
(far-infrared laser light), and ultra-short-pulse, high-output 
light sources. 
<H5>  2. Bio-Intelligent Communications Technology </H5>
  (1) R&amp;D of Super-Efficient Encoding Technology Based on 
Sensory Organ Models 
  The objective of this R&amp;D is to efficiently compress and 
reduce the increasingly larger amounts of information handled in 
telecommunications. This effort involves the development of 
information processing methods that model the excellent sensory 
mechanisms of humans (the feature extraction functions of 
vision, etc.), and the R&amp;D of technology to encode sensory 
information, such as voice and image information. 
  (2) R&amp;D of Meta-Intelligent Functions for 
Next-Generation 
Communications 
  This research involves modelling on a computer the 
high-level 
intelligent activities of humans, and building a 
voice-recognition/response system with advanced functions for 
inference, learning, association, conceptualization, etc. 
  (3) R&amp;D in Connection with Biofunctions 
  This is to develop technology for making non-destructive 
measurements of the functions with which living organisms 
respond to biochemical stimuli and receive, transmit, and 
process information. The objectives of this effort are to 
elucidate the physical and chemical characteristics of the 
macromolecules, cells, cell membranes, and other such components 
of living organisms, and to elucidate the organic information 
system mechanisms of living organisms. 
  (4) R&amp;D of Molecular Element Technology for Advanced 
Information Communications (New) 
  This is to research and develop basic technologies such as 
molecule manipulation technology, molecule assembly technology, 
and technology for evaluating those characteristics. The 
objectives of this effort are the development of advanced 
information communications elements that are a breakaway from 
conventional semiconductors, and the realization of functional, 
high-density, high-efficiency molecular elements whose base 
materials are biomolecules and organic molecules. 
<H5>  3. Highly-Functional Network Technology </H5>
  (1) R&amp;D of Basic Technology for 
Super-Multiply-Changeable 
Networks 
  This is the R&amp;D of basic technologies for functionally 
optimizable changeable networks that have multiple information 
sources, i.e, the R&amp;D of control technology for sophisticated 
integrated networks that integrate both cabled and wireless 
connections, and advanced communications processing technology 
in wide-area networks. 
  (2) R&amp;D of Network-Human Interfaces 
  This is basic research to realize intelligent interfaces, 
with which networks can comprehend intentionally ambiguous human 
expressions, so that the advanced functions of next-generation 
communications networks will be easy to use. 
<H5>  4. Telecommunications Frontier Research Public Subscription </H5>
  The purposes of this effort are to supplement and perfect 
basic and pioneering R&amp;D, to foster creative research by 
young 
and talented researchers, and to improve regional R&amp;D 
capabilities. 
<H3>  D. Major FY93 Research Efforts at the Communications 
Research Laboratory </H3>
<H3>  1. R&amp;D of Advanced Satellite Communications and Broadcast 
Technology </H3>
  This is the R&amp;D of advanced migrator satellite 
communications 
technology that uses the Ka band and millimeter-wave band, and 
advanced satellite broadcast technology that uses the Ka band 
(21 GHz) in the communications satellites that will be launched 
by an H-II rocket in FY96 (COMETS). 
  During FY93, the MPT will continue the development of 
repeaters that will be mounted on satellites, and will begin the 
development of on-ground experimental facilities. 
<H3>  2. Research on a Next-Generation Communications-Broadcast 
R&amp;D Satellite </H3>
  Aiming for the realization of early-21st-century migrator 
digital voice broadcasts, high-volume inter-satellite 
communications, etc., the MPT is carrying out the necessary 
research for launching the next-generation 
communications-broadcast R&amp;D satellite (COMETS) in FY99. The 
satellite will be loaded with high-output repeaters; a large, 
10-meter, expansive antenna; and inter-satellite communications 
technology that uses millimeter waves and light. 
<H5>  3. R&amp;D of Aviation and Maritime Satellite Technology </H5>
  This is the R&amp;D of aviation and maritime communications 
technology that uses satellites, the objectives of which are to 
guarantee communications with ships and aircraft, and to 
establish systems that can handle on-land mobile communications. 
  During FY93 MPT researchers will continue migrator satellite 
communications experiments using a type-V engineering test 
satellite (ETS-V). Then, based on the results of those 
experiments, they will develop ultra-small portable earth 
stations and equipment for circuit control experiments. 
<H5>  4. R&amp;D of Inter-Satellite Communications Technology </H5>
  The expansion in space activities brings with it the need 
for 
new inter-satellite communication technology and technology for 
building large-scale antennas in space. 
  For that reason, the MPT has developed equipment (repeaters 
and multi-beam antennas) for experimenting with S-band (2-GHz 
band), millimeter-wave and optical inter-satellite 
communications. That equipment will be mounted on a type-VI 
engineering test satellite (ETS-VI) that is scheduled for launch 
in FY94. During FY93 the MPT will be engaged in coordination and 
support tasks involving the satellite equipment developed thus 
far. 
  In connection with the Space Station Program, which is an 
international joint project, the MPT will continue research on 
large antenna assembly technology. 
<H3>  5. R&amp;D of High-Accuracy Time and Space Measurement 
Technology Using Cosmic Radio-Wave Emissions </H3>
  This is to develop "accurate space and time measurement 
technology" suitable for the age of manned space activities. The 
technology will be a fusion and evolution of the space 
measurement technology represented by very-long-based 
interferometry (VLBI), and time measurement technology 
represented by atomic clocks and precise time comparisons. 
  To that end, during FY93 the MPT will continue VLBI 
experiments for observing plate movement around Japan and 
observing fluctuations in the earth's rotation, along with the 
R&amp;D of space VLBI. 
<H5>  6. Research Involving Communications Satellite Experiments </H5>
  Although it is an era when communications satellites are 
actually being put into practical use, considerable 
technological development is needed in order for small- and 
medium-scale users to create advanced information networks that 
exploit the features of communications satellites and then to be 
able to directly access satellites on their own and thereby 
utilize their networks. 
  For that reason, as a satellite communications advanced 
usage 
pilot project, the MPT will use a part of the CS-3 to conduct 
operational experiments on networks in a form that is close to 
actual use. 
<H5>  7. R&amp;D of Space Weather Forecasting Systems </H5>
  Geared toward the age ahead of rapidly evolving space 
communications and manned space activities, this is research for 
the purpose of forecasting the main causes of danger in the 
space environment, such as cosmic radiation that affects humans 
and space equipment, and making practical space weather 
forecasting systems so that such dangers can be avoided. 
  During FY93, the MPT will continue to maintain equipment for 
automatic transmission of remote data and equipment for solar 
magnetism observations, and carry out the basic development of 
space observation equipment for use on-board satellites. 
<H3>  8. Research on Communications Technology Based on Small 
Satellites </H3>
  Small, light-weight satellites are advantageous in that 
communications and observation systems using multiple satellites 
are easy to configure because small satellites are inexpensive 
and can be realized in a short period of time. In addition, such 
satellites can be used for demonstrating satellite-mounted 
equipment and technology in space. 
  The MPT will develop communications technology that is 
suitable for these small satellites, such as store-and-transmit 
technology, inter-satellite data exchange technology, etc., and 
will work to establish the basic technologies for building 
communications systems and observation systems that use small 
satellites. To that end, during FY93 the MPT will develop a 
store-and-transmit communications device EM and inter-satellite 
radar. 
<H3>  9. Augmenting Related Observations During the Term of the 
STEP Program </H3>
  Elucidating from a global viewpoint the processes of solar 
energy transport that change the earth, oceans, and atmosphere 
is essential in order to accurately grasp global environmental 
changes. In combination with the Solar-Terrestrial Energy 
International Joint Research Program (STEP) that runs from 1990 
to 1995, the MPT will carry out supplemental observations using 
the facilities of the Communications Research Laboratory to 
study planetary atmospheres, solar wind, the ionosphere and 
magnetosphere, etc., and through that research make an 
international contribution. 
<H3>  10. Research on Space Communications in Distributed 
Satellite Systems </H3>
  Highly reliable space communications systems will be 
realized 
by the development of technology for distributing several small 
to mid-sized satellites in close orbits and making them operate 
together in linked fashion as a group. To that end, the MPT will 
conduct research on technology for high-precision control of 
satellite orbits and technology for dynamic communications 
circuit control. 
  During FY93 the MPT will develop and test a relative 
satellite tracking device of an orbit control system. 
<H3>  11. Research on Two-Frequency Doppler Radar for Observing 
Rainfall from Space </H3>
  The purpose of the rainfall radar that will be carried on 
the 
TRMM (tropical rainfall observation satellite), the polar 
orbiting platform, and the space station, is global-scale 
observation of rainfall distribution, which significantly 
affects the global environment. The MPT will trial produce 
rainfall radar and will mount that radar on aircraft for 
in-flight experiments, the purposes of which are to investigate 
the basic technologies needed for the development of rainfall 
radar and to study ways to gather and process the data. During 
FY93 the MPT will produce the reception part of the rainfall 
radar that will be carried on aircraft and will trial produce 
and test the data processing section of the rainfall radar that 
will be carried on the TRMM. 
<H3>  12. R&amp;D of Global Environmental Measurement Technology 
Based 
on Sensors That are Active in Certain Optical Regions </H3>
  The MPT will develop active sensors that utilize light 
suitable for accurate global monitoring of the troposphere, 
which accounts for most of the earth's atmosphere. In 
particular, the MPT will develop laser radar for use on-board 
future satellites. 
  During FY93 the MPT will research and develop methods of 
pumping solid-state lasers with semiconductor lasers that will 
lead to longer-life and higher-efficiency solid-state lasers. 
<H3>  13. Research on Global Environmental Measurement Technology 
Using Short-Wavelength Millimeter-Band Electromagnetic Waves </H3>
  In global environmental problems, the importance of 
stratospheric ozone layer formation and extinction, and trace 
amounts of gaseous components such as chlorine compounds and 
nitrogen oxides, which effect the condition of thermodynamic 
stability in the upper layers of the atmosphere, are cited. The 
MPT will research and develop millimeter and sub-millimeter wave 
spectroscopic reception technology that is helpful in observing 
trace amounts of those gaseous components. 
  During FY93 the MPT will continue working on the production 
of 200-GHz-band and 270-GHz-band radio-wave meters, which 
started in FY92, and will develop small, light-weight 
spectrometers for those frequency bands. 
<H3>  14. R&amp;D in Connection With Constructing Global 
Environmental 
Measurement Information Networks </H3>
  The MPT will carry out R&amp;D in connection with a global 
environmental measurement and information network for collecting 
global environmental data from observation points scattered over 
broad areas and converting that data into databases. Through 
that network, environmental researchers will be able to use the 
global environmental data and information obtained by research 
and government organizations within and outside of Japan. To 
that end, since FY91 the MPT has been researching and developing 
technology for retrieving global environmental data and 
information, and technology for interconnecting different kinds 
of networks. 
<H3>  15. International Joint Research on Advanced Electromagnetic 
Wave Utilization Technology for the Global Environment </H3>
  In a joint effort with the University of Alaska in the U.S., 
the MPT will develop equipment for measuring the mid-level 
atmosphere, and, joining in with the U.S.'s high-output 
radio-wave emissions facilities and other such observation and 
experimental facilities in Alaska, the MPT will conduct 
comprehensive observational research of the polar mid-level 
atmosphere to elucidate the mechanisms of global environmental 
fluctuations. 
  In FY93 the MPT will develop an imaging rheometer to measure 
horizontal electron density distribution, a Rayleigh Doppler 
rider for air temperature and wind measurements, and a wide-area 
milliwave radiometer to measure trace amounts of ozone gas in 
the atmosphere. 
<H3>  16. Research on Global Environmental Measurement Technology 
Based on High-Resolution 3-D Microwave Imaging Radar </H3>
  The MPT will develop high-resolution 3-D microwave imaging 
radar that will be carried on aircraft and technology for 
related experiments, data processing, and analysis, the purposes 
of which are to deal with environmental damage and natural 
disasters in a quick and mobile manner and to effectively 
predict environmental changes resulting from that damage. 
  Unlike conventional composite-aperture radar from which only 
flat images can be obtained, clear 3-D images can be obtained 
with this system by using the strength of scattering between two 
antennas and multiple polarized waves, and polarimeter functions 
that accurately measure changes in scattering phase. 
  In FY93 the MPT will develop the main compound 
polarized-wave 
antenna. 
<H5>  17. Development of Frequency Resources </H5>
  (1) Research on 40-GHz and Higher Radio-Wave Propagation 
  This frequency band is characterized by the facts that 
systems utilizing it can be made smaller and lighter, and that 
it enables wide-band, high-density, multi-channel 
communications. In addition, this frequency band has 
applications in remote sensing. The basic atmospheric 
propagation characteristics that take into account attenuation 
due to atmospheric particles (rain, fog, snow, etc.) and the 
scattering due to objects must be adequately grasped. 
  To that end, during FY93 the MPT will continue work from 
FY92 
to maintain a 90- to 100-GHz scattering meter, standard 
scatterers, and a scattering meter calibration device for the 
purpose of conducting scattering meter calibration experiments. 
  (2) R&amp;D of Optical-Region Frequency Bands 
  For the purpose of utilizing the optical regions in which 
huge amounts of information can be transmitted with one beam, 
this effort involves elucidating the characteristics that 
electromagnetic waves have in optical regions, and the R&amp;D of 
optical communications using spatially propagated signals that 
do not degrade under poor atmospheric conditions, such as fog. 
  During FY93 the MPT will maintain the receiving sections 
that 
will be used in model communications experiments and begin the 
trial production of an antenna for both optical and radio-wave 
use. 
  (3) R&amp;D of Technology for Intelligent and Effective 
Utilization of Radio Waves 
  In order to cope with the increasing demand for on-land 
mobile wireless communications and the diversification of 
transmitted information, since FY85 the MPT has been involved in 
R&amp;D for using the quasi-microwave-band in on-land mobile 
communications. During FY93 the MPT will research and develop 
technology for intelligent and effective utilization of radio 
waves that is based on the research results obtained thus far. 
The technology involves dynamically changing system 
configurations in correspondence with the usage of frequencies 
in the quasi-microwave band in order to use radio waves as 
effectively as possible. 
  (4) R&amp;D of Millimeter-Wave Private Communications 
Technology 
  Concomitant with the development of an advanced information 
society in recent years, the demands for high-speed, high-volume 
wireless transmission and private transmission are rapidly 
expanding. 
  To deal with that, MPT's efforts during FY93 involve the 
maintenance of a system for experimenting with millimeter-wave 
radio-wave propagation, fading-related R&amp;D, and trial 
producing 
a flat millimeter-wave antenna. 
  (5) R&amp;D of Mobile Microwave-Band Communications 
Technology 
(New) 
  To cope with the tightness of frequencies concomitant with 
the increased demand for mobile communications and the 
introduction of sophisticated services in recent years, the MPT 
will research and develop the technologies needed for realizing 
microwave-band (3-10 GHz) mobile communications systems. During 
FY93 the MPT will maintain devices for measuring microwave-band 
reception electric field strength characteristics and multipath 
propagation characteristics. 
  (6) R&amp;D of Technology for Effective Utilization of 
Broadcast 
Frequencies (New) 
  To cope with the tightness of ground-based broadcast 
frequencies, the MPT will carry out R&amp;D relating to the basic 
technologies for effective utilization of broadcast frequencies: 
basic technologies relating to the introduction of digital 
technology in broadcasting systems, i.e., achieving narrower 
bandwidths by means of efficient compression, achieving faster 
transmission by efficient modulation, reducing ghost and noise 
trouble, and reducing the electric power needed for transmission. 
  Efforts during FY93 include the investigation of information 
compression technology using encoding methods that are suited to 
broadcasting, and the R&amp;D of technology for efficient 
compression and encoding of high-detail moving images that is 
also applicable to transmission routes where problems such as 
ghost signals are severe. 
  (7) R&amp;D of Millimeter- and Submillimeter-Wave-Band 
Device 
Technology (New) 
  To cope with increasingly greater radio-wave demand from now 
on, the MPT will comprehensively and systematically research and 
develop functional device technology that will become the key 
technology in realizing systems in the as yet unused 70-GHz and 
higher millimeter- and submillimeter-wave bands. 
  During FY93 the MPT will prepare basic film-forming devices 
(sputter devices), etc., and will conduct research on basic 
thin-film formation techniques, etc. 
<H5>  18. R&amp;D of Stratospheric Radio Repeater Systems </H5>
  If unmanned aircraft can be floated in the stratosphere at 
altitudes of about 20 km, where the currents in the upper 
atmosphere are relatively stable, and used as radio repeater 
bases, they would cover broad areas of about 300 km in diameter. 
More so than in the case of satellites, that would also enable 
mobile communications using simple terminals. 
  Aiming for the development of such stratospheric radio 
repeater systems, the MPT has been developing radio repeaters, 
antenna systems, and radio control systems, and will conduct 
R&amp;D 
in connection with electromagnetic environmental measures. 
During FY93 the MPT will maintain the receiving sections of a 
microwave power transmission experiment system and will equip 
the data storage section of an electromagnetic environmental 
measurement device. 
<H5>  E. Summary of FY93 Industrial Investment Special Account </H5>
<H5>  1. Maintenance of R&amp;D Base Facilities </H5>
  To maintain the large facilities used in the R&amp;D of 
advanced 
telecommunications technology, large sums of money are needed in 
comparison with the frequency of usage, and there are 
difficulties in single-handedly maintaining such facilities. 
These kinds of facilities and equipment are maintained as 
"special R&amp;D base facilities" by government support through 
communications and broadcasting organizations, and are provided 
for joint use to people engaged in R&amp;D pertaining to 
telecommunications technology. 
  During FY93 the MPT will continue to maintain advanced image 
communications facilities, etc., as special R&amp;D base 
facilities. 
<H3>  2. Japan Key Technology Center Funding and Investment 
Enterprises </H3>
  Established in 1985 in accordance with the Law for 
Facilitating Research in Key Technologies, the Japan Key 
Technology Center was instituted for the purpose of supporting 
private-sector research in key technologies that is difficult 
for the private sector to promote on its own. Through the Japan 
Key Technology Center's loans and investments, the MPT provides 
support so that telecommunications R&amp;D in the private sector 
will be energetically and smoothly facilitated. 
  Table 3 shows new telecommunications R&amp;D efforts that 
the MPT 
started as investment projects in FY91. As for financed 
projects, 11 efforts in the field of telecommunications were 
started in FY91. The contents of the research cover many 
branches: radio and satellite communications, transmission, 
image communications, networks, etc.

  New multimedia communication will be explored by providing 
service to homes and businesses. Concrete plans for field trials 
are being finalized. B-ISDN will be realized and total 
communication and broadcasting services will be the goal with 
several trials to begin in 1994. 
  The real purpose is to develop new applications using high 
speed and wide area networks that will become the 21st century 
infrastructure. Verification of market needs, and the resolution 
of legal problems that may arise along with the provision of 
service will take place concurrently. The experiments will be 
conducted mainly by the private sector with the support of 
government agencies such as MPT (Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications). 
  By building high speed and wide area networks, multimedia 
communication service will be provided to businesses and homes. 
Led by MPT, plans for multimedia communication service field 
trials that will be conducted by private companies are reaching 
concrete levels. Emphasis will be on verification of application 
development, feasibility of the business, and problem 
resolution. Experiments will start in 1994 (see Table 1 and 
Figure 1). 



<H3>  Two Experiments In Kansai Area Are Planned To Start In July 
1994 </H3>
  At the end of July, equipment specifications provided by the 
``Pilot Business Model for New Generation Communication 
Network'' (Experiment In Total Communication And Broadcasting) 
lead by MPT were finalized and plans reached a concrete level. 
In reality, optical fiber was installed at 300 locations 
centered around the homes of the nearby Kansai Cultural and 
Academic Research City. The infrastructure model of total 
communication and broadcasting service, Fiber-To-The-Home, is to 
be constructed there. Free from the constraints of extant 
communication broadcasting systems, a new multimedia 
communication system for homes will be developed. Thus needs 
will be determined and at the same time, this project has an 
aspect of an ``experiment in reform.'' Companies will be 
recruited and the experiment is planned to continue for 3 years 
starting from July of 1994. 
  Also, near the Kansai Cultural and Academic Research City, 
B-ISDN will be constructed. This ``Experiment For A New 
Generation Of Communication Network Businesses'' aims at the 
development of business applications and is being actively 
explored with a possible starting date of July 1994. The purpose 
is ``to create business opportunities in B-ISDN,'' the project 
is identified in English as, ``BBCC: Broadband - ISDN Business 
Chance Creation'' by the Research Institute Of New Generation 
Communication Networking, that is the main organization 
conducting the research (headquartered in Kyoto City). One 
hundred thirty seven companies including communication 
businesses such as NTT, leading communication equipment makers, 
home electronic makers, and trading and construction companies 
are participating in BBCC. Execution of 13 projects is planned.

<H5>  Experiment With Multimedia Newspaper Also Conceptualized </H5>
  Also the Hyper Network Social Research Institute 
(headquartered in Oita), a non-profit organization backed by MPT 
and MITI has been conceptualizing a ``Hyper Network Social 
Experiment'' that will be conducted in the Oita area. The plan 
is to realize an electronic newspaper by upgrading the pc 
communication service quite active in Oita Prefecture by sending 
images through existing N-ISDN at high speed. The purpose is to 
develop and provide multimedia communication services, and to 
resolve various problems such as privacy and copyright violation 
that may arise in a future in multimedia society. Also 
vitalization of the area is another big part of the project. 
This experiment is still in the stage of conceptualization but 
will be ready for execution beginning in 1994. 
  Plans for new multimedia communication services in various 
fields are appearing. Key words for these experiments include: 
B-ISDN for research on a New Generation Of Communication Network 
Businesses; Fiber-To-The-Home and Experiment In Total 
Communication and Broadcasting for a Pilot Business Model For 
New Generation Communication Network. The purpose of Hyper 
Network Social Experiment is to explore high speed personal 
computer communication. 
<H5>  Two Experiments In Kansai Area Linked Together </H5>
  Although the research on B-ISDN and the pilot model are to 
be 
conducted in the same area of the Kansai Cultural And Academic 
Research City, they were derived differently. 



  The following explains the history of each project. First of 
all, practical experiments on a new generation of communication 
network were conducted in April of 1992, and then Promotion of 
New Generation Communication Network Society (PNES: 
Headquartered in Tokyo) was formed after MPT issued the permit. 
PNES decided to conduct its first experiment in Kansai area, 
thus BBCC was born. 
  On the other hand, the Experiment In Total Communication And 
Broadcasting was hurriedly developed since the supplementary 
budget of &yen;2 billion was granted for the purpose of bringing 
up the economy. The allocated budget had to be spent within the 
year, and the organization to conduct the project had to be 
public corporation. To aid economic recovery, the experiment was 
needed immediately, and since the PNES was already in existence 
as a non-profit organization it was selected as the project 
executor. 
  Thus the experiments on B-ISDN and broadcasting developed 
separately. However both projects share the same application 
experiment. BBCC and PNES will conduct the experiments sharing 
the same equipment at the center and the network. They are 
currently working out the logistics. 
<H6>  B-ISDN Includes Thirteen Projects </H6>
  ``A large high resolution video screen will be built on 
three 
sides of a wall, and video, taped at the nearby aquarium, will 
be projected on the screen creating a space with the feeling of 
being in the aquarium,'' and ``a computer at an architectural 
company and a terminal at the customer service counter will 
connected so that design specifications of a house to be built 
can be discussed interactively using 3D graphics.'' These are 
just two of the goals for B-ISDN. 
  ``Keihanna Plaza'' in Kansai Cultural And Academic Research 
City, and Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara will be connected with optical 
fiber. Experimental applications of B-ISDN will be conducted by 
connecting each network access point to a corporate participant. 
A video studio for high vision images will also be established 
as a B-ISDN experience corner. 



<H5>  Common And Specific Projects Conducted </H5>
  The planned total of 13 experiments is divided into common 
and specific projects. The common projects will be conducted by 
137 companies associated with the BBCC.

  On the other hand, specific projects will be conducted by 
the 
companies that are recruited and will be funded by those 
companies. Although participating companies have not yet been 
announced publicly, as an example, communication equipment 
makers will participate in the study of high speed LANs. The 
router that interfaces with ATM (Asynchronous Transmission Mode) 
developed by the participating makers will be established at 
existing LANs (FDDI or EtherNet), so that actually ATM circuits 
will be connected and used between LANs. 
  Home appliance makers will participate in projects involving 
the design and architecture of houses by using interactive 
computer graphics. Printing companies will participate in 
projects on satellite electronic editing and printing, and 
medical equipment makers will participate in the investigation 
of remote medical treatment. 
  Also for applications aiming at the home market such as 
electronic catalogs using multimedia, a study will be conducted 
in which optical fiber connected to homes for the Experiment In 
Total Communication And Broadcasting is extended and leased out 
as an accompanying project. 
<H5>  Permanent Virtual Circuits Used In ATM Network </H5>
  The specifications for the ATM network used in this 
experiment employ PVC (Permanent Virtual Circuits) that requires 
the registration of a party with an ATM node. The reason why the 
party is not selectable freely is that the specifications for 
ATM public network service (signal protocol) have not yet been 
standardized. Circuits with a physical speed of 156M bit/second 
are used to access an ATM node from the user's side and for 
links between ATM nodes. 
  Data from the user's side is divided into an ATM cell with a 
unit of 53 bytes, then the signal is sent to an ATM network at 
various speeds ranging from several M to 10's of M bit/second 
depending on the terminal. 
  Also, at this time the network is divided into a video image 
group and a communication group. This is because the main 
concern of the experiment is not placed on technical development 
but rather on the development of applications. In the video 
image group, high vision images will be transmitted with digital 
compression. And the image codec (digital compression, and 
enlargement device) employs a 150 M bit/second fixed speed 
rather than the newly developed codec which is a variable rate 
device. For this reason, the speed of the video image is fixed, 
and the video image group became separate. 
  BBCC will use this network application, and experiments will 
be conducted. As the experiments advance, the fee structure of 
B-ISDN paid by users will become clear. However, quite a few 
express the opinion that if service is extended to homes, the 
collection of fees would be difficult unless the service 
includes not only communication but also a wide range of 
broadcasting services such as those offered by CATV. Study is 
still needed to provide the total communication and broadcasting 
service. 
<H3>  New Service With Existing Technology In The Experiment In 
Total Communication And Broadcasting </H3>
  On the other hand, in the Pilot Business Model For New 
Generation Communication Network, CATV broadcasting service (61 
channels) and N-ISDN (64k - 1.5M bit/second) will be provided 
simultaneously on a single optical fiber cable. The homes in the 
area of Kansai Cultural And Academic Research City will be 
connected with optical fiber, and research will be conducted. 
This experiment will be executed using a fund of &yen;2 billion 
supplemented by the government and &yen;3 billion collected by 
the private sector. 
  At present, companies are being widely recruited, and an 
increased number of participants including the corporations 
associated with BBCC as well as companies outside of BBCC are 
sought. Foreign companies such as CATV businesses in the U.S. 
have also been contacted for their participation. In the middle 
of this coming October, the overall members including equipment 
makers and participating companies will be finalized. The 
experiment is planned to continue for three years. 
<H3>  Possible Production Of TV Program By Participation Of 
Audience </H3>
  In this experiment, the dividing wall between communication 
and broadcasting systems will be eliminated, so that new 
applications will be developed by integrating communication and 
broadcasting as a whole, and the feasibility of business 
development will be studied. Although detailed contents of the 
experiments are not yet finalized, Table 3 shows the 
applications that are envisioned.

  First of all, as an extended CATV service, it will become 
possible for TV programs to be seen anytime when viewers desire. 
Utilizing the merit of multiple channels, Near-Video-On-Demand, 
by which the same TV program is broadcast on several channels at 
30 minute intervals, and Video-On-Demand by which a viewer can 
request programs at any time from a central location equipped 
with a video server will be realized. Also for example, the 
experiment conceptualizes the viewer able to select and switch 
screen views that are broadcast with multiple video cameras 
using multiple channels. 
  New applications combining broadcasting and communication 
will become possible. For example, it will become possible to 
produce a TV program in which the viewer can participate through 
telephone or alter the story by voting. 
  Through the use of N-ISDN, remote medical treatment or 
telecommuting by using TV conferencing and video phone will 
become feasible. Also, high resolution image and text 
information may be stored in a still picture database so that an 
electronic library and electronic catalog shopping become 
possible. 
  In order to study the business feasibility of these 
services, 
a fee structure will be established for each application and the 
service will be provided to users. 
<H5>  Ready Within the Year By Using Existing Technology </H5>
  Looking at the system, the experiment this time employs 
existing technology and products. This is because the experiment 
was conceived to stimulate the economy, and immediate execution 
is needed. Analog video images will be transmitted using optical 
fiber. The transmission of data will use N-ISDN rather than ATM. 



  The equipment and machines to be used at the center were 
announced publicly on 30 July. The specifications for the 
network are based on the system that NTT developed. By using 
optical wavelength multiplexing technology, analog video images 
and N-ISDN can be transmitted simultaneously over a single 
optical fiber. 
  Also, for video image transmission such as CATV, the 
``Demand 
Access Optical CATV System,'' a technology developed by the NHK 
technical research lab, will be employed. Two hundred fifty out 
of 300 households participating in the experiment are using the 
NTT system, and 50 households are based on NHK system. 
  Both system will commonly support 61 channels. Thirty one 
channels are set for continuous flow video transmission. The 
remaining 30 channels are allocated for each household to use 
individually (simultaneous use is maximum of 30 households per 
system). Either way, control signals such as data to request 
programming is transmitted to the center via N-ISDN. 
  The difference between the two systems is whether all 
channels are transmitted to a home via optical fiber (NTT 
System), or only channels selected by the household are 
transmitted (NHK System). In other words, the channel selection 
function will be enabled at either the terminal side, or center 
side. That difference is viewed as depending on whether the cost 
can be allocated for the terminal side or center side. Whether 
the equipment cost is distributed at the center side and 
terminal side will make a difference in the total cost. In this 
experiment, the economy of the systems will be studied. 
<H3>  Advancement Of Personal Computer Toward Multimedia 
Electronic Newspaper </H3>
  Although it is at a conceptual stage, the Hyper Network 
Social Research Lab based in Oita Prefecture is looking toward 
the experiment to vitalize the local economy. As part of a 
``Hyper Network Social Experiment'', the center has tender 
thoughts of a multimedia newspaper. The concept is that a few 
minutes of news video can be provided by the existing TV station 
or newspaper company as the basis for multimedia text or video 
news. The video is compressed digitally, and then distributed to 
users via the network from a multimedia news station. Also users 
can send their comments by transmitting a digitally compressed 
image to the multi-media news station. 



  Along with the emulation of new forms of news media, as it 
progresses the experiment also has the purpose of resolving 
various problems that may arise in a future multimedia society 
such as privacy and copyright violation. By enabling multimedia, 
vitalization of local economy is also a goal. 
  Although it is at a conceptual stage at this point, by 
upgrading the personal computer system, the exploration of pc 
communication is also under consideration. The area that the 
experiment takes place, Oita Prefecture, is quite active in 
personal computer communication (i.e. Toyo-No-Kuni Network). By 
upgrading the base network to 1.5M bit/second, the communication 
network is going to shift to the Internet protocol using TCP/IP. 
For the main network and user circuits, existing communication 
service will be used. 
  At present, the center is formulating concrete plans for the 
experiment by studying communication networks, system 
configurations, and video compression technology. After the cost 
and plans are finalized, the center would like to start the 
experiment as soon as possible which will likely be sometime in 
1994. 
  Will these experiments be merely a test or lead to 
commercial 
use? Corporate participation will be influenced by this factor. 
For example, if the experiment on communication and broadcasting 
remains a special test case, then will corporate participants be 
satisfied? The organization is having a tough time in recruiting 
companies, and one of the reasons why not many companies so far 
have shown interest is the uncertain outcome of the experiments. 
In order to create the incentive for companies to participate, 
the government must remove the barriers and it must clearly 
demonstrate the attitude that these experiments will lead to 
commercial applications.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric has developed short-wavelength, 
high-output oscillation technology using a solid-state YAG 
laser. It was difficult to obtain the high-output 
short-wavelength laser light because the wavelength conversion 
element, which transforms the YAG laser light (infrared light) 
into short-wavelength light, tends to cause crystal destruction. 
The company avoided crystal destruction by bringing about a 
``gentle frequency conversion.'' It achieved this by lengthening 
the frequency conversion element and increasing the optical beam 
size of the YAG laser by an order of millimeters 10 times that 
of conventional types. Using this technology, Mitsubishi 
achieved the oscillation of 24 watt green laser light. 
Furthermore, it is said that not only green laser light but also 
blue laser light and other high output oscillations are possible. 
  The solid state laser which oscillates short-wavelength 
laser 
light consists of an excitation light source, a YAG laser (a 
yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser doped with niobium), a nonlinear 
optical material which is the wavelength conversion element, and 
other components. The excited YAG laser emits 1064 nanometer 
infrared light which, after passing through the wavelength 
conversion element, oscillates green, blue and other 
short-wavelength light. However, the wavelength conversion 
element crystal was too brittle to withstand the strong infrared 
light. 
  The company enlarged the spot size of the infrared light 
entering the wavelength conversion element by an order of 
millimeters for the purpose of dispersing the energy and, at the 
same time, it lengthened the wavelength conversion element. 
Several crystals were connected together because the maximum 
size for the wavelength conversion element crystal is 10 
millimeters. The optimal phase matching of their adjoining parts 
has been designed in order to minimize conversion loss. 
Accordingly, even when high output infrared radiation enters, 
the destruction of the wavelength conversion element crystal 
does not occur. 
  Employing this technology, and using a KTP (potassium 
titanate phosphate) wavelength conversion element which halves 
the wavelength, a 24 watt (electric power input 4.9 kilowatts) 
green laser light (532 nanometer wavelength) generation was 
attained. This is double the output achieved up until the 
present time and it is said that it is possible to have an 
output of more than 100 watts. Moreover, this technology can be 
applied to other wave conversion elements, such as 
KNb&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt;  (potassium niobium&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; ) which converts 
the wavelength to one third -- a blue wavelength.

  [Text] When talks on intellectual property rights resume 20 
Dec. in Tokyo, U.S. negotiators will again urge Japan to resist 
proposals spearheaded by Japanese business and academia to ease 
copyright protection of computer programs. 
  The U.S. government and a group of major U.S. computer and 
software firms fear that Japanese companies are seeking changes 
in the nation's copyright law that would make it easier to study 
or copy computer software for commercial purposes through a 
practice known as decompilation. 
  They suspect the intent is to help Japanese firms catch up 
in 
a field dominated by Americans by allowing companies to freely 
analyze each others' programs. 
  International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc., 
Word Perfect Corp., Microsoft Corp. and others say their 
competitive edge in a market worth tens of billions of dollars 
annually could be severely harmed by weaker protection of their 
intellectual property. 
  Yet at hearings last week held by an advisory panel to the 
Agency for Cultural Affairs charged with reviewing software 
copyright law, it became clear that the U.S. computer industry 
is not of one mind. 
  That's because a group of some 30 U.S. companies, led by Sun 
Microsystems Inc. and Storage Technology Corp., believes 
Washington should not oppose Tokyo on certain copyright changes 
now under consideration. 
<H5>  EC Debate </H5>
  The conflicting U.S. views underscore the controversy and 
confusion surrounding proposals to clarify protection of 
computer software under Japanese law. The issue has previously 
sparked intra-industry conflict in the European Community, where 
limited decompilation for the purpose of creating a compatible 
program is permitted. 
  Decompilation is a procedure that reverses the process of 
writing software. By ``translating'' the ones and zeros that 
computers understand into more readable language, it is possible 
to learn how a program works. 
  Often, a company makes this readable code available to 
software publishers -- say firms that plan to write new programs 
that will work together with the first -- under carefully 
phrased contracts that limit the use of the code. 
  Some in Japan favor leaving the Japanese law as it now 
stands, even though it is somewhat unclear on the issue. Some 
favor loosening current protection to allow decompilation, even 
without a business contract, for the sole purpose of ensuring 
``interoperability.'' 
  But the most vocal Japanese are those who want decompilation 
to be permitted for any reason -- and they are represented by 
Keidanren, Japan's most influential business organization. 
  Backed by leading electronics firms such as Fujitsu Ltd., 
Keidanren submitted a report to the advisory panel in September 
recommending that ``copying and modifying of programs with 
reverse engineering should be allowed regardless of purpose.'' 
  ``IBM and other companies want monopolies even as they 
advertise open competition. Fujitsu and other leading Japanese 
electronics companies favor unlimited decompilation'' in order 
to encourage open systems, said Fujitsu director Katsuro Yamaji. 
  One U.S. group, known as the American Committee for 
Interoperable Systems (ACIS), is backing the Japanese -- at 
least part way. Representatives of this group told the advisory 
panel that it favors revising the law to allow decompilation for 
the purpose of ensuring smooth interoperability. 
&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  John Scroppo, vice president of Storage Technology's Japan 
arm, said that U.S. firms often need to sell products in Japan 
that are compatible with those of major Japanese makers. 
Scroppo's firm sells data storage devices to Hitachi Ltd. and 
other big Japanese vendors that have proprietary software. If a 
vendor won't provide information that allows products to work 
together, Scroppo said, U.S. and Japanese companies should be 
able to resort to decompilation. 
<H5>  U.S. Precedent </H5>
  Permitting decompilation benefits computer users, he said, 
because ``the end result is increased innovation, 
interoperability and price competition.'' 
  Scroppo and other proponents of decompilation have taken 
heart from recent U.S. court cases in which decompilation was 
ruled permissible for the purpose of creating interoperable 
systems. 
  Opponents of the practice, however, contend these cases do 
not set a wide precedent for decompilation. 
  Indeed, IBM and its powerful allies fear that giving even an 
inch would encourage Japanese companies to take a mile. They 
worry that instead of looking at the decompiled software just 
for interoperability purposes, the Japanese firms would be able 
to quickly introduce near-copies of the original programs. 
  ``If permitted, decompilation would allow a second-comer to 
undercut sales of the original program without making the 
corresponding R&amp;D investment,'' Marshall Phelps, an IBM vice 
president, told the committee last week. 
  Timothy Langley, director of government affairs at Apple 
Japan Ltd., claimed the opponents ``represent the major voices 
in the U.S. information industry.'' The 13 original companies in 
the group, since joined by more than 20 others, chalked up 
revenues of $14 billion in Japan in 1992, he said. 
  The U.S. government has strongly supported this group, with 
a 
senior U.S. trade official describing the possible weakening of 
Japan's software protection as ``an issue of the gravest 
concern.'' 
  The official said the U.S. government ``must also consider 
and protect the totality of U.S. economic interests,'' noting 
the risk to intellectual property rights extends beyond software 
to other industries. 
  It is unclear whether the fissure in the U.S. side will 
influence the advisory committee to recommend that the 
government proceed with amending the copyright law. Committee 
officials said last week that they will continue to study the 
issue but have taken no position yet. A report will be filed 
after February, one official said. 
  Seeking to assure the other U.S. firms, Peter Choy, Sun 
Microsystems' deputy general counsel and ACIS chairman, said his 
group ``would not support any change that would make it easier 
for companies to engage in piracy'' of computer programs. If 
Japanese law were ``clarified to permit reverse engineering, 
including decompilation, for legitimate purposes,'' he said, 
``we are confident it would not foster piracy.''

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) is working in closer cooperation with the Ministry of 
Construction (MOC), the Ministry of Transport (MOT), the 
Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and the Environment Agency (EA) 
to promote practical applications of new energy including 
photovoltaic power generation and clean energy vehicles. They 
are aiming at a joint strategy by proposing a low-interest loan 
system to promote commercialization of clean energy vehicles 
such as compressed natural gas (CNG) cars, while investigating 
how various laws can be applied. Usually, ministries fight over 
policies and budget proposals, but on energy issues they are 
keeping inter-ministerial conflict in hand. 
  Cooperative efforts by MITI with other ministries include 
the 
joint development project on housing models and residential 
subdivisions which incorporates natural energy such as 
photovoltaic power generation in order to cope with 
environmental problems. Measures for energy-efficient facilities 
and demonstration of photovoltaic power generation systems which 
had been promoted under the leadership of MITI, and housing 
construction incorporating energy conservation measures 
heretofore promoted by the MOC will be worked out jointly. 
  A committee of housing manufacturers within the Solar System 
Promotion Association has been investigating use of integrated 
roofing systems. In this area also a special committee under the 
guidance of MOC has given special attention to the applicability 
of laws related to construction. Furthermore, they will 
cooperate with MOC on architectural standardization regulations 
in order to use integrated modules for building materials. 
  This cooperation extends to clean energy vehicle 
development. 
The results of the CNG car fleet tests conducted by MITI will be 
checked by MOT's Safety Standard Investigation Committee. Both 
MITI and MOT have held five conferences on low pollution 
vehicles since last fiscal year. At these meetings they have 
prepared basic information on the development of CNG, electric, 
and methanol vehicles and related infrastructure, and the 
outlook for commercialization. 
  MITI and MOT are making special efforts to cooperate in 
development of systems to aid the commercialization of CNG 
vehicles. They are also cooperating on a joint proposal for a 
low interest loan system for CNG, electric, and methanol 
vehicles. Furthermore, they are making proposals jointly with EA 
to have CNG, electric, methanol and hybrid vehicles included in 
the new tax system. 
  In addition, MHA is currently holding an ``Investigative 
Research Forum for the Promotion of Local Energy Operation'' to 
discuss power generation using waste materials, refuse 
solidification for fuel/power generation, and wind power 
generation. MITI is also showing great interest in this area by 
exchanging information frequently through their divisions 
involved.

  [Text] The Federation of Electric Power Companies (Kohei 
Abe, chairman) will establish a Washington, D.C., office as 
early as this fall. The decision was made at the 21 July meeting 
of the chairmen of the nine electric power companies. Along with 
gathering information on such issues as U.S. atomic power and 
environmental policies, the office will also actively generate 
news on Japan's energy situation. Tokyo Electric Power Company 
and other utilities have overseas offices, but this will be the 
federation's first overseas office.

  [Text] Crumple a sheet of aluminum foil and then heat it 
up. Nothing changes. Now do the same thing with a sheet formed 
from a shape-memory alloy. The crumpled mass unfolds into a 
sheet again. 
  Shape-memory alloys are among the most fascinating of new 
materials for this unique ability to return to their original 
shape when heated, no matter how badly they have been distorted 
at a lower temperature. 
  Until recently, speculation on their potential raced far 
ahead of actual applications. But the alloys are now finding 
widening use in a broad range of fields, from consumer 
electronics to women's clothing to dental prosthetics. 
  Shape-memory alloys are one class of intermetallic 
compounds, 
a special group of two-metal alloys. What makes them unique is 
their molecular structure. When a typical metal is heated or 
cooled, bonding between atoms changes. But in a shape-memory 
alloy, the bonds between adjacent atoms remain very strong. 
  As a result, the material is very elastic and although it 
can 
be deformed below a certain temperature, it returns to its 
original shape when reheated. 
  These two unique properties of shape-memory alloys are being 
utilized in a variety of applications. In England, a 
shape-memory alloy has been used as the hinges for greenhouse 
windows. When the outdoor air reaches a certain temperature, the 
hinges change shape, opening the window in the process. 
<H5>  Storage Applications </H5>
  In Japan, shape-memory alloys are being used to help keep 
the 
air dry inside storage units holding chemicals, camera lenses 
and other moisture-sensitive products. A shape-memory alloy is 
used for the spring which controls a door separating the storage 
room from the unit containing the moisture-absorbing desiccant. 
When the desiccant can no longer absorb moisture, a heater 
kicks, triggering the spring to shut the door. With the storage 
area thus protected from exposure to moisture, the desiccant can 
be reconditioned. 
  Consumer-electronics manufacturers are using shape-memory 
alloys to give air conditioners added value. When the air 
conditioner is used to heat the room, a spring made from 
shape-memory alloy contracts, pulling the flaps down so the hot 
air is blown toward the floor. 
  The tremendous elasticity of shape-memory alloys has been 
used to make eyeglass frames and women's brassieres. 
  In the dental field, the alloys are being used for 
artificial-tooth roots. The branches of a tooth root made from a 
shape-memory alloy are straight when the dentist implants the 
root in the jaw bone, but bend when warmed by body temperature. 
As a result, the root becomes firmly secured and more difficult 
to dislodge. Shape-memory alloys are also being used for 
orthodontic braces. 
  The medical field is the site of much applications research. 
One day, shape-memory alloys may be employed to help mend broken 
bones by keeping the fractured parts firmly together. 
  Two types of shape-memory alloys are now in use: a 
nickel-titanium alloy, which accounts for 90&percnt; of all 
present 
applications, and a series of copper-based alloys, such as 
copper-zinc-aluminum. 
  Copper-based alloys are comparatively easy to process and 
therefore cheaper than nickel-titanium alloys, but they loose 
their ``memory'' after around 1,000 heating and cooling cycles. 
In contrast, a nickel-titanium alloy can last for as many as 1 
million cycles. 
  Moreover, this type of alloy does not corrode and is 
biocompatible, so it can be used inside the human body. The job 
now is to simplify the processing steps and to reduce production 
costs.

  [Text] On 1 June Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) 
announced that in cooperation with Hitachi, Ltd., it had 
developed a ceramic gas turbine blade. This blade has 
successfully completed high-temperature rotation tests based on 
models of gas turbines used in 20,000 kW output electric power 
generation where the turbine inlet temperature reaches 
1300&deg;C. There are 300 kW class ceramic gas turbines for use 
in automobile engines, and 300 kW ceramic gas turbines have been 
developed for cogeneration systems, but this is the first 20,000 
kW ceramic gas turbine blade for electric power generation that 
has ever been developed. 
  The turbine blades have the role of converting the energy of 
the gas flow to rotational energy. This jointly developed 
turbine blade is made of silicon nitride to withstand high 
temperatures, and it was designed with increased anti-stress 
properties to counteract the stress generated by centrifugal 
force. 
  Performance was confirmed in rotation tests at a Hitachi 
plant. Tests were conducted at a rated rotation of 11,214 rpm in 
air (air temperature approx. 200&deg;C) using kerosene as fuel. 
Researchers measured both the rotor shaft vibration and ceramic 
blade vibration, and found no problems. 
  High-temperature combustion tests were also conducted. 
Researchers found no abnormalities whatsoever when they 
inspected the ceramic blades after a 2-hour test at 1,200&deg;C 
at the rated rpm, a 4-hour normal operation test at 1,300&deg;C, 
a normal shutdown test, and a fuel cutoff/emergency shutdown 
test. 
  Tokyo Electric Power is working to increase its thermal 
efficiency more than 50&percnt; via combined cycle power 
generation 
that uses both gas and steam turbines. Since 1984 TEPCO has 
proceeded with development of a gas turbine for power generation 
made of ceramic material, which can withstand high temperatures. 
As part of this program in January 1990 TEPCO developed a 
ceramic gas turbine combustor jointly with Toshiba, and in 
November of the same year developed a ceramic stator blade for 
expanding gas and converting pressure energy to dynamic energy 
jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. 
  This ceramic blade is a continuation of that program, and 
its 
development confirms that less cooling air will be needed than 
with the current metal blades, and that researchers can now aim 
for greater combustion efficiency.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) will begin a study on ways for Japanese plastic 
processing companies to provide investment capital and technical 
guidance in a smooth manner for the expansion of the plastic 
processing industry in Asia, acting mainly through ASEAN. The 
plastic processing industry has many small and mid-sized 
companies, and business expansion on a global scale has lagged 
behind other industries. In addition to its current measures to 
combat the high value of the yen, MITI has decided that healthy 
business growth will be impossible without expansion in Asia, 
which is a site of potential growth. Furthermore, various 
countries in Asia are looking to Japanese industry to raise the 
level of their plastic processing technology and train their 
personnel, so mutual exchanges of personnel are on the rise. 
  In addition to ROK and Taiwan, the petrochemical industry is 
expanding rapidly in Southeast Asian countries such as 
Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. At the same time, 
in these countries the plastic processing industry is expanding 
as well in step with the rapid growth in assembly industries 
such as the electric/electronics industry and a higher standard 
of living. According to MITI, Thailand alone has about 3000 
plastic processing companies. 
  The fact is, however, that international expansion by 
Japanese plastic processing companies has lagged behind other 
industries. MITI contends that we cannot expect future growth in 
this industry without expansion in Southeast Asia, which is 
becoming a major consumer site. Therefore, MITI will begin a 
study to allow for Japanese companies to make capital 
investments and provide technical training in Asia in a smooth 
manner, and also to raise the level of technology in the region 
and cooperate in personnel training. 
  MITI plans to conduct this study through the Japan High 
Polymer Center, a non-profit corporation with experience in 
overseas technical cooperation such as a plastic processing 
testing and inspection project in Uruguay and a water-retaining 
materials project in Egypt. 
  MITI plans to begin a new policy of global expansion through 
mutual exchanges of personnel with Asia, which continues to grow 
rapidly not only as an export base to the U.S. and Europe, but 
also as a huge consumer market. The New Fiber Vision, for which 
an interim report was recently released, also proposes the 
establishment of a new global strategy centered on Asia. In the 
petrochemical industry as well, a Southeast Asia study group 
will be dispatched by the International Supply &amp; Demand 
Subcommittee of the Petrochemical Product Supply &amp; Demand 
Research Institute. All this will add impetus to expansion in 
Asia in fields related to the chemical industry.

  [Text] The Japan Technology Transfer Association (JTTAS) 
will establish a research committee for industry/academic 
exchange on ultrafine particles. The committee will focus on the 
special properties of nanometer-sized fine particles and seek 
potential uses for them in industry. The committee is expected 
to begin in October after enrolling participating companies, and 
it will hold regular research conferences. 
  JTTAS will house the business office of the ``Nanostructure 
Materials Function and Use Research Committee,'' which will have 
professor Yuichiro Nishina, Metal Materials Research Laboratory, 
Tohoku University, as its chair and have a coordinating 
committee comprised of researchers from academia, government, 
and industry including Tokyo University, Kyushu University, 
Tsukuba University, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Keio 
University, AIST and private corporations. 
  In ultrafine particles, whose dimensions are measured in 
nanometers, a higher ratio of atoms and molecules comprise the 
surface than with conventional particles, so even a slight 
change in the number of atoms or molecules causes a major change 
in the physical and chemical properties of the particles. 
Research in this field has attracted growing attention in recent 
years. For example, it has been selected by the Ministry of 
Education as a basic research program, and AIST has also 
launched a project for establishing techniques to manipulate 
individual atoms and molecules. The new research committee will 
promote information exchange between industry and academia with 
the goal of developing new materials using ultrafine particles. 
  As a prelude, the committee will hold a public seminar (free 
of charge) in Tokyo to enroll participating companies on 7 July. 
JTTAS is a non-profit corporation under the auspices of AIST, 
and it works to promote exchange between industry and academia 
and helps find human resources for various topics in technology. 
Inquires may be directed to the business office (03-3597-8200).

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) will initiate comprehensive technical development of new 
diamond materials, which are expected to find applications in 
electronic devices that operate under extreme conditions imposed 
by global environmental problems [sic]. MITI will establish a 
joint research system for national research institutes and 
private companies, begin work on the creation of carbon and 
carbon-containing (new diamond) materials and on development of 
their basic manufacturing technology, and even get involved in 
the control of their properties and their evaluation. MITI will 
also work on development of basic technology for their use as 
threshold electronics materials. More specifically, beginning in 
1994 MITI will seek out the possibilities of creating a variety 
of carbon materials using AIST's advanced research system and 
plans to promote it as a national project by 1996. 
  The use of diamonds has expanded dramatically with the 
advent 
of gas phase synthesis technology. Not only in the field of wear 
resistance, which utilizes the hardness properties of diamonds, 
but also in the fields of electronics and optics the uses of 
diamonds have expanded rapidly, and already researchers have 
created primitive transistors and several passive devices. 
  On the other hand, the group of substances that have carbon 
as their main component include a variety of forms such as DLC 
(diamond lattice carbon films), fullerenes (C&lt;inf&gt; 60&lt;/inf&gt; ), 
carbon tubes and carbenes. Moreover, their crystal structures 
can be linear, planar, three-dimensional or amorphous. In 
addition to SiC and B&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; C, we can also expect still 
unknown carbon compounds such as C&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; N&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; 
and BCN to appear. It is projected that these new diamonds will 
become a one trillion yen market in the 21st century. 
  In order to promote the sophisticated use of these carbon 
and 
carbon-containing compounds, the policy toward new diamonds 
planned by MITI involves R&amp;D on a large scale from basic to 
applied research including development of basic materials and 
the techniques to manufacture them, development of technology to 
control their crystalline and electronic properties, and 
development of applications focusing on electronic materials. 
  First MITI plans to establish a system for joint R&amp;D by 
private corporations and university experts anchored by national 
research institutes and then conduct advanced research for one 
or two years. 
  The following specific themes have been proposed: 
  1. Research on basic technology to create new substances 
  2. Research on basic techniques for growing crystals 
  3. Study of basic techniques to control electronic structure 
  4. Research concerning applied technology. 
  New diamonds are attracting attention as possible electronic 
devices that can be used under extreme environmental conditions. 
Active research is being carried out in Japan, the U.S. and 
European Community. MITI's commitment to new diamond technology 
will surely encourage further R&amp;D in the industry.

  [Text] Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. has developed 
SAT64AW, a titanium alloy that dramatically increases wear 
resistance, and has begun a full-fledged effort to develop 
commercial demand. The new titanium alloy is called a 
carbide-diffused, wear-resistant titanium alloy. It has titanium 
carbide as an additive, and the TiC forms fine crystals in the 
&bgr; matrix phase, which greatly increases wear resistance. One 
drawback of titanium alloys has been their poor wear resistance. 
With this new titanium alloy, however, Sumitomo hopes to extend 
their usage to automobile engine parts, sea water pump parts, 
sliding parts, etc. Therefore, Sumitomo will aggressively strive 
to develop new demands for this product. 
  This new wear-resistant alloy developed by Sumitomo has 
titanium carbide added to the common titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, 
an alloy with 6&percnt; aluminum and 4&percnt; vanadium added to 
the 
titanium. When titanium carbide is added, the titanium alloy 
matrix changes from the &agr;-&bgr; phase to the &bgr; phase, 
which is 
tougher. In addition, the TiC is finely dispersed and forms a 
fine crystal structure, so the alloy not only has excellent 
strength, but also greatly increased wear resistance. In terms 
of wear resistance, Ti-6Al-V4 is not even worthy of comparison, 
for the wear resistance of the new alloy equals that of Stellite 
No. 6 (a nickel-chrome-cobalt alloy), an alloy with excellent 
properties. When we consider the mechanical properties as well, 
such as the fact that Stellite has poor ductility, it is clear 
that this new alloy can also be used as structural component. 
  Titanium alloys are known for their high strength, light 
weight and excellent corrosion resistance, but they have 
drawbacks such as a Young's modulus only half that of steel 
materials, obviously poorer wear resistance, and poorer cutting 
properties. Therefore, countermeasures to overcome this poor 
wear resistance, such as forming a wear-resistant surface layer 
with molten molybdenum, have been tried. However, many problems 
remain to be solved such as the thickness of the overlay, and so 
there has been great demand for the development of a 
wear-resistant titanium alloy. 
  Sumitomo Metal believes that SAT64AW will answer the demand 
for wear resistance, and plans to develop new applications for 
it such as automobile engine parts, solid cast titanium valves, 
etc. In terms of cutting properties, Sumitomo has also developed 
smooth-cutting titanium alloys by adding 0.2&percnt; nickel and 
0.2-0.6&percnt; mesh metal to Ti-6Al-4V and to Ti-3Al-2.5V, 
which is 
an alloy with the lower amounts of 3&percnt; aluminum and 
2.5&percnt; 
vanadium added to the titanium. Together with its wear-resistant 
alloy, Sumitomo hopes to expand use of these alloys to 
automobile engines and machine parts.

  [Text] The Government Industrial Research Institute, 
Nagoya, has developed process technology in which a 
titanium-aluminum powder is injection-molded and sintered. This 
development is based on the development project entitled ``Super 
Environmentally Resistant Advanced Materials'' under MITI's Next 
Generation Industrial Basic Technology R&amp;D System. It is a 
technique for freely deforming and processing intermetallic 
compounds, which are notoriously hard to process, into complex 
shapes. GIRI, Nagoya, established this technology in a series of 
manufacturing steps by first using an injection molding machine 
to mold commercial titanium-aluminum powder and then sintering 
it in a vacuum furnace. GIRI, Nagoya, plans to develop new 
materials in the future with this process. 
  The Super Environmentally Resistant Advanced Materials 
Project is an eight-year project running from 1989 to 1996, and 
development proceeds through an industry-academia-government 
joint structure. The intermetallic compounds targeted for 
development are strong at high temperatures such as 
titanium-aluminum (1100&deg;C), niobium-aluminum (1800&deg;C) 
and the like. Their applications are likely to include 
aeronautics and space, such as the super plane that is expected 
to appear in the 21st Century, new forms of energy, etc. GIRI, 
Nagoya, conducted its R&amp;D on injection molding and metallurgy 
with powders of intermetallic compounds based on the injection 
molding process for ceramics that it developed from 1981 through 
1988. 
  This new process consists bringing together commercially 
available titanium-aluminum powder, an injection molding machine 
used for plastics, and a vacuum furnace. Researchers mixed wax 
and resin as binders with the powdered alloy at 150&deg;C, 
formed pellets, injection molded, removed the binder by 
evaporation, and sintered the product in a vacuum furnace. 
Injection molding of metal powders has been performed with 
stainless steel for use as parts in watches, etc., but this is 
the first time it has been accomplished with an intermetallic 
compound. 
  Because the main goal of this project is not development of 
new materials, the sample pieces do have good material 
properties, but the fact that this manufacturing process enables 
titanium-aluminum injection molding is a major step forward. 
Researchers plan to continue studies from the standpoint of 
material properties by adding strengthening elements, etc., in 
the future. The features of this injection molding/sintering 
process are that the work environment is good, material losses 
are small, complex shapes are possible, etc. It is attracting 
attention as a new method to be used in place of precision 
casting.

  [Text] About forty years ago, an ingenious contraption 
nicknamed ``the flying bedstead'' took to the air at a Rolls 
Royce test facility in the United Kingdom. The name was an apt 
description of an ungainly flying machine heralded as a 
breakthrough in aviation. What made the craft unusual was that 
it could take off and land vertically using downward-facing jet 
nozzles at its four corners. Once aloft, the nozzles could 
rotate to propel it forward. 
  The flying bedstead was the prototype for vertical takeoff 
and landing (VTOL) jet aircraft. The appeal of VTOLs was that 
they would not need runways; theoretically, they could take off 
and land in city centers but fly like conventional jets once 
airborne, carrying the same loads at the same speeds. 



  Over the next 20 years, about thirty different VTOL designs 
were developed and tested. Some used jet engines, while others 
used rotors that could swivel from a horizontal position for 
lift to the vertical for flight. Nearly all the test flights 
ended in disaster. Only one design found practical use--the 
Harrier jump-jet fighter used by the Royal Air Force and the 
U.S. Navy. 
  Not surprisingly, most VTOLs came to grief at takeoff or 
landing, the moments of greatest risk for any aircraft. In a 
normal jet aircraft, aerodynamic lift provided by the wings 
gives a degree of stability as a plane takes off or cruises to 
land. In a VTOL, this type of lift is nonexistent: only the 
vertical thrust from the jets keeps the plane aloft and at the 
correct attitude. The problems lie largely in finely controlling 
the blasts from the downward-facing jets. Even slight gusts of 
wind or variations in thrust from the engines could unbalance 
the craft as it sat on ``pillars'' of air. When this happened, 
the pilot had only seconds to restore the jet's equilibrium 
before crashing. 
  Technological strides over the last two decades have changed 
the outlook for VTOLs, which now might begin to fulfill their 
original promise and meet modern safety standards for civil 
aviation. VTOLs are being reexamined in several countries, 
including several European nations and the United States. In 
Japan, a revolutionary VTOL design from the National Aerospace 
Laboratory (NAL) is now ready for implementation. 
  Progress in three key areas of technology has given VTOLs 
their second chance, according to Dr. Masanori Endoh, who leads 
the NAL team. ``Microelectronics now allow us to incorporate 
very sophisticatedcontrols into the designs, something that 
wasn't possible until recently,'' he explained. ``The 
development of very lightweight composite materials also helps. 
Since a VTOL takes off using engine thrust and not aerodynamic 
wing lift, it is essential for the plane to be as light as 
possible.'' The kinds of materials he is referring to include 
both lightweight, carbon-reinforced plastics and new types of 
ceramics. 
  The third advance is the development of new kinds of 
engines. 
``VTOLs of the fifties were extremely noisy,'' says Dr. Endoh. 
``This alone would be a fatal defect today, because no one would 
tolerate such noisy jets at civilian airports, let alone in city 
centers.'' Dr. Endoh's team has designed a new engine that is 
high-powered, lightweight, and creates no more noise than a 
light helicopter. The new engine is the key innovation in NAL's 
new VTOL design. 
  The aircraft would fly using a unique system of lift and 
cruise fans powered by a trio of rear-mounted jet turbines. 
High-pressure air from these three engines would be piped to 
twin seven-foot cruise fans. At the center of each fan, a 
combustor would ignite a mixture of high-pressure air and fuel. 
The expanding gases would spin a turbine linked to the fan, 
producing 24,000 pounds of thrust a side. 
  During vertical takeoff and landing, high-pressure air would 
be channeled to three eight-foot, 200-blade, one-piece rotors 
that are encased within each wing and shielded by movable 
shutters. Collectively, the six rotors, with their own 
combustors, would generate over 130,000 pounds of thrust. 
  Surprisingly, the lift fans are not noisy. ``Because of 
their 
size their rotation speed is very low, which reduces the 
noise,'' says Endoh. ``The one-piece design also means that the 
sound the fans produce is higher-pitched than in regular rotors, 
where the blades are individually fitted. Our aircraft will be 
quieter than a conventional helicopter!'' 
  As the craft rises, the pilot gradually redirects the 
high-pressure air from the lift to the cruise fans, 
simultaneously closing the shutters in the wings. This increases 
the wings' effective surface area, boosting the aerodynamic 
lift. Should one or more of the lift fans cease working, the 
plane should remain stable as long as at least one fan on each 
side functions. Should all fail, the plane can still land on a 
runway like a conventional airliner. 
  NAL's aircraft isn't on the tarmac just yet. Engine tests 
are 
due this year, but the pace of progress will depend on new 
government funding. Computer simulations and wind-tunnel tests 
using models indicate the plane will fulfill the designer's 
expectations. In Dr. Endoh's most optimistic scenario, the first 
test flights could be taking place around the end of the decade, 
and commercial flights could start early in the next century. If 
all goes well, the new VTOL could then be ferrying over a 
hundred commuters a trip to and from city centers, taking off 
and landing at ``vertports'' no bigger than 200 square meters. 
  Dr. Endoh calculates ticket prices on his VTOL would be 
about 
30 percent higher than on a conventional airliner. He doesn't 
think this will prove a problem, since passengers will save the 
time and expense of lengthy journeys to out-of-town airports. 
``In the past, people have been willing to pay more for easier 
and swifter journeys. The extra cost of traveling by bullet 
train compared with regular trains has not deterred travelers, 
and I think the same will prove true for VTOLs,'' he explains. 
  For urban planners, the VTOL could also prove a boon. The 
small size of vertports makes them easy and inexpensive to 
build. Any city center tract of land, or even the space over 
rail tracks, could be utilized.New vertports could go from the 
planning stage to operational status within a year--very fast 
when compared with the decades it takes to plan and build 
costlier conventional airports. According to Dr. Endoh, VTOLs 
should be ready to put the problems of civil aviation to bed, 
about fifty years after that first flying bedstead took to the 
air.

  [Text] Progress is being made in the international project 
to develop a Mach-5 engine for a supersonic plane capable of 
covering the distance between Tokyo and New York in three hours, 
reports MITI's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, 
which is orchestrating the effort. 
  The Mach-5 engine is being developed as a joint effort by 
aerospace engine makers from Japan, the U.S., Britain and 
France. The design calls for an engine which combines a 
turbojet, like those used on conventional subsonic aircraft, 
with a ramjet, like those used on missiles. The turbojet would 
accelerate the aircraft up to Mach-3, after which the ramjet 
would kick in. 
  A one-third scale model of the turbojet part of the engine 
has been constructed which is capable of withstanding 
temperatures of 1,600 C--a temperature at which conventional 
engines melt. To achieve this high heat resistance, the engine 
blades were made from a special nickel alloy and a more 
effective air-cooling system was designed. 
  This model was then loaded with fuel and fired up for the 
first time to verify the engine's power characteristics and its 
ability to withstand shaking. The tests were carried out on 15 
November at a plant operated by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy 
Industries Co. 
  The small-scale model engine did not reach an internal 
temperature of 1,600 C during the tests, but the international 
research group does not plan to test the heat-resistant 
characteristics of the engine until fiscal 1995. The goal is to 
develop a practical Mach-5 engine by the year 2020.

  [Text] Twelve years, billions of yen, and untold hours of 
anguish alter, the Japanese government is pulling the plug on 
its support of a controversial Boeing Co. project to develop a 
midsized passenger plane, known both as the 7J7 and the YXX. 
  The giant U.S. aircraft maker has not officially nixed the 
project itself, but it is believed that the program will wilt in 
light of Boeing's recent decision to simply remodel its 737 into 
a successor known as the 737X, according to Japanese sources. 
  The Japanese view that it had little choice but to bow out 
underscores how tightly this nation's aircraft industry has tied 
its fate to Boeing. Even as the YXX program fades away, new 
projects are on the horizon for Japan, but all of them in one 
way or another depend on Boeing's moves. 
  The relationship dates back decades, but a key turning point 
was in 1981, when Boeing planners envisioned that the follow-on 
to their highly successful 737 would be the 150-seat 7J7, known 
in Japan as the YXX. 
  In a move that brought howls from U.S. critics who claimed 
Boeing was giving away America's key technologies on a silver 
platter, the firm turned to Japan for 25&percnt; of the 
investment 
dollars and a piece of the development and manufacturing 
responsibilities. 
  Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
regarded 
the YXX project as an important step toward the eventual goal of 
a Japanese-developed passenger aircraft. 
  Several Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., and Fuji 
Heavy Industries, Ltd., have spent more than a decade 
researching and developing aspects of the YXX. 
  MITI recently revealed it has decided to suspend the YXX 
project next fiscal year, beginning in April. Bureaucrats have 
reduced the proposed spending for the YXX project in the 1994 
fiscal year budget to an amount needed simply to pull loose ends 
together. 
  For the post-737 aircraft, Boeing has decided to modify its 
existing 737, in order to save on development costs. The 737 is 
the world's best-selling passenger aircraft, with total orders 
of more than 3,000. 
  MITI officials concluded that, in light of Boeing's plans 
for 
the 737X, a YXX wouldn't be competitive. 
  Industry sources said Boeing and Japan have reached a basic 
agreement on Japanese participation in the new 737X project. 
Boeing has proposed to limit Japan's share to wing-related 
parts, the sources added, becausethere will be only limited 
modifications to the 737 aircraft. 
  Most parts and components of the 737 have been manufactured 
within the U.S. and will continue to be. Given that Boeing is 
implementing drastic streamlining measures, including slashing 
employees, offering jobs to Japan is quite unlikely, Japanese 
officials said. 
  In addition, the appreciation of the yen and relatively 
expensive labor cots would make Japanese parts costly for 
Boeing, they added. 
  On the other hand, Korea announced recently that it would 
take part in the 737X project. Japanese officials also suspect 
that China would join the project. 
  Earlier 1993, Japan's major aircraft builders started 
shipping components for Boeing's new 777 passenger plane. The 
industry hopes such shipments will help offset business lost 
because of declining Japanese defense spending. 
  While the decline of the YXX project is a setback for 
Japan's 
hopes to invigorate its aerospace industry, MITI has another 
plan in the works. 
  The budget is expected to balloon next year for another 
proposed aircraft, the 75-seat YSX regional jet. 
  This time the project is being led by a private Japanese 
consortium, heavily backed by the government, which is hoping to 
attract other nations. Officials would especially like to lure 
China into the project since that nation's 21st-century appetite 
for regional jets is expected to be huge. 
  It also is said in Japanese circles that the tables are 
being 
turned on the U.S. It is Boeing, according to industry sources, 
that is knocking on Japan's door in hopes of getting a piece of 
the project.

  [Text] In order to optimize growth conditions of gallium 
arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP), their crystals were 
grown on the earth. The grown GaAs was etched to realize an 
initial interface shape. Dopant distribution was measured by 
imaging infrared light transmission. Hall mobility was obtained 
by the Hall measurement. The temperature dependence of thickness 
of the InP single-crystal growth-layer was experimentally and 
numerically determined. Temperature effect on etch-pit density 
was examined. Striations and the shape of the initial interface 
were observed by etching the (211) plane. Photo-luminescence was 
measured for determination of dopant distribution. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the 
Ministry of Education (MOE), and the Science and Technology 
Agency (STA) are planning to jointly launch an artificial 
satellite in February 1995 called the Space Flyer Unit 
(SFU)&lt;sup&gt; (1,2)&lt;/sup&gt;  which will be lifted aboard an H-II 
rocket now in development. As for the role of MITI, it is 
getting the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO) and the 
Unmanned Space Experimentation Foundation (USEF) to line up 
various companies to perform space experiments associated with 
compound semiconductors. At this point, they have lined up seven 
companies to perform eight experiments in the SFU mission (cf. 
Table 1). Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) will carry 
out two of the experiments.&lt;sup&gt; (3,4)&lt;/sup&gt;

    The Technology Research Institute of IHI is the main party 
taking part in these experiments from first proposing the 
experiments, which it did in 1987, to drafting and implementing 
the design of the experiments. The semiconductor materials to be 
studied in the space experiments include gallium arsenide (GaAs) 
and indium phosphide (InP) (cf. same table). The Bridgman 
technique, a melting method of growing crystal, will be the 
method used to grow GaAs crystal, and the THM technique, a type 
of solution growth method, will be used to grow the InP crystal. 
The main purpose of the GaAs crystal growth experiment is to 
obtain a crystal having a uniform concentration of impurities by 
conducting crystal growth under managed diffusion 
conditions.&lt;sup&gt; (3)&lt;/sup&gt;  The main purpose of the InP crystal 
growth experiment, meanwhile, is to investigate the effect that 
the convection generated in a solution has on the quality of 
crystal.&lt;sup&gt; (4)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  In order to achieve these goals, IHI has been conducting a 
battery of experiments on the ground for perfecting test 
conditions and evaluating crystal growth. The furnaces used for 
the ground experiments include an electric furnace, which 
belongs to IHI (hereinafter called IHI furnace), and a ground 
test furnace (hereinafter called ground furnace), which belongs 
to USEF, and which is identical to that to be carried aboard the 
artificial satellite. The IHI furnace has been mainly used to 
establish growth conditions and verify the safety of the space 
experiments, while the ground furnace has been mainly used to 
verify the furnace conditions satisfying the parameters of the 
experiments. In the future, the ground furnace will be used to 
obtain reference comparison crystal here in the gravity 
environment of earth. 
  In this paper, we report on the crystal growth experiments 
and the results obtained therein. 
<H5>  2. Test Equipment </H5>
  2.1 Gallium Arsenide 
  The growth of GaAs crystal is performed by the Bridgman 
method, which is a melting method of growing crystal in which 
molten material is unidirectionally solidified from seed 
crystal. An electric furnace called a complex heating furnace 
(GHF: gradient heating furnace) has been built specifically for 
this growth method. In the ground experiments, a GHF is used 
together with the IHI furnace and the ground furnace. In Figure 
1, we show a ground furnace having the same properties as the 
gradient heating furnace carried aboard the SFU.&lt;sup&gt; (2)&lt;/sup&gt; 
The ground furnace is made up of a high-temperature furnace and 
a low-temperature furnace. A cooling block has been placed 
between both furnaces to achieve a sharp temperature gradient. 



  A tantalum cartridge containing the growth material is 
inserted into the ground furnace. The outer diameter of the 
cartridge is 25, and the surface of the container is coated with 
aluminum in order to improve emissivity. Figure 1 shows a 
furnace in which the tantalum cartridge has been inserted in the 
starting position. 
  The sample ampule, which fits inside the tantalum cartridge, 
has a maximum diameter of 23.6 and a length of 220. Figure 2 is 
a diagram showing the configuration of the actual GaAs ampule 
which will be used up in space. The ampule basically has a 
three-fold structure.&lt;sup&gt; (3)&lt;/sup&gt;  The very inner part is a 
boron nitride crucible which holds the molten GaAs, and 
surrounding that is a quartz container that seals the crucible 
in a vacuum. The very outer part is a graphite containment 
vessel which protects the sealed container from expansion and 
deformation. Cushions have also been provided in certain 
locations to absorb the stress generated by the differences in 
the thermal expansion coefficient when the temperature drops. 



  The volume of GaAs or InP semiconductors with the 
zinc-blende 
crystal structure is reduced by about 10&percnt; when melted. In 
order 
to absorb this loss of volume and have the GaAs solution 
maintain continuous contact with the wall of the crucible, a 
graphite spring has been installed inside the crucible. 
  2.2 Indium Phosphide 
  The growth of InP crystal is performed by the THM method. 
The 
THM method is a method of growing crystal on the seed crystal 
side in which a solution band sandwiched between the seed 
crystal and raw material polycrystal is locally heated, and in 
which the solution band shifts toward the polycrystal by the 
movement of the furnace or ampule. An electric furnace similar 
to a mirror heating furnace (MHF), which is able to perform 
local heating, has been designed specifically for this growth 
method. A MHF is also used together with the IHI furnace and the 
ground furnace in the experiments. In Figure 3, we show the 
configuration of a ground furnace having the same properties as 
the mirror heating furnace to be carried aboard the 
SFU.&lt;sup&gt; (2)&lt;/sup&gt;  The mirror heating furnace is an electric 
furnace that uses a single elliptical mirror to focus infrared 
radiation and heat the sample material. At one of the focusing 
points in the MHF, a halogen lamp has been installed to act as 
an infrared radiation source, and at the other focusing point is 
the sample ampule, which has a maximum diameter of 30 and a 
length of 120. 



  In Figure 4, we show the structure of the InP ampule to be 
used in space. Following the direction in which the sample 
material moves, the ampule is made up of a vacuum sealed area, a 
cushion, raw material polycrystal, a solution band, InP 
monocrystal, a graphite rod, a cushion, and a vacuum sealed 
area. Indium is the material used for the solution band. In 
solution growth, the temperature of the solid-liquid interface 
on the raw material polycrystal side has to be higher than the 
temperature of the growing solid-liquid interface on the seed 
crystal side. That temperature difference is the driving force 
which causes the raw material to dissolve in the solution band, 
and causes the indium phosphide to be deposited on the seed 
crystal. The temperature gradient of the seed crystal growth 
interface is also what determines the length and quality of seed 
crystal growth. In this ampule, the temperature gradient of the 
growth interface on the seed crystal side is controlled by 
graphite rods positioned adjacent to the seed 
crystal.&lt;sup&gt; (5)&lt;/sup&gt; 



  Cushions have been installed in order to absorb the stress 
caused by the thermal expansion of the graphite and indium 
phosphide. Indium, unlike indium phosphide, gains more volume 
when molten than as a solid. For that reason, the seed crystal 
is precisely inserted into quartz tubes so that the molten 
indium does not find a way around the seed crystal when being 
dissolved. 
<H5>  3. Test Results and Studies </H5>
  3.1 Gallium Arsenide 
  When gallium arsenide is melted, it produces an arsenide 
(As) 
saturated vapor pressure of about one atmosphere. Because 
arsenide and arsenide compounds are toxic substances, arsenide 
steam cannot be discharged into the air. With that in mind, we 
decided to conduct a GaAs crystal growth experiment using the 
IHI furnace to verify the safety of the ampule. In Figure 5, we 
show the extracted ampule after completing the crystal growth 
experiment in the IHI furnace. In the upper part, we can see the 
graphite containment vessel, and in the lower part, the 
vacuum-sealed quartz container. A boron nitride crucible has 
been sealed within the quartz container. It is apparent from 
looking at the ampule that there has been some devitrification 
on the surface of the sealed container but no damage to the 
components that make up the ampule including the containment 
vessel, sealed container, and crucible. 



  After verifying the safety of the ampule in the IHI furnace, 
we conducted a crystal growth experiment in the ground furnace 
with an identical ampule. The ultimate aim was to conduct the 
experiment in a weightless environment identical to that found 
in space, and obtain a reference crystal that can be used for 
comparison purposes. In Figure 6, we show the ground furnace in 
operation. 



  In Figure 7, we show a GaAs sample after the crystal growth 
experiment. The growth plane is the (111) B plane. The metallic 
shiny part on the left side of the picture is the seed crystal, 
and the slightly more shiny area on the right is the growth 
portion. Also, the place where both these meet is the initial 
solid-liquid interface. We cut along the (110) plane in the 
direction of crystal growth and evaluated the shape of the 
initial solid-liquid interface by etching the crystal after 
pretreating. The etching liquid used was a solution of chromium 
oxide and silver nitrate called AB etchant, and the solvent was 
hydrofluoric acid and water. 



  In Figure 8, we show a longitudinal microphotograph taken 
after etching. The curved line on the right side of the 
photograph is the initial solid-liquid interface. Crystal growth 
starts from the initial solid-liquid interface, and proceeds 
toward the left. The shape of the solid-liquid interface is 
convex, so we believe solidification is taking place from the 
wall of the crucible during crystal growth. This agrees quite 
well with the direction of intercrystal growth. In the future, 
additional improvements will have to made to the ampule material 
and dimensions so as to make the shape of the solid-liquid 
interface convex on the molten side. It is clear by looking at 
the photograph, however, that the shape of the solid-liquid 
interface on the seed side is convex, but from the location of 
the initial solid-liquid interface, the monocrystal obtained 
measures about 2 at the shortest point and about 9 at the 
longest. This length represents approximately 16&percnt; and 
60&percnt;, 
respectively, of the crystal growth. 



  We measured the distribution of dopant concentration in the 
sample by the infrared transmission method, which is one of the 
methods used to evaluate optical characteristics. The results of 
those measurements are shown in Figure 9. The bright arc-shaped 
border is the initial solid-liquid interface. Measurements 
indicate that the more transmitted light, the less dopant 
concentration. Accordingly, as we can see from the image, dopant 
concentration steadily rises as the crystal grows. This fact 
agrees quite well with what we have seen in crystal growth on 
the ground under managed thermal convection in which the dopant 
concentration shows a tendency to steadily rise. 



  Hall measurements were taken to evaluate electrical 
characteristics. In Figure 10, we show the changes in Hall 
mobility along the direction of growth. This is the etch-pit 
density in which the thin lines indicate mobility and the fat 
lines indicate crystal fault density. It is clear from looking 
at the drawing that we have achieved the same mobility as seed 
crystal right from the time that crystal growth started. We were 
also able to confirm that when growth advances, mobility 
decreases as etch-pit density rises. 



  3.2 Indium Phosphide 
  In Figure 11, we show a picture of the sample ampule used 
for 
the ground experiments. The ampule that will be used in the 
space experiments will have almost the same configuration. The 
metallic shiny area is the indium solution band. This is the 
part where infrared radiation is condensed from the mirror 
heating furnace. The growth plane is the (111) B plane. Heating 
was conducted in a maximum temperature range between 880&deg;C 
and 1000&deg;C. The furnace traveled at 0.05 to 0.2/h. Also, 
because it is a single-mirror heating furnace, the ampule is 
rotated at 5 rpm to improve the circumferential temperature 
distribution at the growth interface. 



  In Figure 12, we show the relationship between length and 
maximum temperature in monocrystal growth. The white circles 
indicate the areas tested. The diagram clearly shows that as 
maximum temperature drops from 1000&deg;C to 900&deg;C the 
length of monocrystal growth grows and reaches a length of about 
2. 2 is too large for InP crystal growth that belongs to the 
category of so-called liquid-phase epitaxial growth. We think 
the optimum temperature for crystal growth is between 880&deg;C 
and 900&deg;C. The solid line in the drawing is found by 
calculating the solution band flow, the P concentration 
distribution, and the temperature distribution in an IG 
environment. This is done to make it easier to estimate 
constitutional cooling (C/C&lt;inf&gt; sat&lt;/inf&gt; ).&lt;sup&gt; (4)&lt;/sup&gt; 
Constitutional cooling is a yardstick of polycrystallization, 
which means that the smaller the constitutional cooling, the 
easier it is obtain crystal. As the temperature drops to 
900&deg;C, the yardstick decreases and remains almost constantly 
below 900&deg;C. This agrees quite well with the test results. 
In the space experiments also, we believe that studying 
constitutional cooling will be an effective tool with which to 
make comparisons. 



  In Figure 13, we show the temperature dependency of etch-bit 
density (EPD), which is an indicator of crystal quality. It 
clearly shows that the bigger the drop in maximum temperature 
the smaller the EDP and the better the crystal quality. It also 
demonstrates that zinc dopants are more effective in reducing 
dislocation. Figure 14 is a photograph showing the growth region 
cut along the (211) plane in the direction of growth, and 
treated with AB etchant. The streak seen in the unevenness of 
the growth region is called an impurity band, and from it flow 
data can be obtained. It is our belief that this impurity band 
is more easily shaped on the ground than in space. 







    We measured photo-luminescence by a method which evaluated 
the optical characteristics. In Figure 15, we show the peak 
half-width mapping results from the growth crystal (111) plane. 
The yellow region in the center indicates high zinc dopant 
concentration, the surrounding blue area shows very little 
dopant concentration. The shape of the growth interface is 
indicative of a protruding shape. 



  There are two kinds of InP etch-pits, namely, the D-pit, 
which is associated with dislocation, and the 
S-pit,&lt;sup&gt; (6)&lt;/sup&gt;  which is assumed to be associated with 
impurity concentration. In Figure 16, we show the relationship 
between photo-luminescence intensity and S-pit density. We can 
see from looking at the diagram that the greater the 
photo-luminescence intensity, or rather the higher the impurity 
concentration, the greater the S-bit density. These tests 
further demonstrated that the S-bits originated from the 
impurities. 



<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  4.1 Gallium Arsenide 
  We were able to verify the safety of GaAs using an ampule 
having a three-fold structure. In this ampule, we grew crystal 
with the furnace on the ground, cut the crystal obtained in the 
process along the growth axis, and performed a crystallographic 
evaluation. According to that evaluation, the shape of the 
initial solid-liquid interface was convex on the seed crystal 
side, yet showed 16&percnt; crystal growth in the shortest areas 
and 
60&percnt; growth in the longest areas. 
  To evaluate crystal characteristics, we took an infrared 
transmission image and then measured distribution along the 
dopant concentration plane. We found that dopant concentration 
steadily rises as the crystal grows. This suggests that crystal 
growth was achieved under managed thermal convection. Next, we 
measured the Hall effect in the monocrystal area. We found that 
Hall mobility was the same as seed crystal in the initial stages 
of growth, and that it decreased later as etch-bit density 
increased. 
  4.2 Indium Phosphide 
  We elucidated the optimum conditions under which InP crystal 
can be grown by the THM method. A monocrystal of about 2 was 
obtained with a maximum temperature range between 880&deg;C and 
900&deg;C. We found that the main reason for polycrystallization 
was constitutional supercooling, and confirmed this by agreement 
between a yardstick arrived at by numerical calculation and 
actual test results. We also found that the lower the maximum 
temperatures, the smaller the EDP and the better the crystal 
quality. Meanwhile, by etching the (211) plane, we found 
impurities which indicate the effect of heat convection 
characteristic of IG. We believe that comparing the degree to 
which this occurs in space will give us the difference in flow 
behavior. 
  To evaluate the optical characteristics, we measured 
photoluminescence, and were able to confirm dopant distribution 
within the plane. The measurements for photoluminescence also 
confirmed the fact that S-bits, which had been assumed to be 
based on impurities, were, according to the experiments we 
conducted, associated with impurity concentrations.

  [Text] The Exposed Facility Flyer Unit (EFFU) is an orbital 
experimental facility to be mounted on the free flyer Space 
Flyer Unit (SFU). The SFU is scheduled to be launched by an H-II 
launch vehicle in early 1995. After several months in orbit, the 
SFU will be retrieved by the Space Shuttle. The EFFU will 
provide experience in developing the key technology of the 
Exposed Facility of Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), which will 
be attached to the Space Station Freedom in the late 1990s. The 
EFFU proto-flight model test was concluded. This paper describes 
the development of the EFFU. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  An international consortium of countries and organizations 
including the United States, Canada, Japan, and the ESA 
(European Space Association) have been working jointly to 
develop an international space station which they hope to 
complete by the end of the century. Japan is in charge of 
developing and operating the JEM (Japanese Experiment Model). 
Figure 1 is a schematic drawing of the JEM. The JEM Exposed 
Facility, which Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) is in 
charge of developing, is a system which offers an exposed 
testing environment in space. The Exposed Facility Flyer Unit 
(EFFU) is a part of the JEM Exposed Facility and was built with 
the aim of improving reliability in the key technologies used in 
the JEM and mastering common experimental technologies. The EFFU 
will be carried aboard the Space Flyer Unit (SFU), which is the 
first recoverable and reusable experimental satellite developed 
by Japan, and will be used to perform orbital experiments. 



  IHI has been working on the EFFU since 1987 after being 
awarded a contract by the National Space Development Agency 
(NASDA). The fabrication of the EFFU proto-flight model is now 
complete, and it is undergoing SFU system tests as part of the 
SFU. This paper outlines the development of the EFFU. 
<H5>  2. EFFU </H5>
  2.1 Overview of SFU 
  As we can see in Figure 2, the EFFU is mounted on the SFU. 
The SFU is being jointly developed by three government agencies, 
namely, NASDA, which is part of the Science and Technology 
Agency, the ISAS (Institute of Space and Astronautical Science), 
which is part of the Ministry of Education, and MITI (Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry). The SFU will be launched 
in February 1995 aboard an H-II rocket and be put into orbit at 
an altitude of about 500 km. It will be used to conduct various 
material and biological experiments and make astronomical 
observations for approximately 4.5 months, and then be recovered 
and returned to earth by the Space Shuttle (U.S.). During that 
time, the EFFU will conduct orbital experiments that will take 
up a total of about 1.5 months. 



  2.2 Overview of EFFU 
  2.2.1 Main Specifications of EFFU 
  Figure 3 is an external view of the EFFU. The main frame of 
the EFFU, which is a truss structure, is covered on the outside 
by a multi-layer insulator. The EFFU weighs 282 kg. Its external 
dimensions are approximately 1.5 m x 1.5 m x 1.05 m. Below, we 
list the main specifications of the EFFU.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 






    2.2.2 Mission of EFFU&lt;sup&gt; (1)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  The purpose of the EFFU is to perform the orbital 
experiments 
listed below and evaluate the results obtained therein. 
  (1) Element Technologies in Fluid Loop Heat Control 
  The principle heat control method used in the JEM Exposed 
Facility is based on fluid loops. The technical data obtained 
from the fluid loop of the EFFU will be used to ascertain the 
behavior characteristics of fluids in an orbital environment and 
verify the validity of the thermal analysis methods. For that 
reason, the fluid loops will be operated for extended periods of 
time while in orbit so that we can obtain fluid loop data such 
as fluid temperature and pressure, as well as temperature data 
on the EFFU equipment and frame. 
  (2) Element Technologies in Equipment Exchange Unit 
  The equipment exchange unit (EEU) of the JEM is a mechanism 
which has a mechanical disconnect function for disconnecting the 
experimental payload from the JEM exposed facility, and also an 
interface function for supplying power, communication, and 
fluids. The EFFU x EEU uses the same transfer load mechanism, 
coupling retention force, and solid lubrication method for 
moving parts that the JEM x EEU uses. While in orbit, the EEU 
will conduct repeated disconnects so that we can evaluate the 
soundness of the interfaces such as the electrical connectors 
and fluid couplers, and evaluate the durability of the solid 
lubricants. 
  (3) Acquiring Microgravity Characteristic Data 
  We installed micro-acceleration sensors near the excitation 
sources in the EFFU and the gas dynamics experiment facility 
(GDEF) to verify that the GDEF is operating in a microgravity 
environment. In addition, we want to compare and verify the 
results of ground tests and analysis against the orbital 
microgravity data, and evaluate the vibration transmission 
characteristic and response characteristic, and then use this 
information in analyzing the microgravity environment of the JEM. 
  (4) Exposure Experiment on Elements and Materials 
  The SFU will be put into an orbit that is almost stationary 
to that of the sun. We will attach material samples necessary in 
the development of the JEM on both the sunlit and shady sides of 
the external surface of the EFFU to evaluate the properties of 
those materials while in space. 
  (5) Gas Dynamics Experiment&lt;sup&gt; (6)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  In the gas dynamics experiment, we will verify the growth of 
diamond crystal by the chemical vapor deposition method in an 
orbital microgravity environment. 
  2.2.3 EFFU Configuration 
  In Figure 4, we show the configuration of the EFFU, and in 
Figure 5, show a functional block diagram of the same. 







    (1) Infrastructure&lt;sup&gt; (3),(4)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  The main frame within the structural system is a truss-type 
structure made up of titanium and CFRP members. The equipment is 
mounted to panels that are supported by the main frame. Figure 4 
is a schematic drawing of the EFFU infrastructure. 
  (2) Heat Control System 
  Heat control is maintained by a fluid loop, which acts as 
the 
cooling medium, a heater, and a multi-layer insulator. The fluid 
loop consists of a pump-inverter, hot plate, cold plate, and 
radiator. The heat generated by the equipment is absorbed by the 
cold plate, transported to the radiator by the fluid loop, and 
vented into space. The heater is also activated as needed by a 
thermostat. 
  Figure 6 is a block diagram of the fluid loop in the heat 
control system. 



  (3) Communication Control System 
  The communication control system is made up of an EFFU 
control unit. The ECU monitors and controls the equipment within 
the EFFU, and communicates with the SFU. 
  (4) Electrical Power System 
  The electrical power system consists of an electrical power 
distribution unit (EPDU) that receives electrical power from the 
SFU and distributes that to the equipment within the EFFU. The 
EDPU is equipped with fuses corresponding to the equipment being 
supplied power. 
  (5) Experiment Support System 
  The experiment support system consists of an EEU, a 
microgravity measuring unit, and an exposed test unit for 
elements and materials. 
  The EEU is made up of an equipment exchange unit for the 
exposed facility, an equipment exchange unit for the payload, 
and a motor drive unit (MDU) that runs and controls the 
equipment exchange unit motor. Figure 7 is a functional block 
diagram of the EFFU x EEU. 



  (6) Gas Dynamics Experiment Facility&lt;sup&gt; (6)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  The gas dynamics experiment facility aboard the EFFU 
consists 
of a plasma reaction vessel, a reaction gas cylinder, a 
spectroscope, a camera, and control unit. 
  2.3 NASA Safety Requirements 
  The SFU will be retrieved by the NASA (U.S. National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration) Space Shuttle. For that 
reason, the EFFU mounted aboard the SFU must meet NASA 
requirements regarding safety. A NASA safety review board is in 
the process of determining if those safety standards have been 
met. The safety review has completed its second phase (a review 
of hazard potentials and follow-up control plans). The third 
phase of the safety review is coming next in which a report will 
be issued detailing the results of implementing the control 
plans indicated in the prior phase based on tests and 
verification data. 
<H5>  3. Development Outlined </H5>
  The development of the EFFU, as can be seen in Figure 8, was 
based on the EM/PFM (engineering model/proto-flight model) 
system. This system integrates the PM (protomodel) with the FM 
(flight model) to form the PFM. 



  In the detailed engineering phase, we built and tested a 
prototype of the engineering model, which is the development 
model, while in the maintenance design phase, we built and 
tested the PFM. After the SFU system tests are complete, 
adjustments will be made to a final flight component during the 
pre-launch modification period, and built into the SFU for 
launch. 
<H5>  4. Development of Engineering Models </H5>
  As for engineering models, we built and tested prototypes of 
a structural development model, a thermal development model, a 
system engineering model, and an SFU interface engineering 
model. Figure 9 is a flow diagram showing the engineering models. 



  4.1 Structure Development Model Testing&lt;sup&gt; (3,4)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  A structural model of the CFRP members and components that 
make up the infrastructure was fabricated ahead of the 
engineering model by element prototyping and testing and 
subjected to the following two tests. 
  (1) A materials test to gather data on CFRP parts for the 
NASA safety review, included in which is a tensile strength and 
heat cycle degradation test on CFRP parts. 
  (2) A structural model fabrication test on parts to perfect 
the key technologies used for the truss-type frame. 
  The SDM is a model in which a mass dummy is attached to the 
frame of the engineering model. With the SDM, an assortment of 
tests including static load tests, vibration tests, and mass 
characteristics tests were given to verify the soundness of the 
structural design and the validity of the numerical model used 
for the structure, to also verify the environmental conditions 
of the on-board equipment, and to perfect the fabrication and 
testing methods. Further tests were done on EFFU coupling with 
the SFU. 
  Also, to satisfy the fail-safe requirements demanded by 
NASA, 
various tests including static load and vibration tests were 
given to verify structural strength. In addition, there was also 
a fluorescent penetration test on metal parts, and an ultrasonic 
penetrant examination for composite parts and bonded parts, but 
nothing abnormal was reported. 
  4.2 Thermal Development Model Tests 
  The thermal development model is a model in which a mass 
dummy is removed from the structure development model, and is 
replaced by heat control equipment and a heat dummy. With the 
thermal development model, a thermal equilibrium test and heat 
vacuum preliminary test were administered. A post-test analysis 
and evaluation verified the fact that the fluid loop performed 
as designed, and that the thermal numerical model was in fact 
sound. 
  4.3 System Engineering Model Tests 
  The system engineering model is identical to the 
proto-flight 
model with the exceptions being that the EEU is a dummy, and 
there are no microgravity sensors. As far as system engineering 
model tests, we performed an electrical performance test for the 
entire EFFU, and an electromagnetic compatibility test, but no 
abnormalities were reported. 
  4.4 SFU Interface Tests 
  In conducting a verification test on the electrical 
interface, which is implemented by direct connection with the 
SFU, the engineering model designed for the SFU interface test 
was loaded aboard the SFU system prior to the SEM and the 
electrical interfaces with the SFU were verified. 
  4.5 Microgravity Ground Tests 
  Using a model in which the heater function was removed from 
the thermal development model, we conducted a microgravity 
ground test and obtained microgravity characteristic data for 
ground operation of the fluid loop, and analysis data on the 
vibration mode of the EFFU. The data obtained was used to 
determine the gain in microgravity sensors, the locations where 
microgravity sensors should be installed, and the direction of 
measurement. 
<H5>  5. PFM System Development </H5>
  As for the proto-flight model, we implemented and 
successfully completed the following tests after the 
post-assembly inspection. 
  (1) Initial electrical performance test 
  (2) Vibration test 
  (3) Thermal equilibrium test and heat vacuum test 
  (4) Final electrical performance test 
  5.1 Electrical Performance Test 
  In the electrical performance test, we verified that the 
electrical functions and characteristics in the EFFU met the 
necessary requirements. Based on the test results from the 
function test and final electrical performance test that were 
given before and after the vibration test, and during and after 
the heat vacuum test, we confirmed that there was not any 
degradation from the environmental test. 
  5.2 Vibration Test 
  Figure 10 is a photograph showing the setup for the 
vibration 
test. We applied a sine-wave vibration load, which is about the 
same given in an acceptance test, directly to the three axes of 
the EFFU, but found nothing abnormal in the EFFU. Tests also 
confirmed that the EFFU met the necessary requirements with 
regard to rigidity, and that both the vibration mode and the 
primary inherent vibration frequency agreed with analysis. 



  5.3 Thermal Equilibrium Test and Heat Vacuum Test 
  Figure 11 is a photograph showing the setup of the heat 
vacuum test. Tests confirmed the properties of the heat control 
system, and also confirmed that the EFFU can operate normally in 
high-temperature and low-temperature thermal vacuum 
environments. The test results from the heat equilibrium test 
confirmed the validity of the analytic model used for the 
proto-flight model. 



<H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>
  The manufacture of the EFFU-PFM is complete. After the SFU 
system tests are done, we will make improvements to perfect the 
flight components, and then schedule delivery. 
  In the development of the EFFU, we have been able to use 
CFRP 
components in the frame, develop a heat control system using 
fluid loops, develop element technologies for the equipment 
exchange unit, and to develop a system for conducting exposed 
environment testing. We have also been able to master system 
integration technologies for developing not only the JEM Exposed 
Facility but also other futuristic space vehicles.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] A group led by professor Setsuji Higashinari of the 
Basic Engineering Department, Osaka University, has developed a 
pH-dependent ultrafiltration membrane that effectively separates 
and purifies desired substances such as proteins from mixtures 
containing multiple ingredients of various molecular weights. 
Moreover, the membrane does not adversely affect biological 
activity. This is the first case in which a 
separation/purification technique mediated by pH sensitivity has 
been realized. The separation and purification of useful 
substances produced by microbes and cultured plant and animal 
cells (bioproducts) is an essential technology in such major 
industries as pharmaceuticals and foods. Because separation 
efficiency is greater than with previous methods, and separation 
and purification are achieved in a single process, this new 
development will lead to greater efficiency in mass production. 
  Past protein separation and purification processes required 
such manufacturing steps as concentrating the protein by 
precipitation, fractionating by molecular size using gel 
filtration, separating by chromatography or other methods, and 
desalting by dialysis. This new membrane is a stimulus-response 
polymer membrane whose separation properties change according to 
pH. The protein can be concentrated, fractionated, and purified 
merely by passing it through the membrane. The pH-dependent 
ultrafiltration membrane is formed by dissolving a 
radical-polymerized copolymer consisting of 4-vinylpyridine and 
acrylonitrile in a 1:4 molar ratio in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in 
the presence of lithium nitrate, evaporating the solvent, and 
performing gelation to remove additional solvent. 
  To use the membrane for protein separation, the 
sugar-binding 
protein lectin is added to a cell lysate and ultrafiltration 
performed at high pH. At high pH, the molecular weight of the 
fraction passing through the membrane is high, but because the 
desired proteins bind to the lectin and essentially form a 
polymer, they are retained. This removes impurities that are 
lighter than or about the same molecular weight as the desired 
protein. Next the pH is lowered, which causes the desired 
protein to dissociate from the lectin. At low pH, the membrane 
becomes more hydrophilic, and it expands. When this happens, the 
pores in the membrane become smaller and the molecular weight of 
the fraction passing through the membrane is reduced. This time 
only the desired protein passes through the membrane, and it is 
separated from impurities of higher molecular weight, which are 
retained. 
  By utilizing the pH-dependent ultrafiltration membrane in 
this manner, it is possible to separate a desired substance from 
a mixture containing impurities of both higher and lower 
molecular weights. The membrane can be used not only to purify 
useful enzymes such as peroxidase and superoxidase mutase, but 
can also be used for glycoprotein bioproducts such as 
oligosaccharides.

  [Text]A group led by professor Takaichi Kubo at the 
Department of Science and Engineering, Kinki University, has 
successfully diffused calcium into a substrate of oxide ceramic 
by using laser implantation. Laser implantation employs a laser 
to diffuse substances on the surface of a material into its 
interior. Calcium is one component of bone, and because it is 
highly compatible with the human body, this achievement brings 
us one step closer to the development of a material that can be 
used as artificial bone. 
  Human bone is mainly composed of a substance called 
hydroxyapatite, which contains calcium and phosphorous. By using 
laser implantation to diffuse calcium, one of the major 
components of bone, throughout the substrate, the group has 
created a material that will not be rejected by the body. It is 
expected that laser implantation will be a simpler method of 
modifying materials than ion implantation. In laser 
implantation, a substance is deposited onto the surface of a 
substrate by vapor deposition. It is then irradiated by a laser 
from above, which causes it to diffuse into the substrate. 
  Professor Kubo's group applied this technique with calcium. 
They placed a vessel containing a substrate of alumina, an oxide 
ceramic, in a vacuum and deposited calcium onto its surface by 
vapor deposition. Then they irradiated the surface from above 
with a high-energy excimer laser, which caused the calcium and 
alumina to melt and flow together. When they analyzed the 
substrate, they found that the calcium and alumina had formed a 
mixed layer within the substrate, thus confirming successful 
surface modification. 
  At this point no experiments have been performed to 
determine 
the effects on the body of ceramics formed by this method. 
However, both calcium and alumina have highly biocompatible 
properties, so it is expected that there will be no problem in 
using this ceramic material as artificial bone to replace 
damaged areas, as teeth, etc. 
  Professor Kubo's group believes that surface modification 
using hydroxyapatite is also possible, which would form a 
material even more compatible with the body. However, it will be 
difficult to get phosphorous to diffuse using the present 
technique, so in the future this group will search for a 
phosphate compound that can be used in this procedure and try to 
form hydroxyapatite.

successfully synthesized polyester with lipase as a catalyst for 
the first time ever. This is a new polymerization reaction 
involving the opening of a &egr;-caprolactone ring, and the 
reaction product has an alcohol on one terminus and a carboxylic 
acid on the other. Its maximum molecular weight is 7700. The 
group will attempt to make this into an optically active polymer 
in the future by using group substitution. This polymerization 
method, which forms polyester under gentle conditions and uses 
simple substances abundant in nature as starting materials, is 
noteworthy because it is such an environmentally friendly 
process. 
  This achievement by Professor Kobayashi's group at Tohoku 
University is a result of their research on a series of 
enzyme-catalyzed polymerizations. More specifically, they 
discovered that a polymerization reaction involving 
&egr;-caprolactone occurs when the hydrolytic enzyme lipase is 
used. In their experiments they carried out bulk polymerization 
of &egr;-caprolactone using commercially available lipase P 
derived from Pseudomonas fluorescens and lipase B 
derived from Candida cylindracea [Candida 
rugosa] as a catalyst without further purification. The 
amount of lipase added was 50 mg per 1 millimole of monomer. 
  Polymerization results are shown in the accompanying table. 
When the temperature was 30&deg;C, the conversion rate of the 
monomer was only about 8&percnt; even when polymerization was 
carried 
out for ten days, and the molecular weight was only about 1100. 
When the polymerization temperature was raised to 45&deg;C, 
60&deg;C, and 75&deg;C, both the monomer conversion rate and the 
molecular weight increased, and molecular weight increased with 
longer polymerization times. The group also learned that the 
molecular weight is reduced if carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc., 
are added.

  In experiments thus far, polymerization at 75&deg;C and ten 
days yielded a maximum monomer conversion rate of 92&percnt; and 
a 
maximum molecular weight of 7700. It was also found that lipase 
P yields a higher molecular weight product than lipase B. 
  The structure of the compound was analyzed by proton and &lt;sup&gt; 13&lt;/sup&gt; 

C nuclear magnetic resonance. It was found that 
the main chain of the polymer has polyester linkages, and it has 
an alcohol group on one terminus and a carboxylic acid group on 
the other. Based on the study of other lactone, cyclic 
anhydride, and diol polymerizations, it appears that this 
reaction mechanism is a new type of polymerization accompanied 
by an opening of the ring. The group plans a more detailed study 
of the mechanism in the future. 
  In any event, the group has confirmed for the first time 
that 
polyester can be synthesized under the mild conditions of 
60&deg;-70&deg;C at normal atmospheric pressure from simple 
compounds, including the necessary starting ingredients. Amid 
increasing concern over environmental problems, biodegradable 
polymers have attracted a lot of attention. However, this kind 
of polymerization, which does not use reagents that require 
special disposal after the reaction, is noteworthy from the 
standpoint of energy efficiency as well. It appears to have a 
promising future.

  [Text] A group led by professor Nobuo Nakabayashi and 
assistant professor Kazuhiko Ishihara, Tokyo Medical and Dental 
University, and professor Kimio Kurita, Faculty of Science and 
Engineering, Nihon University have developed a polymer membrane 
that can separate platelets, which are present in blood, without 
deforming them. Platelets are activated when they come in 
contact with foreign objects and lose their shape, but in blood 
this newly developed polymer membrane has a surface similar to 
that of the inside of a blood vessel, so it can extract 
platelets without causing their deformation. It is expected that 
this membrane will find a wide range of applications such as in 
the manufacture of platelet-derived preparations used for 
hemostasis and bone marrow transplants, in the diagnosis of 
illnesses, etc. The research group will announce its results at 
the meeting of the Society for Polymer Science to be held in 
Kyoto on 31 May. 
  To remove platelets the newly developed membrane is placed 
in 
contact with blood for about one hour. Because the platelets 
attach themselves to the membrane, when it is removed from the 
blood and washed in physiological saline, non-activated 
platelets can be obtained. 
  The polymer membrane is a sheet of the biocompatible organic 
material MPC (methacryloyl hydroxyethyl phosphorylcholine) to 
which positively and negatively charged substances have been 
bound. When blood comes in contact with the MPC membrane, the 
phospholipids in the blood adhere tightly to the surface of the 
membrane. Because phospholipids are components of the cell 
membranes in blood vessels, etc., the membrane is not recognized 
as a foreign object in the blood. The group believes that is why 
the platelets do not become activated. 
  Blood component preparations made from platelets are used 
for 
hemostasis and bone marrow transplants, but activated platelets 
cannot be administered because they cause blood clots. 
  Currently platelets are extracted from blood by 
centrifugation to avoid activation, but it appears that they can 
be separated much more easily when this membrane is used. It 
appears that it is possible to extract erythrocytes and 
leukocytes as well by varying the substances bound to the MPC 
membrane. In the future this membrane may find wide-ranging 
applications such as in the study and diagnosis of diseases in 
which blood cell abnormalities occur.

  [Text] NTT Basic Research Laboratories has developed an 
ultra-sensitive molecular detection technique that can detect a 
concentration of 2 ppt (parts per trillion), the concentration 
of sugar that would result if a sugar cube weighing three grams 
were dissolved in 1.5 million tons of water, a volume roughly 
three times the size of the Kasumigaseki Building. The detection 
technique is based on electrochemical methods, but the 
sensitivity is a thousand times greater than with conventional 
methods. This technique can detect slight variations in the 
concentration of substances present in trace amounts in body 
fluids, so it can aid in the diagnosis of illness, and it can 
also be used to study the behavior of neurotransmitters and help 
clarify the mechanism of information transfer. Wide-ranging 
applications in basic medicine and bioscience can be expected 
for this technology. 
  Among the ultra-sensitive methods for detecting molecules in 
liquids there is the ``radiochemical-enzymatic method,'' in 
which a special reagent that contains a radioactive isotope and 
that will react with the substance of interest is allowed to 
bind to the substance of interest, and the concentration of the 
substance of interest is determined by the quantity of 
radioactivity. There is also the ``chemiluminescence method,'' 
in which a special fluorescent reagent is allowed to bind to the 
substance of interest, and the concentration is determined by 
measuring the fluorescence. There are difficulties, however, 
because in both cases these special reagents are difficult to 
handle, and the procedures are complex. In addition, the 
``electrochemical method'' has also been used because it is fast 
and simple. 
  The new detection technique developed by NTT is a kind of 
electrochemical method. The electrochemical method is one in 
which the concentration of a substance is determined from the 
current and voltage during electrolysis of a liquid containing 
the substance of interest. With previous electrochemical 
methods, however, it has been impossible to accurately detect 
the concentration corresponding to the value for the current 
when the current is very small, so these methods were not 
suitable for the detection of substances at extremely low 
concentrations. 
  The reason for such low sensitivity is that the electron 
exchange between the electrode and the substance of interest is 
only one electron per molecule, so the resulting current is 
extremely small. Researchers at NTT thought that if they could 
solve this problem, they could make use of the simplicity and 
speed of the electrochemical method and at the same time create 
a system that would enable detection with high sensitivity. They 
came up with an electrochemical reaction system based on the 
completely new concept of using small, comb-shaped electrodes to 
increase the current value. 
  With this system, one of the electrodes that carries out the 
electrochemical reaction with the substance of interest is 
shaped like a comb with narrow spaces between the teeth, and 
another electrode of the same shape is paired with it so the 
teeth interlock but do not touch. The molecules of the substance 
of interest accept an electron from one of the comb-shaped 
electrodes and donate that electron to the other comb-shaped 
electrode. Therefore, the molecules repeat the electron exchange 
(redox) reaction many times. This change in design alone has 
resulted in a current about 30 times greater than with 
conventional electrochemical methods. 
  In addition, to obtain a larger current, the comb-shaped 
electrode is connected to another electrode in a separate vessel 
that contains metal ions. This electrode continues to receive 
electrons from the comb-shaped electrode, which acts as a medium 
for the substance of interest. Those electrons are donated to 
the metal ions in the separate vessel, so in the separate 
vessel, the ions become metal atoms and precipitate. This metal 
becomes a cumulative record of electrons that the substance of 
interest carried between the two comb-shaped electrodes. If a 
current is then passed in the opposite direction, a current peak 
about 1000 times greater than with conventional electrochemical 
methods can be obtained. When we know what kind of substance we 
are measuring, by measuring peak current we can determine the 
concentration. Since the current peak is amplified 1000 times, 
the concentration can also be measured with the same precision. 
  The molecular detection technique developed by NTT can also 
measure electrochemically inert substances if there are active 
substances that react specifically with them. For example, it is 
known that patents with Parkinson's disease have reduced levels 
of dopamine in their brains, and NTT has confirmed that this 
technique can detect dopamine. 
  In addition, because the structure of the system is simple, 
by incorporating LSI technology NTT hopes to make the detector 
compact and available at an affordable price so that it can be 
used in many different fields.

  [Text]The research group including Professor Hideyoshi 
Tsuchida of the Waseda University, Engineering Faculty, Polymer 
Research Lab, Lecturer Kimiyoshi Yamamoto, and researchers 
leading the Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC) 
developed a simple synthesis method for polyphenylene sulfide 
(PPS) which is amorphous and has a molecular weight of 250,000. 
This was discovered as a part of the research to establish an 
industrial process for synthesizing PPS directly from aromatic 
compounds such as sulfur chloride, xylene, and diphenyl sulfide. 
This makes possible the production at one tenth the present 
price of PPS if produced on the same scale as existing plants. 
Super molecular weight PPS which was synthesized with a new 
method via polysulfonium can be processed into a transparent 
film or fibers; moreover, polysulfonium as a stable intermediate 
product is expected to have many applications such as 
photoresist, temperature sensors, polymer alkyl reaction 
reagent, and ion exchange resin. 
  The research group of Professor Tsuchida discovered an 
oxidative polymerization reaction system where PPS can be 
synthesized at a yield of nearly 100&percnt; when xylene and 
sulfur 
chloride are reacted at normal temperatures and normal pressures 
in the presence of trace quantities of vanadyl compound under an 
air flow. 
  Characteristics are that the polymerization reaction 
progresses at room temperature, byproducts are not produced, and 
high purity PPS can be synthesized. Prior research confirms that 
it is sufficiently used as a low cost, practical process with a 
simple method which can produce it just by mixing two compounds. 
  On the other hand, it was confirmed that it was possible to 
synthesize selectively a useful disulfide compound by 
suppressing the oxidation process with aromatic compounds and 
sulfur chloride in the same reaction. When the bis(4-bromophenyl 
thiophenyl)disulfide attained with this method is polymerized, 
the synthesis of super molecular weight PPS becomes possible. 
  Furthermore, the method to synthesize amorphous, super 
molecular weight PPS was newly discovered from the new synthesis 
reaction system to be the initial source of sulfide compounds. 
  The characteristics of this system are the point of making 
polysulfonium which is soluble in the solvent be the source 
material, that it is easy to grow high molecular weight bodies, 
and that the methyl radical can be simply removed from the 
polymer formed. Thus, the super high molecular weight PPS with a 
molecular weight of about 250,000 was successfully synthesized. 
  Since this PPS can be produced at room temperature unlike 
prior products from prior research, it was confirmed that it is 
amorphous and its processing into films or fibers is simple. 
  Also, with this method, sulfide and sulfonium are 
alternately 
connected via the phenyl radical and the synthesis of 
polysulfonium having a very high, super polarized structure 
became possible. Because this material has optical and 
electrical properties, much is expected of it as a new material.

  [Text]The Niihama Plant epoxy facilities of Sumitomo 
Chemical Co., Ltd. will restart operations in a day or two and 
are expected to begin shipping in mid-December. On 4 November, 
Niihama city decided to remove the plant stoppage order; 
Sumitomo Chemical, which received that order, is expected to 
restart operations in a day or two and to switch to a shipping 
system in December over a trial operating period of about one 
month. As a result, the prospect for shipping restart from the 
end of this year to the beginning of next year is premature. 
  Since Sumitomo Chemical's orthocresolnovolak epoxy fire, 
voices wishing for the early restarting of the semiconductor 
sealing material market have strengthened. While operations to 
restart the plant are advancing smoothly and the turmoil in the 
market during this period was avoided because of shipping 
support from another company in the same industry, the restart 
time of this plant was noted. Because of the stoppage canceling 
order of the local Niihama city, the operation of novolak 
facilities was restarted. This month it is expected to switch to 
trial operations to receive sample shipping and user evaluation 
and to make full scale shipping at the beginning of December.

<F P=106> [Article by Yasuaki Nagahiro] </F>
  [Text]Despite the fear with the stringency at the end of 
this year being partly for the supply of package sealing 
material, LSI makers have begun to agree with the idea that 
there is ``no worry even if DRAM production is increased.'' Most 
of the LSI makers in the country will increase DRAM production 
by 20&percnt; from now until the end of the year. By companies 
ensuring their source of supply and inventory, the supply is 
sufficient for two to three months in the future. At the 
beginning of next year, the plant of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. 
which had an accident will partially recover and increase the 
quantity of production. Many LSI makers say that the movement 
towards reducing the amount of epoxy resin used which began 
after the accident will advance in the future as well. There are 
costs from the perspective of environmental problems as well. On 
the other hand, the raw material of the sealing material can be 
ensured in terms of quantity, but the problems of an oligopoly 
remain in that system as usual. 
  The instability in the supply of epoxy resin which is the 
raw 
material for package sealer was caused by the accident of 
Sumitomo Chemical (previously reported in the August 1993 issue 
of this magazine, pp 123-124), but according to the recovery 
plan after the accident reported by this company on 5 August, it 
was estimated that the previous supply can be ensured in January 
of next year. The supply will decrease within the year, but 
appears to be supported by the inventory. 
  Even considering the DRAM production increase plan (see 
``Domestic LSI makers together to increase DRAM production 
20&percnt;'' published separately) presented here by the LSI 
companies 
together, an outstanding shortage does not occur. In the future, 
the estimate of whether the demand of industry as a whole will 
be satisfied is divided among LSI makers, but companies will 
ensure their own portion even when responding ``some shortage'' 
in the survey conducted by this magazine at the beginning of 
October (Table 1). 
  Makers saying ``no shortage'' were Toshiba, Fujitsu, and Oki 
Electric Industry. In particular, Toshiba makes the same 
estimate as the optimistic MITI presentation in August 
(previously reported in the September 1993 issue of this 
magazine, pp 123-125). Therefore, measures toward reducing the 
amount of epoxy used have not been planned in particular. Of 
course, Fujitsu and Oki Electric Industry also are ``ensuring 
the supply for our company'' and say they are not worried about 
a shortage. 
  NEC and Hitachi said ``some shortage.'' NEC especially gave 
concrete figures of 5 to 10&percnt; and estimated a shortage. In 
the 
background, both companies appear to be biased towards a single 
supplier of sealing material. Because a supply shortage will 
result if the supplier cannot ensure the epoxy in this type of 
system, the influence of the demand of the industry as a whole 
is easily applied. NEC has already ensured enough for two to 
three months and damage to the user appears slight. 
<H5>  Long term reduction of quantity of epoxy used </H5>
  Many LSI makers say the technical development because of the 
reduction in the amount of epoxy used which began when the 
supply instability occurred will continue. The following 
countermeasures for reducing the amount used have been found: 
  (1) increasing the coefficient of utilization for the 
sealing 
material; 
  (2) increasing the filler charging rate; 
  (3) changing to a biphenyl system. 
  Despite the excess or deficiency, they are handled as a part 
of the environmental countermeasures. 
  (1) and (2) were given by all of the makers surveyed as 
useful means of reduction. NEC says it can raise the coefficient 
of utilization by 20 to 30&percnt; and Oki Electric by 
30&percnt;. With (2) 
for increasing the filler charging rate and reducing the epoxy, 
Oki Electric reduced the percentage of epoxy from 20&percnt; to 
10&percnt;. 
Hitachi reduced the quantity of epoxy used 20&percnt;. NEC and 
Oki 
Electric are examining the change in materials in (3). 
  With the progress of these countermeasures, there is a risk 
that there will once again be an epoxy surplus. The supply from 
Choshunjinzo Resin of Taiwan, on which Sumitomo Chemical relies 
for joint production, began and the first line of Sumitomo 
Chemical aiming for a year end recovery is said to be ``recovery 
is smooth.'' There is also the stronger production of Nippon 
Kayaku Co., Ltd. The time is undecided, but the danger of a 
supply surplus is high if another line of Sumitomo Chemical 
recovers. 
  Also, when the quantity of filler is increased, there is a 
possibility that an unstable supply of filler will result next. 
The general use, spherical silica is becoming mainstream as a 
filler material effective for low stress because of the state of 
oligopoly of the electro-chemical industry. 
<H3>  Domestic LSI makers together to increase DRAM production 
20&percnt; </H3>
  US and Japan LSI makers have set about increasing DRAM 
production together. In the background, the major 4M sales are 
satisfactory mainly in the United States. 
  First on the list is NEC and Hitachi making 10 million per 
month by the end of the year; most will increase production of 
4M by about 20&percnt;. 
  The two means of increasing production are to strengthen the 
production capacity and to switch production items. Two methods 
to switch production items are the method of switching to the 
shrink edition and expanding the production quantity and the 
method of reducing the 1M production quantity and turning back 
the production surplus. 
  NEC and Toshiba are expanding production capacity. With 
continuing satisfactory 4M demand, production facilities will be 
added to the current mass production plants by next spring. 
Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Oki Electric Industries are handling the 
item switch. Hitachi and Oki Electric avoided additional 
investment as it is unclear whether the 4M demand will continue. 
The shrink edition production percentage is drawn upwards. 
Fujitsu is reducing the production of the 1M cut down edition 
and turning toward production capacity. 
  United States manufacturers are also increasing production. 
The Texas Instruments company will strengthen 4M production 
capacity 35&percnt; by next spring. Along with increasing the 
production capacity of existing plants, they operated the 
Singapore plant constructed in a joint venture. Also, the United 
States Motorola company has said it will somewhat increase 
Tohoku Semiconductor in a joint venture with Toshiba by next 
spring. 
  On the other hand, Korean manufacturers will not increase 4M 
production. This is because process technicians are divided by 
the switch to low voltage production and because the shift to 
16M is sudden.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  In recent years electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted 
increasing attention. Mitsubishi Motors Corporation has recently 
developed, in succession to various types of EVs previously 
developed, a new EV (developed in cooperation with The Tokyo 
Electric Power Co., Ltd.) for commercial use which makes full 
use of a state-of-the-art motor, motor control and battery 
technologies. 
  This paper outlines the present status of Mitsubishi's EVs 
with respect to their driving performance, maximum traveling 
distance per battery charge, etc. and gives a brief overview of 
the expected future trend of EVs. 
  Key words: Electric Vehicle, Environment 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Together with economic growth and achievement of a high 
standard of living in recent years, energy consumption has also 
seen a yearly increase, particularly in that large amounts of 
fossil fuel have been consumed. Under these circumstances, 
global environmental problems such as air pollution resulting 
from fossil fuel consumption, global warming resulting from 
increases in carbon dioxide, acid rain caused by the emission of 
sulfur dioxides into the atmosphere, and so forth have emerged 
as serious social problems. 
  Under these conditions, electric vehicles (EVs) which do not 
emit exhaust fumes are highly anticipated because they have the 
most potential as non-polluting vehicles. 
  In the United States, the California Air Resources Board has 
enacted a law that requires automakers to sell ZEVs 
(Zero-Emission-Vehicles = electric vehicles) at a certain rate 
from 1998 onward, and it has since commenced enforcing several 
restrictions for this purpose. In Japan, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry made their plans to popularize 
and foster EVs and has began preparing for completing related 
standards and certification procedures, while local 
self-governing bodies and electric power corporations are 
actively introducing EVs. 
  The following section will outline the present status and 
future development trends of EVs. 
<H5>  2. Present Status of Electric Vehicles </H5>
  The recent development of EVs in Japan has experienced its 
first boom when a large-scale inter-corporate project was 
commenced with the aim of developing EVs as a measure to cope 
with the intensified restrictions for gasoline engine vehicle's 
exhaust emissions adopted in 1970. However, this condition did 
not last long because every automaker's gasoline engines could 
meet the revised emission standard. 
  However, today, development of EVs has again become quite 
active in view of the increased challenge of protecting the 
global environment. Meanwhile, MMC has performed a series of 
research and development on EVs as shown in Table 1. This 
research was initially commenced in 1966 when they started the 
development and research of basic technologies for the vehicle 
propelling electric motor, battery, etc. which are EV's basic 
components. Beginning with the development of an 
electric-powered bus in 1973, MMC developed various EVs using 
their products such as the MINICAB, DELICA, MINICA, etc. as 
bases and produced about one hundred and twenties of EVs up to 
now. 



  In 1991 MMC and The Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. succeeded 
in the joint development of an EV version Lancer which 
incorporated various electric motor-, motor control- and 
battery-related new technologies and significantly exceeded all 
conventional EVs in driving performance. 
<H5>  3. Required Performance </H5>
  The EV version Lancer was developed aiming at providing it 
with driving performance and the capability of creating a 
comfortable driving environment which had never been previously 
attained by conventional EVs while taking into consideration the 
problems experienced with the EVs which were previously used in 
metropolitan areas. 
  3.1 Driving Performance 
  To determine a driving performance that would ensure an 
inherent handling which was comparable to that of internal 
combustion engine vehicles on both general roads and the 
expressways, running speeds and accelerations/decelerations were 
measured by performing actual test runs on general roads and 
expressways in the metropolitan area (Figure 1). 



  From the measurement results, maximum speed and accelerating 
ability that the EV version Lancer was expected to have were 
determined as shown in Table 2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The hill-climbing ability was determined taking in 
consideration ramps from underground parking lots and steep 
uphill slopes of ordinary roads. 
  3.2 Distance Covered on a Fully Charged Battery 
  Assuming that the longest round trip distance between two 
places for commercial purposes is approximately 70 km and 
considering that power consumption somewhat increases during the 
in-city operation due to repeated acceleration and deceleration, 
the distance that needs to be covered on a fully charged battery 
was determined to be more than 200 km. 
  3.3 Equipment 
  In order to provide the new EV with good controllability for 
easy-driving and a comfortable interior environment, the vehicle 
was equipped with an electro-over-hydraulic steering system and 
electric air conditioning system, both incorporating control 
technologies for ensuring minimum power consumption. 
  Figure 2 illustrates the configuration of the main 
components 
such as the electric motor and its control unit, onboard battery 
charger, power steering system, etc. mounted in the modified 
Lancer body, while Figure 3 [photo not reproduced] shows the 
external view of the EV version Lancer. 



<H5>  4. Major Components </H5>
  The following section describes the electric motor and the 
battery both of which are the key components which govern the 
performance of the EV. 
  4.1 Electric Motor 
  Both AC and DC motors are usable as powerplants for EVs. For 
development purposes, two vehicles were produced, one being 
equipped with a DC motor and the other with an AC motor so that 
their characteristics could be compared. Table 3 shows the 
comparison between the two types of electric motors.

available batteries developed for automobile use as a battery 
that can meet the distance per battery charge requirement. The 
reason for this selection was that it had high energy density, 
featured long service-life and was easy to handle. Table 4 
compares some types of batteries with respect to their 
characteristics.

<H5>  7. Future of EVs </H5>
  What are the future development and popularization 
perspectives of EVs that have lately been attracting ongoing 
attention as the most potential environment-friendly vehicles? 
  From the technical viewpoint, it is necessary to further 
improve the driving performance through development of 
technologies that permit reduction in vehicle weight, rolling 
resistance, air resistance, etc. and introduction of much 
smaller and lighter electric motors and auxiliary equipment 
having high efficiency and power conservation capabilities. It 
is also our hope to develop a regenerative control technology 
that allows the efficient recovery of the energy generated 
during braking. 
  Moreover, increasing battery performance that is the EV's 
energy source is a prerequisite for improving the performance of 
EVs. It is anticipated that the development of small-sized and 
light weight batteries capable of storing energy in high density 
will necessarily be accelerated as the development of EVs 
further advances. 
  Regarding popularization of EVs in the future, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry of Japan estimates that in 
the year 2000, 100,000 EVs will be produced and a total of 
200,000 EVs will be owned in Japan (Figure 4 cited from Japan 
Electric Vehicle Council's document ``Electric Vehicle Promoting 
Plan''). 



  At the same time, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry has a plan to establish 2,000 service stations equipped 
with battery charging facilities nationwide as an infrastructure 
to compensate for the EV's short traveling distance on a fully 
charged battery which is its weak point, thereby expanding the 
running radius of EVs. 
  The Advance Battery Consortium has also been established in 
the United States, and with the support of the government, 
active research and development are presently under way to find 
technologies that will enable the practical use of EVs. MMC will 
devote itself to producing high performance EVs.

  [Text] The Petroleum Energy Center (PEC), directed by 
Yasunori Tateuchi, chairman of the Japan Petroleum Association, 
plans to put two naphtha-based phosphate fuel cells into 
operation in July and October of this year. In July, it will put 
a 50KW phosphate fuel cell into operation at the Kuwa House 
located in Waraku-no-kyo in Chiba Prefecture, and in October, 
put a 200KW phosphate fuel cell into operation at the Global 
Environment Industrial Research Institute [Chikyu Kankyo Sangyo 
Gijutsu Kiko] in Kyoto. The aim will be to conduct demonstration 
tests and evaluate their performance over the next three years. 
  The PEC will begin testing a 50KW and 200KW phosphate fuel 
cell this year as part of its research to demonstrate 
high-efficiency petroleum energy systems. 
  In addition to a 50KW fuel cell which will be put into 
operation starting in July at the Kuwa House in Waraku-no-kyo in 
Chiba Prefecture, the PEC also plans to put a 200KW fuel cell 
into operation in October at the Global Environment Industrial 
Research Institute. 
  The research calls for tests on a naphtha-based phosphate 
fuel cells, followed by tests on another kerosene-type fuel cell 
which is nearing completion. In other activities, it is also 
promoting R&amp;D on a high-temperature fuel cell having to do 
with 
petroleum cogeneration and public sector use. 
  Fuel cells, which are high-efficiency electrothermal supply 
systems, are being developed by the petroleum, electric power, 
and gas industries.

  [Text] In response to the growing demand for natural gas, 
the MITI Agency of Natural Energy and Resources has announced 
some new natural gas development projects which it has 
categorized as either large, mid-size, or very long-term 
projects. These projects are being offered in response to the 
increased costs and the difficulties in developing natural gas 
due to environmental concerns, to the competition between 
countries wanting natural gas that has occurred as a result of 
countries no longer willing to finance natural gas development, 
and lastly, to the increased demand for natural gas in Eastern 
Asia. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
intends to raise the issue of natural gas development as one of 
the key energy measures it will promote next year. To do that, 
it plans to beef up the development of natural gas and the way 
that oil corporations function at the liquefaction stage, and in 
the future, promote funding of large-scale projects (Sakhalin, 
Natuna, etc.) and develop mid-size projects (Papua New Guinea, 
Borneo, Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, etc.), which are likely to pose 
future problems in terms of development, and try to make inroads 
at the executive levels of natural gas departments in oil 
corporations. 
  Also, in the area of long-term projects lacking adequate 
structures such as in Turkmenistan, the agency is planning to 
have the oil corporations themselves develop master plans and do 
the necessary feasibility studies by conducting research surveys 
on natural gas development and business conditions. 
  Meanwhile, a study will also be done on receiving and 
distribution systems for natural gas in Japan. Specifically, it 
is considering the idea of relieving some of the growing 
congestion on the Pacific coast by building a base for unloading 
natural gas on the Japan Sea coast. MITI is also thinking about 
using offgas fields on the Japan Sea coast as underground 
storage bases to deal with peak periods and energy security 
needs. 
  In addition to these activities, the agency also plans to 
conduct a feasibility study on a domestic LPG supply system 
(medium-range project) that would be built around a pipeline 
laid between a supply base on the Japan Sea coast and demand 
bases in the Tokai and Kanto areas. It also plans to introduce 
new policies to promote economic cooperation on energy with 
other Asian-Pacific countries.

  [Text] The Institute of Applied Energy Research (director: 
K. Yamamoto) recently released a report detailing its mid- to 
long-term vision of business activities over the next five 
years. The report touched on a number of key areas it considers 
to be important for the future. In the area of nuclear power, 
the report discussed making light-water reactor technology more 
sophisticated and developing and evaluating new FBR 
(fast-breeder reactor) technologies. In the area of fossil 
energies, it mentioned research on developing methane hydrate, 
the development of low-temperature carbonization methods for 
low-grade coal, research on perfecting effective uses for 
asphalt by-products (excess C-grade heavy oil), and research for 
developing methods to make low-polluting fuels (emulsion fuels) 
from ultra-heavy oil. The first mid- to long-term vision report 
was created in 1987, but now five years later, with a staff of 
more than 50 people and a budget for its programs reaching 
&yen;1.2 billion, a complete revision of its projects was in 
order. 
  The mid- to long-term vision report said the Institute of 
Applied Energy Research was the leading research organization in 
Japan in the field of energy engineering. It said that the 
institute was committed to providing the most far-sighted and 
best possible research to meet the demands of both the public 
and private sector. In terms of business activities, the 
institute is involved with the following: 
  (1) Collecting and evaluating data on energy technologies 
  (2) Conducting surveys on energy technologies and setting 
directions of growth 
  (3) Proposing policies and strategies for developing energy 
technologies 
  (4) Conducting international exchange programs, and 
sponsoring educational programs related to energy technologies 
  The key research projects covered areas such as nuclear 
energy, fossil fuel energy, new energy and/or energy systems, or 
those that combine one or another of the above areas. The 
research projects were further subdivided into those that have 
already begun, those with short-term goals, and those with 
long-term goals. 
  Nuclear power is expected to become the main source of 
energy 
by the 21st century, but because of the strong anti-nuclear 
sentiments in Japan, the institute says it will work harder to 
make light-water reactor technology more refined and 
sophisticated by trying to depict nuclear reactors as beneficial 
and not dangerous. Another important area of research is finding 
a quick solution to the problem of treating and disposing of 
high-level radioactive wastes. 
  In the area of fossil fuel energies, the institute plans to 
continue working on research to perfect the natural gas/methanol 
cycle, and at the same time promote research on methane 
hydrates, which are non-conventional sources of natural gas, by 
the electric power and gas companies. With respect to coal, the 
institute wants to subject coals such as lignite and brown coal 
to thermal decomposition and develop a low-temperature 
carbonization method for making a low-grade coal in which a 
15&percnt; 
gasoline-diesel distillate and a 60&percnt; low-temperature coke 
(equal to average coal) can be obtained. By doing this, the 
institute hopes to use spontaneous combustion to find effective 
uses for brown coal resources which are hard to transport over 
great distances. 
  As for oil, in addition to looking for ways to perfect uses 
for asphalt by-products, the institute will continue its 
research on developing a high-efficiency garbage burning 
generation system that uses oil. 
  In terms of expanding the range of uses for super-heavy oil, 
it plans to develop emulsion fuels from asphalt distillates and 
tar sand by dispersing super-heavy oils in water, or conversely, 
dispersing water within super heavy oil, mixing this with 
calcium ions to improve combustibility, so that it can be used 
to desulfurize reactor cores.

  [Text] The Government Industrial Research Institute in 
Osaka (GIRI/Osaka director: Reikichi Iwamoto), which is part of 
the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, has 
successfully developed a solid electrolyte battery with high 
electrical output at room temperature. The battery reportedly 
suffered no loss of performance even after 200 repeated charging 
and discharging operations. 
  Until now, solid electrolyte batteries have demonstrated 
poor 
ion conductivity and weak current output at room temperature. 
The solid electrolyte battery which GIRI has developed resolves 
these problems by employing a solid electrolyte called 
tetramethyl-ammoniumhydroxide pentahydrate which is known to 
have good hydrogen ion conductivity. 
  The tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate battery 
maintains its hydrogen ion conduction properties even when 
melted and recooled. When this material is used as the 
electrolyte, the battery uses nickel hydroxide for the positive 
electrode and a hydrogen-occluded alloy for the negative 
electrode. When the hydrate is melted and enclosed, the gap 
between electrolyte particles, and the electrical resistance 
between the electrolyte and electrodes, decreases. As a result, 
a high current density of 10 milliamps per square centimeter is 
obtained. 
  The solid electrolyte battery suffered no loss in 
performance 
even after being subjected to repeated charging and discharging 
up to 200 times between temperatures of 0&deg;C to 40&deg;C. 
When the battery was left to stand for one day after being 
charged, however, electrical output dropped and it could not be 
used at temperatures greater than 40&deg;C, so GIRI says it 
plans to try and resolve this problem in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Masato Ishizawa, staff writer: ``Toyota Sells </F>
the Secret of Its Success''] 
  [Text] Toyota Motor Corp.'s world-renowned production 
system has helped it sell more passenger cars than any other 
automaker. Now, the company has decided to sell some of the 
secrets of this key process. 
  In late October, Toyota joined with Mitsui Engineering &amp; 
Shipbuilding Co. to set up a subsidiary, Toyota Caelum Inc., to 
market computer-aided design and manufacturing systems 
(CAD/CAM), which allow engineers to not only design products but 
to control manufacturing processes. 
  Toyota Caelum -- which has been formed from Toyota Motor's 
Caelum division -- is also negotiating with Ford Motor Co. to 
sell graphic displays, which are used to make blueprints of car 
bodies and engines, said the subsidiary's president, Iwao 
Isomura. 
  The computer systems, run on engineering workstations or 
personal computers, were originally developed by Toyota's 
systems engineers and have been used at the automaker's domestic 
and overseas plants as well as at its parts suppliers. 
<H5>  Choice of Dimensions </H5>
  The systems offer both two- and three-dimensional software. 
The 3-D version, of course, allows easier design of machinery 
and electric appliances and can be linked with computer-aided 
engineering, computer-aided manufacturing and computer-aided 
testing software. 
  Toyota says the systems allow users to readily grasp the 
design process, from development through production, and 
encourage quality control, allowing structural and material 
changes to be incorporated without having to rework the entire 
process. 
  The systems also have allowed engineers from both Toyota and 
its parts suppliers to directly exchange data and cooperate in 
the development of passenger cars. 
  Said Hiromi Araki, chief executive officer at Toyota Caelum, 
``Our system is different from other CAD/CAM software because it 
accounts for factors peculiar to stamp-pressing and molding, 
such as the resiliency of materials to shrinkage.'' 
  He also said that unlike other CAD/CAM systems, many of 
which 
have been designed for the production of small volumes of 
airplanes, the Toyota Caelum system can be used in the 
manufacture of large volumes of products of uniform quality. 
  Not the least of the new subsidiary's goals is earning money 
through the sale of computer systems. 
  ``We have separated the computer-system division from Toyota 
and started to aggressively sell the system to non-group firms 
in order to generate funds to develop (even more) upgraded 
systems,'' Araki said. Because revenue from the Caelum division 
was only a small part of Toyota's huge sales, the division has 
been unable to acquire sufficient funds and talented systems 
engineers. 
  Actually, Toyota began selling output from Caelum -- which 
stands for Computer-Aided Engineering Leading Ultimate 
Manufacturing -- to other firms in electric appliance and 
machinery industries in 1989. With the growing need in Japanese 
industry to cut research and development costs, sales of the 
computer system grew more than 20&percnt; year on year. 
  In the next five years, the subsidiary plans to boost sales 
to firms outside the Toyota group from 20&percnt; of all sales 
to more 
than 50&percnt; and expand annual sales from &yen;5.5 billion to 
&yen;10.5 billion, the company said. 
  Through the subsidiary, Toyota will also offer consulting 
services to improve production efficiency. But many Toyota 
officials are concerned that some of the company's key 
technology may be leaked with the sale of the computer systems.

<F P=106> [Article by Yoshikazu Miura: ```Gigantic Moles' Getting </F>
Bigger''] 
  [Text] With a population of over 120 million squeezed onto 
a mountainous island chain, it is perhaps no surprise that Japan 
has sprouted the world's most advanced tunneling technology. 
  The primary implement in modern digging work is the 
shield-tunneling machine. Used to dig deep underground tunnels, 
they are known as ``gigantic moles.'' These excavating behemoths 
spiral out in all directions at the construction sites of 
subways, underground flood-control ponds and undersea tunnels. 
Japanese shield machines were used in the construction of the 
English Channel tunnel. 
  The greater underground chambers have become, the larger 
these moles have grown. The latest models weigh in at 3,000 
tons, are 14 m high and 14 m wide. 
  The world's largest shield-tunneling machine with a diameter 
of 14.14 m was completed at the Kanagawa Works of Hitachi Zosen 
Corp. on Nov. 11. It will be delivered to a joint venture of 
Kumagai Gumi Co., Hazama Corp. and JDC Corp. to be used in the 
construction of the Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway linking Chiba 
Prefecture and the metropolis. 
  The huge machine is equipped with a device which 
automatically assembles 11 segments, each weighing 10 tons, in a 
circle in about 90 minutes. 
  The previous heavyweight title-holder was a 13.94 
meter-diameter mole developed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. 
This machine has been used since last February by the Tokyo 
Metropolitan Government to carve out a pond about 50 m 
underground in Suginami Ward for flood control of the Kanda 
River. 
  Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Kajima Corp. worked together 
to 
develop the automatic assembly machine mounted on the Kanda 
River mole. This has allowed remote-control assembly by workers 
and on-site engineers are no longer needed for the task. 
  Kawasaki Heavy Industries also engaged in the development of 
some of the eight shield-tunneling machines for the Trans-Tokyo 
Bay Highway project. Though the difference in the diameter of 
the world's large machines and their predecessor is only 20 cm, 
the new machines are 50&percnt; better in performance, according 
to a 
Kawasaki official. 
  The latest machines can automatically assemble a ring of 
10-ton segments in about 100 minutes, while it takes the Kanda 
River mole two hours and 40 minutes to assemble its 7.4-ton 
segments. The digging speed has also been improved from 2 cm per 
minute to 3 cm per minute. The capacity of the jack has been 
raised by 20&percnt;. Accordingly, the price and weight of the 
machines have also risen. 
  The next model of shield-tunnel machines will have a 
diameter 
of 16 m, according to a Hitachi Zosen official.

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroshi Yano, Tadao Akashi, and Takayuki Kohama </F>
of the Metal Forming Engineering Division, Toyota Motor 
Corporation; MS received 12 May 93] 
  [Text] Auto manufacturers rely on computers to provide 
superior motor vehicles at lower prices, thus meeting the needs 
of society and responding rapidly to market demands. In the 
forging of parts as well, the application of computers (CAE) 
began in the field of CAD and CAM, and has now expanded into 
analytical simulation. 
  This paper introduces the application of CAE to forged part 
design. First, we introduce a comprehensive two-dimensional 
forging process design support system, FESTE, which Toyota Motor 
Corporation has successfully developed in-house. Secondly, the 
current topics of CAE application, such as three-dimensional 
parts simulation and automatic three-dimensional modeling, are 
described. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The production of automobile forged parts is characterized 
by 
the fact that a wide variety of such parts are produced in large 
quantities. So during the production preparation process, the 
efficient use of computers is indispensable. 
  The application of computers to forging in our company began 
with CAD and CAM, and has now expanded to analytical simulation. 
In this report, CAE denotes comprehensive computer-aided 
support, including CAD, CAM and simulation. 
  This report introduces a comprehensive design process 
support 
system, FESTE, developed with forging simulation techniques as 
its nucleus, and refers to examples of CAE application to forged 
part design. 
<H5>  2. Purpose of Forging CAE </H5>
  Forging process design used to depend largely on the 
know-how, or empirical rules, of expert designers. Before making 
the final decision for mass-production, the conventional method 
was to repeat designs and test on a trial-and-error basis. There 
is increasing demand for better quality raw materials, more 
precise shapes and the use of light alloy, and a special need in 
the preparatory stage of such production is to shorten the lead 
time, the time from development to mass-production. Hence the 
requirement for a more active role of CAE. Figure 1 shows the 
flow of the design process with CAE. The following paragraphs 
describe the purpose of introducing CAE into practical design 
work. 
  a) Reduction of test frequency: This is achieved through 
simulation experiments to screen proposed designs. 
  b) Efficient procedure of the design process: Design work 
itself improved via computerized automation. 
  c) Better quality: Designer fully uses CAE to develop high 
value forging parts. 
  d) Cost reduction: Cost for die production and test are 
reduced as a result of better design. 
  e) Single-source data control: To use common data in 
CAD/CAE/CAM can shorten the time from design to mass-production. 



<H5>  3. Two-Dimensional Forging Process Design Support System </H5>
  3.1. Features and General Description of FESTE, 
Two-Dimensional Forging Process Design Support System 
  Even in the case of symmetrical parts, such as transmission 
gears, it is becoming more and more difficult to get the best 
production design within a short period, based solely on 
empirical rules. Hence, FESTE is designed to form a simple 
system, available for die designers themselves, to run 
simulation, and automatically following a standardized die 
design process. FESTE has the following features: a) easy 
operation; b) high analytical precision; c) time-saving 
procedures; d) short time requirement and e) single-source data 
control. 
  3.2. Forging Rigid-Plastic FEM Simulator 
  The features of the simulator, which stands at the center of 
the FESTE system, are as follows. 
  (1) Rigid-plastic finite element method 
  The rigid-plastic finite element method (FEM) is a method of 
numerical analysis where the subject material is treated as a 
rigid-plastic body, so elastic deformation of the materials may 
be ignored. Among the advantages of this method are that errors 
attributable to stress do not accumulate, it permits greater 
deformation per step, and strain rate sensitivity can be 
considered in the design. Due to these advantages, it provides a 
practical means of analysis which has a rapid calculation 
ability in the case of extensive plastic deformation, as occurs 
in forging. 
  Hence, we adopted a theory (1) based on the compression 
characteristics method, which is free from theoretical 
contradictions in yielding conditions, stress and the like. 
  (2) Database 
  In practical use of the simulation system, two factors play 
a 
key role, the way the database (DB) is used, and its precision. 
The database consists of: 1) material characteristics DB; and 2) 
tool-to-material friction conditions DB. The material 
characteristics are approximated according to the following 
expression: 
&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The material characteristics DB is expressed by a matrix of 
the nature of materials with temperature, which classifies the 
values, a, b, n and m. The tool-to-material friction conditions 
DB is a matrix of the processing method with temperature, in 
which the friction coefficient &mgr; obtained from Coulomb 
friction is classified. We have succeeded in expressing vast 
amounts of our experimental data and previous expertise 
numerically, which makes it possible to use the most appropriate 
database for practical analysis conditions. 
  (3) Output of analysis results 
  The information which designers must obtain from analysis 
includes: 1) deformed profile; 2) cavity filling; 3) stroke vs. 
load curve; 4) die pressure distribution; 5) stress distribution 
(e.g., equivalent stress and stresses in respective directions); 
and 6) strain distribution (e.g., equivalent strain and strains 
in respective directions). 
  Figure 2 shows the results of the forming simulation of a 
forged transmission gear, including the results of analysis of 
deformed profile, equivalent strain distribution and die 
pressure distribution. 



  3.3. Example of System Application 
  The example given here is the system applied to the design 
process of forged raw materials for a transmission gear, in a 
closed forging process using a high-speed automatic press 
(Figure 3). As shown in Figure 4, the raw materials are 
generally worked into final shape from cut materials in three to 
four steps. 







    (1) Determination of forged material shape 
  The forged material shape is determined with the aid of 
two-dimensional CAD based on the forged material shape data, to 
which machining stock removal and die draft angle are added, 
considering the best possible forging method with reference to 
the CAD database of shape of parts determined at our development 
division (Figure 5). 



  (2) Consideration of process plan 
  In forging generally, several processes should be 
considered. 
It is conventional to rely on empirical know-how in screening 
proposed designs. FESTE makes it possible to judge the design 
based on simulation, so all the designer has to do is to draft 
on CAD more than one plan with different volume distributions 
(Figure 6). 



  (3) FEM data preparation 
  Process data prepared with CAD are automatically converted 
into FEM analysis data. Process drawing data for the second 
process, for example, is converted into pre-forming material 
shape data for use in FEM analysis and the third process data 
into upper and lower tool shape data for the same purpose 
(Figure 7). 



  For material forming, the best element division is 
automatically accomplished with reference to the element 
division database in consideration of tool shape and working 
method. Further, once the type of forming material and the press 
to be used are specified, FEM data are completed. 
  Moreover, apart from the preparation of process plans with 
CAD, the forming material shape can be freely converted with the 
use of shape parameters, which provide a simple means of 
considering the design assuming different dimensions (Figure 8). 



  (4) Execution of FEM analysis 
  FEM analysis is executed on EWS, which are exclusively used 
by CAE, in about 10 minutes. 
  The results of analysis are controlled as a database, 
classified by type of part, to allow designers to refer to past 
analysis results on similar parts. 
  (5) Evaluation of analysis results 
  Analysis results provide designers with information as to 
forming load, die pressure, cavity filling and others, which 
allow them to make a comprehensive judgment. Figure 9 shows the 
results of a comparison of cavity filling between plans A and B. 
In plan A, as the material deformed, it filled the outer 
portion. This implies the possibility that flash could develop 
if the material penetrated into the clearance between upper and 
lower tools as work proceeds. In plan B, however, filling turned 
out to be uniform and well-balanced until the final stage. With 
consideration given to other factors as well, such as forming 
load, plan B was adopted for mass-production. 



  Furthermore, using elastic FEM software, dies are evaluated 
for strength based on the results of analyzed die pressure 
distribution (Figure 10). 



  Should problems be found with process plans during this 
stage, designers return to steps (1) and (2), and seek again the 
best process design on computer. 
  (6) Automatic drafting of die, assembly, and process drawing 
  This is done based on the process data used for simulation. 
  Although die design work was standardized to a large extent, 
it used to take a great deal of time because of the great number 
of dies to be designed. FESTE picks up the process data on CAD 
described in (5), and works automatically to submit the design 
of the best die division, details and installation jigs, 
automatically printing out process and die design, and die 
assembly drawings. Figure 11 shows a die assembly drawing thus 
automatically designed. 



  (7) Die manufacturing 
  NC data are prepared based on die manufacturing data, 
subsequently initiating die manufacturing. After inspection, the 
die is tested on an actual press, before proceeding with 
mass-production. 
  3.4. System Evaluation 
  Test results agreed very well with simulation results from 
FESTE and no problems occurred in mass-production. The support 
system shortened design time to one quarter that of conventional 
design. Owing to the high precision of the improved design 
process, the frequency of tests required is reduced, and lead 
time has been greatly shortened. 
<H5>  4. CAE for Three-Dimensional Forging Parts </H5>
  4.1. Three-Dimensional Simulation Technique 
  Many problems remain to be solved in the analysis of 
three-dimensional parts, such as increased calculation time, and 
the establishment of automatic division techniques into element 
and tool definition methods. At present, this type of analysis 
is performed with nearly axially symmetrical parts. Figure 12 
shows the results of three-dimensional analysis for extrusion of 
an inner spline extrusion.&lt;sup&gt; (2)&lt;/sup&gt; 



  4.2. Automatic Modeling System 
  Although it is now difficult to simulate specially shaped 
parts with three dimensions, automatic process design, based on 
parameter input, and the automatic three-dimensional modeling 
system, can be employed for the parts for which the design 
process is standardized. With dimension parameters input as 
parts data, this system automatically calculates stock removal, 
draft angle and other requirements, and formed out forging 
process design including preforming design, to automatically 
draw up a model in three dimensions. The expertise of die 
designers is incorporated in this design process, making it 
possible to generate the desired forging process as 
three-dimensional data. Figure 13 shows the results of automatic 
three-dimensional modeling of a connecting rod using this 
support system and the cutter location obtained from the data 
used. It is clear from this diagram that three-dimensional 
modeling work time, which used to be very long, is shortened and 
that the system reduces the time for design work, significantly 
reducing lead time. 



<H5>  5. Conclusions </H5>
  This report introduced the practical application of 
two-dimensional CAE to the forging of automobile parts and the 
current state of development of the three-dimensional system at 
Toyota Motor Corporation. The recent expansion of CAE 
application was made possible by rapid progress in computer 
technology, the strong need for such a system from the very 
beginning of research, and strenuous efforts in its development. 
  In the future it should achieve drastic work transformation, 
following the concept of concurrent engineering, which 
encompasses in its scope all the design stages, from design to 
production, based on CAE.

<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Optical fiber cables carry extremely high volumes of 
information with little attenuation. They have such advantages 
as being free of electromagnetic interference, thin in diameter, 
light, and energy efficient. Therefore, they are viewed as one 
of the greatest inventions of the twentieth century as a 
transmission medium to support the information-oriented society. 
Although optical fiber cables were unimagined just twenty-five 
years ago, their stunning development and progress have begun to 
virtually replace the old copper wire communication cables 
technology which has sustained a one hundred year history. 
  Serious development of optical fibers began in 1970. The 
initial stage was experimental research, then there was a series 
of failures under actual environmental conditions. 
Characteristic failures included: 
  1. Increased attenuation due to hydrogen. 
  2. Fiber breakage. 
  3. Eccentric cores. 
  4. Separation of glass and resin due to water penetration 
Increased attenuation. 
  5. Increased attenuation due to bubbles in coating layers. 
  6. Difficulty in splicing because of lowered adhesion 
between 
glass and coating layers. 
  7. Difficulty in splicing because of increased jacket 
stripping force. 
  Many research projects for improvement were launched on the 
basis of these failures. Today, both functionality and quality 
have reached near perfection. 
  This paper introduces: 
  1. The present state of functionality and quality; 
  2. The trends of productivity and cost efficiency; 
  3. Fulfilling the needs of the market. 
  I hope this paper will be a contributive reference for the 
application and expansion of optical fiber cables. 
<H5>  2. Research and Development </H5>
<H5>  (1) Improved Functionality </H5>
  One of the major characteristics of optical fibers is their 
large information-carrying capacity. Most of the current 
transmission systems employing optical fibers use a method of 
sending light pulses as a signal. The information carrying 
capacity is determined by the duration of the interval between 
the light pulses. When pulses are sent over long distances, they 
expand and overlap adjacent pulses, and become undistinguishable 
upon reception. This expansion of pulses is called dispersion. 
There are the following types of dispersion: 
  1. Modal dispersion; 
  2. Waveguide dispersion; 
  3. Material dispersion. 
  As Figure 1 shows, in the case of light injected into fibers 
with comparatively large diameters, there is a wide variety of 
light ray components, from the component that is propagated 
along the interface of the core and the cladding while being 
totally reflected repeatedly, to the component that is 
propagated along the center of the core and experiences 
practically no total reflection. These components exist 
discretely, and each one is called a mode. The delay time is 
different for each mode. This is the cause of the spreading of 
pulses in the case of multi-mode fibers, in which one pulse 
consists of many modes. By utilizing the refractive index 
dependence of light velocity, the graded index (GI) fiber was 
developed. In this fiber, the mode dispersion is cancelled by 
making the refractive index in the center of the core high and 
the refractive index on the periphery low. However, as it is 
impossible to completely eliminate pulse spreading due to modal 
dispersion, there is a tendency to deviate from use of this 
fiber. When the core diameter is made sufficiently small, a 
condition is formed where these modes are unable to exist except 
for one. In the single mode fiber, which was designed with this 
condition, there is in principle no pulse spreading due to modal 
dispersion, and so transmission at an extremely high bit rate 
became possible. At present, virtually all communications fibers 
are of this type. Even this single mode fiber has limitations on 
its information-carrying capacity. The reason for this is pulse 
spreading due to material dispersion and waveguide dispersion. 
The cause of pulse spreading due to these two kinds of 
dispersion is that delay time is dependent on wavelength. This 
dependence of delay time on wavelength is relative to 
alterations in glass composition and distribution of refractive 
index. Even when a laser diode is used as the light source, the 
light does not oscillate on a single wavelength, but is composed 
of a plurality of wavelengths. Therefore, pulse spreading occurs 
due to differences in the delay time of each wavelength. To 
minimize this pulse spreading, the center of the wavelengths of 
the light source should be made to reach the maximum point on a 
graph of the relationship of light velocity to wavelength. This 
is illustrated in Figure 2. The maximum point is called the 
zero-dispersion wavelength. Currently, the most widely used 
light source wavelength for single mode fibers is the 1.3 &mgr; 
band. The zero-dispersion wavelength of fibers used is also 1.3 
&mgr;, the same as that of the light source wavelength. 







    Recently, use of a transmission system has begun which 
employs the 1.55&mgr; band, in which the attenuation of optical 
fibers is lowest. Also, by increasing the difference in 
refractive indices between the core and the cladding, and 
reducing the core diameter, the fiber whose zero-dispersion 
wavelength is shifted to 1.55 &mgr;, called the dispersion 
shifted 
fiber, was developed and is now in use. This system was first 
used by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) of Japan. A 
repeaterless transmission was realized by ocean cable over the 
120 km distance from Matsuyama to Oita. This cable was installed 
in 1988 with an information carrying capacity of 1.6 Gbps. 
Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) plans to use the dispersion shifted 
fiber in a cable (TPC-5) to be laid in 1995-1996 on the floor of 
the Pacific Ocean. The use of recently developed optical fiber 
amplification technology is also planned for this system. KDD 
plans to send 5 Gbps signals of light over a distance of 9,500 
km with no conversion of light into electricity, relaying it 
with optical fiber amplifiers. 
  Another distinguished characteristic of optical fibers is 
their attenuation. The major component of the glass used to make 
optical fibers is SiO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; . As shown in Figure 3, the 
manufacturing methods include the modified-chemical vapor 
deposition (MCVD) method in which the raw material of 
SiCl&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt;  is vaporized and oxidized, and the outside 
vapor deposition (OVD) method and vapor-phase axial deposition 
(VAD) method, in which hydrolytic dissociation is performed in 
the flame of a burner. In each method, because the core and 
cladding are produced while rotating, there is, in principle, no 
eccentricity of the core, but actually, the core sometimes 
becomes eccentric when glass rods are connected at each end for 
handling. For this reason, total inspection of the core 
eccentricity is conducted. 



  The vapor pressure of SiCl&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; , the raw material of 
optical fibers, is much larger than that of salts of 
transitional metals, which induce increased attenuation. 
Therefore, it is easy to eliminate transitional metal 
impurities. However, as the raw material can be adulterated with 
SiHCl&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt;  or with moisture due to leaks into the raw 
material supply pipes, OH groups become incorporated in the 
glass. These OH groups absorb light, inducing worsened 
attenuation. In the VAD method, which was developed in Japan, 
because glass is synthesized by hydrolytic dissociation of the 
raw material in a flame, there is in principle much adulteration 
with OH groups. Therefore, undertaking the development of 
technology to remove OH groups after glass synthesis, success 
was ultimately achieved with the use of chlorine to remove 
hydrogen. After the removal of OH groups, the causes of 
attenuation are Rayleigh scattering, which has a larger effect 
at short wavelengths, and molecular vibrational absorption of 
Si-O, which has a larger effect at long wavelengths. Rayleigh 
scattering is dependent on the concentration of the dopant in 
the core. For the formation of refractive index distribution, 
usually germanium is added to the core to increase the 
refractive index. In contrast, fluorine may be added to the 
cladding to reduce the refractive index. Rayleigh scattering is 
suppressed by making the core of pure SiO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  because 
of no dopant in the core. Japan has developed the fluorine 
dopant technology and has realized the pure silica core single 
mode fiber in which attenuation is further reduced by 
10-15&percnt;. 
These fibers were used in 1992 in the second trans-Pacific 
optical fiber cable (TPC-4). 
  As in the previous description, dispersion shifted fibers 
have attained the limit for information-carrying capacity, and 
pure silica core fibers the limit for attenuation. Figure 4 
shows an attenuation-wavelengthcurve for a typical optical fiber 
and the causes of that attenuation. 



  Optical fibers are made of glass. Glass is well known as a 
fragile material. Therefore, ever since the early stages of 
optical fiber development, research has been conducted on ways 
to maintain their strength. Glass is strong to begin with; its 
fragility is due to the fact that there are cracks on its 
surface. Optical fibers are produced drawing the molten glass 
preform. In this process, optical fibers are coated with resin 
to protect their surface before it can touch a hard object, so 
that the optical fiber retains its original degree of strength. 
This technology was also invented in Japan. Figure 3(d) shows 
the concept of the drawing machine. Because the adhesion of 
foreign substances to the surface of a fiber weakens its 
strength, cleanliness is also emphasized in the fiber 
manufacturing process not only for attenuation but also for 
strength. Because it is in reality impossible to achieve 
100&percnt; 
cleanliness, weak spots are intentionally broken with a certain 
tensile load that is applied beforehand, so that the weak areas 
are not shipped. This process is called screening. 
  On the one hand, when hard resin is used as the coating 
material, the fiber receives minute bends when a non-uniform 
lateral pressure is applied, increasing attenuation. On the 
other hand, soft resin is unable to fulfill the role of 
protecting the surface of the fiber. Therefore, the resin for 
coating has a two-layer structure, composed of a soft resin 
which protects the fiber, and outside this is a hard resin which 
protects that soft resin. Atop this, for the purpose of 
distinction, color is applied with ink. When foreign particles 
become stuck on in the coating process, the outside diameter 
becomes larger in spots, so that bends arise in fibers when they 
are combined as cables, increasing attenuation. Several colored 
fibers are lined up side by side and covered with resin. This 
resin layer is called ribbon coating. The structure is shown in 
Figure 5. When the ribbonized fibers are separated, the ribbon 
coating is removed. But if the ink sticks to the ribbon coating 
at this time and is stripped, it becomes impossible to 
distinguish the fibers; so countermeasures for this must be also 
considered. 



  On the one hand, if the adhesion between the soft resin and 
the glass is high, the coating cannot be stripped away cleanly 
at the time of splicing. On the other hand, if there is no 
adhesion, difficulties arise when the ribbon fibers are spliced. 
The fibers and the coating will slip after the coated resin at 
the ends of the fibers is stripped, and when the ribbon is held 
at the resin part, because the length of the extrusion of the 
fibers is not uniform splicing is impossible, as shown in Figure 
6. The degree of adhesion, therefore, must be controlled to 
satisfy these two conditions. Coating strippability is also 
related to Young's modulus. This is shown in Figure 7. 







    The prevention of generating air bubbles in coating layers 
is 
also important. When there are many air bubbles, bends arise in 
the fiber due to non-uniform stress. This increases attenuation. 
Especially at low temperatures, the Young's modulus of the resin 
increases, and the difference in thermal contraction between the 
glass and the resin can produce a large stress, increasing 
attenuation. The generation of air bubbles is prevented by 
revising the die structure and by process parameter control, 
such as resin temperature. An on-line air bubble sensor has also 
been developed. 
  Consequently, the materials used to coat the glass are also 
important. We can observe that many kinds of studies have been 
made from every angle up to the present time. 
<H5>  (2) Improvement in Quality </H5>
  As in the description in part (1), the functionality of 
optical fibers has reached its limits. The next step would be to 
produce optical fibers without variance in this functionality so 
as to ship them with assurance, and to prevent loss of 
functionality after shipping. Group activities by production 
technicians for improvement have been very effective for 
reducing variance in production. Control of the purity of the 
gas used and leak checking in the supply pipes are important for 
low attenuation. Because alteration of the distribution of the 
refractive index causes the variance of the mode field diameter 
(power distribution of the light to be propagated in the fiber), 
the cutoff wavelength (wavelength limit in which single mode 
propagation is possible) and the zero-dispersion wavelength, 
inspection is conducted at the preform stage, and feedback is 
made if there are any abnormalities. Especially in the steps 
after glass synthesis from fiber formation to coating, 
cleanliness control in the manufacturing process is important 
for strength. 
  It is also essential that characteristics of fibers remain 
unchanged for many years after cables are laid. If hydrogen is 
dissolved in the glass, attenuation increases because of light 
absorption by hydrogen molecules. Origins of this hydrogen 
include the decomposition of resin used as the coating material 
and the oxidation of metals used to form the cable. As 
countermeasures, resin which produces little hydrogen is used, 
and oxidation-resistant metals are used to plate the metals 
used. Also, if defects exist in the Si-O network within the 
glass, hydrogen reacts with these defects, increasing 
attenuation even further. Therefore, it is also important that 
no defects be formed in the glass network in the glass synthesis 
process. Figure 8 shows the spectral attenuation of a fiber in 
which attenuation is increased by hydrogen. 



  Quartz glass is water dissolvable. Its dissolution is 
accelerated by tensile force applied to the fiber. The fibers 
are stranded in the cable, and receive a slight amount of 
tensile force. Water vapor in the cables causes the gradual 
growth of cracks on the surface of the optical fiber, so that 
finally, breakage can occur as a result of a small tensile 
force. Breakage lifetime depends on original strength of the 
fiber, the tensile force that is applied to it, and a value 
n expressing the speed of crack growth. The value 
n is a numberthat is determined experimentally from 
the relationship between the tensile force applied to a fiber 
and the breakage lifetime. It depends on temperature and 
humidity. Figure 9 shows one example of the relationship between 
tensile force applied to a fiber and the breakage lifetime. The 
slope of the curve is the value n. The strength of a 
fiber decreases even in a state without load stress; the speed 
of this decrease in strength depends on the kind of resin used 
for the coating. 



  The properties of resin change when it is exposed to 
humidity 
or ultraviolet light. This process can lead to changes in the 
characteristics of fiber. First, the color of the resin yellows 
due to ultraviolet light, making distinction difficult. Since it 
has been found that fibers may change in color when stored for a 
long period of time in a warehouse with fluorescent lamps, 
countermeasures have been taken. It has also been observed that 
adhesion may change between glass and coating layer due to 
humidity, and bubbles appear within the coating layer. Bubbles 
which exist within the coating layer from the start also grow, 
causing problems. With the increase in the number of fibers used 
in high-fiber-count cables, cable splicing requires more time, 
causing the fibers to be exposed directly to rain or humidity in 
manholes. In extreme cases, the manholes can be flooded. In such 
cases, the humidity resistance of resin is important. Changes in 
adhesion are considered to be caused by breakage of the hydrogen 
bonds between the glass and the resin by water. This is shown in 
Figure 10. Adhesion is scrupulously controlled in the fiber 
manufacturing process, but when this adhesion changes due to 
humidity, problems occur at the time of cable connection. The 
appearance and growth of bubbles within the coating cause 
micro-bends of fiber, which affect attenuation. Bubbles at the 
glass-resin interface are especially important factors in 
attenuation. 



  The resin used for fiber coating has been developed with the 
above points in mind, and resin has been developed in which the 
kinds of problems observed earlier do not arise. Table 1 is an 
example of the results of underwater, high temperature or high 
humidity conditions accelerated degradation tests. When a fiber 
is left in water at 100&deg;C for 16 hours, delamination may 
occur between the glass and the soft resin, and bubbles appear. 
As a result, attenuation increases. Also, when a fiber is left 
for four months at 95&percnt; humidity and 60&deg;C, the 
stripping 
force may change, making connection difficult. Leaving a fiber 
at the low temperature of -40&deg;C may also increase 
attenuation. When a fiber is left under water for six months, it 
is possible that the fiber's strength decreases. These phenomena 
depend on the type of resin used for coating. By selecting an 
appropriate type of resin, strength reduction can be prevented.

  At present, resins have been developed that show practically 
no deterioration under these extremely severe experimental 
conditions. Optical fiber cables have become highly reliable. 
<H5>  3. Production Methods </H5>
<H5>  (3) Improvement in Productivity </H5>
  As the price drop in the optical fiber market has been 
remarkable, it is natural that every maker is concentrating on 
increasing productivity. The main factors that determine 
productivity are speed of glass synthesis, drawing speed, and 
preform size. In 1989, it was reported that the speed of glass 
synthesis was 9 g/min by the OVD method of Corning, and the 
preform size was 90 km/preform. These values were slightly 
higher with Japan's VAD method. A glass synthesis speed of 20 
g/min at the laboratory by the VAD method has been reported. The 
drawing speed of 1,200 m/min is also the highest that has been 
reported. 
  In the VAD method, improvements have been made to the 
structure of the burner for flame hydrolysis in order to 
increase the speed of synthesis. When drawing speed increases in 
the drawing process, coating resin is applied to hot fibers, and 
the resin decomposes. To avoid this, it is necessary to 
sufficiently cool the fibers after they emerge from the drawing 
furnace and before they enter the coating die, therefore, the 
distance is lengthened from the drawing furnace to the coating 
die. Drawing towers that are twenty meters or more in height are 
also being considered for this. In response to high speed 
drawing, technology has been developed to apply pressure to the 
resin inside the die that will be used to coat fibers, and high 
resin curing speed has been achieved. In the early development 
of optical fibers, thermosetting silicone resin, which is 
extremely stable chemically, was used. But more recently, to 
increase the drawing speed, UV-light curable resin is more 
common because of its very high curing speed. To advance the 
curing speed even further, high-power UV lamps have been 
developed. 
<H5>  (4) Cost Reduction </H5>
  The cost of optical fibers includes indirect expenses such 
as 
the cost of research in addition to expenses for raw materials, 
personnel, and facilities. Since SiCl&lt;inf&gt; 4&lt;/inf&gt; , the raw 
material of the glass, is a byproduct of the production of 
silicon for semiconductor devices from the raw material of 
SiHCl&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; , refining and transportation compose most of 
the raw material expenses for the glass. However, the 
requirements for the resin material to be used in coating are 
stringent, as written in the explanation in section 2, and this 
kind of resin is not produced in as large a quantity as other 
plastics, so it is quite costly. The cost of gases such as 
oxygen, hydrogen, and helium and the cost of electricity are 
also high. Personnel expenses per unit length of fiber during 
the manufacturing process are relatively low because of 
increased productivity, as in the description in section (3). 
However, as inspection items are added for quality improvement, 
the expenses in this aspect remain high. Facility expenses have 
decreased somewhat due to increased productivity, but there are 
also factors increasing facility expenses, such as the 
enlargement of machines, factory automation, and the 
installation of sensors for quality improvement. Facility 
expenses do not necessarily decrease in direct correlation to 
increased productivity. 
<H5>  4. Market Needs </H5>
<H5>  (5) Increase in Types of Cable Structure </H5>
  There are many types of optical fiber cable structures, 
depending upon the applications. Since different types of cables 
are used overseas, the number of types is further increased. 
First, the cables used domestically will be discussed. Cable 
structures can be explained by looking at the number of fibers 
included in one cable. There are single-fiber cables in which 
one fiber is housed in one cable. These generally have a 
structure in which strengthening materials and jacket are 
applied to the inner fiber. For cables of up to about 12 fibers, 
a layer type is used in which fibers are stranded around a 
strength member. Up to about 48 fibers, a unit structure is used 
in which units of eight fibers are stranded with each other and 
then further stranded around a strength member. In cables of one 
hundred fibers, a grooved spacer structure is used in which five 
4-fiber ribbons are housed in each groove of a spacer with five 
grooves. 
  In an era in which optical fibers reach each house, as many 
fibers as houses go out from the telephone office, necessitating 
the use of high-fiber-count cables. The highest fiber count in 
cables currently laid is 1,000, and the diameter of this 
1,000-fiber cable is just 40 mm. Eight-fiber ribbon is used in 
this cable. This is shown in Figure 11. In the slotted core type 
cable, water-swelling tape is used for protection against water 
entry. At present, the development of super high-count cable 
with higher fiber count is under way. The structure of these 
cables use stranded units of ten 16-fiber ribbons. Cables of up 
to 4,000 fibers are being considered. This is shown in Figure 12. 







    Ocean cables are laid at depths reaching several thousand 
meters from cable laying ships, so they receive large tensile 
forces. The water pressure they are subject to after being laid 
is also very large. In the structure used by KDD, the fiber 
units are encased in three divisions of steel shells to make 
them resistant to that tensile force and water pressure, and 
steel wires are stranded around these. This is covered with a 
copper tube, which transmits electrical power, and on top of 
that, two layers of polyethylene, low-density polyethylene and 
high-density polyethylene, are used to block seawater. To combat 
any water penetration, a compound to prevent the spreading of 
water is used to fill the area between the steel components. 
This is shown in Figure 13. 



  The special feature of optical fibers is that they are not 
subject to electromagnetic interference. Therefore, it is 
possible to construct composite fiber-optic power cables, in 
which optical fibers are included in power cables. It is also 
possible to lay optical fibers parallel to high-voltage power 
cables that are laid along steel towers. Composite fiber-optic 
overhead ground wires are widely used at present. Here, overhead 
ground wires laid parallel to power cables are used as pipes, 
and optical fibers are encased inside these pipes. 
  Overseas, the loose tube cable is the standard. The fibers 
are inserted into a tube, and the tube is then filled with a 
jelly to prevent water permeation. Caution must be exercised 
because the jelly may erode the resin used for coating. 
<H5>  (6) Production Capacity and Delivery Times </H5>
  In 1992, 2.46 million kilometers of optical fiber were 
produced in Japan (from a survey by The Japanese Electric Wire 
and Cable Makers' Association). In a plan by NTT, B-ISDN is to 
be constructed and optical fibers are to be laid to every 
household by the year 2015. There are reports that this plan may 
be postponed because of falling income levels at NTT, but it is 
clear that even if the plan is delayed two or three years, many 
fibers will be necessary. The companies involved will have 
sufficient production capacity to fully respond to those future 
needs. The preparation of such a production system will also 
result in shorter delivery times from ordering to shipment. 
<H5>  (7) Development of Related Technologies </H5>
<H5>  1. Fusion Splicing </H5>
  To join optical fibers, the ends of the fibers are cleaved 
to 
mirror surfaces, and then aligned and fusion spliced with 
heating by electrical discharge. In the case of single mode 
fibers, the core diameter is extremely small, at only 8 &mgr;, 
and 
it is necessary for the fibers to be aligned as precisely as 
possible. For this alignment, the sides of the fibers are 
illuminated, and their position is thereby confirmed for proper 
alignment during splicing. Confirmation of core position is 
conducted automatically through image processing based on 
information from a CCD camera. At present, the loss due to 
splicing is at the extremely low level of 0.03 dB. 
  To join ultrahigh-fiber-count cables, fiber by fiber 
splicing 
would take an immense amount of time. Therefore, a technology 
has been developed whereby fiber ribbons are joined all at once. 
For this mass fusion splicing technique, it is necessary that 
each fiber that is to be spliced should be heated identically 
with electrical discharge energy. It is set so that all the 
fibers in a ribbon are placed in the position where the energy 
is uniformly distributed. This is shown in Figure 14. In this 
method, ribbons of up to sixteen fibers can be simultaneously 
spliced. 



  A fully automatic fusion splicer is being developed. This 
machine will automatically conduct operations from jacket 
removing to reinforcing after splicing. When use of this fusion 
splicer is begun, splicing will be possible at about four times 
the speed of conventional splicing machines. The industry is 
looking forward to this machine as it will create great labor 
savings and shorten training time as well. 
<H5>  2. Connectors </H5>
  Even with the development of a fusion splicer that can 
handle 
sixteen fibers at once, quite a long time is needed to splice 
ultrahigh-fiber-count cables such as those that encase four 
thousand fibers. Even with the fully automatic fiber splicer, 
calculations show that it would take a full day to splice cables 
of this type. Therefore, discussions are being held regarding 
the development of high-count-fiber connectors. Thefiber count 
in a connector so far developed is sixteen. The connectors line 
up the cores of mating fibers by inserting two pins called 
guide-pins into the guide-holes on both sides of the fiber 
ribbon. The accuracy of the alignment is within 1 &mgr;, and the 
loss due to splicing has reached an average level of 0.2 dB. The 
structure of the connector is shown in Figure 15. The 
development of eighty-fiber connectors is also in progress. 
There are two methods: one in which eighty fibers are lined up 
in one row, and the other in which sixteen fiber connectors are 
arranged in five vertical rows. Taking two minutes as the 
connecting time for one connector, the joining time of four 
thousand fibers cables would be just one hundred minutes. 



<H5>  3. Surveillance System for Optical Fiber Network </H5>
  Along with progress in the deployment of optical 
communications systems, the effects of accidents involving 
optical fiber cables breakage will become extremely serious. 
Conventionally, nitrogen gas was sealed inside a cable at a 
certain pressure, and accidents were detected by monitoring this 
gas pressure. However, to suppress costs the gas-pressurized 
cable system has been abandoned, and instead, attenuation is 
measured periodically. When attenuation increase is detected, it 
is necessary to switch immediately to spare fibers. NTT has 
developed the system shown in Figure 16. In this system, light 
of a different wavelength from the signal light wavelength is 
used to measure the attenuation of a fiber in use. 



  The optical components used in this system include a coupler 
that combines light of two different wavelengths and a fiber 
selecting switch that is used to launch the measuring light into 
each fiber sequentially. The coupler is made with the technique 
of fiber fusing. The switch is composed of the mechanically 
movable master connector and the connector arrays opposed to the 
master connector. However, it is hoped that a non-mechanical 
switch will be developed in the future. To reflect the measuring 
light at the end of the fiber under test, a filter is installed 
which passes the signal light through but causes the measuring 
light to reflect. The switch to a spare fiber, in case any 
abnormality is detected, is made by a mechanical optical switch. 
  As optical fibers become more and more widespread, to 
construct an accurate data base of information regarding optical 
fiber networks that is necessary for cable maintenance and 
management, including manufacturing data, characteristics of 
transmission, installation date, placed location, and data on 
spliced lines, automatic renewal of the current manual 
collection processes is being considered by NTT. This would 
enable the quick selection of idle fibers for new subscribers 
and quick switching from lines with problems to idle lines. The 
main components for the system are the connector with memory, 
the local controller (LCTR) (a simple transmitter with 
microprocessor) which sends information from this memory to a 
central workstation, and appropriate optical fibers. The 
connector with memory is used when joining optical cables in a 
manhole; when joining the connectors, the memory chips on the 
connectors are also fixed on the printed circuit board (PCB). 
The LCTR gathers information from the memory chips through the 
PCB and sends the information to the workstation at the 
telephone office viaappropriate fibers. The system structure is 
shown in Figure 17. 



<H5>  5. Summary </H5>
  Since the latter half of the 1970's optical fibers have been 
made into cables and laid on site. In the meantime, trouble of 
various kinds has occurred in the factory and on site, and 
improvements have been made in response to these problems. At 
present, almost all of the problems have been exhausted, and it 
seems that the industry has neared the point of perfection in 
creating countermeasures for these problems. With their 
excellent reliability, these optical fibers will be laid on a 
global scale in the future. As a result, it is expected that a 
high level information society will be realized with various 
services available at a low cost, and that a number of new 
industries will be established in relation to this achievement.

  [Text] About a year ago, Japan aroused international 
controversy by shipping reprocessed plutonium from France. Now 
the nation is about to join the ranks of plutonium users, with a 
fast-breeder reactor in western Japan scheduled to reach 
criticality early next year. 
  It is against this backdrop that Japan faces the idea of 
placing plutonium storage and use under international control. 
  Of all nuclear-energy sources, plutonium is feared because 
of 
its potential use in nuclear weapons. Even where a nation 
intends to use the substance for peaceful purposes only, it is 
important to make the utilization process sufficiently open to 
leave no room for international suspicions. 
  Another effective way to curb nuclear proliferation is for 
user countries to refrain from holding more plutonium than is 
necessary for power generation and other non-military uses. 
  Worldwide plutonium stocks are estimated by Japan's Atomic 
Energy Commission at 911 metric tons, 257 tons for military 
purposes and 654 tons for civilian. Of the civilian-use 
holdings, 532 tons are in the form of spent fuel, while 
reprocessed plutonium accounts for 72 tons. Japan holds 1.6 tons 
of the reprocessed variety. 
  At a time when the world's supply of reprocessed plutonium 
is 
already high, the scrapping of nuclear arms suggests a growing 
surplus. Particularly worrisome is a possible outflow of the 
substance from the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union. 
  It is time to give serious consideration to the concept of 
internationally organized supervision of plutonium use and 
storage. Japan stands to benefit from such a global framework as 
it moves into the next, practical phase of its plutonium program. 
  The idea of putting plutonium under some form of 
international custody is nothing new. The issue was debated by a 
panel of experts at the International Atomic Energy Agency from 
1978 through 1982, with the results submitted for consideration 
by the IAEA board. The initiative got nowhere, however, because 
it was too difficult to reconcile conflicts of national 
interests while the Cold War was still going strong. 
  Global circumstances have undergone a sea change since then, 
and the possibility of reaching international nuclear accords 
has improved significantly. This has prompted moves inside the 
IAEA, albeit unofficial, to look at international plutonium 
control in a fresh light. 
  The issue needs to be approached from a variety of 
perspectives: Should control extend to all plutonium or just to 
surplus stockpiles? How should military-use plutonium be dealt 
with? What criteria should be followed in allowing a country to 
use the substance? These and other questions are bound to expose 
considerable differences among countries and touch off heated 
debate. 
  Japan is the only plutonium-using nation that has no nuclear 
weapons. It is also the only nation that has every fallen victim 
to nuclear bombing. These conditions uniquely qualify the 
country to actively advocate an international system to tame the 
potentially lethal material, rather than passively follow the 
lead of others. 
  In order to play such a role, Japan must not allow itself to 
be blinded by narrow national interests, and must exhibit a 
clear vision of what exactly international control of plutonium 
means for world peace and energy demand. Tokyo also must have 
the courage to stand up to the brazen pursuit of self-interest 
by the nuclear powers, such as was seen during efforts to 
enhance the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

  [Text] The construction of a fast-breeder reactor is likely 
to begin early next century instead of in the late 1990s as 
originally planned, Kohei Abe, head of the Federation of 
Electric Power Companies, announced at a press conference last 
week. 
  A fast-breeder reactor, which can turn spent uranium into 
usable plutonium while producing electricity, is one of the core 
facilities for nuclear-fuel recycling. 
  The postponement is partly a reflection of the increasingly 
cautious attitude toward the use of plutonium among Western 
nations, including the U.S., Britain, Germany, and France, which 
have already suspended research into this new type of reactor, 
experts said. 
  A further factor in the delay is that the project will cost 
1.5 times as much as the construction of a light-water reactor, 
which can generate the same amount of electricity, officials 
said. Also, the construction will be time-consuming. 
  The planned reactor, designed to generate 670,000kw of 
electricity, is intended to be a follow-up to the Monju 
fast-breeder reactor in Fukui Prefecture. Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. is preparing to put Monju into 
full operation with an output capacity of 280,000kw. 
  The federation has set up a panel comprised of senior 
officials of nine electric power companies to discuss the timing 
of the building of the new reactor. In an interim report, the 
panel decided to propose that the construction be postponed.

  [Text] In order to strengthen nuclear non-proliferation, 
the Science and Technology Agency (STA) has proposed the idea of 
creating an ``international system for control of plutonium and 
highly enriched uranium,'' which will unify the control of 
nuclear materials, track plans for their use and make this 
information available internationally. The goals of this system 
are appropriate control of nuclear materials that are being 
generated by the dismantling of nuclear weapons and increased 
transparency in their use. The study group on the international 
control of plutonium (chaired by Hiroyoshi Kurihara, a member of 
the board of directors of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation (PNC)), a research committee for the 
director-general of STA's Nuclear Energy Bureau, drew up a basic 
framework for the system and presented it as an interim report 
to the Japan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) at the end of last 
week. STA wants to continue studies through exchanges of views 
with other countries and then complete the system. 
  According to STA, countries participating in this system 
will 
in principle be (1) countries that are dismantling nuclear 
weapons, (2) countries that have nuclear weapons and carry out 
commercial reprocessing, (3) countries that are implementing a 
nuclear fuel cycle, and (4) countries that are using plutonium 
and highly enriched uranium for research on peaceful use of 
these substances. 
  Participating countries will register with the system all 
the 
plutonium and highly enriched uranium (over 10&percnt; enriched) 
in 
each facility. They will report to the system their utilization 
plans; and they will get confirmation from a committee composed 
of representatives from all participating countries. Plutonium 
in excess of the utilization plans will be controlled in a 
storage and control facility to be established by the 
participating countries. Withdrawal of excess plutonium will be 
via request by the owner country and will be within the scope of 
its utilization plan. Also, the secretariat of the proposed 
system will be a function of the secretariat of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Additionally, the plan is to create a multilateral study 
forum composed of the IAEA and interested countries to work on 
the creation of this system.

  [Text] At the general meeting of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), Science and Technology Agency (STA) 
Director General Eda proposed a system for the international 
control of plutonium and sought efforts to ensure transparency. 
  At the general meeting of the IAEA in Vienna, Austria, on 27 
September, STA Director General Eda reported on the status of 
Japan's study of a system for international control of 
non-military use of plutonium, and called for cooperation in the 
international community. Japan is promoting the development and 
use of nuclear energy built around the use of plutonium, and 
because plutonium use under appropriate control is essential, we 
will watch future responses with interest. 
  On the other hand, a symposium called ``Why Plutonium Now,'' 
which was co-hosted by the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum and the 
nuclear energy data and information office, was held in Osaka 
City on 25 September. The pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear factions 
sat down together for the first time. The surfacing of plutonium 
as the focal point of the development and use of nuclear energy 
is a recent thing, and it is encouraging that the two sides 
finally have come together in a debate on the pros and cons and 
other problems of nuclear energy, where emotions have tended to 
take precedence in the past. 
  The overall nuclear picture in the international community 
consists of the United States, which touts nuclear 
non-proliferation but wears the armor of global strategy which 
is visible under its robe, China and several ``suspected nuclear 
countries,'' which are defying the United States, and Russia, 
which has been trying to dispose of nuclear warheads since the 
disassembling of the former Soviet Union. The focus of this is 
on plutonium. 
  The sole reason for such concern about plutonium is that it 
can easily be converted to use in nuclear weapons. Unlike 
uranium that requires enrichment, plutonium produced in a 
nuclear reactor can be separated, extracted and used almost as 
is for nuclear weapons, and this can be done with only basic 
chemical knowledge. Enriched uranium can be mixed with natural 
uranium to lower its concentration and make it difficult to 
convert to nuclear weapon use, but in contrast, there is no 
effective means to prevent the conversion of plutonium. 
  Furthermore, use of plutonium in nuclear power plants, 
certainly in fast breeder reactors but even in light water 
reactors and other types of nuclear reactors, is disadvantageous 
in terms of economical operation; and it is difficult to say 
that the safety of the technology has been verified fully. The 
current environment is such that insisting on plutonium use at 
this time would tend to create suspicion that there is an 
intention to develop nuclear weapons. 
  It probably is true that this sort of suspicion is hidden 
behind some of the domestic and foreign criticism. There are a 
number of reasons and one big one is that the government has not 
provided sufficient appropriate explanation to gain the people's 
understanding. There is plenty to reflect upon, such as whether 
the petitions and views of civic groups opposed to plutonium use 
have been heeded with humility, or whether it was thought that 
it would be sufficient to provide technical explanations that 
were over the heads of residents with little expert knowledge. 
  Ensuring transparency in the use of plutonium is the most 
important goal of international control. The statement Director 
General Eda made at the IAEA general meeting probably resulted 
from an STA study. International transparency is supported by 
domestic transparency. It needs to be stressed that efforts to 
gain domestic understanding will lead to understanding in the 
international community.

  [Text] The Electric Power Development Company (EPDC) has 
begun looking into exporters of heavy water for the 
demonstration advanced thermal reactor (ATR), which is in the 
planning stage in Oma-machi, Aomori Prefecture. Unlike the light 
water reactor used by the electric power companies, heavy water 
is used as a neutron modifier in the ATR. There is little merit 
to producing heavy water domestically because the ATR is almost 
the only way it is used in Japan. That is why a reliable 
exporter must be ensured. EPDC's survey probably will cover 
Canada and China. The value of the commercial transaction will 
be in the order of &yen;10 billion, and will contribute to 
increased international procurement by the electric power 
industry. 
  EPDC plans to begin construction of the demonstration ATR in 
Oma-machi in 1996, and begin operation in 2002, and it will load 
deuterium as a modifier 2 years before the start of operation. 
Once 350 tons are loaded initially, only a small amount per year 
will be needed as supplements. For the prototype ATR ``Fugen,'' 
which is being operated by the Power Reactor and Nuclear 
Development Corporation in Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture, heavy 
water was purchased from Norway, the former West Germany and 
China. 
  Canada, China, Norway and Germany have put in bids for 
EPDC's 
heavy water contract. Canada was considered the strongest 
candidate because it has a large heavy water production 
facility. It is used by the CANDU heavy water reactor, which was 
developed independently by Canada. There is talk, however, that 
the heavy water plant will be closed when the Darlinton Number 4 
plant (Ontario Province) is completed and the current project is 
concluded. That is why candidates other than Canada must be 
considered. 
  China has said that it has heavy water manufacturing 
equipment for its nuclear weapon development program and it can 
supply Japan with heavy water in 10 - 100 ton units. It could 
provide the amount needed for the ATR over a period of several 
years. The difficulty with Norway and Germany is that their 
supplying capability is even less than that of China. India, 
which incorporated Canada's CANDU reactor technology, also has a 
heavy water manufacturing facility, but it is not considered 
reliable enough at this time. 
  A few years ago, the price of heavy water was &yen;10,000 to 
&yen;30,000 per liter. Recently, however, this has dropped to 
&yen;2,000 to &yen;5,000, when the effect of the high yen is 
factored in. The heavy water for the initial loading of the ATR 
alone will be a million yen transaction. EPDC will be watching 
trends in the yen exchange rate as it negotiates a procurement 
contract.

<F P=106> [Article by Junichi Taki, editorial staff writer] </F>
  [Text] A symposium, ``Why Plutonium Now,'' where both 
proponents and opponents of plutonium use sat down at the same 
table, was held in Osaka City on 25 September. This was realized 
for the first time under the joint auspices of the Japan Atomic 
Industrial Forum, Inc. (JAIF) and the nuclear energy data and 
information office, a group opposed to plutonium use. Plutonium 
use is under international scrutiny, not just from the viewpoint 
of energy supply and safety, but also from the viewpoint of 
prevention of nuclear proliferation. It was hoped that the 
symposium would be a step in the path toward a policy decision 
made by the people, not an imposition of the government's 
thinking, but the arguments did not necessarily mesh up. 
<H3>  Europe and United States Abandon Use of Plutonium, Nuclear 
Energy </H3>
  The government and the electric power industry are promoting 
a recycling (nuclear fuel cycle) policy, in which plutonium will 
be extracted from spent nuclear fuel and reused as fuel. 
Construction has begun on a plant to reprocess spent nuclear 
fuel, and it also will be a plutonium extraction facility (in 
Rokkasho-Mura, Aomori Prefecture). The fast breeder reactor 
``Monju'' (Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture) will start operating 
next spring. It is a prototype of the next-generation nuclear 
reactor that will burn plutonium and other nuclear fuels to 
produce electricity. 
  Although plutonium enables effective use of uranium 
resources 
through recycling, it also requires protection because it is 
used in nuclear weapons. The United States and the European 
countries have abandoned the policy of recycling for a variety 
of reasons, including fiscal difficulties, high operational cost 
and nuclear non-proliferation. 
  This is the environment in which the symposium was held. 
<H5>  Calm Exchange of Views </H5>
  The arguments of the proponents of plutonium use were: (1) 
nuclear fuel recycling is necessary to ensure a stable supply of 
energy and for effective use of resources; and (2) from the 
viewpoint of disposal of waste as well, it is better to separate 
spent nuclear fuel than dispose of it as is. 
  The arguments of the opponents were: (1) The energy gained 
from recycling is not as great as it has been played up to be; 
(2) Plutonium use is dangerous because the unknown quantity in 
the technology is too great; (3) it will lead to proliferation 
of nuclear weapons; and (4) overly stringent control of 
information may be the result of the need to protect nuclear 
materials. 
  The debate itself ended with both sides sticking to their 
respective positions. At the outset, JAIF Representative 
Director Kazuyuki Mori urged the participants to ``discuss 
matters frankly and calmly, putting aside labels.'' One could 
say that the debate was ``calm'' because it ended without anyone 
taking a contentious attitude, but the participants did not put 
aside their labels. Even questions from the audience were in the 
form of attempts to pin down panelists as representatives of 
their organizations, and it is unfortunate that it turned out 
differently than intended by the hosts. 
  The symposium was held in a hall that holds 300 people, and 
there were about 100 in the general audience. There were about 
5,300 requests to attend, but since there probably were many who 
sent in multiple postcards requesting admission, one cannot 
assume that this number of requests is directly represents the 
degree of general interest. In fact, many appeared to be 
participants in pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear activities and could 
be regarded as people involved in this issue in a broad sense. 
  It will take a lot more effort before the plutonium issue is 
debated more widely by the Japanese people, especially to 
involve the residents of large cities who enjoy the benefits of 
electric power supply. 
<H5>  Continuity Will Build Trust </H5>
  Despite its being a pressing problem impacting on energy and 
the environment, this issue is difficult to understand and 
remote from the experience of the general populace. One can 
sympathize with Nisaburo Takagi, representative of the nuclear 
energy data and information office, who pointed out that ``The 
national government should bear the cost'' of efforts to arouse 
debate. 
  Although the government may explain policy decisions to the 
people, it does little to actively provide materials or the 
environment in which these can be challenged. One wonders if it 
really is a good thing that dissenting opinions are not raised. 
Dissension is necessary in order to achieve understanding. 
  Michiko Ogiso, a panelist from the anti-nuclear faction, 
said, ``I agree with Mr. Kikuike (pro-nuclear side) on the point 
that a relationship of trust that has an element of tension is 
needed.'' Continuity should create trust, and should result in 
finding words that can be used to discuss these issues with the 
general populace. Many in the audience expressed the hope that 
this sort of opportunity would continue to be provided. One 
hopes that it will continue. 
  List of participants: Michiko Ogiso, secretary of the Fukui 
Prefecture citizens against nuclear power generation; Futaba 
Ono, assistant professor, nuclear engineering research facility, 
engineering department, Tokyo University; Saburo Kikuike, 
director, planning department, Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation; Keiji Kobayashi, assistant professor, 
nuclear reactor test center, Kyoto University; Nisaburo Takagi, 
representative of the nuclear energy data and information 
office; Mitsuhiro Yokote, director, nuclear fuel department, 
Kansai Electric Power Company; and Hiroyuki Torii, editorial 
staff, Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc. (moderator).

  [Text] According to the ``estimate for the FY94 nuclear 
energy related accounts,'' the government's entire budget 
relating to nuclear energy, excluding the Ministry of Education 
(i.e., for eight government agencies including the Science and 
Technology Agency (STA), MITI and the Foreign Ministry) will be 
about &yen;458,711 million, a 1.7&percnt; increase from this 
fiscal 
year. 
  The nuclear related accounts of MITI and STA were reported 
in 
an earlier edition. In addition, the Foreign Ministry's account 
will be &yen;4,866 million, a 6.9&percnt; increase over this 
fiscal 
year. In addition to the &yen;4,102 million budgeted for Japan's 
contribution and share of expenses in the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), &yen;332 million for Japan's share of 
expenses in the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and 
approximately &yen;20 million for the cost of participation in 
international conferences, &yen;432 million has been newly 
budgeted for contribution to the nuclear energy safety support 
fund. 
  The Ministry of Transport requested the same amount as this 
fiscal year, about &yen;34 million, to continue surveys and 
analyses needed to confirm the safety of transporting of 
radioactive materials, and to draw up safety standards for 
transporting of radioactive materials. 
  The nuclear energy related account for the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) will be increased by 
1.4&percnt; to about &yen;68 million. MAFF has budgeted &yen;45 
million for the Tsukuba agricultural research interchange center 
(the RI training facility), and about &yen;24 million for 
startup expenses for eradication experiments and prevention of 
breeding of arimodoki [phonetic] beetle in the Amami Islands, 
Kagoshima Prefecture. At the same time, MAFF has eliminated the 
budget for the urimi [phonetic] fly infestation prevention 
project in the Amami Islands. 
  The Okinawa Development Agency account will be slashed 
25.1&percnt; 
to &yen;625 million. The allocation for the urimi [phonetic] fly 
infestation prevention project in Okinawa will be cut back 
substantially to &yen;566 million, while about &yen;60 million 
will be added to begin eradication experiments and prevention of 
breeding of the potato beetle. 
  The Ministry of Health and Welfare will allocate the same 
amount as this fiscal year, about &yen;300,000, to the cost of 
monitoring, control and guidance for medical equipment and 
pharmaceuticals. 
  The Ministry of Home Affairs also will allocate the same 
amount as this fiscal year, about &yen;2 million, to provide 
guidance for nuclear disaster countermeasures.

  On 30 August, STA announced its budget estimate request for 
next fiscal year. The nuclear energy related portion is 
&yen;189,206 million from the general account (a 3.1&percnt; 
increase 
from the preceding fiscal year) and &yen;141,124 million from 
the special account for electric power resource development (a 
.4&percnt; increase from the preceding fiscal year), for a total 
of 
&yen;330,331 million (a 2.1&percnt; increase from the preceding 
fiscal 
year). Next fiscal year, efforts will be made toward new 
developments in plutonium use and nuclear fuel recycling, such 
as the beginning of full-scale construction of a recycling 
equipment testing facility (RETF) and manufacturing of equipment 
for the demonstration advanced thermal reactor (ATR) fuel 
fabrication development facility, international problems 
regarding nuclear non-proliferation will be addressed and public 
relations concerning nuclear energy will be enhanced. 
  STA's total budget request is &yen;617 billion (a 
6.1&percnt; 
increase), the first time it has gone to the &yen;600 billion 
level. Nuclear energy related allocations are 53.5&percnt; of the 
total budget request (it was 55.7&percnt; in the preceding year). 
  Looking at the budget request in terms of institutions, the 
Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) accounts for 
&yen;108,745 million, a 5.2&percnt; increase. About &yen;22 
billion 
has been requested for nuclear fusion research. Of this, about 
&yen;8.2 billion is allocated for cooperation in the engineering 
design activities of the International Thermonuclear Fusion 
Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, which will be going into 
its third year, and about &yen;10.3 billion is for JT-60 
operational control. 
  Also, a contribution of about &yen;11.3 billion to the high 
temperature test reactor (HTTR) will be made with the goal of 
reaching criticality in FY98. About &yen;5.9 billion is 
requested for the large-scale radiation (SPRing-8) facility, 
which is being built jointly with the Institute of Physical and 
Chemical Research. Shared use of part of this facility is 
scheduled to begin in FY97. About &yen;2.2 billion is requested 
for decommissioning of the nuclear-powered ship Mutsu and about 
&yen;2 billion is requested for future R&amp;D on nuclear-powered 
ships. 
  The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation 
(PNC) has requested a total of &yen;153,522 million, a .2&percnt; 
increase, from the general account and the diversification 
account of the special account for electric power resource 
development. 
  The portion from the general account is &yen;52,663 million 
(2&percnt; increase), and about &yen;10.9 billion is allocated 
for 
fast breeder reactor (FBR) development. About &yen;1.8 billion 
has been allocated to the ``Joyo'' upgrade remodeling (Mark III) 
project and about &yen;5.8 billion is for preparations for tests 
to study the characteristics of coolant flow methods for the top 
entry type reactor, which is said to be the reactor type 
selected for the demonstration FBR, and for technical 
confirmation tests in connection with large-scale structural 
design. 
  In addition, about &yen;1 billion has been allocated for 
development of FBR reprocessing and other reprocessing 
technologies, and about &yen;4.5 billion is for development of 
high level radioactive waste (HLW) disposal technology. 
  The amount requested from the diversification account of the 
special account for electric power resource development is 
&yen;100,859 million (.7&percnt; decrease). The decrease is due 
to the 
fact that the construction cost (about &yen;42.9 billion) of the 
``Monju,'' which takes up about half of expenditures, is about 
&yen;5.7 billion less than the preceding fiscal year. The major 
portion of expenditures for ``Monju'' construction costs will 
end in FY94. Additional requests are for about &yen;6.9 billion 
for RETF construction and about &yen;3.5 billion for HLW 
processing technology. 
  The budget request for the National Institute of 
Radiological 
Sciences (NIRS) is for &yen;13,249 million (19.8&percnt; 
decrease). Of 
this, about &yen;6.7 billion will be committed to projects at 
the heavy particle ray cancer treatment center. clinical testing 
that will begin this fiscal year will be continued. About 
&yen;1.4 billion has been allocated to begin construction of new 
hospital buildings and a center for international common use of 
heavy particle ray clinical equipment will be designed. 
  The allocation for the Institute of Physical and Chemical 
Research (IPCR) is &yen;8,978 million (30.4&percnt; increase). 
About 
&yen;6.3 billion is for cost of construction of SPRing-8, which 
is being built jointly with JAERI. About &yen;2.2 billion has 
been requested for heavy ion science comprehensive research. 
  On the other hand, &yen;5,194 million (32.7&percnt; 
increase) has 
been allocated for public relations related costs from the 
electric power resource siting account. The public relations 
budget increases every year, and in FY94, public relations work 
concerning plutonium use and FBRs will be enhanced. Subsidies 
for nuclear power generation facility safety training and grants 
for social welfare of regions surrounding nuclear power 
generation facilities will be created from the electric power 
resource siting account. 
  Furthermore, consideration is being given to establishing 
the 
``safeguards center'' (provisional name) as a base for 
safeguards related activities at the fuel cycle facility in 
Rokkasho-Mura, Aomori Prefecture, and FY94 will be the first 
time that an allocation has been made for this project. Other 
new allocations are for a survey of the effects of ocean dumping 
of radioactive waste by Russia, transporting measures for the 
return of waste, and expenses for consultations on a system for 
Asian nuclear energy cooperation. Efforts also are being made to 
increase support for nuclear safety in Russia and eastern Europe. 
<H5>  MITI's Budget </H5>
  MITI submitted its estimated budget request for FY94 on 31 
August. The nuclear energy related budget items included 
&yen;287 million from the general account (about 4&percnt; 
increase 
from preceding fiscal year), &yen;93,209 million from the siting 
account of the electric power resource special account (about 
1.3&percnt; increase), &yen;29,268 million from the 
diversification 
account of the electric power resource special account (about 
1.8&percnt; decrease), and &yen;382.5 billion as the Japan 
Development 
Bank (JDB) quota of fiscal investments and loans (about 3&percnt; 
increase). 
  The estimated budget request, reflecting the new 
administration's policies, is aimed at promoting a strong 
nuclear energy policy based on six principles: enhancement of 
safety measures, provision of information and other public 
relations measures, technological developments in areas such as 
sitings, nuclear fuel cycle, and new reactor types, and 
promotion of international cooperation. 
  In view of the new administration's policies, safety 
measures 
will continue to be one of the emphases of MITI's policies. Of 
these safety measures, special emphasis will continue to be 
placed on testing to confirm reliability of advanced light water 
reactor (LWR) technology, human error prevention measures and 
severe accident countermeasures. Total allocation will be almost 
&yen;30 billion from the electric power resource development 
special account. Through these measures, MITI plans to work to 
raise the people's understanding of safety. A new endeavor will 
be to spend &yen;200 million to begin reliability confirmation 
testing of an advanced control rod drive mechanism as part of 
reliability confirmation testing of welding and other areas 
affected by heat, which will be carried out whenever concrete 
progress is made on the advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR). 
Also, MITI will input &yen;1.2 billion, double the FY 93 amount, 
into reliability confirmation testing, to confirm the margin of 
safety against the flow excitation phenomenon, which was 
discovered when there was trouble with the tubing in the steam 
generator of the Number 2 Mihama plant. The building of testing 
equipment will begin. 
  The highlight of the siting promotion measures is the 
creation of a &yen;2.5 billion grant for measures to promote 
important electric power resource sitings that require 
countermeasures. To strengthen earlier site measures, a grant 
was requested for management and maintenance of public 
facilities, which will be applied to the recently reviewed 
important electric power resources requiring countermeasures. 
Initially, around five locations will be selected to receive 
coverage under the grant. Additionally, the FY93 &yen;3.9 
billion subsidy to support the nurturing of industries in 
regions where electric power resources are located has been 
increased to &yen;5.37 billion to support stepped up promotion 
of industries in regions where sites are located. MITI also 
plans to provide generous support to promote social welfare 
measures in regions surrounding sites by substantially 
increasing the grant for social welfare measures for regions 
surrounding nuclear power facilities from &yen;50 million in 
FY93 to &yen;490 million in FY94. MITI intends to ensure a 
budget of over &yen;60 billion for such siting related measures. 
  In view of the new administration's policies, public 
relations measures will continue to emphasize disclosure of 
information. MITI is aiming for yet another increase, from 
&yen;6.6 billion in FY93 to &yen;8.7 billion in FY94. Special 
emphasis will be given to public relations measures aimed at 
overseas audiences concerning the use of plutonium, but 
multimedia public relations measures will be developed for 
domestic consumption as well. For this purpose, MITI is 
requesting an increase, from &yen;4.08 billion in FY93 to 
&yen;5.77 billion to cover the expense of consignment of 
electric power resource siting promotion surveys, etc. 
  As for promotion of the nuclear fuel cycle, to ensure 
funding 
for the commencement of full-scale facility construction, 
including start of construction of the reprocessing facility and 
construction to expand the enrichment facility, MITI has 
requested a substantial increase in the JDB quota of fiscal 
investments and loans, from &yen;290 billion in FY93 to 
&yen;382.5 billion in FY94. 
  MITI also has requested an allocation from the JDB's nuclear 
energy quota for funding support to build a domestic mixed oxide 
(MOX) fuel fabrication enterprise. This was requested for the 
first time in the preceding fiscal year, but was held over 
because of lack of sufficient progress in the project. This was 
included in the request for FY94 on the assumption that the 
project will enter the stage of concrete progress, such as a 
decision on the lead enterprise.

  [Text] This paper describes conductive small antennas 
composed of helical coil elements and quarter-wave matching 
circuits. We obtained a high efficiency of 70&percnt; by using a 
500 
MHz band one-element antenna with &lgr;/40 element. We also 
realized a unidirectional radiation pattern and a higher 
radiation efficiency than an equivalent Cu antenna by using a 
900 MHz band two-element superdirective antenna with a &lgr;/20 
element and a &lgr;/11 element spacing. We confirm that the use 
of 
superconductors and the present design principle are very 
effective for realizing high efficient small antennas. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Highly efficient small antennas are required for use as 
environmental monitors, which can detect long wavelength radio 
waves sensitively. However, the radiation resistance is very low 
in electrically small antennas, which have elements whose length 
is shorter than their wavelength. The radiation resistance of 
superdirective allay antennas, which have element spacings 
shorter than their wavelength, are also very low. Consequently, 
the loss resistance is relatively high and the radiation 
efficiency is very low when these small antennas are made of 
normal conductors. However, if a superconductor is used to 
fabricate small antennas, high efficiency can be maintained. 
Therefore, small antennas made of metal superconductors, such as 
lead, have been studied.&lt;sup&gt; 1,2&lt;/sup&gt;  Although these antennas 
exhibited a lower antenna loss than equivalent antennas made of 
normal conductors, it was difficult to achieve a high absolute 
gain because they required the use of a cooling system with 
metal insulators, and this caused a decrease in antenna gain. 
  Since the discovery of high temperature superconductors 
(HTS), such as YBaCuO (YBCO) and BiSrCaCuO (BSCCO), many 
superconductive small antennas have been 
developed&lt;sup&gt; 3-5&lt;/sup&gt;  because they only require simple 
cooling systems. 
  This paper proposes small antennas made with HTS, which are 
composed of helical elements and quarter-wave matching circuits 
and a feed network.&lt;sup&gt; 6-9&lt;/sup&gt;  The properties of these 
antennas are also described. 
<H5>  1. Antenna Structure </H5>
  Figure 1(a) and (b) show the equivalent circuits of a 
one-element (a) and a two-element (b) antenna. 
I&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  (= &xgr;&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; I&lt;inf&gt; 0&lt;/inf&gt; 
exp (j&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; ) where&xgr;&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; , I&lt;inf&gt; 0&lt;/inf&gt; , 
&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  are real numbers) and 
R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  are, respectively, the excitation 
currents and input resistance of the n-th element (n = 1,2) 
which is self-resonating at a designed frequency. 
Z&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; cn&lt;/inf&gt; , &agr;&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  and 
L&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  are the characteristic impedance, 
attenuation constant and length of the matching circuit, 
respectively. Z&lt;sup&gt; d&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; cn&lt;/inf&gt; , 
&agr;&lt;sup&gt; d&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  and L&lt;sup&gt; d&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; 
are the characteristic impedance, attenuation constant and 
length of delay times, respectively, Z&lt;sup&gt; f&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; c&lt;/inf&gt; 
is the characteristic impedance of a feed line. The antenna is 
composed of a feed network which is composed of a feed line and 
delay lines, matching circuits and helical elements. Since 
R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  values are generally much lower 
than Z&lt;sup&gt; f&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; c&lt;/inf&gt;  values, it is essential to 
match these impedances. &lgr;/4 matching circuits are used in 
these antennas, because they are easily formed using brittle 
sintered HTS. Self-resonant helical coils are used for the 
radiators,&lt;sup&gt; 10&lt;/sup&gt;  because only the resistance (real part 
of the impedance) can be matched with a &lgr;/4 matching circuit. 
In order to adjust each I&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  to its 
designed value, Z&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; cn&lt;/inf&gt;  and 
L&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  are determined while 
L&lt;sup&gt; m&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  is fixed at a quarter of an 
effective wavelength on a parallel line. Figure 2 shows the 
antennas made of HTS materials. Antennas A and B are 500 MHz 
band one-element antennas with elements which are &lgr;/40 in 
length and antenna C is a 900 MHz-band two-element end fire 
superdirective array antenna with &lgr;/20 length element and a 
&lgr;/11 element spacing. 







<H5>    2. One-Element Small Antenna </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Design and Fabrication </H5>
  The helical elements of antennas A and B in Figure 2 were 
designed to resonate at 500 MHz by using the moment 
method.&lt;sup&gt; 11&lt;/sup&gt;  The directive gain of the radiators was 
calculated at 0.5 dBi. Figure 3 shows the loss at a helical 
element (&zgr;&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; ) as a function of element length 
(L&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; ). When the surface resistance (R&lt;inf&gt; s&lt;/inf&gt; ) 
is large &zgr;&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt;  increases rapidly as L&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; 
decreases. The elements of antennas A and B were made of 
sintered BSCCO, whose surface resistance was about 0.5 m&ohm;'o'hgr; at 
500 MHz at 77 K.&lt;sup&gt; 12&lt;/sup&gt;  The &zgr;&lt;sup&gt; r&lt;/sup&gt;  values are 
therefore calculated to be about 0.4 dB in these elements. The 
input resistance of the element is calculated to be 0.37 &ohm;'o'hgr;. 



  The matching circuit of antenna A was made of two Cu bars 
and 
a dielectric sheet (teflon) was placed between them. A parallel 
meander line made of EuBaCuO thin-films&lt;sup&gt; 13&lt;/sup&gt;  was used 
for the matching circuit of antenna B in order to reduce the 
antenna size. The element and the matching circuit of both 
antennas were joined using silver paste. The loss of the Cu 
matching circuit of antenna A is not so highbecause the parallel 
line has a relatively large cross section.&lt;sup&gt; 7&lt;/sup&gt;  By 
connecting the parallel line of the matching circuit to the 
microstripline of the feed network, the microstripline works as 
a balun (converter from balanced mode to unbalanced 
mode).&lt;sup&gt; 6&lt;/sup&gt; 
<H5>  2.2 Results and Discussions </H5>
  Figure 4 shows the actual gain of antenna A as a function of 
frequency. The gain of an equivalent Cu antenna is also shown in 
this figure for comparison. The actual gain of antenna A was 
-1.2 dBi at 80 K and 488 MHz and was 7.8 dB and 6.2 dB higher 
than the actual gain of the equivalent Cu antenna at room 
temperature (R.T.) and 77 K, respectively. This value 
corresponds to 70&percnt; of the radiation efficiency, and it is 
also 
very high compared with those of previously reported 
superconductive small antennas. The actual gain of antenna B was 
-4.5 dBi at 80 K and 469 MHz, and this value was 9.6 dB and 5.4 
dB higher than that of the equivalent Cu antenna at R.T. and 70 
K, respectively. This enabled us to confirm that these 
superconductive small antennas are more effective in realizing 
high-gain than a Cu small antenna. The relatively lower gain in 
antenna B is attributed to the loss at the joint between the 
helical element and the matching circuit. We believe that the 
gain will be improved by improving the joining method. 



<H5>  3. Superdirective Array Antenna </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Design and Fabrication </H5>
  In a two-element array antenna, the excitation current for 
each element, which leads to results in maximum gain, should be 
determined by solving the following differential equation: 
  Partial derivative of G&lt;inf&gt; d&lt;/inf&gt;  with respect to 
I&lt;sup&gt; r&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  = O (n = 1,2) 
  where G&lt;inf&gt; d&lt;/inf&gt;  is the directive gain of an antenna. If 
we assume that the resonant frequency is 900 MHz and the element 
spacing (d&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; ) is 30, relations between excitation 
currents (I&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; , I&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; ) of &xgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  = 
&xgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  and &dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  - &dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  = 
165.6&deg; are obtained.&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  The self- and 
mutual-impedances (Z&lt;inf&gt; nm&lt;/inf&gt;  n,m = 1,2) of the elements 
are calculated by the moment method. The input impedances 
Z&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  (= R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  + 
jX&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt; ) of the elements are computed by 
using Z&lt;inf&gt; nm&lt;/inf&gt;  and I&lt;inf&gt; m&lt;/inf&gt; . In this antenna, we 
can theoretically expect a derivative gain of 6.2 dBi, which is 
5.3 dB higher than that of a one element antenna, and a front- 
to-back ratio of 7.9 dB in the radiation pattern. 
  Figure 5 shows the loss at the element (&zgr;&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; ) of 
a 900 MHz band two-element array antenna as a function of 
d&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; . When R&lt;inf&gt; s&lt;/inf&gt;  is large, &zgr;&lt;sup&gt; e&lt;/sup&gt; 
increases rapidly as d&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt;  decreases. As with antennas 
A and B the elements of antenna C were made of BSCCO. Since the 
surface resistance of BSCCO at 900 MHz and 80 K is 2 
m&ohm;'o'hgr;,&lt;sup&gt; 12&lt;/sup&gt;  the loss was calculated at about 2.5 dB. The 
input resistance of each element, R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; 
and R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; , was calculated at 2.0 &ohm;'o'hgr; and 
-1.66 &ohm;'o'hgr;, respectively. The negative value of 
R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  indicates that the element draws 
radiatedpower from the other element which has a positive 
R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; . This is due to the strong mutual 
coupling between two elements placed closely to each 
other.&lt;sup&gt; 14&lt;/sup&gt;  Therefore, in order to obtain a theoretical 
antenna gain, the power received at the negative 
R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  element must be fed back to the 
positive R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  element through the feed 
network. In order to realize the above feedback mechanism, the 
feed network must fulfill the following conditions: 



  (1) The difference in line length from the elements to the 
branch point must be equal to the phase difference between the 
excitation currents (&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt; ). 
  (2) The total line length between positive- and negative- 
R&lt;sup&gt; in&lt;/sup&gt;  elements via the branch point must also 
correspond to &dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; -&dgr;&lt;inf&gt; 1&lt;/inf&gt;  +/-&pgr;. 
  Consequently, L&lt;sup&gt; d&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;inf&gt; n&lt;/inf&gt;  is determined 
uniquely, and this is a particular feature of the superdirective 
array antenna.&lt;sup&gt; 9&lt;/sup&gt;  The matching circuit of antenna C 
was made of sintered BSCCO, and the feed network was made using 
a conventional printed circuit board (&egr;&lt;inf&gt; r&lt;/inf&gt;  = 10.2). 
The elements, the matching circuits and the feed network were 
joined together with silver paste. 
<H5>  3.2 Results and Discussion </H5>
  The actual gain of antenna C was -4.2 dBi at 910 MHz and 80 
K. Its gain was 5.4 dB and 4.0 dB higher than that of an 
equivalent Cu antenna at R.T. and 77 K, respectively. We 
therefore confirm that the superconductive small antenna 
exhibits a higher gain than a Cu antenna. Figure 6 shows the 
designed and measured radiation pattern of antenna C. Although 
unexpected radiations, which perhaps emanated from the feed 
system, were observed around &phgr; = 205&deg;, a unidirectional 
radiation pattern and front-to-back ratio of 6.8 dB were 
confirmed for the antenna. The fact that the actual gain of 
antenna C was lower than the designed value seemed to result 
mainly from ohmic losses in the Cu lines and silver paste 
joints, and unwanted radiation. The gain should be improved by 
changing the feed network from normal conductors to 
superconductors. 



<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  We proposed a design principle for superconductive small 
antennas with quarter-wavelength parallel line matching circuits 
and helical coil elements and/or a feed network. On the basis of 
this concept, we fabricated a 500 MHz-band one element antenna 
with a 0.025 &lgr; radiator and 900 MHz band two-element and 
end-fire superdirective array antenna with a 0.09 &lgr; radiator 
spacing and 0.05 &lgr; radiator length. These antennas exhibited 
a 
higher efficiency than an equivalent Cu antenna. We confirmed 
that the superconductor and the present antenna structures can 
be used to realize highly efficient small antennas.
