  [Text] Sia [Godfather] P. Pet is spending 300 million baht 
to develop 36 rai of land in the middle of Nakhon Phanom. He is 
building a huge open-air market with 1,800 stalls. He is trying 
to curry favor with merchants in order to win votes. He is also 
planning to build a trade center, commercial buildings, and a 
bus station. Construction is scheduled to get underway at the 
beginning of 1994. On the political front, he is continuing to 
fight even though ``Big Chiu'' [Chawalit Yongchaiyut] has 
announced that he will run in Zone 1. 
  Mr. Thanong Siriprichaphong, or Sia P. Pet, the president of 
the Little Duck hotel group and a Thai Nation Party MP [member 
of parliament] from Nakhon Phanom Province, told THAN SETTHAKIT 
that he is developing 36 rai along Nittayo Road in the heart of 
Nakhon Phanom City. He is building a large open-air market, a 
trade center, commercial buildings, and a bus station. He is 
investing about 300 million baht in this project. Construction 
is scheduled to get underway in 1994, and it is expected that 
businesses will open that same year. To date, no name has been 
given to the project. 
  The open-air market, which will be located on approximately 
seven rai, will have 1,800 stalls. Merchants in Nakhon Phanom 
Province will be able to buy or lease stalls at a low price. 
This will help solve the problems of merchants in Nakhon Phanom 
who lack places to sell their goods. There is now only one 
open-air market. Another problem is the lack of space at the 
existing stalls. This will also make it easier for people to buy 
goods. 
  The trade center will be very large. It may have mini-stores 
or super-stores, but there are no plans to build a large 
department store. The bus station, to be located nearby, will 
occupy approximately four rai. Commercial buildings will be 
built around the area. Various bus lines will be allowed to use 
the facility. At present, the various buses park in different 
locations. If they all stop at this bus station, this will make 
things more convenient for the people. 
  ``Right now, I can't give you all the details. Nakhon Phanom 
City plans to build a new road through this area. The exact 
location of the road isn't clear yet. This project must be 
located near this road. We should know the details in the near 
future. As for construction, all the preparations have been 
made. Once we know where the road will be built, we will begin 
drawing up the plans. Actually, it was villagers who came and 
asked me to build this project. They are particularly interested 
in our building an open-air market, because there are quite a 
few problems concerning this.'' 
  Thanong said that he will continue to engage in politics 
even 
though it is now certain that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the 
leader of the New Aspiration Party, will move his base from 
Nonthaburi Province and run for election in Zone 1 in Nakhon 
Phanom Province, which is the same zone where Mr. Thanong will 
run for election. General Chawalit has organized an election 
team in the area. In the next election, he [Thanong] will 
definitely run for election, and he is ready. He frequently gets 
out to visit people. How the election turns out is up to the 
people. Mr. Thanong denied the rumor that General Chawalit had 
sent people to ask him not to run for election. He said that 
there is no truth at all to that rumor.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Amphetamines have done such 
great damage to people's lives and property that everyone is now 
aware of their terrible effect. But even though a tough 
amphetamine control law has been promulgated, this has had 
little effect on either producers or users. Terrible accidents 
stemming from amphetamines occur frequently. 
  Mr. Sanchai Singhonglaka, the Region 1 chief judge, 
expressed 
concern about this problem, saying that the number of 
amphetamine cases tried in Region 1 courts has increased. Today, 
even though the court is handing down stiff sentences to those 
who violate the 1975 drug act, particularly those convicted in 
amphetamine cases, the number of amphetamine cases has continued 
to increase. 
  He said that since the beginning of 1993, a total of 1,241 
amphetamine cases have been heard by Region 1 courts. Of these, 
1,049 were charged with illegal possession, and 192 were charged 
with possession with intent to sell. The courts in Region 1 have 
rendered verdicts in 1,132 of these cases, and are still 
deliberating the other 109. In those cases that have been 
completed, the courts found 1,121 of the defendants guilty and 
six innocent. Four jumped bail, and the case against one was 
dropped because the defendant died. The courts in Region 1 
trying the largest number of amphetamine cases were the Saraburi 
provincial court, 337 cases, the Thanyaburi [as published] 
provincial court, 202, and the Ayuthaya provincial court, 125. 
  Mr. Udom Buntham, the director of the Legal Affairs and 
Crime 
Detection Division, Office of the Narcotics Control Board 
[ONCB], talked with reporters about the new law, which calls for 
stiffer penalties in amphetamine cases. He said that at present, 
sentences for those convicted of selling or producing 
amphetamines are rather light. This is because the present law 
is very outmoded. To ensure that things are in accord with the 
actual situation, the ONCB will ask the government to make the 
penalties for producers and traffickers the same as those 
imposed in heroin cases. This is now being considered by 
prosecutors before being submitted to the cabinet. Also, rewards 
leading to seizures will be increased. That is, for pure 
amphetamine powder, the reward will be increased from 3 baht to 
10 baht per gram. For amphetamine tablets, the reward for 1-50 
tablets will be 200 baht. For 51-1,000 tablets, the reward can 
be as high as 5,000 baht. In cases involving the seizure of more 
than 1,000 tablets, the person will receive an additional one 
baht per tablet up to a maximum of 100,000 baht.

  [Text] In an effort to round up foreigners who had entered 
the country illegally and who were thought to be engaged in 
criminal activities here, at the beginning of November 
metropolitan police raided several apartments and rented houses. 
  When police searched an apartment in the Pratu Nam area, 
they 
were shocked when they opened the door. Inside the apartment, 
they found 5-6 blacks in each room. The police searched almost 
10 rooms and found 40-50 people. Thus, it's not surprising why 
so many of these people can be seen walking around the Pratu Nam 
area in the day. 
  From examining their passports, it was found that all had 
entered the country legally as tourists and businessmen. Thus, 
the police had to release them. Police Colonel Khongdet Chusi, 
the deputy commander of the Northern Bangkok Metropolitan Police 
and a former police superintendent known for suppressing 
godfathers, said that ``we are very suspicious about what they 
are doing here.'' 
  Police files show that many blacks from African countries 
work as heroin couriers. They use Thailand as a transit point 
for smuggling heroin to a third country, including the United 
States and countries in Europe. In those countries, heroin is 
worth 10 times as much as it is here, that is, it increases from 
200,000 baht per kg to 2 million baht per kg. 
  The data matches that of narcotics control units. It was 
also 
discovered that traffickers were using the parking lot of a 
well-known shop in the Pratu Nam area as a narcotics delivery 
point. ``Those who are caught red-handed usually ask if they 
will be sentenced to death. After they are told that they won't 
be, they feel better. They have said that there is much poverty 
in their native country and so they have to take this risk. If 
they can get away with this, their lives will improve greatly. 
And even if they are caught, their families won't suffer, 
because the agents who hired them will take care of their 
families as agreed on beforehand,'' said Police Colonel Khongdet. 
  During the past 2-3 years, many blacks have been arrested on 
charges of trying to smuggle narcotics out of the country. Most 
have been arrested while waiting to board an airplane to a third 
country. They use a variety of techniques for smuggling drugs. 
In the past, they used to pack heroin in condoms and ingest the 
packets. One person could smuggle out only about 1 kg this way, 
which meant that many people had to be used each trip. This 
brought them to the attention of narcotics units. Also, this was 
very dangerous. Some of the couriers died because the 
heroin-filled packets burst in their stomachs. 
  Thus, traffickers changed their method by concealing the 
heroin in bottles of sauce, cans of flour, cosmetic bottles, and 
secret compartments in their suitcases. This made it difficult 
for officials to find the narcotics because the containers had 
to be torn apart to find the drugs. It is thought that the 
amount of heroin seized is much less than the amount that slips 
by Thai officials. 
  Statistics on heroin seizures nationwide show that in 1992, 
officials seized a total of 1,062 kg. During the first six 
months of 1993, officials seized 988.6 kg with a domestic value 
of more than 197 million baht, or 1,970 million baht in Europe 
or the United States. 
  The statistics show that seizures have increased this year. 
Considering the amount of heroin successfully smuggled out of 
the country, the amount of money involved is staggering and 
seems worth the risk. In particular, officials have not been 
able to get at the chief culprits behind the heroin smuggling. 
This is because the heroin smuggling routes are divided into 
sections. 
  In 1992, officials arrested 536 suspected couriers in 169 
cases. Most, 242, were Burmese, who were caught smuggling 43 kg 
of heroin. Twelve blacks from Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana were 
arrested with 19 kg of heroin. Altogether, officials seized 239 
kg. During the first six months of 1993, officials arrested 489 
suspects and seized 418 kg of heroin. Most were Burmese, who 
were caught with 32 kg of heroin. Also arrested were two 
Taiwanese with 114 kg, 10 blacks with 25 kg, and six Hong Kong 
Chinese with 15 kg. 
  Even though the number of arrests has increased, a large 
number have managed to avoid being arrested and smuggle the 
heroin out of the country. The methods used to smuggle heroin, 
including both methods of concealment and the selection of 
couriers, have improved. 
  When the heroin traffickers learned that narcotics units 
were 
keeping close watch on blacks, they started to hire others to 
work as couriers, particularly people from poor Asian countries. 
Today, officials have been told to keep a close watch on Burmese.

  [Text] At 0800 hours on 20 November, a number of officials 
from BPP [Border Patrol Police] Unit 34 went to Ban Tha Toei in 
Muang District, Tak Province, after learning that marijuana was 
being grown in this subdistrict. When the officials reached 
their target, they found more than 45 rai of marijuana. The 
officials cut down the plants, which weighed a total of 
approximately 30 tons. 
  A report stated that the officials also found mines in the 
marijuana fields and so they had to be very careful. During the 
time that they were destroying the marijuana plants, they could 
periodically hear explosions set off to harass them. Thus, a 
team of officials went to arrest those who were planting the 
mines. But they all managed to escape. None of the officials was 
injured. It was later learned that these marijuana plants had 
been planted by Hmong tribesmen. 
  In Khao Chok Subdistrict, Sisawat District, Kanchanaburi 
Province, BPP officials destroyed a field of marijuana plants in 
their area of responsibility. And in Dan Chang District, 
Suphanburi Province, officials destroyed 30 tons of marijuana 
valued at approximately 9 million baht.

  [Text] Police Major General Pramot Pansakun, the commander 
of the Region 2 Border Patrol Police (BPP), Khon Kaen, and Thai 
and American narcotics suppression officials accompanied by 
reporters, spent more than 2 hours climbing a high mountain to 
destroy a Hmong poppy field located along the border between Dan 
Sai District in Loei Province, Nakhon Thai District in 
Phitsanulok Province, and Lomsak District in Phetchabun Province. 
  At approximately 1000 hours on 17 November, officials took 
two helicopters to this area. But when they arrived, the 
helicopters couldn't land and had to land about 10 km from the 
area planted in poppies. The officials and reporters spent about 
2 hours climbing the mountain to reach the poppy field located 
along the side of the mountain. The poppies were in full bloom. 
  The Hmong tribesmen had interplanted the poppies with 
bananas 
and corn in order to conceal the poppies from officials 
searching the area by helicopter. They had planted a short 
variety of poppy that reaches a height of only 50 centimeters. 
The officials all helped cut down the poppy plants. By 1600 
hours, they had destroyed only about 30 rai of plants, valued 
about 720,000 baht. That left at least 100 rai of poppies. But 
the officials were all very tired and so they stopped for the 
moment. 
  The commander of the Region 2 BPP said that he had received 
good cooperation from all sides. Those Hmong tribesmen had 
planted a large number of poppy plants. That area could be 
called the ``Golden Triangle of the Northeast.'' When the 
poppies mature, the opium sap is removed and sold to dealers who 
then refine it into heroin. One rai of poppies can produce about 
two kg of raw opium. It takes seven kg of raw opium to produce 1 
kg of heroin. Or one kg of opium can produce enough heroin to 
supply at least 20,000 heroin addicts. 
  Police Major General Pramot said that even though officials 
managed to destroy a large number of poppy plants, he ordered 
Police Colonel Suraphong Khemasingkhi, the superintendent of BPP 
Unit 24, to mobilize a team of BPP officials and asked for the 
cooperation of the units concerned to destroy the rest. No one 
will be arrested this time, because that could damage relations 
with these people. Officials will try to explain things to the 
hill tribes and encourage them to plant other crops.

  [Excerpt] Mr. Samphan Thongsamak, the minister of 
education, talked with reporters in Nakhon Sithammarat Province 
about the spread of drugs among youths in the south. He said 
that drug use is now spreading rapidly. The Ministry of 
Education is trying get teachers to tell students about the 
dangers of drugs. He said that in his view, there has been a 
marked increase in drug use in the south. This is the 
responsibility of narcotics units and the police. Administrative 
officials must formulate a system in order to step up the 
monitoring of drug activities. 
  ``It must be admitted that in the southern border provinces, 
a large number of youths are addicted to drugs. But the 
government is not ignoring this problem. Teachers will be asked 
to monitor their students more closely in order to control drug 
use. This is all that the Ministry of Education can do.''

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] At 1130 hours on 13 November at 
the Customs Department, Don Muang Airport, from an investigation 
conducted by Mr. Suphachai Phisetthawanit, the director-general 
of the Customs Department, it was learned that narcotics 
traffickers were planning to smuggle a shipment of heroin out of 
the country. Thus, he ordered 1st Lieutenant Anan Pananon, the 
deputy director-general for narcotics suppression, to formulate 
a plan and arrest the traffickers. At 0200 hours, officials from 
the Narcotics Control Division, Customs Department, led by Mr. 
Chawalit Setthamethikun, the division director, searched and 
arrested Mr. Onomo Simaregina, age 35, an Ethiopian, who was 
carrying a Cameroon passport, No 154685; Mr. Mamud, age 33, an 
Ethiopian, who was carrying a Niger passport, No 112207/92; and 
Mr. Bar Alfa, age 33, an Ethiopian, who was carrying a Sierra 
Leone passport, No O-159778. 
  When the officials searched the three suspects, they found 
one marine-colored suitcase containing 10 bricks of heroin that 
had been wrapped in clear plastic bound with wrapping tape. This 
heroin weighed approximately 3.6 kg. They also found a black 
suitcase containing approximately seven kg of heroin. 
Altogether, officials seized approximately 17.2 kg [as 
published] of heroin. This heroin had a domestic value of 3.4 
million baht. Abroad, it would have been worth 340 million baht. 
The suspects were arrested in the outbound passenger lounge at 
Don Muang Airport. 
  During the interrogation, the three suspects said that they 
were planning to travel from Bangkok to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 
with their final destination being Lagos, Nigeria. They were 
booked on Ethiopian Airlines flight No ET-661. In Ethiopia, they 
sold clothes and writing materials. They couldn't earn enough 
from that and so they agreed to work as heroin couriers, because 
they could earn much more money much faster. The officials 
turned the suspects and evidence over to investigators at the 
Police Narcotics Control Bureau.

and He Was To Take It to Kamara.''] 
  [Text] Naushahra (Bureau News): An attempt to smuggle 
marijuana into Punjab in a Pakistan Air Force truck was foiled. 
One of the accused tried to escape arrest by jumping from the 
120 foot high Attock bridge and was killed. The other suspected 
smuggler was arrested. According to reported details, Inspector 
Shahzad was on duty with his Customs Special Squad at midnight 
on Sunday and was checking cars near Kand when a military truck 
drove up. The Customs officials signalled to the truck to stop, 
but, instead of stopping, the driver accelerated and tried to 
escape. Inspector Shahzad and his men pursued the truck and 
stopped it near Attock bridge. While Customs agents were 
searching the Air Force truck number 11037, the man sitting next 
to the driver ran out of the truck and jumped into the river 
from Attock bridge, but, instead of hitting water, he landed on 
some rocks and was killed. Customs agents arrested the driver 
and searched the truck. They found a large quantity of marijuana 
in plastic sacks. The truck and driver were taken to Customs 
House in Peshawar where the accused smuggler is being 
interrogated. The [next] morning employees stationed at the 
bridge informed the Akora Khattuck police that a body was found 
under the bridge. The police delivered the body to Naushahra 
hospital. Government identity cards and papers found on the dead 
man showed that the man was an Air Force technician named Ghulam 
Rasoul, son of Mohammad Hussain; he was from Faisal Abad and 
worked at the Kamara Aeronautical Complex. Some 1,665 kilograms 
of marijuana were recovered from the truck; the truck driver, 
whose name is Mohammad Nawaz Mohammad, son of Mohammad Moqim, 
and who lives at Chak Jalaluddin, Rawalpindi, is a senior 
technician at Kamara Complex. The accused has been charged under 
the Customs Act. In an interview with the MASHRIQ correspondent, 
the accused, Mohammad Nawaz, said that earlier he had smuggled 
textiles; that his task was to take the marijuana as far as 
Kamara; his companion Ghulam Rasul was to take over from there 
but he did not know what Rasul was going to do. The accused 
denied any knowledge of the marijuana and said that the truck 
was loaded at Chamkani and he was to take the load to Kamara. 
Air Force personnel arrived to take the accused into custody. 
Certain documents were recovered from the two suspects which 
contain important revelations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Decision To Act Against Smugglers''] </F>
  [Text] Madam Benazir Bhutto has instructed that effective 
steps be taken to control drug smugglers and their business. In 
this context she asked for the list prepared by the caretaker 
government. Drug smuggling has been going on in Pakistan for 
many years, and it is a great hindrance to our economic 
progress. It encourages crime and is also destructive for the 
younger generation. About 15 years ago smuggling was limited to 
hashish and opium; however, shortly after the Russian aggression 
in Afghanistan, heroin was added to this trade. Business 
increased because it is as expensive as gold, and people had 
gonefrom rags to riches overnight. People who are crazy for 
wealth, are not afraid of God, and are ready to risk their 
country, will get into this business to achieve their goals. 
  Over the last 10-12 years, every ruling government has taken 
steps to eradicate drug smuggling. However, because of the 
involvement of some important people in the drug trade, 
especially hashish and heroin, their efforts were not 
successful. Smugglers managed to escape because of their 
relations with some influential people, both at the national and 
international level. 
  In any case, the present government, which was elected by a 
large majority, has openly declared its intent to eradicat this 
curse. It has instructed that effective steps be taken in this 
context. It is expected that these efforts will be successful, 
and that help will be available to stop the smuggling and the 
``crocodiles'' involved in this abominable business. The people 
of this country will definitely help the government in this 
important task.

  [Text] Zambia, which was recently blamed by international 
donors for an alleged increase in drug business, has put into 
force a new anti-drug law providing for heavier penalties for 
drug offenders. President Frederick Chiluba recently signed the 
Narcotics, Drugs, and Psychotropic Substances Act of 1989 which 
gives officers of the Drug Enforcement Commission wider powers 
and latitude to investigate drug trafficking and use. Under the 
new law persons convicted of trafficking in a narcotic drug or 
psychotropic substance will be jailed for 25 years while illegal 
exporters will go in for 20 years. The law slaps a 10-year jail 
term on any person who helps to launder money known to have been 
obtained from illegal drugs business.

  The Zambian finance minister, Ronald Penza, has called on 
President Chiluba to address the problem of alleged drug dealing 
within the cabinet. Mr. Penza said the problem was real and was 
becoming so acute that some Western countries were referring to 
Zambia as the Colombia of Africa. President Chiluba says the 
allegations are unfounded. 
  Several members of Parliament in the governing party, the 
Movement for Multiparty Democracy, have resigned in recent 
months, alleging corruption and drug dealing by government 
ministers. A correspondent for the BBC in the Zambian capital, 
Lusaka, says the president could face a fresh wave of 
resignations if he does not move quickly.

  [Text] In Zambia, President Frederick Chiluba has been told 
by members of his cabinet to dismiss suspected drug dealers 
within their ranks, or face a split in his government. Jennifer 
Wilson has the details: 
  [Wilson] According to the news agency, Reuters, three of the 
26-member cabinet said this week that the drug trafficking 
scandal had reached crisis proportions. They called on the 
president to act immediately. Zambia's leading Western donors 
said at a consultative meeting in Paris earlier this month that 
an end to drug trafficking and corruption was a precondition for 
aid. Zambia already has a balance-of-payments financing gap of 
$96 million for 1994, which donors said they would not cover 
until the government rid itself of corrupt individuals. 
  The ministers said four of their colleagues, whom they did 
not name, were involved in drug dealing. Most of the deals 
involved shipping highly addictive mandrax sedatives from India, 
where they are made, to South Africa. The three ministers said 
their concerns were shared by many of their colleagues, and a 
cabinet walk-out was possible. Chiluba, a devout Christian, won 
a landslide victory in elections in 1991, ousting Kenneth 
Kaunda, who took office on independence from Britain in 1964.

Smuggled to Austria in Car Tank''] 
  [Text] Eric de Zwart (32) has been traveling to Austria 
from his home country, the Netherlands, several times a year to 
sell drugs. 
  The disguise was perfect: In the winter months, he was 
studying to become a skiing instructor. In a number of winter 
holiday resorts, this smart ``sunny boy'' was a welcome visitor. 
He also traveled regularly to Vienna and Lower Austria. 
  Everywhere he was received by ``friends,'' who waited for 
his 
deliveries. The man from Rotterdam had intensive contacts with 
Austrian drug dealers. He sold them hashish that he heat-sealed 
in plastic bags, hid in the gasoline tank of his car, and 
smuggled into Austria. 
  Over the past two years, Eric de Zwart smuggled at least 38 
kg of hashish worth 4 million schillings from the Netherlands to 
Austria. 
  He has now been arrested by Lower Austrian criminal police 
officers at the Walserberg highway border crossing, carrying 4 
kg of cannabis resin. Eric de Zwart was to have handed over the 
drugs to an Austrian dealer at the highway restaurant in 
Mondsee. No information on his contacts has been revealed. 
Detailed investigations are under way.

  [Text] Two men carrying 1.25 kg of heroin with a street 
value of 2.5 million schillings were arrested at the Berg border 
crossing on 17 December. Investigations have revealed that the 
22-year-old man from Vienna's 12th district and the 19-year-old 
man from Boeheimkirchen in Lower Austria bought the heroin from 
a Czech in Bratislava. They paid 300,000 schillings and offered 
the Viennese man's BMW 325i as security. The police are still 
searching for the organizers of the deal. 
  About 800 grams of heroin with a street value of 170,000 
schillings were smuggled by a Tirolian couple from Zurich to 
Vorarlberg since August. On Sunday [26 December], the 
25-year-old man and his 32-year-old girlfriend were arrested at 
the Lustenau border crossing.

  [Text] Drug use is increasing rapidly in the Helsinki area. 
The police and young fieldworkers have noticed a decided 
acceleration in drug use this year and last year. The many 
recent drug seizures attest to the fact. 
  There are more drug addicts in need of treatment than 
before, 
but local governments are more unwilling than before to make 
commitments to pay for those seeking treatment for it. 
Especially badly off are young drug users, for whom there are 
very few suitable treatment centers. In the opinion of social

getting out of hand.

condition whatsoever as long as there is space in the home for 
him. 
  ``We have room for six and we can't increase their number 
unless we get more staff,'' executive director Jussi Suojasalmi 
said. 
  Free of Drugs, R.A., keeps a drug addict until his extended 
treatment is completed. The treatment takes two weeks on average. 
  ``The customers that come here have usually been using drugs 
for a fairly long time and those good feelings that they may 
have enjoyed when they started using them are now over with. 
Some of them are in very bad physical shape,'' Suojasalmi said. 
<H5>  Police Find Only Small Percentage </H5>
  Helsinki Narcotics Police chief Torsti Koskinen can read the 
increase in drug use directly from the statistics. During the 
first half of this year the police arrested 1,385 people 
suspected of using and peddling drugs. During the same period in 
1992, 1,159 were arrested and 889 were arrested in the preceding 
year. 
  During the first six months nearly 70 kg of hashish were 
seized, but a year before only 22 kg. The number of amphetamine 
seizures has increased at nearly the same rate: over 12 kg 
during the first half of this year and about 8 kg a year before 
that. Amphetamine seizures have multiplied nearly 10 times since 
1991. 
  ``Since the police and customs agents seize from 1 to 5 
percent of the drugs circulating in the market, you can judge 
how much there is around,'' Koskinen said. 
  According to police estimates, there are about 12,000 drug 
addicts in Helsinki. Thirty-five hundred of them have committed 
serious crimes. Other crimes are always associated with drug use 
since the drug addict needs a lot of money. Every year the 
police take a sampling of property crimes. About a third of them 
are linked with drugs. 
<H5>  Dealers in Every Part of the City </H5>
  Nowadays drugs are sold in restaurants and bars and from 
home 
to home by telephone. There are dealers in every part of the 
city. 
  There are even a few drug users in the capital under age 15, 
but most of them do not begin before about age 18. 
  Social welfare office youth supervisor Stig Lindholm knows 
of 
cases in which young people pick up the drug habit through 
cannabis. After that, they are told that no one sells it any 
more, but that other drugs are available instead, amphetamines, 
for example. Many of them become addicted to them and the drug 
and crime spiral gets started. 
  Most of the drugs are still smuggled in via the Netherlands, 
but drugs brought in from Russia, Estonia, Poland, and directly 
from the Far East are constantly on the increase. The prices of 
many drugs have dropped, which makes it possible for even more 
people to use them. 
  Heroin dominates more markets since it is now available for 
smoking in addition to intravenous injection. Many users avoid 
needles because of the danger of AIDS, among other reasons. 
Meanwhile, nearly forgotten, LSD has made a comeback on the 
market. 
  ``Many are mixed users. They use various drugs, beer, and 
possibly even medications,'' Koskinen said. 
<H5>  Favorable Talk of Drugs Is Alarming </H5>
  In Koskinen's opinion, favorable talk of drugs is the most 
alarming development. ``I'm appalled by the fact that many 
people want to paint a favorable picture of drugs. This is 
well-received by young people.'' 
  Free of Drugs, R.A., executive director Saini Mustalampi is 
of the same opinion as Koskinen. 
  ``A quite different phase is now in progress than was only 
five years ago. A youth culture that looks upon drugs favorably 
supports the use of a new generation of drugs. The current boom 
will appear in the treatment statistics in about five years from 
now,'' Mustalampi predicted. 
  Rid of Drugs, R.A., family workers receive over 500 
telephone 
calls a year and they cannot handle any more than that with 
their present staff. 
  Stig Lindholm stressed the fact that the use of intoxicants 
is never a cause, but a symptom. 
  ``The problem for many users of intoxicants is unemployment. 
When a person has a job, he has a regular schedule, like others, 
and he feels as though he belongs to something,'' Lindholm 
reflected. 
<H5>  Doctor Sees Only Problem Users </H5>
  Chief physician Antti Holopainen knows that some drug users 
can control their use of them, but the doctor never sees them. 
Holopainen has to deal with only the problem users. 
  ``We don't exactly know the reasons why some people become 
very quickly dependent on drugs while others hold out for a 
longer time. One important factor is the pleasure effect: Those 
who get a feeling of well-being from them look for it again, but 
for some the experience is unpleasant. Since getting high is 
often a communal experience, psychosocial factors are of great 
importance,'' Holopainen said. 
  Most frequently the drug user starts with cannabis products 
and goes from them to other drugs. Very few of them are capable 
of staying with cannabis, which is not ordinarily a 
life-threatening drug, but it alienates the user from reality. 
  ``Cannabis users relate to their environment in an unreal 
manner. They think that they are smarter than other people, but 
it's hard for an outsider to notice that they are. A person who 
smokes hashish generally withdraws into himself and is not 
motivated to do anything.'' 
  Drugs are responsible for about 60 cases of death a year in 
Finland. Users under 20 years of age are now beginning to be 
counted among them. About 75 percent of regular amphetamine 
users die under age 35. Alcoholics do not attain the same high 
mortality rate until they are 20 years older. 
  For Finns the most typical intoxicant is tranquilizer abuse 
and the second most typical is mixed use of medications and 
alcohol. True drugs come only after these. 
  Holopainen is alarmed at the large number of unemployed 
youths because experience shows that heroin use, for example, 
may spread under exceptional circumstances. 
<H5>  Youth Supervisor Recommends Firm Hand </H5>
  Youth supervisor Stig Lindholm is pained when he thinks how 
many young people's lives are in danger of going down the drain 
since there is just no way of breaking the cycle of drugs and 
crime. Altogether too few social workers are serving in the 
field for them to be able to control the situation and the law 
does not yet provide for the possibility of sending young people 
under age 18 with serious intoxicant problems away for 
compulsory treatment. 
  In the opinion of Lindholm, who handles cases involving 
young 
people at the Helsinki Courthouse, there are neither enough 
treatment centers nor are the existing ones the kind young 
people need. 
  ``Many young addicts would seek institutional care if that 
were possible, but local governments are currently more 
unwilling than before to pay for treatment.'' 
  In Lindholm's opinion, young people who wind up on the 
streets cannot be gotten off them with empathy. The worst 
situation is one in which the youth realizes that no one can do 
anything for him. Deep down every young person craves authority. 
  ``Young people caught up in the spiral are mostly good guys 
who might go far in life if they had some other kind of 
incentive.'' 
  Lindholm's dream is some sort of commando group that would 
go 
to the spot immediately when families have problems. It would 
establish a treatment plan and follow through with its 
implementation.

<F P=106> [Article by Matina Fietz: ``Fewer Drug-Related Deaths and </F>
New Heroin Users; More Take Cocaine''] 
  [Text] The number of drug-related deaths in Germany is 
declining. In the first 11 months of this year, 1,458 people 
died as a result of drug consumption. That is a 22-percent drop 
compared to the same period of the previous year when 1,870 drug 
victims died. This was told to DIE WELT by the parliamentary 
state secretary in the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Eduard 
Lintner (CSU) [Christian Social Union], the Federal Government's 
representative in charge of drugs. 
  The number of first-time users has also dropped--by about 10 
percent from 11,892 to 10,724. The largest decline was in heroin 
consumption--down 21 percent. By constrast, the authorities 
registered an enormous increase in first-time users of 
cocaine--up 26 percent. Lintner called this development 
``extremely worrisome.'' The effect of cocaine is often 
underestimated. It leads to a strong psychological dependency, 
to exaggerated sensations and even to extreme overconfidence. In 
addition, cocaine consumption also causes physical 
impairments--from sleep disturbances to paralysis and cardiac 
arrest. 
  Cocaine addicts are very difficult to identify, said Lintner 
as an explanation for the difficulties in coping with the 
problem. Cocaine is primarily consumed by older people already 
well-established professionally. They are no longer to be found 
only in the upper classes, but increasingly also in the 
middle-income groups. They are ``not easily accessible'' to 
offers of therapy. Besides that, admits Lintner, so far there is 
no specific therapy for cocaine addicts, and especially no 
substitute such as methadone for heroin addicts. 
  Lintner rejected the demand that the state dispense drugs 
under medical supervision: ``This practice would mean 
continuation of the addiction. That cannot be the intent.'' The 
goal must be to enable addicts to live a life without drugs.

<F P=106> [Cornelia Block report: ``Three Poppy Harvests Per Year Are </F>
Possible''] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden, December -- ``At some time or other they 
will remember the field. This is a sleeping reserve,'' says 
Volker Brandt, senior official in the ``Drugs'' Department of 
the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] in 
Wiesbaden. He is referring to a plain in the Chu Valley near 
Dzhambul in southeastern Kazakhstan. ``Cannabis is growing 
there on an area of about 150 by 30 km, sometimes interrupted by 
other plants and trees,'' Brandt reports, who got to know the 
region when he visited the country. It is not farmers or 
smugglers who have established a drug plantation there, the 
cannabis is just part of the natural vegetation. The plants 
protect the soil from erosion. Therefore, one cannot simply 
destroy them. By genetically engineering the seeds, it would be 
possible to reduce the plants' active contents to 1 to 2 
percent, he explains. Then they would be uninteresting for drug 
dealers. However, this can hardly be implemented. 
  According to Brandt, poppy, on the other hand, usually does 
not grow in this region. Wherever there are fields, they must 
be established, cultivated, and harvested by farmers. Poppy 
needs regular watering, and water is rare in this region. 
Nevertheless, if someone organized irrigation, it might become 
important that ``the Central Asian republics are predestined for 
the cultivation of poppy. Three harvests per year would then be 
possible,'' he adds. 
  The still harmless cannabis fields are of symbolic value for 
the development in the smuggling, trade, and production of drugs 
in Eastern Europe and in the states of the former Soviet Union 
because of the advantage that drug criminals might soon take of 
the plants. All dealers and smugglers of addictive substances 
consider Europe--just like the United States--as a ``closed 
consumer region.'' The rising number of drug finds during 
checks at the borders of Eastern Europe and at east German 
checkpoints are like a bad omen in the statistics. 
  In contrast to the time before 1989, when the eastern 
borders 
were hermetically sealed, ``new supply lines are developing 
now,'' Leopold Schuster, president of the BKA ``Antidrug'' 
Department, reports. ``The South Americans have recognized the 
new situation, and they exploit it,'' Schuster says. This is 
true, for instance, regarding smugglers' routes via East 
European ports. According to findings so far, the Russian Mafia 
is not yet as active in the drug trade as previously feared, 
Brandt reports. It is rather concentrated on night life--e.g. 
on gambling and prostitution. In the heroin trade it cannot yet 
be seen as a competition for the dominating Turkish drug 
dealers. ``However, as soon as they cannot get anything out of 
the night life anymore...,'' he adds with premonition. The 
profit margin per kilogram of heroin is 50,000 to 60,000 German 
marks. He is worried because the methods of action of the 
Russian Mafia are ``incomparably more frightening'' than those 
of the Turkish drug dealers. The latter use brutality primarily 
in case of disloyal behavior within the groups of criminals. 
  An example of more recent activities by the South Americans 
is the smuggling of drugs via East European harbors at the 
Baltic Sea, Schuster reports. Some of these harbors are less 
risky than Bremen or Hamburg because of the lower ``density of 
checks.'' ``They accept rather complicated roundabout routes,'' 
he says. Rostock has felt that just like St. Petersburg. 
Several times, major amounts of drugs were discovered in the 
east German port. In the meantime, this ``smugglers' gate'' has 
been secured better. Concerning airports, there are also side 
routes, which deviate from the traditional routes. ``Courier 
deliveries suddenly come in transit via Moscow and Prague 
instead of by air via Black Africa,'' Schuster says. In 
addition, there are the drugs that are transported in trucks via 
the ``Balkan route'' and come from the ``Golden Crescent'' and 
Turkey and drugs that are produced in the East European 
countries or states of the former Soviet Union. The so-called 
Balkan route has shifted to the north because of the war in the 
former Yugoslavia. Nowadays, drugs reach Western Europe via 
Istanbul, Odessa, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and the Czech 
Republic. 
  However, the drug investigators react to these developments. 
German liaison officials, who also deal with organized crime, 
have already been detached to Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest. 
These experts are also to be sent to Bratislava, Kiev, Riga, 
Moscow, Sofia, and Bucharest. However, according to Schuster, 
cooperation is not always simple. Even though Germany has 
concluded bilateral agreements--which legitimize and improve the 
exchange of information--with Hungary, the Czech Republic, and 
Poland, and such agreements are being prepared with the Slovak 
Republic, Ukraine, and the Baltic States, this alone is not 
sufficient. 
  Referring generally to the states to the east of Germany, 
Schuster speaks of partly ``not functioning structures.'' In 
addition, in some countries the interlocutors are changing 
constantly. Sometimes there is ``a field of tension,'' which 
results from the competition between the police and the 
intelligence services, which are responsible for organized drug 
crime. Other difficulties are the result of legal 
uncertainties. Schuster describes it as follows: ``They do not 
know what they are permitted to do.'' In Poland, for instance, 
there is a ``large market of amphetamines,'' but there is no 
drug law. Basic substances that come from Western Europe are 
turned into amphetamines in the country, which are not 
prohibited there. Later, the drugs reach the European black 
market as ``XTC,'' for instance. However, he adds: ``But the 
Poles are cooperating with us.'' This summer Polish police 
received several hundred drug test sets from Germany for quick 
checks. 
  How dangerous the production of amphetamines is in general 
and which black markets exist for amphetamines from Eastern 
Europe can be seen in findings by the British ``National 
Criminal Intelligence Service'' (NCIS), which were recently 
published in a report by THE TIMES. The report says that the 
amount of amphetamines seized in Great Britain has risen by 55 
percent compared with 1991. Compared with 1989, it has even 
tripled. Addicts in Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and 
in Scandinavia are considered to be the ``main consumers'' of 
these drugs in Europe. 
  Police and customs officials are trying to counter the drug 
wave through increasing international cooperation. Thus, the 
countries that are located to the east of Germany have meanwhile 
become members of Interpol. Exceptions are only some Asian 
states of the former Soviet Union. The rising exchange of 
technical and specific information benefits all participants. 
In Schuster's view, international legal aid is too cumbersome. 
There may be months of delays. Police are closer to the goal 
of cooperation in Europe than the judiciary. 
  Other clues indicate that training and equipment aid, 
cooperation, and exchange of information are beginning to have 
an effect. This includes teaching scholarship holders in the 
BKA or offering drug courses on site, which take three to four 
weeks. The Germans' foreign colleagues learn, for instance, how 
heroin can be recognized and how they can check suspicious 
substances with a quick test. About 25 persons participate in 
each course. They return to their offices and have a 
multiplying effect, Schuster says. He sees the main problems 
for this kind of police organization in communication and 
mobility. Vehicles, criminal technology, radios, equipment for 
laboratories, and forensic equipment are, therefore, also part 
of the ``help for self-help,'' according to him. This support 
is part of the ``advance shifting strategy'' 
[Vorverlagerungsstrategie] of the Federal Government and the BKA. 
  Courses have already been held, for example in the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria. This summer a press agency 
report about Bulgarian customs noted that by the end of June 
almost 70 percent more heroin was seized than all through 1992. 
Customs says that this is due to improved training of its 
officials, the report stated. In evaluating such reports of 
success, one must take into consideration, however, that large 
finds are mostly also an indication of rising amounts that are 
smuggled. According to Schuster, the United Nations estimates 
that the seized drugs constitute only 10 to 15 percent of the 
entire production. These figures can be calculated because one 
can estimate the harvest yields with relative certainty, he says. 
  In Kazakhstan the combating of drug smuggling--at the moment 
the Republic is primarily a transit country--is still in its 
infancy. Senior BKA official Brandt and other Western guests 
were introduced to an antidrug brigade there. Police depend on 
being given vehicles by the military, for instance; otherwise 
there is little to be had. When they then fly around in old 
military helicopters, everyone knows immediately: ``Ah, the 
antidrug brigade.'' Only when the Kazakh colleagues are lucky 
can they ``catch someone now and then,'' Brandt reports. In 
addition, there is the fact that the country is very large. It 
can ``hardly be controlled with the police forces.'' 
Furthermore, there are no technical possibilities, such as 
satellite monitoring to discover cultivation areas. 
  The BKA drug experts are worried about new cultivation 
areas, 
for example in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. 
Perpetrators from there are pushing on the market--in a 
``relatively uncontrolled'' manner, as it is said. In their 
report about a reconnaissance trip for the UN International Drug 
Control Program through seven CIS republics in the spring of 
1992, the members of the mission came to the following forecast 
for Uzbekistan, for instance: ``Smugglers come from Turkey, 
Georgia, the Caucasus, and Turkmenistan and buy opium from the 
farmers. In smuggling the drugs from Afghanistan to Western 
Europe, Tashkent is used for transit, and smuggling will 
increase as a result of the establishment of new international 
flights to Uzbekistan.'' These factors establish preconditions 
that might lead to a considerable increase in smuggling in the 
near future. 
  From another country of the former Soviet Union the 
``scouts'' of the United Nations report on difficulties in 
training customs officials. They were told that future 
inspectors can no longer use the Moscow customs college, the 
report says. According to this report, in Russia the seized 
amounts of opium (69 kg in 1991; 35 kg in 1990) and cannabis 
(13.4 tonnes in 1991; 8.6 tonnes in 1990) have almost 
doubled--customs has asked for support in acquiring 
drug-sniffing dogs.

<F P=106> [Article by Friederike Tinnappel: ```Not Cocaine, but </F>
Poverty Makes Babies Sick'; In Hamburg, European Cities 
Discussed Their Drug Policy: Experts Warned Against Disparaging 
Certain Substances''] 
  [Text] ``Welcome to the cocaine country of Germany, welcome 
to the cocaine city of Hamburg,'' is how Sebastian Scheerer 
greeted the participants of the fourth conference, ``Drug Policy 
in European Cities,'' which concluded in the Hamburg Congress 
Center on Thursday [2 December]. ``Not even a mile from here, 
coca leaves are piled high in the harbor.'' And as if to make 
belated patent claims, the professor reminded the audience that 
the narcotic, cocaine, had been invented in Germany and was 
produced industrially there for the first time. Scheerer, a 
criminologist at Hamburg University, spoke almost effusively of 
the ``golden age of cocaine'' at the turn of the century, before 
it was outlawed in an international agreement after World War I. 
  Questioning conventional opinions and prevailing thought 
patterns has become a tradition at the annual meeting of those 
cities joined together under the motto, ``European Cities on 
Drug Policy'' (ECDP), to advance a joint liberal drug policy. At 
the 1992 meeting in Bologna, legalization of all drugs had been 
debated; now in Hamburg, the myth of all-destructive cocaine was 
to be refuted. 
  If one may give credence to the experts in attendance, then 
the horror stories about the misery allegedly brought on by 
cocaine and the cocaine product, crack, to entire city sections 
in the United States, are wrong. John Morgan of New York avowed 
that ``there are no crack babies.'' Those underdeveloped infants 
of crack-smoking women, called ``crack babies'' by the media, 
``were the children of particularly poor women--smokers, 
alcoholics--who also consumed cocaine. But the real cause is 
poverty. Morgan summarized the results of a study on ``crack 
babies,'' saying that ``a crack-consuming woman of the middle 
class would have a very healthy middle-class baby.'' But his 
compatriots tended to blame drugs for all social grievances. 
  The drug problem is ``predominantly a problem of the 
underclass,'' was also the opinion of Lynn Zimmer, who had also 
come from New York. ``Drugs are being sold in the streets of 
slums by people who have nothing else to lose. The police can 
arrest them without great ado.'' In the past 10 years, hundreds 
of thousands of these smalltime dealers have been put in prison. 
``No one in the United States believes that the drug problem can 
be resolved that way.'' But it is very difficult for the middle 
class to gain access to drugs as long as the substance is dealt 
only in ghettos. And precisely that is being made into policy. 
  It was said at the conference that, unlike heroin, crack and 
cocaine are not addictive. ``It is easy to stop using them,'' 
John Morgan assured the audience. It has not been proven that 
cocaine causes serious psychological damage, such as psychoses. 
Rather, there are many indications that the people concerned 
already were psychotic before they started using drugs. Scheerer 
advised particularly unstable people against using any drugs, 
``be it cocaine or alcohol.'' 
  But why is cocaine so disparaged? The criminology professor 
had an answer for that, too: The ``political dramatization'' is 
to distract from the fact that there ``are no actual problems'' 
with cocaine users, although there must be thousands who sniff 
the white powder, as one can estimate from the amounts 
confiscated. ``Cocaine consumers are socially integrated.'' 
Horst Bossong, put in charge of drugs by the Hamburg Senat, was 
also of the opinion that ``Europe has no truly serious cocaine 
problem.'' 
  The fact that this drug nevertheless became the subject of 
the conference was justified by Bossong by the hope of not 
having to make the same mistake twice. ``In dealing with 
consumption and consumers, perhaps we should pursue early on a 
policy different from that dealing with heroin.'' Of 12- to 
39-year-old German citizens, in 1990 only 0.8 percent had tried 
cocaine at least once; in a metropolis such as Hamburg it was 
2.5 percent, while in Amsterdam it was 6 percent, reported 
Charles Kaplan of the University of Limburg in the Netherlands. 
Kaplan presented a study on ``cocaine consumption in Europe.'' 
One conclusion: There is a trend that young outsiders, who are 
no longer ``socially integrated,'' use cocaine. Says Kaplan: 
``They need help.'' The study also proves that, unlike heroin, 
there does not have to be perforce a constant increase in the 
dosage, and that there are users who daily, weekly, or at even 
longer intervals reach for cocaine. Far more men than women use 
cocaine; most of them are between the ages of 20 and 40, but 
there are also coke users in the group of 50-year-olds. 
  And according to the experts at the conference, there is a 
difference between exclusive cocaine use and junkies who take 
cocaine in addition to heroin. While the former group ingests 
the white powder through the nose, heroin addicts inject it. But 
even criminologist Scheerer warned against injecting cocaine: 
``That is an entirely different story.'' 
  It is heroin addicts that pose so far unresolved problems 
for 
the cities. Dealing with open drug scenes is the ``acid test of 
drug policy'' for the Hamburg delegate for Labor, Health, and 
Social Affairs, Ortwin Runde (SPD) [Social Democratic Party]. 
The traditional offers of drug help have not reached many 
addicts. But even the so-called ``accepting drug help,'' which 
offers assistance to those affected without making willingness 
to a drug-free life a condition, does not go far enough. Runde 
advocated controlled heroin disbursement and the establishment 
of ``health rooms,'' where drugs can be consumed under sterile 
conditions and without time pressure. The first ``fixer rooms'' 
countrywide are to be opened in Hamburg in January 1994. The 
politician emphasized the importance of cooperation among cities 
which--unlike lawmakers--are directly afflicted by the drug 
problem. ``No city alone can implement the necessary radical 
first steps.'' That is why the ``city conference'' has developed 
into an international reform movement. 
  In addition to the 15 European cities which already 
cooperate 
firmly, two dozen other communities had sent delegations to 
Hamburg. For the first time, some southern German cities were 
also represented which up to now had endorsed a traditional, 
repressive drug policy. Also for the first time, London was 
there. Excluding the public, the discussion focused on how, in 
dealing with open drug scenes, a balance could be struck between 
repressive measures and offers of help, ``so that politicians 
really say what they think,'' stated one of the female 
organizers. That widely diverging opinions were represented in 
the debate, in the opinion of Swiss legal expert Joerg Schild 
was due to the fact ``that some cities have not yet done their 
homework.'' But even in Switzerland, where new ways have been 
tried for years and where, at the beginning of 1994, model 
attempts at controlled heroin distribution will start, one must 
admit: ``None of us have found the ideal solution.''

<F P=106> [Andrea Pucci report: ``Prefect and Crime Boss--Group </F>
Photo--Storm Clouds over SISDE''] 
  [Text] Rome -- A new storm is threatening SISDE 
[Intelligence and Democratic Security Service]. Following the 
snaps of [President Scalfaro's daughter] Marianna Scalfaro and 
architect Adolfo Salab in the Via del Babuino, images which one 
suspects of being inspired by 007s, another photograph is 
causing embarrassment to the Interior Ministry's civilian secret 
service. It is the one depicting SISDE's number two, Prefect 
Antonio Barrel, at the baptism of the son of a supposed 
narcotics traffic boss, Maurizio Martina from Puglia. The photo 
is in a dossier opened by public prosecutors Leone De Castris of 
Brindisi and Francesco Mandoi of Lecce, who hold most of the key 
information in the investigation into the Pugliese narcotics 
trafficker. For the time being the two prosecutors have not 
taken any measures. Nonetheless, the prefect's presence at the 
ceremony is raising serious questions both outside and inside 
the Interior Ministry. 
  Barrel was appointed SISDE deputy director on 3 June last, 
after heading the Brindisi Prefecture since 1991. On arrival at 
the capital of the Messapian region, he was immediately 
confronted with the invasion of the Albanian ``boat people,'' 
20,000 of whom landed on the Pugliese coast that year. Apart 
from the refugee emergency, the prefect got himself in the 
limelight by proposing to the Interior Ministry that it suspend 
local councillors and introduce initiatives against contraband 
and the practice of hiring local youths for criminal purposes. 
  Employed by the Interior Ministry in 1953, appointed questor 
in 1982 (in Naples, where he remained three and a half years), 
Barrel was called to SISDE immediately after the scandal of the 
reserved funds, earning the acclaim of Interior Minister Nicola 
Mancino (``He was indeed a good choice'') and PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left] member Luciano Violante, chairman of the 
anti-Mafia committee (``In Brindisi he succeeded in giving an 
extraordinary impetus to all the administrative departments 
reporting to him''). 
  Whilst Barrel was in this long-vacant office, the Salento 
region police came into possession of a compromising family 
album belonging to Maurizio Martina, not just a Mr. Nobody in 
Brindisi. According the weekly L'ESPRESSO, Martina is known for 
``the unscrupulous nature of his financial dealings, his 
widespread and at first glance unjustifiable property holdings, 
and for being related, through his wife, with the U.S. bosses: 
His wife's daughter married a member of the Gambino family.'' 
  Arrested together with a Turk and a Pakistani, with whom he 
is suspected of narcotics trafficking on a vast scale, leading 
to the seizure of 60 kg of heroin, Martina invited Barrel and a 
well-known Pugliese politician, Socialist member Biagio Marzo, 
former chairman of the bicameral commission on state 
participation in industry, to his son's baptism. In the photos, 
the prefect and Marzio appear, holding the newly born child at 
the time of the baptism. 
  Whilst the Pugliese magistracy is trying to shed light on 
the 
activities of Martina and his friendships ``above all 
suspicion,'' the enquiry continues in Rome into SISDE's black 
funds. Yesterday former civilian secret service Director 
Alessandro Voci was interrogated at length. The prefect denied 
ever having appropriated funds or having ``paid a salary,'' as 
head of the 007s, to the then Interior Minister Enzo Scotti. 
Also interrogated for five hours was his predecessor at the 
head of the service, Riccardo Malpica, who replied to all the 
judges' questions. 
  Meanwhile, from his secret refuge, one of the SISDE 
officials 
still hiding from justice, Michele Finocchi, threatened legal 
action and denied presumed links between financiers linked to 
the Magliana Band [crime gang] and the service's cover-up 
company. ``The only company in which I have an interest,'' 
Finocchi stated, ``is the one which is the registered owner of 
the apartment in which I am living.'' Finally, a meeting is 
scheduled today between Prince Rainier of Monaco and the 
capital's well-known criminal lawyer Nono Marazzita, 007 
Maurizio Broccoletti's defender. At the center of the 
discussion, which will take place at the Monte Carlo Royal 
Palace, is the extradition request issued by the Italian 
authorities.

11 Years''] 
  [Text] Stockholm--Eight members of a gang that has traded 
large amounts of cocaine were sentenced on Tuesday [30 November] 
by the Stockholm City Court. The principal, a 29-year-old Swede, 
was sentenced to 11 years in prison for, among other things, 
aggravated drug crime. The other persons involved got varying 
sentences, from nine years in prison to suspended sentences. The 
network was uncovered in the spring of 1989, when two young men 
were caught at Arlanda airport with 4 kilos of cocaine in their 
baggage. The police were able to determine that the men had 
brought the drugs from Colombia, where a 25-year-old Stockholm 
resident had begun a trade in cocaine with Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Carlberg: ``Drug Quantities Increasing''] </F>
  [Text] The flow of narcotics to Sweden could be on the 
increase. According to the National Criminal Police, it is 
definitely clear, at least, that the shipments sent to Sweden 
are getting bigger. 
  Customs and police have made major drug confiscations in 
recent weeks. That in itself might not mean that the supply is 
larger, but other observations are pointing in that direction, 
according to the National Criminal Police. 
<H5>  33 Kilos of Hashish in Varberg </H5>
  Last Sunday three persons were arrested, a Dutchman and a 
man 
and a woman from Zaire, residents of Belgium, suspected of 
having tried to smuggle one kilo of heroin by way of Helsingborg. 
  Last Saturday a Belgian car driver was seized in Varberg 
with 
33.6 kilos of hashish in his baggage, the next largest hashish 
confiscation made in Sweden this year. During November, customs 
in Helsingborg also found a total of 9 kilos of amphetamines 
with various travelers. 
<H5>  Thin Evidence </H5>
  The heroin confiscation over the weekend is one of the 
largest in Sweden, although, according to the Criminal Police, 
it would scarcely affect the market. The three have been 
arrested, suspected with probable cause of aggravated narcotics 
crime and attempt at aggravated smuggling of goods. 
  According to what SVENSKA DAGBLADET has found out, the 
evidence against the three, who claim innocence, is thin. The 
customs made a routine check of the bus and found a plastic bag 
of heroin in the vicinity of the seat where the Zairian woman, 
who says she was on her way to Oslo, sat. 
  The Zairian man has said he wants to come to Sweden to seek 
political asylum. Evidence against them is, among other things, 
their mutually contradictory information. Apparently, they also 
know each other despite eager protestations to the contrary. 
  On the street in Stockholm 1 kilo of heroin costs about 1 
million kronor, about 900-1,000 kronor a gram. The purchase of 1 
kilo at a wholesaler in the Netherlands usually costs less than 
50,000 kronor. 
  According to Bengt Widlund, a detective with the Criminal 
Police Intelligence Service, access to heroin is good right now 
in Stockholm. He does not believe there is a boom at present; it 
goes in waves throughout the year. 
<H5>  Smoked Heroin a Concern </H5>
  ``The development is worrying, but it is still too soon to 
say whether it is just temporary. What might perhaps be a 
concern is the increasing flow of brown, so-called smoking 
heroin,'' he relates. Addiction and dependence take place 
extremely quickly and there is no problem getting hold of it. 
  Smoking heroin comes from southwest Asia, while the 
``ordinary,'' white heroin comes from the Netherlands, Belgium, 
Russia, and the Baltic states. 
<H5>  Hashish Making a Comeback </H5>
  According to Widlund it is also disturbing that hashish is 
making a comeback. Last year's decline, as a result of measures 
by the Danish police, who carried out raids in Christiania, and 
Dutch police, who unraveled several large networks and got the 
hashish in the bargain, has been reversed. 
  The struggle against amphetamines is being conducted with a 
certain measure of success, however. A large part of the 
amphetamines that are sold in Sweden comes from Poland, but for 
some time the Swedish police have liaison persons in place in 
Warsaw and are cooperating intensely with the Polish authorities.

<F P=106> [Article by Lova Olsson: ``Forced Treatment Without Effect''] </F>
  [Text] The forced treatment of heavy drug users in the city 
of Stockholm has a very bad effect. 
  Most of them continue to use narcotics after the treatment 
period--although the most important objective of the expensive 
care is to break the destructive addiction. The mortality among 
those who have recently been released from an institution is 
instead ``remarkably'' high. 
<H5>  More in 1993 </H5>
  This is the gist of a study, so far unpublished, of the 
effects of drug treatment recently carried out by social medical 
officer Gunnar Agren, research head of the research and 
development bureau of the Social Service. 
  But in spite of this, considerably more drug addicts have 
been placed in Stockholm's so-called LVM [Addict Treatment Law] 
center during 1993, compared to last year, according to 
information from the Social Service's treatment bureau. 
<H5>  Harsh Criticism </H5>
  Compulsory treatment--which in part is supposed to break a 
serious addiction and in part motivate the addict to treatment 
under voluntary forms--is subjected to harsh point-by-point 
criticism in the R&amp;D bureau's report. Gunnar Agren even 
proposes 
a reevaluation of existing legislation, which would either lead 
to abolishing the law or to more restricted application of it. 
  ``Forced treatment is simply catastrophic. I believe it is 
very doubtful whether it has the effect it is supposed to have 
according to the intentions of the law. The data quite clearly 
show that the lifesaving effect does not exist but rather the 
opposite. The question is then whether one should spend so many 
resources on the absolutely most expensive form of treatment,'' 
says Gunnar Agren. 
  In his judgement the result of the Stockholm study can also 
be applied to the country as a whole. 
  The number of drug-free persons six months and one year, 
respectively, after their institutional stay is below 10 
percent, according to the three different studies of five LVM 
centers which Gunnar Agren uses as his basis. Mortality is high; 
at one of the treatment centers studied as many as 12 percent 
died within a year after being released. 
  For injection addicts of heroin, in particular, forced 
treatment has bad effects. The institutional stay, which costs 
up to 3,000 kronor a day, has not contributed to a single heroin 
addict losing his addiction to drugs. 
  ``There has been an increase in the number of heroin addicts 
who are subjected to forced treatment, although it is completely 
obvious that it is a meaningless form of care.'' 
<H5>  ``Nerve-Racking'' </H5>
  Bitte Davidsson, chief of the Social Service's treatment 
bureau, says that these results are not fun to hear. 
  ``It is sad that we have not succeeded in demonstrating less 
destructive ways. It is terribly nerve-racking to see that 
forced treatment does not lead to anything. But it is the final 
safety net, and the alternative to people dying immediately.'' 
  There are several explanations for the fact that the number 
of LVM placements has increased during 1993, at the same time as 
the number of placements in treatment centers has decreased, 
according to the treatment bureau's Bitte Davidsson. A stay at a 
treatment center can, for example, be a way to avoid future 
mandatory treatment, in her opinion. 
  ``These kinds of things must lead to reevaluation. Is this 
the way we want to use our money? It would be considerably 
cheaper if we employed effective measures much earlier.'' 
  At present the city of Stockholm operates eight LVM centers 
with a total of 257 places. Last year, the city's total costs 
for addict treatment decreased and that trend has persisted in 
1993 as well, according to the situation and action reports of 
the Social Service. The explanation is, among others, that 
treatment periods have become shorter and that the social 
districts to an increasing extent are investing in open care, 
which is considerably cheaper.

  [Text] The Mafia was directly linked to drug smuggling into 
Britain for the first time after the seizure of a quarter of a 
tonne of cocaine, worth 70 million pounds sterling, Customs men 
said tonight. 
  In a major international operation, anti-Mafia investigators 
in Rome tipped off British Customs and Excise officials about a 
plan to smuggle Colombian cocaine. 
  ``The job was the province of the police in Rome,'' a 
Customs 
and Excise spokesman said. ``We were simply asked to look out 
for the shipment.'' 
  The anti-smuggling operation started last Wednesday when 
the Colombian merchant vessel, Maipo, docked at Felixstowe in 
Suffolk. 
  Customs men were already in position and watching as a 
container with specially-adapted hiding places was unloaded at 
the dock. 
  The spokesman said: ``This was a very large haul and quite a 
coup. This is the first confirmed involvement of the mafia in 
drugs smuggling into the UK. 
  ``Normally the drugs are brought in direct without the 
involvment of third parties in other European countries.'' 
  The drugs operation involvied customs and police forces in 
Italy, England and Colombia. 
  As the British end of the operation continued, two Italians 
were arrested and 850 kilos of cocaine were seized in Sicily. 
  Italian anti-Mafia investigators said the bulk of the 
shipments were from Colombia's notorious Medellin cartel. 
  At Felixstowe, Customs officials arrested three men. Two 
appeared at Ipswich Magistrates Court today charged with drug 
smuggling and were remanded in custody. The third was released 
on police bail.

<F P=106> [Article by Artak Chagharyan: ``Combating Drug Addiction and </F>
Drug Trafficking in a Systematized Manner: Meeting at the 
Offices of the Republic of Armenia Vice-President G. 
Harut'yunyan''] 
  [Excerpts] On 21 August a conference dealing with drug 
addiction and combating alcoholism was held at the offices of 
Vice President Gagik Harut'yunyan of the Republic of Armenia, 
attended by the following: Republic of Armenia Minister of State 
Armen Ghazaryan; Karapet Rhubinyan, head of the oversight agency 
under the President of the Republic of Armenia; Avet Grigoryan, 
member of the Supreme Council's Permanent Commission on Health 
and Social Issues; plus all ministry and agency representatives 
whose work deals with these fundamental issues. 
  In his opening statements the vice president noted that much 
effort is being expended on this problem, which is of serious 
magnitude. Of great concern is the fact that at the present time 
drug abuse is spreading rapidly, particularly among students. 
According to a public-opinion survey, 83.7 percent of those 
polled consider this to be a very serious problem. Fifty-four 
percent responded in the affirmative to the question ``Are there 
any drug abusers among those people with whom you associate?'' 
  ``This meeting should not be the last one to address this 
issue,'' said Mr. Harut'yunyan. ``It is essential to carry out 
fundamental and consistent work efforts.'' 
  The participants in the conference presented their views on 
the subject. 
  Republic of Armenia Minister of Health Ara Babloyan stated 
that last year his ministry had submitted to the government a 
number of proposals aimed at resolving these fundamental issues. 
Serious work continues to be carried out jointly with the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. The 
conviction was expressed that an individual agency working 
separately cannot achieve results. Mr. Babloyan stated, ``There 
is a need for a systematized plan, implementation of which calls 
for the creation of a special commission (taking international 
experience into account) under the president, vice president or 
prime minister. The ministries of health, justice, internal 
affairs, education, and social services, the public prosecutor's 
office, as well as public organizations and organizations 
dealing with the dissemination of information must be involved 
in these projects.'' 
  The minister went on to state that as of 1 January 1993 
there 
were 1,113 registered drug addicts, 796 of whom were enrolled in 
a medical help program. Drug addict figures break down as 
follows: 0.01 percent are 18 years of age or younger; 50 percent 
are between 19 and 30; 31 percent are from 31 to 40 years of 
age; 14.5 percent are between 41 and 50; and the remainder are 
over 50. Forty-seven percent of the total are blue-collar 
workers, 10 percent are white-collar workers, and 3 percent are 
students. At the present time there is a 150-bed drug addiction 
treatment center in Yerevan. There is a similar 50-bed facility 
in Gyumri, plus 47 offices in various rayons and cities in this 
republic. Much attention is being devoted to the question of 
drugs produced in this republic as well as drugs brought in from 
elsewhere. Mr. Baboyan noted that this issue was seriously 
addressed at a recent meeting held with Minister of State A. 
Ghazaryan. A decision was made to hold a special conference 
dealing with the issue of habit-forming drugs and narcotic 
substances. 
  Sergey Aslanyan, chief of the of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs directorate which deals with drug trafficking and 
combating drug abuse, discussed the work being done by his 
directorate and its results. He particularly stressed Operation 
Poppy-93, in the course of which a large quantity of narcotic 
substances was discovered and seized. He noted that the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs considers it essential to pass a new law, 
which should specify a number of important provisions: drug 
addiction must be differentiated from drug trafficking, and 
Article 44 of the Code of Administrative Violations must be 
revised. Mr. Aslanyan also stressed the importance of 
establishing a special coordinating commission. 
  Artavazd Gevorgyan, chief public prosecutor of the Republic 
of Armenia, noted that certain groups are engaged in drug 
trafficking for purposes of financial gain. Judicial practice in 
the past has been quite severe in this regard. ``At the present 
time we must apply existing laws, and therefore we must first of 
all uncover these criminal enterprises,'' said Mr. Gevorgyan. In 
1992, for example, 162 crimes were reported but, according to 
the prosecutor, ``who knows what percentage this represents of 
total crimes--probably a very small percentage.'' One hundred 
eighty four crimes have been reported during the first seven 
months of this year. Mr. Gevorgyan is convinced that these 
numbers will grow unless all of us concentrate our attention on 
this area of criminal activity. It was reported that all rayon 
and city prosecutors have received instructions to cooperate 
with and assist the 4th Directorate of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. 
  Hayk Harut'yunyan, chief of the State National Security 
Directorate of the 3rd Main Directorate, stated that his 
directorate works in the area of identifying and neutralizing 
groups involved in drug trafficking. They consider it essential 
to close down those routes by which narcotic substances are 
being brought into this republic. An extremely important element 
here is the problem of ``open borders.'' The State National 
Security Directorate considers it essential to draw up and enter 
into a bilateral agreement dealing with drug trafficking and, 
together with counterpart agencies in other interested 
countries, to establish a permanent body which would exercise 
oversight, as well as to establish a data bank. It is considered 
to be of utmost importance to provide weapons and equipment to 
agencies combating drug trafficking and drug addiction.... 
  [Paragraph omitted] 
  In conclusion, Republic of Armenia Vice-President Gagik 
Harut'yunyan noted that the campaign against drug addiction and 
drug trafficking in this republic will in fact assume new forms 
and new attributes. We shall find ourselves in a grave situation 
if we continue to proceed as before, if under conditions whereby 
changes have taken place around us we fail to have at our 
disposal a comprehensive system. Of serious concern is the fact 
that at the present time an organized campaign is not being 
developing and that we are short of equipment. 
  Mr. Harut'yunyan commented that it is impossible to solve 
the 
problem through punishment alone and by merely taking 
administrative actions. He stressed the importance of national 
dignity, the factor of education of youth, and of effective 
publicity. 
  ``There are at least two things which should not exist: 
begging and drug addiction,'' said the vice-president. ``Perhaps 
these two are not comparable to one another, but both are alien 
to our national character.'' It is absolutely essential to 
eradicate the causes of this evil. For this reason the 
establishment of a substantial, well-designed program is 
considered a prerequisite. It is very important that each and 
every citizen realize that he cannot stay outside this campaign. 
Widespread publicity is essential: the people must understand 
the enormous danger presented by drug addiction and drug 
trafficking. Mr. Harut'yunyan stated that 52 percent of those 
polled gave an affirmative reply to the following 
sociologically-oriented question: ``Are you concerned that a 
child or relative of yours is a drug user?'' 
  Mr. Harut'yunyan noted that, unfortunately, drug abuse is 
widespread in the schools: not as regards level of drug 
addiction, but rather the fact that a large number of young 
people are trying drugs. 
  The situation has become calamitous at higher educational 
institutions: a large number of students not only try drugs but 
develop a need for them. ``At the most highly-disciplined higher 
educational institutions, even drug abuse is of a widespread 
nature,'' said the vice-president. ``The fact is that we do not 
have working mechanisms within the educational system.'' A 
situation of inertia continues in the field of medicine, 
involving narrower and more costly means of combating drugs. At 
this point Mr. Harut'yunyan stressed the importance of 
differentiating drug addicts from those involved in drug 
trafficking, whereby the former, who are sick, must be given an 
opportunity to become cured, while the latter must be severely 
punished. 
  ``We should not allow the problem of drug addiction and drug 
trafficking to develop into a full-blown drug mafia, for 
otherwise we shall not be able to root out this phenomenon,'' 
said the vice-president. 
  Gagik Harut'yunyan then proposed that all submitted 
suggestions and questions formulated at the conference be 
reviewed and further developed. Within one week's time they 
should be submitted to the President's staff, in the process of 
which all suggestions and proposals should be systematized and 
computerized through the efforts of government and the 
president's staff; he proposed that Vice-President of the 
Republic of Armenia G. Harut'yunyan, Minister of State of the 
Republic of Armenia A. Ghazaryan, and K. Rhubinyan, head of the 
oversight agency under the president of the Republic of Armenia, 
be tasked with summarizing all suggestions and proposals and 
submitting them at the next meeting, which would take place in 
two weeks time....

<F P=106> [Article by Armine Ohanyan: ``Drug Addiction Is a Growing </F>
Evil''] 
  [Text] I heard about drug addiction for the first time 
during my student years, when I unexpectedly found out that the 
father of a respected, cultured family had himself acquired 
narcotic substances for his adult son with a family of his own 
(in order to protect him from bad batches and other dangers). As 
amazing as the story is, it is also emotion-charged. The subtext 
noted the almost magical, devastating power of the so-called 
narcotic substance. 
  Questions linked to this monstrous phenomenon, however, are 
not in the center of the public's attention at the present time. 
These issues are constantly being passed over in a kind of 
sickening fear or puzzling silence. In elite circles even 
talking about this terrible ailment is looked upon as ignorance 
of refined conduct and decency, as a manifestation of bad 
manners. It is essential to talk about it, however. It is 
essential, since in the opinion of people who deal with this 
issue, who are intimately familiar with the problem, it is 
growing to an international level, is directly threatening the 
future of our nation, and places in question the very 
preservation of our genetic resources. The Directorate for 
Combating Drug Trafficking and Drug Addiction of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs has avoided releasing statistics on this 
problem, citing as a reason the fact that this directorate was 
just recently formed (``It has not yet been in existence even a 
year. We are just beginning to develop record keeping 
mechanisms''), as well as the fact that the figures of different 
agencies are not in agreement with one another (public 
prosecutor's office, Ministry of Health, etc), that figures fail 
to show the true picture, etc. Agencies have refused to draw 
parallels or make comparisons with previous years (on the basis 
that the true picture had been falsified in the past). They have 
noted, however, that the number of drug addicts in Armenia in 
relation to the size of the territory and population is quite 
substantial, very close to being characterized as disastrous. 
David Mantashyan, a section chief in the directorate, has 
stressed the decline in employment and moral decline as reasons 
for this phenomenon. Especially the second factor: an 
abandonment of moral standards, decline in the desire to study, 
and a worshipping of money. The moral decline has reached a high 
point today: there is no social blame, and therefore virtually 
everything is permissible and tolerable. As a consequence there 
has been a severe increase in drug addiction among young 
females. The age group 20-22 is most susceptible to drugs, 
although the first signs begin to appear between the ages of 15 
and 16, when the emerging young adult is more vulnerable, is 
highly curious, and is in a hurry to ``live,'' to enjoy the 
pleasures of life. 
  The professionals have explained that the rapid growth of 
drug addiction in Armenia is due to a number of factors, first 
and foremost among which is Armenia's geographic location. The 
fact that Armenia lies at the crossroads of transit routes on 
the shortest well-traveled route linking Asia with Russia and 
Europe is an adverse factor in this regard, playing a most 
favorable role in the spread of drug addiction. The easiest and 
most profitable route for moving drugs to Russia and Europe from 
the Golden Crescent countries (Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan 
-- the principal suppliers of drugs) runs through Armenia. The 
route to Russia from Central Asia crosses four national borders, 
while the route through Armenia crosses only two. Another route 
leading to Europe--through the Balkans--is closely under 
surveillance by Interpol and other organizations. And, most 
important, in the Balkans drug trafficking brings severe 
penalties, while in Armenia the maximum penalty is 10 years in 
prison (while in Iran, for example, one can expect the death 
penalty for possession of 5 grams of hashish). The laws in 119 
countries specify the most severe punishments for drug 
trafficking, up to and including the death penalty. 
  As a consequence of failure to enforce the law and due to 
Armenia's convenient geographic location, as well as due to a 
lax job performed by the customs service and due to the war 
situation, Armenia has become a transit country for the 
transport of drugs, a country which has readily taken upon 
itself the ``thankless'' role of transporter of narcotic 
substances. At this end of the route they find out about the 
transported drugs when they reach their destination and are 
discovered at that point. The Directorate for Combating Drug 
Trafficking and Drug Addiction proposes to assign personnel to 
the customs service, to the international airport and 
border-adjacent areas for the purpose of assisting customs 
officials. The directorate should work in cooperation not only 
with the counterpart CIS agencies, but also with its 
opposite-number agencies in foreign countries, including the DEA 
in the United States. Many years of experience have been amassed 
in combating drugs at the world level. There exist 
well-developed mechanisms and agencies, and specialized 
organizations with drug interdiction personnel and drug sniffing 
dogs are maintained, but their effectiveness has not yet reached 
a satisfactory level. We, on the other hand, show a less than 
urgent attitude toward this important international problem. 
  Opium and hashish make their way to Armenia from Central 
Asia 
and Azerbaijan. Last week, on 13 August, a criminal gang was 
arrested in Gyumri, a gang which had for quite some time been 
transporting large quantities of narcotic substances to Armenia. 
On this occasion 30 million rubles worth of opium had been 
brought in from Turkmenistan (one of those transporting the 
drugs was an Armenian female). Drug trafficking provides 
``businessmen'' with extreme profits (as a rule these 
``businessmen'' do not use drugs themselves). A single kilogram 
of opium purchased abroad for 3000 rubles is sold for 15-16 
thousand rubles, generating a 400-500 percent profit. 
  By decision of the Supreme Council this past May, Armenia 
acceded to an international convention to combat drug addiction. 
The process of bringing the campaign in Armenia into conformity 
with the requirements of the convention has now commenced. First 
of all, international experience must be taken into 
consideration. A draft national plan to combat drug trafficking 
is presently being formulated: it provides for the formation of 
certain structures, legislative enactments to assist the efforts 
of government agencies, and the securing of participation by 
public organizations and the press. Drug rehabilitation clinic 
activities must also be restructured with this aim in mind, as 
in the current situation the clinic is hard put to conduct 
effective treatment activities. It is also essential to 
establish a rehabilitation center. Effectiveness of treatment 
has been very poor to date, due to the lack of such a center, 
since treatment ends up by necessity being incomplete. 
  Requirements of the international convention include 
revision 
of legislation and separation of drug addiction from drug 
trafficking in a country's laws. Drug addiction should be viewed 
as a sickness and should be treated, while drug trafficking 
should be punished more severely. Application of penalties up to 
and including the death penalty is anticipated, as well as 
standardization of penalties (for example, for illegal 
possession of 100 grams of an illegal narcotic substance, 
punishment runs anywhere from a monetary fine to three years in 
prison). Sergey Aslanyan, head of the Directorate for Combating 
Drug Trafficking and Drug Addiction, is convinced that combating 
drug trafficking must begin with making the law stricter and 
with ``cleaning up'' internal affairs agencies. It is essential 
to put an end to the widespread abuses and illegal actions 
connected with drug trafficking which for years were carried out 
by law enforcement agencies. The campaign will never be 
successful, however, without the participation of the public as 
a whole. The fact is that members of the public, with a false 
sense of love of their fellow man and in the fear of being 
labeled a ``squealer,'' are in fact carrying out betrayal of the 
entire nation and its future. Even today 20 percent of all cases 
involving drugs come to the attention of authorities through 
telephone calls, including anonymous tips. The fight against 
drugs is not that of one individual or of a few individuals, but 
is a common fight by all of us. The enemy will not readily yield 
or surrender. And we must make haste, before Armenia is engulfed 
by the evil monster of international drug trafficking.

  [Text] By order of Eduard Shevardnadze, the State 
Commission for Combating Drug Addiction and Drug Trafficking has 
been created in Georgia. The commission is made up of the heads 
of the power departments and also the health and education 
ministers. 
  According to data supplied by the Georgian Internal Affairs 
Ministry, to date over 60 percent of Georgian young people are 
using drugs. This was a report supplied by the IMAPRESS agency.

``Drug Trafficking Increase?'' -- first paragraph published in 
boldface] 
  [Text] According to the news center of the State Customs 
Committee of Ukraine, between 4 and 10 December alone, customs 
services confiscated over 25 kg of marijuana (not including 
other drugs). Over 11 months of this year, only 28.5 kg of 
marijuana were seized. It seems that the worst prognoses begin 
to be corroborated. 
  During the same week, 518 actions against smugglers and 
violators of customs regulations were brought to court; customs 
officers confiscated foreign currencies worth over 1.5 million 
karbovanetses, precious metals worth 283 million karbovantses, 
and nearly 50 million Russian rubles.

  [Text] Negotiations with the United States over the targets 
for the eradication of coca farms will not be resumed for three 
months. 
  Gaston Martinique [no title given] informed us about 
existing 
and future agreements. 
  Martinique: There is an agreement that will remain 
in force until March. The Bolivian Government has committed 
itself to eradicating 4,500 hectares. I am deeply satisfied to 
report that so far we have fulfilled the second target of the 
agreement. We have eradicated approximately 2,350 hectares. 
  Reporter Amalia Pando: Gaston, what amount will 
the United States give as credit in return for this, although 
this is not actually a credit but a donation, sort of 
compensation, right? 
  Martinique: It is a fund of approximately $40 
million, which supports the balance of trade. They disbursed $10 
million after we fulfilled the first target. Now that we have 
fulfilled the second target, we expect disbursement of another 
$10 million installment, and the remaining $20 million before 
March. 
  Pando: To start from scratch after March? 
  Martinique: Right. At that time we will design the 
new targets under the new policy that I described to you, a 
policy of agreement and coordination with coca growers. 
  Summing up, to date the government has fulfilled only 50 
percent of its eradication commitment, and it has only three 
months to eradicate the other 50 percent, that is, 2,200 
hectares. The government is confident this will be done through 
a policy of agreements with coca growers. 
  This will decide the fate of $20 million the United States 
will deliver to the Bolivian Central Bank. 
  According to Martinique, the alternative development policy 
will be maintained. In 1994, this policy will demand investments 
of $25 million, which the government will obtain from foreign 
countries and international organizations interested in the 
replacement of coca farms.

  [Text] The largest criminal organization in the country 
conducted a demonstration of force early this morning. In a 
bold operation, 30 drug traffickers of the Red Command invaded 
the Engenho Novo Police Precinct in Rio de Janeiro and rescued 
38 inmates from the cells. 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The gang closed 24 
de 
Mayo Street, one of the busiest in the outskirts of Rio de 
Janeiro. The group comprised 30 men, armed with rifles and 
machine guns, who wore civilian police vests. The seven 
detectives who were in the precinct were taken prisoner and 
handcuffed. The gang opened cells and released the 38 inmates. 
The gang took all the weapons from the police precinct and even 
used a police vehicle to escape. A man who was riding a 
motorcycle in the area was beaten. Within 30 minutes more than 
100 policemen had begun the search for the gang. The 
shantytowns of surrounding areas were cordoned off but only two 
inmates were recaptured. Another inmate was found dead in a 
street close to the precinct. He was a police informer who was 
murdered by the gang. 
  The police knew that the order to take over the police 
precinct came from drug trafficker Atlas Ferreira, aka Adam, one 
of the principal Red Command chiefs and a drug trafficking 
leader in the Vigario General shantytown. The police believe 
the main objective was to rescue one of the gang leaders, Luiz 
Carlos Goncalvez who has been sentenced for homicide, assault, 
and kidnapping, and who was to be transferred to a high security 
prison today. The police were impressed with the boldness of 
the gang. As they left, they fired shots in all directions 
leaving marks on the walls and scaring the neighborhood. One 
shot entered the window of the house next to the precinct.

  [Text] Government Minister Fabio Villegas angrily 
complained today to Valle Governor Carlos Holguin for describing 
a weekend operation against the Cali Cartel as a failure. The 
governor said that Villegas' complaint was offensive. 
  The controversy between the two ranking officials began as a 
result of a letter that Holguin sent to Police Director General 
Octavio Vargas rejecting the way in which an operation against 
alleged drug traffickers was executed in Cali. 
  Villegas responded to the criticism and said that the 
delivery of suspected drug-trafficking criminals cannot lead to 
a decrease in operations. 
  In addition the minister said that in this type of operation 
one cannot judge about any inconveniences caused, and he added 
that he does not understand the motive of any official who 
criticizes the authorities involved in these operations. 
  In another letter Governor Holguin has said that the 
complaint was offensive and that he rejected any attempt to 
disregard him, because he was not questioning the operation as 
such, rather, the way in which it was executed, a way, Holguin 
said, that only guaranteed the failure of the operation.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Jan (AFP) -- The American 
troops who occupy Bahia Malaga in Valle Department in the 
country's southern Pacific coast area are preparing to establish 
a military surveillance complex to watch the Pacific seaboard, 
the morning newspaper LA PRENSA of Santa Fe de Bogota reported 
today. Under the headline "Marines Know How To Radar"--a play 
on the Spanish words equivalent to radar and swim, which sound 
similar in Spanish--LA PRENSA says the United States will 
install radar sites which will be connected to the radar network 
already installed in Central America. 
  The arrival of between 120 and 150 U.S. soldiers, who, 
according to the Colombian Government, started to arrive on 28 
December as part of a civilian project construction agreement, 
has aroused a lively controversy among political leaders. The 
government says the U.S. soldiers' presence deals with the 
construction of schools, health posts, and several kilometers of 
roads in Juanchaco on the Pacific coast. LA PRENSA, however, 
has reported: "The U.S. Marines in Bahia Malaga intend mainly 
to conduct preliminary studies for the construction of a complex 
network of radar sites at a place regarded by the U.S. 
Government as the most strategic on the Pacific Ocean, near the 
Panama Canal." 
  Citing a report from its special correspondent Fernando 
Cortes, LA PRENSA, an opposition conservative paper, says the 
first radar site would cover from Bahia Solano on the coast to 
Panama and would link up with radar sites installed in Central 
America and the Caribbean, including Colombian-owned San Andres 
island. The paper continues to say that with these sites the 
Pentagon seeks to curb drug trafficking in the Pacific because 
the Governments of Colombia and the United States have for a 
long time been aware of the growing number of Cali Cartel routes 
in this area. 
  LA PRENSA further adds that 36 U.S. engineers are already in 
Bahia Malaga and that others are scheduled to arrive aboard 
several Black Hawk helicopters today. "They will be flown in 
directly from the Southern Command in Panama, and along the 
Humboldt current, in very covert flights to avert new incidents 
with the public if Colombian radar discovers them," LA PRENSA 
said.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Romeo Melara Granillo said the 
lack of a radar system to detect illegal aircraft and the 
numerous clandestine landing strips left from the war have made 
El Salvador a "paradise stopover" for drug traffickers. 
  Melara Granillo added, however, that experience shows that 
continuous pursuit can lead to heavy blows against drug 
trafficking, such as those delivered by the Drug Interdiction 
Executive Unit [UEA] in 1993. The unit reported five major 
seizures totalling 2.3 billion colones worth of cocaine. 
  The official told LA PRENSA GRAFICA that "had we not 
intercepted the drugs, they would have harmed thousands of 
people, if not in our country, surely in those for which it was 
bound. This is not only a violation of human rights but a 
violent attack against the victims who have fallen into the 
clutches of this world-wide plague." Melara Granillo believes 
drug trafficking is primarily an insidious activity in pursuit 
of absolutely selfish, evil purposes. He acknowledged that drug 
trafficking is highly profitable but said such economic benefits 
are immoral. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office is well aware of its 
position 
regarding drug trafficking. It is making painstaking efforts to 
fight this enemy with the law to see that those responsible are 
tried and punished with the full force of the law. 
  Melara Granillo has been prosecutor general for five and 
one-half months now, during which he has confirmed the seizure 
of 121.598 million colones worth of cocaine. The drugs were 
intercepted at El Pulido landing strip in Melara Canton, La 
Libertad Municipality. 
  He has also certified the seizure of a second shipment worth 
700 million colones at the San Jorge industrial complex on the 
road to San Antonio Abad in San Salvador. A third seizure took 
place 42 km off the coast of Puerto Acajutla, Sonsonate, and 
included a total of 300 million colones in drugs. 
  The prosecutor general pointed out that never before has 
there been such a relentless pursuit in El Salvador but added 
that there are many clandestine landing strips remaining from 
the war. There is no radar system to detect illegal aircraft. 
Melara said "this is a paradise stopover that the armies of 
drug traffickers have taken advantage of, because they have the 
technological and economical resources to operate in countries 
such as ours." 
  He indicated that despite all the institution's efforts, it 
still faces serious financial and personnel limitations when the 
ideal scenario would be for it to grow so as to face the 
challenges of 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy by </F>
anchorwoman Stella Ruffinelli during the weekly "Coordenadas" 
program from the presidential residence--recorded, no date given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Ruffinelli: Let us 
talk about what is probably a more conflictive, but unavoidable, 
issue. Why do people believe [Army Commander] General Lino 
Oviedo has so much power in the country. Is it just their 
imagination or does he really have so much power? I am asking 
you this question in your capacity as commander of the Armed 
Forces. 
  Wasmosy: I would say that he is a very active 
person. Within the Armed Forces he is probably the most 
concerned about his subordinates. This attitude is probably 
interpreted by some as if he were the most powerful person 
within the Armed Forces. However, looking you straight in your 
eyes I can tell you I have never had any problems with Lino 
Oviedo. I, personally, here in my office, filled in the posts 
of the Armed Forces organization chart. First I worked on it 
with [Military Forces Commander Vice Admiral Eduardo] Gonzalez 
Petit, then with the Army, Navy, and Air Force Commanders and 
the chief of the joint staff. The logistics commander was also 
present on some occasions as was [Division General Pedro de la 
Cruz] Ocampos, the chief of staff. They can confirm that the 
appointments were made directly by me. 
  I would like to refer to those remarks that so-and-so was 
appointed because it will help Oviedo or that so-and-so is 
against so-and-so, and that sort of comment. I can show you the 
service record, the military law, and the seniority list, and 
you will see that I have respected the officers' seniority and 
their merits. So much so that the commanders of the 
engineering, transmission units are the best there are. Nobody 
can accuse me of having discriminated against anybody who was 
the top of his class. By no means. Why do you think they 
respect my decisions? Injustices surface sooner or later. 
  Ruffinelli: What many people question is the 
possible political actions of Gen. Lino Oviedo. 
  Wasmosy: Do you consider it to be political action 
when he helps each and everyone in his home town by building a 
school, giving social assistance, and so on? I regard it as 
absolutely normal. Now, if he stood up and said he wants to be 
president of a Colorado Party precinct or that so-and-so must be 
appointed, etc., yes, that is engaging in politics. I would 
really like all my aides to help me. I am being frank and must 
say that many commanders--within their jurisdiction--do so. Not 
long ago we dedicated social projects with General Barreto, the 
Curuguaty commander. When these ceremonies occur in rather 
distant regions and there is no transportation, the media just 
do not turn up. 
  Ruffinelli: When there is no means of 
transportation? 
  Wasmosy: This is probably why these ceremonies are 
not covered sufficiently. But they are all doing their best to 
increase the level, to humanize the Army. Soldiers and 
sergeants currently live like human beings. These activities 
are criticized because it is always...[changes thought]... well 
this is the price of being the Army commander, this is the price 
I have to pay for being president of the Republic. As a means 
of consolation, and to give myself a bit more courage, when I 
receive criticisms which I accept happily--well, not happily but 
which I tolerate... 
  Ruffinelli: Let us talk about that later... 
  Wasmosy: ...which I tolerate, because we must be 
frank, I tell myself they are directed against the president of 
the Republic. Juan Carlos Wasmosy is president of the Republic, 
but only temporarily. Every criticism is directed against the 
leader, against the authority. That is only normal. It happens 
within the Army, religious congregations, among bishops and 
cardinals, right? For example, you women sometimes complain 
about your husbands, because they are the boss at home. 
  Ruffinelli: Of course. Well, we will see who is 
the boss. 
  Wasmosy: Well, in some cases the husband is the 
boss. 
  Ruffinelli: Engineer, sometimes Gen. Oviedo's 
actions--which may be done in good faith--are questioned. There 
is a very narrow margin between proselytism, campaigning, and 
engaging in politics. As you well know, this is banned by the 
Constitution. Right from the beginning of this interview you 
have said that your main concern, your main goal is to respect 
the Constitution. Is there any chance, if he were to engage in 
politics, that .... 
  Wasmosy: If Gen. Oviedo were to engage in 
politics, let us say seeking to obtain a post within a party 
precinct, that is one thing. 
  Ruffinelli: I don't think he will go that far. 
  Wasmosy: That situation would justify your 
criticisms, but if he is only helping the government--to which 
the Armed Forces belong--implementing social projects because 
you should recall that the Army... 
  Ruffinelli: Do you believe he is acting in good 
faith? 
  Wasmosy: I believe he is acting in good faith. 
What is more, I have no complaints against him. I believe that 
to have the Army cooperating as it is now, guarantees this 
democratic process. 
  Ruffinelli: Why? 
  Wasmosy: Because the Army will not tolerate 
anything that violates the Constitution. People believe that we 
will only live in democracy through the downfall of the Colorado 
Party. We are proving that the Colorado Party brought democracy 
back to the country and that it is consolidating this democratic 
process. People also say that free elections and democracy are 
not possible until Lino Oviedo is not discharged or retired. 
[sentence as received] That is not true, young lady. Quite the 
opposite. Let us look at things positively. I believe the 
Colorado Party and an institutionalized, well organized, 
rationalized Armed Forces are the best guarantee to consolidate 
our democracy. This is not a story, I am absolutely convinced 
of what I am saying. 
  Ruffinelli: Engineer. Changing the subject and 
referring to another subject that has surfaced... 
  Wasmosy: I don't know whether I am passing your 
test. 
  Ruffinelli: I am not testing you. We want to 
share this moment with the SNT listeners throughout the country 
during the last few days of this year. I want to raise another 
important topic which has been a matter of concern lately: drug 
trafficking and money laundering and the U.S. Government's 
concern reflected in a press communique written and signed by 
[U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay] Jon Glassman. What do you have to 
say about this? 
  Wasmosy: There are three aspects to this problem. 
There are countries that consume drugs, produce drugs, and 
others that act as routes for drug trafficking. Let us hope our 
country is not used as a route between producer and consumer 
countries. 
  Ruffinelli: This is what we are being accused of. 
  Wasmosy: It would be regrettable if our youth 
became hooked on this really lamentable vice. I have repeatedly 
and publicly stated that I am in favor of a total struggle 
against drug trafficking, money laundering, and I am against 
those who kill to steal, who traffic in stolen vehicles, etc. 
  I believe Ambassador Glassman made a rather hasty comment 
when he stated that honest people have been replaced by 
dishonest people, yet failed to say who the dishonest people 
are. One cannot make groundless charges. I respect him in his 
capacity as ambassador but, as long I am president of the 
Republic, I will not allow him to interfere in the domestic 
affairs of this country. Paraguay is a small but sovereign 
country. 
  There is a lot of talk about obscure situations, that 
so-and-so is involved. If people provide me with evidence I 
will dismiss the guilty parties. I have already removed several 
people involved in the contraband of cigarettes, chickens, and 
onions brought from Brazil or Argentina, but one cannot make 
groundless charges and suspect everyone. Do people not trust 
me? I have proven I am trustworthy. I want to tell the 
listeners that I summoned Ambassador Glassman to Government 
House together with [Alternate Senator Eustacio] Morel Garay and 
General Escobar Anzoategui [National Antinarcotics Secretariat, 
Senad, executive secretary] and told him that if he wanted to 
know anything about the Senad he should ask General Escobar and 
not Morel Garay or anybody else because there is a chain of 
command that must be respected. We cannot tolerate intervention 
at the various levels. Either you have trust or you do not. I 
cannot decide if a person is involved in drug trafficking or 
money laundering if I do not have evidence. If you tell me who 
is guilty of these crimes and bring the evidence against the 
person then it is my responsibility to follow it up, but in the 
meantime I cannot prejudge. 
  Ruffinelli: Engineer, please allow me to mention 
some figures that are of concern to the U.S. Embassy which, as 
you known, is a landmark in international affairs. They say 
that during the past years we have only managed to seize a few 
kilos of cocaine, I think it was 48 kg or a similarly small 
figure: meanwhile neighboring countries talk about tonnes. More 
than 30 Paraguayan citizens charged with drug trafficking or 
consumption have been arrested abroad, but this has not happened 
here. This is out of proportion. 
  Wasmosy: There are two alternatives. Either drug 
trafficking has dropped here or the entire government is 
involved in this trade. Therefore, to uncover the government 
officials involved in this trade I need the necessary means. I 
have asked them to install radar units in Mariscal Estigarribia, 
Ciudad del Este, Concepcion, and Ayolas and to provide two 
helicopter-gunships operated by U.S. Marines. What better proof 
is there than that to show I want to fight this scourge openly? 
  Ruffinelli: However, they maintain that when you 
list the aid received you do not mention the DEA agents who use 
the infrastructure exclusively designed to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  Wasmosy: That is right but the U.S. Embassy has 
also included in the global aid granted us the cost of bringing 
an aircraft with radar [AWACS] to our country. I am grateful to 
them for this aircraft but the decision to send it here was 
theirs. They cannot charge the cost of sending an aircraft 
equipped with radar to the aid granted to Paraguay. They are 
trying to determine the origin of this nefarious merchandise 
which is consumed in their country. They cannot charge this 
cost to the aid granted to us. That is a U.S. expenditure or 
investment, not a Paraguayan expenditure. No. If they were to 
really grant us support and we did not fight drug trafficking, 
then we would be guilty. But with what budget can I fight these 
people who are much better equipped with more sophisticated 
weapons than what our Army has. They have money to buy the most 
sophisticated weapons. We have discussed this subject with the 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay. This must be a joint 
effort with the aid of the United States, which is the greatest 
drug consumer. The United States must help us. What can we do 
alone or in an isolated manner? 
  Ruffinelli: Engineer Wasmosy, do you know how this 
is being interpreted? Jon Glassman, to some extent, has warned 
that the funds obtained from money laundering and drug 
trafficking may become a very strong political power that is 
very hard to eradicate. 
  Wasmosy: I fully agree with him. 
  Ruffinelli: What worries him is the impunity that 
may currently prevail in Paraguay and that is generating a 
system of privileges that may even undermine the democracy we 
are currently enjoying. 
  Wasmosy: This risk not only exists in Paraguay, it 
exists in any South American country. 
  Ruffinelli: We are no exception. 
  Wasmosy: We are no exception. Do you think it was 
easy to catch [Colombian drug trafficker Pablo] Escobar, or do 
you think he was a sort of superman that flew from one place to 
another? How do you think he got out of prison? There is the 
answer to your question. [passages omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez from the "Research Unit"] </F>
  [Text] Peruvian Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, alias 
"Vaticano," and Colombian Waldo Simeon Vargas Arias, alias "El 
Ministro"--two of the greatest drug traffickers in the 
country--have held a top-level meeting seeking to end 
confrontation between their two groups and to set the basis for 
a possible initial agreement to organize the first Peruvian drug 
cartel, Colombian style. 
  National Police Antinarcotics Board sources have said that 
these two criminals are responsible for 60 percent of the drugs 
that are sent to Colombia for direct distribution by the Cali 
Cartel. 
  The meeting was held during the end of September, supposedly 
on the Colombian border, following an extended dispute initiated 
by "Vaticano," who tried to remove his competitor from the 
extensive coca territory he dominates between Pongo Isla, San 
Martin Province, Department of San Martin, and Lagunas, Upper 
Amazonas Province, Loreto Department. 
  The Peruvian trafficker handles the main drug operations in 
the Upper Huallaga, namely in Aguaytia, Sion, Saposoa, and 
Campanilla, San Martin Department. 
  The substantial difference between the two, according to 
U.S. 
Embassy antinarcotics officers, is that "El Ministro" is one of 
the greatest buyers of cocaine paste while "Vaticano" is fully 
occupied transporting drugs to Colombia. 
  The same sources reported that both are independent, but 
work 
directly with the Cali Cartel, headed by the brothers Gilberto 
and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. 
  Skirmishes between the two mafia bosses reportedly began on 
the orders of "El Ministro," who wanted to pay less for the drug 
than the high price paid by "Vaticano" in his area of influence. 
  The Peruvian established a price of $800 per kilogram of 
cocaine paste, while the Colombian was offering only $600, and 
this enabled him to purchase larger quantities. 
  But the coca producing peasants began to sell to "El 
Ministro" in spite of the lower price he was offering because 
transporting the drugs to the distant places where "Vaticano" 
purchases the drug by speedboats represented additional cost and 
risk due to the presence of security forces which have increased 
control in the zone dominated by the Peruvian drug organization. 
  The confrontation became more heated due to the growth of 
"El 
Ministro's" business who, from being a purchaser, began to work 
in the most profitable business of shipping large amounts of 
drugs, thus poaching on "Vaticano's" turf of transporting the 
paste abroad. 
  "El Ministro" was becoming "Vaticano's" most dangerous 
competitor when the latter, from El Sauce where he had 
established his general headquarters, moved to Pampa Hermosa, 
Upper Amazonas Province, Loreto Department. 
  In El Sauce, where there is an important landing strip, "El 
Ministro" joined the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, MRTA, 
to obtain their protection. When the Army moved in, the 
trafficker tried to bribe the head of the detachment, an officer 
known as "Juan Pablo," but even so the trafficker and the 
subversives were expelled from the area. 
  The Colombian has a very good nose for the drug business. He 
began early in the 1980's as a "mule" of the Medellin Cartel 
branch in Leticia, Colombia, which was headed by Evaristo Porras 
Ardila, but immediately began his own business. He found that 
coca plantations were increasing considerably in the provinces 
of Upper Amazonas, Loreto, and San Martin, San Martin Department. 
  Coca plantations increased considerably because of the 
migration of colonizers and peasants who, coming from the Upper 
Huallaga, were forced to leave their coca plantations because of 
the National Police antinarcotics units. 
  The cocaine paste tablets produced by the peasants of 
Shanusi, Alfonso Ugarte, Yumbatos, Jorge Chavez, Shapajilla, 
Bonilla, Sargento Lores, Pintoyacu, Copal, Carachama, San Juan, 
San Miguel, Naranjal, Davilsillo, Nuevo Lamas, and 
Pintoyaquillo, were taken to Pampa Hermosa, San Martin Province, 
Upper Huallaga, the main collection center for the region. 
  But the clandestine airport between km 40, by the bridge 
over 
the Shanusi River, and Pampa Hermosa was destroyed by the Air 
Force. 
  This incursion prompted an increase in the security forces, 
preventing the normal flow of drug flights to Colombia. 
  "El Ministro" then moved from the depleted market of Pampa 
Hermosa to Huimbayoc, his new drug collection center. He made 
Pongo Isla his general headquarters and Yarina his center of 
operations because it has an airport with official permit. In 
this area the people do not have the money even to move around 
in boats, but there are air-taxi companies that render services 
to that town. 
  Pongo Isla then was renamed Leticia by the Colombian 
trafficker, in honor of the people from his country where Porras 
Ardila taught him the art of drug trafficking. 
  By making Huimbayoc his collection center, "El Ministro" 
recovered the power he lost by abandoning Pampa Hermosa. He now 
purchases coca paste from the peasants of Pucalpillo, Progreso, 
Miraflores, Paraiso, Yarina, Navarro, Reforma, Inayuca, Alto 
Coritayacu, Dos de Mayo, Santa Marta, San Francisco, Santa Zona 
Matador, San Antonio, Guineayoc, and others. 
  An unexpected event stopped "El Ministro's" dangerous bull 
run. On 15 May, a group of agents from the National Police 
Command from Upper Amazonas, Yurimaguas, entered his operations 
center in Pongo Isla and arrested him, his girlfriend Isolina 
Mansilla Acosta, alias "Charito," and two of his henchmen. 
  "El Ministro" was taken aboard his own boat to Yurimaguas 
where in a matter of hours he reached an agreement with his 
captors: He paid $100,000 for his freedom. 
  After lengthy investigations by the National Police 
Inspector's office and by the Antinarcotics Board with the 
cooperation of the Upper Amazonas Provincial Control Department, 
the bribed policemen were jailed, fired, and are currently 
facing trial. 
  The Colombian continued his business following this sudden 
fright but convinced peasant defense patrol members from coca 
production districts like Huimbayoc and Navarro to provide him 
with protection. 
  So much so, that when a National Police antidrug patrol 
arrived in Huimbayoc on 16 August, the peasant defense patrol 
members welcomed the security forces who arrived by helicopter 
with gunfire. 
  Two members of the defense patrols died in the shootout and 
97 kg of cocaine paste and a large amount of chemical precursors 
were seized. But Isolina Mansilla Acosta, alias "Charito," 
daringly accused police agents of attacking private property and 
of murdering peasant defense patrol members. 
  Ironically, the peasant defense patrols were provided with 
weapons by the Huallaga Front headed by Peruvian Army General 
Eduardo Bellido Mora. Dinandro [Antidrug Division] Report No. 
162-DADAH-SL, dated 10 August that is, six days before the 
police incursion states: "(Waldo Simeon Vargas Arias) is 
reportedly living in Huimbayoc and Navarro, Tarapoto Province, 
San Martin Department. He would be living with Isolina Mansilla 
Acosta. They purchase large amounts of drugs, approximately 10 
tonnes, to be processed and transported aboard clandestine 
planes to Colombia." 
  The report adds: "The traffickers reportedly rely on the 
support of townspeople and peasant defense patrol members to 
provide them with security in all their activities, using long- 
and short-range weapons." 
  A high-ranking Dinandro source has confirmed the 
intelligence 
report obtained by his agents concerning the support to 
traffickers by some peasant defense patrols who were armed by 
the Army. 
  The source said: "Like in Upper Huallaga, the traffickers 
want to lead the people against the security forces. They have 
achieved this to a certain extent," adding: "For this reason, 
there must be better control of the peasant defense patrols, 
especially those that received weapons from the state." 
  As if the police action were not enough, "El Ministro" 
received an unexpected attack from "Vaticano's" Pongo Isla 
fortress. He was forced to flee, leaving on the road two of his 
henchmen murdered by "Vaticano's" group. 
  The Colombian then settled in Pelejo, another collection 
center with a clandestine airport and surrounded by coca 
plantations cared by the people of Papaplaya, Rumiyarina, San 
Luis, Santa Elena, Asuncion, Caimito, Pamplona, Pelejillo, and 
mainly Reforma. 
  After no more than a month in Pelejo, another incursion by 
"Vaticano" forced him to move further north, to Lagunas, yet 
another trafficking stronghold. 
  But "El Ministro" is no fool. He knew his competitor was on 
his heels and, before leaving Huimbayoc, he left the brothers 
Carlos Enrique and Miguel Angel Farro Perez to run the business 
in Lagunas. The first task was to refurbish the run-down Lagunas 
municipal airport to transport the drugs. 
  When the Colombian arrived in Lagunas everything was ready. 
The Farro Perez brothers had signed an agreement with the 
municipality of Lagunas to repair the airport in exchange for 
installing a branch of the Halcon aero-taxi company. Once the 
airstrip became operational the sleepy jungle district was 
revived because of the traffickers' flights. 
  "El Ministro" knew the Farro Perez brothers would not fail 
him because, among other things, they are his relatives. 
  The Colombian drug trafficker's girlfriend, Isolina Mansilla 
Acosta, was born in Rupa Rupa, Huanuco, on 3 June 1959. She is 
the sister of Sara who is the wife of Enrique Farro Perez, the 
Halcon aero-taxi representative in Lagunas. But that is another 
story. 
  A Dinandro intelligence report dated August 1993 states that 
the Colombian gang involved in "the exploitation of cocaine 
paste for international trading" includes "Isolina Mansilla 
Acosta and the individuals known as `Gatillo,' `Nacional,' 
`Caballo,' `Lancero,' `Montana,' `Gorgojo,' `Memo,' `Boquita,' 
`Tiburon,' `Dangelo,' `Miguel,' `Ventiuno,' `Balde,' `Cone,' and 
`Sierrita.'" 
  Also mentioned in the report are "`Gato,' `Tony,' `Dios 
Mio,' 
`Cocharun,' `Brea,' `Canillita,' `Lucho Buho,' `Juanito,' 
`Harry,' `David,' `Negro Izula,' `Micky Martin,' `Chino,' `Don 
Marcos,' `Hueso,' `Frejolito,' `Comadre,' `Pirulin' (who is 
known as one of the most blood thirsty Colombian hired killers 
in the zone), `Chevas,' `Pizana,' `Pelbes,' `Ripio,' `Jazmin,' 
`High Mariel,' `Burro,' `Elastico,' `Mascara,' `Lambayecano,' 
`Chocho,' `Coro,' `Percy,' `El Popular Coco,' `Percy,' `Coro,' 
`Marcos,' and `El Ciego.'" 
  When "El Ministro" arrived in Lagunas he found the airport 
ready to transport the drug elaborated by coca producers in 
Shambuyacu, Tiphisca, Miraflores, Santa Cruz, Providencia, 
Pucate, Naranjal, and other neighboring areas. 
  Following this recovery by "El Ministro," the Peruvian 
citizen "Vaticano" could do nothing but close an agreement and 
yield to the pressures of his Colombian bosses. 
  A report compiled in Lagunas said that a light plane with a 
Colombian license number landed at the recently repaired 
airstrip around 1800 during the middle of September. The plane 
carried the pilot and one passenger, whom some people identified 
as "El Ministro's" brother. The individual carried a message 
from the Cali Cartel: Waldo Vargas Arias had to negotiate with 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera to avoid threatening the drug supply. 
  From that date "Vaticano" was unable to touch the 
Colombian's 
business between Pongo Island and Lagunas while "El Ministro" 
would not buy drugs in Campanilla, Saposoa, Aguaytia, and Sion, 
which are the Peruvian areas of influence. 
  At the same time it was agreed that "El Ministro" would 
continue to operate more as a drug collector than drug 
transporter. 
  In exchange the "Vaticano" allowed "El Ministro" to contact 
Shining Path leaders in Upper Huallaga to hire their protection 
following disappearance of the MRTA from the area. 
  For the two drug traffickers, this was an agreement for the 
equal distribution of business. No one knows how long it will 
last because "El Ministro" becomes stronger every day and 
threatens to remove "Vaticano." 
  In light of the actions by the antinarcotics forces, the two 
drug traffickers may join forces to establish a stronger 
organization with a unified command and an army of hired killers 
like the Colombian cartels. 
  To confirm if the agreement is being fulfilled, "Vaticano" 
sent two of his hired Colombian killers--"Chuck Norris" and 
"Rambo"--to the area under the control of "El Ministro." They 
periodically report to him details of the movements of his 
competitor. 
  The first Shining Path flags appeared in Puente Shanusi at 
km 
40 of the Yurimaguas-Tarapoto highway two days before the 
referendum. Just 10 days ago new flags were raised by 
subversives in Pampa Hermosa and Alianza announcing their 
presence and showing the power of "El Ministro."

  [Text] Swift contact between the Peruvian and Colombian Air 
Forces permitted the detection of a light airplane belonging to 
Colombian drug traffickers in Peruvian territory. FAP [Peruvian 
Air Force] fighters destroyed the plane because its crew refused 
to obey the orders of the Peruvian military pilots. The 
Colombian plane, a "Turbo Commander" with forged license 
OB-2113, was destroyed at an illegal airstrip 20 km southeast of 
`Palma Pampa' (Ayacucho), while loading bags of drugs. 
  The plane was spotted thanks to Colombian radar operating in 
that country's jungle. Through a radio message Colombian 
authorities passed the information on to their Peruvian peers. 
  It was established that the plane entered Peruvian territory 
from Brazil, between Iquitos and Leticia, flying at 22,000 feet, 
that is, at 7,000 m. 
  After the plane was spotted in Peruvian airspace, the FAP 
high command in Huallaga immediately sent two fighters to 
intercept it. The fighters took off from the Santa Lucia police 
antinarcotics base and headed for Luisiana (Ayacucho). When the 
plane was spotted it was loading bags of drugs and fuel for a 
trip to Colombia. 
  The FAP planes fired machine-gun bursts, which caused the 
plane to catch fire. The plane was destroyed. At the airstrip 
there were at least 15 people supporting the crew. 
  This is the 11th small plane belonging to drug traffickers 
that the FAP has destroyed over the past few months.

  [Editorial Report] Lima EXPRESO in Spanish publishes in its 
22 December 1993 edition on page A15 a 700-word article by 
"special correspondent" Liz Mineo on her visit to poppy 
plantations near Jaen, north of Cajamarca. 
  Mineo reports visiting poppy plantations in Chontali, Jaen 
Province. According to a local peasant, she says, "Colombian 
citizens came along with people from Juanjui" and "taught local 
peasants how to extract opium from the poppy seeds, and they 
promised to return to buy their production at $1,500 a kilo." 
  Mineo continues: "Many peasants from the northwestern 
Maranon Region are willing to cultivate poppies." A Chontali 
peasant told her that since "we live from what we plant, we will 
not doubt in planting this." 
  She adds: "It is obvious that if the demand for poppy seeds 
grows, poppy plantations, which are now a few, will expand." 
Poppy cultivation is "in an incipient stage" in Jaen Province, 
but according to experts, "soil and climate conditions" in some 
places of Cajamarca are "ideal" for this kind of plantation. 
  According to the Peruvian Antidrug Division, Mineo states: 
"Poppy plantations were detected in Yanacanchi Valley in 
Cajamarca in 1991 and on the border between Piura and Cajamarca 
in 1992." 
  She concludes by saying that she "learned through sources in 
the 5th Jungle Infantry Division based in Bagua, Amazonas, of 
poppy plantations in Tabaconas District in San Ignacio Province 
in Cajamarca." From sources in the Huallaga Front political and 
military command she learned that "trading of a brown substance 
identified afterward as poppy latex has been detected in the 
past few months in Chiclayo."

  Bailetti: If one considers the letters of [SL 
leader Abimael] Guzman--which almost admit surrender--and 
reviews the last letter, signed by Abimael and four [SL] Central 
Committee members, one can see that the terrorist group is 
obviously breaking into factions. Since this organization began 
its bloody war, the appearance of a dissident group represents 
an unprecedented move... 
  Ponce: Who would be heading this dissident group? 
  Bailetti: It could be that this group would be 
headed by Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand (Feliciano) ["Comrade 
Feliciano"]... 
  Ponce: Are there any clues in this regard? 
  Bailetti: Police work will confirm this 
possibility. 
  Ponce: Do the actions by the SL in Lima follow the 
activities of the four zonal committees? 
  Bailetti: This is true. Following the capture of 
the SL top leaders, the terrorist group established four zonal 
committees in each one of Lima's cones [conos]. The SL actions 
in Ancash Department are also significant. Its December actions 
confirm this. Another group continues to be active in Satipo 
Province in the Ene Valley zone... 
  Ponce: Are there any differences between the 
latest SL actions and those commanded by Guzman? 
  Bailetti: The main difference is that today's SL 
people have diminished economic resources because they are no 
longer financed by drug traffickers. The Huallaga committee has 
been acting on its own for a long time. The Huallaga committee 
and the traffickers are currently moving toward the south of our 
country on the Aguaytia-Ene Valley axis. 
  Ponce: From the way you describe the situation, 
Guzman has not been heeded by the majority of the militants who 
are free? 
  Bailetti: This is not necessarily true. Some 180 
SL militants killed three SL leaders and then surrendered under 
the Repentance Law in the Sello de Oro zone in Ayacucho 
Department. 
  Ponce: What is your prognosis for the future of 
the SL? 
  Bailetti: I believe it will break into three 
factions: The Huallaga militants, who are moving to the south as 
drug traffickers also move in that direction; those who will 
continue with their armed actions; and, finally, those who will 
obey Guzman's call. 
  Ponce: So, what is the balance of the negotiations 
between the government and Guzman? 
  Bailetti: There is no room for any negotiation 
here. We are facing a decimated, cornered, and penniless force. 
There is nothing to compare the situation that once prevailed 
in Colombia or El Salvador where negotiations were a national 
necessity.

<F P=106> [Article By Samuel Blixen] </F>
  [Text] The persistent and constant pressure exerted by the 
U.S. Federal Reserve on banks to discourage money laundering 
have resulted in the surfacing of substitute mechanisms to 
bypass control measures. 
  In our country's case, the State Department's repeated 
charges that our banking system has inherited the role played by 
Panama changed the mind of the banking authorities who refused 
to implement control mechanisms and lift bank secrecy. Thus, 
money laundering operations through bank branches dropped 
noticeably (the latest cases made public involved the Santander 
and Lloyd's banks, linked to the Yomagate scandal [involving 
Argentine President Carlos Menem's sister-in-law]). The bank 
branches were replaced by some money exchanges on which U.S. 
organizations in charge of repressing illegal financial 
transactions focused their attention. 
  Money exchanges also were forced to operate more "openly" 
when the Central Bank of Uruguay extended some of the control 
mechanisms to this field. Once in a while the money exchanges 
appeared involved in money laundering, as in the recent case 
involving the Indumex [expansion unknown] money exchange, used 
to launder capital amassed in Brazil through a colossal 
corruption and influence peddling scheme. 
  However, the operators of ill-gotten money have had to find 
new discreet methods to launder their money in view of the risks 
they run due to the control measures implemented by DEA agents, 
the IRS (the office in charge of fighting tax evasion), and U.S. 
Customs. The freedom to carry out financial transactions in our 
country, in this sense, offers a new and flourishing mechanism: 
the surfacing of corporations engaged in intermediary 
activities. 
  Leaders of the banking union have just charged CADISA, 
Investment Management Company, Inc., one of the most important 
of these corporations in Uruguay, with money laundering. 
CADISA's trade is better known as Citicorp's "Citicarteras" 
[investments portfolio]. Citicorp, in turn, is the international 
corporation of the Uruguayan government's main creditor bank: 
Citibank. 
  If one believes banking sources, one could presume that 
Citibank, through Citicorp, has managed to complete the circle. 
CADISA's operations are considered a typical financial 
intermediary. It attracts savings that, in turn, are invested 
in banks operating in Uruguay with clauses in the contracts 
noting that all risks are run exclusively by the client. 
  This allows CADISA to carry out risky operations, depositing 
the money in saving accounts or buying "money baskets" in those 
banks that offer the best interest rates for investments. 
Citicarteras, preferably, operates with government-intervened 
private banks and the public banking sector, especially the 
Mortgage Bank. 
  It is estimated that Citicorp, during the 18 months it has 
been operating through CADISA, has accumulated $100 million 
worldwide. Many of its clients do not reside in Uruguay. 
  Citicarteras offers a high return in exchange for a 
commission. In addition to the rates--which are an incentive 
despite the risk it represents--there is another benefit: the 
full concealment of the operation because CADISA, not the 
client, deposits the money in the bank. In other words, the 
client enjoys complete secrecy, something that not even the 
banks enjoy. This is feasible because since CADISA is a 
corporation, although it carries out typical intermediary 
financial operations, it is not subject to Central Bank control 
measures. 
  This abnormal situation reported by the AEBU [Association of 
Uruguayan Bank Employees] still has not prompted a declaration 
by the Central Bank management. The subject was discussed 
recently but the Central Bank postponed any decision on the 
subject. Central Bank President Enrique Braga, through his 
public relations manager, declined to make any comments on the 
issue. 
  Union sources told BRECHA that the facilities Citicorp 
enjoys 
allow money laundering. Citicorp carries out similar activities 
in Argentina, where the National Securities Commission has 
sanctioned the holding [preceding word in English] "due to its 
dubious operations" and "irregularities in its activities." 
Citicorp in Argentina during the past two years has focused on 
the purchase of public enterprises earmarked for privatization 
and owns 28 percent of Cointel [expansion unknown] shares and 33 
percent of the Zapla Iron and Steel Industry in partnership with 
the Spanish Telephone Company and Techint [expansion unknown]. 
  The consulted sources asserted that CADISA's operations in 
Uruguay favor the strategy of Citibank, which currently has a 
dispute with the AEBU because it refuses to acknowledge the 
enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement valid for the 
entire industry. Citibank, on one hand, is trying to weaken the 
union and, on the other, to become the leader of the banks that 
belong to the Association of Banking Enterprises, which it left 
a few months ago. 
  CADISA operations are regarded as "unfair competition" by 
Citibank regarding the rest of the banking institutions. 
Citibank channels its financial intermediary activities through 
CADISA, which has significantly reduced costs. The case is 
quite unique: Citicarteras has no employees; its agents appear 
as a one-man enterprise. Nor do they collect salaries because 
they earn commissions and percentages that eliminate, among 
other things, the payment of contributions to the BPS [Social 
Security Bank]. 
  Labor union sources stated, however, that Citicarteras' 
financial intermediary operations imply a risk not mentioned in 
its advertisements: The corporation is not covered by bank 
secrecy and any judge, as well as the General Directorate of 
Taxation, can intervene the bank accounts. That is, as long as 
there is a desire to control what seems a profitable and almost 
perfect mechanism for money laundering.

  Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang, addressing a 
convention 
to inaugurate the Chinese Society for the Prevention and 
Treatment of Drug Abuse, stressed that we must learn from 
countries around the world about their successes in combating 
drugs and hoped that the society will launch mass prevention and 
treatment. The convention was told that the majority of the 
country's 250,000 drug addicts are concentrated mainly in 
Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Guangxi Provinces.

<H5>  Guangxi </H5>
  Five prefectures and cities in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region, namely, Nanning, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Yulin, and Bose, held 
trials on cases of major drug offenses. In accordance with the 
death warrants verified and issued by the Supreme People's 
Court, 13 drug criminals were executed according to law. These 
13 criminals had trafficked in and transported a total of 13.5 
kg of heroin and 28.6 kg of opium. Drug crimes have shown an 
upward curve in Guangxi in recent years with a significant 
increase in big drug cases and increasingly refined narcotic 
products. From 1991 through October 1993, courts at various 
levels in the region processed 367 drug cases in various 
categories and passed sentence on 843 drug criminals, 
effectively deterring drug crime. (Summary) (Beijing XINHUA

  [Text] Guangzhou, 27 Dec (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- 
Policemen from the Enping County Public Security Bureau of 
Guangdong Province arrested two drug traffickers and seized 32 
kg of heroin on 22 December. In addition, eight other suspects 
of the same case were also arrested. 
  The two culprits, surnamed Gong and Tang, often carrying 
guns 
with them, have been engaging in drug trafficking from Burma to 
mainland China for a long time. The case was tracked down and 
solved by the Enping County Public Security Bureau, which took 
as a clue the rumor among the drug addicts in the county that 
the "rice" (meaning drugs) there was both cheap and fine. 
  Further investigations are now under way for this case.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Burmese Troops Are Crushing Khun Sa"] </F>
  [Text] The Burmese Government has sent its ground and air 
forces to mop up the ethnic minority troops under the command of 
Khun Sa. Heavy clashes have been reported since December inside 
of Burma, opposite the Thai border at Chiang Mai and Mae Hong 
Son. 
  The sound of gunfire was not heard over the new year 
holiday. 
The Burmese Government, however, has reportedly sent more troops 
to crush the international drug kingpin's army and cut off the 
huge income he earns each year from his opium crops and the 
export of heroin. 
  About 20 heroin refineries are believed to exist in that 
part 
of the Golden Triangle in Burma that is under the control of 
Khun Sa, who is said to command an army of over 6,000 troops. 
If the Burmese junta cannot stop Khun Sa's expansion, the world 
faces a bigger danger from drug addiction. 
  The world looks upon Thailand as a transit route for opium 
and heroin smuggled out of the Golden Triangle for distribution 
worldwide. Thailand has never been able to stop the flow of 
drugs completely, no matter how tough its prevention and 
suppression measures are. 
  The vice chairman of China's Narcotics Suppression 
Commission 
once said that, only a few years after the country opened up in 
1976, it began to encounter several problems related to 
narcotics--especially heroin--flowing out of the Golden Triangle 
and the Economic Quadrangle to its north. 
  China seized 900 kg of heroin in 1991, but in 1992 it seized 
a total of 4,200 kg of heroin. Most of the arrests were made in 
Yunnan. Heroin is therefore one of the most worrisome problems 
China now faces. 
  It can be assumed that without effective measures by both 
Thailand and China to stop production at its source--and halt 
the flow of narcotics from the Golden Triangle and the Economic 
Quadrangle in Burma before they reach international 
markets--narcotic drugs will surely continue to flood world 
markets. 
  We cannot rely entirely on the capabilities of the Burmese 
soldiers to suppress Khun Sa's army and provide the only hope 
for preventing people around the world from becoming slaves to 
drug addiction. It is the duty of Burma's neighbors--Thailand, 
Laos, and China--to cooperate closely in their efforts and 
seriously prevent and suppress the trafficking of all types of 
narcotic drugs.

  [Text] The Philippine National Police Narcotics Command 
[Narcom] leads the list of government personnel implicated in 
drug trafficking. This was revealed in a letter to Defense 
Secretary Renato De Villa by General Lisandro Abadia, chief of 
staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines [AFP]. 
  According to Abadia, some officials and personnel of Narcom 
are able to sell illegal drugs that have been confiscated. 
Narcom operatives are allegedly giving protection to drug 
pushers in exchange for big pay-offs or bribes. 
  In light of this, Abadia has proposed a system to safeguard 
confiscated drugs and to reveal law enforcers involved in drug 
pushing. 
  Meanwhile, Abadia's accusations were immediately denied by 
Narcom Chief Ramsey Ocampo. Ocampo admitted that some Narcom 
personnel may be involved in drug pushing, but, it does not mean 
that the whole command is involved in drug trafficking. 
  [Begin Ocampo recording in progress] ...unscrupulous 
activities of some of our personnel. The complexities mentioned 
by Gen. Abadia are based on previous perceptions. [sentence as 
heard] As a matter of fact, their claims of service from the 
admissions of small-time drug pushers that were arrested before, 
well, it is normal that the arrested drug pushers will accuse 
Narcom operatives of involvement in irregularities. So far, we 
have not handled a case where there has been no counter-charge 
against us.

  [Text] Thai and Nigerian police have smashed a major heroin 
trafficking syndicate, arresting several people last month and 
seizing more than 400 kilos of the drug in both countries. 
  Thai Narcotics Suppression Bureau chief Kowit Phuphanit said 
yesterday Nigerian police had seized 259 kilos of heroin after a 
tipoff by Thai officials. 
  The heroin was seized on December 30 in a joint effort by 
Thai, Nigerian and British police as well as the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA), he said. 
  In four separate swoops in Bangkok in December, Thai 
officials found 166.65 kilos of heroin and arrested six 
Nigerians and one Thai woman, he said. 
  A Nigerian drug dealer, Joe Brown believed to be the boss of 
a drug smuggling ring, was arrested in Nigeria on December 17, 
Kowit said. 
  The December 30 raid in Nigeria followed the discovery by 
Thai police that heroin had been shipped from Bangkok to Lagos. 
Thai police got the information after they raided an apartment 
rented by a Nigerian in the Pratunam area on December 7. Seven 
kilos of heroin were found in the raid. 
  The December 7 operation also led to the arrest a week later 
of two Nigerians, the seizure of another 37 kilos of heroin and 
the discovery that a man identified as Joe Brown was a key 
figure in the ring. 
  Thai police subsequently contacted the Nigerian authorities 
who later arrested the man. Another Nigerian was arrested in 
Thailand on December 22 with 25 kilos of heroin hidden in a 
water cooler to be sent to Lagos. 
  Two days later three more suspects were arrested with 97 
kilos of heroin also hidden in water coolers.

  [Text] Thailand has been cooperating with the United 
States, Britain, and Nigeria in suppressing drug trafficking in 
Nigeria leading to seizure of 425 kilograms of heroin. 
  Commissioner of the Narcotics Suppression Bureau attached to 
the Police Department Police Lieutenant General Kowit Phakdiphum 
said many Thai Government officers have jointly worked with 
their counterparts in those countries. They include the 
Narcotics Suppression Bureau, the Central Investigation Bureau, 
the Customs Department, and the Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board working in cooperation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration, the British Customs Agency, Nigerian authorities 
in cracking down on international drug smuggling rings. 
  Investigation shows that Nigerian drug traffickers come to 
Thailand to smuggle a container of heroin from a port in 
Thailand to the Nigerian capital of Lagos via Singapore. On 
December 31, 1993, the Nigerian authorities seized the container 
of 259 kilograms of heroin in Lagos. The 166 kilograms of 
heroin seized earlier in Thailand from the accused Nigerian had 
been sent to the Nigerian authorities. In this mission, the 
total of 425 kilograms of heroin was seized from the accused 
Nigerian. There was no Thai involved. 
  The commissioner of the Naroctics Suppression Bureau said 
the 
mission has achieved its aim of breaking down an important drug 
racket.

  [Text] In a bid to curb money laundering in Thailand, 
Washington has pressed Bangkok to introduce a law forcing money 
spenders and depositors to declare the source of funds. 
  A Finance Ministry source said that US Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen is expected to repeat the call at his meeting with 
Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin on January 19. The topic 
will be on the agenda, which includes a double taxation 
avoidance treaty, the bilateral Treaty of Amity, and the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
  Last year, U.S. officials urged their Thai counterparts to 
introduce a law to prevent money laundering, following bilateral 
talks on how to curb the narcotics trade. At that time, 
Thailand informed the U.S. that it would consider the matter. 
  The source, however, noted that the Thai government is 
unlikely to introduce such a law as it would burden local 
financial institutions. Another source noted that it might be 
difficult for the government to even pass the required bill in 
the current political situation. 
  Moreover, Thailand currently has some laws related to money 
laundering practices. The first source added that the 
introduction of a new law might run counter to the country's 
plan to move towards financial liberalization since it would 
lead to restrictive regulations on the remittance of money. 
  At any rate, the Finance Ministry has set up a working 
committee to study the pros and cons of such a law and whether 
it's timely for the country to introduce a bill. Recently, 
Finance Ministry officials also flew to Singapore to discuss 
procedures in that country's money-laundering act. 
  Singapore is the only ASEAN country which has a 
money-laundering act because, being a free-port nation, the 
industrialized island sees a need for tight control of money 
remittances. 
  The source said that Secretary Bentsen is likely to urge 
Thailand to introduce a bill by citing the healthy growth of the 
economy, Bangkok's current financial liberalization and its 
ambition to become a regional financial centre.

<F P=106> [By Regina Jere] </F>
  [Text] Lusaka, Jan 4 (AFP) -- Zambian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Vernon Mwaanga announced his resignation Tuesday 
following a barrage of press and public accusations linking him 
to drug trafficking. 
  Mwaanga's resignation also comes in the wake of 
international 
concern over corruption and drug dealing in the Zambian 
Government expressed by donors at a consultative group meeting 
in Paris last month. 
  "I want to inform the nation of my solemn decision to stand 
down as minister of foreign affairs with immediate effect," 
Mwaanga told a packed press conference at his office, adding 
that his decision was as a result of a relentless campaign 
fueled by "people and entities with limitless malice." 
  "I am not involved in drug trafficking and I am not involved 
in corrupt practices or abuse of public office...but it is my 
duty to see to it that government position is not compromised," 
he said. 
  The minister said his decision to step down was aimed at 
giving the government a free hand to investigate fully and 
thouroughly the allegations leveled against him. "It is my 
perception that the government should have unfettered ability to 
investigate allegations of drug trafficking, corruption and 
misuse of public funds by public officers at whatever levels," 
Mwaanga said. 
  He became the fourth cabinet minister to voluntarily leave 
the two-year-old government of President Frederick Chiluba. 
  Since ushering in his cabinet after the 1991 multi-party 
elections, Chiluba has been under persistent pressure to act on 
alleged high level corruption and drug trafficking in his 
government. 
  Local press reports and opposition figures have alleged that 
there are a number of ministers involved in the vice and accused 
Chiluba of failing to take action because they bankrolled his 
1991 presidential campaign. 
  Mwaanga, Community Development Minister Nakatindi Wina and 
her husband Sikota, who is deputy speaker of the National 
Assembly, were detained for months by former president Kenneth 
Kaunda for their alleged involvement in mandrax drug trafficking 
in 1985. The findings of a special tribunal appointed by Kaunda 
to investigate them have not been made public. 
  Finance Minister Ronald Penza told journalists after the 
Paris meeting that donors had withheld 96 million dollars of the 
required financial assistance of almost a billion dollars 
because of their concern about drug trafficking and corruption 
in the Zambian Government. He said the donors described Zambia 
as "the Colombia of Africa" and he called on Chiluba to take 
action before the next consultative group meeting in March. 
  Deputy Minister for Economic Planning Dean Mungomba, who 
accompanied Penza to Paris, has echoed the finance minister's 
views. "Our relations with our cooperating partners will be 
strained if serious steps are not taken before March.... We 
have dealt with serious problems like inflation and monetary 
control, I do not see why drug trafficking cannot be dealt 
with," Mungomba said. 
  Mwaanga said, however, that he will remain a committed 
member 
of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) although 
"the campaign against me has been orchestrated by colleagues in 
government who are themselves the very epitome of greed, who 
from their first day in government have used every opportunity 
to sustain their appetite for material possessions." He 
appealed to the other ministers accused of drug dealing to 
follow his example.

  [Text] Sofia, December 30 (BTA) -- The Ministry of the 
Interior tonight denied a story in the TEMPO magazine of Ankara, 
alleging that members of a Kurdish terrorist organization were 
based in Bulgaria. 
  "The Ministries of Bulgaria and Turkey have signed a 
cooperation agreement and exchange information on the combating 
of terrorism," says a press release of the Interior Ministry 
received at BTA. It stresses that Bulgaria's special services 
have no information on the existence of such an organization in 
this country and have not exchanged information on the matter 
with Turkey. "What the magazine says about there being a link 
between a Kurdish terrorist organization and Iranian drug 
traffickers could be described only as a journalist's 
interpretation unsupported by facts and evidence," the press 
release also says. The story in TEMPO, commented in most big 
Bulgarian dailies today, says the Bulgarian special services 
have found out that PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members 
have penetrated into Bulgaria after some West European countries 
outlawed them. The story alleges that the PKK was connected 
with one Iraqi and two Iranian drug runners, discovered in a 
recent police check in a Sofia flat, in which one policeman was 
killed. Indeed one police officer was killed on December 6, and 
another died from his wounds in hospital later on, but the 
Bulgarian police reported they had been shot by Iranian drug 
traffickers, shot dead by the police as they resisted arrest. 
  The Interior Ministry also stated it had no information on 
the existence of a Bulgarian-Greek ring which, according to 
ELLADHA SIMERA of Greece, illegally transfers foreign currency. 
Allegedly, it operates through gambling casinos in Bulgaria and 
is connected with senior government officials. "The Interior 
Ministries of Bulgaria and Greece have signed an agreement which 
includes exchange of operative information, so far, however, 
there has been neither information nor inquiries about the 
activities of such a group," says the ministry's press release.

"Drug Users Are Caught Every Month"] 
  [Text] All kinds of drugs including hemp, LSD, and cocaine 
are now available in Budapest. The buying and selling usually 
takes place in night clubs open to young people. The sides 
usually firmly conspire but the business is almost completely 
open in some places. 
  Prices naturally vary from product to product. A marijuana 
cigarette can already be bought for 200 forints, approximately 
one gram of amphetamine ("speed") costs 5,000 forints, a gram of 
LSD is between 600 and 1,000 forints, and heroin addicts can get 
their daily dosage for as little as 500 forints. Cocaine is the 
most expensive drug, one dose is between 12,000 and 13,000 
forints at the moment. 
  Major Bela Harman, head of the Budapest Police Headquarters 
[BRFK] Youth Protection Section, said that, since it is against 
the law, there are not any records on drug users in Budapest. 
However, it is certain that the drug users are almost all young 
people. Officers of his section have been visiting the infamous 
entertainment places of the inner districts for two years and, 
as we learned from Lieutenant Zoltan Kurucz, a permanent member 
of the force, a drug user group is discovered almost every 
month. The BRFK's biggest catch this year was 15 kilograms of 
marijuana and a 30-piece LSD stamp collection, and one month 
ago, a whole Mexican wild hemp plantation was found in 
Budakalasz. The lines from the latest drug case in Budapest led 
the youth protection officers from a well known notorious club 
to the Ujpalota blocks of flats. The procedure has been going 
on for a little more than two weeks now. During the 
investigation, the police confiscated almost 400 grams of hemp 
derivatives. 
  According to estimates, some 20 tons of drugs crossed the 
country in 1993, and some 200 kilograms of this was confiscated 
by the Hungarian police. According to a youth protection 
officer of one of the foundations, we still cannot talk about a 
drug mafia in Hungary. In Sandor Farago's view, it might still 
be possible to achieve with adequate means--and a much broader 
preventive work--that Hungary is preserved as a relatively calm 
island in the center of Europe.

<F P=106> [Attila Gy. Fekete report: "Seven Hundred Kilograms of </F>
Drugs Last Year--The Drug Seizures of the Police and the Customs 
Guard in 1993"] 
  [Text] Last year, the Customs and Excise Office and the 
police together confiscated 697 kgs and 108 grams of drugs, we 
learned from officials of the two bodies. Significant amounts 
of drugs, namely more than 20 grams, were caught on 35 occasions 
at the border and 27 times inside the country. The police found 
less than 20 grams of drugs on dealers and consumers on 45 
occasions. 
  The police and the Customs Office together confiscated on 62 
occasions 427 kgs of heroin, 253 kgs of hashish (a quarter of a 
ton of this was found in a truck in one consignment), 10 kgs of 
marijuana, and 3 kgs of cocaine. Officers of the Customs and 
Excise Office confiscated a significant amount of drugs on 35 
occasions, significant amount meaning drugs equivalent to 20 
grams of heroin. Drugs were found in railway carriages 13 times, 
six times in trucks, seven times in cars, four times in hiding 
places in buses, and five times in airports hidden in various 
parcels. 
  The 200 kgs of heroin found in a truck at Nagylak in 
December 
was the biggest catch of the Customs and Excise Office. They 
wanted to carry out a detailed check on the truck when the 
driver jumped out of his cabin and escaped; he still has not 
been found. 
  According to officials of the Customs and Excise Office 
national headquarters, in 1993, customs officers learned how to 
recognize the documents of trucks that are very likely to be 
carrying drugs. It is a telltale sign if the driver comes from 
a drug-growing area, or if the consignment was sent from such an 
area. It is also suspicious if the truck is progressing too 
slowly through the Balkans toward Hungary. 
  One-third of all the confiscated drugs were found by the 
customs officers on the basis of police information, police 
experts claim. However, the customs officers say that they would 
be able to discover much more drugs if their work was assisted 
by modern screening equipment. From U.S. aid, Bulgarian customs 
officers started to use such equipment at their Turkish border, 
and their efficiency has multiplied since then. 
  The police caught significant amounts of drugs inside the 
country on 27 occasions--20 times in Budapest--in 1993. They 
confiscated amounts smaller than 20 grams on 45 occasions, from 
drug dealers and consumers, and from burglars of pharmacies who 
stole narcotic materials. Altogether 119 drug smugglers and 
dealers were arrested in connection with 72 cases. 
  On the first day of 1994 at Lokoshaza, 3.9 kgs of heroin was 
found in the double-based suitcase of a German woman who was 
traveling from Turkey to Germany on the Ovidius international 
express.

<F P=106> [Article by Alain Lallemand: "Turkish Extreme Right, </F>
Ankara's Objective Ally"] 
  [Text] Who are these "Gray Wolves" in Belgium which 
Interior Minister Louis Tobback is accusing of leading the 
anti-Kurd demonstrations of recent days? 
  Their official name is "Turk-islam Federasyonu" or "Belcika 
Turk-islam Kultur Dernekleri Federasyonu," which can be 
translated as "Turkish-Islamic Federation" or "Federation of 
Turkish-Islamic Cultural Associations of Belgium." The Belgian 
headquarters of this federation is in Beringen, and its European 
headquarters are in Frankfurt. It is also supported actively at 
international level by the Turkish Government, which denies 
this, as might be expected. 
  As an extremely dangerous extreme right movement, it is an 
avatar of Colonel Alparslan Turkes' fascist nationalist party. 
Highly active in the late 1970's and 1980's, its members 
specialized in guerilla warfare and the murder of progressive 
politicians. They also engaged in heroin trafficking in order 
to finance their activities. 
  However, they are even better known for their direct 
involvement in the failed attempt against Pope John-Paul II in 
May 1981. If we are to believe the Turkish daily, MILLIYET, the 
person who fired the shots in Saint Peter's square in Rome, Ali 
Agca, was allegedly harbored for a while with the Belgian 
representative of the "Gray Wolves," Selahattin Saygin, in 
Maasmechelen. 
  Do the "Gray Wolves" also benefit in Belgium from the 
relative leniency of the Turkish authorities? Of course: In 
1986, during the third conference of "Gray Wolves" of Belgium, 
the fundamentalist Turkish newspaper, DUSUNCE, reported that 
apart from Selahattin Saygin, the Turkish consul from Antwerp, 
Feyha Enc, and the Turkish minister of health, Halil Sivgin, 
also appeared at the podium. 
  Belgium is also used by the "Gray Wolves" for heroin 
trafficking. This information has already been published several 
times in LE SOIR, but it should again be pointed out that one of 
the "Gray Wolves'" most famous activists, Oral Celik, alias 
Bedri Ates (borrowed name), was arrested on 10 November 1986 in 
Halluin by the French customs authorities, while leaving our 
country with 3.6 kg of heroin. Concealed under a false 
identity, he has since admitted that he was indeed the extreme 
right activist fingered by his fellow terrorist, Ali Agca. 
  Further evidence of the criminal activity of the "Gray 
Wolves" in Belgium was the presence in September 1990 in the 
Liege suburbs of Ahmet Esensoy, who was involved in heroin 
trafficking and was the right-hand man of Rifat Yildirim, one of 
the most famous "Gray Wolves" terrorists. Esensoy, who has 
since been apprehended, was in transit. A generally reliable 
source says that there are allegedly comings and goings between 
Belgium and the Frankfurt "city bazaar," the preferred spot of 
the "Gray Wolves."

<F P=106> [Article by Susanna Reinboth: "Sentences for Men </F>
Manufacturing Amphetamines Reduced by Appeals Court"] 
  [Text] The Helsinki Court of Appeals has reduced the 
sentences imposed on the operators of an Espoo amphetamines 
laboratory by several months. 
  An amateur chemist who had manufactured amphetamines 
received 
a sentence of three years and eight months. The Espoo District 
Court had sentenced him in June to four years in prison. 
  According to the court, the chemist had made a total of just 
under 2 kg of amphetamines. Over a kilogram of the drugs ended 
up being sold, but the chemist did not know how to distribute 
them. 
  The sentences of the chemist's partners in crime were also 
slightly reduced. Two of the men received prison sentences of 
four years and eight months and the third man got four years and 
three months. The sentences meted out by the district court had 
been several months longer. 
  During the trial the chemist claimed that he had 
manufactured 
the amphetamines in cooperation with the police. According to 
the chemist, the police's plan was to catch the men who ran the 
drug ring. 
  Because of his claims, the police who were examined in 
connection with the chemist were suspected of being guilty. They 
were suspected of incitement to commit drug crimes and of breach 
of duty. After the preliminary investigation, Provincial 
Prosecutor Lasse Apio decided that there was not enough proof to 
bring charges against them.

<F P=106> [Article by Katri Peltola: "Feelings Heat Up in the </F>
Parliamentary Debate on Drugs"] 
  [Text] The opposition would have preferred lighter 
penalties for drug use than at present. During the plenary 
session on Friday [19 November] 173 members of the Eduskunta 
absented themselves from the vote. 
  The Eduskunta wants to retain drug use as a punishable act, 
but a heated debate was engaged in during the plenary session on 
Friday on the penalties prescribed by law. During the return 
debate two bills were proposed, through which drug violations 
would be transferred to the penal code. 
  The government essentially wants to preserve the present 
penalties. Some members of the opposition would be willing to 
lighten the maximum penalties prescribed by law because they are 
simply not applied under current practice. 
  The members of the the Parliamentary Laws Committee engaged 
in such a thorough debate on drugs that the other members of the 
Eduskunta managed to beat a hasty retreat to their home grounds. 
Fully 173 of the 200 members of the Eduskunta were absent from 
the last vote of the plenary session at 1635 hours. 
  The vote related to the question as to whether the disputed 
agriculture fund should be taken up for preliminary debate on 
Monday or Tuesday. Some members of the Eduskunta would have 
preferred to postpone debate on the issue until Tuesday so that 
they would have time to obtain even more information on the 
matter. However, the Speaker's Council proposal that it be 
debated on Monday won out by a vote of 14 to 12. 
  The government is proposing that the illegal manufacture, 
importing, exporting, transporting, distribution, possession, 
and use of drugs be written into the revised penal code. 
  At the same time the minimum penalty for a drug felony would 
increased to one year in prison. 
<H5>  Origin of Illegal Money Must Be Reported </H5>
  So-called money laundering would become a crime. Among other 
things, banks would be obligated to report to government 
officials if they suspect that a client is trying to conceal the 
origin of money obtained illegally. 
  Justice Minister Hannele Pokka (Center Party) maintained 
during the debate that the kind of maximum penalty for drug use 
that is to be written into law is not a matter of indifference. 
In her opinion, former Justice Minister Tarja Halonen's (Social 
Democrat) "approach" to lowering the maximum penalty would be a 
clear message to international criminals, among others. She was 
supported by Conservative Kari Hakamies. "I am not willing to 
accept the proposition that a faulty sentencing practice is a 
good one," Halonen contended. 
  In agreement with Halonen's position was the Greens' Satu 
Hassi, according to whom Pokka "is feigning ignorance" of the 
fact that the intent, in connection with revision of the penal 
code, is to write into law those penalties that are actually 
applied. According to Hassi, there are no differences of opinion 
on that point. On the other hand, according to him, there should 
be a sharper distinction between penalties for using and selling 
drugs. 
  During the debate concern was also raised over whether drug 
users know that they can seek treatment without fear of being 
caught. 
  Vesa Laukkanen, representing the Alternative for Finland 
group, thought that the threat of punishment influences those 
who are not using drugs. Users, however, can, of course, seek 
treatment if they want to. 
  The government was also encouraged by the Eduskunta to look 
into how a stage of treatment could be included in sentences. 
  Members of the Eduskunta representing the government parties 
and the opposition were united in their concern over the 
widespread use of drugs in prisons. [passage omitted]

It is no longer diluted with other substances so often."

  [Text] The Customs Department scored two big successes 
today in combating the international network of narcotics 
trafficking. At Kipoi, Evros, a car belonging to German 
citizens who entered from Turkey was inspected, and small 
packages of heroin totaling 37 kg were found and confiscated. 
  In Khania, customs officials found and confiscated 442 kg of 
Indian cannabis after searching a British yacht coming from 
Yemen.

<F P=106> [Report by Khania correspondent Dhimitrios Dhaskalakis] </F>
  [Text] By noon today approximately four tons of 
top-quality hashish had been taken from the hold and other 
hiding places of the yacht Gypsy Falcon, sailing under the 
British flag. The officials of Khania Customs Department 
believe that shocking things will be found as the ghost yacht is 
inspected completely. 
  The hashish, which was very carefully packed in 1-kg and 
2-kg 
cakes as well as in the form of tiles, was being taken by stages 
this morning by small trucks to safe storage at the Customs 
Department. 
  (Marco Ribic), 50, of Dubrovnik, who was the captain of the 
yacht and engineer (Denis Vitmar), 39, of Zagreb in the former 
Yugoslavia, who were the only two persons aboard the yacht, have 
been arrested and will probably be arraigned before the Khania 
prosecutor tomorrow. 
  According to reports, the yacht sailed from Yemen and 
through 
the Suez Canal was heading for Slovenia. However, because of 
engine trouble, it sailed into Khania port three days ago.

  [Text] Customs officials at Kipoi border checkpoint in 
Evros have captured the leader of a ring which tried to come 
through carrying 19 kg of heroin. Correspondent Yeoryios 
Feretis has the details. 
  [Feretis] For some time now the biggest heroin trafficker 
from Pakistan (Fahd Salahuddin), 30, was wondering why all his 
associates get stopped at the customs checkpoint at Kipoi, 
Evros, and cannot get the heroin to European countries. 
Therefore, he attempted to transport the heroin himself. He 
took a luxurious Mercedes that he recently bought from a U.S. 
senator, and at about 2300 he arrived at the Kipoi checkpoint. 
Customs officials welcomed him and when he said that he was in 
a hurry and wanted to go through the control quickly, the 
customs officials sent the car to the search ramp. The whole 
truth was discovered there. Within minutes, the customs 
officials discovered 19 kg of heroin in the sides of the car. 
  [Unidentified police official] This case is particularly 
interesting. This is a businessman, not a carrier. He is an 
experienced businessman who knows what he is doing; he has large 
economic interests, international connections and has traveled 
the whole world.

  [Text] Naples, Italy, Jan 1 (AFP) -- Police seized more 
than 12 kilogrammes (26 pounds) of heroin worth in excess of 
eight million dollars Sunday after a car chase through Naples. 
  The drugs were seized from an Audi car with Swiss number 
plates after the vehicle was forced to stop at a police 
roadblock in the southern Italian city, local police said. 
  Police said they found the heroin, which was valued at 8.2 
million dollars, in a plastic bag hidden underneath one of the 
rear seats. 
  The chase began after the car failed to stop at a routine 
police checkpoint at an exit off the city's ring road. 
  The driver of the Audi was arrested. Police identified him 
as Istref Salih, 44, adding that they believed him to be a Turk 
and a member of an international drug network based in South 
America. 
  Salih was carrying a passport of a central European country 
at the time of his arrest, police added.

  [Text] Announcer: In Sardinia there is a red 
alert as far as drugs are concerned, particularly in Cagliari, 
where a deadly form of Thai heroin is circulating. Tonino Opes 
reports. 
  Opes: Four victims in two days: Drugs are 
exacting a heavy toll in Sardinia. There are lethal overdoses 
from the killer heroin that has recently begun to arrive from 
Thailand after an absence of ten years. Now it has replaced 
Brown Sugar [previous two words in English] and its effects are 
more devastating. The Cagliari police commissioner, Emilio 
Pazzi, has sounded the alarm. 
  Pazzi: To inject oneself with a dose of Thai 
heroin for those who are used to Brown Sugar, using most 
probably the same dose, means facing almost certain death. 
  Opes: Thai heroin is exceptionally pure and is 
difficult to cut into doses, so drug addicts are running a high 
risk. In Cagliari alone there are over 10,000 drug addicts, but 
the problem concerns the whole island. Unfortunately Sardinia 
has one of the highest rates of AIDS in Italy. 
  Announcer: We have just received the news that the 
killer-heroin has claimed another victim this morning in Sassari 
[Sardinia]. A young man of 32 died after having injected 
himself with a dose of the lethal heroin.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Martin Bjorklid: "Fewer Overdose Deaths in </F>
Oslo"] 
  [Text] The number of deaths caused by drug abuse has 
decreased sharply in Oslo this year. In Drammen on the other 
hand, the number of such deaths has doubled. 
  So far this year 42 people have been found dead in Oslo from 
overdoses. During all of last year 76 such deaths were recorded. 
There is no clear explanation of this development. The head of 
the overdose team in Oslo, Rolf-Dieter Cron, thinks that the 
increase in drug interdiction during the past year has played no 
part in this positive development. 
<H5>  Fewer Emergencies </H5>
  The police are also hesitant to draw any solid conclusions 
about what impact large drug confiscations have had on the 
availability in the illegal market. 
  The overdose team has had fewer emergency calls than in the 
previous two years. At the same time one has had to give 
antidotes to several people to save their life. Last year about 
60 percent of those who had taken an overdose were given an 
antidote, and this year this has risen to almost 80 percent. 
  "Of the 42 deaths recorded this year we see a trend that 
many 
of these do not belong to the typical inner-city environment. 
Many of these have been visitors. I am now anxious to see if the 
decline in the number of deaths will also take place in other 
large cities like Copenhagen, Bremen, and Stockholm," Cron says. 
  He thinks that if there is no decline in the other cities, 
the overdose team's efforts are an important reason for the 
decline in Oslo. He thinks that the increase in confiscated 
sedatives will also have an impact. Police this year have 
confiscated 30,000 pills compared to about 10,000 last year. 
<H5>  Dramatic in Drammen </H5>
  "We know that the mixture of heroin and sedatives is a 
life-threatening combination. When it is more difficult to 
obtain pills, this situation will have an effect on the number 
of overdoses," Cron says. 
  Drammen has had a tremendous increase in the number of drug 
deaths this past year. So far 21 deaths have been recorded. In 
all of last year the city had 13 such cases. The cities of 
Stavanger and Bergen have also had a higher number of overdoses 
and deaths. Because of the increases there the number of deaths 
in the entire country will probably not decrease this year 
compared to last year. Then a total of 97 deaths were recorded. 
  Police Lieutenant Kristian Sather at Drammen police station 
is quite worried over this development. 
  "It is increasingly younger people who are being recruited 
into the drug scene. Drammen is a burdened city, and we have 
much to fight against." He points out the fact that the police 
alone cannot prevent people from being drawn into the drug scene. 
  "The ambulance service in Drammen has done a great job and 
saved many lives," Sather says.

<F P=106> [Interview with Raymond Kendall, Interpol Secretary General </F>
since 1985 by Vincent Jauvert; place and date not given: 
"Drugs--The Confession of Interpol Chief"] 
  [Text] Jauvert: You are very pessimistic at 
present... 
  Kendall: Yes, the situation has deteriorated 
enormously. In the early 1970's, when I headed the Interpol's 
narcotics division, there was no real drug problem in Europe: 
Trafficking was essentially directed toward the United States. 
What is the situation now at the beginning of 1994? In Paris, 
London, Frankfurt or Rome, in all the great European cities, the 
drug market is booming, with an ever increasing number of drug 
addicts. This is why I am sounding the alarm, making an appeal 
to politicians, and saying: Beware, if we continue fighting 
against drug abuse in the way we have for the past 20 years, we 
will definitely lose the battle--perhaps we have already lost 
it, for that matter... 
  Jauvert: Can you suggest any solutions? 
  Kendall: There is only one possible solution: 
Doing everything in our power to reduce consumption. Our 
rulers must finally acknowledge this: Whatever efforts the 
law-enforcement agencies make, drug producers and dealers will 
continue to thrive as long as there are millions of consumers in 
our countries. The only way of breaking the market, is to make 
demand drop dramatically. 
  Jauvert: What about hitting the producing 
countries even harder? 
  Kendall: You can try to, of course... Recently, a 
French politician even said that they should be attacked 
militarily, if necessary... 
  Jauvert: It was Charles Pasqua [interior 
minister], am I right? 
  Kendall: You are saying so. 
  Jauvert: Was it not a good idea? 
  Kendall: Let us be realistic. Let us take, for 
example, the case of the Medellin cartel's boss Pablo Escobar. 
Will the fact that he was eliminated change anything at all? 
No, it may perhaps have a psychological effect on other drug 
dealers but, as to the rest, we know for some considerable time 
that his cartel has been replaced by that of Cali. In other 
words, the economic and social conditions in the producing 
countries are such that it is nonsense to believe that people 
there are going to deprive themselves of the financial benefits 
derived from producing coca, opium, or cannabis. Of course, we 
must try to convince them, one way or the other. But we should 
not expect significant results in the short or even in the long 
term on that front. 
  Jauvert: What if we help those countries convert 
their production to coffee, wheat, rice... 
  Kendall: We must do so, obviously. But, there 
again, let us be realistic and look at the results. In 
Thailand, for example, a conversion policy has now been 
implemeted for over 15 years, but this did not prevent a heroin 
production boom from taking place in the Golden Triangle. No, 
that is not how the problem will be solved. 
  Jauvert: Nor do you believe it will take us any 
further to concentrate our efforts on the drug trade itself and, 
therefore, on repressive measures. 
  Kendall: No. Every year we are seizing greater 
and greater quantities of drugs and arresting an ever increasing 
number of dealers. However, at the same time, the amount of 
narcotics available in our countries is increasing. Therefore, 
let us continue by all means to crack down on dealers but, there 
again, let us not hope for miracles. 
  Jauvert: Not even if the means of repression were 
considerably increased? 
  Kendall: Let us imagine that we double the 
financial resources available for the narcotics brigades. Will 
we thereby multiply by two the seizures? I do not think so. We 
will get to know the problem better, we will develop what is 
today called "criminal intelligence," that is to say, 
information techniques on organized crime. This is important, 
but how can it improve the root problem, namely consumption? A 
few years ago, the Americans tried to determine the ratio 
between seizures and the amount of actually available drug. 
Well then, according to this study, in certain countries the 
ratio is as low as 5 percent, and the maximum is 25 percent. 
Now, researchers have estimated that it would be necessary to 
seize 40 percent or even 50 percent, according to a recent 
investigation, in order to have a real impact on the market, 
that is, in order to reduce consumption. We are very far from 
these figures. The traffickers' stocks are gigantic. In other 
words, even by increasing the repressive means considerably, we 
would not achieve a significant impact on drug addiction. 
  Jauvert: It might also be possible to intensify 
the fight against the laundering of narco-dollars, which has 
become very topical over the past few months. 
  Kendall: It must be done, of course. But I am 
afraid that this new hobby-horse may lead us to lose sight of 
the real problem. Combating the laundering of money is not an 
end in itself, it is only a means for stopping drug dealers, and 
one which is not--let us be frank about it--particularly 
effective. Let us take, for example, the BCCI affair, the 
greatest laundering operation ever to be discovered. What did 
it come to? After 4 years' work, after mobilizing a huge number 
of police, only 3 people have been prosecuted for laundering 14 
million dollars. Now, the annual turnover for drug dealing is 
estimated at 350 billion dollars, about 100 of which would 
appear to be invested in the international financial circuit. 
Fourteen million out of 350 billion: This is little more than 
a drop of water in the sea! 
  Jauvert: Since then, special brigades have been 
set up to combat money-laundering. 
  Kendall: So much the better. But what resources 
do they have at their disposal? In France, for example, the 
team comprises some twenty people. Ask them how many cases they 
are able to crack in a year. You will be surprised at the 
ridiculously small figure they will quote. You will object that 
their personnel could be increased. This would of course be 
positive, but it would not change the root problem in the least. 
There is, in our countries, considerable demand for narcotics, 
and as long as this is the case--you can rest assured--people 
will continue to produce drugs, deal in them, and will continue 
to launder money. 
  Jauvert: In your view, then, this demand can be 
reduced? 
  Kendall: In any case, we should try to. Until 
now, there have been few efforts in this direction. Politicians 
speak of "war" on drug addiction, and they are right because the 
future of our democracies is at stake. Nevertheless, let us 
compare the defense budget to that available for special centers 
for drug addicts. Do the resources available, say in France or 
Britain, exceed the price of a single fighter plane? If this 
were so, I would be very surprised to learn it. The Swedes, 
however, have shown that, when a genuine political will is 
there, demand can be curtailed. For some years now, they have 
been spending considerable sums of money in information 
campaigns and aid programs aimed at drug addicts. As a result, 
consumption has dropped dramatically. I am not saying that the 
Swedish model can be transplanted anywhere, but it should be 
studied more closely. 
  Jauvert: Why are Western governments, in your 
opinion, being so inactive? 
  Kendall: I have often asked myself that question, 
and I have found 3 reasons. In the first place, developing an 
effective prevention and help program for drug addicts is 
unquestionably a difficult task. We know the motivations of 
drug dealers, but it is much more difficult to pinpoint the 
social and psychological reasons that lead a person to heroin. 
Even those who are supposedly specialists in the field do not 
agree on the most effective form of treatment. Secondly, such 
programs are extremely expensive and only lead to positive 
results after a number of years--even as long as a decade. The 
third reason results from the first: If they have to invest 
resources in combating drug addiction, politicians prefer to 
concentrate their efforts on repression, the results of which 
are more readily perceived by public opinion. However, if we 
took our time, results would follow. Consider what happened in 
the case of tobacco: Following years of campaigning to 
sensitize public opinion, consumption finally dropped. Why 
should it be impossible to do the same in the case of drug 
addiction? 
  Jauvert: To curtail demand, you advocate 
"decriminalizing" drug abuse. Why? 
  Kendall: Because regarding consumers as offenders 
serves no useful purpose. In fact, it is even dangerous. A 
convicted person discovers a culture in prison which may make 
him become something he was not when he first came in, namely, a 
criminal. Note, however, that I am speaking of decriminalizing 
drug abuse, not of legalizing it. I believe drug addicts must 
not be put in jail, but rather, forced to undergo treatment in a 
specialized medical center. 
  Jauvert: Are you in favor, then, of 
"decriminalizing" the use of heroin and cocaine as well as 
cannabis? 
  Kendall: Yes, medical doctors have muddled the 
issue for a long time by trying to draw a difference between 
"soft" and "hard" drugs. As a matter of fact, we now know that 
both are toxic products. The substance contained in cannabis, 
THC, is hazardous for the brain, its negative effects last 
longer than those of alcohol, for example. So why should the 
two types of drug be treated differently? 
  Jauvert: You said that the police should be able 
to force drug addicts to undergo treatment. In fact, this is 
now almost the case in France, with the so-called "therapeutic 
injunction," although few people are aware of this. Once 
arrested, drug users (as opposed to peddlers) can theoretically 
choose between treatment or prison. 
  Kendall: Yes, but this law is not being enforced 
through a lack of means. How many places are available in the 
specialized centers that can provide treatment for drug addicts? 
Ten, 20 times as many would be required in order to be 
effective. Throughout Europe, the state has so far relied too 
heavily on charity organizations. However, it is up to the 
state now to take the initiative. On the other hand, this 
choice between treatment or inprisonment seems to me to be 
inappropriate: Prison is in no case an effective solution. 
Drug addicts must be treated--even forced to do so--and doctors 
must be given the means to help them. 
  Jauvert: Forced? How? 
  Kendall: I do not know. It is the specialists who 
must decide. 
  Jauvert: Do you think doctors should be allowed to 
prescribe substitute products, such as methadone, or even heroin? 
  Kendall: Why not? If results can be achieved in 
this way... I have only one reservation: Substitute products 
should not replace one form of dependence with another for any 
great length of time. But, once again, this is a matter for 
specialists. 
  Jauvert: As a matter of fact, a few days ago, the 
highest medical authority in the United States announced it was 
favorable to legalization, purely and simply... 
  Kendall: I am totally opposed to such a view. 
  Jauvert: Why? 
  Kendall: Simply because legalizing drugs would 
automatically lead to an increase in consumption. Do you know 
why more and more people are in favor of legalization? Because, 
through laziness or ignorance, the phenomenon has been 
trivialized. When 400 kilos of cannabis are seized in Calais, 
who cares? Nevertheless, if tomorrow a chemical plant dumps 
toxic products into a river and kills some fish, that will stir 
up a scandal. Drug dealers do that every day, by placing 
products that are highly toxic to humans on the market, and 
nobody says a word. 
  Jauvert: Yet, alcohol and cigarettes are sold 
freely... 
  Kendall: So what? Two toxic products are already 
socially accepted. Is this a reason to add two more to the 
list? What else should be legalized next--crack, LSD? At what 
age? 
  Jauvert: It is also argued that legalizing drug 
consumption would reduce the incidence of crime. 
  Kendall: For a while, perhaps. But did the end of 
prohibition cause the mafia or gangsters to disappear in the 
United States? Of course not. Dealers will find other sources 
of profit. 
  Jauvert: Nevertheless, this solution is being 
advocated by policemen in many countries. 
  Kendall: True. I have recently discussed the 
subject with some British colleagues. A few years ago they 
would have said an outright "no" to decriminalization, whereas 
today some Scotland Yard officials are publicly posing the 
question of legalization. I understand their viewpoint. A 
policeman is there to enforce the law. Now, the laws on drug 
abuse are flouted a thousand times a day. So they ask 
themselves: Why not abolish them? It is a legitimate feeling, 
even if I do not share it. 
  Jauvert: So you believe that the moment has come 
to start a major debate? 
  Kendall: Yes, let everyone clearly express their 
opinion. Today Europeans are very sensitive to ethical and 
individual responsibility issues. Let us take advantage of 
this, before it is too late...

<H5>  Panama </H5>
  National Air Service Director Cristobal Fundora announced on 
5 January that drugs are still being smuggled into Panama 
through Chiriqui, Bocas del Toro, and Darien Provinces. Fundora 
explained that a shortage of resources, personnel, and equipment 
make it impossible for Panamanian authorities to properly 
protect the country's 3,000 km of coasts and the Colombian and 
Costa Rican borders. He added that over the next few weeks the 
Panamanian authorities will destroy a coca plantation of 
approximately 180 hectares maintained in Darien Province by the

  Peruvian counternarcotics authorities have disclosed in a 
report published in the newspaper EL COMERCIO that in 1993 
approximately 600 tons of cocaine sulfate were produced in the 
country. The report indicates that production is so high 
because the peasants are not only producing coca leaves but are 
manufacturing crude cocaine sulfate, and they have expanded coca 
production to several areas. Between January and October 1993, 
over 8,000 kg of drugs were seized and 38 clandestine labs 
destroyed by the authorities. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1549 GMT

  [Text] La Paz, 15 Dec (ANF) -- Defense Minister Antonio 
Cespedes and General Moises Schirique, joint chief of staff, 
have demanded "total control" over the U.S. funds that come to 
the country as military assistance and within the framework of 
bilateral agreements to fight drug trafficking. 
  The two high-ranking officials told this newspaper that "the 
U.S. military assistance is not in cash, and they administer the 
funds themselves. For instance, $1 million is promised, but 50 
percent or more is used to cover the movement and stay in 
Bolivia of their own personnel. They even import their own 
water with those funds." 
  The sources explained that if the United States delivered 
the 
funds assigned to military assistance in cash, no U.S. advisers 
would need to come to Bolivia, and "Bolivian professional 
soldiers would take over the jobs they fulfill in the midst of 
continuous controversies." 
  The defense minister said it would be very good if the Armed 
Forces were allowed to directly administer the U.S. military 
assistance. Gen. Moises Schirique told local media that "we 
would like the United States to give us the money to carry out 
the tasks they perform." 
  "It is undoubtedly something we must achieve gradually. The 
participation of our local contribution must increase and then 
take over altogether," Minister Cespedes Toro said, during the 
Engineering Military School 1993 graduation ceremony. 
  The Defense Ministry official contradicted the general in 
that Cespedes said the Armed Forces do not depend in any way on 
the U.S. Embassy, while Schirique said the U.S. technical 
cooperation "generates a certain dependence of the institution." 
  "What happens is not dependence, it is a plan for U.S. 
military assistance and support for the fight against drug 
trafficking," the minister said. 
  The U.S. assistance has been dropping in the continent for 
some time. Bolivia, due to the satisfactory level of its fight 
against drug trafficking, will apparently be affected by a 
smaller drop as compared to other countries in the region, the 
minister said. 
  "We still need to conduct bilateral negotiations on the 
matter," Defense Minister Antonio Cespedes Toro said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Government Minister German Quiroga by Mario </F>
Canipa Vargas in La Paz--no date given] 
  [Excerpts] Canipa: The government has been 
making changes since its inauguration last August. It is 
insisting on making changes. What are the changes made in your 
ministry? 
  Quiroga: There are three basic aspects we want to 
change in the transition from the old Interior Ministry to the 
new Government Ministry. 
  The first one is related to the intelligence services, which 
terrified the people in the past. This was the part of the state 
that investigated the possibility of a coup, of sedition. But we 
now believe that under a modern and established democracy like 
ours, these services must contribute to people's security, and 
along with its basic organization--which is the police--should 
be the support of the Bolivian people to give them daily 
security. 
  We are working on it. The first step taken is to 
institutionalize the intelligence services and put them in the 
hands of the police in order to prevent them from becoming an 
instrument of the political power that happens to be in charge 
of the Government Ministry. 
  Canipa: Is there no longer a Government Ministry 
intelligence service? 
  Quiroga: There is an intelligence service in the 
Government Ministry that depends on the police, and all its 
members are part of the Bolivian police. 
  This is closely linked to the changes in the police as part 
of the first aspect. [passage omitted] 
  Canipa: What will happen with the struggle against 
drug trafficking? Will it be included in these changes? 
  Quiroga: Of course. To start with we have changed 
the Social Defense Secretariat, which in the past was 
exclusively linked to the issue of coca and cocaine. It now has 
a wider role involving prevention and interdiction. 
  Although interdiction was an important role in the past, we 
believe alternative development is also an essential issue. It 
will not be possible to achieve an adequate replacement for 
surplus coca production if we are not able to find an economic 
solution. 
  The only way that an individual who grows coca stops doing 
it 
is when he realizes that growing another product is more 
profitable than growing coca from the economic point of view. 
  This is what we are working on. We have taken control of the 
fund for alternative development by changing its structure. We 
created an executive board presided over by a delegate of the 
president of the Republic, and its responsibility is shared by 
the executive branch and coca producers. 
  We would like to see the executive board create the ideas to 
carry out alternative development. 
  Eradication will be linked to alternative development. In 
those places where eradication is being carried out there will 
be alternative development, and where alternative development 
took place it was because there was a reduction in coca growing. 
  But I am not saying that we will eliminate interdiction. We 
will continue the work being carried out in the country but 
interdiction will be exclusively against drug traffickers, not 
against coca growers or people involved in the legal 
commercialization of coca. 
  We have a Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] that is an 
example for Latin America, and we will continue to support it 
because we believe that interdiction is essential. We also will 
carry out prevention as an overall part of our strategy, and 
this is why we created the Social Prevention Under Secretariat, 
which will deal with alcoholism, drug addiction, and crimes. 
This organization will help try to prevent these evils in 
society through teaching programs. 
  Canipa: To talk about successful and real 
alternative development, not just in speeches the way it is now, 
means talking about resources. How will you finance the 
alternative development projects to become a reality? 
  Quiroga: We are talking about three basic sources 
of financing. The first is the resource that drug trafficking 
itself produces. The country has many resources from drug 
trafficking that are lost with time. We are talking about a 
great deal of money, many assets that have been disappearing. 
  The one responsible was first the Interior Ministry; later 
it 
was a shared responsibility between prosecutors and the Interior 
Ministry. Now it is the responsibility of prosecutors and the 
judges who hand over the assets to trustees who later disappear. 
  We will propose that the legislative branch change the law 
to 
be able to immediately auction confiscated assets to create a 
common fund to support the people found innocent after their 
assets were confiscated. 
  With this fund we hope to finance 30 to 35 percent of the 
alternative development programs. 
  The second resource will be multinational organizations. The 
United Nations and the Inter-American Development Bank are 
interested in carrying out alternative development programs 
under the concept that the only way to do it adequately is 
through the industrialization of the areas where surplus coca is 
grown. 
  The third financing resource is the United States with 
bilateral aid. That country gave about $20 million to $25 
million annually for alternative development but a large part of 
those resources were used to pay salaries and not necessarily to 
carry out alternative development. 
  With these three resources, which are not from the national 
Treasury, in addition to some funds from the national budget, we 
believe we can carry out a good alternative development policy. 
  Canipa: Regarding interdiction, there has been a 
great deal of talk about the presence of Colombian drug 
traffickers in Bolivia. Is that true? 
  Quiroga: We have information about new technology. 
The technology used in the country is different from that used 
by the Medellin and Cali cartels. But in the last two years we 
have seen that the technology to produce coca and cocaine in the 
country has quickly improved. And this makes the narcotics 
intelligence organizations think there is permanent and decisive 
cooperation by the Colombian drug cartels. 
  Another aspect is that probably 80 percent of the drug 
produced in the country goes to Colombia. Whether it goes to 
Paraguay, Argentina, or Brazil, its final destination is 
Colombia, where the last stage of purification is made before it 
is sent to the United States. 
  Perhaps this is the most important reason to continue with 
interdiction, to prevent Colombian drug traffickers from 
establishing themselves in our country. 
  Canipa: Does this represent a threat of violence 
...? 
  Quiroga: Without any doubt, this may represent 
violence because the mafia is violent and we will not send nuns 
from a convent to fight against them. We must send outstanding 
officers against them because this is a war, a war in which the 
government, the police, have to fulfill the laws when the other 
side violates them. 
  Drug traffickers violate sovereignty, hurt the population by 
threatening them, and they also murder with impunity. 
  It is an unjust struggle because one side has laws and 
regulations to fulfill while the other side has absolutely no 
restrictions. 
  Canipa: Do you have a list of the main drug 
traffickers in the country? Who heads the list? 
  Quiroga: We have a permanent list that undergoes 
changes based on the arrests made. The number one in the country 
is "Meco" Dominguez who received a sentence and has escaped; he 
is at large. 
  There is also a list of nine individuals who are a number 
one 
priority for FELCN. Only two months ago the number one on that 
list was "Nando" Gutierrez, who was captured. As you can see it 
is a list that changes periodically. 
  We have a FELCN that is very efficient but the DEA's 
cooperation in this work must be recognized.

<F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina] </F>
  [Excerpts] The attorney general of the republic, Jorge 
Carpizo MacGregor, gave notice that "no one will deter us" in 
fighting the drug trade, and claimed that "this battle is for 
the nation's health." He also made a steadfast commitment to 
implement the arrest warrants issued for the members of the 
Tijuana Cartel, including the brothers Benjamin, Ramon, and 
Javier Arellano Felix, thereby to eliminate one of the most 
powerful rings engaged in drug trafficking. 
  The nation's attorney general declared: "We shall continue 
to 
intensify our unrestricted battle against organized crime, 
particularly the drug traffic; because this battle is for the 
health of our children and youth, and for the nation." He 
provided details on the capture of Francisco Rafael Arellano 
Felix, who is now confined in the maximum security federal 
prison at Almoloya de Juarez, in Mexico State. [passage omitted] 
  Carpizo MacGregor revealed that the institution, backed by 
the society, the National Institute to Combat Drugs, and even 
international authorities, is conducting "an extensive 
investigation to locate and apprehend those who are now 
fugitives from justice." 
  Describing the capture of the oldest Arellano Felix brother 
as a victory for Mexico, he claimed that the war against the 
drug trade can be won only if the government and society act 
together. He noted that such cooperation, through anonymous 
reports, contributed greatly to that operation, during which 
Luis Enrique Cortes Zatarain, Tomas Adan Velarde Espinosa, 
Benjamin de la Pena Farias, and Diego Gonzalez Martinez were 
captured as well. [passage omitted] 
  The assistant attorney for branch agencies and inspection, 
Mario Ruiz Massieu, in turn, explained: "Arellano Felix had been 
subject to three previous criminal suits: in 1978, with his 
wife, for crimes against health; again in 1988, for the same 
crimes; and a year later, for carrying a weapon reserved 
exclusively for use by the armed forces." He added that, in all 
three instances, the subject managed to evade the action of the 
courts, because one of the orders for his formal imprisonment 
was revoked and, on another occasion, the case records were 
lost. Despite this, the accused himself declared that he had 
been acquitted by a federal judge in Tijuana. 
  In the assistant attorney's opinion, Ramon, Javier, and 
Benjamin Arellano Felix are the heads of the so-called "Tijuana 
Cartel." He said that the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic] has now fully identified the members of that 
family who, although not directly linked with the drug traffic, 
have been aiding their relatives in money laundering and in 
managing the enormous fortune that they possess. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Espionage Team To Learn Police Action </H5>
  During this investigation, culminating in the capture of one 
of the Arellanos, it was discovered from the seizures made of 
communications equipment and systems that the drug traffickers 
had been following the activity, not only of the municipal and 
state police, but also of the federal force, step by step, using 
monitors. 
  Their equipment, of the most sophisticated type, besides 
tapping phone calls anywhere in the country, also managed to 
enter the authorities' restricted frequencies. In this way, the 
traffickers were learning first-hand about the action being 
planned against them. 
  Ruiz Massieu commented: "Through this discovery, it has been 
proven that drug traffickers listen to and tape conversations of 
PGR public servants. There is further evidence of this in the 
case of several employees of the newspaper EL MANANA, in 
Reynosa, Tamaulipas, who were remanded, and in the case 
involving the Ochoa Bali Hai restaurant. In the confiscated 
vehicles, cassettes with tapes of our officials' conversations 
were discovered, and some of the spies even attempted to imitate 
their voices." 
  He remarked that, in view of this situation, the authorities 
have changed the codes and frequencies used by the PJF [Federal 
Judicial Police]. [passage omitted] 
  Ruiz Massieu added that the exhaustive investigation of the 
Arellano Felix brothers, presumed to be the material 
perpetrators of the murder of Cardinal Jose Jesus Posadas Ocampo 
and of six other persons, has made it possible to capture and 
remand scores of members of various drug cartels. He commented: 
"At the time of his arrest, in order to procure his release, 
Francisco Rafael attempted to bribe the police agents with 
$100,000. As a result, he was also remanded for the crime of 
bribery in the degree of an attempt." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Veracruz, Ver., 8 December--Three presumed drug 
traffickers killed and four arrested were the results of an 
operation to rescue two Federal Judicial Police agents held 
captive since last weekend in Fortin. A total of 160 agents from 
the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], the 
State Judicial Police, and the Army participated in the rescue. 
  Tonight, in a communique, the representative of the Office 
of 
the Attorney General of the Republic, Marco Antonio Baez 
Cardoso, announced that seven other individuals escaped during 
the confrontation. They include an adult female and two minors, 
probably the wife and children of one of the criminals. 
  The Federal and State Judicial Police from Veracruz, backed 
by the Army, are advancing in the area and intensifying their 
efforts to capture these individuals. 
  The report explained that, as a result of the operation, in 
which there were no casualties among the Amry forces or police 
personnel, three of the presumed drug traffickers, including the 
so-called "Commander Rojo," were killed, and four others 
arrested. One of the latter sustained serious wounds. Two 
Federal Judicial Police agents, Miguel Barajas and Oscar Ortiz, 
who had been kidnapped, were rescued, and three vehicles were 
confiscated. 
  Tonight, the PGR announced that, on 6 December, Veracruz 
State Judicial Police personnel began the operations aimed at 
capturing 14 very well-armed persons, apparently under the 
influence of some drug. Wearing uniforms similar to those of the 
Army, they were staying at the El Pueblito Hotel, located in the 
municipality of Fortin de las Flores. 
  On the previous Saturday, those 14 subjects had put out of 
commission a small plane with Venezuelan registration, on which 
they may have been carrying drugs. The plane landed 
clandestinely in the vicinity of the El Palmar Experimental 
Center in the municipality of Tezonapa on 16 August of this 
year, and was subsequently confiscated. 
  Since those individuals had registered at the hotel as 
members of the Armed Forces of Mexico, "on a high-level military 
intelligence mission," an operation was mounted with the aid of 
the Veracruz State Judicial Police. 
  When the building was surrounded, in order to prevent injury 
to the guests occupying it, the police had to allow the alleged 
members of the military to escape, because they threatened to 
explode several grenades that they were carrying in a "poncho." 
  The office reported that four Federal Judicial Police agents 
were forced to accompany them, as virtual hostages. Later, using 
force and threatening to blow up everything around them, the 
criminals also abducted four other members of that corps. 
  After both the Army and Navy had been queried, a report was 
received indicating that no group had been commissioned, as 
those individuals claimed. The latter included Jorge Alberto 
Vazquez Gallardo, better known as "Comandante Rojo," and wanted 
for nearly 12 years because of his known connections with 
individuals engaged in drug dealing. 
  The operation was intensified on the afternoon of 6 December 
when, after pursuing those who pretended to belong to the 
military, the agents spotted them in the border zone between 
Veracruz, Puebla, and Oaxaca States: specifically, in the 
vicinity of the Tonto River. On the same night, six of the eight 
members of both corps who had been taken hostage were released. 
  The PGR noted that, owing to the conditions prevailing in 
the 
area, and the fact that these subjects are extremely dangerous, 
it was decided to postpone their action and to reinforce the 
operation. Hence, this morning, with the aid of a helicopter, 30 
Federal Judicial Police agents, reinforced by 60 Army troops and 
70 members of the Veracruz State Judicial Police, tightened the 
cordon and prepared for the attack.

  [Text] Guasave, Sinaloa, 6 December--One person dead and 
another wounded were found by soldiers and both federal and 
state police upon reaching a site where two small planes loaded 
with cocaine had stopped to refuel. The injured person himself 
made this disclosure. 
  The military-police operation began after those planes had 
flown over the settlement of La Brecha for 15 minutes. The 
agents seized four small trucks with treads, and without license 
plates, and 30 empty aviation fuel tanks, each with a 50-liter 
capacity. 
  A report provided by the 18th Cavalry Regiment's 
headquarters 
in San Miguel Zapotitlan and the State Judicial Police base in 
this municipality observes: "The community residents were 
alarmed when they noticed the planes flying over them, expecting 
them to crash. For this reason, they notified the police." 
  It adds that efforts were promptly coordinated between 
military forces and police agents; meanwhile, the two aircraft, 
with unidentified registrations, landed. Seven minutes later, 
bursts of machine gunfire were heard in an area adjoining that 
settlement. 
  The report states that the security brigades surrounded the 
area but, upon reaching the site, found only the body of one 
person showing AK-47 caliber bullet wounds in the abdomen, and 
another individual seriously injured. 
  The area is still cordoned off. The report concludes by 
noting that the body was taken to the PGR offices, and the 
wounded person is at a clinic, in serious condition and under 
heavy guard.

  [Excerpt] During antidrug operations conducted in 13 
federative states, over 6 tons of dried and packed marijuana 
about to be smuggled into the United States for sale and 
consumption were discovered and confiscated by Federal Judicial 
Police agents. The drugs were concealed in shipments of frozen 
cucumbers, tomatoes, chayotes, avocados, and alfalfa, as well as 
in boxes of detergent and toothpaste. According to reports, 49 
presumed public poisoners were arrested during the operations. 
  In making this announcement, the Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic [PGR] disclosed that 20 vehicles 
equipped with special compartments for concealing and carrying 
drugs were confiscated in the operations, and are now at the 
disposal of the agent of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. 
Also seized were two firearms, 32 useful cartridges of various 
calibers, and implements for "processing" narcotics. 
  The PGR added that the operations were carried out in 
Michoacan, Sonora, Tamaulipas, Durango, Nuevo Leon, Guanajuato, 
Oaxaca, Coahuila, Baja California, Chihuahua, Jalisco, Guerrero, 
and Veracruz. No incidents or confrontations between 
representatives of the law and criminals were reported. 
  It was specified that the most significant confiscation 
occurred in the municipality of Tiquicheo, Michoacan, where 
Felipe Araujo Arellano was arrested. He was carrying 3 tons and 
194 kg of cannabis indica in the body of a tractor trailer 
truck, concealed under 700 bags containing frozen cucumbers. He 
had purchased his shipment in the town of Nuevo Leon, and was 
attempting to take it to Reynosa, Tamaulipas, from which it was 
to be sent to the state of Texas, in the U.S. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Alvarado] </F>
  [Text] The economy of the towns of Nuevo Casas Grandes, 
Janos, Ascencion, and Juarez has embarked on a period of crisis 
due to the inactivity of drug traffickers in the region. This 
claim was made yesterday by the Federal Judicial Police first 
commander, Javier Norona Guerrero. 
  He declared: "People are complaining that there is no money, 
because the traffickers have stopped circulating their cash 
through various establishments." 
  Norona remarked that drug shipments through the region are 
no 
longer large, since dealers now prefer to risk only small 
quantities of their merchandise. 
  According to information obtained by the commander, towns 
such as Nuevo Casas Grandes, Janos, and Ascencion have lost 
business in jewelry and discotheque establishments. 
  Although to a lesser extent, Ciudad Juarez also has felt the 
effects of the battle against the drug traffic, because money 
laundering has declined, according to the commander. 
  He declared: "Drug dealing has been reduced and, in some 
towns, businesses are operating with very little money too, 
because of the lack of drug traffic." 
  Norona presumes that the investments made by drug 
traffickers 
will decrease, and remain at low levels during the coming 
months, as a result of a battle that has been started to curb 
them. 
  The operation called "Blockade Against Drugs and Weapons" 
provided for investigative and surveillance work by Federal and 
State Judicial Police [PJE] agents who, since its initiation, 
have been combing highways and villages in the northern 
Chihuahua region by air and land. Official reports obtained 
yesterday by the Sub-Agency of the Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic [PGR] indicated that, within just four 
days (1-4 December), the operation made it possible to seize 400 
kg of marijuana. 
  The Federal Police commander declared: "We are hitting the 
drug traffic very hard, and this will continue." 
  Norona took office as first commander in mid-November, after 
the PGR's representative in the state, Teresa Jardi, charged 
that the battle against the drug traffic had failed because of 
corrupt acts on the part of the previous commander. 
  Norona commented: "The volume of drugs that we seized early 
this month will be tripled before we finish." 
  In Nuevo Casas Grandes, a town that has seen the 
proliferation of shopping centers, discotheques, and jewelry 
shops in less than 10 years, the drug traffic has stopped 
injecting stratospheric volumes of capital, according to the 
commander. 
  Norona claims that the clearest sign that the same thing is 
about to occur in Ciudad Juarez is the fact that large drug 
shipments have stopped passing through that town during recent 
weeks.

  [Text] Mexico City, 16 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican 
Attorney General's Office (PGR) confiscated on 16 January a 
shipment of 52,356 kg [amount as received] of pure 
heroin--equivalent to 2 million doses--in the northern State of 
Baja California. 
  In a communique, the PGR reported that during the 
operation--one of the most important carried out in 
Mexico--authorities confiscated heroin that could have been sold 
on the U.S. black market for $20 million. 
  The communique added that five foreigners and three 
Mexicans, 
including a Postal Service employee who was used as a liaison to 
send the drug from Thailand to California, were arrested. 
  The report added that the drug was camouflaged in bottles of 
shampoo and soap and transported from Asia by Thai citizens 
Seachao Vern Chieng, Phan Saeng Vern, Vang Yao Fow, Seaphan Sou 
On, and Seaphan Aecho, all of whom have been arrested. 
  Mexican citizens Maricruz Barrera and Armida Aldaco, who 
were 
hiding suitcases containing 42 kg of pure heroin inside a 
closet, were also arrested. 
  The PGR also arrested Alfonso Romero Verdugo, head of the 
Mexican Postal Service in Ensenada, who was accused of receiving 
money from the presumed drug traffickers to use that office for 
drug shipments. 
  The source said that the eight detainees are confessed 
criminals, and they will be sent to the corresponding 
authorities to face charges for various crimes against health.

  [Excerpts] Retired Brigadier General Juan Ramon Rosa 
Rodriguez was installed this morning as the new National 
Antinarcotics Secretariat (Senad) executive secretary, replacing 
Division General Mario Escobar Anzoategui, who tendered his 
resignation last year. 
  Rosa Rodriguez ia a military officer who went into 
retirement 
a few years ago and served in the 3d Army Corps. Rosa Rodriguez 
took a course on drug trafficking in the United States. 
Therefore, he is supported by the U.S. diplomatic mission. 
  The president of the Republic, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, took 
considerable time in appointing the Senad head. The Senad 
reshuffle prompted "diplomatic" frictions between Wasmosy and 
U.S. ambassador to Paraguay Jon David Glassman. 
  It was actually the U.S. ambassador who announced that the 
new Senad head would be appointed sometime this week, at the 
latest. According to military sources, there were three 
candidates: One of them rejected the post and the other two 
were not approved by the U.S. mission. [passage omitted] 
  The president of the Republic, engineer Juan Carlos Wasmosy, 
has given "absolute liberty" to the new Senad head, retired Gen. 
Juan Ramon Rosa Rodriguez for the latter to properly discharge 
his new duties. Rosa Rodriguez noted that if he does not 
properly discharge his duties, it will not be because he is 
unwilling to do so, but because he does not have the elements 
required for it. 
  The president said: "I fully trust you and I ask everyone 
here and all the organizations to provide the support required 
for an all-out struggle against money laundering and crime." 
  Addressing Gen. Rosa Rodriguez, the president added: "You 
have all my support and the support of all levels of government 
to fight this scourge without any protection. [sentence as 
published] You have absolute liberty and the support of the 
national government to fight this evil." 
  Moving on, the president thanked U.S. Ambassador Jon 
Glassman 
for the assistance the U.S. Embassy has supplied our country to 
fight drug trafficking "because, sadly enough, our country is 
being used by criminals as a transit country." 
  The president concluded by saying: "I hope that all of us, 
united, some day may be able to wipe out this damned trafficking 
from America's Southern Cone." 
  Rosa Rodriguez 
  The new Senad head said: "Thank you very much for trusting 
me, Mr. President. I cannot promise more than dedication and 
honest effort, but I can assure you that if Senad does not 
properly meet your expectations, it will never be because of ill 
will, laziness, or malice, but it will be because our capacity 
and our means are not enough to fulfill your wishes." 
  This may be interpreted as a call to re-equip Senad, whose 
potential, according to Senad Assistant Secretary Colonel Cirilo 
Velazquez, is very small compared with drug traffickers' 
potential.

<F P=106> [From the "Newspaper of the Airwaves, Second Edition" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori has announced that drug 
trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, also known as El 
Vaticano, will receive a life sentence. The president said that 
the drug trafficker, who was deported from Colombia, was one of 
the leading drug traffickers in Alto Huallaga and his capture is 
comparable to Abimael Guzman's. 
  [Begin recording] [Fujimori] Chavez Penaherrera moved 
approximately 30 tons of drugs monthly and had his own airport 
in Campanilla. Every month he made approximately 40 flights and 
collected a total of $30 million. He was the main cocaine 
supplier for the Cali Cartel, which, in turn, exported almost 90 
percent of that cocaine to the (United States). In short, this 
has truly been a harsh blow to the drug trade. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What sentence will he get? 
  [Fujimori] We have passed very timely legislation on drug 
trafficking. Now we can give El Vaticano the maximum sentence: 
life in prison. There can be no doubt of that. I believe that 
for narcoterrorism, El Vaticano's capture is comparable to that 
of Abimael Guzman. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Fujimori] I repeat, two. (La Calena and Calavera) are 
brothers who have already been captured. [Editorial note: `La 
Calena' is Chavez Penaherrera's sister Berta Chavez and 
`Calavera' is Chavez Penaherrera's brother Humberto] There is 
an entire network of people who are involved and they have 
either been captured or are being investigated. This capture 
constitutes a terrible setback for narcoterrorism. [end 
recording] 
  This is what President Fujimori said at the closing of the 
academic year at the National Fine Arts School. The president 
announced that a new fine arts institute is going to be built.

  [Text] Drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, alias 
Vaticano--regarded as the Abimael Guzman of drugs--has been in 
the cells of the General Narcotics Directorate [Dirandro] since 
last night. One of the country's most wanted men, Chavez 
arrived in Lima last night, 15 hours after he was captured and 
deported from Colombia. He was immediately taken to the 
Dirandro cells, where he will remain for 15 days under 
investigation, according to existing laws. 
  It was reported no ad hoc prosecutor has been named to file 
the corresponding charges, although the drug trafficker has 
claimed innocence. Dirandro said Vaticano faces five summons on 
drug-trafficking charges. He will be presented to the media 
once the police investigation concludes.

  Nanning Prefecture has taken effective measures to conduct a 
special crackdown on drug trafficking and has achieved good 
results. According to statistics released by the relevant 
department, from June to 10 December this year, this prefecture 
cracked 46 cases of gun running and 75 drug trafficking cases, 
destroyed 22 gun-running and drug trafficking gangs, rounded up 
293 criminals, and seized 83 military firearms, 6,010 rounds of 
ammunition, 110 hand-grenades, 137.2 kg of opium, and 4.74 kg of 
heroin. 
  The main reason for the prefecture's success in the 
crackdown 
was the efforts of the prefectural party committee and 
government in extensively mobilizing the masses as well as the 
coordination between public security departments and frontier 
armed police units. (Text) (Nanning Guangxi People's Radio

Enforcement Unit and the police, five members of a narcotics 
gang have been arrested in connection with the seizure of about 
85 kg of hashish. Bilbahadur Thapa, Min Bahadur Gurung, and 
Bishnu Prakash Buda were found in possession of 358 capsules of 
hashish as they attempted to fly to Hong Kong. Based on their 
statements, Thuypten Tsering Sherpa was arrested at his home in 
Lalitpur, where 75.1 kg of hashish was seized along with four

  The Drug Enforcement Unit at the Karachi airport foiled 89 
drug smuggling attempts in 1993, leading to the arrest of 95 
people. They seized 555 kg of heroin powder, 10 kg of opium, and

<H5>  Women Being Used To Smuggle Drugs to Saudi Arabia </H5>
  A report says "the latest trend in smuggling heroin to Saudi 
Arabia is that women are being used for the purpose." The women 
come mostly from Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province and are 
paid about 20,000 rupees. They travel on fake passports issued 
on someone else's identification card, said to be easy because 
women's identification cards do not have photographs. In Saudi 
Arabia, "the gang has connections and agents receive the 
carriers and make arrangements for them." The report cites a 
late December incident in which a woman and her male companion 
were arrested while carrying 710 grams of heroin concealed on 
their bodies. Two other suspects, including the ring leader, 
escaped to Saudi Arabia. (Islamabad THE NATION in English 12

  [Text] Burma's military rulers are pressganging hundreds of 
Shan farmers from the Kengtung area into acting as porters in 
their current offensive against drugs warlord Khun Sa, according 
to some who recently escaped to the Thai border. 
  About 30 of the porters spoken to on Thursday at a small 
village on the border in northern Chiang Mai province said they 
were forcibly taken from their villages by the Burmese soldiers 
in early December. 
  They were taken by truck to Tachilek and told they would be 
carrying supplies for the Burmese army near the Karenni area. 
  The men, who arrived at the village in an emaciated and 
haggard condition, said they were forced to carry between 40 and 
80 kilos of weapons and food. 
  If they refused, they said, they were beaten. 
  "We were fed only a cup of rice per day and were treated 
worse than animals. It was more than a human being could take," 
said one man. 
  The refugees said they only realized they were being used in 
the offensive against Khun Sa when they arrived in the Doi Pang 
Thong area. 
  It is one day's walk from the current battle between Rangoon 
troops and the drugs kingpin's forces at Mong Jawd opposite 
Pieng Luang. 
  During the night, they fled to avoid getting involved in the 
fighting. 
  The men said they tried to find their way home, but instead 
ended up on the Thai border while trying to skirt around Burmese 
troops. 
  Several were injured by a landmine explosion while cutting 
though the jungle.

  [Excerpts] The coordination meeting No. 1/94 of the Work 
Committee for the Development of Border Areas and National Races 
[WCDBANR] was held in a new hall of the Ministry of Defense 
Services at 1430. Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of 
the WCDBANR and secretary-1 of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council [SLORC] attended the meeting and delivered 
an opening address. 
  In his opening speech, he said today's meeting is the work 
committee's first meeting in 1994. He added responsible 
personnel of the work committee have held coordination meetings 
whenever it is necessary even though the work committee does not 
want to hold meetings very often. He continued and said he 
coordinated development activities for Kachin Special Region-2, 
which are to be implemented by joining hands with the Kachin 
Independence Army [KIA]--an armed organization, with the 
chairman of the WCDBANR subcommittees. He said it has been 
nearly five years since the implementation of the development of 
border areas and national races began in May 1989. He noted 
that the implementation of development activities in the regions 
now have to be expanded for jungle-based organizations who are 
going to return to the legal fold. He continued that border 
areas and national races development activities are not the sole 
responsibility of the Ministry of Development of Border Areas 
and National Races and said all the ministries have to carry out 
these activities as if they are their main tasks. He said the 
implementation of border areas and national races development 
activities is actually the fulfillment of the three cardinal 
causes. [nondisintegration of the union, nondisintegration of 
national solidarity, and perpetuation of national sovereignty]. 
[passage omitted] 
  He then added that preparations must be made now to 
introduce 
for substitution crops for opium in the respective regions. 
When this is accomplished, the substitution crops can be 
cultivated effectively during opium growing season. That is why 
preparations are necessary to ensure the needed supply of seeds, 
saplings, machinery, fertilizer, and other equipment. [passage 
omitted] 
  Continuing, he said the state government has been carrying 
out border area development activities effectively and with 
genuine goodwill. One can see the gradual growth in urban and 
rural development when compared to the previous situation. The 
jungle-based armed organizations have realized their activities 
are not benefiting the country and local native people, and they 
also believe that the state government is really working for the 
benefit of national races in border areas. That is why, they 
are offering to hold peace talks. If the armed insurgencies 
subside in various border regions, these regions will become 
calm and the state government will be able to carry out more 
development activities than what is currently being done. 
[passage omitted] 
  He then added that we should look at the work being carried 
out to eradicate narcotic drugs in border areas. The 
destruction on 27 October of an old opium refinery and equipment 
by local natives near (Aunglankhet), (Khinpunlon) Village Tract, 
Kokang region should be hailed and documented. He noted that 
the state considers the eradication of narcotic drugs a national 
duty. This is the reason the creation of business enterprises, 
which will aim to completely eradicate the cultivation of 
narcotic drugs, was mentioned in the objectives of the Law on 
the Development of Border Areas and National Races. The law was 
proclaimed on 13 August 1993. He spoke next about the 
eradication of narcotic drugs in border areas. He said the 
state has reached an agreement on short- and long-term plans, a 
six-year plan in Kokang region and a 10-year plan in Wa region, 
with local leaders. That is why, regional work committees must 
keep a close eye on the annual reduction in narcotic drugs and 
their destruction in their respective regions. [passage omitted] 
  He concluded his opening speech by saying that one can see 
the state leaders' goodwill for national brethren by looking at 
the amount spent for the development of national brethren. 
[passage omitted] 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said in his closing speech that even 
though SLORC intends to carry out development activities in 
every state, priority has been given only to the poor states. 
The SLORC has realized that national development activities can 
only be carried out effectively and ultimately when there is 
national solidarity. The SLORC discussed and coordinated the 
return of jungle-based armed organizations to the legal fold to 
ensure national unity. Due to this invitation, some jungle-based 
armed organizations have made contact regarding their return to 
the legal fold. Some are holding discussions and coordinating 
at the lower level. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Four Countries Making Up the </F>
Golden Triangle Sign Drug Suppression Memorandum"] 
  [Text] According to a report from the UN office for drug 
control in Laos, on 26 October at the UN headquarters in New 
York the United Nations, in order to control international 
drugs, met with the LPDR, the PRC, Myanmar [Burma] and Thailand 
to sign a memorandum to tighten up cooperation in suppressing 
drugs in the Golden Triangle. 
  Mr Alounkeo Sittikoun, the LPDR representative, together 
with 
the representatives of the PRC, Myanmar [Burma], the Kingdom of 
Thailand and the director of the UN project to control 
international drugs met to sign this memorandum. The goal was to 
increase cooperation in controlling the drugs in this area of 
these countries and to assure the continuation of high-level 
consultations between these four governments and the United 
Nations in order to control international drugs with respect to 
the production of illegal drugs in this area, trafficking and 
violations. The memorandum also stated that the area of the 
Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia was an area of extensive drug 
production. For this reason the four countries, Laos, China, 
Myanmar and Thailand, reached an agreement with the UN office 
for the control of international drugs to increase cooperation 
in correcting the problem of widespread drug production, 
trafficking and use. The UN office for drug control is to 
provide technical assistance and funds to the governments of 
these four countries.

  [Text] NIGERIAN drug traffickers serving sentences in Thai 
prisons for drug convictions are being assisted by the Pakistani 
mafia bosses who hired them to smuggle the illegal drug, 
according to a group of Nigerian men now in Thailand on tourist 
visas. 
  The leader of the group, Mir Zafar, 32 and Amin Gaffy, 36, 
told the BANGKOK POST yesterday that the help provided by 
Pakistani mafias was aimed at boosting the morale of 
newly-recruited drug couriers so they do not fear arrest because 
they will not be forgotten. 
  The families of the jailed smugglers also receive material 
help from the Pakistani mafia bosses, he said. 
  Mr Zafar said this was a very shrewd way of luring new 
Nigerian couriers into carrying out the illegal work. 
  He and his group, who have made many trips to Bangkok, 
refused to talk about how their group was connected with the 
drug-trafficking operation. 
  However, he said professional drug couriers from his country 
are not afraid of being caught because they are sure that 
someone will help them and their families if they are imprisoned 
in a foreign country. 
  "All drug couriers have prepared themselves for all 
circumstances," he said. 
  Some couriers come from extremely poor families and the 
living conditions at Thai prisons was much better than in their 
hometowns, he said. 
  That is why they are not afraid of being caught, he said. 
  According to Mr Zafar, Pakistan mafias have linked their 
drug 
business to other international drug networks, by recruiting 
their own countrymen, Nigerians, African nationals, Mujahideen 
warriors from Afghanistan, Europeans and Chinese. 
  Pakistan mafias are influential in their country and also in 
the international drug network. 
  A study by a US accounting firm has estimated the entire 
black market economy in Pakistan at US$20.8 billion a year. A 
large portion of this income is from the drugs. 
  The profits allow enough for the drug mafias to penetrate 
the 
Pakistani state and economy at all levels, such as supporting 
political parties in election campaigns. 
  The profits also allow the drug mafias to buy protection at 
the highest political levels in Pakistan, the report said. 
  According to Mr Zafar, the methods to save jailed drug 
couriers include using its own human rights group to launch 
campaigns against the Thai government and Corrections Department 
officials for alleged inhumane treatment of foreign prisoners 
with the hope of getting better treatment from the authorities. 
  Such campaigns include accusing the prison authorities of 
providing poor food to foreign prisoners so that they will get 
better food or be allowed to purchase food from outside. 
  Foreign prisoners who are jailed on drug offences will 
always 
have enough money to buy things in prison as they are provided 
with cash by their Pakistani boss. 
  Pakistani mafias always plan to find ways for the 
repatriation of their couriers, he said. 
  But Mr Zafar said drug trafficking from Burma, formerly 
routed through Thailand, has been reduced in recent months 
because of tough measures by narcotics officials. 
  The masterminds have already changed to new supply routes 
from Burma to China or Bangladesh for shipment to other parts of 
the world. 
  Narcotics officials late last year arrested many Nigerian 
couriers and seized several hundred kilogrammes of heroin, he 
said.

  [Text] NIGERIANS and people from other African countries 
who have been hired by Pakistani drug ring leaders to smuggle 
heroin from Thailand to other parts of the world have kept a low 
profile, Nigerian tourists said. 
  The Nigerian tourists, Mir Zafar, 32, and Amin Gaffy, 36, 
who 
are now visiting Thailand, said it was possible that smuggling 
of narcotics out of Thailand had been suspended for the time 
being as many key drug traffickers were arrested last month. 
  The two Nigerians were referring to an announcement made by 
the Narcotics Suppression Bureau (NSB) last month that about 400 
kg of heroin, including the 259 kg which was smuggled from 
Thailand by sea to Nigeria, was seized in Lagos on December 30. 
  Heroin destined for Lagos from Thailand was seized on 
several 
occasions and a number of suspected Nigerian drug traffickers 
arrested. 
  Tbe two Nigerian tourists who are interested in narcotics 
affairs in Asia, especially Thailand, said that although major 
narcotics routes from Burma, via Thailand, to international 
markets are being blocked, it does not mean that the heroin 
trafficking from this country to other parts of the world would 
be halted in the longer run. 
  The two who arrived in Bangkok last week said Pakistani 
mafias had played their key roles in recruiting Africans and 
Nigerians as drug couriers and had formed a human rights group 
to launch campaigns against the Thai government for alleged 
inhumane treatment of foreign prisoners including Nigerians 
serving sentences for drug offences. 
  The Pakistani drug ring leaders stil exist but they have 
kept 
a low profile since the large heroin seizures, the Nigerian 
tourists said. 
  Officials from the Office of the Narcotics Control Board 
(ONCB) said yesterday that they are following suspected foreign 
drug couriers now in Thailand. 
  They will be arrested when sufficient evidence is acquired, 
they said.

  [Text] The government has stepped up its campaign against 
narcotics. Customs, intelligence, and police have conducted 
various successful raids across the country and seized huge 
quantities of narcotics, including heroin and charas, during the 
last one month. 
  In the biggest-ever haul in Lahore today, city police seized 
about 1.5 tonnes of morphine powder and arrested three drug 
couriers. The smuggling attempt was foiled last night in the 
Bund Road area. The material was being smuggled on a truck 
loaded with 497 drums; 50 of them were filled with morphine 
powder. The city policy chief said the three alleged drug 
couriers--namely Haji Nisar Khan, Akhtar Khan, and Javed 
Khan--were arrested while raids are being conducted to arrest 
Mahmud Butt and Mujadded Butt. 
  The recent antinarcotics drive is the result of the present 
government's resolve to eradicate the menace from its roots. 
The government has set the year 2000 as the target for complete 
eradication. It is one of the eight points given by the 
Pakistan People's Party in its election manifesto. A Narcotics 
Control Board and the Ministry of Law are working on a draft law 
which will enable the law enforcing agencies to act more 
effectively. Besides other measures, the government also plans 
to enhance its mass awareness campaigns. 
  Fifty tonnes of charas was seized recently when 
antinarcotics 
agencies and Pakistan Customs jointly carried out an operation 
at Makran coast. In the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province], 20 
kg of heroin was seized recently when it was being smuggled from 
the tribal area to Peshawar for down-country dispatch. In 
another raid, 12 kg of heroin was seized at Azadi Chowk post; 
three persons were arrested. A large quantity of heroin and 
charas was also seized at different places in Balochistan.

<F P=106> ["Special report" by Ayesba Haroon] </F>
  [Text] The seizure rate of heroin, opium and charas by the 
12 Federal and provincial law-enforcing agencies, till June 
1993, shows a sharp decline as compared to the corresponding 
period in 1992. 
  Lack of political will showed itself in poor allocations of 
finances to these agencies and a legal cover riddled with [word 
indistinct] and loopholes that gape so wide that entire 
battalions of offenders slip through them. A glaring legal 
omission being the jurisdiction of speedy law court does not 
cover FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas]--hot spots for 
drug production and trafficking. 
  The accumulative effect of the lopsided political will and a 
Swiss cheese legal set-up reflects in poor follow-up of 
registered cases, lower seizures, and a social climate that 
offers no resistance to narco money. Given the fact that around 
two-thirds of the heroin produced in Pakistan is consumed within 
the country and that the number of drug addicts is on the rise, 
reduced seizures do not mean that production or trafficking of 
narcotics has been curtailed--as some members of the Narcotics 
Control Division would have the public believe. 
  From 2,900 kilograms (kg) of heroin seized in 1992, the 
figure has fallen to 2,179 kgs in 1993. And when compared to 
5,677 kgs of heroin seized in 1991, the quantity seized has more 
than halved. Number of cases registered have also fallen 
sharply--from 23,494 in 1992 to a mere 10,296 in 1993. Quantity 
of opium seized has also fallen by around 1000 kg. In 1992, 
3,422 kgs of opium were seized, but the figure slid down to 
2,421 kgs in 1993, and from 2,850 cases registered the number 
was reduced to 1,448 in 1993. 
  In the case of the charas, the quantity seized reduced from 
188,123 kgs in 1992 to 138,097 kgs in 1993. While the number of 
cases registered in 1993 were 9,618 as compared to the 20,847 
case registered in 1993. 
  Successive governments tried to prove their commitment 
towards eradicating the drug menace by making all sorts of 
speeches. However, no-one worked to develop an effective legal 
framework to effectively check this menace. The caretaker 
government of Moin Qureshi, promulgated an Ordinance, whereby 
the death penalty would be awarded to the drug offenders: namely 
the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Ordinance, 1993 whereby the 
assets of an accused awarded punishment lesser than life 
imprisonment are also liable to forfeiture. 
  The law against narcotics offences relating to trafficking 
provided for maximum punishment of life imprisonment. The 
government has decided to amend the law in order to award death 
sentence for the drug traffickers or financing the trafficking 
of narcotics or offences relating to import or export of drugs 
from Pakistan and inter-provinces. 
  Narcotics offences are mainly dealt with under the following 
laws: The Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930; The Prohibition 
(Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979; The Customs Act, 1969; The 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1989 (Act V of 1898); The Police 
Act, 1861; The Opium Act, 1957; The Opium Act, 1878; and The 
Anti-Narcotics Task Force Ordinance (XII of 1993). 
  There are 14 [as published] agencies on Federal and 
provincial level that are involved in the enforcement of the 
above-mentioned laws. Apart from the provincial police 
departments, provincial Excise Departments and the Frontier 
Constabulary of NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] all other 
law-enforcing agencies come under the ambit of the Federal 
Government. The services of the defence forces can also be 
utilised for the purposes whenever the Federal Government 
decides. 
Given the fact that there is such a large number of varied 
agencies involved and seven different laws to deal with 
narcotics offences. It is not a wonder that a complete 
confusion prevails. An offence registered under the Hadd cannot 
be punishable by death penalty and an injunction of the speedy 
courts is not applicable to the federally and provincially 
administered tribal areas; while different laws apply to the 
carrier and to the offender who finances the trafficking. 
  Lack of efficient coordination between the various 
government 
agencies involved, the [word indistinct] inherent in partial 
application of the laws, coupled with the fact that money and 
political pressure can delay/change/erase the cases is used by 
the offenders to their maximum advantage. Also the Narcotics 
Control Board cannot spend the kind of money the offenders use 
while fighting legal cases against them. In one case, while the 
Ministry used around Rs [rupees] 3 lakh, the offenders spent a 
hefty Rs 33 lakh--and went scot-free. 
  Not only are the agencies short of manpower but the 
personnel 
is also not provided with adequate personal security to deal 
with dangerous offenders. While the agencies are unable to 
coordinate their actions, the drug barons are equipped with the 
advanced electronic gadgets for surfeiting the movement of the 
agencies. 
  The law-enforcing agencies have failed to control the 
smuggling of acetic anhydride, the chemical used in making 
heroin. Previously, it was imported in abnormal quantity but 
after its import was restricted, it started being smuggled in 
from India. Recently a group of Rangers was booked for smuggling 
the chemical from India. 
  In a bid to give a modicum of sanity to the to the mess, the 
President and the Prime Minister [PM] have asked for 
recommendations to formulate a national drug policy which 
contains a comprehensive legal package. It is stated to be a 
long-term policy. The PM's camp wants to make it a consensus 
legislation which would fetch them points both at home and 
abroad. 
  To restrict the inflow of drugs in their country the United 
States of America made clear its dissatisfaction regarding the 
performance of the local anti-narcotics agencies a few years 
back and announced the funding of a special tasks force. The 
Ordinance for the force was repeatedly promulgated and a number 
of officers from the services other than those involved in drug 
combat were selected, but the force could not take off. 
  However, according to sources, the Americans reduced their 
funding and in the second half of last year, the Army was asked 
to take over the proposed organisation. A serving general is 
now heading the force, which is still to commence active 
operations. Unless anti-drug operations are supported by the 
political will of the rulers, not much headway can be expected 
in combating this menace. There needs to be social uprising 
against the narco barons and their influence in political, 
bureaucratic and professional bodies must be exposed. Otherwise 
we will enter the 21st century drugged out of our senses.

  [Text] A Ghanaian-born businessman has been sentenced to 24 
years in jail for his involvement in smuggling 160 million 
pounds worth of Colombian cocaine into Britain. (David Katcher), 
42, of Manchester in northern England, was convicted last July 
at a New Castle court on two charges of importing cocaine and 
[words indistinct] weighing one and a half pounds. The sentence 
was delayed so that [words indistinct] and profits made from the 
clients seized. But the court was told (Katcher) received only 
320,000 pounds out of which only 8,850 pounds was recorded. 
  (Katcher), who runs textiles and building firms and was 
exporting construction machinery to Ghana, turned to cocaine 
smuggling because of huge debts. After the cocaine and the 
first shipment in October 1991 was distributed and sold, a 
tip-off to customs officers led to the second load being 
intercepted in a wave of arrests in Togo in 1992.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 19 December 1993 issue of the Poznan 
weekly WPROST reports that "Poland is becoming the best place 
for distributing narcotics to West Europe, a money-laundering 
station, and an area for hiding narcotic wares." Adam Szyszko, 
chief of the Second Department of the National Interpol Bureau, 
told the Poznan weekly that since the outbreak of war in the 
former Yugoslavia, which was the "traditional country that acted 
as a transit point for drugs to West Europe, the `Polish idea' 
has attracted drug gangs." Interpol is said to believe that the 
equivalent of millions of dollars of narcotics-tainted money is 
in Polish banks. 
  Since 1990, Poland has become a "transit port" for 
narcotics. 
WPROST says that Colombian cocaine and West African hashish and 
marijuana make their way to either the ports of Szczecin and 
Gdynia or to Warsaw's Okecie airport, from which they are 
shipped to France, Germany, and Great Britain. Figures on 
customs seizures indicate that Okecie airport is being used more 
often than it had been in the past. On 1 December, for example, 
the Polish Customs Service seized a half-ton of marijuana that 
had arrived on a KLM flight from Lagos, Nigeria, marked as fish. 
"Just the fact that the shipment was from Nigeria caused 
suspicion because we do not import fish from that region into 
Poland," said one official. 
  Interpol's Szyszko says that the couriers are often 
protected 
by diplomatic immunity, which "seriously complicates the 
situation." The ambassador of Costa Rica himself was caught at 
Okecie airport with 12 kg of heroin in his baggage. 
  One of the most ingenious plans was devised by German 
smugglers. As Mr. Szyszko describes it, large parcels of 
narcotics were to be sent to Poland, where they would be 
repackaged, receive new papers, and be sent on their way to 
Hamburg to cover up the sources of the drugs. 
  WPROST points out that the efforts of Polish Customs 
officials to suppress the drug trade are hampered by Polish law, 
which does not make mere possession and consumption of drugs a 
crime. New banking laws have been enacted to prevent the use of 
Polish banks for drug-money-laundering schemes, but there are 
still loopholes that permit such schemes to flourish. 
  WPROST notes that the involvement of international organized 
crime has further complicated enforcement efforts. According to 
Szyszko, these groups are far better organized and technically 
skilled than are Polish criminal groups. According to another 
official, both the Italian Mafia and the Colombian Cali cartel 
are involved in drug smuggling through Poland, with the Cali 
cartel reportedly using Polish couriers to smuggle narcotics 
over the Polish-German border. WPROST reports that police 
consider the production and smuggling of amphetamines to be one 
of the most dangerous recent developments. In the first quarter 
of 1993, seven and a half tons of these synthetic drugs were 
confiscated. Szyszko says that foreign money, principally from 
the United States, is funding Polish amphetamine production. 
  The 28 December Warsaw daily ZYCIE WARSZAWY reports that 
special police units have been formed to fight organized crime. 
These units, which will be several-hundred-policemen strong and 
will be under the direction of a Bureau for Fighting Organized 
Crime, were scheduled to become operational on 1 January. The 
bureau's work will be classified at the top secret level. It 
already has 26 domestic and foreign groups operating on Polish 
territory as its targets. Departments of the bureau will be 
opened in Krakow, Katowice, Wroclaw, Szczecin, Lodz, Gdansk, 
Poznan, Lublin, Bialystok, Olsztyn, and Bydgoszcz.

<F P=106> [Andreas Zenker report: "Police Alarmed--Drug Scene Is </F>
Escalating"] 
  [Excerpt] The Viennese drug scene is bigger than ever 
before: There are 40,000 consumers of cannabis, 6,000 cocaine 
addicts, and 8,000 heroin addicts. In 1993, police mobilized 
all their personnel resources to fight drug trafficking. The 
1993 internal report by the police drug section is devastating. 
This is an exclusive report by DIE PRESSE: 
  "We are losing track of the overall picture," the report 
says. The number of police arrests rose from 849 in 1992 to 
1,370 in 1993; there was a record number of official 
investigations [Amtshandlungen] leading to over 100 arrests; and 
a spate of suspected offenses was reported to the police. 
  "The former Eastern Bloc countries are now being used as 
caches by the producer countries. Large amounts of drugs are 
smuggled into Austria by all means imaginable and sold here," a 
police official said. The dealers have organized themselves 
into groups and are working in a very professional way. "We 
have begun to sense this in 1993 for the first time." 
  The dealers work in complete isolation. Third countries 
build up huge caches in Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech 
Republic. The local drug scenes in these countries have gotten 
completely out of hand. Then smugglers are hired. 
  "Eighty percent of drug dealing is controlled by Turks and 
Yugoslavs," the investigating authorities say. The "stuff" is 
brought into Austria in cars, buses, or aboard ships; yet the 
quantities are always less than 1 kg. [passage omitted]. 
  The Vienna Drugs Scene 1993 
  Figures for 1992 given in brackets 
  Arrests: 1,370 (849) persons were arrested under the 
Addictive Drugs Act; 
  House searches: 1,491 (544); 
  Deaths caused by addictive drugs: 102 (93). The final 
figure will not be available before the end of January. 
  Drugs seized: Cannabis--24.4 kg (44.7); heroin--16.1 (11.3); 
cocaine--3.5 (2.4); LSD--109 doses (1,142); opium--0.3 (1.1); 
  The black market value of the drugs seized is some 40.4

grenades--10 (none); rifles--one (five); tear gas sprays--128 
(three); 
  Solved crimes committed by drug addicts: One bank robbery 
involving 2.3 million schillings; 11 muggings; 16 burglaries; 70 
cases of fraud; 40 prescription forgeries; three car thefts;

  [Text] Two cocaine dealers were arrested at the Bad 
Fischau (Wiener Neustadt district) service station, located on 
the southbound motorway. Gerhard S. (32) and Oswald L. (32), 
both from Vienna, had offered 120 grams of the drug, worth 
100,000 Austrian schillings, to an undercover investigator. 
  Gerhard S. had bought 400 grams of cocaine in Rio de Janeiro 
for the equivalent of 60,000 schillings and smuggled the drugs 
to Austria. He sold some 70 grams in Vienna and consumed 
another portion of the cocaine himself. Another 148 grams were 
seized during a house search in Vienna's fifth district last 
year, as a result of which Gerhard S. spent three weeks in 
prison.

<F P=106> [Article by Alain Lallemand: "Turkish Extreme Right, </F>
Ankara's Objective Ally"] 
  [Text] Who are these "Gray Wolves" in Belgium which 
Interior Minister Louis Tobback is accusing of leading the 
anti-Kurd demonstrations of recent days? 
  Their official name is "Turk-islam Federasyonu" or "Belcika 
Turk-islam Kultur Dernekleri Federasyonu," which can be 
translated as "Turkish-Islamic Federation" or "Federation of 
Turkish-Islamic Cultural Associations of Belgium." The Belgian 
headquarters of this federation is in Beringen, and its European 
headquarters are in Frankfurt. It is also supported actively at 
international level by the Turkish Government, which denies 
this, as might be expected. 
  As an extremely dangerous extreme right movement, it is an 
avatar of Colonel Alparslan Turkes' fascist nationalist party. 
Highly active in the late 1970's and 1980's, its members 
specialized in guerilla warfare and the murder of progressive 
politicians. They also engaged in heroin trafficking in order 
to finance their activities. 
  However, they are even better known for their direct 
involvement in the failed attempt against Pope John-Paul II in 
May 1981. If we are to believe the Turkish daily, MILLIYET, the 
person who fired the shots in Saint Peter's square in Rome, Ali 
Agca, was allegedly harbored for a while with the Belgian 
representative of the "Gray Wolves," Selahattin Saygin, in 
Maasmechelen. 
  Do the "Gray Wolves" also benefit in Belgium from the 
relative leniency of the Turkish authorities? Of course: In 
1986, during the third conference of "Gray Wolves" of Belgium, 
the fundamentalist Turkish newspaper, DUSUNCE, reported that 
apart from Selahattin Saygin, the Turkish consul from Antwerp, 
Feyha Enc, and the Turkish minister of health, Halil Sivgin, 
also appeared at the podium. 
  Belgium is also used by the "Gray Wolves" for heroin 
trafficking. This information has already been published several 
times in LE SOIR, but it should again be pointed out that one of 
the "Gray Wolves'" most famous activists, Oral Celik, alias 
Bedri Ates (borrowed name), was arrested on 10 November 1986 in 
Halluin by the French customs authorities, while leaving our 
country with 3.6 kg of heroin. Concealed under a false 
identity, he has since admitted that he was indeed the extreme 
right activist fingered by his fellow terrorist, Ali Agca. 
  Further evidence of the criminal activity of the "Gray 
Wolves" in Belgium was the presence in September 1990 in the 
Liege suburbs of Ahmet Esensoy, who was involved in heroin 
trafficking and was the right-hand man of Rifat Yildirim, one of 
the most famous "Gray Wolves" terrorists. Esensoy, who has 
since been apprehended, was in transit. A generally reliable 
source says that there are allegedly comings and goings between 
Belgium and the Frankfurt "city bazaar," the preferred spot of 
the "Gray Wolves."

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service Report: "Large Narcotics Gang </F>
Uncovered"] 
  [Text] The Narcotics Violations Office of the Helsinki 
Police is in the midst of investigating a narcotics ring that is 
exceptionally large for Finland. Over the course of the 
investigation, the police have held 85 persons for questioning 
and charged 20 with smuggling and distributing narcotics. 
  On Tuesday [23 November], the case came up for trial in 
Helsinki Municipal Court, where the prosecutor read an 
indictment for aggravated narcotics violations against a 
25-year-old man from Kervo. Further indictments are expected 
against the other members of the gang. 
  The gang has been operating in the Helsinki region, the 
Turku 
area, and [other places] on the west coast. It is suspected of 
having distributed and sold tens of kilograms of hashish, much 
heroin and amphetamines, as well as the drugs LSD and ecstasy, 
both of which have rarely been found in Finland. 
  The police seized a little over 1 kg of hashish and around 
100 kg of amphetamines, as well as small amounts of other drugs. 
  Gang members are between age 17 and 35 and most have never 
had prior involvement with the police. The suspected gang leader 
worked full time on narcotics trafficking. 
  The gang has been operating for approximately one year, and 
has constantly grown by recruiting new members. The police 
believe the organization has spun off a number of smaller 
subgroups, which remained loosely tied to each other. 
  The police got on the gang's trail last spring. The full 
extent of the case is still not known. The police will still not 
say from where the drug ring originated. 
  This drug ring is not the same one confirmed a short time 
ago 
of distributing "superheroin."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Four Imprisoned in Vantaa 11-Kg </F>
Hashish Case"] 
  [Text] Four men were sentenced to prison in Vantaa 
Municipal Court for distributing some 11 kg of hashish. The 
hashish, which was brought in from Russia, was sold in nearby 
Helsinki. About 1.5 kg were seized in the arrest. The main 
figure in the hashish ring is thought to be Keijo Changklung 
(formerly Saira), who was sentenced to a prison term of 32 
months for selling 7.5 kg. He will have no chance of early 
parole. Petri Niemela received a sentence of 26 months for 
having purchased 3.2 kg of the substance from Changklung, and 
another 2.7 kg directly from Russia. 
  Previously sentenced in the case was Kari-Pekka Diomin, who 
bought 2.5 kg of hashish from Changklung. Diomin was sentenced 
to a year in prison, with no possibility of parole. 
  The Russian-born Israeli citizen Gay Dagan received a 
one-year prison term, with possibility of parole, for having 
distributed a shipment of drugs received from a Russian citizen. 
  The East Uusimaa Area Investigation Unit, which is 
headquartered in Vantaa, handled the case, since it was the 
first to learn of the drug selling activity. The drugs were sold 
in nearby areas of Helsinki, i.e., in the Martina Restaurant on 
Hameetie and in the Cafe Miina in Hakaniemi. 
  Those convicted were also ordered to pay damages to the 
state 
amounting to a total of 70,000 markkas.

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "Nearly Four Years in Prison </F>
for Drug Courier in Lahti"] 
  [Text] The Lahti Municipal Court handed a drug courier a 
prison term of almost four years. The 45-year-old Lahti former 
businessman was arrested in October by Swedish Customs 
authorities, with a quantity of almost 8.5 kg of hashish in his 
possession. A body search of the man after his arrival in 
Finland additionally turned up four kg of amphetamines. 
  The man has kept silent during the court proceedings. In 
addition to being sentenced for two cases of aggravated drug 
smuggling, he was also convicted of four firearms violations. He 
did admit to having four illegal weapons in his possession. 
  The man received a prison term of 46 months. He will have to 
reimburse authorities in the amount of 120,000 markkas. This sum 
will pay for a reward in the amphetamines case and the cost of a 
fancy rental truck he used for transporting the hashish. It will 
also pay the fine for the illegally obtained firearms. 
  Lahti Municipal Court determined the value of a submachine 
gun to be 500 markkas, or the amount that the Armed Forces will 
have to pay for a replacement.

<F P=106> [Article by Susanna Reinboth: "Sentences for Men </F>
Manufacturing Amphetamines Reduced by Appeals Court"] 
  [Text] The Helsinki Court of Appeals has reduced the 
sentences imposed on the operators of an Espoo amphetamines 
laboratory by several months. 
  An amateur chemist who had manufactured amphetamines 
received 
a sentence of three years and eight months. The Espoo District 
Court had sentenced him in June to four years in prison. 
  According to the court, the chemist had made a total of just 
under 2 kg of amphetamines. Over a kilogram of the drugs ended 
up being sold, but the chemist did not know how to distribute 
them. 
  The sentences of the chemist's partners in crime were also 
slightly reduced. Two of the men received prison sentences of 
four years and eight months and the third man got four years and 
three months. The sentences meted out by the district court had 
been several months longer. 
  During the trial the chemist claimed that he had 
manufactured 
the amphetamines in cooperation with the police. According to 
the chemist, the police's plan was to catch the men who ran the 
drug ring. 
  Because of his claims, the police who were examined in 
connection with the chemist were suspected of being guilty. They 
were suspected of incitement to commit drug crimes and of breach 
of duty. After the preliminary investigation, Provincial 
Prosecutor Lasse Apio decided that there was not enough proof to 
bring charges against them.

<F P=106> [Article by Katri Peltola: "Feelings Heat Up in the </F>
Parliamentary Debate on Drugs"] 
  [Text] The opposition would have preferred lighter 
penalties for drug use than at present. During the plenary 
session on Friday [19 November] 173 members of the Eduskunta 
absented themselves from the vote. 
  The Eduskunta wants to retain drug use as a punishable act, 
but a heated debate was engaged in during the plenary session on 
Friday on the penalties prescribed by law. During the return 
debate two bills were proposed, through which drug violations 
would be transferred to the penal code. 
  The government essentially wants to preserve the present 
penalties. Some members of the opposition would be willing to 
lighten the maximum penalties prescribed by law because they are 
simply not applied under current practice. 
  The members of the the Parliamentary Laws Committee engaged 
in such a thorough debate on drugs that the other members of the 
Eduskunta managed to beat a hasty retreat to their home grounds. 
Fully 173 of the 200 members of the Eduskunta were absent from 
the last vote of the plenary session at 1635 hours. 
  The vote related to the question as to whether the disputed 
agriculture fund should be taken up for preliminary debate on 
Monday or Tuesday. Some members of the Eduskunta would have 
preferred to postpone debate on the issue until Tuesday so that 
they would have time to obtain even more information on the 
matter. However, the Speaker's Council proposal that it be 
debated on Monday won out by a vote of 14 to 12. 
  The government is proposing that the illegal manufacture, 
importing, exporting, transporting, distribution, possession, 
and use of drugs be written into the revised penal code. 
  At the same time the minimum penalty for a drug felony would 
increased to one year in prison. 
<H5>  Origin of Illegal Money Must Be Reported </H5>
  So-called money laundering would become a crime. Among other 
things, banks would be obligated to report to government 
officials if they suspect that a client is trying to conceal the 
origin of money obtained illegally. 
  Justice Minister Hannele Pokka (Center Party) maintained 
during the debate that the kind of maximum penalty for drug use 
that is to be written into law is not a matter of indifference. 
In her opinion, former Justice Minister Tarja Halonen's (Social 
Democrat) "approach" to lowering the maximum penalty would be a 
clear message to international criminals, among others. She was 
supported by Conservative Kari Hakamies. "I am not willing to 
accept the proposition that a faulty sentencing practice is a 
good one," Halonen contended. 
  In agreement with Halonen's position was the Greens' Satu 
Hassi, according to whom Pokka "is feigning ignorance" of the 
fact that the intent, in connection with revision of the penal 
code, is to write into law those penalties that are actually 
applied. According to Hassi, there are no differences of opinion 
on that point. On the other hand, according to him, there should 
be a sharper distinction between penalties for using and selling 
drugs. 
  During the debate concern was also raised over whether drug 
users know that they can seek treatment without fear of being 
caught. 
  Vesa Laukkanen, representing the Alternative for Finland 
group, thought that the threat of punishment influences those 
who are not using drugs. Users, however, can, of course, seek 
treatment if they want to. 
  The government was also encouraged by the Eduskunta to look 
into how a stage of treatment could be included in sentences. 
  Members of the Eduskunta representing the government parties 
and the opposition were united in their concern over the 
widespread use of drugs in prisons. [passage omitted]

November, which is 412 fewer than in the same period in 1992 
(1,870). During the whole of 1992, 2,099 people died of drug 
consumption (2,125 in 1991). A narcotics agent gave the 
following reason for the decline: "Heroin has become cleaner. 
It is no longer diluted with other substances so often."

citizens who entered from Turkey was inspected, and small 
packages of heroin totaling 37 kg were found and confiscated. 
  In Khania, customs officials found and confiscated 442 kg of 
Indian cannabis after searching a British yacht coming from

  [Text] Customs officials at Kipoi border checkpoint in 
Evros have captured the leader of a ring which tried to come 
through carrying 19 kg of heroin. Correspondent Yeoryios 
Feretis has the details. 
  [Feretis] For some time now the biggest heroin trafficker 
from Pakistan (Fahd Salahuddin), 30, was wondering why all his 
associates get stopped at the customs checkpoint at Kipoi, 
Evros, and cannot get the heroin to European countries. 
Therefore, he attempted to transport the heroin himself. He 
took a luxurious Mercedes that he recently bought from a U.S. 
senator, and at about 2300 he arrived at the Kipoi checkpoint. 
Customs officials welcomed him and when he said that he was in 
a hurry and wanted to go through the control quickly, the 
customs officials sent the car to the search ramp. The whole 
truth was discovered there. Within minutes, the customs 
officials discovered 19 kg of heroin in the sides of the car. 
  [Unidentified police official] This case is particularly 
interesting. This is a businessman, not a carrier. He is an 
experienced businessman who knows what he is doing; he has large 
economic interests, international connections and has traveled 
the whole world.

  [Text] Naples, Italy, Jan 1 (AFP) -- Police seized more 
than 12 kilogrammes (26 pounds) of heroin worth in excess of 
eight million dollars Sunday after a car chase through Naples. 
  The drugs were seized from an Audi car with Swiss number 
plates after the vehicle was forced to stop at a police 
roadblock in the southern Italian city, local police said. 
  Police said they found the heroin, which was valued at 8.2 
million dollars, in a plastic bag hidden underneath one of the 
rear seats. 
  The chase began after the car failed to stop at a routine 
police checkpoint at an exit off the city's ring road. 
  The driver of the Audi was arrested. Police identified him 
as Istref Salih, 44, adding that they believed him to be a Turk 
and a member of an international drug network based in South 
America. 
  Salih was carrying a passport of a central European country 
at the time of his arrest, police added.

  [Text] Announcer: In Sardinia there is a red 
alert as far as drugs are concerned, particularly in Cagliari, 
where a deadly form of Thai heroin is circulating. Tonino Opes 
reports. 
  Opes: Four victims in two days: Drugs are 
exacting a heavy toll in Sardinia. There are lethal overdoses 
from the killer heroin that has recently begun to arrive from 
Thailand after an absence of ten years. Now it has replaced 
Brown Sugar [previous two words in English] and its effects are 
more devastating. The Cagliari police commissioner, Emilio 
Pazzi, has sounded the alarm. 
  Pazzi: To inject oneself with a dose of Thai 
heroin for those who are used to Brown Sugar, using most 
probably the same dose, means facing almost certain death. 
  Opes: Thai heroin is exceptionally pure and is 
difficult to cut into doses, so drug addicts are running a high 
risk. In Cagliari alone there are over 10,000 drug addicts, but 
the problem concerns the whole island. Unfortunately Sardinia 
has one of the highest rates of AIDS in Italy. 
  Announcer: We have just received the news that the 
killer-heroin has claimed another victim this morning in Sassari 
[Sardinia]. A young man of 32 died after having injected 
himself with a dose of the lethal heroin.

  [Text] Genoa, Italy, Jan 14 (AFP) -- Police Friday [14 
January] said they had arrested 23 Italians, including one who 
made a spectacular break from a U.S. jail, on suspicion of 
running heroin from Turkey and cocaine from Colombia. 
  They were said to be part of a 70-strong gang linked to the 
Mafia in southern Italy and Colombia's Medellin Cartel. 
  Among those arrested was Sicilian Umberto Pitino, 49, who 
was 
detained in 1991 when authorities smashed the so-called "pizza 
connection" in the United States. He escaped by helicopter from 
Raleigh jail in North Carolina with the aid of a Colombian drug 
producer. 
  Police said cocaine totalling 20 kilos (44 pounds) had been 
smuggled from Colombia aboard a ship hidden in musical 
instruments or navigational apparatus.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Martin Bjorklid: "Fewer Overdose Deaths in </F>
Oslo"] 
  [Text] The number of deaths caused by drug abuse has 
decreased sharply in Oslo this year. In Drammen on the other 
hand, the number of such deaths has doubled. 
  So far this year 42 people have been found dead in Oslo from 
overdoses. During all of last year 76 such deaths were recorded. 
There is no clear explanation of this development. The head of 
the overdose team in Oslo, Rolf-Dieter Cron, thinks that the 
increase in drug interdiction during the past year has played no 
part in this positive development. 
<H5>  Fewer Emergencies </H5>
  The police are also hesitant to draw any solid conclusions 
about what impact large drug confiscations have had on the 
availability in the illegal market. 
  The overdose team has had fewer emergency calls than in the 
previous two years. At the same time one has had to give 
antidotes to several people to save their life. Last year about 
60 percent of those who had taken an overdose were given an 
antidote, and this year this has risen to almost 80 percent. 
  "Of the 42 deaths recorded this year we see a trend that 
many 
of these do not belong to the typical inner-city environment. 
Many of these have been visitors. I am now anxious to see if the 
decline in the number of deaths will also take place in other 
large cities like Copenhagen, Bremen, and Stockholm," Cron says. 
  He thinks that if there is no decline in the other cities, 
the overdose team's efforts are an important reason for the 
decline in Oslo. He thinks that the increase in confiscated 
sedatives will also have an impact. Police this year have 
confiscated 30,000 pills compared to about 10,000 last year. 
<H5>  Dramatic in Drammen </H5>
  "We know that the mixture of heroin and sedatives is a 
life-threatening combination. When it is more difficult to 
obtain pills, this situation will have an effect on the number 
of overdoses," Cron says. 
  Drammen has had a tremendous increase in the number of drug 
deaths this past year. So far 21 deaths have been recorded. In 
all of last year the city had 13 such cases. The cities of 
Stavanger and Bergen have also had a higher number of overdoses 
and deaths. Because of the increases there the number of deaths 
in the entire country will probably not decrease this year 
compared to last year. Then a total of 97 deaths were recorded. 
  Police Lieutenant Kristian Sather at Drammen police station 
is quite worried over this development. 
  "It is increasingly younger people who are being recruited 
into the drug scene. Drammen is a burdened city, and we have 
much to fight against." He points out the fact that the police 
alone cannot prevent people from being drawn into the drug scene. 
  "The ambulance service in Drammen has done a great job and 
saved many lives," Sather says.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Damaso and Fernando Semedo: "Drug </F>
Landings With Police Protection"] 
  [Text] Portugal has played the role assigned to it by the 
international drug traffic: that of a gateway to Europe. A 
maritime route, the Portuguese coast has been used 
systematically, for cocaine and hashish trafficking in 
particular. However, this is not a passive participation. The 
major drug trafficking networks, controlled mainly by Galicians, 
but also by Italians and Netherlanders, have their accomplices 
here. Only in this way can their activities succeed. The 
trafficking routes still remain effective, and nothing is left 
to spontaneity or improvisation: The traffickers have human 
accomplices and warehouses; they know roads that bypass 
potential checkpoints; and they have contracts signed for boats 
providing transportation. For months, PUBLICO attempted to 
reconstruct many of those routes, and to assess the Portuguese 
component in this business. The results are surprising. At 
least, it can never again be claimed that Portugal has been 
relegated to a passive role in the international drug traffic. 
  J. works for everyone, provided that they come suitably 
"recommended." From Sito Minanco and Laureano Oubina to Andelo 
Casas, who, two months ago, escaped from the Braga penitentiary 
(he sawed the bars), any Galician drug dealer known on the 
market can use the "passageway" in the central Portuguese city 
where J. is established. With good contacts in the ex-Customs 
Guard [GF] and the Maritime Police, J. prepares for the landings 
after clearing an area adjoining some naval shipyards. The 
"uniformed ones" close their eyes on the sand bar, at their 
posts, and on the surveillance motor boat, also guaranteeing 
"protection" for the landing. Even the guard at the shipyards 
himself closes his eyes, when he is paid a lump sum of 20 contos. 
  However, J. not only guarantees the landing, but also 
provides warehouses for storing hashish and tobacco (cocaine is 
less common, but not excluded from the business). Furthermore, 
he ensures transportation to Spain on light trucks with 
refrigerated bodies. 
  J.'s system is to some extent repeated along the entire 
Portuguese coast. Minho is everyone's territory: a kind of free 
trade zone for the groups that have increased since the 
annihilation of some of the oldest Galician "families" in 
Operation Necora. 
  In the district of Viana do Castelo, all the groups in the 
territory have good contacts. The Viana do Castelo mountain 
ridge, an area controlled by a sergeant from the defunct Customs 
Guard, is a site used as an alternative to other landing points, 
especially Belinhos, in Esposende, when the sea is choppy. 
  In Belinhos, where the GF post was deactivated, the landings 
occur often, because it is considered one of the safest sites on 
the Portuguese coast. Here, too, protection is guaranteed by 
members of the paramilitary forces, who bar the access roads, 
order the movement of vehicles parked in the area (lovers, those 
spying on them, etc.), and monitor the landing operation from a 
distance. 
  The boxes (of hashish, cocaine, and tobacco) are unloaded, 
and then continue their journey on light trucks along municipal 
road 1794, or on other alternative dirt roads adjoining the 
area's small farming establishments. All of this is well 
disguised, and follows strict timetables. 
  The "product" is delivered to the purchaser in Spain, with 
its safe passage guaranteed at the border in Valenca, Moncao, or 
some other border locality where the contacts are more than 
plentiful. 
<H5>  On the Customs Guard Motor Boats </H5>
  One of the most sophisticated systems has been adopted on a 
beach north of Mondego. Next to a shipyard, they unload hashish, 
cocaine, and tobacco that the paramilitary forces' motor boats 
will search for on the so-called "mother ship," at anchor two 
miles from the sand bar. There could be no better protection. 
The system is totally controlled by members of the paramilitary 
forces stationed in the area. 
  PUBLICO is in a position to claim that these incidents 
described are not isolated. The groups guaranteeing the 
reception of drugs and tobacco and their transportation to Spain 
are organized along the Portuguese coast, which is divided into 
areas of influence. 
  Nearly all their members are former maritime smuggling 
bosses 
who have started working for the Spanish purchasers of large 
volumes of hashish and cocaine in Morocco and South America. 
They have vessels at their disposal, cheap labor, warehouses for 
storing the drugs, light trucks for carrying them to Spain, and 
protection given by members of the paramilitary forces: all just 
as it was in the "old" contraband. 
  One of the differences from the past lies in the 
sophistication of the methods. And it is not merely that of 
speedboats, which were all the rage in the late 1980's, but are 
less often used now. 
  On a site located north of Douro, one of the most active 
groups in the landing business has a radar system, installed in 
a residence, which covers a distance of 25 miles. Of course, it 
is accompanied by very powerful communications equipment that 
facilitates the monitoring of the operations on board, also 
affording great accuracy in logging the date, time, and 
conditions of the landing. Once they are on land, the drugs are 
transported to Spain, using a dozen alternate routes. 
<H5>  From Minho to Algarve </H5>
  There are routes and systems leading down from Minho to the 
Alentejo and Algarve coast which, during recent months, have 
been given preference by Spanish and Portuguese drug traffickers 
because they have seas and shores with little surveillance. The 
presence of the Italian "Mafioso," Emilio di Giovinni, in 
Algarve, as well as in southern Spain, between 1991 and 1992, 
prompted an increase in the landings in this area. 
  An importer of hashish and owner of a production farm in 
Morocco, with entry into Italy ensured by contacts that he had 
in Calabria, Giovinni activated the southern part of the 
peninsula, which began acquiring a kind of "new market" in this 
Italian. Up until that time, the Spaniards, some of whom had 
good partners in Portugal, with names that remain a mystery, 
were almost the only large purchasers operating. 
  The Alentejo coast (over 50 km of beaches and small coves 
with few or no visitors and without surveillance) has been in 
great demand by traffickers during recent years. This is, 
moreover, quite obvious in cases reported among the population 
of small fishing communities. 
  In Rogil, a village south of Odeceixe, a fisherman who 
recently committed suicide following an emotional episode had 
several tens of thousands of contos in a bank. This was an 
abnormal situation, considering the income that his occupational 
activity earned him, and the lack of any inheritance. The 
explanation was discovered by the police: he had been retrieving 
packages of hashish and cocaine left at marked fishing floats, 
and later delivering them to a contact in Faro. 
  Early this year, also near Odeceixe, in Azenhas do Mar, a 
fisherman was arrested with 700 grams of hashish in his house. 
The amount of drugs in C.'s possession was not large, but the 
volume of information held by the police on his landing 
activities was considerable. 
  C. was one of the main contacts for recruiting unloaders or 
enlisting boats to receive the product on the high seas, in the 
Odemira area. However, there were also indications of his 
involvement in drug distribution following the temporary 
"storage" of large amounts of hashish and other smaller 
quantities of cocaine, which he was selling directly. A few 
weeks before his arrest, he had offered 20,000 contos in "cold" 
cash to a friend, to give up "that life." Now he is to be tried, 
and will hardly escape a stiff sentence. 
  In the fishing communities of Vila do Bispo, Odeceixe, 
Azenhas do Mar, Milfontes, Porto Covo, and Sines, it is now 
difficult to evade this reality: the landings yield far more 
than fishing does. A local merchant confided: "The gang comes 
here on some winter nights, wearing rubber boots and all bundled 
up; and I know they aren't going fishing." 
  People hereabouts have always made their living from 
smuggling tobacco, "until one day, the boxes began to be 
heavier." This comment was made by a fisherman, indicating the 
shift from tobacco to drugs. Everyone is aware of this, but no 
one is willing to discuss the subject. There are stories without 
names or faces. 
  At one particular juncture, the activity was so appealing, 
enjoying impunity, that some recall "certain incidents" 
involving persons known to them who suffered "accidents" for 
trying to enter the business on their own, in defiance of the 
groups established in the territory for a long time. They cite 
an episode that occurred over five years ago, involving a 
"buddy" who showed up in a deserted area with his legs broken 
and his face "turned into pulp." He reportedly tried to "go it 
alone with the landings." 
  On the Alentejo coast, as in Minho or Algarve, certain small 
fortunes appear and disappear as if miraculously. In some 
localities fortunes, always owned by the same persons, are known 
to have been converted into real estate and land, and lost 
through the vice of card-playing. A few months later, the rumor 
of certain businessmen going bankrupt is dispelled, because they 
begin showing new outward signs of wealth. 
<H5>  Alentejo Summit </H5>
  On the night of 18 August 1992, the heat was stifling, both 
at the Luz Stadium, where the Benfica team was facing Real 
Madrid in a game preparing for the new season, and at the Monte 
Mouro nightclub near Odeceixe. 
  At the stadium, Portuguese and Spanish policemen were 
embroiled in old Iberian soccer rivalries, after a lengthy work 
session to prepare for the seizure of 3 tons of hashish. 
  At the nightclub, a "summit" meeting was being held by 
traffickers attempting to reach an understanding on this 
business of the 3 tons of hashish, owing to problems that arose 
with the contacts for Spain, after the landing. They had to 
determine who was the middleman for that country, and the 
purchaser (there were several interested parties, with different 
middlemen). 
  The drugs ended up not reaching Spain, and were intercepted 
at Vila Verde, following a police operation in which one of the 
traffickers was killed. 
  But this "summit" involved another fundamental issue: the 
reorganization of the maneuvering space for the traffickers "on 
the periphery" of the major groups operating in the area, to 
prevent wars between them. The south, because it had little 
surveillance, would gain ground in comparison with the Minho 
coast, where both the Portuguese and Spaniards had reinforced 
their surveillance. 
  PUBLICO has learned that the penetration of Portugal's air 
space and sea by Spanish police surveillance aircraft and ships, 
because they consider the national patrolling inadequate, is a 
fact known to the Portuguese police authorities. The "aviocars" 
and vessels regularly heading down to the vicinity of the 
Mondego Basin or entering by way of the Algarve coast belong to 
the Customs Surveillance Services. 
  Some results emerged from the "summit" in terms of 
reorganizing the contacts through middlemen between the landing 
groups and the Spanish purchasers. An investigator specializing 
in information gathering told PUBLICO: "It was essential for 
them (the traffickers) to find out who was talking to whom, 
because there was much confusion there, and suspicions between 
them." 
<H5>  The Minho Clan </H5>
  The territory in Minho has belonged to the Viriatos clan. 
Jose Manuel Alonso dos Santos and Antonio Alonso dos Santos are 
two brothers to whom the police have attributed the status of 
the most powerful group in the north moving illicit merchandise. 
It ranges from tobacco to drugs, received in Portuguese waters 
and destined for Spain. 
  Jose Alonso has a permanent residence in La Guardia, and his 
brother, Antonio, in Caminha: houses almost in view of one 
another, although located in different countries. Separating 
them is only the Minho River, an old smugglers' route, every 
bend in which is familiar to the Viriatos brothers. 
  In 1991, however, life did not go well for them. During that 
year, they agreed to work with the Spaniards, Francisco Javier 
Oubina Pinero, Ramon Buballo Martinez, and Jose Constante Pinero 
Bua, all from Cambados, in the Pontevedra district. They 
proposed to import hashish from Morocco. The Viriatos were to 
ensure the transport by sea and the reception, jointly with the 
Spaniard, Jose Casas Andelo. 
  For this purpose they had a trawler, registered in Nazare, 
and owned by Jose Manuel Alonso. Since it had already become 
well known to the authorities for having made other landings, 
particularly of tobacco, its former name of Fe was changed to 
Joi. 
  The business (the continued hashish dealing activity) fared 
badly, because the boat was apparently jinxed. It was damaged on 
several occasions, and ended up being seized with 2,200 kg of 
hashish on the high seas at Vila Real de Santo Antonio. The 
Alonso brothers were arrested and sentenced to 10 years in 
prison. 
  After their capture, other groups emerged in Valenca, 
Moncao, 
Cerveira, and Caminha, ensuring the transportation and 
"protection" of the merchandise on its passage to Spain. They 
have good contacts in the Customs Guard and the Civil Guard in 
Tuy, Porrino, Pontevedra, Valenca, and Moncao. 
  Most of these groups have been engaged in contraband for 
decades, and are familiar with all the historical figures linked 
with this criminal activity in Galicia. Virtually all of them 
find a way of camouflaging their real activities with businesses 
connected to the hotel sector or night life. They have coffee 
shops, bars, and restaurants useful to them for making contacts; 
but also strong logistical support structures, such as light 
trucks, cars with good cylinder capacity, houses, and storage 
places, on both sides of the border. 
  Inside the grounds of one of their houses, PUBLICO saw, on 
one evening, five luxury vehicles, as well as two jeeps and a 
light truck with an open chassis, also a four-wheel drive type. 
We were later able to confirm that all of them belonged to the 
same family. 
<H5>  The Kingdom of Peniche </H5>
  In central Portugal there are several options for landings 
which, as a rule, are controlled by a powerful group in Peniche. 
It has a long-standing complicity (dating from the tobacco 
times) among agents assigned to the local Customs Guard post. 
  According to the DEA (an agency specializing in combating 
the 
drug traffic) report sent to the Spanish police in 1989, Peniche 
had, for many years, been a strategic locality for the Galician 
drug trafficker, Laureano Oubina, and for his presumable 
Portuguese "partner," mentioned in the document, Eduardo Maria 
dos Santos. 
  Owner of Edumar--Shipping Agents, a company that ceased its 
activity in 1991, Eduardo Maria dos Santos is a businessman in 
the fishing sector, with headquarters in Peniche and Lisbon. 
  The U.S. police, and later the Portuguese, identified 
Eduardo 
Maria dos Santos as a representative of Laureano Oubina, and 
Edumar as a kind of support facility for repairs to speedboats 
belonging to the Galician trafficker. The vessels were detected 
in cocaine landings made on the northern coast. 
<H5>  South Divided </H5>
  Southern Portugal is a good example of the country's 
division 
by the Portuguese trafficking groups, and of how they have 
developed their business with the powerful clans of Galicia and 
even in Latin America. The coast extending from Vila Real de 
Santo Antonio to Setubal is controlled by three stronger groups, 
with headquarters in Setubal and Vila do Bispo. They have close 
contacts with other peripheral organizations in Portimao, Faro, 
and Sines. 
  The activity of their principal members has long been 
documented by national and foreign police, given the major 
dimensions of the contacts that they maintain. The latter exist, 
specifically, with the Galician group headed by Laureano Oubina 
(now under arrest in Spain), and with some South American 
cocaine producers. 
  Fishing boats have been operating in the service of the 
three 
groups, with emphasis on a trawler that has had its name changed 
several times. A few years ago, it was registered in Cascais in 
the name of Jose Manuel Viegas. 
  During 1992 alone, the vessel, with the name Estrela do Mar, 
was mentioned in three hashish landings, until its seizure in 
northern Portugal with a shipment totaling several tons. 
  Some of the preeminent figures in the south were mentioned 
in 
prior investigations by the Portuguese and Spanish police, as 
well as the DEA . 
  In 1989, the Americans sent a report to the Spanish police 
identifying Vital Nunes de Carvalho, a former local government 
official in Vila do Bispo, elected by the PCP [Portuguese 
Communist Party], as one of Oubina's contacts in Portugal. 
  At the time, Nunes de Carvalho denied any involvement with 
Spanish drug traffickers or with the former owner of the Estrela 
do Mar, Jose Manuel Viegas, nicknamed "Grego." The latter was 
also a defendant in the contraband proceedings relating to what 
is known as the Setubal Connection. 
  The main defendant in those proceedings was Jose Ribeiro, 
identified as one of the historical figures in contraband, on a 
par with the "Serafins" clan, currently being tried in Aveiro 
for involvement in the network running the tobacco and whiskey 
trade there. 
  Viegas maintains economic interests in Algarve, where he 
owns 
several hotel enterprises, including the hotel at Salema beach 
(he even has a partnership with the Sporting establishment 
president, Sousa Cintra, according to Spanish police documents). 
He was also owner of the vessel, Micheline, seized by the 
Maritime Police in 1979 during an unloading of contraband.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Mercado: "Gonzalez Divides Interior </F>
Ministry Between Asuncion and Garzon"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion 
announced yesterday that Rafael Vera, current secretary of state 
for security, will leave the Ministry at the end of the month, 
and will not fill that post. With the departure of this 
architect of the Socialist antiterrorist policy--he was 
appointed director of state security in 1982--Asuncion holds all 
the reins in the area held by the outgoing official, while 
assigning "all necessary powers" with respect to drug 
trafficking to Baltasar Garzon, [government] representative for 
the National Drug Plan [Office] [PNSD]. This body, Asuncion 
recalled yesterday, has been attached to the Interior Ministry 
"on the government's decision," in accordance with reports 
recommending this allocation submitted by the former judge to 
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez over the past few months. 
  Asuncion said that, apart from some dismissals pending in 
his 
office, the reform of the ministry had been completed with the 
changes formalized yesterday. In addition to Fernando Puig de 
la Bellacasa's inauguration as deputy secretary, there was that 
of Director General of Aliens and Asylum Jaime Axel Ruiz 
Baudrihaye, Director General of Interior Policy Carlos Perez 
Anadon, government representative in Aragon Rafael Garcia de la 
Riva y Sanchiz, and Civil Governor of Castellon Juan Ignacio 
Subias. 
  Vera's departure, which has even been accelerated, according 
to government sources, is a logical consequence of two facts. 
The policy of Asuncion, who as interior minister has toughened 
his language on ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] and has 
emphatically ruled out any negotiation, is at odds with Vera's 
line of constant messages to ETA leaders to achieve a dialogue 
with the terrorist gang. Moreover, Asuncion--although he has 
not publicly mentioned this fact--likes to control all the 
intelligence reins. 
  It was not for nothing that Vera centralized all 
intelligence 
concerning terrorism, and only former Civil Guard Director Luis 
Roldan occasionally bypassed that "filter" and went directly to 
the minister. Judging by this decision, Asuncion did not wish 
to be caught unawares by any subordinate's initiatives to sound 
out ETA leaders, as happened to his predecessor. 
  Second, Garzon's arrival at the Interior Ministry has been 
interpreted as a political slap in the face by not a few top 
officials of that ministry, with whom he has had disputes in 
matters such as the investigation of the Antiterrorist 
Liberation Groups or the dismantling of the Civil Guard's UCIFA 
(Central Antidrug Fiscal Investigation Unit). In addition, 
Garzon comes, as Asuncion said, with "all the powers he needs" 
to combat drug trafficking--previously clearly disparaged police 
tasks of the state secretaryship still headed by Vera, who was 
absent from the ceremony yesterday "because he was on vacation." 
Currently, only Police Director Carlos Conde Duque remains out 
of the previous Interior Ministry leadership team with 
antiterrorist responsibilities. 
  Asuncion pointed out yesterday that the National Drug Plan's 
inclusion in the Interior Ministry is "an aim of the 
government," in light of the reports submitted by Garzon to 
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, with whom the former judge has 
met on several occasions over the past few months. 
  Although Garzon's main task will be drug trafficking, 
Asuncion yesterday made clear his idea of work: "This is a 
team. We will work shoulder to shoulder. I will directly take 
charge of what I must do in all areas, but I will also expect my 
team to take charge of everything." In fact, a very high 
percentage of anticrime activities are connected with drug 
trafficking, and will therefore be overseen by Garzon. 
  Asuncion emphasized that he maintains the same aims as his 
predecessor in charge of the ministry, but stressed that he will 
use different methods. "The ETA prisoners should become more 
involved and should express more openly what they tell us in 
private, and not allow themselves to be manipulated." This idea 
stems from his philosophy that the price of rehabilitation 
should be higher than hitherto, and this could take the form of 
demanding more active cooperation in informing on their former 
comrades, or at least publicly condemning them. The minister 
has even privately shown himself in favor of setting a limit to 
rehabilitation and of ETA members serving their sentences in 
full after a certain point. Asuncion described as forged the 
letters published by EGIN yesterday as having been written by 
ETA prisoners stating that the solution to the conflict "does 
not lie in the prisons." 
  Both Asuncion and Garzon strongly emphasized that the 
National Drug Plan will not relinquish its responsibilities for 
prevention and rehabilitation. 
  One of the most significant novelties of their exposition is 
the government's intention to set up independent central courts 
to combat drug trafficking, with the aim of relieving the 
National High Court of work. The aim of this initiative is for 
those detained for drug trafficking to be tried as quickly as 
possible, since time acts as an enemy in these cases and 
promotes plots to change testimonies and destroy evidence. 
These courts could have jurisdiction over more than one 
community, and only indictments with international or national 
ramifications would come before the National High Court.

<F P=106> ["sda"-signed report: "International Drug Smuggling Ring </F>
Exposed in Switzerland"] 
  [Excerpt] Freiburg, 10 January -- A large-scale 
international drug ring, which sold several kilograms of heroin 
and cocaine, was exposed in Switzerland. Freiburg police 
reported on Monday [10 January] that more than 100 persons were 
arrested in several cantons and are now helping police with 
inquiries. The investigations have been coordinated by the 
Addictive Drugs Section of the Federal Public Prosecutor. 
  The investigations have been going on for 17 months. They 
began with monitoring a Nigerian drug dealer who "directed" a 
branch of the huge international trafficking ring from Freiburg. 
He lived in a hotel and carried out his activities under a 
false name. The man was arrested, together with two other 
persons, in April 1993. He alone will have to stand trial for 
selling more than 20 kilograms of heroin and cocaine.

<F P=106> [Article by Natan Zablotskis, Scientific Research Institute </F>
of the Russia Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs, and 
Dmitriy Oreshkin, Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences: "Another Base for Drug Trade?"] 
  [Text] Russia possesses an enormous potential for drug 
production. Areas occupied by wild hemp and opium poppies 
comprise more than 1 million hectares with a yield of up to 1 
tonne of raw material per hectare. Actually, in Russia the 
number of drug users is increasing more rapidly than the 
population and by the year 2000 will reach 5-7 percent of the 
country's population. 
  At the same time, in the next 10-15 years Russia will not 
play a noticeable role in the import and export of drugs on the 
world market. This is associated primarily with the fact that 
the quality and accordingly the price of drugs traditionally 
mass-produced and used in Russia are considerably lower than in 
Europe or America. Therefore, and also in view of Russia's rapid 
development of economic ties with other countries, Russia is 
being allotted the role of a transshipment base in world drug 
trade. This is also helped by the fact that traditional drug 
transit routes from countries of the "Golden Triangle" (Iran, 
Afghanistan, and Pakistan) and the "Golden Crescent" (Southeast 
Asia), such as the so-called Balkan route, are beginning to be 
controlled successfully by law enforcement agencies. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-TDD-003LC-41A>           Map - Drug Routes </FIG>





    As far as the distribution of drugs within Russia is 
concerned, it is primarily emigres from Azerbaijan who play and 
will play the main role here. In virtually all major industrial 
cities, including in Siberia, and in the Far East, there are 
groups well organized according to the community principle that 
are engaged in the distribution of drugs. On the other hand, an 
active transit of drugs is being accomplished from Afghanistan 
through Tajikistan, and it is not likely that this avenue will 
be taken under strict control in the next few years. 
  Drugs will be transported across the border not over exotic, 
secret paths, but through central international airports under 
the guise of respectable goods produced under the roof of joint 
ventures and even state structures. 
  Zones of special activeness of the "shuttles" are the 
extreme 
west (Lithuania, Latvia, Kaliningrad Oblast) and the extreme 
east (Sakhalin, Primorye). In time, the "southern hub" in the 
republics of the former Soviet Central Asia will increasingly 
make its presence felt.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yuriy Kovalenko: "The West Does </F>
Not Intend To Sacrifice Its Economic Interests in the War on the 
Drugs Trade"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Whenever the battle against drugs comes 
into conflict with the Western countries' economic and 
geostrategic interests, the merciless war declared by their 
governments on dealers in the "white death" fades into the 
background. As a result, the crusade begun by the authorities 
has ended in their total defeat. 
  This is the conclusion reached by Alain Labrousse and Alain 
Vallon, respectively director and coordinator of the 
geopolitical center on narcotics. 
  Following the murder by the Medellin cartel of the main 
candidate for the post of Colombian president in 1989, the 
United States and other Western powers, the authors note, 
announced a campaign on an unprecedented scale against drugs and 
against the laundering of capital obtained from their sale. 
  Four years on, however, drugs production in the world has 
doubled. In the "golden crescent" (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and 
Iran), it has leapt from 800 to 2,200 tonnes. It is growing at 
an even faster pace in the "golden triangle" formed by certain 
regions of Thailand and Burma. Cocaine production in Latin 
America has risen from 800 to 1,500 tonnes. Whereas previously 
only Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru engaged in the drugs trade, now 
the entire continent has become involved in this lucrative 
business. 
  Finally, the former Soviet Central Asian republics are 
becoming an exceptionally important drugs production zone and 
staging post. Alain Labrousse warned me last year that a great 
new drugs power is emerging from the ruins of the land of the 
soviets. It looks as if his prediction is starting to come true. 
  He feels the explanation for the unprecedented drugs boom is 
that the West has no intention of sacrificing its economic 
interests in the war on the "white death." For example, 70 
percent of heroin enters France from Pakistan, several of whose 
ministers have been involved in the drugs business. When 
Francois Mitterrand received the Pakistani premier last year, 
however, he expressed concern about human rights violations but 
said absolutely nothing about heroin. 
  This diplomatic silence brought dividends: In September 
1992, Pakistan signed a contract with Paris to buy three 
submarines worth 3.7 billion francs. 
  The same applies to Burma, which French experts describe as 
the world's main "drugs dictatorship." However, France 
certainly is not inclined to boycott this country, which is a 
major producer of opium and therefore of heroin. The petroleum 
concern Total has signed a contract with the local authorities, 
who are mixed up in the drugs business. If drugs, as Charles 
Pasqua, head of the Interior Ministry, rightly points out, are 
the most terrible scourge in the whole world, why then does 
France not boycott Morocco, which, on the admission of King 
Hassan II himself, has 50,000 hectares of hemp? 
  The French experts describe the United States as the 
"champions of hypocrisy." In order to aid the Nicaraguan 
Contras, the CIA and the famous Colonel North did not simply 
cover up the drugs dealing in which the Contras engaged--they 
actually organized their delivery from Colombia to the United 
States. 
  Afghanistan deserves special attention. When the Soviet 
Union was Washington's main enemy, any method of supporting the 
mujahidin was acceptable. The CIA used the Pakistani special 
services to supply the Afghan rebels with arms. On the return 
journey, the trucks carried opium, which was made into heroin at 
200 underground laboratories in Pakistan. As a result, opium 
production in Afghanistan has risen from 200 tonnes to 3,000 
tonnes in the last 15 years. 
  The West essentially ignores the serious problem of 
laundering money obtained from the sale of drugs. The sum is 
estimated at $300 billion, 90 percent of which is invested in 
industrially developed states. Labrousse warns that Russian and 
Italian drugs dealers are beginning to invest their "gains" in 
the privatization of Russian enterprises. 
  Neither Paris, nor London, nor The Hague is in any hurry to 
close down banks in Bermuda, Gibraltar, and the Caribbean, where 
drugs dollars are kept in total safety. 
  For many "Third World" countries, the only possibility of 
somehow paying for credits lies in the production and sale of 
drugs. The IMF demands that they pursue such a tough economic 
policy that they have no choice but to cultivate poppies and 
hemp or offer their money-laundering services.

Moskovskiy and Frunzenskiy Rayon task forces have detained four 
drug dealers doing a brisk trade in a prohibited substance. 
  Thanks to a skilfully planned operation, the underground 
dealers were arrested with incontrovertible evidence--while they 
were trying to sell over 20 kg of poppy haulms [makovaya 
solomka]. 
  A resident of Pskov Oblast, a native of Chechnya, was also 
caught on Kolomenskaya Street. Some 17 kg of plant raw 
materials for the production of drugs were confiscated from this 
drug baron. Criminal proceedings have been instituted.

<F P=106> [Report by Stepan Panayotov: "In the Immediate Future, the </F>
South of Ukraine Can Become the Biggest Producer of Marijuana 
and Hashish"] 
  [Text] While collective farms were harvesting wheat, 
agents from the department for illegal drug dealing at the 
Kherson Oblast Internal Affairs Administration had their hands 
full collecting other kinds of "crops." They discovered 24 
fields of hashish varieties of hemp. The plants were sown on 
areas ranging from 100 square meters to 3.6 hectares. Over the 
past nine months, 127 kg of poppy, 19 kg of marijuana, and more 
than 3 kg of opium extract were confiscated. In underground 
laboratories, it would be processed into the ready-to-use heroin. 
  Sergey Poltavskiy, the department chief, made the following 
comment: "Kherson Oblast is one of the few oblasts in southern 
Ukraine whose climate and soil are suitable for Indian and 
southern Chu hemp. And these plants serve as raw material for 
such deadly narcotics as hashish, marijuana, and anasha." 
  The number of illegal hemp fields in Kherson Oblast is 
continuing to grow. In some cases, when the fields were left 
unattended for several years, plants grew and proliferated 
extremely well. This means that Indian and Chu hemp can adjust 
to the local environment and proliferate without help of man. 
  This happened before. Let us just recall the notorious Chu 
Valley in Kazakhstan. Once seeds of the Indian hemp found their 
way to that area, they immediately spread over tens of square 
kilometers, turning it into a paradise for drug traffickers. Is 
there a perspective of another Chu Valley looming ahead? 
Unfortunately, the answer is "yes." 
  It is extremely hard to detect illegal fields. In many cases 
they can only be spotted from a helicopter. Plants are hidden 
between the rows of corn on the corn fields, in plantations of 
young trees, or in the rush thicket, reached only by water. 
  The militia forces are too understaffed and underequipped to 
conduct a large scale combing. In the past, forestry officers 
and road builders used to help the enforcement agencies, 
uprooting man-made plantations and wild hemp. They even had to 
make special reports on this. Now, no one has to do anything. 
The hemp has been left alone. There is nothing to prevent it 
from spreading to new areas. A package of antidrug laws 
imposing heavy fines on managers turning a blind eye on hemp in 
their businesses is stuck somewhere in the vast reaches of the 
Supreme Council. Will it surface at least before the next "hemp 
sowing campaign?"

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on drug seizures and arrests related to drug trafficking 
monitored through 13 January. 
<H5>  Bolivia </H5>
  During a 6 January operation at Potosi's bus station, the 
Special Antinarcotics Force seized 4.4 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride hidden in a parcel sent from Cochabamba and 
arrested an unidentified citizen. (La Paz Radio Fides in Spanish 
1100 GMT 7 Jan 94) 
  Narcotics police reported that on 1 January they confiscated 
8.95 kg of cocaine hydrochloride from a briefcase on board a TAM 
flight in El Trompillo airport. It was destined for 
Riberalta-Guayamerin. Police arrested Adolfo Salas Arteaga for 
questioning. Police also reported that 10.28 kg of cocaine were 
confiscated by a patrol in Santa Ana de Yacuma that also 
arrested two men and a woman in the case. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 
in Spanish 4 Jan 94 p 13) 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  Amazonas Drug Control Precinct personnel on 6 January burned 
2,000 coca plants in an abandoned ranch in Puraquequara, 25 km 
from Manaus. Police also found a cocaine-processing laboratory. 
(Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 7 Jan 94 p 8) 
  Narcotics Department police on 9 January confiscated 45 kg 
of 
cocaine in Ourinhos and arrested four people charged with 
supplying drugs to the "Nigerian Connection." They are: Ramao 
Rodrigues da Silva, 29; Jose Carlos Silverio, 34; Marco Antonio 
Leandro Daniel, 47; and Izete Moreira da Silva, 44. The cocaine 
came from Bolivia to Corumba and from there by airplane to 
Ourinhos. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 11 Jan 94 
p 3) 
<H5>  Chile </H5>
  On 17 December 1993, Investigative Police arrested Colombian 
Eduardo Orozco Prada, 54. Orozco, who was linked to drug 
trafficking, is wanted by the Italian courts, which had 
sentenced him to 19 years of imprisonment. He is charged with 
transferring $6.4 million to accounts controlled by the Cali 
cartel in Swiss banks. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 22 Dec 
93 p C13) 
  The Investigative Police Anti-Narcotics Brigade arrested 
three members of the La Legua cartel. They are Manuel Fuentes 
Cancino, 44, aka El Perilla, who is the alleged leader of the 
group; Matias Godoy, 39; and Ricardo Perez, 45, aka El Chupete. 
Police also seized more than 750 grams of cocaine hydrochloride 
in their possession. (Santiago LA TERCERA DE LA HORA in Spanish 
23 Dec 93 p 30) 
  The Investigative Police Anti-Narcotics Brigade seized 251 
kg 
of cocaine and dismantled major drug rings during 417 operations 
in Arica in 1993. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 29 Dec 93 p

A10) 
  The National Police Antinarcotics Division reported that 600 
metric tons of washed cocaine paste were processed in the 
Peruvian coca-growing area in 1993, but only 1 percent was 
seized. It says logistical and financial support for drug 
enforcement in Upper Huallaga and the Peruvian central jungle 
are insufficient. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 3 Jan 94 p A8) 
  The National Antidrug Directorate seized more drugs in Upper 
Huallaga in 1993: 8,301 kg of drugs, 88,121 kg of precursors, 
three light airplanes, and 48 vehicles. It destroyed 38 cocaine 
processing laboratories, two light airplanes, and 15 maceration 
pits from January to October 1993. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish

  [Text] [Paraguayan] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy arrived 
in Buenos Aires this morning. He will probably propose an 
association of Southern Cone governments, in what could be 
called the resurgence of the "Condor Operation," to fight 
eventual subversive outbursts similar to that provoked by the 
Zapatista movement in Chiapas, Mexico. 
  Argentine media sources commented on a meeting between 
[Argentine President] Carlos Menem, [Uruguayan President] Luis 
Alberto Lacalle, and Wasmosy in Punta del Este last weekend, 
during which the presidents reportedly expressed concern for the 
possible entry, through the Bolivian and Paraguayan borders, of 
alleged guerrillas who would attempt to destabilize local 
governments. 
  Asked about the subject shortly before leaving for Buenos 
Aires, Wasmosy denied that the issue had been discussed during 
the Punta del Este meeting. He said, however, that the matter 
could possibly be raised this time around, adding that if this 
were the case he would propose the association of the three 
countries' armies and intelligence services. Asked about his 
government's proposal if the issue of guerrilla activities were 
discussed at the mini-summit, Wasmosy said: "An association. 
Let us hope all countries will join efforts--armies as well--to 
fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and crime in general. 
That is the objective. We had a meeting of general staff 
chiefs to discuss the matter recently. I think we have made 
progress."

  [Text] Alberto Lestelle, programming and coordination 
secretary for the prevention of drug abuse and for narcotics 
struggle, has admitted that Argentina is the drug "trafficking 
route" and that "drug money is laundered, although not in the 
same volume as in such places as Switzerland and the United 
States." 
  Lestelle said that "there is a lot of money behind drugs" 
and 
there are interests "in the political and journalistic 
structures, and in the security and justice organizations." 
  He added that following the death of Colombian trafficker 
and 
leader of the Medellin Cartel, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, it is 
possible that the drug mafias "will try to reorganize their 
cadres in the southern part of the continent," maybe in 
Brazil--"because of the political instability"--in Bolivia, and 
in Paraguay. 
  "Escobar's death was a spectacular victory for the Colombian 
government, but it is not the solution to the problem. The 
conflict may be intensified because the Medellin Cartel, 
besieged by the authorities and by the Cali Cartel, will try to 
reorganize itself," he added. 
  "Drug traffickers are everywhere, and except for the effort 
made by the governments of Argentina, Peru, and Colombia to 
eliminate them, they can operate because of the volume of money 
they handle," LA PRENSA reported in a note published today. 
  Lestelle said: "Relations between traffickers and guerrillas 
are not by chance because the former produces while the latter 
protects what the former produces, providing security--like in 
Peru or Colombia--in exchange for money." 
  Lestelle admitted that his organization "is not competent in 
fine intelligence work" and voiced his desire for the "creation 
of an organization to coordinate the intelligence organizations." 
  He concluded by saying: "The National Intelligence Center, 
to 
a certain extent, compensates for the absence of that 
organization although I am not aware of the success or failure 
of its performance because it is handled by the Secretariat for 
State Intelligence (SIDE)."

  [Text] As a result of negotiations with the government, the 
coca growers of Chapare and Yungas will be able to sell their 
products in the nine departments of the country, said Guido 
Tarqui, leader of the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation], who 
participated in the negotiations. 
  He said that this agreement breaks the circle around the 
coca 
market. He added: "It will now be possible to take the 
products from the central markets to the different departments 
of greater consumption. This will help consumers because prices 
will fall." 
  He also said that branch markets will be established to 
allow 
producers to take the coca there directly. He said: "This will 
not affect middlemen, it will only serve to open up free 
marketing in the different parts of the country." 
  Tarqui indicated that during the meeting held on 6 January 
important progress was made in favor of coca growers, but that 
there are still several points pending on which the government 
must provide answers to the COB by 25 January, so that both 
sides can study them together on 3 February. 
  He said: "The regulation for marketing coca was approved, 
although some additions based on agreements for the Chapare 
region of Cochabamba must still be made. The only thing left to 
be done now is to promulgate the law based on the agreements 
reached with the government minister (German Quiroga)." 
  He added that another important point of progress was the 
government's full acceptance of the issuance of a supreme decree 
for marketing coca. 
  Regarding the pending points, Tarqui said that the 
government 
asked that the revision of Law 1008 on controlled substances, 
which coca growers have demanded be made permanent, be left 
pending. 
  Tarqui recalled that as a result of Law 1008 many peasants 
were subjected to abuse and attacks "because coca and cocaine 
are in the same bag." 
  He said that the decree on the participation of peasants is 
also pending. 
  Decree 22270 establishes the "equal" participation of 
peasants and officials of the National Committee for Alternative 
Development (Conadal), the Regional Committee for Alternative 
Development (Coredal), and the Local Alternative Development 
Committees (Colodal). 
  Tarui added: "We are demanding that equal participation in 
this case be maintained. That is, five government 
representatives, five peasant representatives, and one official 
who in this case would be the government minister."

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Alves Filho: "Olive Green Belt"; </F>
introductory paragraph in boldface as published] 
  [Text] The Army and the Military Police are occupying 
the Roquete Pinto shantytown in a pilot operation to combat drug 
trafficking in Rio de Janeiro. 
  The offensive began on 11 October. A gunfight between rival 
gangs in the Roquete Pinto shantytown in Rio de Janeiro's 
Northern Zone resulted in shots being fired at the Army's 24th 
Armored Infantry Battalion and wounding a sentinel. In response, 
the military unleashed a major operation in cooperation with 
Federal, Military, and Civil Police to get rid of the 
traffickers controlling day-to-day life in the neighborhood. The 
assault resulted in one dead and eight wounded, with 28 suspects 
ending up in jail--and it should have ended there. It should 
have, but it did not. Since then, Army soldiers and officers 
have taken charge of the fight against drug trafficking in the 
shantytown as part of what is considered a pilot project that 
may be extended to other parts of the city. Without fanfare, the 
military occupation of Rio de Janeiro's shantytowns has begun. 
  "The Roquete Pinto shantytown has become a training camp and 
school for soldiers of the Armed Forces," explains Colonel Paulo 
Cesar Costa de Oliveira of the Rio de Janeiro Military Police, 
who has been appointed to coordinate the joint operation by 
state police and the Army. "Once the work in that locality is 
well established, I am going to ask that they occupy the Vigario 
Geral and Parada de Lucas shantytowns." So far, the objectives 
of the operation have been achieved. The traffickers have been 
routed, the shantytown mapped out, and the residents registered. 
But perhaps the chief success has been the trust instilled in 
the residents by the military. "The atmosphere here has changed 
from water to wine; things are calm," swears Denilson de Melo, 
19, who has headed the local residents association since the 
president-elect, Gilberto Silva, was arrested a month ago on 
charges of helping the traffickers. "Now on hot days, I can 
sleep in the flagstone courtyard at my house, which used to be 
occupied by `fireworks kids' (boys who set off fireworks to 
alert traffickers to the arrival of police or a shipment of 
drugs)." Melo believes that the entire Roquete Pinto community 
gives the action by the federal troops its unconditional support. 
  Upon taking charge of policing the area, the Army's first 
step was to map all the alleys and side streets in Roquete Pinto 
and assign numbers to them. It then began registering the 
residents. Using its prerogative under the Constitution, the 
Army relieved the state police of their duty to combat 
trafficking in the region and began making two daily incursions 
into the shantytown. The last step was to close off access by 
sea, since Roquete Pinto is located on the shores of Guanabara 
Bay. The process of issuing identification papers to fishermen 
will be completed within a few days, after which only those 
living in the locality will be allowed to enter. The entire 
operation has the support of the Special Service, whose agents 
have infiltrated the shantytown to provide information. 
  From the children to the older residents, everyone has only 
praise for the soldiers. "For the first few days, people were 
afraid, thinking that this might become a military stronghold, 
but it was the opposite that happened," says Severina Santos, 
45, who owns a bar in the shantytown. "Now we can move about in 
the streets at any hour without being afraid that bad things 
will happen to us," she adds with an air of satisfaction. The 
"bad things" to which Severina is referring are not limited 
solely to crimes committed by the traffickers: they also include 
arbitrary acts by military police officers from the 16th 
Battalion, who were previously responsible for patrolling the 
area. "They are hated by the community because they were in the 
habit of assaulting innocent workers and invading the shacks of 
honest people instead of pursuing criminals," says the president 
of the residents association. 
  According to Melo, one reason why the shantytown residents 
support the Army's action is precisely that it has eliminated 
the control that PM [Military Police] soldiers used to exercise 
over the residents. Even the children agree. "The police were 
always beating us up for no reason, saying that we were acting 
as runners (delivering drugs), and one time one of them took my 
bicycle," commented eight-year-old L. To establish closer 
relations with the residents, the 24th Armored Infantry 
Battalion has stepped up the medical care that it has been 
providing at the Community Center for the past two years. That 
center is now being used as a kind of base for the troops in the 
shantytown. "I hope they never leave here," says the president 
of the residents association. 
  As a result of the increase in crime in Rio de Janeiro, and 
especially since the slaughter in the Vigario Geral shantytown, 
the idea of making federal troops responsible for policing the 
state has brought the Left and the Right together in a 
surprising consensus. On the day following the massacre, Federal 
Deputy Sergio Arouca (PPS [Popular Socialist Party], Rio de 
Janeiro), who was once a member of the Brazilian Communist 
Party, took the floor in the Chamber of Deputies to demand 
federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro's Military Police, 
although he does not support an isolated action like that in the 
Roquete Pinto shantytown. In a newspaper article, sociologist 
Herbert de Souza ("Betinho") appealed to Governor Leonel Brizola 
(PDT [Democratic Labor Party]) to request the "immediate and 
urgent cooperation of the Armed Forces." Even Mayor Cesar Maia 
(PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]) endorsed the idea. 
  Those appeals did not surprise Army commanders. In a 
document 
drawn up by the War College [ESG] in 1989 and titled "Structure 
of National Power for the Year 2000," such a situation had 
already been foreseen by the formulators of military strategies. 
The document predicted that "at the start of the coming 
century," a "contingent of dropouts, criminals, and even 
murderers" would be harassing the state police forces to such an 
extent that the latter would "ask the Armed Forces to help by 
taking over the tough task of confronting that horde of outlaws, 
neutralizing them, and even destroying them so that law and 
order can be maintained." 
  Although total disorder was not expected until the year 
2000, 
members of the Army High Command began in mid-1992 to draw up a 
plan for occupying Rio de Janeiro's shantytowns, calling it 
Operation "Diamond." The plan was even tested in brief and 
secret exercises conducted in cooperation with the Military 
Police, but the possibility of its actually being put into 
effect was repeatedly denied by military authorities. But in 
October, Operation "Diamond" did indeed take effect. Without any 
fanfare, the Army has stopped drug trafficking in the Roquete 
Pinto shantytown, and its action may be extended to other 
localities. The Armed Forces have their sights set chiefly on 
Borel Hill, whereas the Military Police would prefer to have 
military help in Vigario Geral and Parada de Lucas. 
  Although the commanding officer of the 24th Armored Infantry 
Battalion declines to discuss the Army's situation in the 
Roquete Pinto shantytown, the unit's deputy commanding officer, 
Lieutenant Colonel Themistocles Leao Filho, has written an 
article on the subject for the next issue of OMBRO A OMBRO, a 
newspaper aimed at military readers. In his article, Leao 
criticizes officers who supported more vigorous action in the 
shantytown after the traffickers fired at the barracks. "Some 
comrades have been heaping severe criticism on us for not 
sending in armored units and firing away until not one stone was 
left on top of another," the lieutenant colonel comments. "Once 
again, without getting carried away and without heroics or 
insane actions, the mission was accomplished and is being 
accomplished," he says. "Since that time, we have been in the 
shantytown registering people, supporting them, and patrolling 
the area." 
  Unconcerned with the ESG's strategic theories, the residents 
of Roquete Pinto are again experiencing peace. The soccer fields 
once used by rival gangs of traffickers are again being visited 
regularly by children. The troops no longer frighten 
anyone--quite the contrary. The soldiers are winning fans in the 
shantytown. "They are cute," says Marcia Ribeiro, 16.

  [Text] At least 12 people were killed during a war between 
two gangs for the control of drug trafficking at the Acari and 
Jorge Turco shantytowns before daybreak yesterday. Two pregnant 
women and two minors were among the dead. 
  A morning of terror began in Acari. Some 30 traffickers 
headed by (Parazao), armed with machine guns and grenades, 
invaded the Acari shantytown and assassinated four individuals 
at point blank range. 
  (Parazao's) men then moved to the Jorge Turco shantytown, in 
Rocha Miranda. Eight more were killed during the ensuing clash.

  [Text] Demetrio Limoniel Chavez, alias El Vaticano, the 
Peruvian version of Pablo Escobar, was arrested this morning in 
Cali. El Vaticano was accompanied by Juan Carlos Orejuela, a 
Colombian who has been accused of using illegal means to build 
his fortune. Chavez and Orejuela will be transferred in the 
next hours to Santa Fe de Bogota. Here is a report by Ximena 
Cardoza: 
  [Begin Cardoza recording] Demetrio Limoniel Chavez 
Penaherrera, alias El Vaticano, Peru's leading drug trafficker, 
was arrested in Cali in the early hours of 13 January. The 
arrest took place during a police raid in the neighborhood of 
Los Arrayanes located in northern Cali. At the time of the 
raid, Chavez was accompanied by Colombian capo Juan Carlos 
Orejuela, and had $60,000 in his possession. 
  Currently, an operation by the Cali police investigative 
team 
is under way to transfer Chavez to Santa Fe de Bogota. The 
police have denied access to the media and await an order from 
the Prosecutor General's Office to transfer Chavez to the Marco 
Fidel Suarez Air Force Base. Seemingly, Chavez was imprisoned 
in Peru, but was released for unknown reasons. Chavez has been 
turned over to the Colombian Prosecutor General's Office. [end

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- General Jairo Rodriguez, 
deputy director of the judicial and general investigations 
police, has disclosed that Peruvian drug trafficking boss 
Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, alias El Vaticano, 
captured in Colombia and deported to Lima last night, had 
entered this country clandestinely through the Amazon jungle. 
  Rodriguez said Chavez Penaherrera had been hiding in Cali 
for 
a year. He added that the Peruvian drug trafficker did not 
resist arrest. He had no documents and offered the Colombian 
policemen $1 million to let him go. 
  According to Peruvian authorities, Chavez Penaherrera is 
wanted for crimes against the public faith [fe], falsification 
of airplane licenses and flags to the detriment of the Peruvian 
state, crimes against public health, and narcotics trafficking, 
specifically shipping approximately 60,000 kg of cocaine paste 
from Peru to Colombia.

  [Text] The Cali Cartel is as powerful in Peru as it is in 
Colombia. According to intelligence reports, the organization 
operates by bribing the authorities who try to fight them. The 
very few who have dared to report on them are journalists. 
  Myriam Ortiz brings us a report, done with the cooperation 
of 
Peru's Channel 9: 
  [Begin Ortiz recording] According to authorities, the 
so-called Cali Cartel also has a well-structured organization in 
Peru known as Los Calenos. 
  Waldo Vargas, alias El Ministro, is considered the main 
leader. He purchases drugs worth $144 million every year. 
Vargas, born in Colombia, is the lord and master of the Bajo 
Huallaga area. He has gone as far as using Peruvian Air Force 
helicopters to transport drugs, according to information given 
to the general command. 
  Demetrio Limoniel Chavez, also known as El Vaticano, is the 
other leader of the organization. It is estimated that he buys 
$216 million worth of drugs every year. El Vaticano works with 
his brother Humberto, also known as Calavera, who manages the 
landing strips, but his main storage center is in Palma Pampa, 
Ayacucho, from where the flights leave for Colombia. 
  Berta Chavez, also known as La Calena, is El Vaticano's 
sister, and she markets 5 tons of coca paste each month. She 
was arrested in September 1993, but a judge released her 
recently. 
  (Luis Hernan Pineda Menjura), also known as Trompa de Buque, 
and La Calena were in charge of a shipment landing strip and 
this laboratory uncovered by police. 
  Everything seems to indicate that this cartel's strategy is 
to buy the authorities in charge of fighting drug traffic. For 
this reason, they operate as if they were in their own homes, 
and the cases of corruption become more evident everyday. 
  Major (Enrique Paez), former commander of the Zaposoa Base, 
has admitted he allowed drug flights to come in, while Maj. 
Alfredo Ruiz, former commander of (Duchisa), was caught when he 
was authorizing the shipment of a cargo of coca paste to 
Colombia. 
  The military does not like the journalists' research. Some 
have been murdered; others have received death threats. [end

  [Text] Barranquilla (Colombia), 13 Jan (EFE) -- The 
Administrative Department of Security (DAS) reported that Puerto 
Rican drug trafficker Fernando Montanes Buitron, who escaped 
from a Puerto Rican jail in 1991 and whose extradition has been 
requested by the United States, was arrested in Barranquilla 
(northern Colombia) today. 
  Emilio Vence, DAS chief in Barranquilla (capital city of 
Atlantico Department,) added that Montanes, who had been serving 
a 24-year sentence in a Puerto Rican jail when he escaped, was 
arrested in a house located in the northern area of this 
Colombian Caribbean city. 
  Montanes was sent to prison in 1981, but 10 years later in 
January 1991, he and two other prisoners escaped in a 
helicopter. According to Vence, "he apparently has been working 
in Colombia doing the same thing he did in Puerto Rico." 
  The official added that Montanes will be transferred to 
Santa 
Fe de Bogota and will remain under strict security measures, at 
the orders of the Office of the Prosecutor General of the 
Republic, while his possible extradition to Puerto Rico or the 
United States is being processed. 
  On Wednesday [12 January], DAS also arrested Peruvian 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, alias "El Vaticano," in Cali 
(southeastern Colombia). Peru had requested Chavez' extradition. 
He is charged with trafficking 60 tons of coca paste to Colombia.

  [Text] The announcement that the Search Bloc has arrived in 
Valle del Cauca has upset Tulua Mayor Gustavo Alvarez who said 
nobody requested permission from him to house the Search Bloc 
members in that city's police academy. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mayor Alvarez, 
what 
have you learned about the presence of the Search Bloc here in 
Tulua? 
  [Alvarez] I have no official information on that. Neither 
the national government authorities nor the police authorities 
have notified me that the Search Bloc members will be housed in 
the Simon Bolivar Academy. However, I heard that report in a 
Voice of America broadcast and I read it on the front page of 
today's edition of OCCIDENTE. 
  [Reporter] What does the Search Bloc's arrival represent for 
the residents of Tulua? 
  [Alvarez] As city mayor, I will accept it. However, as a 
resident of Valle del Cauca, I am truly sorry. I have said that 
the Search Bloc in Valle del Cauca is following the orders of 
the U.S. ambassador and State Department officials. Just two 
days after Pablo Escobar was killed, they said that a war had to 
be waged in Valle del Cauca. I do not think Valle del Cauca 
needs a war, and I think it can follow the law through 
reasonable means, through a dialogue, and seek solutions so that 
there will be no war here. [end recording]

  [Text] The British foreign minister has arrived in 
Colombia, and he has very good plans. Not only will he sign a 
document with President Gaviria that guarantees oil exploration, 
but he is also offering assistance for strengthening the oil 
fields area. In addition, he is willing to promote British 
investments in our country. 
  The visit to Colombia by Foreign Minister [title as heard] 
David Heathcoat is marked by an interest in the Cusiana oil 
fields. The British official says he favors investments in oil 
exploration and marketing by other British companies. 
  [Begin Heathcoat recording in English, fading into Spanish 
translation] Yes, we are going to talk about petroleum as a part 
of progress, investment, and trade. The British Petroleum 
Company is investing in petroleum development in Cusiana and 
(Cupiaya). I want to urge other British firms to invest in the 
country. [end recording] 
  Foreign Minister Heathcoat offered to the Colombian 
prosecutor general continued cooperation in the struggle against 
drug trafficking. Therefore, more fingerprint identification 
equipment and vehicles will be arriving in the country, and the 
Colombian personnel in charge of this task will be provided more 
technical training. 
  At this time the foreign minister is meeting with President 
Gaviria. They will sign the documents on oil investment and oil 
fields security. Exports to Colombia will increase considerably 
during the year. In other words, the British like investing in 
Colombia very much.

  [Text] The remains of at least 60 human beings were found 
today in a mass grave in Landazuri Municipality, Santander 
Department. It is believed that the corpses have been there 
anywhere between two to five years. 
  There is already speculation as to why they are there. Some 
versions say it is the result of accounts settled among poppy 
growers. Others say the deaths were due to executions by 
guerrillas. 
  Amid five hectares of poppy plantations in the place known 
as 
El Roble Heights, in Landazuri Municipality in Santander 
Department, troops of the Rafael Reyes Infantry Battalion found 
a mass grave with the remains of at least 60 people buried some 
time within the past five years. According to the Army, they 
are all FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] 
guerrillas, and many of the victims have bullet wounds. 
  The "National Newscast" has learned that apparently the 60 
murdered guerrillas could be the result of executions among the 
rebels because of disloyalty. The executions may have been 
ordered by Braulio Herrera, former representative to the chamber 
by the UP [Patriotic Union], when he was the fourth-ranking FARC 
commander. 
  For this deed, the former congressman was sentenced to death 
by the guerrilla command, but he was able to leave the country 
illegally. 
  However, the authorities of the Landazuri municipality 
believe the corpses found there could be the result of a war 
among poppy growers of the region. 
  In the town today there is an atmosphere of mourning and 
anxiety because never before had such serious deeds been 
registered in the jurisdiction.

<F P=106> [Report by Nelly Gomez in Barranquilla; from the "NTC News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The U.S. airplanes that overflew Barranquilla 
yesterday are participating in narcotics operations with the 
national government's authorization. What is unclear is why 
they flew so close to the ground when their route was authorized 
by the Colombian Air Force at 22,000 feet. 
  The two U.S. military airplanes overflew Barranquilla for 
eight hours and endangered air navigation in Colombia, according 
to Henry Jimenez, supervisor of the Ernesto Cortizos Airport 
control tower. The pilots never reported their position or 
altitude; all they did was identify themselves with the names of 
Cajun 680 Alpha and Cajun 57 Alpha. 
  [Begin Jimenez recording] They never answered our calls. 
That is why they might have caused a collision with controlled 
civilian aircraft. No one could tell what were the aircraft's 
positions or altitude at a given moment. [end recording] 
  According to the official, the U.S. aircraft were in a 
critical airspace coordinate, meaning a route designated for 
civilian aircraft on the Barranquilla-Santa Fe de Bogota-New 
York route, crossing through Curazao and vice versa. 
  The military aircraft left for Howard Air Force Base, 
Panama, 
at 1900.

  [Text] An operation was executed this week in Rio Blanco, 
southern Tolima Department, presumably with the participation of 
DEA members. Witnesses say six helicopters landed with troops, 
while two small airplanes overflew the zone. 
  The helicopters landed, one by one, and deposited troops in 
the village. Certain residences were later raided. Aircraft 
also overflew the area, and helicopters landed in Gaitan, a 
poppy and guerrilla forces center located two hours from Rio 
Blanco. 
  [Begin Hernando Cardenas recording] It has been confirmed 
that people's money has been seized. It is known that one 
person's 10 million pesos were taken. [end recording] 
  People living in this zone of Tolima Department say the 
country's authorities are doing the right thing when they 
provide protection, but they wonder: Why was such an impressive 
operation launched? Why did the operation include foreign 
personnel? 
  [Begin recording] [Father Ivan Rodriguez] I saw helicopters 
flying overhead. It is true, there were some foreigners. 
  [Jesus Valbuena] The commanders were people who spoke very 
little, and they were heard speaking some words in English. [end

  The residents of Rio Blanco are used to many difficult

  [Text] Bogota, 15 Jan (DPA) -- Several radio stations 
today reported that two airplanes, apparently belonging to the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), flew over Colombia's 
Caribbean area for several hours. 
  The airplanes began flying at low altitudes over the cities 
of Barranquilla and Cartagena at approximately 0900 (1400 GMT) 
and after noon they were still flying. 
  Up until late afternoon no Colombian authority had reported 
any reasons for the flights, which caused concern among 
residents of these Caribbean cities, which are visited by large 
numbers of tourists. 
  Unofficial sources have informed DPA that within the next 
few 
hours the government of Cesar Gaviria will release an official 
statement explaining the presence of the airplanes in Colombia's 
air space. 
  It seems as if the airplanes are conducting routine flights 
between several bases, within the framework of agreements signed 
between Colombia and the United States to wage war on 
drug-trafficking gangs. 
  This situation has emerged at a time when Colombia is facing 
a huge controversy over the presence of U.S. troops who are 
working on various fronts. 
  The most controversial case has been reported in the western 
town of Juanchaco, where U.S. troops are building a school, 
health center, and highway, to which several political sectors 
are opposed. 
  Detractors say the foreign troops are taking advantage of 
their stay in Colombia to conduct intelligence tasks and other 
unclear activities that violate Colombia's sovereignty. 
  Gaviria's government has insisted that the U.S. aid is legal 
and a noble gesture, because the projects they are carrying out 
are for the benefit of the country's poor sectors.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Excerpts] Following a charge implying the existence of 
appalling deals between federal agents and drug traffickers, the 
residents of the Indian communities in Juarez Valley have chosen 
to remain silent because of their fear. 
  "This is a very critical matter that is being treated 
superficially.... I refuse to say anything": That comment was 
made by the Zaragoza community commissioner, Porfirio Silva, 
who, six months ago, publicly charged that "in the region it was 
easier to obtain a kilo of marijuana than one of tortillas." 
  The movement of drugs (claimed in the accusation as 
occurring 
in most of the 17 Indian communities comprising the valley) is 
an activity not confirmed thus far by any evidence gathered by 
Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents during their raids in that 
area. 
  In its crackdown on the drug traffic, the department has not 
managed to seize marijuana or cocaine shipments after several 
raids reported to have taken place since July. 
  Those negative statistics represent a strong motivation for 
the community residents, from Zaragoza to Guadalupe, not to opt 
for making any new charges regarding such activity. 
  However, State Judicial Police [PJE] officials and municipal 
employees operating in those municipalities have also been 
remiss in issuing any further reports. 
  For example, the state agents have not repeated their 
intervention in any operation, nor reported any unusual movement 
on trails or in settlements since August, when one of their 
fellow officers was captured by PJF members. 
  "Since then, there has never been any kind of cooperation; 
and, besides, we represent an agency dealing with common crimes. 
We have devoted ourselves to that alone," declared the PJE 
commander in Guadalupe, Octavio Frescas. 
  The federal police arrested one of his agents in August, 
accusing him of having protected the landing of a small plane 
presumably loaded with drugs: something that could never be 
proven. [passage omitted] 
  According to the town hall secretary, Eduardo Ramos, 
Guadalupe, regarded for years as one of the municipalities used 
by drug traffickers for landing their planes, is, nevertheless, 
a safe place now. 
  "It is so peaceful here that we do not even know the federal 
police," he remarked. [passage omitted] 
  The commissioner of the Juarez Reforma Indian community, 
Jesus Olivo, who resides in the village of Caseta, a site 
notorious for drug trafficking, even asserted: "Movements of 
that type have never occurred here." 
  Another community representative, Antonio Flores, from San 
Isidro, also claimed that the drug traffic in the region "is a 
thing of the past," although he was among those who witnessed, 
and did not deny, the public charge submitted to Mayor Francisco 
Villareal. 
  Described by Silva as a region "serving as a springboard for 
drugs," Juarez Valley was explored by PJF agents weeks later, 
after the mayor had met with the PGR [Attorney General of the 
Republic] representative, Teresa Jardi Alonso, according to 
reports issued at the time. 
  The agents' invasion was announced in August by the 
assistant 
representative of the Attorney General's Office, Samuel 
Terrazas. However, no results have been reported from the 
maneuvers to date. 
  At the PJE office in Guadalupe, Commander Frescas indicated 
that, throughout their tours, countless trails and settlements 
"known in their entirety only to the natives" were detected. 
  He added: "There are very long and varied trails, but it 
cannot be claimed that they are being used by `narcos.'" 
  According to the residents themselves, the PGR helicopter 
flights have been intensified in that area during the past few 
days. Nevertheless, there has been no report to date of the 
discovery of landing strips, trails, or drug seizures involving 
considerable volumes of drugs.

  [Text] (NOTIMEX) Federal District--The Office of the 
Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) has issued arrest 
warrants for Heriberto Deandar Martinez of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, 
owner of the publishing firm that prints the newspapers EL 
MANANA and LA TARDE, as well as for 10 other journalists. 
  In a communique, the department stated that, according to 
evidence gathered from various reports received, the owner of 
Demar Publishers and personnel from that company are connected 
with the drug traffic. They are also said to be using the 
publishing firm to protect criminals. 
  It noted that some of those presumed guilty of crimes 
against 
health have left the country, entering U.S. territory, where 
preliminary investigations were conducted against them. For this 
reason, the Mexican Government has now requested their 
extradition. 
  It specified that those accused include five board members, 
four reporters, and one section chief from the aforementioned 
publishing house, as well as three persons dissociated from it.

  [Text] Mexico City, D.F., 22 December (SUN)--The Office of 
the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] held a judge and a 
magistrate responsible for the release, three years ago, of the 
presumed drug trafficker, Amado Carrillo Fuentes. It claimed 
that he was freed even though the Federal Public Prosecutor's 
Office had sufficient evidence to charge him with crimes against 
health, and those of collecting and carrying firearms without a 
license. 
  In an official communique, the PGR explained that, during 
1990, it "never approved the release of Amado Carrillo; but, on 
the contrary, constantly objected to the judicial decisions that 
benefited him." 
  The magistrate cited in the document is Gilberto Chavez 
Pliego, of the third unified court of the first circuit; and the 
judge was the head of the 10th district court of criminal 
proceedings. 
  The document reveals that the PGR is currently intensifying 
its investigations to reinforce the indictment against the 
presumed drug trafficker. It was executed on 20 November, when 
the public prosecutor's office requested an arrest warrant for 
him, based on the crimes of collecting arms, storing cartridges 
and explosive ammunition, and criminal association. 
  The PGR states that, in August 1989, Carrillo Fuentes was 
captured with three other persons in Guadalajara and taken to 
Mexico City. He was presumed guilty of crimes against health, 
providing funds for the purchase of drugs, collecting weapons, 
and carrying a firearm without a license, as specified in 
preliminary investigation 3755-D-89. 
<H5>  Removing Drugs From Mexico </H5>
  He was held for trial on 27 August 1989 in the 10th district 
court of criminal proceedings. The trial was initiated for his 
presumed authorization of a fleet of air taxis for removing 
drugs from Mexico. Three days later, an order was issued for his 
formal imprisonment. 
  The department indicates that he appealed to the third 
unified court of the first circuit, as recorded in docket 
418-89-III-E. 
  On 9 April 1990, Magistrate Gilberto Chavez Pliego ordered 
his release "for lack of evidence supporting an indictment, 
benefiting all those accused of crimes against health and 
criminal association." 
  The PGR notes that, consequently, on 10 April 1990, Carrillo 
Fuentes petitioned the judge for his provisional release, which 
was granted with bail of 10 million old pesos. 
  On 12 June of that year, the Federal Public Prosecutor's 
Office reported its accusatory findings regarding his presumed 
guilt of the crime of arms collection. 
  Nevertheless, the same judge issued a verdict of acquittal 
in 
favor of the presumed drug trafficker, considering him "not 
liable." Therefore, he ordered the latter's absolute release. 
  After an appeal from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, 
the same unified court decided that the verdict was in favor of 
Amado Carrillo. Hence: "The Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic never released Amado Carrillo, and the 
investigation is currently being intensified," as the communique 
states in conclusion.

  [Excerpts] In various antidrug operations conducted in 14 
states and the Federal District, Judicial Police agents seized 
35 liters of hashish, or marijuana oil, slightly over five tons 
of cannabis indica, 207 kg of cocaine base, 234 kg of the 
chemical precursor known as ephedrine, one kg and 300 grams of 
heroin, and 1.5 kg of the substance called "crystal." The same 
investigations led to the arrests of 66 persons linked with the 
drug traffic, from whom the agents seized a total of 11 
heavy-caliber firearms, over 1,000 cartridges, and 32 automotive 
vehicles equipped for transporting drugs. 
  According to the briefing reports sent to the Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF] General Directorate, headed by Commander 
Adrian Carrera Fuentes, the most significant operation took 
place in the warehouses of a transportation company on the 
border in Tijuana, Baja California. There, the police found two 
plastic drums holding 35 liters of hashish resin, a highly toxic 
drug. 
  Upon his arrival to pick up the drug shipment, Agustin 
Corrantes Sanchez, who was loading the drug containers onto his 
pickup truck, was arrested by federal agents. With information 
he provided, the federal prosecutor's office ordered the arrest 
of his boss, who answers to the name of Jorge Abraham Zazueta 
Felix. Both subjects claimed that it was only a shipment of 
anti-oxidant used in the manufacture of lard. According to 
experts on the subject, to obtain hashish a ton of marijuana is 
required for each liter of the toxic substance. This means that 
at least 35 tons of cannabis indica were used to produce the 35 
liters confiscated. 
  Moreover, on the site known as "La Escondida," in Arramberi, 
Nuevo Leon, the Federal Judicial Police and municipal police 
seized two tons and 367 kg of dried and packed marijuana, bound 
for the border at Reynosa, Tamaulipas. From there, it was 
intended to be shipped to the United States. Arrested in the 
operation were the presumed drug dealers, Silvano Aguilar Colin 
and Filomeno Ruiz Martinez, who had concealed the drugs in the 
false bottom of a truck body. [passage omitted] 
  The PGR agency in Nayarit, for its part, announced the 
arrest 
of Peregrin Villagomez Bazan and Luis Alberto Gamez Hernandez in 
the vicinity of Ixtlan del Rio. They were carrying 182 kg of 
very high quality cocaine in five suitcases stored in the trunk 
of a sedan type vehicle. 
  In Quintana Roo, PJF personnel discovered 21 kg of the same 
alkaloid scattered on the Cancun beaches at a site known as 
Caleta de Manati. Presumably dropped by an airplane, the drugs 
were intended to wait for pickup by the fliers' accomplices, who 
would sell them. 
  The department's agency in Baja California, for its part, 
reported the seizure of 234 kg of the chemical precursor known 
as ephedrine. It was detected underneath the seats on a 
passenger bus driven by Jose Manuel Moctezuma Torres, Ramon 
Rosales Fernandez, and Gabriel Garcia Linares. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, 14 December--Since last 
February the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic 
[PGR] and district judges seized approximately 80 farms and 55 
residences from presumed drug traffickers in Tamaulipas. This 
announcement was made today by the director of the state's 
Public Property Register, Francisco Gerardo Campos Martinez. 
  Although not citing statistics, he claimed that the number 
of 
confiscations far exceeds those made of landed properties last 
year. 
  This increase is a result of the intensified action on the 
part of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic to 
combat the drug traffic since Carpizo McGregor became head of 
that department. 
  He stressed: "What has occurred is just a reflection of a 
more persistent battle against the drug trade by the PGR." 
  As for the confiscations, Campos Martinez claimed that most 
of the real estate and rural properties involved are located in 
the municipalities of Matamoros, Reynosa, Nuevo Laredo, and 
Miguel Aleman. 
  It should be noted that the judges and the PGR will maintain 
the impoundments until a determination is made of whether or not 
the owners are guilty of the illicit acts charged. 
  Finally, the official revealed that, in some instances, as 
many as two farms and several residences have been seized from a 
single presumed drug trafficker.

  [Text] Gregorio Rodriguez Benitez, the right-hand man of 
Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix (the presumed drug trafficker 
captured in Tijuana on 5 December), was arrested yesterday in 
Mazatlan, Sinaloa, by Federal Judicial Police agents. They were 
implementing an arrest warrant issued by the sixth district 
judge of that state, based on a charge that he committed the 
crime of collecting firearms that were for the exclusive use of 
the National Army, Navy, and Air Force. 
  With "El Goyo's" capture, the judicial authorities are 
confident that they will apprehend the rest of the ring that 
participated in the May shooting at the international airport in 
Guadalajara, Jalisco, resulting in the death of Cardinal Juan 
Jesus Posadas Ocampo. The prelate was mistaken for Joaquin 
"Chapo" Guzman, a member of the Sinaloa cartel currently 
confined in the maximum security prison in Almoloya de Juarez, 
Mexico State. 
  As was reported last Tuesday, these three persons had been 
fugitives from justice since the judge issued arrest warrants 
for them as persons presumed guilty of committing the 
aforementioned crime. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix is now 
imprisoned at Almoloya de Juarez, Mexico State; and Jose Alberto 
Loza, at the Rehabilitation Center in Mazatlan, Sinaloa. 
  As for the four subjects arrested with Arellano Felix, the 
Office of the Attorney General of the Republic remanded them to 
the fifth district judge of criminal proceedings in the Federal 
District. They are presumed guilty of having committed crimes of 
concealment and criminal association. 
  These individuals, Luis Enrique Cortes Satarain and Tomas 
Adan Velarde Espinoza, were also wanted for their probable links 
with the criminal group headed by Francisco Rafael Arellano. 
  Upon making their respective statements to the Public 
Prosecutor's Office, the accused admitted being in Arellano 
Felix's service. Some were engaged in surveillance activities to 
prevent the capture of their chief, whom they were providing 
with security as well. 
  All the accused, declaring that they were fully aware that 
Francisco Rafael was a fugitive from justice, admitted that, 
despite this, they were working to aid his concealment. 
  The legal status of those in custody will have to be decided 
by the judge in the case, based on the terms stipulated by law.

  [Text] By noon today approximately four tons of 
top-quality hashish had been taken from the hold and other 
hiding places of the yacht Gypsy Falcon, sailing under the 
British flag. The officials of Khania Customs Department 
believe that shocking things will be found as the ghost yacht is 
inspected completely. 
  The hashish, which was very carefully packed in 1-kg and 
2-kg 
cakes as well as in the form of tiles, was being taken by stages 
this morning by small trucks to safe storage at the Customs 
Department. 
  (Marco Ribic), 50, of Dubrovnik, who was the captain of the 
yacht and engineer (Denis Vitmar), 39, of Zagreb in the former 
Yugoslavia, who were the only two persons aboard the yacht, have 
been arrested and will probably be arraigned before the Khania 
prosecutor tomorrow. 
  According to reports, the yacht sailed from Yemen and 
through 
the Suez Canal was heading for Slovenia. However, because of 
engine trouble, it sailed into Khania port three days ago.

  [Excerpts] Over 50 million new pesos worth of heroin, 
cocaine, ephedrine, maritol, and packed marijuana were 
confiscated during the past 48 hours by Federal Judicial Police 
forces in counternarcotics operations conducted in 15 federative 
states. The traffickers presumably intended to smuggle the drugs 
into the United States for sale and consumption. 
  It was stressed that no incidents nor confrontations between 
authorities and criminals were reported during the activities. 
  The operations were carried out in Sonora, Baja California, 
Michoacan, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Sinaloa, Durango, Nayarit, 
Coahuila, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua, Jalisco, and 
Morelos. They also enabled the Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic [PGR] to arrest 52 presumed drug dealers, and to 
seize 13 vehicles, a boat with an outboard motor, five firearms, 
and scores of useful rounds, which are at the disposal of the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Offices. 
  It was specified that, at the highway checkpoint established 
on the outskirts of the town of Hermosillo, Sonora, federal 
agents intercepted a tank truck purported to be carrying liquid 
petroleum gas. However, over 4.5 tons of cannabis indica were 
found in its tank, outfitted with special compartments. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for Baja California State, the PGR reported that, in 
operations conducted in the towns of Tijuana and Mexicali, 
Humberto Fernandez Vazquez, Aurelia Peralta, Martha Bernal 
Silva, Margarita Montano Avila, Manuel Gracia Ramirez, and Juan 
Luevano Luna were arrested. They had in their possession 80 kg 
of ephedrine, a chemical precursor for refining cocaine and 
processing amphetamines. They intended to smuggle the ephedrine 
north into neighboring California. 
  Concurrently, at the ferry terminal in Pichilingue, Baja 
California Sur, the federal agents seized approximately two tons 
of compressed marijuana being transported in special 
compartments on a trailer body and under mudguards of a 
passenger bus. Two persons were placed at the disposal of the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in connection with this 
incident. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 21 December--A shipment of 
100 kg of ephedrine, a basic compound for processing the cocaine 
derivative known as "crack," was seized, together with 679 kg of 
marijuana. They were being transported on two trucks apparently 
loaded with tomatoes. This announcement was made here today by 
Rafael Aguilera Carrillo, the commander of the Federal Highway 
and Ports Police (PFCyP) in Ensenada. 
  He claimed that this discovery alerted federal authorities 
to 
the possible existence of laboratories specializing in the 
processing of the alkaloid, addiction to which can prove fatal 
to a person within five months. 
  Interviewed at the Tijuana airport, the police chief 
explained that the members of this force's patrol 33,403 
discovered the shipment when they responded to an automobile 
accident reported on the San Vicente-San Quintin section of the 
federal highway leading from Tijuana to Cabo San Lucas. 
  He added that they spotted the two trucks and, after 
noticing 
that the vehicles' drivers were visibly nervous, began 
inspecting them. 
  He indicated that the federal agents found the 100 kg of 
ephedrine and 679 kg of marijuana under the loads of tomatoes in 
the center of the vehicles. 
  In conclusion, he reported the arrest of Gerardo Montoya 
Villaman and Alberto David Rodriguez Leon, who were driving the 
trucks loaded with drugs to Tijuana, intending to smuggle them 
into the United States.

<F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz and Roberto Melendez S.] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic [PGR] described the fact that Federal Judicial Branch 
officials are releasing individuals linked with the drug trade 
as "very serious for society," because it "negates, to a large 
extent, the PGR's great efforts in the battle against the drug 
trade." It held two district judges of criminal proceedings and 
two magistrates of the National Supreme Court responsible for 
releasing Jose Adolfo de la Garza, alias "El Borrado," on bail 
of 100,000 new pesos. The latter is considered a "very important 
member" of the Matamoros cartel. 
  The Attorney General's Office confirmed that, during the 
past 
five years, thanks to our country's effort to eradicate the 
serious, increasing drug trafficking problem, approximately 
60,000 persons associated with crimes against health have been 
arrested and placed at the disposal of federal judges. Through 
inquiries made in courts and among prison authorities, it was 
learned that between 60 and 70 percent of them have regained 
their freedom, either through bail or bond, or have even been 
acquitted. 
  It was specified that the first secretary of Mexico City's 
seventh district court of criminal proceedings, Guadalupe 
Jimenez Nunez, who was serving last July as judge by operation 
of law; the head of the sixth district court, also in the 
nation's capital, Teresa Irma Fragoso Perez; and the 
magistrates, Vicente Salazar Vera and Juan Silva Meza, decided 
to release the drug trafficker, and this occurred on 2 December. 
The PGR noted that they did so despite the appeals filed by the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office [MPF]. 
  Through a communique released yesterday afternoon, the PGR 
explained that, based on an arrest warrant issued by the fourth 
district court of criminal proceedings in Tamaulipas State, 
located in Matamoros, De la Garza was captured by Federal 
Judicial Police agents on 25 June of this year in Ciudad Juarez, 
Chihuahua. Since he was regarded as extremely dangerous, he was 
taken to Mexico City. 
  The PGR added that Jose Adolfo was identified by the 
authorities as a person presumed guilty of the crimes of cocaine 
possession, trafficking, and illegal export, as well as criminal 
association. Therefore, Jimenez Nunez, then serving as judge by 
operation of law in the seventh district court, took a 
preliminary statement from him based on letters requisitorial 
from his counterpart in Matamoros. 
  Later, on 14 July, according to the institution, Jimenez 
Nunez himself ordered the release of the person then indicted, 
arguing that there was no evidence for trying him. It stressed 
that this verdict was appealed by the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office, and that the final decision was to be made 
by the third unified court of Matamoros. 
  The PGR explained that, as stated in criminal proceedings 
No. 
62/93, "El Borrado" also has been accused of the crimes of 
possession, manufacture, packing, transport, purchase and sale, 
trafficking, and the illegal entry of drugs into the country. He 
was further charged with contributing funds to finance the 
trading of the "narcotic designated cocaine," carrying firearms 
intended for exclusive use by the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and 
criminal association. 
  It added that the sixth district judge of criminal 
proceedings, Teresa Irma Fragoso Perez, after hearing the case, 
issued an order for his formal imprisonment solely on the count 
of criminal association, ordering his release on the other 
counts. The document goes on to say that, in view of this 
situation, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office filed an 
appeal, which happened to be heard in the fourth unified court 
of the Federal District. The head of that court, Vicente Salazar 
Vera, confirmed the decision challenged by the public prosecutor. 
  Pursuant to the court's verdict, on 23 July Judge Fragoso 
Perez ordered a provisional release on bail for Jose Adolfo de 
la Garza, to which the MPF also objected. Nevertheless, despite 
the prosecutor's express dissent concerning the release of the 
accused, the second unified court of the first circuit, headed 
by Magistrate Juan Silva Meza, confirmed the judge's order. On 2 
December of this year, the presumed drug trafficker's release 
became effective, after he had posted bail of 100,000 new pesos. 
  Referring to De la Garza's release, the PGR emphasized that 
"this situation is very serious for society, and negates, to a 
large extent, the great efforts of the Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic in the battle against the drug traffic." 
It described that individual as "a very important member of the 
cartel headed by the `capo,' Juan Garcia Abrego," chief of the 
Matamoros criminal group. [passage omitted] 
  Similarly, from inquiries made among prison authorities and 
public servants in the Federation's Judicial Branch, it was 
determined that at least some 60,000 persons remanded for crimes 
against health have regained their freedom during the past five 
years. Moreover, approximately 30,000 others are currently 
subject to trial, or already serving prison sentences for those 
illicit acts. 
  It should be noted that this is not the first time that the 
Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has made public 
its dissent with judges and magistrates who have released 
presumed Mafia "capos" linked to the drug traffic.

  [Text] Campeche, Camp., 21 December--In an operation 
conducted on the Yucatan Peninsula, forces from the Office of 
the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) succeeded in 
dismantling one of the leading drug trafficking rings operating 
in the country, headed by the Colombian, Antonio Bermudez. The 
PGR agents captured 21 of its members, who were found to have in 
their possession approximately a ton of pure cocaine, which they 
were attempting to market in the neighboring state of Quintana 
Roo. This announcement was made at a press conference today by 
the PGR's state representative, Antonio Tiro Sanchez. 
  The report added that six late-model cars with Quintana Roo 
plates were also seized, as well as a fuel tanker that was 
hauling the alkaloid. The operation began at dawn last Sunday, 
when the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] intercepted a tank truck 
in the vicinity of the settlement of Escarcega, Campeche. Owned 
by the company Traga, Adjustable Capital Corp., with license 
plates 045TX9, it was carrying 22 gas cylinders containing 711 
kg of cocaine. 
  No armed confrontations were reported in this seizure, 
during 
which Gilberto Erick Gomez Ortega, Felipe Corro Alcantara, 
Daniel Soto Vargas, and Antonio Reyes Cabanas were arrested. All 
are members of the organization led by Bermudez who were 
guarding the shipment in an imported luxury car with Quintana 
Roo plates URD8679. 
  According to the bulletin issued by the PGR, from the 
preliminary statements made by Antonio Reyes Cabanas while in 
custody, the police obtained the names of those who were to 
receive the shipment by sea in the neighboring town of Chetumal. 
They also learned the identities of the subjects waiting for it 
in Cancun, Quintana Roo. 
  PJF personnel in Chetumal arrested Antonio Ordonez Rodriguez 
and Gregorio Barradas Montero. Meanwhile, in Cancun, they 
captured Jose Luis Sierra Rodriguez, of Spanish nationality; 
Luis Carlos Pinto Camacho, alias "Ramiro Vazquez Perez"; and 
Humberto Segundo Montenegro Freyre, alias "Alberto Rodriguez 
Garcia," or "Alberto Garcia Aleman," the latter two of Colombian 
nationality. Also arrested were the Mexicans, Benjamin Reyes 
Cabanas and Mario Fuentes Perez, from whom three late-model cars 
with Quintana Roo plates were confiscated. 
  The statements from those under arrest made it possible to 
intercept, early Monday morning, a vehicle being driven along 
Itzaes Avenue in the city of Merida in Yucatan State. Riding in 
it were nine persons who were guarding 199 packages containing 
nearly 400 kg of cocaine. 
  Tiro Sanchez revealed that the nine subjects arrested were 
members of the ring led by the Colombian, Antonio Bermudez, and 
answer to the names of: Gustavo Adolfo Ayala Ramos, Jorge Alonso 
Uraga Paez, Manuel Olmeda Gutierrez, Luis Vega Rivas, Alberto 
Vega Rivas, Jorge Peraza Bernal, Jose Espinoza Dominguez, 
Cipriano Beltran Madueno, and Hernan Valdez Apodacas. Two cars 
and a passenger van were seized from these drug dealers. 
  The official denied that any confrontations had occurred 
during the arrests. He claimed that, after the case records are 
completed by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, those 
responsible, with the items and equipment found in their 
possession, would be placed at the disposal of the authorized 
judge.

<H5>  Morocco </H5>
  Over 1400 kgs of drugs were seized by the customs 
authorities 
of Tangiers in northern Morocco, police sources said. The 
seized drug was concealed in sardine and olive cans loaded in a 
truck driven by a Polish national, the same sources added,

the tri-city ports of Gdansk, Gdynia, and Sopot in northern 
Poland, Jozef Fedosiuk from the regional prosecutor's office in 
Gdynia reported. 
  The cocaine was found in a container that, according to 
cargo 
documents, contained bananas and coffee. The cocaine was packed

Russian border troops, told INTERFAX in an exclusive interview 
that on January 20 and 21 he was to meet with the commanders of 
the Finnish border guard service to discuss cooperation "in 
rather complicated conditions." He said that lately commercial 
enterprises and private individuals had intensified smuggling 
and black-marketeering across the Russian-Finnish border. 
Whereas in 1992, 92.3 billion rubles worth of contraband goods 
and slightly more than 130 kilograms of narcotics were 
confiscated, last year the same indices stood at 659.4 million 
rubles and 1,096 kilograms. [amounts as received] (Moscow

was impregnated with cocaine brought from Colombia and Venezuela 
to Valencia. The police noticed it at the Barajas airport in 
Madrid on 31 December, but no arrests were made until 14 January 
when the police arrested the man driving a small truck near 
Valencia as well as five other people. Three were arrested in 
Bilbao in Basque country. The people who were arrested had been 
followed by the police since 1992. In Valencia, they set up a 
firm importing seafood, the firm which was due to receive the 
seized merchandise. According to the police, an entire ring of 
drug traffickers operating in the country and with links to drug 
traffickers in Colombia and Venezuela has been arrested with

Airport via Amsterdam, said a Customs spokesman. The two men, 
both Colombians, were arrested in Manchester later. The seizure 
follows an intensive four-month intelligence operation in the 
Manchester area. (London PRESS ASSOCIATION 1359 GMT 17 Jan 94)

  [Text] Brazilian President Itamar Franco and Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria today created a commission to fight drug 
trafficking between the two countries. President Franco was in 
Leticia, Colombia, at the Brazilian border this morning. 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] Tabatinga, in the 
Amazon, is a border town where Brazil ends and Colombia begins. 
It does not produce anything, and its life depends on the 
government. Leticia, in Colombia, is in the same condition. The 
difference is that Leticia is in a country where the inflation 
rate does not reach 2 percent a month. But as the two towns are 
so close, the people experience the same social problems. 
Therefore the only solution for them is joint economic 
development. 
  This is why President Itamar Franco came to Colombia to 
install with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria a neighborhood 
commission. From now on businessmen and representatives of the 
two governments will meet periodically in the border towns to 
discuss and find solutions to improving the standard of living 
of the population of the two towns. For example, the commission 
will carry out joint actions to fight cholera, and even drug 
trafficking, because a large part of the cocaine that goes to 
Europe and the United States comes from Colombia to Brazil 
through the Solimoes and Amazon Rivers. 
  In the speeches installing the commission, the presidents of 
Colombian and Brazil agreed that the union of the South American 
countries is the best way for development.

<F P=106> [News Conference by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro </F>
and Honduran President Rafael Callejas with foreign and domestic 
reporters and an unidentified moderator at the Presidential 
Palace in Managua; broadcast in progress--live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Moderator] We can take two 
more questions, considering the president must leave now. Daniel 
Croto from REUTER and Roberto Vargas from Radio Mundial. 
  Croto: Good evening, a question for President 
Callejas. I would also like to ask him about the guerrilla 
commander, known as El Chacal. During the Honduran election 
campaign, the Nicaraguan media quoted the Nicaraguan Army as 
saying that El Chacal had entered Honduran territory. The 
Honduran Army confirmed his presence but later denied it. My 
question is if (politics) is generating the information we are 
receiving on this case? 
  Callejas: I met with AFP and Univision 
representatives and both told me that the so-called El Chacal 
was a Honduran. If that is the case, it would be a whole 
different situation if he were in our country. I actually think 
we are giving too much importance to a situation that does not 
have any significance in my country. I personally have not 
received any report from any government source about the 
existence of this gentleman. As I told the journalist who asked 
me the same question, we in government have no knowledge of the 
whereabouts or the actions of El Chacal. 
  I can tell you frankly that we have no reason to avoid 
releasing that information. I asked the foreign minister and we 
have had no military intelligence reports. I have no information 
of any kind. The only information I have received about El 
Chacal in the past few months came from a Univision journalist 
and an AFP journalist. 
  Moderator: Roberto Vargas and [name indistinct] 
after him. 
  Vargas: Mr. President Rafael Leonardo Callejas, as 
a Nicaraguan I am proud to have you in my country. For the two 
years I lived in Honduras I was treated well. My question is the 
following: We are alarmed about drug trafficking. We have four 
cartels in Managua. A drug trafficking cartel was caught near 
Atahualinca. I would like to know if you could give our 
Nicaraguan Army or our National Police some type of training so 
they can better locate drug traffickers. Apparently we do not 
have that many well-trained people. 
  I would also like to ask her excellency, the president of 
the 
Republic, who loves us so much, a question: Could you ask the 
DEA for technical assistance to train young men, people who want 
to work and locate drug traffickers? 
  Chamorro: Could you repeat your last question 
please? I did not hear it, perhaps because of the echo here. 
  Vargas: I also have voice problems. Could you ask 
the DEA for technical assistance to train policemen so they can 
locate drugs. Drugs enter Managua and the police never find out 
about it. 
  Callejas As for the drug trafficking problem in 
the Central American and Caribbean region, I would like to note 
that there are a series of agreements signed among ourselves. 
The Central American region has an agreement to fight drug 
trafficking. This agreement, which includes all Central American 
countries, also has direct relations with Venezuela, Colombia, 
Mexico, and the DEA. We are all part of a program in the fight 
against drug traffickers. There are even radar installations 
that cover the Caribbean, and there are information service 
installations at the U.S. Southern Command. 
  All Central American countries are making a great effort to 
fight drug trafficking. It is a difficult fight because, while 
the drug traffickers have economic resources, the Central 
American countries have huge limitations. The latest U.S. 
foreign policy decisions do not emphasize the fight against drug 
trafficking as much as in the past. It concentrates more on the 
producing countries, and therefore, all Central American 
countries must make a common effort because drug trafficking has 
no borders. 
  There are agreements, there are direct relations, and I 
would 
like to say that what one reads in the media are police success 
stories in this fight in each one of our countries. There was an 
important drug seizure in Honduras and Nicaragua recently. The 
effort done by the Honduran police against this scourge of 
society is very important despite the huge limitations. 
  Chamorro: As president of Nicaragua, I can tell 
you we have an agreement with the United States under which we 
will continue helping as they continue helping us. A large 
number of drug traffickers have been identified, who, by the 
way, are under arrest. Besides, my dear journalist friends, I 
wanted to tell you I believe that all Nicaraguans, as President 
Rafael Leonardo Callejas has just said, have to work to produce. 
As good reporters you should report to the authorities when 
something wrong is going on. We should help each other as [words 
indistinct] in this field. We all have to get down and work for 
our nation to achieve peace and tranquillity. No one should be 
abusing or selling drugs. I condemn all of these things that are 
taking place. We all have to work for our fatherland. [passage

  [Text] Nassau, Bahamas, Jan 23, CANA -- Bahamas has 
recorded a definite decline in trafficking of illegal drugs 
through a new anti-drug effort between the Bahamas, Turks and 
Caicos Islands and the United States, says Public Safety and 
Transport Minister Arlington Butler. 
  Operation Bahamas Turks and Caicos Islands (OPBAT), a 
cooperative effort involving the three territories, was started 
in April 1992 to stamp out the drug trade. 
  And already, 18 months later, Butler says cocaine 
trafficking through the islands has dropped. 
  The public safety minister added that the 1993 total for 
cocaine seizure, though not yet official, was expected to be 
just about 700 kilos. 
  "This is an 86 per cent decline from the 4.85 metric tons 
seized in 1992 and it is the lowest annual seizure total since 
late 1970," he said. 
  The minister explained that another first for the Bahamas in 
1993, was that there was not a single interception of cocaine at 
an airstrip in the Bahamas. 
  "The fact that only two airdrops were intercepted in 
Bahamian territorial waters compared to six in international 
waters show great respect for the OPBAT and an obvious decline 
in the traffic." 
  Butler noted that for the 18 months OPBAT has been in 
operation--from April, 1992, through December 31, 1993--only 
1.59 metric tons of cocaine was seized in Bahamas. 
  And 1.85 metric tons were seized in international waters, 
much of it close to the north coast of Cuba. 
  "I think we can conclude that our remarkable joint OPBAT 
programme has brought the traffic of cocaine from Colombia to 
South Florida through the Bahamas down to irreducible minimum 
during this 18 month period." 
  The public safety minister also reported a fall by more than 
half, in the number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment, as a 
direct result of the anti-drug programme. 
  This, he said, indicated that the drug problem was 
"receding" or "stable."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Who Controls the DEA?"] </F>
  [Text] The new Social Defense secretary--who is in charge 
of drug enforcement actions--was asked a few days ago if he knew 
how many DEA agents operate in Bolivia. The high-ranking 
government official said he did not know. 
  Does any government official know the answer? An 
investigation by this newspaper has showed that no one can. 
Neither the Ministry of Government nor the Foreign Ministry 
really know how many DEA agents operate in Bolivia. This is 
because they are hidden among the U.S. Embassy staff. 
  This issue came into the limelight more than a year ago when 
a DEA agent wounded a Bolivian citizen in Santa Cruz. He was 
immediately expatriated. The explanation given at that time was 
that he was accredited as a diplomat. He thus had diplomatic 
immunity under which, according to the Vienna Convention, the 
host country grants immunity to representatives of the 
governments with whom it maintains relations. 
  The Vienna Convention establishes that it is not necessary 
for an embassy to inform a host government on the functions of 
its embassy personnel because it is understood that their 
activities will be strictly restricted to diplomatic norms. 
There is a clear contradiction, however, between the work done 
by the DEA agents and these norms which are being ignored by 
both the DEA and the rest of the U.S. embassy members, who on 
more than on one occasion have openly intervened in internal 
Bolivian affairs. 
  The main subject that interests us--that is, the "safe 
houses" that the DEA keeps in several Bolivian cities where 
alleged drug traffickers are questioned--deserves official 
explanation. 
  Claiming that the national police do not merit confidence 
because connections have been found between some officers and 
drug traffickers does not justify a third party carrying out the 
duties of the Bolivian State. 
  Both the district prosecutor and the Human Rights Assembly 
of 
Santa Cruz have said that these agents ignore Bolivian laws and 
their actions are not controlled by our national authorities who 
have limited themselves to say: "There is no smoke without 
fire." What is worse, the DEA chief refuses to receive a 
national deputy in his office to discuss the charges. 
  We must recall that this is not the first time that this 
kind 
of irregular procedures by the DEA has been made public. During 
the last administration, former Interior Minister Carlos 
Saavedra Bruno was very concerned about charges that were made 
and he said he would ask the U.S. Embassy for a report on the 
activities of these "diplomats." The subject was not discussed 
again, however, because of the election campaign flurry. But 
the fact that the issue has again come to the limelight shows 
that it cannot be controlled by our authorities. And this 
cannot be so. 
  Following the announcement that the new U.S. drug 
enforcement 
policy has ruled out the militarization of the issue and efforts 
will be concentrated on police interdiction--which certainly is 
good news--it is necessary to establish clear rules that must be 
respected by any kind of foreign "advisers" in this field. 
Beside preserving our national sovereignty on such a sensitive 
subject, the establishment of an agreement will help the two 
countries to maintain relations in an atmosphere of mutual 
respect.

  [Text] Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz Valenzuela has 
said that Colombian "Medellin" and "Cali" drug cartel planes 
make short but important trips into Bolivian territory, taking 
advantage of the speed of their light planes. 
  "The make quick incursions using light planes to collect 
drugs, usually from clandestine airstrips," Soliz said. 
  The secretary told journalists that the police are unable to 
interdict those flights because they are small, random, 
difficult to detect, and do not follow a set timetable. 
  Soliz Valenzuela said the constant violation of Bolivian 
airspace occurs because the borders are long and "difficult to 
control." 
  He said: "The presence of Colombian drug cartels in Bolivia 
is of obvious concern because they encourage cocaine paste 
production." 
  He added, however, that our authorities are doing everything 
necessary to prevent it from getting out of control. 
  Asked about reports on abuses involving DEA agents, Soliz 
said there are no specific reports that can be investigated. 
  "Reports are made in general terms. No one has mentioned 
names or specific cases, otherwise we would have acted 
immediately and punished those responsible," Soliz said. 
  He said the government does not know how many DEA agents 
operate in the country. 
  "I will ask the DEA coordinator in the country for a 
complete 
report to find out how many operate in Bolivia," Soliz concluded.

  [Excerpt] (Guido Lucatto), allegedly a member of the 
Italian Mafia, was arrested in Santa Cruz and has been 
transferred to La Paz. While he faces no narcotrafficking 
charges in Bolivia, there are grounds to deport him because he 
carries a forged passport. 
  Here is a report by Amalia Pando: 
  A capo of the Italian Mafia was arrested on 17 January in 
Santa Cruz. He will be deported without any judicial 
proceedings within a few hours or days. Four Italian policemen 
arrived in Bolivia yesterday to take him away. 
  He arrived in Bolivia in August 1992 carrying an Italian 
passport issued to the name of (Guido Lucatto) but it has been 
established that the passport is forged. His real name is 
(Salvatore Sciula). He was born in Palermo on 21 February 1950. 
He is 44 years old. He is married to Chilean citizen (Claudia 
Guzman Onoratto). He was arrested by the Santa Cruz Special 
Force with the cooperation of the Italian Police and Interpol. 
  (Salvatore Sciula) was arrested at 0900 on 17 January. He 
and an unidentified man tried to flee when they realized they 
were being followed while crossing a downtown street aboard a 
black jeep. (Sciula) was arrested but his companion is still at 
large. Right now fingerprint tests are being conducted to verify 
that this is the man being sought by the Italian Police.

  [Text] The Federal Police today seized 198 kg of pure 
cocaine in the southwest of Goias, and discovered an important 
drug route. 
  The cocaine was seized in Aparecida do Rio Doce on highway 
364 linking Goias with Sao Paulo. This road is considered by 
the Federal Police to be the cocaine road, one of the main 
routes for distributing drugs coming from Bolivia. 
  The 198 kg of pure cocaine, wrapped in plastic bags, were 
hidden in two trucks used for carrying cattle. To carry the 
cocaine the drug traffickers had built a false bottom into the 
truck's body. The pressed cocaine was hidden inside the steel 
and wooden frames and covered with a mixture of cow's manure and 
rice husks to cover up the smell of cocaine. 
  According to the Federal Police, who have been chasing the 
drug traffickers for 20 days, the cocaine load, valued at about 
600 million real cruzeiros, came from Alto Araguaia in Mato 
Grosso and was being taken to Uberaba and Uberlandia in the 
triangle region of Minas Gerais.

  [Text] Leticia (Colombia), 22 Jan (EFE) -- Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria today rejected the wave of criticisms 
leveled against his government for allowing U.S. troops to enter 
the country for cooperation missions and asserted that Americans 
have been in Colombia since World War II. 
  The statement has prompted strong criticism of the 
government 
and president, particularly from the opposition, although some 
of the president's own party members have also been critical. 
  Gaviria said that although citizens have a right to protest, 
behind these criticisms he perceives the presence of "dark 
forces" with personal interests that include drug trafficking. 
  "I want to point out that U.S. soldiers have been in 
Colombia 
since the end of World War II. In every administration, 
military missions have provided cooperation in accordance with 
the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty," Gaviria said. 
  Gaviria asserted that this cooperation is intended "to 
train, 
equip, and professionalize our Armed Forces in aerial matters 
and to provide cooperation in the struggle against drug 
trafficking." 
  The president said it is a paradox that while numerous 
clandestine flights "violate our sovereignty every day," such a 
fuss is being made over "cooperation requested by the Colombian 
Armed Forces." 
  "Joint engineering exercises have also been carried out, 
such 
as those in Juanchaco, those in San Jose del Guavi, and those 
under way in Puerto Lopez, where a river outpost is being built. 
Most of the residents of the regions in question want these 
projects" Gaviria said. 
  "This," he added, "does not mean that citizens should not 
demand explanations or ask why the cooperation is taking place, 
but many of the criticisms are ill-intentioned and the result of 
obscure interests linked to drug trafficking."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 20 Jan (AFP) -- Emisoras Caracol

Supreme Court of Justice, that this court has authorized the 
extradition to the United States of an Ecuadoran arrested last 
year in Colombia. 
  The man under arrest is Raul Eduardo Reyes Torres, one of 
Ecuador's most wanted criminals. The Ecuadoran authorities 
accuse him of being part of the Reyes Magos cocaine clan, the 
radio network reported. 
  Reyes was captured in June 1993 in the city of Cali in 
possession of false documents that say he is a Colombian 
citizen. According to the report, Reyes Torres is wanted by a 
Denver federal court on drug-trafficking charges.

  The clandestine group made the announcement in a letter to 
Hermilda Gaviria de Escobar, mother of the late drug trafficker 
Pablo Escobar, in which it reported that, contrary to the 
intentions of the Escobar family to sign a peace agreement, 
remnants of the Medellin Cartel are not thinking of peace. 
  "You and the criminal organization of your late son know of 
our capacity. Our objective is to stop the appearance of new 
Machiavellian individuals like Pablo Escobar," the Pepes noted. 
It added that "your intention is not shared by the remaining 
Medellin Cartel members. This is an aspect that worries us 
because it would turn us into victims, a situation that we will 
not accept under any circumstances."

  [Text] Quito, 23 Jan (AFP) -- Ecuadoran Police announced on 
Sunday that they seized a large quantity of cocaine 
hydrochlorate, with an estimated value of more than $2 million, 
which Colombian drug trafficking groups were trying to transship 
through Ecuador. 
  In the first case, the drug had been cleverly camouflaged 
inside 100 meters of electrical cable which Colombian Cesar 
Augusto Andrade Gomez was trying to export to Rome. According 
to a police spokesman, Aldo J. Come, whose nationality has not 
been established, was to receive the package in Rome. Andrade 
was arrested at a post office branch in Quito where an Interpol 
agent inspected the package and discovered that the cocaine had 
been cleverly wrapped with protective plastic inside the cable. 
  Police also reported the arrest of a Colombian couple, 
Libardo Santander Benavides and his wife Berta Vargas Reina, who 
were keeping several packages of cocaine hydrochlorate in their 
home in Yaruqui, approximately 20 km northeast of Quito. The 
drug was brought into the country through Putumayo on the 
Colombian-Ecuadoran border. 
  Recently, the authorities also seized more than half a ton 
of 
cocaine in Guayaquil hidden in several Colombian products such 
as coffee, cookies, and candies, that were to be sent in a ship 
to the United States and Canada. 
  Police sources indicated that operations continue to 
dismantle what seems to be an international drug trafficking 
organization that is using Ecuador as a "bridge" as a result of 
the persecution against the Colombian cartels.

  [Text] Yesterday, Government Minister Arnoldo Oriz Moscoso 
said he plans to counter drug trafficking in Central America in 
1994 by reinforcing international agreements. 
  He gave the information outside the National Palace after 
being asked what he knew about the arrest of Guatemalan citizen 
Velmar Espina Novo, who was involved in a cocaine shipment in 
Nicaragua. Ortiz said: "For the time being we have no official 
information only that a person was arrested. We will therefore 
solicit information on the alleged Guatemalan drug trafficker 
and the alleged member of the military, Byron Robeto Morales." 
  He said there are signed agreements on antidrug trafficking, 
which will be put into effect with the United States, Colombia, 
Mexico, and the remaining isthmian countries. Ortiz admitted 
Guatemala is becoming more and more a bridge for drugs and a 
storage center as well. 
  Regarding the death of inmates in penitentiaries, he said 
each case is being investigated, although most deaths seem to be 
prompted by fights or personal vengeance.

  [Text] A shortage of staff, inadequate transportation and 
equipment at the Narcotics Division of the Jamaica Constabulary 
Force are hampering the Government's drugs eradication programme. 
  Drug raids and hauls are being severely hampered because of 
the inadequate facilities and this comes amidst a rise in drug 
trafficking over the last six months. 
  There are only about 11 officers now on staff at the 
Narcotics Division, less than half the required cadre of 25, 
said Senior Superintendent Oswald Dwyer, chief at the Narcotics 
Division. 
<H5>  Raids </H5>
  Added to this problem, the Division does not have enough 
vehicles for the officers and this is affecting movement during 
emergencies and raids. Although Superintendent Dwyer was unable 
to say how many vehicles the Division has and how much [words 
missing], THE GLEANER understands that there is frequent 
rotation of vehicles used by the Narcotics Division. 
  Even sniffer dogs, the most important drug detection 
component, are in limited supply. However, a move is being made 
to get and train additional dogs. The dogs are used to detect 
illegal drugs at the island's ports and the two international 
airports. 
  The Narcotics Chief, however, pointed out that the Division 
is trying its best to detect, as much as possible, all 
contraband drugs coming in and going out the island through the 
island's airports and ports. 
  About 33,979 kg of ganja were seized between January and 
August this year. In 1991 about 41,393 kg were seized, 1.2 kg 
less than the amount seized last year. 
  Up to August this year, 61 kg of cocaine had been seized 
along with 511 pieces of crack. In 1991 the division seized some 
68 kg of cocaine and 1,057 pieces of crack while in 1992 the 
amount of cocaine seized had risen to 661 kg.

  [Text] Between January 1 and September 31, this year 953 
persons were arrested for dealing in and trafficking in illegal 
drugs, according to Minister of National Security and Justice, 
K.D. Knight. 
  He pointed out that 248 of those persons were foreigners, 
some of whom were part of an international network. 
  Mr. Knight was speaking on Tuesday at the opening of a 
seminar on laws and practices related to the seizure of assets 
of convicted drug offenders, hosted by the Faculty of Law of the 
University of the West Indies and the United Nations Drug 
Control Programme at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel in Kingston. 
  He said 35,325 kilograms of ganja, 151 kilograms of cocaine, 
580 pieces of crack and 70 kilograms of hash oil were also 
seized during the period. Seven vehicles used in drug related 
crimes were also confiscated. 
  "A part of the horrendous violence that has afflicted the 
world has a direct link to the trade. Deals go sour, people end 
up dead. Abusers need money to satisfy their addiction, people 
end up dead," said Mr. Knight. He said the struggle against drug 
trafficking was tantamount to a war to preserve the nation's 
health, the people's safety and the children's future. 
  The five-day seminar was aimed at educating police officers, 
prosecutors and magistrates in the laws and practices related to 
the seizure of assets in drug trafficking. Other seminars will 
be held in Barbados, Belize, Grenada and Guyana.

  [Excerpts] Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar said the 
drug operation in Popoyo Beach, Rivas was staged by Nicaraguan 
authorities. The DEA only supplied information as part of a 
cooperation protocol signed with Nicaragua. 
  Nicaragua maintains a constant battle against drug 
trafficking. The last operation that took place in Rivas, where 
275 kg of cocaine were seized, is a demonstration of this 
effort. Since 1991, Nicaragua maintains relations and exchanges 
information with the DEA. Information exchanges are also 
maintained with narcotic information centers in Mexico, 
Colombia, and Costa Rica. The Popoyo Beach operation was 
basically carried out by Nicaraguan authorities. Here is what 
Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar said: 
  [Begin Cesar recording] We spoke with the DEA information 
center about the Popoyo operation because it had information on 
aircraft overflights too. The information they gave us 
contributed to the success of this operation. Nevertheless, I 
want to point out the operation was carried out exclusively by 
Nicaraguans. More than 50 National Police agents were involved, 
although a couple of DEA agents, who we had given prior approval 
to, did participate. They have some technical facilities that 
allow operations such as these to be a success. [end recording] 
  In another turn of events, Cesar said the airplane that made 
an emergency landing at Puerto Cabezas was because it ran out of 
fuel. Two Peruvians were traveling in this aircraft. The police 
searched the aircraft but no drugs were found. 
  [Begin Cesar recording] It is a matter of concern when an 
airplane runs out of fuel and makes an emergency landing. We 
have photocopies of their passports and the names of the people 
who were aboard the aircraft. We have all the necessary 
information; however, nothing was found. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] Lima EXPRESO in Spanish on 9 January 
publishes on pages A20 and A21 a 1,000-word article by 
journalist Damian Retamozo noting that the Interior Ministry 
recently issued a report on antidrug operations and terrorism 
cases in 1993. The Interior Ministry report notes that drug 
trafficking activities in Peru grew 23.83 percent; police 
actions totaled 3,938 in 1993 while in 1992 they totaled 3,180; 
arrests linked to drug trafficking activities totaled 4,555; and 
8,571 kg of drugs were seized. The report adds that about 600 
metric tons of cocaine paste were produced in 1993, that only 1 
percent of processed drugs was seized during interdiction 
operations; and that 2,417 terrorist crimes were reported in 
1993, as compared to 2,995 terrorist crimes reported in 1992.

  [Text] A PNP [Peruvian National Police] National 
Antinarcotics Directorate (Dinandro) spokesman has said that 
U.S. assistance in the fight against drug trafficking in Upper 
Huallaga has been cut back, but not eliminated. The U.S. 
Embassy also said that the U.S. Government has not suspended 
that assistance. 
  Our source said that the fact that the 10 UH-1H and Bell 212 
helicopters owned by the U.S. Department of State had been moved 
to the Pucallpa base does not mean that helicopter operations 
have been suspended. 
  It was reported that the helicopters have more space to 
operate from Pucallpa. 
  The spokesman said that if required, four helicopters can 
fly 
to Tarapoto and take Dinandro personnel to the area chosen for 
an intervention. 
  If helicopter support is required in Ciudad Constitucion 
(Junin) similar trips can be arranged. 
  It was also reported that helicopters can depart from their 
base in Pucallpa and easily reach the La Convencion (Cuzco) 
valley or Palmapampa (Ayacucho jungle zone), which are areas of 
intense coca production. 
  The sources reported that two planes that the U.S. 
Department 
of State had placed at the disposal of the Peruvian police for 
the transportation of personnel and equipment from Lima to the 
"Santa Lucia" antinarcotics base (Upper Huallaga) have already 
returned to the United States. 
  That was the reason why the climate in "Santa Lucia" was one 
of uncertainty and scarcity. 
  The Air Force was making regular flights to that base 
carrying gasoline, food, and personnel. 
  The fuel for generators used in the Upper Huallaga base, as 
well as food shipped to the PNP and FAP and the $90 per month 
incentive for police personnel assigned to Upper Huallaga, have 
also been curtailed. 
  The "Santa Lucia" base has, however, an FAP M-17 helicopter 
with greater capacity for carrying personnel, which can be used 
for helicopter antinarcotic operations. 
  It was reported, however, that those operations are 
difficult 
to carry out during these months due to the bad weather 
prevailing in the jungle zone.

  [Text] Two Peruvian Air Force (FAP) officers are being 
tried by the Air Force Military Justice Supreme Council 
following the discovery of their participation in illegal 
activities during antinarcotics operations at Tocache and 
Saposoa, San Martin Department, between July and August 1993. 
  The officers in question are FAP Majors Alfredo Ruiz Hurtado 
and Enrique Pavia Alvarez. 
  The information was confirmed by Defense Minister Victor 
Malca Villanueva last month through a note remitted to Congress 
First Vice President Carlos Torres y Torres Lara on 1 December. 
The note was the defense minister's answer to a request for 
details made by leftist legislator Julio Castro Gomez. 
  Major Ruiz Hurtado was in charge of Uchiza's Air Force base 
from 2 to 31 July of last year. During that period the major 
charged fees for permitting airplanes transporting drugs from 
the area to take off. 
  The initial report on the irregular situation was made by 
the 
FAP personnel who replaced the major. As a consequence, a 
special board was appointed to investigate the case. At the end 
of the investigation the major was accused of being directly 
responsible, and was immediately placed at the disposal of the 
High-Ranking Officers Investigating Council and the FAP War 
Council, which opened an inquiry that is still going on. 
  Major Enrique Pavia Alvarez, in turn, was in charge of 
Sapasoa's Air Force base from 17 July to 15 August 1993. Pavia 
confessed to having illegally participated in the interdiction 
of a light plane carrying drugs. He testified to this effect 
before the Sixth Territorial Region's commander general, based 
in Santa Lucia. 
  According to Minister Malca's report, Enrique Pavia said he 
acted the way he did, "on 14 August, the day before he was 
replaced, because he was being pressured by civilian authorities 
(political and judicial) and members of the city's forces of 
order." 
  "In view of the situation the commander ordered the 
beginning 
of an investigation and transferred him to Lima. The case is 
currently under administrative investigation by the FAP as well 
as under judicial investigation by the Air Force War Council," 
Minister Malca's report said. 
  "It is not clearly established, however, why are they being 
tried by the military justice. Neither is it a common crime," 
congressman Castro Gomez told EXPRESO.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "From Chiapas to Huallaga"] </F>
  [Text] The theory that EXPRESO was the first in the world 
to propose--that the international drug trafficking world is 
behind the armed uprising in Chiapas, southern Mexico--appears 
to have been confirmed. That is not surprising to us. 
  Of the heroin consumed in the United States, 23 percent 
comes 
from Mexico, particularly from the Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero 
States, where poppies are cultivated. The plant was also 
cultivated in Sonora, in northern Mexico, until a few months 
ago. But joint operations by Mexican Police and the DEA have 
reportedly destroyed the poppy plantations in the region. Since 
then, the cultivation of this plant has reportedly been 
concentrated in the south, where the armed struggle broke out. 
  It is possible that other elements--ethnic, ideological, or 
social--influenced the materialization of the revolt, but it is 
already a well-known fact that drug traffickers usually arm and 
finance these types of operations, because in order to develop 
their drug production schemes they must operate in territories 
that are outside the control of national governments. Drug 
trafficking prospers where there is chaos, where there is no 
law, and where the law of the strongest prevails. 
  It is a general rule that drug traffickers sponsor the fight 
among local armed groups and finance all parties involved in a 
struggle wherever they go. This is what happened in Huallaga. 
Here drug traffickers financed the operations of the Shining 
Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement], and the 
work of corrupt Armed Forces and police agents. 
  In Huallaga, however, two events placed this game of 
confrontation out of balance: On the one hand, the military, as 
part of a national offensive against terrorism, were able to 
weaken the Shining Path and MRTA movements in the region, 
although without eliminating them. On the other hand, the 
control of airports by the Air Force and the shooting down of 
light airplanes forced many drug traffickers to look for better 
places in the central jungle and in the south of the country. 
  One of these places, for instance, was Palmapampa, in the 
Apurimac River valley, in Ayacucho. Here peasant patrols, or at 
least some of their leaders, who had heroically defeated the 
Shining Path, became the armed guards of drug traffickers. 
These peasant patrols no longer see any advantage to the total 
elimination of the Shining Path. Otherwise, how would they 
justify their operation? Besides, some officers in the Armed 
Forces fell into the hands of the zone's corruption network. 
Here we see again how drug trafficking stirs up internal 
conflicts and corrupt people to create chaos, in the midst of 
which it then reigns. 
  Over the past few years the Army has given weapons to the 
peasant patrols in coca-producing areas--or potential 
coca-producing areas--within the framework of the 
anti-subversive struggle, creating, as a result, the potential 
for future armed uprisings in the area. Even more so now that 
peasants have begun to cultivate poppies--the raw material for 
the production of heroin, a product that has a growing market in 
the United States--in Cajamarca and Amazonas, areas that are 
higher and closer to their potential market. 
  Drug trafficking is very serious for many reasons. But one 
of those reasons--perhaps the most important one--is this: It 
sponsors the perpetuation of internal wars and corrupts the 
forces of order in order to keep a large part of the territory 
out of the reach of law and government control. It is, 
therefore, an element that goes essentially against national 
sovereignty and constitutes, without a doubt, a serious 
challenge to our national security. 
  The problem, therefore, is not simple, and the government 
does not always give it the importance it deserves. A few 
months ago we had the impression that the government would give 
priority to the fight against drug trafficking. But in the end, 
and perhaps also due to the DEA's withdrawal, the initiative did 
not materialize. The government also announced a plan to control 
the supply of precursors to producing areas--which is relatively 
simple--but which as far as we know was not implemented, either. 
  The Armed Forces internal reform program must also be 
implemented, among other things, to be able to increase 
officers' salaries to prevent corruption. 
  In general terms, we need an overall plan that will permit 
us 
to confront the problem from all angles. We also have the 
problem of money laundering, and it should be one of the topics 
in the agenda of the national call for unity announced a few 
days ago.

  [Text] Another ship said to be registered under the flag of 
St Vincent and the Grenadians, has been caught with drugs. 
According to a CANA report, Police in Britain say that they 
seized 2.7 tonnes of cannabis worth 6.5 million pounds sterling 
that were reportedly traced to the Vincentian registered ship. 
  On Saturday 14th last, Customs officers assisted by the Navy 
arrested seven people including a woman on board the mothership 
Poseidon, a one-thousand tonne vessel registered in St Vincent, 
about 100 miles off the West Coast of Ireland. 
  A Customs spokesman said then that a further 3 tonnes of 
cannabis is thought to be concealed aboard the Poseidon. 
  Reports also say that some 18 people have been arrested in 
connection with this latest haul. 
  Checks with the local Registrar of Shipping have not 
revealed 
that the ship is registered here. But in view of what Labour 
Party Leader Stalky John said recently in another case is the 
practice for frequent name changes to be made, this is not 
surprising. 
  Further, the details of changes made at the office in Monaco 
are not sent on quickly to St Vincent for the local records to 
be updated. 
  About a week ago a locally owned and registered ship was 
caught with cocaine in Grenada's waters. 
  In August another Vincentian registered ship, the Alexandra 
was arrested in Canada with 30 tonnes of hashish.

  [Text] Foreign missions in Trinidad and Tobago have come 
together to assist the Government in tackling the illicit drug 
trade. 
  Officials at the French Embassy, the UK High Commission, the 
US Embassy and the Canadian High Commission said last week that 
they hold ad hoc, informal meetings to consider the requirements 
of the T&amp;T Government and how best they can each serve these 
needs. 
  The objective of these meetings, they say, is to exchange 
information so that projects are co-ordinated and to ensure that 
efforts are not duplicated. 
  The French have been identified as the experts on money 
laundering, the Canadians on training and equipment, the US on 
drug interdiction and the British on training. 
  Jacques Venne, delegate for the Eastern Caribbean Technical 
and International Police Co-operation (SCTIP) attached to the 
French Embassy, said that Trinidad and Tobago was designated the 
regional centre of SCTIP operations on September 27. Director of 
SCTIP (International) Jean-Louise Ottavi visited for the opening 
on his way to Aruba to attend an Interpol Conference. 
  This country, he said, was chosen because of its 
geographical 
location and because of this Government's interest in dealing 
with the illicit drug trade. The Jamaican office, he added, was 
closed in favour of reinforcing the newly-opened centre in 
Trinidad and Tobago. 
  The Paris Government, he said, has already released "a good 
budget" for training a special team of police officers in money 
laundering, starting from the end of October. The officers are 
expected to undergo an intensive training session in Martinique. 
  Emphasising that his Embassy offers assistance on the basis 
of discussions with this Government, Venne said: "We are here as 
advisers, not to say what to do." 
  Head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Lance Selman 
pointed out that the Customs and Excise Division as well as the 
banking sector needed to be educated about money laundering. 
"One can't talk of counter-narcotics and not money laundering. 
In the final analysis it is money that drives the trade," he 
commented. 
  His office, Selman said, has been mandated to develop the 
capabilities to deal with money laundering. 
  Stating that his country's contribution has been "very 
modest" to date, Canadian High Commissioner Jean Nadeau said on 
Friday that Canada has been offering participation in short-term 
observer/attendance programmes. These exercises, he explained, 
involved exposure to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in their 
drug control operations. 
  Two T&amp;T officers will be attending such a session later 
this 
month. Besides training sessions, Nadeau said, Canada has 
donated a small amount of communications equipment to the 
Ministry of National Security and has made a financial 
commitment to assist in the renovation of the Narcotics Unit. 
  Indirectly, the Canadian Government has also provided 
assistance to Trinidad and Tobago, he said, through a 1992 
contribution of Can$800,000 to the Inter-American Drug Control 
Commission (CICAD) and Can$2.5 million to the United Nations 
International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). 
  Canada, said Nadeau, is also discussing with Trinidad and 
Tobago the setting up [of] a communications trunking system 
linking the protective services and perhaps Customs and Excise. 
  Press officer at the British High Commission Simon Bond said 
that the UK is placing emphasis on training especially in money 
laundering within the Customs and Excise Division. 
  "In the past we have given small-scale material assistance 
to 
the police and Coast Guard. But more significant from the UK's 
point of view is training. We also give advice in terms of 
legislative drafting in the drug area," Bond said. 
  Besides donating vehicles and equipment to the protective 
services, the US Government in August funded a US$18,000 drug 
prevention programme aimed at young people.

<F P=106> [Article by Camini Marajh: "Dirty Dollar Floats and Gets </F>
Clean"] 
  [Text] Dirty drug money got laundered in the rush of 
deposits made to commercial banks following government's 
decision to liberalise foreign exchange dealings last April. 
  Banking and law enforcement authorities last week conceded 
that dirty money did enter the banks' washing machine. 
Officials, however, attributed blame to what they say are gaping 
loopholes in existing regulations--mainly the failure of banks 
to share information, the failure to freeze accounts pending an 
enquiry to determine the source of income and the introduction 
by some banks of "exemption lists of preferred clients." 
  Preferred customers are not required to sign the necessary 
declaration forms for deposits exceeding TT$10,000 per 
individual and TT$40,000 per company. 
  Bankers, moving independently of government, last November 
signed a money laundering agreement making it mandatory for 
employees to report suspicious deposits, sale of travellers 
cheques and wire transfers. These reports must be made to the 
Office of Strategic Services (OSS), headed by Lance Selman. 
  Several bankers, requesting anonymity, said they have not 
only reported suspicious transactions to the authorities but 
have turned down accounts, some well over TT$10 million. 
  Victor Mouttet, a commercial and retail manager at Republic 
Bank, who monitors banking records on a daily basis, said 
Republic lost two substantial accounts this year because it 
demanded transparency records from the depositors in question. 
  One individual account was in the vicinity of $200,000 to 
$300,000 and the other, he said, was by a company in the sum of 
TT$10 million. 
  Mouttet said reports were made to the authorities but 
Republic has had no feedback on where the investigation, if any 
had been undertaken, has led to. 
  "We just go as far as putting them (police) on notice," he 
said in an interview last week. 
  Nearly all of the six commercial banks said they have 
reported suspicious transactions to the police but checks with 
the authorities revealed that there has been not a single arrest 
related to money laundering or questionable deposits. 
  Deputy Commissioner of Crime Selwyn confirmed that there 
have been no drug laundering arrests. He said if there is an 
investigation underway, he is unaware of it. 
  The November 1992 agreement, which is self-regulatory, 
depends entirely on bankers' discretion to report the movement 
of large deposits or transactions to law enforcement authorities. 
  Bankers themselves said the agreement is difficult to 
police. 
Some said they don't know when they should make a report. They 
said it was difficult, if not, "indelicate" to subject everyone 
including known and trusted customers to transparency 
requirements, particularly "eminent" and "respected" business 
people. 
  Big name business clients, they said, often make large 
deposits of varying sums of money and are annoyed by attempts to 
establish transparency. 
  Bankers and law enforcement authorities were reluctant to 
give even a rough estimate as to how much dirty money they 
suspect were laundered following liberalisation of foreign 
exchange controls. 
  Finance Minister Wendell Mottley, in a post-floating of the 
TT currency address to a PNM party meeting in May, said that 
"millions and millions of U.S. dollars which had been stored in 
jars, pitchoil tins, safety deposit mattresses and in pillows" 
found its way into the commercial banking system. Bankers, 
however, say the majority of this money--about TT$80 
million--included the return of capital flight. 
  Suresh Maharaj, managing director of Citibank, said his bank 
has lost accounts because of requests for information on the 
source of deposits. 
  He, however, noted that Citibank, in addition to local 
banking regulations, is subject to stringent US controls and 
checks by US Federal Reserve Inspectors. 
  Some bankers said less ill-gotten gains are entering the 
banking system and are in fact being traded on the open market 
for the purpose of luxury items such as cars, real estate, 
jewelry and pleasure boats. 
  Asked whether the illegal money would not enter the banking 
system at some point in time--either by the car dealer or real 
estate agent, assuming they are paid in cash--one banker said: 
"Yes," but noted that "it may be that the bank is in the habit 
of handling large cash deposits from a particular car dealer so, 
no, a large cash deposit may not necessarily arouse suspicion or 
be reported to anyone." 
  Frank Mouttet, President of the Chamber of Commerce said he 
was not at all satisfied with the present drug money laundering 
regulations. 
  Attorney Douglas Mendes says it is not enough to just ask 
the 
banks to divulge information on the movement of currency, 
transfers and deposits over a certain sum. 
  He said law enforcers should be given the authority to 
freeze 
accounts until they are able to determine the source of income 
and whether taxes have been paid on it. 
  Tom Cash, special agent of the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration Miami Office with responsibility for the 
Caribbean, said last month that attempts by the DEA to follow 
the trail of laundered drug money have been frustrated by the 
failure of banking officials to volunteer information. 
  The DEA office last year captured US$279 million from drug 
raids and busted money laundering activities in the Miami 
district alone. Cash said this figure could have been 
significantly higher had there been more co-operation from 
banking officials. 
  He said it was the DEA experience that assurances made by 
bankers to volunteer information was a myth and warned that 
governments should watch closely bankers who declare that they 
don't need regulatory laws. Cash named bankers and lawyers as 
the people who profit most from drug money laundering. 
  Bankers countercharged that if blame is to be apportioned it 
should be laid at the door of law enforcement authorities. 
  Bankers argued that the authorities know who the dealers are 
but for their own private reasons prefer to shake down "the 
small fellas on the block."

<F P=106> [Article by Camini Marajh: "Drug Bust Mystery: Why Always </F>
Abroad?"] 
  [Text] Local law enforcers have denied that there is an 
unwritten policy to have arrests and seizures of drugs coming 
from Trinidad and Tobago take place outside this country's 
territory. 
  Still, no one could say why all of the major drug busts with 
clear Trinidad and Tobago connections are taking place 
everywhere--in Savannah, Georgia; Wilmington, North Carolina; 
Frankfurt, Germany, and on Monday in Grenada--but here. 
  Repeated calls to National Security Minister Russell Huggins 
and Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Chief Lance Selman went 
unreturned up to late Friday. 
  Law enforcement sources said in both shipping 
incidents--involving the methanol tanker Harold La 
Borde and the schooner Let Me Live--local police 
had prior knowledge that there were drugs on board. A combined 
total of 134 kilograms of cocaine were seized from both vessels 
in places outside Trinidad and Tobago. 
  The Ministry of National Security has gone a step further 
and 
rushed to take credit for the drug busts, citing collaboration 
between local authorities and their foreign counterparts in an 
official government press release. 
  Despite this, no one could say why, if information was 
available that there were drugs on board the methanol tanker and 
on the inter-island schooner, the bust was not made here by 
local narcotics or Coast Guard officers, instead of allowing the 
US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Grenada Coast 
Guard to break those two smuggling operations. 
  In the case of the Harold La Borde the DEA gave 
credit to a local informant who was paid "good money" by the US 
counter-narcotics agency for supplying information that led to 
the drug bust and the arrest of four Trinidadians. 
  Pierre Sharette, assistant special agent of the DEA Miami 
office with responsibility for the Caribbean, told the SUNDAY 
EXPRESS that month that the mystery Trinidadian had no 
connection to law enforcement agencies. 
  Current bids for credit by local officials recall the 
episode 
two years ago when the Narcotics Bureau claimed credit for the 
Florida arrest by US authorities of Paul Mansoor with five 
kilograms of cocaine. 
  Vexed by the false claim, a US source later told this 
newspaper that Mansoor was picked up in Miami because he was 
acting suspicously, and not as a result of any tip-off from the 
T&amp;T police. 
  Sources say that neither of the shipping incidents was a 
"controlled delivery"--the reason, some people believe, for the 
failure of local authorities to act on the information here. 
  In the latest bust, local authorities said, they tipped off 
the DEA, who in turn alerted the Grenada Coast Guard that drugs 
were stashed in hidden compartments in furniture stored on the 
schooner. Why local authorities did not themselves intercept the 
drugs but allowed the ship to leave the Caricom jetty and sail 
clear out of T&amp;T waters has not been explained. 
  A top policeman would say only that "we were aware of it 
(drugs on board the schooner)." Pressed further, he said: "The 
information is very sensitive." 
  He claimed that authorities here "are aware of the local 
connection" in both drug runs. He added only that: "We have an 
idea what's going on (in the drug business)." 
  He refused to say why, if the authorities know who the local 
dealers are, there have been no arrests as yet--or rather, the 
arrests that have been made comprise mainly drug mules held on 
outbound flights at Piarco International Airport and low-level 
street dealers. 
  Earlier this month, a Trinidadian was arrested in Germany 
with four kilograms of cocaine. He was a passenger on BWIA 
flight 980--Port of Spain to Frankfurt. 
  Suspicions created since charges last year about a police 
"drug cartel" have slowed the sharing of information even 
between the newly created narcotics unit and Selman's OSS. Each 
agency is reported to be guarding information jealously and 
sharing it "on a need to know basis only." 
  There is no explanation either why there are no busts for 
drugs coming into Trinidad and Tobago, or how much of 
what comes in remains here. 
  Law enforcement authorities say they are unable to keep pace 
with the sophisticated craft and ingenious methods employed by 
traffickers and predict even tougher times ahead with the major 
shift in US drug policy. 
  The Clinton administration announced it will slash drug 
interdictions efforts using warships and aircraft in the 
Caribbean and pump more aid to South America to fight cocaine at 
the source. 
  Sharette had told the SUNDAY EXPRESS that Trinidad and 
Tobago 
is being used as a "staging area" by the Medellin and Cali 
cartels to move drugs to Europe and North America. 
  Sharette said DEA intelligence indicates that single and 
twin-engine aircraft have been making drug airdrops in Trinidad 
and Tobago territorial waters. Boats pick up the drug cargo for 
repackaging and shipping to Europe and North America. 
  Meanwhile, despite Huggins' vow to get tough, cocaine 
cartels 
continue to bring their drugs into Trinidad and Tobago and, as 
evidenced by recent seizures and arrests, to take at least some 
of it out.

  [Text] A Trinidadian drug cartel involving hundreds of 
millions of dollars worth of cocaine in monthly shipments 
between Colombia and the United States and Britain via Trinidad 
has been broken in Venezuela with the arrest of its leader on a 
beach in the mainland republic. 
  George Simeon, leader of a cartel called "Los Trinitarios" 
(The Trinidadians), was captured on the beach in Sucre State as 
he received samples of what General Julio C. Pena Sanchez of the 
Venezuelan Guardia Nacional described as a future shipment of 
high quality cocaine. 
  The cartel was said to have been shipping between 500 and 
1,000 kilos of cocaine, worth between TT$175 and TT$350 million, 
monthly from Colombia through Venezuela via Trinidad to points 
in the Caribbean and North Atlantic. 
  The arrest of the group was the leading item in Venezuela's 
largest-selling newspaper, EL NACIONAL last Wednesday. Simeon, a 
Trindadian, was arrested along with other members of the cartel 
who were held simultaneously in other parts of the country in a 
massive Guardia Nacional exercise which also resulted in the 
seizure of six vehicles. 
  General Pena Sanchez, Operations Commander of the Guardia 
Nacional, announced the arrests last Tuesday, following the 
events which occurred on Saturday, November 6. 
  He said the arrests had been the result of seven months of 
investigations and surveillance by the joint armed forces aimed 
at breaking the cartel, which was based in Maracaibo in Zulia 
state and had a network which spread across several states in 
Venezuela. 
  A total of 165 officers of the Guardia Nacional took part in 
the raid which captured Simeon and a Venezuelan national on the 
Sucre beach. Other members of the drug network were captured in 
Maracaibo, Zulia, Acarigua, Portuguesa and Rio Caribe. The 
Guardia Nacional has traced the drug route from Cali, Cucuta, 
Colombia; to Urena, Tachira, Acarigua, Carupano, Sucre and Rio 
Caribe in Venezuela, and then to Trinidad. 
  Since then, in an apparently unrelated case, another 
Trinidadian, Wharfe Ashton, Alton, has been arrested on drug 
trafficking charges after the intelligence arm of the police 
service monitored a drug shipment bound for Miami. Alton was 
shot in the leg as he tried to escape. 
  The big Venezuelan drug bust is the second major report in a 
week involving the discovery of multi-million drug operations in 
which Trinidadians were implicated. 
  Grenada Coast Guard intercepted an inter-island vessel on 
November 5, the same day of the Venezuelan operations, and 
found 60 kilos of cocaine hidden in a cargo of furniture. The 
boat had left Port of Spain the afternoon before. An Arima man, 
Sylvon Liverpool, was arrested together with five others.

  [Editorial Report] Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in 
Spanish on 14 January publishes on page 25 an unattributed 
500-word article on the results of a study on drug consumption 
among youngsters. 
  The article says that a study released by the National Board 
for the Prevention of the Illegal Traffic and Excessive Use of 
Drugs conducted in April 1993 reports that "8 percent of the 
economically active population between 15 and 29 years of age 
consume marijuana regularly, another 2 percent are addicted to 
cocaine, and 10 percent are alcoholic." 
  The article also points out that a high percentage of 
teachers and professors regularly consume pharmaceutical drugs. 
  The article notes that the National Board points out that 
"20 
percent of the youngsters questioned said they had been offered 
marijuana, and 7 percent said they had been offered cocaine." 
  The article concludes by saying that the National Board has 
been created to coordinate the work of several ministries and to 
propose policies.

  [Text] THAI RAT correspondents went to Shan State to 
interview Khun Sa, who was surrounded by his armed security 
guards. For the first time, he made known his wish to quit 
being the number-one drug kingpin. He has appealed to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to help 
the Shan State become heroin-free, instead of spending large 
sums of money on drug suppression. 
  The interview with the Drug Warlord Khun Sa or Chang Si-fu, 
took place after the drug kingpin, who declared himself 
president of the Shan State Restoration Council, sent his close 
aide to contact THAI RAT. Khun Sa said he wished to tell the 
world about the present situation in Shan State, once a major 
heroin production center. He wished to make known to the world 
that the Shan State is now heroin-free. He added that he wanted 
the U.S. president to assist the Shan State in this way instead 
of dumping huge amounts of money into drug suppression. 
  THAI RAT correspondents left with Khun Sa's men for an 
interview with the drug kingpin. They went north by car for 
about 75 kilometers from the Thai-Burmese border in Mae Hong Son 
Province passing ridges and forests. At 1245 on 20 January, 
they arrived in Shan State where they met Khun Sa, a 60-years 
old man whose Thai name is Chan Changtrakun. He was wearing a 
white shirt, a green-colored field jacket, and blue trousers. 
He had about ten bodyguards with him and they arrived in a 
minitruck. Khun Sa invited reporters to a house in the middle 
of the forest where he receives guests. 
  Then the interview began. Chang Si-fu, the most-wanted drug 
kingpin with a huge ransom on his head, told THAI RAT that he 
would like countries playing a major role in narcotics 
suppression to know that he has given up all narcotics-related 
activities, and that he wants the Shan State under him to become 
heroin-free. He asked THAI RAT to relay this message to Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai, and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Khun Sa said that whenever a drug crime was committed, 
people 
would point their fingers at him and accuse him of being the 
source of the drugs. He said that he has closed off the 
trafficking route. Opium products peddled to the outside world 
now come from another area close to Shan State where production 
amounted to some 6,000 tons annually. He admitted that he 
received a toll on those products. Now that other routes are 
being used in heroin trafficking, he said he is not earning any 
money and is short of funds to support the eight million people 
in Shan State. 
  "The United Nations did not pay us any attention. We need 
help in the training of jobs that are different from opium 
growing. Shan State is rich in mineral resources. We have 
forests and blue sapphires. I want the world to be fair to the 
Shan people. I want Shan State to be heroin-free. But I don't 
know who is going to believe me. If the Thai prime minister 
considers this an important issue, he should then coordinate 
with the U.S. president," he said. 
  Khun Sa said the Thai Government could turn the Golden 
Triangle into an opium-free zone. If the Thai Government offers 
him cooperation, Thailand would become the first country to 
successfully close off the trafficking route in which Thailand 
is a transit point. He said he is willing to open up Shan State 
for investment, trade, and tourism. And as drought is a problem 
that plagues Thailand annually, he is willing to let the Thai 
Government divert water from the Salween River for the Thai 
people. 
  "If Thailand and the United States are sincere about 
narcotics suppression at the Golden Triangle, this is a good 
opportunity because I have quit and I am ready for visits and 
inspections from every party, in exchange for development of the 
Shan State. We want to have legitimate contact with the outside 
world," Khun Sa said.

  [Excerpt] Khun Sa, president of the Shan State Restoration 
Council, spoke in an exclusive interview with PHUCHATKAN. He 
said that he sent letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in October and asked for 
cooperation from the United States, the United Nations, and the 
Thai Government for his efforts to stop opium growing and heroin 
production in the Shan State. Khun Sa, or Chang Si-fu in 
Chinese, during the interview from his stronghold in the central 
town of the Shan state which is opposite Thailand's Mae Hong Son 
Province, said that as far as he knew, President Clinton had 
forwarded the matter to the Thai prime minister and asked the 
latter to study ways to assist the Thai Yai ethnic people in 
Shan State to stop growing poppies. Khun Sa said of his bid to 
lobby for financial funding that he did not have much hope that 
there would be any assistance from international organizations 
because most organizations only have tried to paint a negative 
picture of him as an international outlaw. 
  Khun Sa, however, did not entirely dismiss a chance for 
success for his crop replacement plan for the Shan State. He 
said the campaign to reduce poppy growing and finally root out 
opium cultivation in Shan State will materialize within five 
years if there is money for him to implement the crops 
replacement plan and vocational training projects. Most 
importantly, he said, the Burmese military government must also 
stop supporting poppy growing and heroin production. He said: 
"If opium growing is eliminated in Shan State while Burma 
continues to allow it, the Thai Yai people in Shan State will be 
forced to run away and join with Burmese troops so that they can 
continue to make a living by growing poppies." [passage omitted 
on Khun Sa's political goals]

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai spoke with newsmen on 
23 January while on an inspection trip to Phetchabun Province 
about the proposal of Khun Sa, a world-renowned narcotics king 
and Shan State leader, for Thailand to help the Shan State 
become a narcotics-free zone. He said the Khun Sa question is 
Burma's business, not Thailand's. He added that Thailand cannot 
become involved in the issue. 
  In an earlier interview, Khun Sa said he wanted to create a 
heroin-free zone in Shan State. He urged Thai Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai to coordinate with U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
pushing for a realization of the zone in order to avoid having 
to set aside funds for narcotics suppression. The purpose of 
Khun Sa's move is to gain the international community's 
recognition of the Shan State as an independent territory. Khun 
Sa asserted that the Shan State Government under his leadership 
has not supported opium cultivation; however, it has not been 
able to prevent its people from engaging in such cultivation.

  [Summary] On 24 December the ROK National Maritime Police 
seized 20 kg of cocaine, worth an estimated $50 million, off a 
freighter undergoing periodic repairs at the Hyundai Mipo 
Dockyard in Ulsan. Police began searching the 
Panamanian-registered Sunny Ocean on 22 December after receiving 
a tipoff. Two days later they found 20 kg of cocaine stored in 
two plastic containers hidden in a seawater intake port. Police 
are investigating 13 Korean crew members, including the ship's 
captain, Kim Chun-ung. Authorities think that the crew was 
asked by a foreign drug-smuggling organization to transport 
South American cocaine, and that they intended to deliver it to 
a drug-trafficking group in the South Korea-Japan region. 
Police commented that the cocaine was more likely intended for 
a third country, because the amount of cocaine involved is 
enormous when compared to the size of the ROK cocaine market. 
The freighter is owned by the Kitaura-kai [transliterated] 
Ocean Shipping Company of Japan, and travels mainly between 
Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Argentina, Uruguay, and 
Brazil. It was returning to Japan after visiting Brazil, 
Argentina, and Hong Kong when it docked at Ulsan on 21 December 
to undergo periodic repairs.

<F P=106> [By Roy C. Sinfuego] </F>
  [Text] The Philippines has become a major transshipment 
point for international drug trafficking because of its 
proximity to the Golden Triangle, the major source of heroin and 
opium in the world. 
  Drug trafficking in the country, particularly Metro Manila 
and other urban centers, has also developed into a billion peso 
mega-business, according to the Narcotics Command (Narcom) under 
the Philippine National Police (PNP). 
  Narcom Director Ramsey Ocampo, in briefing four visiting 
officers of the National Police Agency of Japan (NPAJ) at Camp 
Crame yesterday, estimated that some 300 drug syndicates with 
about 3,000 active members catering to about 600,000 drug users. 
  The NPAJ group, which is here on a drug-related police 
coordinating mission is composed of Chief Superintendent Yukata 
Takahena, director of the drug control division and leader of 
the team, and Superintendents Osamu Murashita, Kenichi Tadokoro 
and Hiroshi Sawanobon. 
  Senior Superintendent Ocampo described as "disturbing" the 
drug trafficking situation in the country, primarily because it 
has also become the major source and exporter of marijuana to 
many parts of the world. 
  He admitted that the drug menace has remained despite the 
relentless and aggressive campaign waged by the PNP and other 
law-enforcement agencies as well as the active involvement of 
religious and civic groups which has achieved modest success in 
1993. 
  Ocampo told the NPAJ officers that his command shifted its 
drive from street operations to a more vigorous campaign against 
the druglords and pushers, resulting in the arrest of 60 big 
time drug traffickers through "Operation Thunderbolt" last year. 
  International drug trafficking is dominated by drug 
syndicates operating from Taiwan and Hong Kong which supply the 
popular "shabu" [methaphetamine hydrochloride] to the Philippine 
drug market. 
  Takahena and his group were accorded honors upon their 
arrival at the PNP general headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon 
City. A parade was held by a special police battalion and 
Senior Superintendent Benjamin Advincula, PNP chief of protocol 
and foreign liaison escorted the visitors.

  [Text] All Thai drug suppression units must prepare for 
hard work as opium production in the Golden Triangle under 
control of drug warlord Khun Sa reportedly hit a record of at 
least 3,500 tons at the end of last year, Pol Lt-Gen Kowit 
Phakdiphum, the former commissioner of the Narcotics Suppression 
Bureau warned yesterday. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit, who has recently been promoted to 
assistant 
police chief, said that Khun Sa would try to refine the raw 
opium into heroin and traffic the illicit drug to markets abroad 
as soon as possible as he needed a large amount of money to buy 
weapons and food supplies to fight Burmese troops. 
  "Thailand would have to take the heavy burden of cracking 
down on drug traffickers to save the world from narcotics." 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit said Thai officials must increase 
cooperation with representatives of 14 countries in Asia, Europe 
and North America now working at their embassies on drug 
prevention and suppression campaigns. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit yesterday bade farewell to his subordinates 
at the Narcotics Suppression Bureau as he was about to leave for 
the North this week to oversee the operations of Police Region 5 
which covers Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Mae Hong Son, Lamphun, 
Lamphang, Payao, Nan and Phrae. 
  His successor, Pol Lt-Gen Somchai Milindarangkun, would go 
on 
with a plan to jointly set up a hotline centre on narcotics 
suppression with China. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit said he would join the delegation of Deputy 
Prime Minister Amnuay Wirawan to Rangoon on February 9 for the 
second meeting of Thailand, Laos and Burma on drug suppression. 
  The first meeting was held in Bangkok in 1992.

  [Excerpt] Police Lieutenant Colonel Hiran Chattrakun, the 
chief inspector at the Chiang Mai provincial police station in 
Mae Ping Subdistrict, Muang District, learned that a gang of 
narcotics traffickers was going to transport a shipment of 
heroin from Chiang Mai Province for delivery to a customer in 
Phayao Province. They were going to board a bus at the Chiang 
Mai Ah Khet bus station. Thus, he ordered Police Lieutenant 
Colonel Leophong Chiamkarakit, the inspector for investigation, 
Police Captain Suwit Luanprasoet, the deputy inspector for 
investigation, and a team of officials to conduct an 
investigation. Police 1st Lieutenant Sirimon Wisutthikun, the 
deputy inspector for investigation and coordination, was ordered 
to go see Mr. Thanongkiat Chimphli, the head of the northern 
ONCB [Office of the Narcotics Control Board] unit, and obtain 
his cooperation in arresting the traffickers. 
  At 0830 hours on 1 November 1993, police and ONCB officials 
concealed themselves around the Ah Khet bus station. At that 
moment, a man dressed in a military uniform carrying a satchel 
started to board the Chiang Mai-Phayao bus. He fit the 
description provided by a police informer and so the officials 
conducted a search and arrested him. When the police searched 
the satchel, they found four bags of Tiger and Globe brand 
heroin weighing 1,440 grams. The suspect was identified as 
Sergeant Ranaphum Phrabun, age 30, who lives at 115 Village 8, 
Nong Faek Subdistrict, Saraphi District, Chiang Mai Province. He 
was stationed at the provincial army base in Phayao Province. 
  During the interrogation, Sergeant Ranaphum said that a 
merchant, name unknown, had paid him 2,000 baht to deliver the 
heroin to a customer in Bangkok. But he was going to go to 
Phayao Province first before delivering the heroin to the 
customer in Bangkok. He had been paid the 2,000 baht in advance. 
After delivering the heroin, he was supposed to be paid an 
additional amount, but he did not know how much. The merchant 
who hired him had told him that he had purchased the heroin in 
Fang District, Chiang Mai Province. He asked him to serve as a 
courier because he was a soldier. The man thought that that 
would be more convenient than hiring a civilian. But he was 
arrested. This was the first time that he had tried to transport 
narcotics. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At 0200 hours on 6 December 1993, Police Lieutenant 
Colonel Samphan Inthai, the commander of Border Patrol Police 
[BPP] Company 226 in Phibun Mangsahan District, Ubon Ratchathani 
Province, Police Captain Sakda Tochongmon, the deputy company 
commander, and Police 2d Lieutenant Singkhon Samakkhun, the 
commander of "CK" Company 225, set up a checkpoint near the 
headquarters of the Huai Tat Ton Forest Preserve Unit along the 
Ban Woembuk Nikhom 2 highway. A blue Datsun sedan, license No 
2K-4255 Bangkok, stopped at the checkpoint. The people in the 
car looked suspicious and so the officials conducted a search. 
They found 38 sticks of dried marijuana wrapped in newspaper and 
clear plastic. Each stick weighed 1 kg for a total of 38 kg. The 
marijuana had been packed in a sea bag and concealed in the rear 
seat. The suspects were identified as Mr. Chanti Songsoem, age 
30, who lives at 67/1 Sisaket Road, Warin Chamrap Subdistrict, 
Warin Chamrap District, Ubon Ratchathani Province, and Mr. Sanit 
Bunchak, age 36, who lives at 43 Thetsaban 58 Road, Warin 
Chamrap District, Ubon Ratchathani Province. 
  During interrogation, the two suspects said that Sergeant 
Chatchawan, surname unknown, had hired them to transport 
marijuana at 1,000 baht per kg. They had already made four 
trips. They had purchased the marijuana in Chong Chiam District 
at a cost of 500 baht per kg. The suspects were taken and turned 
over to Police 1st Lieutenant Wanchai Ruangsi, the duty officer 
at the provincial police station in Sirinthon District, for 
further handling of the case.

<F P=106> [By M.K. Dhar] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, 11 Jan -- Pakistan's continued 
interference in the internal situation in Afghanistan and the 
guns-for-drugs policy of its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) 
is a major factor contributing to renewed outbreak of civil war 
in Afghanistan. 
  Most countries, including India, having been forced to 
vacate 
their missions in Kabul. Details are available, through 
diplomatic sources, of the extent of outside interference and 
the part played by the drug barons with disastrous consequences 
for the war-ravaged country which is finding it impossible to 
return to normalcy. 
  India, like other countries, had reopened its mission in 
Kabul after the Jalalabad accord as a result of which Prof. 
Borhanoddin Rabbani was installed President and Mr. Golboddin 
Hekmatyar as Prime Minister. During the U.S-backed anti-Soviet 
operations in Afghanistan, Mr. Hekmatyar operated entirely from 
Pakistan territory and in the installation of the 
Rabbani-Hekmatyar team, the Pakistanis and the Saudis felt 
confident that a regime which would be dictated to by them had 
been put in place. 
  Most countries now seem to feel that outside interference in 
Afghanistan's internal affairs, including arms supplies the 
Mojahedin groups, must stop and the people should be allowed to 
take charge of their affairs and elect their representatives on 
the basis of a national consensus. 
  Despite Pakistan's backing, Mr. Hekmatyar was unable to 
function and could not even open his office for fear of 
retaliation by Ahmad Shah Mas'ud whom he had ousted from the 
interim Government. 
  With Mas'ud and the Uzbek General Dostam having been pushed 
out, many countries, including India, had doubted whether the 
Jalalabad accord would last. They were proved right and Prime 
Minister Hekmatyar, who has not been officially dismissed by 
President Rabbani so far despite his having staged a coup 
against him, has joined forces with his arch rival General 
Dostam who has several thousand men in arms in the northern 
region. 
  India shares the concern of the international community at 
the deterioration in the situation in Afghanistan and feels that 
a genuine reconciliation must take place and forces of 
stabilisation, instead of fundamentalism, should be encouraged 
to take charge of affairs and helped materially to undertake the 
task of economic reconstruction. 
  Under the Jalalabad accord, President Rabbani and commanders 
from all 29 provinces were supposed to elect a Defence Minister 
by 22 July last, but this did not happen and Mr. Mas'ud began 
mobilising the Pathans for an assault on all centres of power. 
Mr. Hekmatyar's efforts to wean away his followers did not 
succeed and with the U.S. having called off its Afghanistan 
operation, huge sums of money which were once channelled through 
Pakistan were no longer available. 
  Another factor is the prospect of the Pathans, who 
constitute 
about 45 per cent of the country's population losing their 
dominance in all walks of life. It is also obvious that the 
self-willing people of Afghanistan who have always fought for 
their independence, are unwilling to accept the rigidities of 
Islamic fundamentalism which are sought to be imposed on them by 
several countries which spent considerable sums of money to 
finance the war against the Soviets and, later, President 
Najibollah. 
  With itself fully involved in drug trafficking to raise 
resources for financing insurgency in other countries, the ISI 
encouraged the drugs trade which had got disrupted during the 
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. 
  The Soviet occupation disrupted old smuggling routes between 
Afghanistan and Europe via Iran, Turkey and across the 
Iran-Soviet border. These routes were patronised by itinerant 
Afghans who traded in everything. The cutting up of these 
routes deflected much of this trade South and East to Pakistan. 
The Herati traders no longer went to Mashhad, but southeast to 
Qandahar and Quetta, south along desert tracks to transhipment 
point in Balochistan and near the Afghanistan-Pakistan-lran 
trijunction. 
  The major border tribals--Wazir, Masud, Bhattani, Mangal, 
Bangash, Orakzai, Afridi, Mohmand, Tarklarnri, Utman Khel--live 
under their own war-like code of Pakhtunwali, still regard 
themselves as free peoples, and remain adept at playing 
Islamabad and Kabul off against each other. They continue to 
resist the slow processes of the integration with Pakistan, 
although younger Khans recognise that their desire for 
electricity, roads and services (education and medicine) will 
make them more dependent on the Government. The Afghanistan 
conflict, during which most Pakhtuns supported the Afghan 
Mojahedin, offered limited opportunities to play Kabul off 
against Islamabad although the Afridis and Mohmands did try to 
manipulate the conflict to protect their crossborder smuggling 
and heroin interests. 
  The ISI has financed insurgency not only in Afghanistan 
(where the operation was backed by the U.S.), but also in 
Kashmir with disastrous consequences. President Rabbani has 
been forced to appeal to several countries to come to his rescue 
by condemning the coup in all international forums.

  [Text] Jammu, Jan. 14 (UNI) -- The Central intelligence 
agencies have been warned of possible strikes by 
Pakistan-trained militants in New Delhi and Bombay following 
reports that a number of them had infiltrated into India. 
  Intelligence sources here said interrogation of some top 
militant leaders and foreign nationals nabbed by the security 
forces revealed that the Pakistan ISI [Interservice 
Intelligence] had decided to send in trained militants from the 
coastal borders of Gujarat and the deserts of Rajasthan, instead 
of the Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab borders. The ISI is trying 
to send in armed men and weapons through these circuits in view 
of heavy snow in the high mountain passes of the Kashmir Valley 
which has made movement virtually impossible, they said. 
  The sources said the Kashmir militants and some Islamic 
militant organisations in India had established a possible base 
in Bombay where they were now trying to strike in order to 
target the country's commercial capital. The recent arrest of a 
large number of ISI men and other foreign nationals from various 
part of the country including Bombay, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and 
Rajasthan were clear indicators of the nexus between some 
overground and underworld organisations and the armed 
insurgents, they said. 
  The sources said the interrogation also revealed links 
between the ISI and Kashmiri militants with the Kerala-based 
banned Islamic Seva Sangh (ISS) and Islamic Student Sangh (ISS). 
Various fundamentalist and Islamic organisations have been 
actively supporting these anti-nationals who have established 
links with the underworld dons in Bombay and outside India. 
  The sources said there was concentrated [as published] 
effort 
by the Pakistan Army to revive the nexus between the Punjab and 
Kashmiri militants. 
  The militants were now adopting the new route of Sri 
Ganganagar in Rajasthan and the Gujarat coast to smuggle in arms 
and ammunition, the sources added. 
  Some Kashmiri woollen merchants who visit different parts of 
the country during winter to sell their goods have been found 
smuggling weapons, sophisticated wireless sets, books on 
guerrilla warfare and other subversive material on their way 
back to Kashmir. 
  The security forces and the State Police on their part have 
set up inter-border check posts to check such acts. 
  According to the sources the peaceful resolution of the 
Hazratbal [shrine] crisis had dealt a severe blow to the morale 
of the militants. It had not intensified inter-gang clashes 
among them but also made it difficult to re-group and chalk out 
fresh strategies against the security forces. [sentence as 
published] 
  Several top leaders of militant groups may have left the 
Valley to safer hideouts in view of the increased pressure by 
the security forces, they felt. 
  During the past one month, there has been a decline in 
militant killings. The sources attributed this to the general 
resentment against the militants with the local people now 
readily coming forward with information about the hideouts of 
militants. 
  The sources said recently a US House Committee report had 
revealed that the ISI had established countrywide network and 
was responsible for a series of bomb blasts in Delhi and Bombay 
in 1992. 
  The sources expressed serious concern over information that 
Nepal was being used by Kashmir, Islamic and Arab subversives to 
hold meetings to chalk out strategies. An increasing number of 
militants had fled to Nepal as the ISI is making a bid to 
establish a "jehad [holy war] council" in the Valley consisting 
of top 15 militant organisations. 
  There had also been an increase in drug-trafficking on the 
Jammu border as the Army in Pakistan had launched a major 
crackdown on drug lords in the Sindh and Balochistan Provinces. 
  An official report said terrorist outfits involved in drug 
running have been increasingly using India as a transit point. 
  The report said terrorism and insurgency with all the talk 
about "self-determination" and struggle for "independence" have 
been used by the outlawed militants outfits to provide a 
camouflage for smuggling of narcotics, bound for western 
destinations through Delhi and Bombay.

  [Text] The headquarters for a campaign against narcotics, 
in a session today chaired by Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, approved 
in general terms a draft memorandum of understanding for 
regional cooperation by Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It 
provides for a more determined campaign against narcotics under 
UN supervision. 
  At the session, the president expressed satisfaction and 
appreciation over efforts undertaken by those engaged in 
anti-narcotic operations in the country. He stressed the need 
for political and infrastructural measures including the closure 
of the eastern borders of the country, identification and 
destruction of internal narcotics production and distribution 
networks, and creation of employment and rehabilitation camps 
for addicts. 
  The commander of the law enforcement forces and the 
secretary 
to the headquarters for anti-narcotic operations announced at 
the session that during the current year [beginning 21 March 
1993] 66 tonnes of various types of narcotics have been 
uncovered and more than 53,000 production and distribution 
agents and narcotic addicts have been arrested. 
  According to a report by our correspondent, during the 
session a proposal by the governor general of Sistan va 
Baluchestan Province concerning a plan for closing the eastern 
borders was raised and the required funds for the project 
approved.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Forceful Campaign Against Drug Mafia"] </F>
  [Text] The operation against growing and smuggling 
narcotics that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has announced is 
equivalent to a jihad against the trade involving this deadly 
addiction. The prime minister has directed in the high-level 
meeting of the Anti-Narcotics Task Force to arrest all major 
narcotics smugglers at any cost, and not to accept any kind of 
political pressure in this context. Under this campaign not only 
the major crocodiles in this dirty pool will be arrested but 
cases against them will be heard in a special court. The 
government will provide all the necessary resources for this 
important campaign. The prime minister has combined all the 
small and large agencies related to drug control at the federal 
level to form an effective agency. All related officials have 
been instructed to present a special report immediately. 
  No doubt that production, trade, and smuggling of heroin is 
a 
major curse in Pakistan. While it has given a bad name to 
Pakistan at the international level, it has also poisoned our 
new generation. It is unfortunate that no government from Ziaul 
Haq to Nawaz Sharif took any effective step to end this curse. 
The main reason for this neglect was the lobbies formed by the 
drug Mafia in every political party. All the anti-narcotics laws 
were ineffective, and even in the law enforcement agencies 
responsible for curbing this curse, there were persons who 
protected the Mafia interests. However, some major narcotic 
smugglers were arrested during the caretaker government. The 
present government passed the law to give death sentences and 
confiscate property of arrested drug smugglers. Now a solid 
campaign is being launched against these death-dealers. The 
people are hoping that no major drug dealer will be able to 
escape the long arms of the law. Still, in addition to this 
legal campaign, it is important to stop poppy cultivation in 
tribal areas and to take all necessary steps to protect the 
youth from this deadly habit with the help of reform agencies. 
Special far-reaching efforts must be made to treat and 
rehabilitate the chronic addicts.

  [Text] Formal permission to amend Article 35(C) of the Drug 
Act has been given in a meeting chaired by Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto. This amendment will allow the courts to 
confiscate all land and property of drug smugglers who are 
sentenced to more than two years in jail. The Pakistan People's 
Party government has started to take action to rid the society 
of the cures of narcotics, and has decided to amend the law in 
order to confiscate property belonging to drug smugglers. This 
is a very good step, however, the big fish manage to avoid being 
caught in the present system. They free themselves with the help 
of the police. The ordinary peddlers and the dealers are 
arrested. The system should be overhauled so that the real 
criminals are caught and given exemplary punishment.

  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has approved plans to 
launch a major government operation against cultivation and 
smuggling of narcotics in the nation. She said in the high-level 
meeting of the Anti-Narcotics Task Force at her house that the 
major drug smugglers will be arrested at any cost and political 
pressure of any kind will not be accepted. As for cultivating, 
use, and smuggling of narcotics in our country, it is still on 
the rise. The situation is so serious that this trade is 
regularly protected by some circles in our country. Some members 
of the law enforcement agencies are also allegedly involved in 
it. Now they discuss political patronage for this trade openly. 
The U.S. government went as far as to say that some persons in 
the legislature are also involved in this trade. The drug trade, 
in addition to increasing the number of drug abusers, has also 
given the United States and Western nations an opportunity to 
denounce Pakistan. Our economic aid was also stopped because of 
this. There is no doubt that the "drug Mafia" in Pakistan has 
become very powerful during the last few years, and it has the 
blessings of the administration, law enforcement agencies, and 
politicians. The drug trade within the country is carried out 
under the supervision of this Mafia. Despite the efforts of 
government law enforcement agencies, heroin factories in tribal 
areas still have not been destroyed. The drugs smuggled from 
Afghanistan are available in addition to it. Although the Saudi 
government has sentenced some Pakistanis to death recently and 
also has given Pakistan a list of smugglers, the big fish of the 
Mafia has not been apprehended. The efforts to control this 
Mafia started during General Ziaul Haq's time, however, only 
minor dealers were arrested. This determination was announced by 
the governments that followed Zia, however, the drug Mafia was 
never really affected. During the caretaker government, names of 
some of the big fish were published, and a series of raids were 
started. Some of them were arrested, however, those who control 
this trade, and whom the Pakistani agencies know well, were not 
arrested. It is clear from the record that the efforts to catch 
the big fish or the drug lords have been nothing more than 
slogans. Now Madam Bhutto's government has made this 
announcement all over again. We expect that some serious work 
will be done and the proposed operation is not just paperwork.

has planned an operation to stop the growing, selling, and 
smuggling of narcotics in the nation. The prime minister has 
given approval to this plan at the Prime Minister House this 
week during the task force meeting. The operation clean up will 
be first started in federal tribal areas as opium is grown in 
these areas and the largest heroin factories in Asia where the 
most expensive heroin in the world, the Golden Heroin, is grown 
are also situated here. [sentence as published] A high-level 
meeting of officials of various agencies involved in drug 
control was hold on Sunday at the ministry of drug control. This 
meeting was attended by Dil Jan Khan, secretary of drug control 
ministry; M.I. Muhasan, chairman of Narcotics Control Board; 
Ghulam Ali, secretary of Narcotics Control Board; and other 
high-level officials of the home ministry. According to informed 
sources, the decision to start operation clean up first in 
tribal areas was made because major drug smugglers are hiding 
here and the law enforcement agencies have a difficult time in 
arresting them. It was decided in the meeting to ask for the 
cooperation of the Frontier Constabulary. It was also decided 
that the political agents will be used to start the operation 
because these areas are under FRC laws which cannot be 
challenged in any Pakistani court. Only the political agents can 
arrest persons under these laws. The decision to strengthen the 
security on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to stop smuggling of 
narcotics from Afghanistan to Pakistan was also made in this 
meeting. All related officials have been informed in this 
context. Mr. Dil Jan Khan, secretary of drug control ministry, 
is going to meet with the home secretary and governor of Sarhad 
to get cooperation from Sarhad state.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Operation Against Drug Smugglers"] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that the federal government has 
started to implement a strong policy to totally eradicate the 
curse of drug abuse by 2000 AD. Under this policy, not only laws 
related to the drug trade and smuggling will be made stricter, 
but also the administrative units responsible for stopping the 
drug trade will be made more effective. There is a question 
about the destructive nature of drugs, however, the involved 
people manage to avoid arrest using their wealth and legal 
loopholes. The present government has taken a bold step in 
deciding to have death sentences for drug smugglers in order to 
end this curse. However, it is important to catch the major 
criminals involved in this trade in order to abolish this cursed 
trade fully. All this cannot be achieved without the cooperation 
of the army. During the last government's efforts in this 
direction, some of them had gone underground and some had even 
established their own gangs. In this situation, a major 
operation with the cooperation of the army can be successful to 
wipe out the drug smugglers. The government should not hesitate 
in implementing such a plan.

  [Text] Peshawar (City Reporter) -- The CIA [Crime 
Investigation Agency] police has recovered a huge quantity of 
chemicals used for preparing heroin. This chemical was being 
smuggled out from Peshawar. The police foiled the effort and 
arrested three persons. According to details the police learned 
that a chemical used for making heroin was being sent from 
Lahore to a man named Ziar Khan. He was to collect it at 
Pindi-Peshawar bus stop on 4 December. A police party headed by 
Shah Wali, DSP [Deputy Superintendent of Police] of CIA, was 
formed. This police party surrounded the alleged place, and 
arrested Ziar Shah and Shah Gul of Jamrud when they came to 
collect the chemical in seven boxes by producing receipt number 
8300. The police arrested [them] along with their papers. The 
accused persons later revealed that their other associate, 
Kashmir, was waiting for them in a Suzuki outside the bus stop. 
Kashmir was also arrested when he was identified by the 
suspects. It should be known that these criminals have heroin 
factories and this chemical is very important for production. A 
large amount of heroin can be manufactured with one kilogram of 
this chemical. The police have seized 210 kilograms of this 
chemical. [editorial note: report did not specify precursor 
chemical or chemicals seized]

  [Text] Islamabad (Special correspondent) -- A female 
arrested for trying to smuggle heroin abroad was released on 
bail. The full Bench of the Supreme Court accepted the accused's 
bail plea. The Bench was composed of acting Chief Justice 
Shafiul Rehman, Justice Abdulqadir Chowdhery, and Justice Ghani 
Mohammed. The suspect Asima was accused of trying to smuggle two 
kilograms of heroin in London and was arrested at Heathrow 
airport. She was returned to Pakistan and the Pakistan Narcotics 
Control Board had taken her into custody. The accused was sent 
to jail where she later spent 10 months and 18 days. Her appeal 
for bail was refused by various courts before it. However, the 
Supreme Court because of her gender has released her on a bail 
of 100,000 rupees. Two other persons, Matlub Hussein and Ziaul 
Din, were also arrested when Asima had fingered them. They have 
been jailed. Ilias Siddiqi represented Asima in the bail 
proceedings and Attorney General Mumtaz Ali argued on behalf of 
the government.

  [Text] Riyadh, Jan 23, SPA -- The Director of Public 
Security General Ahmad Bin Mohammad Bilal [spelling as received] 
opened the first Saudi-French anti-narcotics symposium here on 
Sunday. 
  Delivering the inaugural address General Bilal said the 
symposium is the outcome of positive cooperation between 
anti-narcotics authorities in the kingdom and France. 
  He praised the efforts exerted by the Saudi Government to 
provide security and stability for both citizens and residents. 
  He reviewed agreements signed by the kingdom in the field of 
combating narcotics and stressed that Saudi Arabia has enacted 
several extremely deterrent regulations to curb drug smuggling 
or trafficking. 
  He said the kingdom has also gone a long way in 
international 
and regional cooperation to combat narcotics. 
  The acting director of the anti-narcotics department and 
supervisor of the symposium Brigadier General Darwish Bin 
Ibrahim Faqiha [spelling as received] said the symposium was 
held in line with the directives of Interior Minister Prince 
Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz who is extremely keen on fighting 
narcotics in the Arab world in general and the kingdom in 
particular. 
  He said the kingdom exerts intensive efforts to combat 
narcotics on the basis of a number of concepts foremost among 
which is the commitment to Islam and original Arab traditions. 
  He said the kingdom is among the least affected countries by 
the narcotics problem because of the Saudi Government's keeness 
on the security and safety of the citizens and the homeland. 
  He stressed that the kingdom has never had one incident of 
growing, producing or making illegal drugs of any kind and that 
the death penalty has been applied to deter drug traffickers, 
smugglers and carriers. 
  He added that out of his conviction that drug addicts are 
sick persons who need medical and psychological treatment, 
Prince Nayif has ordered that addicts be treated as such and 
three specialized hospitals have been established for this 
purpose in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam. 
  He said the anti-narcotics department, in collaboration with 
the national anti-narcotics committee chaired by the President 
of Youth Welfare Prince Faysal Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, implements a 
comprehensive strategy on preventive awareness against illegal 
drug abuse. 
  The head of the French central anti-narcotics bureau 
delivered a speech in which he pointed to the importance of 
Saudi-French anti-narcotics cooperation and expressed hope that 
this cooperation would continue. 
  Saudi and French officials and experts are participating in 
the four-day symposium. 
  The inaugural session was attended by the French ambassador 
to the kingdom and several Saudi officials.

  [Text] Gdansk, Jan. 19--Polish customs officials on Tuesday 
uncovered a haul of 517 kg of cocaine at the container port in 
Gdynia, Dariusz Pogorzelski of the Gdynia district prosecutors 
office announced on Wednesday. 
  The cocaine was hidden in two containers' false walls on the 
Polish vessel "Lublin II," which according to the documentation 
contained a consignment of bananas and coffee from Ecuador. 
  Pogorzelski said the haul could be even larger because the 
search inside the third container on vessel was continuing. 
  The containers were shipped by an Ecuador-based fruit 
company 
to a firm based in the tri-city of Gdansk, Sopot, Gdynia. 
  The State Protection Bureau (UOP), the customs office are 
investigating the case under the supervision of the Gdynia 
prosecutor's office. 
  "Lublin II" is owned by the "Polamerica" company, whose 
shareholder is the Polish Ocean Lines Company. 
  The haul is one of the largest in the history of Polands 
fight against the narcotics trade, which has become a major 
problem in recent years for Polands drug-enforcement officials.

  The BND says that the blackmailing of officials is a common

  Four or five grams of hashish were also found in Palumbo's 
pockets. Customs authorities confiscated the drugs and Palumbo

Drug Smuggler"] 
  [Text] A 24-year-old Danish male has been sentenced to 
eight months in prison a mere two weeks after being nabbed in 
Reykjavik with 3.7 kilograms of hashish. 
  The man initially claimed he had been contracted to funnel 
the illegal narcotic to Iceland on the basis of an 
acquaintanceship struck up in Amsterdam, and in return for a 
$2,500 fee. 
  The illegal stash was then to be picked up in Reykjavik 
after 
he had checked into a hotel. 
  During court questioning the Dane related that he feared 
retaliation from his "employer," of whose identity he had no 
idea other than that he went under the name of Franck, and was a 
foreign citizen residing in Iceland. 
  Despite making pronouncements to the contrary, the Dane 
subsequently claimed he had acted alone in smuggling the hashish 
into the country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cannabis Found in 10 Percent of </F>
Driver Samples"] 
  [Text] Traces of cannabis were found in blood tests taken 
from almost 10 percent of drivers stopped by Reykjavik police on 
suspicion of drunk driving during the second half of 1992 and 
the first six months of 1993. 
  This was revealed recently at a press conference held by the 
Department of Pharmacology at the University of Iceland, where 
during the period in question, 200 samples were tested; 19 
contained traces of the drug and 171 showed an alcohol content 
below the legal limit of 0.5 percent. 
  As the research team, headed by Professor Thorkell 
Johannesson and operating in close cooperation with the police 
forces with the Reykjavik conurbation and the Traffic Safety 
Council, was originally concerned only with alcohol levels, 17 
of the first 171 drivers tested who later proved to have traces 
of cannabis in their blood will not now have to face prosecution. 
  Since cannabis is a banned substance in Iceland and its 
possession and use punishable by law, no special provision is 
made in the road traffic laws regarding driving under the 
influence. Technically, therefore, anyone convicted of doing so 
does not run the risk of losing his license. 
  Each year from 2,000 to 4,000 drivers are stopped by police 
on suspicion of drunk driving, and it is estimated that alcohol 
is involved in some 50 accidents every year, with drivers under 
the legal limit in 10 percent of those cases. This latter group 
has received particular attention from the team. 
  Speaking to national media, Johannesson and Reykjavik Police 
Chief Bodvar Bragson said there was now an urgent need to 
investigate the presence of other drugs, particularly 
amphetamine, in blood samples taken from drivers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cali Cartel Laundered Narcodollars"] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 19 Jan (ANSA) -- Florence Chief Prosecutor 
Pierluigi Vigna, outlining the Unigold operation today, 
complained that "once again we have had no notification from the 
banks" involved in that operation to launder an estimated 100 
million dollars a month by purchasing 1,000 kg of gold. 
  The banks used in the recycling scheme included Monte dei 
Paschi di Siena, Banca Commerciale Italiana and the Banca 
Populare dell'Etruria e del Lazio. 
  Vigna said his office was notifying Bank of Italy about the 
financial institutes failure to report bank operations over 20 
million lire. "Under present rules, only administrative 
sanctions can be applied against banks that don't comply, but 
that needs to be changed," Vigna said. 
  "A traffic on a scale and of a nature such as to risk 
throwing out of kilter the mechanisms of the gold market in 
Italy and, indeed, throughout the world," was how expert Adriano 
Pansa described the laundry set up by the Cali cartel and the 
Arezzo gold traders. 
  Revealing that investigators had uncovered details on just 
three single operations totalling 300 million dollars, Pansa 
pointed out that the money-washers were not overconcerned about 
making a profit, since their main objective was simply to change 
the drug revenue into cash, and thus often sold their gold below 
the going rate. 
  He expressed the view that the apparent lack of Sicilian 
Mafia involvement did not mean Cosa Nostra had not also been 
using the laundry, since the mob has made a point of delegating 
recycling to so-called "white-collar" teams, especially since 
the massive Green Ice narco-traffic bust 18 months ago. 
  Six of the eight arrests in Italy, including Delgado (37), 
were made at or near the northeastern city of Vicenza, home of 
an alleged Italian ringleader, jewelry trader Rino Perozzo, and 
also home to the twice-yearly Vicenza Gold trade fair (reputedly 
the world's most important jewelry event), which has just opened. 
  The others arrested at Vicenza or nearby Bassano del Grappa 
were Carlo Fabbroni (35), Fabrizio Meotti (47), Luciano Pataro 
(43), and Nicola Pirro (25). Pataro's brother was arrested in 
Arezzo. Of the four arrests in Panama, two were a well-known 
pair of brothers--only the surname, Schwartz, was released 
here--who have reportedly held a monopoly in gold trading since 
the time of felled dictator Roberto Noriega. 
  The operation began last June when the US Drug Enforcement 
Administration notified Italian authorities of a payment of 
150,000 dollars from a US bank. Investigators traced the money 
back to three Arezzo companies: Aurea Trading International, 
Italian representative for the US Universe Gold Enterprise (both 
owned by the Pataro brothers); Simar Joyeros Mayoristas, with an 
office in Arezzo headed by Meotti and another in Panama run by 
the Schwartz brothers; and Eurocatene, headed by Fabbroni. 
  These three companies held the bank accounts into which the 
narcodollars were sent to be used to buy up gold on the Italian 
market. The gold was then sent to be sold in Panama, after 
which the clean dollars returned to the drug-traffickers.

  [Text] Palermo, Italy, Jan 21 (AFP) -- A court here Friday 
[21 January] jailed 13 heroin traffickers, including a suspected 
mafia chief on the run, who was given 20 years, a judicial 
official said. 
  The smuggling ring sending heroin to the United States was 
allegedly headed by Pietro Aglieri, who was named by a mafia 
turncoat and is considered one of the new heads of organised 
crime in Sicily. 
  As well as receiving a 20-year sentence, Aglieri was fined 
150 million lire (90,000 dollars). 
  Salvatore Cancemi, a former mafioso who betrayed the ring, 
escaped with seven years and a 40 million lire fine. 
  In a separate hearing, the court imposed a 15-year sentence 
on American mafia boss John Gambino, which the official said was 
negotiated in New York in return for his collaboration. 
  Cancemi admitted running a heroin refinery at Caccamo, 40 
kilometres (25 miles) from Palermo, producing drugs which Toto 
Riina, a top mafia leader currently on trial, allegedly exported 
to the United States. 
  Francesco Marina Mannoia, another turncoat who alleged links 
between the mafia and former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, 
also worked in the refinery.

  [Text] The fight against drugs is to be stepped up. A new 
protocol was signed today. The government initiative involves 
three ministries: Internal Administration, Justice, and Finance. 
The main objectives are to combat the entry of narcotics into 
Portugal, prevent their distribution, and to make access to 
consumers more difficult. Celso Paiva reports. 
  [Paiva] Three ministries stand united against drugs. All of 
them are responsible for key sectors, that if coordinated can 
achieve better results. From Internal Administration there is 
the security forces, from Finance there is the Borders 
Directorate-General, and from Justice there is the Judicial 
Police [plain clothes police] and obviously the legal processes 
necessary to carry out certain operations. With the protocol 
signed today, the government is trying to coordinate the 
prevention and fight against drugs. It is trying to allocate a 
specific mission to each entity but without them stepping on 
each others' toes. And together, with coordination, they will 
be able to fight drug trafficking. 
  Firstly, it is necessary to fight the entry of drugs into 
the 
country, but it is also necessary to work from within: To 
prevent distribution and to make access to consumers more 
difficult. The document was signed by the directors general of 
the Judicial Police, of the PSP [Public Security Police], of the 
GNR [National Republican Guard], of the Borders 
Directorate-General, and of the Planning Group for the Fight 
Against Drugs. The three ministers were left to make the 
speeches. Dias Loureiro [internal administration] was the first 
to speak and began by revealing crime figures for 1993. A 2.5 
to three percent increase, according to the minister this is a 
very good figure, bearing in mind that in 1992 the increase 
reached nine to 10 percent. Dias Loureiro was quoting figures 
from the Attorney General's Office. The minister went on to add 
that the 2.5 to three percent increase is mainly due to 
drugs--after all, the main topic of this meeting of the Higher 
Council for Internal Security. 
  Laborinho Lucio [justice] spoke next. He confirmed the crime 
figures and said he was very pleased with the protocol just 
signed. 
  [Announcer] The government is committed to the fight against 
drugs. A difficult mission as the business does not stop 
growing, you just have to look at the quantities of drugs being 
seized. Teresa Xavier reports. 
  [Xavier] The police have stated that the amount of drugs 
being seized in Portugal is rising. With regard to heroin, in 
1993, 86 kilos were seized--62 percent up on 1992. As for 
hashish, 48,000 kilos were seized in 1993--seven times the 
amount seized in 1992. Cocaine is an exception, the figures show 
a downward trend. The police said that in 1992, 1,900 kilos 
were seized, while last year only 166 kilos were seized. The 
amount of cocaine seized dropped by 91 percent. Most of the 
drugs were seized at borders and airports. 
  [Begin Anselmo Louro recording, identified below] With 
regard 
to heroin, a small percentage was seized at the Vilar Formoso 
border. A higher percentage was seized in private homes in the 
interior of the country. As you know, heroin is destined for 
internal consumption, and it has been difficult to seize it at 
the borders. As for cocaine, most of it--about 80 percent or 
more--was seized at airports. Hashish was seized in the 
interior of the country, coming from ships, via the sea, and 
from Morocco. [end recording] 
  [Xavier] That was Anselmo Louro from the Department for the 
Investigation and Fight Against Drug Trafficking. The drugs 
seized in Portugal come from, among other places, Germany, Peru, 
and Morocco. 
  [Begin Louro recording] With regard to cocaine, most of it 
comes from Peru--1,754 kilos. As for hashish, the largest 
amount came from Morocco--8,862.3 kilos. As for heroin, 55 
kilos were seized nationally, 30.235 kilos alone from 
Holland--more than 50 percent. [end recording] 
  [Xavier] Heroin, cocaine, and hashish are the drugs most 
consumed in our country, and the ones most sought after by the 
police, who only manage to seize less than 10 percent of the 
drugs that enter Portugal.

  [Text] Ankara -- Behcet Canturk, one of the prominent 
figures of the Turkish drug and arms smuggling world, was killed 
on Saturday [15 January]. Canturk who was also the sponsor of 
the pro-Kurdish paper "Ozgur Gundem" was found dead, along with 
his driver, near the Sapanca district of Sakarya. 
  The examination of the two unidentified bodies, which were 
found on the TEM highway near Kirkpinar, Sapanca, has revealed 
that one of the bodies belonged to Canturk. The other body next 
to Canturk, who was shot once in the mouth, was identified as 
belonging to his driver Recep Kuzucu. There were no identity 
cards on the bodies, which were taken to the mortuary of the 
Sakarya State Hospital where they were identified by their 
relatives. 
  Security officials, who stated that there were many empty 
cartridges in the area where the bodies were found, said that 
investigations were underway. Drawing attention to the fact 
that the conflict among drug smugglers has recently become 
tense, the officials said that the smugglers were settling 
accounts among themselves for reasons which were as yet unknown. 
"The men may have been killed as a result of this power 
struggle," the officials added. 
  Born in Lice, Diyarbakir in 1950, Canturk committed his 
first 
murder at the age of 15 when he was a student at a junior high 
school. After serving a prison term of one year, Canturk was 
released under an amnesty of the time. In 1969, during an 
inter-tribe struggle, he murdered another person. Security 
forces were unable to catch him and he committed two more 
murders while at large. 
  When he turned himself in to the police in 1971, he was set 
free again in 1974 in accordance with a further amnesty. 
  Canturk, who was the leader of the Canturk tribe in the town 
of Lice in the province of Diyarbakir, settled in Istanbul in 
1979. He started to deal with arms and drug smuggling from that 
time. Canturk, whose mother and whose second wife were both of 
Armenian origin, was taken into custody following the coup of 
Sept. 12, 1980 and tried in the case publicly referred to as the 
"The Case of the Godfathers." The charges were of providing 
financial support to the Armenian terrorist organization, ASALA 
[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia], and to the 
outlawed Kurdish organization Progressive Eastern Cultural Clubs 
(DDKD). The prosecutor demanded capital punishment for Canturk, 
but he was acquitted after a series of hearings. 
  Canturk was also tried at the Diyarbakir Military Court on 
charges of smuggling heroin to European countries by sea. He 
was acquitted due to lack of evidence. 
  In 1991, he started to publish the pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur 
Gundem with Yasar Kaya. Although he was financing the paper, he 
had left the auditing of the paper's accounts to another person 
in line with the company's statutes.

  [Text] Turkey is in the middle of the route the drug 
traffickers use to transport their narcotic substances from 
Central Asia to Europe. The opium produced in Afghanistan, 
Pakistan, and Iran, which are known as the Golden Crescent 
countries, is transported through Turkey to Europe, either 
through highways or sea ports. 
  The production of narcotic substances significantly 
increased 
in the region after the Soviet Union collapsed. For example, 
the production of narcotic drugs increased by 10 times in 
Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the effort made to place the production 
of narcotic substances under control in Uzbekistan, 
Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan, which became independent republics 
after the Soviet Union disintegrated, has not been successful. 
Nearly three-quarters of the narcotic drugs used in Western 
Europe come from the Golden Crescent countries and Central Asia. 
  The narcotic substances produced in the Golden Crescent 
countries and Central Asia are smuggled into Turkey in three 
ways. The first is the route from southern Afghanistan, which 
crosses through Iran and reaches Turkey. The drug traffickers 
also use the authority vacuum in northern Iraq as an opportunity 
to smuggle their narcotic substances into Turkey. The second 
route is the sea ports. Narcotic drugs are transported from the 
Golden Crescent countries to Karachi in Pakistan. They are then 
loaded on ships that carry them to the Mediterranean Sea through 
the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal. The vessel 
Lucky-S was placed under custody in the Mediterranean Sea for 
carrying narcotic drugs in 1993. The narcotic substances were 
loaded on the vessel in Karachi. Officials impounded 14 tonnes 
of narcotic drugs on the Lucky-S. 
  The vessel Kismetim-1 also picked up a cargo of narcotic 
drugs in Pakistan in 1993. The crew members reportedly sank 
that vessel to prevent the police from impounding its cargo. 
  The third route through Turkey is from the Caucasus, a 
region 
that has been troubled by internal unrest since the Soviet Union 
collapsed. Narcotic substances are transported from the Golden 
Crescent countries to the Caspian Sea through Turkmenistan. 
From there, they are transported to Azerbaijan and Georgia 
either in ships or in vehicles, which use the highways to the 
north of the Caspian Sea. The internal confusion in Azerbaijan 
and Georgia facilitates the activities of the drug traffickers 
in that region. The narcotic drugs, which are smuggled into 
Turkey in ships or TIR [Transit Highway International] trucks, 
are later transported to Western Europe either in similar 
trucks, which cross through the Balkan countries, or in ships, 
which call at several ports in the Mediterranean Sea.

  [Text] Six men accused of involvement in one of Britain's 
biggest drug smuggling operations were cleared by a jury amid 
uproar at Southwark Crown Court yesterday. 
  Friends and relatives cheered as the jury found them not 
guilty of smuggling &pound;125 million worth of cocaine into 
Britain at the end of a three-month trial estimated to have a 
cost &pound;2 million. 
  They were held in an operation by Customs and police after 
the 115 ft yacht Fox Trot V, carrying 796 kg of the drug, docked 
at Durham Wharf, Charlton, south-east London, in November last 
year. 
  Five were alleged to have been involved with the equipping 
and crewing of the boat while the sixth was said to have rented 
space to store the drugs. Three leading members of the 
conspiracy were said to have escaped. 
  The man alleged to have rented warehouse space, Derek 
Hillier, 34, a plumber of Woodside Crescent, Sidcup Kent, told 
the jury he was forced at gunpoint by people so far not caught. 
  But the other five maintained they did know the ship, on 
which they were crew, was carrying drugs. 
  In the dock were Barry Murphy, 41, of Walworth, south east 
London; Barry Patrick Murphy, 21, of the same address; Lee 
Murphy, 26, of Abbey Wood, south London; Jose Lopez, 30, of 
Morden, south London, and Paul Williams, 25, of Kentish Town, 
north London. They all denied importing cocaine.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Ford: "High Earners Are the Biggest </F>
Users of Illegal Drugs"] 
  [Text] High-income earners from the upper and middle 
classes are the biggest users of illegal drugs in Britain today, 
according to the most detailed survey of drug use done for the 
Government. 
  Wealthier people are more likely to have smoked cannabis or 
taken other drugs than those from the bottom end of earnings 
scale. 
  The study, by academics from Sheffield University, found 
that 
two thirds of those questioned backed existing laws banning 
drugs, but the rest supported a limited form of legalising 
certain drugs on a controlled basis. 
  Those from the higher social classes were more likely than 
other groups to favour decriminalising drugs. 
  The survey, conducted among 5,000 people in Nottingham, 
Bradford, Lewisham, south London, and Glasgow, estimates that 
about one in five people in Britain has taken an illegal drug 
during his life, with much higher levels of drug-taking among 
people aged between 16 and 25. 
  One in 15 had recently used an illegal drug. 
  Between 14 and 24 per cent of people questioned admitted 
using an illegal drug at some time in their life and between 5 
and 9 per cent confessed to recent usage. 
  Among the 250 people aged between 16 and 25 who were 
surveyed, those who had taken drugs ranged from 32 per cent in 
Bradford to 52 per cent in Glasgow. 
  Between 16 and 35 per cent admitted taking drugs within the 
past year. 
  Its findings counter previous studies that have emphasised 
drug usage among lower economic groups, upon whom many 
government and local authority drug prevention initiatives are 
focused. 
  The survey said: "With regard to lifetime drug usage, the 
wealthier respondents in the AB and CI socio-economic groups 
proved to the most prominent users. The most prevalent drug 
users in the general population are likely to be young, white 
males in those groups." 
  Cannabis usage was found to be prominent among those from 
the 
higher echelons of society but the study revealed that in two 
sample areas--Lewisham and Nottingham--amphetamines, amylnitrate 
and magic mushrooms were also widely used. 
  This trend was confirmed in other areas such as Glasgow and 
Bradford in West Yorkshire. 
  While the upper and middle classes were prominent users of 
cannabis, the study found that heroin and crack were used more 
by the low-status groups, with injected drugs more common among 
the C2s and DEs. 
  "The final picture, in terms of patterns of drug taking, is 
one in which, in these four cities, a substantial minority of 
young people made mostly occasional use of cannibis and, to a 
lesser extent, other drugs," the survey said. 
  The study found that local availability of drugs was so good 
that any restriction on drug usage was governed by personal 
choice rather than controlling supplies. 
  Most people said they had little difficulty obtaining drugs 
when they wanted. 
  More men than women admitted to having ever taken a drug 
that 
was illegal, but the gap narrowed in the 16 to 25 age range with 
45 per cent of men and 37 per cent of women admitting to having 
taken such drugs.

  [Text] Rural teenagers are now as steeped in the drugs 
culture as their urban counterparts, according to a Home 
Office-backed study. 
  New research conducted in East Sussex indicates that the 
level of knowledge displayed by young people in the country is 
generally comparable to those in provincial towns. 
  The finding comes two months after Government statistics 
revealed that the biggest increases in drug offences are now 
taking place in rural areas. 
  Researchers surveyed 26 secondary schools in urban parts of 
East Sussex and the rural district of North Wealden. 
  They found that the majority of schoolchildren claimed never 
to have tried drugs. But three quarters of the teenagers said 
they knew someone who used cannabis, ecstasy or amphetamines. 
  A third said they had been offered those drugs and of those, 
two thirds had tried either cannabis, amphetamines, solvents and 
hallucinogenic substances. 
  Boys were more likely to be offered drugs and most often 
agreed to take them. 
  Researchers assessed the level of drug use among East Sussex 
14 and 15-year-olds as 20-23 per cent. The level for North 
Wealden was 17-23 per cent. 
  They concluded the level of "drug involvement" for the East 
Sussex teenagers was lower than the same age group in the large 
inner cities. 
  But they said they are "generally higher than those found in 
samples in comparable areas elsewhere in the country."

Through"] 
  [Text] One tonne and 837 kilograms--that is the total 
weight of the drugs intercepted by the customs service of Russia 
since the beginning of the year. By comparison, 437 kilograms 
were intercepted for the same period last year. 
  As an official of the department for fighting contraband 
narcotics of the State Customs Committee of Russia reported to a 
MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent, customs officers confiscated 
72 kilograms of poppy straw in Bryansk last Monday. But about 
300 kilograms of a similar narcotic substance were confiscated 
in the last two months in the very same channel. The largest 
batch of contraband narcotics in Moscow in the last month was 
found in cargo that arrived from Nigeria at Sheremetyevo-2 
International Airport. The "gift"--105 kilograms of 
marijuana--which was concealed in the defrosting trays and 
between the walls of cooling chambers, was addressed to a 
private person in Moscow. 
  The main flow of drugs moves to Russia from the northwestern 
region--Lithuania, Kaliningrad Oblast, Ukraine, and Belarus. The 
situation with tracking drug channels on the southern borders is 
made very difficult in connection with the disintegration of the 
USSR and the formation of independent states. 
  In 1993, Russian customs officers conducted 11 "controlled 
deliveries" jointly with their foreign colleagues for the 
purpose of tracking the network of suppliers, deliverers, and 
buyers. In the course of operations to ship heroin, cocaine, 
hashish, opium, and marijuana from India, Nepal, Thailand, 
Singapore, Jamaica, and Colombia to Russia, 37 kilograms of 
narcotics were confiscated, of which 24.5 kilograms were heroin. 
One "controlled delivery" of five kilograms of opium from Russia 
to the Armenian community in Los Angeles was also conducted. 
  According to data acquired from competent sources by the 
MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent, according to drug market 
prices, one glass of poppy straw now costs from 20,000 rubles 
[R] to R50,000, depending on the quality of the purity, and one 
matchbox of low-quality marijuana costs from R3,000 to R5,000, 
and high-quality marijuana--up to R10,000.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Levchuk under the "Customs" rubric: "On </F>
the Routes of `White Death'"--passages within slantlines 
published in boldface] 
  [Text] /This sensation has not faded even on the 
background of People's Deputy Lukashenko's speech in the Supreme 
Soviet. The confiscation of a record amount of drugs by the 
Brest custom-house (2,389 kg) brings a new sense to the word 
"Mafia" and makes one think about the place of Belarus in the 
international drug business./ 
  "International cartels actively use the West European market 
for drug sales, including such dangerous drugs as heroin and 
cocaine." Such was the conclusion in a statement made by the 
board for combating smuggling to the chairman of the State 
Committee for Customs. "Belarus has been given a role of a 
trans-shipment base with some drugs remaining on the spot." In 
1992, there were 740 cases of crime related to drugs in Belarus; 
the militia confiscated 800 kg of drug substances. In the first 
half of 1993, there were 545 criminal cases and 500 kg of 
confiscated drugs. 
  The State Committee for Customs' specialists for combating 
smuggling assert that international drug cartels consider 
Belarus to be a state with a more weaker customs regime than 
those in the West. According to the data as of 20 December 1993, 
Belarusian customs officers deterred 38 drug smuggling cases and 
confiscated 2,645 kg of intoxicating substances. Formerly, 
confiscated drugs were reprocessed at one Russian pharmaceutical 
plant; now they are simply destroyed. 
  In the majority of cases, the deadly substances are shipped 
to Germany; shipments to Poland are rare. Among the arrested 
smugglers, Germans constitute 50 percent--they are immigrants 
from Central Asia (mainly from Kazakhstan) which is a 
traditional drug supplier. The age of the "pushers" averages 
between 20 and 30 years. According to specialists, small drug 
dealers can join vast Mafia structures. 
  Russian N., who was driving to Poland in his Volkswagen 
"Passat," has been caught with 7,400 grams of drug substances 
that were hidden under the car trunk as well as under the front 
fenders. He asserted that he had planted hemp on the fields of 
Prokhladnenskiy Rayon 40 km from Nalchik. 
  A student from Lvov was carrying with him 5,040 grams of 
poppy straw in a St. Petersburg--Lvov train; according to his 
statement, he stole it from one Lithuanian national who traveled 
on the same train. 
  A question ensues: Given today's transparency of borders as 
well as the deficiency of technical equipment for customs 
control, are the detections of large drug shipments not 
accidental? Are some other containers with drugs not "racing" 
on Belarusian territory, as it happened with that shipment of 
raisins, which contained 2,389 kg of marijuana? According to 
the information from the board for combating smuggling, 
detection of drugs are due only to the intuition of customs 
officers. In prospect, the personnel of the board for combating 
smuggling will be expanded, and special dogs will be trained to 
detect drugs. Customs officers already have special tests to 
identify drugs. 
  Argentina--Singapore--Pakistan--Afghanistan. Now we can add 
Belarus to this traditional route. 
  "The point is not only in the fall of the Iron Curtain 
and the Soviet Union," states G. Gribach, head of the board for 
combating smuggling within the State Committee for Customs. "We 
assume that Belarus has become the route for drug shipments from 
the `Golden Crescent' countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) 
because of the closing of the Balkan route due to warfare there. 
This assumption can be corroborated by a container with a large 
shipment of drugs, which, before reaching Belarus, crossed the 
`Termez' check point at the Afghan-Uzbekistani border and 
traversed Kazakhstan and Russia. One more container with such a 
load has been detained by the Polish customs service. 
  Recently, specialists of the board for combating smuggling 
reached an agreement with their Russian counterparts on 
reestablishing the old system of cooperation in combating 
smuggling in order to block the route of the `white death.'"

  [Summary] According to experts, in the last two years there 
has been a significant increase in the availability of drugs in 
Georgia, mainly from Azerbaijan and the Tskhinval region. 
  On 22 January, Georgian law enforcement bodies started a 
massive operation against drug dealers in Georgia. The republic 
was divided into nine sectors. In each the operation was headed 
by deputy security and internal affairs ministers. It involved 
1,500 people. As a result of the operation, 20 machine guns and 
carbines and about 50 kilos of drugs were confiscated, and 12 
stolen cars were recovered by 24 January. About 20 people were 
arrested. According to the spokesman of the Internal Affairs 
Ministry, some high ranking officials have been implicated in 
drug trafficking.

  [Text] Shenyang, December 8 (XINHUA) -- Benxi city in 
northeast China, which was once "invisible" from satellite 
because of thick smoke and other pollutants, will have a cleaner 
sky thanks to its current efforts in pollution control. 
  The Benxi Steel and Iron Complex, one of the leading 
pollutant dischargers in this city in Liaoning Province, has 
recently equipped all seven huge boilers at its power plant with 
dust removal devices, thus reducing the local dust fall by 
one-third, local officials said. 
  The dust-removal project has cost three years and 80 million 
yuan, contributed by the government and the complex. After it 
went into operation recently, local citizens, especially those 
living in the surroundings of the complex, said that they felt 
the air is obviously cleaner this winter, according to the 
officials. 
  Song Jian, a State Councilor, sent his congratulations to 
the 
complex for its encouraging achievements in reducing pollution. 
  The project is a part of "Operation Blue Sky," launched in 
the city five years ago to reduce serious air pollution. 
  The "Operation Blue Sky" involves a total investment of 375 
million yuan, part of which will be undertaken by the Benxi 
steel complex. 
  Though suffering from a serious shortage of funds, the 
officials said the complex will invest another 300 million yuan 
to carry out five more projects to reduce pollution.

  [Text] Nanjing, December 8 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangsu 
Province has decided to set up an environmental protection 
science development fund this year. 
  A provincial official in charge of scientific development 
said the fund, which comes mainly from penalties levied against 
polluters, will amount to more than four million yuan. 
  It will be used in spreading environmental protection 
science 
research findings and pilot projects in the form of low-interest 
and interest free loans. 
  The official noted that the fund will advance the study and 
popularization of research findings in environmental protection 
and promote the harmonious development of the economy and the 
preservation of the environment. 
  China's leading economic giant, Jiangsu put forward a 
strategy of developing its economy by relying on science in 1989.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "Pollution Is Worse in Some </F>
Areas of Country"] 
  [Text] Environmental pollution has worsened in some parts 
of the country. 
  The situation has occurred because of relaxed enforcement of 
State laws and regulations on environmental protection. 
  The findings are from a recent national inspection on 
environmental law enforcement by the State Environmental 
Protection Agency (SEPA). 
  The investigation determined that many local policy makers 
sacrifice their environment for the sake of economic profit. 
  Local governments must further tighten supervision over 
implementation of environmental laws and regulations and crack 
down on illegal conduct that endangers the environment, 
according to SEPA official Hu Baolin. 
  Hu said his bureau will continue its publicity campaigns to 
raise environmental awareness across the nation, especially that 
of leaders at various levels. 
  The agency will map out some new regulations and revise old 
ones in accord with changed economic and social situations. 
  It hopes the central and local governments will increase 
their budgets for environmental work. 
  SEPA, jointly with the environmental protection committees 
under the State Council and the National People's Congress 
(NPC), just concluded a four-month environmental inspection in 
seven provinces and regions. 
  They include Heilongjiang, Shandong, Yunnan, Guangdong, 
Anhui 
and Jiangsu provinces and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  It is the first phase of a nation-wide environmental law 
enforcement inspection. The whole programme will take two years. 
  This year's inspection focused on the enforcement of State 
laws on environmental protection and wild life preservation. 
  The inspection discovered that a contract responsibility 
system has been introduced in many provinces to protect the 
environment. And environmental protection work has been included 
in provincial social and economic development programmes. 
  The seven regions have altogether promulgated some 50 local 
regulations on environmental issues. 
  Yet, some local leaders have neglected environmental 
problems 
while pursuing profits. 
  Lunan County in Yunnan Province, for example, constructed a 
cement plant in the State "Stone Forest" scenic area. 
  And a vice-governor of Dali Prefecture decided, without 
authorization, to stop collecting pollution charges from local 
industrial enterprises for three years. 
  Jixi Iron and Steel Company in Heilongjiang Province, which 
is the biggest pollutant in the city, did not complete its 
pollution treatment projects on time and refused to hand over a 
fine of 10,000 yuan (about $1,724). 
  In Hangzhou, capital city of Zhejiang Province, about 80 
percent of the 56 enterprises inspected discharge untreated 
pollutants into the environment. 
  Meanwhile, some harmful wastes have been imported into the 
country. 
  Some small township enterprises, closed in the past by the 
State for contaminating the environment, have reemerged in some 
places.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Gao Jinan: "Officials Introduce </F>
Ecological Agriculture"] 
  [Text] The government yesterday introduced a large-scale 
ecological project to integrate agricultural development and 
environmental protection. 
  The project, given high priority by the State Council, is 
considered a vital move in stemming deterioration of the rural 
environment, reducing natural disasters and promoting sustained 
development of an "ecological agriculture," according to State 
Councillor Chen Junsheng. 
  The undertaking is a joint endeavor among the departments of 
forestry, environment protection, water conservancy and 
agriculture, Chen told a national conference yesterday. 
  The State councilor urged governments at all level to 
consider rural ecology, an issue he said has been insufficiently 
weighted in the development of agriculture and rural economy. 
  Chen said he hoped that departments like forestry, water 
resources, planning, finance and sciences would co-ordinate 
their efforts in implementing the project. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture and six other ministries 
launched 
the plan yesterday by designating 50 counties as ecological 
agricultural-development centres. 
  Starting in 1980, China has introduced 
experimental-environmental projects in about 1,000 villages, 
townships and counties. 
  According to Vice-Agricultural Minister Hong Fuzeng, about 
200 counties, with a total area of some 14 million hectares of 
farmland, will be developed as ecological-agriculture projects 
by the year 2,000. 
  China feeds 22 percent of the world's population with only 7 
per cent of its farmland. 
  Hong said the worsening agricultural ecology should be 
controlled as soon as possible. 
  Because of population growth and industrial production, 
466,700 to 533,300 hectares of farmland are occupied annually by 
urban, industrial, mining and transportation projects. 
  "We have to face the challenges and explore ways to develop 
agriculture while protecting the environment," Hong said. 
  He suggested that the ecological development of agriculture, 
forestry, animal husbandry, sidelines and fishery should be 
coordinated to ensure a balanced increase in output. 
  While reducing pollution caused by cities, industries and 
township enterprises, the utilization of fertilizers, chemical 
pesticides and plastic sheet in the rural areas should also be 
tempered, he said.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "State Vows To Reduce Pollution"] </F>
  [Text] China's power industry is to concentrate on the 
development of resources that produce less pollution than 
coal-fired generators. 
  Efforts to tap hydro and wind resources will be encouraged, 
according to an official from the Ministry of Power Industry. 
  In 2000, hydropower generating capacity will account for 26 
percent of the country's total, compared with 24 percent at 
present. 
  That means hydropower generating capacity will climb to 75 
to 
80 million kilowatts that year. The capacity at the end of 1992 
stood at 40.7 million kilowatts. 
  The industry expects to increase its power generating 
capacity to 310 million kilowatts in 2000 from the present 170 
million kilowatts. 
  The majority of electricity in China is generated by 
coal-fired power plants, which emit minute sulphur particles 
that contaminate the environment. 
  But several hydropower stations, with capacity totalling 20 
million kilowatts, are under construction. 
  Of them, a group capable of producing 9 million kilowatts 
were kicked off this year. 
  Jiang Shaojun, the ministry's spokesman, predicted 148 
billion kilowatt-hours would be generated by hydropower stations 
this year, compared with 134.5 billion in 1992. 
  Development of other energy sources, such as wind power, is 
also to be pushed forward, Jiang said. 
  The industry will strive to gain a capacity of 1 million 
kilowatts by using wind power. 
  In windy North China, especially the country's north western 
provinces and autonomous regions, wind generators are common. 
  In the meantime, the industry will make major measures to 
reduce pollution from thermal power plants. 
  The measures are significant as coal-firing plants will 
remain the mainstay of the industry for the rest of the century. 
  Installing waste-recycling systems in old power stations is 
very expensive. 
  But new thermal plants will be designed to reduce or 
eliminate pollution. 
  However, the official admitted that as a developing nation, 
China needs time to reach anti-pollution standards set by the 
Western nations. 
  The industry has made special efforts to raise the 
standards. 
  The industry has begun co-operation with the Japanese 
Government to treat sulphur-rich coal and smoke from coal-fired 
thermal power plants. 
  The industry will use funds from the Japanese Government for 
several projects. 
  Two sulphur treatment projects are under way in Huangdao, 
Shandong Province, and Taiyuan, Shanxi Province. 
  As for the nuclear power sector, another official from the 
ministry said several new plants are under consideration. 
  "We attach strict anti-radiation standards to our nuclear 
plants," the official said. 
  China has two nuclear power stations, one in Zhejiang 
Province that is already in operation and the other in Guangdong 
Province that is to go into operation this year. 
  Capacity of the two stations totals 2.1 million kilowatts. 
  No other nuclear power plants are likely to go into 
operation 
until after 2000. 
  However, construction of at least three could be kicked off 
before the end of the century, the official said. 
  China, where nuclear power generation is in its beginning 
phase, is seeking moderate development in this sector.

  [Text] Beijing, December 14 (XINHUA) -- Some 14 percent of 
China is covered with forests, eight million hectares more than 
five years ago. 
  Figures given by the Forestry Ministry today show that 
China's forest area has been increasing at an annual growth rate 
of 1.65 percent during the past five years. 
  The afforested area, totalling 33.79 million hectares, is 
the 
biggest in the world, figures from China's fourth forest 
resources survey show. 
  China set up its national forest resources monitoring 
network 
in the early 1970s, which has now undertaken four surveys. 
  During this fourth one, from 1989-1993, the forest resources 
growth rate was over 400 million cubic meters annually, a 
quarter higher than the annual consumption rate of 320 million 
cubic meters. 
  With progress in stopping destructive felling, Xu said, the 
present problem lay in the low quality and low productivity of 
the forests. 
  He said that the socialist market economy required better 
capital management of the forestry resources which could be 
realized as more state-owned forest-related enterprises become 
joint-stock businesses. 
  Meanwhile, he said, the state was making new laws to give 
the 
forests more effective and stricter protection.

  [Text] Xian, December 14 (XINHUA) -- A meeting was held 
today in Yulin city, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, calling 
for efforts to solve environmental pollution due to exploration 
of natural resources around the area. 
  State Councillor Song Jian and other leaders from the 
central 
and local governments took part in the meeting, which was 
sponsored by the Environmental Protection Committee of the State 
Council. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Xie Zhenhua, director of the State 
Bureau of Environmental Protection, said that total proven coal 
reserves in the adjacent area of Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner Mongolia 
now reach over 280 billion tons. 
  He said that reasonable exploration of coal resources in the 
area is of great significance to promoting the development of 
the national economy. 
  But, he added, natural conditions in the area are poor due 
to 
an overemphasis on exploration, to the detriment of 
environmental protection. 
  As a result, the environment was seriously polluted in this 
area, with much coal wasted and a large portion of topsoil 
washed away, he said. 
  He added that the central government has paid very close 
attention to environmental protection in developing natural 
resources in the area. 
  He urged taking forceful measures to reorder coal 
exploration 
and strengthen supervision over environmental protection work in 
this area. 
  In the near future, he continued, the urgent task is to 
clear 
out rivers to ensure that flood peaks pass safely in the coming 
year. 
  The participants also investigated the serious soil damage 
in 
the area due to natural resource exploration.

  [Text] The environmental protection work forum of the 
National People's Congress [NPC] was held in Jinan on 15 
December. This forum was primarily devoted to studying how to 
orient the protection of environment and natural resources to 
the demands of the new situation and to explore how to take up 
the new challenges facing environmental protection. 
  Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the NPC, made a speech at 
the 
forum. He said: As a fundamental national policy of our 
country, environmental protection has always attracted high 
attention from the party and the state. The vast numbers of the 
people have also strongly demanded the prevention and control of 
pollution and improvement of the ecological environment. 
Therefore, party and government leaders at all levels should 
actually list environmental protection work as a major item on 
their daily agenda and strive to do the work well. The NPC and 
the people's congress of various provinces, autonomous regions, 
and municipalities should accelerate the pace of protecting 
environment and further strengthen inspection and supervision 
over the implementation of the laws on environmental protection 
in order to give rise to a new situation in which the NPC, 
people's congresses at various levels, governments at various 
levels, various circles in society, and the broad masses of the 
people make concerted efforts to manage the work altogether. 
  At the forum, Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the 
provincial 
party committee and governor of the province, extended a welcome 
to the comrades of the environmental protection committee under 
the NPC and the comrades from various fraternal provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions, on behalf of the 
provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress 
standing committee, and the provincial government. 
  Qu Geping, vice chairman of the environmental protection 
committee under the NPC, presided over the forum and made a 
report entitled "People's Congresses at All Levels Should 
Strengthen the Protection of Environment and Natural Resources." 
Attending the forum were Lin Zongtang, Yang Jike, Qin Zhongda, 
and Yang Zhenhuai, vice chairmen of the environmental protection 
committee under the NPC; and Li Zhen, chairman of the Shandong 
Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee.

  [Text] Beijing, December 22 (XINHUA) -- China has 
introduced a licensing system to control the exploitation of 
bears, an official said here today. 
  Shen Maocheng, vice-minister of the forestry, said that 
China 
has no plan to breed more bears and it will close those breeding 
lots that do not meet minimum conditions. 
  At a press conference hosted by the Information Office under 
the State Council, Shen said that though China is abundant in 
bears, it has barred hunting bears since 1989, when the animal 
came under national protection. 
  He said that most bears living in the country's feed lots 
were captured before 1989. Since then, China has not approved 
any hunting of wild bears. 
  Bear gut, obtained by killing a bear, is a traditional 
Chinese medicine. To protect its bear resources, China began in 
the 1980's to drain bile from breeding bears. 
  He said that draining a bear's bile in a breed lot saves 44 
wild bears. If one bear's bile can be drained for five years, 
that would save 220 wild bears. 
  He said that the technique is scientific. Moreover, it is 
not only bearable, but also painless to the bear. And it 
imposes no negative effects on the growth and reproduction of 
the animal. 
  "The method not only protects the wild bear, but also 
provides bile to meet the demands of the domestic market," he 
said. 
  The method also complies with international norms on the 
protection of wild animals, according to the official.

  [Text] Urumqi, December 28 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has made unremitting efforts to 
provide the local wildlife with a better environment in recent 
years. 
  So far, the region has built 20, and plans another ten, 
nature reserves, eight of which are nature reserves of wild 
animals. 
  Covering an area of 1.6 million sq km, Xinjiang has 773 
species of vertebrate animals. Some of them are found in 
Xinjiang only; they include the Tarim hare and Tarim red deer. 
Some others such as wild horses, wild donkeys and wild camels 
are considered endangered species worldwide. 
  While firmly following state laws and regulations on the 
protection of wildlife, the region has promulgated a series of 
local regulations on protection of wildlife in its vast 
territory. 
  At the same time, the region's governments at all levels 
have 
paid attention to severely punishing people engaging in illegal 
activities such as poaching and trading in protected animals. 
  Besides government departments and personnel specializing in 
protection of wildlife, many mass organizations have been 
established in recent years to help protect wild animals. 
  As a result of these comprehensive measures, the living 
environment for wild animals in the region has been markedly 
improved and the number of wild animals has increased 
substantially. For example, the number of wild horses introduced 
from Germany, the United States and Britain has grown from 13 in 
1985 to 49.

  [Text] Beijing, January 3 (XINHUA) -- To continue 
perfecting the legislation for environmental protection is a 
major task in 1994, State Councillor Song Jian said here today. 
  He urged that close attention should be paid to coping with 
the relationship between economic construction and environmental 
protection in the light of China's fast economic growth. 
  Song, also director of the Environmental Protection 
Committee 
of the State Council, told XINHUA that the work of environmental 
protection faces new opportunities and challenges in the new 
situation this year. 
  To meet the demand of the establishment of a sound socialist 
market economic structure, he said, a range of laws and 
regulations concerning environmental protection will be enacted 
in the new year. 
  He also said that the supervision and inspection of the 
implementation of the environmental laws and regulations should 
be further strengthened. 
  In addition, efforts should be made to raise the 
consciousness of the importance of environmental protection 
among the whole nation, he said. People from all walks of life, 
he stressed, should be encouraged to take part in the work of 
environmental monitoring and control. 
  He noted that those who break the environmental protection 
laws should be punished severely. 
  The State Councillor said that emphasis should be placed on 
tackling pollution, and various kinds of actions should be taken 
to protect precious wild animals and plants. 
  He stressed that the work of environmental protection should 
be brought into the scope of policymaking of governments at all 
levels.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Fujian in southeast 
China is now top of the league of China's provinces in forest 
cover. 
  According to the fourth national survey of forest resources, 
trees cover 6.148 million hectares in Fujian, an increase of 
1.145 million hectares over 1988, and its timber reserves total 
395 million cubic meters, up 15.77 million cubic meters. 
  The forest cover in the province is 52.4 percent, giving it 
the lead among provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions 
on the mainland, and 9.2 percentage points more than in 1988. 
  Fujian's territory includes 80 percent of hilly areas 
suitable for tree planting. It has become one of China's key 
timber producers. 
  A provincial official in charge of forestry disclosed that 
the province has formed a complete forest industrial set-up over 
the past four decades. 
  At present, the province has afforestation areas totalling 
1.81 million hectares, 500,000 hectares more than five years ago 
and an increase of 6.4 percent annually. 
  The official noted that the success resulted from scientific 
planting and administrative measures to ban indiscriminate 
felling of trees.

  [Text] Sydney, Dec 11 (AFP) -- Britain has closed the door 
on a controversial part of its relationship with Australia by 
agreeing to pay a 45 million dollar [Australian dollars] (30 
million U.S.) settlement over sites it once used for nuclear 
tests, Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner said Saturday. 
  The ex-gratia payment ends a long-running dispute over the 
clean-up of British test sites at Maralinga, Monte Bello Islands 
and Emu Field in the southern Australian outback. 
  Australia has long argued that it was Britain's 
responsibility to clean up the nuclear contamination which it 
claims still affects the lives of local Aborigines. 
  "The British decision is welcomed, it will allow Britain and 
Australia to put behind us one of the saddest aspects of our 
relationship," Tickner told AFP from Canberra. 
  "It is almost impossible to conceive now that atomic weapons 
were actually tested in Australia, they will leave a legacy of 
contamination for many thousands of years to come." 
  The indigenous Aborigine population was driven off its 
traditional lands to make way for the British nuclear tests and 
returned in the 1980s only to learn the area had been exposed to 
high levels of toxic contamination. 
  "As a result of the testing, Aboriginal people lost the use 
of their traditional lands, but the compensation will allow a 
clean-up and fencing where appropriate and will allow us to have 
a much more mature relationship between Britain and Australia," 
Tickner said. 
  The Aborigines filed a formal complaint to Britain in 1991, 
leading Australia to press Britain to share rehabilitation and 
compensation costs of the Maralinga nuclear testing range, 
abandoned by Britain in 1967. 
  The settlement, to be paid to Australia in installments over 
the next six years, removed a "major irritant" to the 
relationship between Australia and Britain, British Foreign 
Office Minister Alastair Goodlad said in London Friday. 
  Australia had agreed in turn to abandon all further claims, 
he said. 
  Australian Primary Industries and Energy Minister Simon 
Crean 
and Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said in a joint 
statement from Canberra that resolution of the issue had 
vindicated Australia's stance about the condition of the sites 
left by Britain. 
  "Australia has never accepted Britain's denial of legal or 
moral responsibility for this issue," the ministers said. The 
condition of the sites left by Britain "was unacceptable even by 
the standards that then applied." 
  A study by Australian, British and U.S. scientists, 
completed 
in 1990, traced the full extent of plutonium on Aborginial land 
and found that the Aborgines' outdoor lifestyle made them highly 
vulnerable to the threat of plutonium, a carcinogen.

  [Text] The forest industry say they have nothing to fear 
from the world's newly-effective biological diversity agreement. 
The international convention on biological diversity agreed 
upon at the Earth Summit in the Brazilian capital, Rio de 
Janerio, 18 months ago came into effect yesterday. Under the 
agreement, companies will have to pay royalties to states or 
nations if they want access to native plants and animals. Jim 
Divine of the Association of Forest Industries says that by any 
international standard, Australia's forest practices are a model 
of sustainability. 
  [Begin Divine recording] With more than 100 years 
of operation, managed forest logging in this country has not 
resulted in any extinction or loss of a single animal or plant 
species. The other thing is the fact that we are working to 
sustain the yield patterns and we are working in less than one 
percent of the forest to (?state) annually [End 
recording]. 
  State governments are expected to start work in the new year 
on a new strategy to preserve the nation's genetic material. 
The strategy is the first step towards implementing the 
international biodiversity agreement. Under the agreement, 
companies will be forced to pay royalties to states or nations 
if they want access to native plants and animals. The worldwide 
fund for nature which took part in the negotiations says the 
agreement will help ensure biological resources are used 
sustainably. A consultant for the organization, Alistair 
Graham, says its now up to the states to work out royalties. 
  [Begin Graham recording] It will be state 
governments who can be expected to assert proprietor ownership 
of wild biological resources and they are the ones that would 
have the commercial interest to negotiate such royalty or rental 
payments. And it will be up to them and it has to be said that 
on the basis of past experience on royalties of minerals or 
wood, they may not do very well. But at least the opportunity 
is there [End recording].

  [Text] Rangoon, Dec 24 (AFP) -- The Burmese timber 
industry, the country's leading foreign exchange earner, is 
actively courting foreign investors while promoting sound 
ecological principles. 
  And its forestry conservation practices have enabled the 
government to reap rare accolades from a Western world which was 
outspoken in its criticism of the military junta's takeover 
after public demonstrations five years ago. 
  "Burma gets a bum rap" on logging practices, an otherwise- 
critical foreign observer commented. "The government is 
repressive, but its conservation policies are enlightened," a 
Western diplomat said. 
  With about 75 percent of the world's teak reserves and a 
large quantity of other hardwoods, Rangoon has invited up to 100 
percent foreign investment in everything from sawmills to 
furniture factories to gain sorely-needed funds for development. 
  It intends, however, to maintain strict control of logging 
operations in order to preserve its forest resources for the 
future, officials stressed in recent interviews here. 
  About half the country is covered in forests, and officials 
said that so far only three million cubic meters (105 million 
cubic yards) of wood had been cut, compared to 40 million cubic 
meters (1,400 cubic yards) in Malaysia, which is half the size 
of Burma. 
  Before neighboring Thailand banned logging on its own 
territory in 1988, it had almost halved its forest cover. 
  When Rangoon called a halt early last year to allegedly 
abusive Thai logging in concessions along the border, it 
adjusted its income targets accordingly, planning a 6.9 percent 
GDP drop in the forestry sector. 
  In the 1994-95 fiscal year, starting April 1, it hopes to 
see 
a new rise in income as investors from places such as Sweden and 
Thailand come on stream with renovations to local hardwood 
furniture factories. 
  But would-be foreign investors are mainly looking for big 
profits and a quick return, instead of taking a longer view, 
officials of the Forestry Department and the state-run Myanmar 
Timber Enterprise complained. 
  They said they need equipment--including tractors, skidders 
and road-building machinery to help speed up extraction and 
delivery to the investors--as well as marketing and technology 
knowhow. 
  From the felling of a tree to the factory can take up to two 
years. "The faster we can do it, the faster we can produce 
downstream products," one official said. 
  But all officials, including Forestry Minister Lieutenant 
General Chit Swe, stressed that Burma's future resources would 
not be sacrificed. 
  Interviewed surrounded by top aides and advisors, the 
minister, a member of the ruling junta, noted that no one else 
in the group was wearing military dress. 
  "I'm the only one wearing the green," he said, tugging at 
the 
sleeve of his forest-green uniform. "I like green. I am a 
conservationist." 
  His statement was backed up separately by other officials, 
one of whom said: "The minister is a fanatic. He doesn't want to 
fell any trees. He wants to lower the quota. What he wants are 
natural parks, wildlife, eco-tourism." 
  Under a system of selective felling on a sustainable basis, 
the Forestry Department allocates a quota of Annual Allowable 
Cuts (AAC) for all commercial varieties in strictly-defined 
sites. 
  Loggers could harvest up to 350,000 tonnes of teak and 1.3 
million tonnes of other hardwoods annually without endangering 
future extraction, according to official calculations. 
  Actual figures stand at approximately 250,000 tonnes and 
500,000 tonnes -- due in part to equipment shortages, officials 
acknowledged. 
  They also said the shortfall compensated for remote areas 
outside their control along the borders--estimated by one 
official at "maybe 5-7 percent" but which foreign analysts put 
at between 15 and 20 percent. 
  The ministry meanwhile replants some 80,000 acres (200,000 
hectares) a year, half in teak and other hardwoods. Much of the 
rest is devoted to faster-growing trees to be used for the fuel 
on which 70 percent of the population is dependent.

  The Vienna Convention provides a framework containing an 
agreement in principle to cooperate in protection of the ozone 
layer and the Montreal Protocol classifies actions to phase out 
the ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons, 
CFC, by the end of this century. 
  As a party to the protocol, Myanmar will be spared from the 
trade restrictions imposed by the protocol and will be allowed 
to import controlled substances within a 10-year grace period 
for limited domestic use for refrigeration and air conditioning. 
  Additionally, the protocol will provide Myanmar assistance 
to 
obtain ozone friendly technology and financial assistance to 
affect the necessary readjustment. Furthermore, Myanmar's 
accession to these important instruments underlines its 
commitment and responsibility to protect the global environment. 
  Since the establishment of the National Commission for 
Environmental Affairs in February 1990, the Union of Myanmar 
signed in June 1992 the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, 24 Nov -- Several Indonesian 
businessmen have expressed their readiness to apply the 
eco-efficiency program to their industrial development strategy. 
This is intended to comply with the eco-labelling policy and at 
the same time to practise the principle of sustainable 
development. 
  Mohamed Hasan, chairman of the Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (MUIPB), addressed a meeting on 
enforcing the eco- efficiency program in current industrial 
development in Jakarta on 23 November. [passage omitted] 
  Professor Dr. Otto Sumarwoto, executive director of MUIPB, 
said an industry must improve its production efficiency and 
comply with enviromental regulations as required by the society. 
  The environmental expert from the Bandung-based University 
of 
Pajajaran said that lately the government has been encouraging 
industrialists to advocate the principles of environmental 
protection by adopting environmental regulations and making 
structural changes in their production processes. However, 
members of the international community who are consumers should 
also boycott goods whose production processes produce 
environmentally harmful waste. [passage omitted] 
  According to Otto, basically, the eco-efficiency program is 
an effort to urge industries to use efficient raw materials that 
will reduce pollution output. In this way, the industries are 
minimizing the environmental impact. In view of this, the 
eco-efficiency program not only requires industries to abide by 
the people's demand for environmental protection, it also 
provides the industries with competitiveness and increases their 
profits over the long term. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Revealing the Names of Industries Responsible </F>
for Environmental Pollution"] 
  [Text] Sarwono, minister of state for the environment, 
spoke at a news conference following his meeting with Vice 
President Try Sutrisno in Jakarta on Wednesday, 15 December. It 
is interesting to note Sarwono's suggestion that the identity of 
those responsible for polluting the environment be revealed in 
the newspapers. He said it is only proper that the names of 
these businessmen or industries be identified clearly and not 
just by their initials. 
  The minister said this is one of the steps the Environmental 
Impact Management Agency will take at its next national working 
meeting on the clean river project, and will be implemented next 
year. 
  Minister Sarwono stressed that the press should not hesitate 
to reveal in detail the names of industries that are not 
concerned about the environment, or whose products and 
technology endanger the lives of their workers. He added that 
it is not sufficient for the press to publish their initials. 
He reiterated that if the press is confident that their 
information is accurate, they should not fear any resulting 
legal charges, because they will definitely win the case. 
  We say that the minister's suggestion is interesting because 
this is something new for our national press. Based on the 
principles of the journalistic code of ethics observed by 
members of the PWI (Indonesian Journalists Association), all 
journalists should honor an individual's privacy and not violate 
the principle of presumption of innocence [preceding three words 
in English]. This code of ethics is clearly spelled out in the 
PWI's journalistic code--an individual should be regarded as 
innocent until a decision is issued in court. 
  The Indonesian press is required to honor its journalistic 
code of ethics as stipulated by the PWI statue. The press 
should use wisdom and tact before it reveals the full name and 
identity or publishes a photograph of any person. One of the 
code's rules relates to the presumption of innocence, which 
requires the press to refrain from indirectly accusing a suspect 
of committing a crime or revealing his or her full identity 
until he or she is convicted in court. This is guaranteed in 
the PWI's journalistic code of ethics under Section 8 of Law No. 
14/1970. 
  We feel that it would be very difficult for the national 
press to violate the code of ethics, the law, and the order that 
are the basis of their profession. There has never been a case 
where journalists have been charged in court for reporting 
inaccurate information and ordered to pay an exorbitant amount 
to the plaintiff in damages. 
  In view of recent cases where people felt defamed by press 
reports and pressed for legal charges against the journalist 
concerned, we also find that some journalists are being 
blackmailed and an unbelievable amount of money is being 
extorted. 
  The PWI, as a professional organization for journalists, has 
thus far been able to impose discipline and enforce its 
journalist code of ethics for reporting on the national press. 
  Addressing the 19th PWI Congress in Bandar Lampung from 2 to 
5 December, Information Minister Harmoko reminded the PWI and 
its honorary board members of their unflinching obligation to 
uphold justice, defend the people's interests for the sake of 
the law, and take disciplinary action against members who 
violate the journalistic code of ethics. 
  We fully understand Minister Sarwono's objective in saying 
that the identity of industries proven to have caused 
environmental pollution should be revealed in the press. Such 
transparent reporting would force businessmen to be more serious 
about producing products and following production processes that 
do not harm the environment. But if the press reveals the 
identity of the industry causing industrial pollution, and at 
the end of the trial the court cannot convict the industry 
because of lack of evidence, who can guarantee that the 
publication in question will be free from countercharges and 
demands for compensation?

summit meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Koichiro Matsuura told a joint press conference. 
  Japan and the U.S. reached the agreement during a second 
round of talks on a common agenda for global cooperation under a 
trade framework agreement reached between the two nations in 
July. 
  The meeting was held Wednesday morning at the Foreign 
Ministry. Matsuura headed the Japanese delegation and the U.S. 
side was led by Timothy Wirth, a State Department counselor. 
  During the meeting, Japan and the U.S. agreed that Russia's 
dumping of radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan was a 
"regrettable" act and agreed to continue exchanging information 
and discussing the matter, Matsuura said. 
  James Baker, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for oceanic and 
atmospheric affairs, told the news conference the countries 
strongly oppose any dumping of radioactive waste under the 
London Dumping Convention. 
  "We believe that Russians have acted in violation of the 
agreement by the London Dumping Convention," Baker said. 
  "Our joint support of the ban on dumping has been an 
important new step here," he said. 
  The two sides agreed to start a fellowship program for 
engineers from January. Some 30 U.S. engineers from companies 
such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will study for a 
year at Japanese firms like Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor 
Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Sony Corp. 
  For the next fiscal year, about 100 engineers will come to 
Japan under the fellowship. 
  Japan and the U.S. also discussed setting up a committee to 
cooperate on improvement of the environment in central and 
eastern Europe and are close to agreement on its establishment, 
Matsuura said. 
  Wirth said the two nations' cooperation in the area will 
make 
a "significant contribution in helping clean up enormous 
environmental problems that plague" the region.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec 15 KYODO -- A government report on toxic 
chemical residues in the environment in 1992 claims the 
Environment Agency's restrictions on use of toxic tin compounds 
in paint on boat keels are beginning to have an effect. 
  The compounds are blamed for contaminating marine life. 
  The report, submitted to a subcommittee on chemical 
substances within the agency's central council for environmental 
pollution control, said there has been a slight improvement in 
the level of contamination from the compounds in the two years 
since the introduction of the restrictions. 
  But the report also said contamination from toxic 
substances, 
including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and dioxins, though at 
low levels, is still continuing. 
  In a survey of 17 potentially harmful substances, eight, 
including the herbicide simetryn, were found in water and fish. 
  The substances are only mildly toxic and were detected in 
small amounts, but the report said more investigation is 
required since simetryn is reportedly capable of affecting 
marine plants at even low concentrations. 
  The report also said PCB was detected in 37 of 72 samples of 
sea bass and other fish taken from Tokyo bay and other parts of 
the country. 
  Dioxins, some known for their high toxicity, were present in 
silt at the bottom of Tokyo, Ise, and Osaka bays. The densities 
and frequency of occurrence were the same as in 1991. 
  A spokesman for the agency said they are unlikely to have an 
impact on humans, but noted that there is a need to assess the 
distribution because of the apparently wide area in which they 
are found.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 21 KYODO -- Japan agreed Tuesday [21 
December] to study the possibility of providing Russia with an 
emergency storage facility such as a chemical tanker to hold 
liquid radioactive waste that might otherwise be dumped into the 
ocean, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Japan agreed to consider the Russian request for the 
emergency storage facility at a bilateral experts' meeting held 
at the Foreign Ministry, the officials said. 
  The two sides reconfirmed that it is essential to prevent 
further dumping of low-level liquid radioactive waste into the 
ocean by Russia, they said. 
  Russia told Japan it is storing about 1,900 tons of liquid 
radioactive waste in four vessels and other facilities around 
Vladivostok but that the storage capacity is nearly full. 
  The environment in the Russian Far East is in "critical" 
danger because, for example, one of the old vessels storing the 
liquid radioactive waste has a hole in it that might pose a 
threat in bad weather, the Russian delegation was quoted as 
saying. 
  Russia explained that emergency measures are necessary to 
cope with the situation and asked for Japanese cooperation in 
finding a chemical tanker with a storage capacity of between 
5,000 tons and 25,000 tons, the officials said. 
  An estimated 5,000 tons of liquid radioactive waste are 
generated annually in Russia as a result of the dismantling of 
nuclear-powered submarines. 
  A 100 million dollar fund pledged by Japan to Moscow to help 
Russia scrap its obsolete nuclear weapons will be utilized to 
purchase the tanker or some other facility for emergency 
storage, they said. The tanker would be a used one, since it 
would take more than a year to build a new one. 
  The two sides agreed to hold another experts' meeting in 
Moscow in early January to further discuss the matter, they said. 
  Russia dumped 900 tons of liquid nuclear waste into the Sea 
of Japan on October 17. It suspended a planned second dumping 
following international protests, particularly from Japan and 
South Korea. 
  Tuesday's meeting was attended by Russian First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Michail Kokeev and five other officials from 
the Atomic Energy Ministry, the Navy and the Pacific Fleet. 
  The Japanese group was headed by Yukiya Amano, director of 
the Foreign Ministry's Science and Nuclear Energy Division. 
Officials from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
and Science and Technology Agency also attended. 
  At the meeting, Japan and Russia also reconfirmed plans to 
conduct joint research on the Sea of Japan in mid-January, the 
officials said. 
  South Korea will also take part in the joint research, which 
will sample both water and sediment around the point where 
Russia dumped the waste in October. Officials from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) may also be aboard the 
research ship, they said. 
  The Japanese and Russian delegations also basically agreed 
to 
conduct a second joint research expedition next summer if 
possible, they said. 
  The two sides will hold a joint working group meeting in 
Tokyo in March to discuss the results of January's joint survey, 
details of the proposed second investigation and other problems 
involving the storage of radioactive waste, they said. 
  On Wednesday, the Russian delegation will visit radioactive 
waste storage and processing facilities in the village of Tokai 
in Ibaraki Prefecture, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 22 KYODO -- Russia's dumping of liquid 
nuclear waste did not have any impact on marine life in the Sea 
of Japan, the government said in an interim report Wednesday [22 
December]. 
  The Maritime Safety Agency, the Meteorological Agency and 
the 
Fisheries Agency jointly conducted the survey at 14 sites in the 
Sea of Japan shortly after Russia dumped 900 tons of low-level 
liquid nuclear waste at sea in mid-October some 550 kilometers 
west of Hokkaido. 
  Judging from preliminary results, however, fish and other 
seafood analyzed were not more contaminated by radiation than in 
previous surveys. 
  The samples were taken from Japanese fishing grounds, which 
are some 200 kilometers away from the dumping site. A survey of 
the area close to the site is expected to be carried out in 
cooperation with Russia and South Korea soon, but not before 
mid-January, officials said. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Pacific fleet told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE the fleet does not intend to resume nuclear waste 
dumping in the near future or to ask Moscow to issue a relevant 
permit. 
  A scheduled second dumping in October was canceled following 
international protests, especially from neighboring Japan and 
South Korea, over the danger of contaminating the environment. 
  Despite the halt to dumping other potential risks remain, 
the 
spokesman said. The fleet has reportedly passed its storage 
capacity for liquid nuclear waste and the tankers carrying the 
dangerous cargo are outdated, he said. 
  In talks with Russian officials and experts on the nuclear 
waste issue on Tuesday, Japan basically agreed it will supply a 
tanker to help Russia over the storage bottleneck. 
  "If this is realized, I think we can avoid the resumption of 
dumping for the time being," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 6 KYODO -- Japan will dispatch a 
research ship to the North Pacific on a one-month mission to 
investigate the cause of the global warming phenomenon, the 
Fishery Agency said Thursday [6 January]. 
  The 2,000-ton Kaiyo Maru will set out Friday on the mission 
that is part of a 42-nation, 10-year project, known as the World 
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the agency said. 
  The WOCE was launched in 1990 as a multilateral project to 
counteract the threat from global warming, which some scientists 
warn could make the earth uninhabitable for living creatures in 
the long run. 
  The scientists warn the burning of oil and other fossil 
fuels 
would boost the average temperature of the atmosphere by 
trapping heat from the earth's surface with an increasing 
density of carbon dioxide that prevents the dissipation of heat 
into space. 
  Under the WOCE, Japan is entrusted with investigating global 
warming in five broad areas. 
  This year, Japan will probe the phenomenon at 70 locations 
along the line of 30 degree latitude in a broad area of the 
North Pacific between the Japanese archipelago and the west 
coast of the United States. 
  The ship will measure the density of carbon dioxide and 
salinity and the temperatures of seawater at these 70 sites at 
intervals of 50 to 70 kilometers, the agency said. 
  On top of the research related to the global warming, the 
ship will investigate the living environment of tuna and other 
migratory fish at 90 locations to help assess the future 
conditions of fishery resources, it added.

  [Text] Niigata, Jan. 7 KYODO -- A team of Japanese and U.S. 
Researchers have found a new organism that eats polychlorinated 
biphenyl (PCB), a poisonous pollutant, group members said Friday 
[7 January]. 
  Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata Prefecture and 
Michigan State University in the United States jointly 
discovered the microbe, temporarily named Rh1, that could help 
solve the problem of how to safely dispose of the toxic chemical. 
  Rh1, which propagates in soil, seems to be the most 
effective 
of the dozens of PCB-eating microbes that have been found since 
1973, the members said. 
  PCB is formed by dozens of constituent elements of 
chlorinated carbon compounds. Rh1 resolves most of the 
elements, whereas previously discovered PCB-consuming microbes 
break down only some of them, the researchers said. 
  The team found the microbe in soil containing an 
agricultural 
chemical with a structure similar to PCB, they said. 
  They confirmed the effectiveness of the bacteria in tests on 
low densities of PCB, said Masao Fukuda, an assistant professor 
at the Japanese institute. 
  The group will try to upgrade Rh1 by gene recombination so 
that it can be used for high-density concentrations of PCB, and 
also examine if the byproducts of the bacterial action are safe, 
he said. 
  PCB was used in a wide variety of industrial applications as 
a heating fluid and electrical insulator, but is no longer 
produced because it was found to be a poisonous environmental 
pollutant.

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 13 (KCNA) -- The chairman of the 
State Fisheries Commission of the DPRK issued a statement 
Monday, condemning Russia and Japan for having polluted to a 
great extent the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific by dumping 
large quantities of nuclear waste for over 30 years. 
  Far from lending an ear to criticism from the world public, 
Russia has announced that it would continue nuclear waste 
dumping in the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific, and Japan 
tries to avoid criticism, alleging that the nuclear waste it has 
dumped is not dangerous, the statement says, and continues: 
  It is impudent of Russia and Japan to talk about the DPRK's 
"compliance with the nuclear safeguards agreement" while 
wantonly violating international accord without an elementary 
morality. 
  Russia and Japan must refrain from their reckless act of 
decrying the DPRK, immediately stop dumping nuclear waste in the 
East Sea of Korea and the Pacific, apologize to the countries in 
the coastal areas, scoop up the dumped nuclear waste out of the 
sea at once and punish those responsible for the dumping. 
  We hope all the international organisations and community 
will pay deep attention to the destruction of sea biological 
resources by Russia and Japan and its consequences and take 
relevant measures.

  [Text] Samsung Petrochemical Co. has recently developed a 
new environment-friendly synthetic resin that can decay far more 
quickly than current degradable resins, a company spokesman said 
yesterday. 
  The resin decomposes within 60 to 80 days of being discarded 
and buried. When exposed to light for 30 days continuously, it 
totally poses its function as plastic, leaving for less 
environmental pollution, he said. 
  Developed by the company's umbrella research institute in 
Taejon, the bio-photo-degradable polyethylene resin is a 
commingling of polyethylene resin, and starch and other fillers 
which facilitate decomposition by germs and light. 
  The resin can be widely used for making vinyl bags and 
packing materials for a range of products, contributing to 
lowering environmental pollution, he said. 
  An ordinary degradable resin, when thrown away and buried, 
takes nearly five years to disintegrate. After disintegration, 
it still remains underground, polluting soil and ground water, 
he added. 
  The Samsung Group subsidiary, which has already begun 
production and sales of the new product, expects a high demand 
for the product both at home and abroad, given the growing 
worldwide awakening to environmental issues and the product's 
high quality. 
  Next year, the company, anticipating a 30 percent 
year-on-year growth in domestic demand, plans to produce some 
20,000 tons of the bio-photo-degradable resin, priced at roughly 
800,000 won ($1,000) per ton. 
  "We will have ample domestic demand as environment-conscious 
consumers are expected to seek out less environmentally harmful 
plastic bags," the spokesman forecast. 
  The company also aims to export the new resin as well as its 
manufacturing technology to the United States, Japan and EC 
nations where the use of degradable resins is mandatory, the 
spokesman said. 
  In addition, he said, the new resin will have an effect of 
import replacements worth 8 billion won by sharply bringing down 
the prices of photo-degradable resins sold in the country. 
  Based on the product's potentiality, Samsung plans to make 
efforts to develop new uses and expand its supply, he said. 
  The company, meanwhile, has already applied for a patent for 
two skills in manufacturing the resin, and is also pushing ahead 
with getting an international patent, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Vientiane, Dec 23 (KPL) -- The Asian Development 
Bank (ADB), on 22 December, approved a loan and two technical 
assistance grants totalling 13.2 million U.S. dollars to Laos to 
develop tree plantations, according to XINHUA. 
  ADB said the plantation project, which is to cover 9,000 
hectares, will increase annual wood production by 128,000 cubic 
meters and to reduce pressure on exploitation of natural forests. 
  The bank noted that the overwhelming dependence of Lao 
economy on forest resources has led to a rapid decline of forest 
cover in the country. 
  To check the rapid depletion of the country's forest 
resources, the Lao government has launched a new system of 
forest resource management to classify forest land into 
production, protection and conservation, and reforestation areas. 
  The plantation project, a part of the new system, is to be 
carried out in eight districts in Vientiane Prefecture and the 
Provinces of Vientiane, Bolikhamsai and Savannakhet to 
reestablish tree cover on unstocked and degraded forest lands.

  [Text] Jakarta, Dec. 10 (BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Indonesia have agreed to intensify cooperation in forestry 
research and exchange programme of forest experts in efforts to 
counter anti-tropical woods campaigns by developed countries. 
Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo said the 
cooperation would focus mainly on research and studies of 
tropical forests such as rattan, bamboos, and rubber. Malaysia 
and Indonesia view the cooperation very important because they 
share common problems in dealing with anti- tropical wood 
campaigns by advanced countries, he said in Surabaya, East Java 
last night. Jamaludin and his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk Sri 
Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, attended a dinner hosted by East Java 
Governor Basofi Sudirman in conjunction with the annual meeting 
of 38 forest experts from the two countries which is due to last 
[to] tomorrow. Jamaludin said both sides would intensify 
information exchange on tropical forest development and 
management system in efforts to confront anti-tropical wood 
campaigns sponsored by industrialised countries. We share a 
common political will with Malaysia to counter those who accuse 
developing nations of uncontrolled exploitation of tropical 
woods, he said. Such accusations are unfounded, he said, adding 
that Indonesia has always maintained a strict policy on forest 
preservation. Jamaludin said Indonesia with a large area of 
tropical forests would be playing a key role among ASEAN 
countries to counter such campaigns. The four-day meeting in 
Surabaya is the sixth such annual gathering among experts of the 
two countries.

  [Text] Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA) -- The Geneva-based Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species [CITES], a 
UN-sponsored animal conservation organization, has proposed that 
Taiwan step up controls on the management of rhino horn and 
tiger bone stockpiles. 
  In a letter to the Council of Agriculture, CITES recommended 
that all rhino horn and tiger bone held by individuals be placed 
under government control at an appointed venue. 
  The letter came about three weeks after CITES had sent 
officials to Taiwan on a fact-finding mission. A CITES 
committee voted 3-3 earlier this year to postpone trade 
sanctions proposed by Britain's Environmental Investigation 
Agency, which claimed Taiwan has only perfunctorily cracked down 
on the illegal trade of rhino horn and tiger bone. 
  However, Tang Hsiao-yu, a COA section chief in charge of 
conservation affairs, indicated Tuesday [28 December] that 
implementing the latest CITES proposal would be difficult 
because the government cannot force the public to surrender 
private property. 
  CITES suggested in its letter that the ROC add a provision 
to 
its existing wildlife conservation law mandating individuals to 
register any rhino horn or tiger bone they own, and that a 
special government agency be organized to crack down on trading 
of endangered species on the island. 
  It also proposed that the government strengthen coordination 
with other countries, including Mainland China, to combat 
smuggling of endangered species.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan. 5 (CNA) -- A second delegation from 
the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species 
(CITES) is scheduled to visit Taiwan later this month to 
reassess Taiwan's wildlife conservation efforts. 
  CITES spokesman Le Duc said the delegation will be comprised 
of four or five standing committee members, who will deliver a 
report to the full committee in March in Geneva, after which a 
final decision will be made on whether to recommend trade 
sanctions against Taiwan. 
  The CITES standing committee voted 3-3 in a September 
meeting 
last year to postpone trade sanctions proposed by Britain's 
Environmental Investigation Agency, which claimed Taiwan had 
only perfunctorily cracked down on the illegal trade of rhino 
horn and tiger parts. 
  The first cites delegation -- a lower-ranking trio -- 
visited 
Taiwan Nov. 28-Dec. 2. Its report was positive on Taiwan's 
conservation efforts. 
  Murray Hosking, a CITES standing committee member from New 
Zealand, will lead the second CITES delegation to Taiwan around 
the end of January after the delegation visits South Korea, Le 
Duc said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Chuan Must Turn Words Into Deeds"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai hit the nail on the 
head when he declared on Wednesday that his Government did not 
want rapid economic growth to proceed at the expense of the 
environment and social development. This praiseworthy pledge 
came amid predictions that the country's gross domestic product 
would grow by 8 to 8.5 percent next year, up from anticipated 
growth of 7.5 percent this year. 
  But achieving the worthy goal of progress without pain and 
pollution is going to take a lot more than mere words. One 
major weapon at his disposal is the Environment Protection 
Act--a legacy of the Anan Panyarachun administration. It 
provides the mechanism and opportunity with which to curb the 
activities of greed-obsessed, influential proponents of 
development at any cost. But awareness of the spirit behind the 
act, as well as the law itself, has yet to make much of an 
impact on the bureaucracy charged with enforcing it. 
  There is a crying need to educate the educators and launch a 
well-coordinated environmental awareness campaign among 
government units and members of the general public. The Act can 
provide a national blueprint for cleaning and preserving our 
natural environment, but this will require the kind of firm 
central direction that Mr Chuan seems to have in mind. To put 
it even more simply, its provisions must be enforced. 
  The environment--our air, water, land, forests and other 
natural gifts of our country--belong to all of us. As we have 
said before and will stress again, this includes not only the 
Government and profit-making businesses but also the farmers and 
the assembly-line workers, city-dwellers and rural villagers, 
military and civilian. No one among any of these groups has 
exclusivity. All of us have the responsibility of using 
resources without wasting them. 
  Like most people in the world, we have become aware in 
recent 
years that the richness of our country is not infinite. There 
is still, however, little which could be called a meeting of 
minds on how to deal with this growing problem. To some, it 
appears that each step forward on environmental matters is met 
with two steps backwards and there is a disconcerting lack of 
public debate on many issues which affect us all. Too often 
they tend to be presented to us as a fait accompli and then the 
avoidable agonising and demonstrations begin. The saga of the 
Pak Mun dam--rarely out of the headlines for long--provides a 
classic example of this. 
  Although we have a ministry of science, technology and 
environment there is a feeling that this government body does 
little more than pay lipservice to major environmental concerns. 
A broad segment of the population would welcome a ministry with 
the mandate to monitor and regulate all developments which fall 
under the general heading of environment but there is little 
evidence that this exists in an effective form. All concerned 
agencies should be gathered together under a single roof so they 
can coordinate with each other and work together, rather than 
against, each other. 
  A World Bank report recently noted that pollution in Asia is 
growing faster than the region's economies. Our economy doubled 
in size from 1975 to 1988, but industrial emissions grew 8 to 12 
times worse, the report says. No clearer indication is needed 
that it is time to stop the establishment of industries which 
pollute, and to force present-day polluters to clean up. There 
is no need for new laws or regulations in most cases. These 
exist in abundance. The problem is that they also exist in 
limbo, far too often. Enforcement of existing anti-pollution 
regulations and those governing illegal building would perform a 
near miracle to the beginning stage of a true, national 
environmental awareness campaign. At present we seem to support 
the principle rather than the act of conserving the environment. 
Take, for example, the concert outside Khao Yai National Park 
in October supposedly to promote environmental awareness. The 
irony was that afterwards the ground was strewn with rubbish. 
  A ministry or department charged with responsibility for the 
environment must not only have the powers to enforce these laws 
and regulations, but be willing to do so, even when this pits 
them against powerful special interest groups. If the 
Government is unwilling to use this power, then it cannot claim 
to be truly concerned about the environment. Such an entity 
must also be made to be responsive to the will of all Thais 
because the essence of democracy is that a government is 
answerable to its people. For a ministry of environment to be 
effective it must invite public debate. Such transparency would 
not only be "environmentally friendly"--it would also bring a 
breath of fresh air to the workings of government in a 
democratic society. 
  Only by adopting these measures can Mr. Chuan achieve his 
commendable goal.

  [Text] Hanoi, Dec. 18 (VNA) -- Vietnam now has around 20 
million hectares of forests and forestland; but this includes 
11.4 million hectares of bare hills and wasteland. Vietnam's 
forests cover 8.4 million hectares, and have a timber reserve of 
657.3 million cubic metres and about 5.5 billion bamboo trees. 
Of the reserve, timber [word indistinct] bamboo in production 
[words indistinct] 62 percent and 70 percent respectively. Half 
of the timber is found in the central highlands and more than 
20 percent is in the central coast areas. The [words 
indistinct] the size of protected forests increases every year, 
while production forests decline. This is because the rate of 
destruction is quicker than the growth rate of the trees. 
  Forests in Vietnam have suffered serious devastation over 
the 
past several decades, partly to bombardments and U.S. chemicals 
spraying during the Vietnam war, but mostly by indiscriminate 
tree felling for fuel, cultivation and construction, about

droughts and floods due to soil erosion, particularly areas on 
the coast. 
  Defoliant used by the U.S. have deprived Vietnam's forests 
of 
around 75 million cubic metres of timber worth billion of 
dollars. 
  To curb this alarming rate of deforestation, the best 
approach is to rely on the force of the population. The number 
living in the forest land is now estimated at 22 million persons. 
  Efforts have been made in recent years to allocate areas of 
forest for the long-term use of each farmer household. However, 
the results have been limited. Only 13,800 hectares with a 
timber reserve of 338,000 cubic metres have been allotted to 
families

  [Summary] "Dear friends, today the National Assembly held 
group discussions. In the morning, the National Assembly 
deputies discussed a draft law on environment protection. In the 
afternoon, they discussed a draft law on business bankruptcy." 
You, friends, are invited to listen to the following report on 
the National Assembly's group discussions on the draft law on 
environmental protection: 
  "The National Assembly reserved the whole morning session 
for 
deputies to discuss the draft law on environmental protection. 
The general views expressed by almost all the deputies at their 
group discussions asserted the need to promptly promulgate an 
environment law. Many deputies agreed with the goals of the 
draft law, namely, to prevent and overcome bad consequences 
caused by human beings and nature; and to rationally regulate 
the exploitation and use of the environment in support of 
long-term national construction." 
  Deputies contributed their views on every single chapter of 
the draft law. A Kien Giang Province deputy said the contents of 
the draft law were too general, especially with those measures 
to deal with environment violations. A Ho Chi Minh city deputy 
asked that the phrase "The Right to Live in a Healthy 
Environment Is a Human Right" be added to the preamble. 
  "The feasibility of this law was fervently discussed by the 
deputies. Many of them maintained that to make it possible for 
the law on environmental protection to enter into life, we 
should delegate localities with more powers, set up a government 
agency to provide guidance for environmental protection 
activities, and draw up clear-cut measures to deal with 
environment law violations." 
  Deputies from Minh Hai, Kien Giang, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh 
City said environmental pollution in urban areas is now 
relatively grave due to the presence of many heaps of garbage 
and the poor maintenance of public toilets. 
  Agriculturally, deputies from Ha Tay, Hoa Binh, Vinh Phu, 
and 
An Giang Provinces also complained about the indiscrimate use of 
insecticide by peasants, and this, according to them, has 
adversely affected livestocks and food products. Some deputies 
said overuse of fertilizer and insecticide has resulted in the 
extinction of almost all of useful creatures in ricefields such 
as frogs, crabs, and mollusks. A deputy denounced a paint 
factory in Ha Tay for pouring its industrial waste into the Song 
Nghe River, polluting it and killing fish in its hatcheries. 
  Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province Deputy Do Quoc Hung said: 
[begin recording] I think it is very necessary to 
promulgate this law, especially in the current circumstance. I 
agree with the proposal that we call this law the law on 
environmental protection [end recording]. 
  Recommending measures to overcome the state of environmental 
pollution, Kien Giang Province Deputy Nguyen Duc Thang said: 
[begin recording] In the Mekong River Delta, we 
should do away with the presence of latrines built along 
irrigation canals and ditches if we want to keep our environment 
clean and beautiful [end recording]. 
  Deputies from Ha Tay and Hoa Binh Provinces stated that 
while 
our country is stepping up the industrial process and broadening 
cooperation with foreign countries, the prompt promulgation of a 
law on environmental protection is very necessary. 
  Ha Tay Province Deputy Nguyen Phuc Dinh said: [begin 
recording]It is very necessary for the fourth session of 
the Ninth National Assembly to pass the law on environmental 
protection. This is because in national industrialization, we 
must specify which chemicals are toxic and harmful to health and 
which are not [end recording].

<F P=106> [Communique No. 12 issued by the Ninth National Assembly's </F>
Fourth Session in Hanoi on 27 December] 
  [Text] On the morning of 27 December 1993, the National 
Assembly deputies held group debates on the draft resolutions 
that will be presented to the National Assembly for approval at 
the end of this session. 
  On the afternoon of 27 December, under the direction of 
National Assembly Vice Chairman Phung Van Tuu, the National 
Assembly held a plenary session at the conference hall to pass 
the Law on Environmental Protection. 
  The National Assembly heard Mr. Luong Xuan Quy, a member of 
the meeting secretariat, read a report on behalf of the 
Secretariat, the Scrutiny Committee, and the Committee that 
drafted the law on the views contributed by National Assembly 
deputies regarding revision of the draft law. He also read the 
full text of the revised draft Law on Environmental Protection. 
  Next, 32 National Assembly deputies spoke on those articles 
of the draft law with which they still had differences. These 
deputies were: Nguyen Dinh Ngo of Thua Thien Hue; Nguyen Dinh 
Giang of Quang Ninh; Nguyen Viet Dung and Mai Thuc Lan of Ha 
Bac; Nguyen Minh Quang of Nam Ha; Do Quoc Hung of Ba Ria-Vung 
Tau; Nguyen Don of Quang Nam- Danang; Vu Dinh Cu and Tran Thi 
Tam Dan of Hanoi; Co Hoa Van of Lao Cai; Le Thi Thanh Liem and 
Tran Van Ngau of Ben Tre; Tran Minh Xuan of Khanh Hoa; Nguyen 
Ngoc Tran of An Giang; Le Khac Binh, Nguyen Tan Phat, Nguyen Van 
Thanh, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Phuong, and Chu Pham Ngoc Son of Ho Chi 
Minh City; Dang Huu of Binh Dinh; Pham Hung of Hai Hung; Tran 
Chu Toan of Gia Lai; Nguyen Duc Hoan of Quang Tri; Bui Ngoc 
Thanh of Lang Son; Nguyen Xuan Thiet and Dinh Xuan The of Vinh 
Phu; Nguyen Khac Tao of Ha Tinh; Nguyen Thi Hoai Thu of Tien 
Giang; Do Van An of Son La; Nguyen Quoc Thuc of Nghe An; Nguyen 
Van Thanh of Dong Nai; and Hoang Dinh Cau of Ha Tay. 
  The National Assembly then decided on those issues where 
there were still differences. 
  With a high identity of views, the National Assembly voted 
to 
pass the Law on Environmental Protection. This important law is 
designed to keep the environment clean, healthy, and beautiful; 
improve the environment; ensure ecological balance; prevent and 
overcome the harmful impact on the environment caused by human 
beings and the elements; and provide for the rational and 
thrifty exploitation and use of natural resources. 
  The National Assembly will continue its session at the 
conference hall on 28 December 1993.

  [Text] An environmental observatory has been set up in the 
Musala mountains in Bulgaria. This joint French and Bulgarian 
project was an initiative of J. Stamenov, director of the Sofia 
Nuclear Research Institute, and J.-P. Carbonnel, head of 
research at the CNRS [French National Center for Scientific 
Research] responsible for this project on behalf of the French 
Environment Ministry. The implementation of this project is the 
concrete result of the French Embassy's wish to come to the 
assistance of Bulgarian science. From 19 to 25 September, a 
summer university made it possible for research workers from the 
two countries to discuss the results of an initial field 
campaign to monitor the ecology of the Musala mountain range and 
consider future cooperation. For example, Meteo-France [French 
Meteorological Office] will supply two high- mountain 
meteorological stations, and the University of Franche- Comte 
will supply a complete set of equipment for continuously 
measuring radon in water. Moreover, the various Bulgarian 
laboratories involved will be linked up by a computer network, 
thanks to funding from the French Foreign Ministry. In order to 
optimize coordination of the cooperative efforts, a scientific 
interest grouping (GIS) will be set up this month in Paris.

  [Text] Sofia, December 14 (BTA) -- The chemical plant in 
Giurgiu has been shut down and will be brought on line only 
after the waste-treatment installation starts operating and 
Bulgarian experts establish that the plant will not pollute the 
air of Giurgiu and Ruse, the Romanian minister for water, 
forestry, and environmental protection Aurel Constantin Ilie 
told his Bulgarian counterpart Valentin Bosevski on the first 
day of a two-day working meeting. Since the early 1980's, the 
Giurgiu Chemical Plant has been the major polluter of the air of 
the Danubian city of Ruse. 
  The Romanian minister came to Bulgaria to work out a 
regional 
environmental programme aimed at the lower reaches of the 
Danube. On the basis of the programme the two ministers will 
sign a memorandum to the European Union to seek its support for 
the implementation of the programme. 
  The sides are pleased with the fact that the two countries 
are becoming increasingly active in European environmental 
policy. "The signing of the Convention on Black Sea Protection 
in Bucharest last year and the forthcoming endorsement of the 
Danubian Convention, which will take place in Sofia, go to show 
the will of Bulgaria and Romania to share in a very important 
process: the conservation of Europe's natural resources," Mr. 
Bosevski said. 
  Further talks between the two ministers will focus on a 
number of issues related to the finalizing of nuclear safety 
accords. The Romanian guest proposed that expert teams be set 
up to work in the sphere of nuclear safety and exercise 
reciprocal control. The sides are also expected to work out the 
status and composition of the inter-governmental commission on 
the implementation of the bilateral agreement on cooperation in 
environment protection.

  [Text] Sofia, December 15 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's Minister of 
the Environment Valentin Bosevski and Romania's visiting 
Minister of Waters, Forestry and Environment Protection Aurel 
Constantin Ilie today initialed the statutes of an 
intergovernmental commission to supervise the implementation of 
the bilateral convention on cooperation in environmental 
protection signed in Romania on May 12, 1993. The commission 
will hold its first sitting in early February, Bosevski told the 
press. 
  The ministers discussed the work on a regional programme for 
the environmental protection of the lower Danube. We think this 
programme can now only be implemented with intellectual and 
financial assistance from the European Union, Bosevski also 
said. He said this would not be unprecedented, as such 
programmes are under way in Central Europe. 
  The ministers agreed to sign in Giurgiu (Romania) on 
December 
27 a memorandum to the EC asking support for the implementation 
of the Regional Programme for Environmental Protection of the 
Lower Danube. The memorandum will be handed to the EC by January 
15. 
  "The time of promises has passed. My view, shared by Mr. 
Ilie, is that we shall be looking for pragmatic models to 
resolve environmental problems," said Bosevski. He said the 
Romanian side invited Bulgarian experts to visit the 
construction site of the N-plant [nuclear plant] in Cerna Voda.

  [Text] Sofia, Dec 20 (BTA) -- Today the cabinet approved 
Bulgaria's joining the Global Environment Facility (GEF) set up 
by the World Bank to finance major environmental projects. 
Bulgaria was granted GEF funds under two regional programmes 
for management of the Danubian and Black Sea environment. The 
facility helped Bulgaria launch a programme for bio-diversity 
conservation and improvement of the protected areas control 
system. Bulgaria's joining the GEF will allow for a more active 
participation in the facility's management, Minister of 
Environment Valentin Bosevski said, commenting on the cabinet's 
decision. It was clearly stated that it spells no direct 
financial commitments for this country. 
  In the 1993-94 period, the GEF extended a total of 150,000 
U.S. dollars. This figure is expected to reach 4 million U.S. 
dollars in 1995-97, which will help implement environmental 
projects.

  [Text] Sofia, Dec 28 (BTA) -- The ruling body of the Green 
Parliament today approved a comprehensive programme for 1994 at 
its last meeting this year, BTA learned from the organization. 
It was set up early this autumn by representatives of some 
twenty nongovernmental environmental organizations. A 
seven-member bureau was elected at the parliament's setting up 
to coordinate its activity. 
  The bureau today outlined major areas of activity in 1994: 
statutory regulations on nature conservation, programmes for 
environment-friendly production, raising environmental 
awareness, and protection for nature reserves. 
  Ecologists from the Green Parliament are drawing up a 
programme for environmental protection targeted on the economy. 
It will be submitted to the Ministries of Industry, Trade, and 
the Environment, as well as to the Parliamentary Commission for 
Ecology.

  [Text] Rozna, south Moravia, Dec 15 (CTK) -- 
Representatives of fifteen communities in the south Moravian 
district of Zdar nad Sazavou refuse to allow the Czech Energy 
Company CEZ to build a storage facility for spent fuel in that 
region. 
  The environment there is already threatened enough by 
uranium 
mines, settling basins for uranium ore dressing, and a storage 
facility for galvanic sludge, representatives said. Even the 
income and the jobs that the construction of a storage facility 
would bring to the region, whose unemployment rate is above the 
average for the Czech Republic, would not make up for the threat 
to the environment. 
  In the spring a meeting of all the mayors of communities on 
whose territories the storage facility might be constructed is 
to take place.

  [Text] Prague, Dec 20 (CTK) -- Czechs would be unwilling to 
pay higher taxes or to accept a lower standard of living for the 
sake of protecting the environment, but one quarter would be 
willing to pay more for products, a new STEM [Center for 
Empirical Research] poll reveals. 
  While 26.1 percent would accept higher prices, only 18.5 
percent would want to sacrifice their standard of living. Most 
Czechs feel they "cannot do much for the environment." 
  In the same poll, when asked to name the most important 
thing, almost half respondents replied that it was "keeping 
order in the country" (47.5 percent). 
  The next most important issues for the citizens of the Czech 
Republic were "having a greater say in the decisions of the 
government" (17.9 percent), protection of the freedom of speech 
(17.8 percent), and stopping price rises (15.2 percent). 
  The poll included a question on territorial arrangement and 
local government reform. Some 56.1 percent of respondents said 
the solution to the problem was important to them, while 43.9 
percent said it was not. Twice as many people intending to vote 
in the forthcoming local elections found the issue important 
than those not intending to vote. 
  STEM, the Center for Empirical Research, conducted the poll 
in the last week of November among 972 respondents. 
  People's views on the quality of health care in the first 
year of the independent Czech Republic were the subject of 
another STEM poll whose results were released today. 
  Thirty-three percent believe health care has improved, 
whereas 22 percent think it has worsened. 
  The biggest problem is felt to be under-funding, while the 
choice of doctors and the behavior of health care staff towards 
patients were rated the most positively. 
  Only 40 percent of those asked regarded themselves as 
healthy, the others citing minor or major complaints. However, 
58 percent felt they were healthier than most of their peers. 
  The poll also revealed that almost half Czechs use the 
services of private practices. 
  STEM asked 1,400 people in the first week of December.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on environmental issues monitored by Paraguay Bureau 
from 14 to 22 December. 
<H5>  ARGENTINA </H5>
  Congress on 15 December ratified the agreement on biological 
diversity signed in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992. The 
agreement's objective is to preserve biological diversity, tap 
natural resources in a sustainable way, and fairly share in the 
benefits derived from such exploitation. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS 
ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1644 GMT 19 Dec 93) 
<H5>  BOLIVIA </H5>
  Lumber companies oppose two aspects of the bill on forest 
exploitation being debated in Congress: the taxes, which they 
deem too high and the number of years covered by each permit for 
logging. The companies want the government to give them these 
areas. Bolivian environmental organizations are against that 
because they believe it would be like privatizing the national 
forests. The sustained development minister, however, believes 
it is logical and acceptable that businesses want to own the 
logging areas. He added that, otherwise, businesses would not be 
motivated to spend on projects for sustained management of the 
forests. The bill includes permits for 40 years of exploitation, 
but the government wants the bill to consider giving away the 
areas to be exploited. (La Paz Television Nacional Network in 
Spanish 0100 GMT 16 Dec 93) 
<H5>  BRAZIL </H5>
  The Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources, IBAMA, and Salvador prefecture have signed an 
agreement for opening a new egg-laying area for sea turtles, 
which will be located at the Itapua ecological camping area. The 
area will be fitted with two tanks for the preservation of some 
species. (Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network in Portuguese 2100 GMT 
17 Dec 93) 
  The National Environment Council on 17 December authorized 
IBAMA to grant Petrobras, Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, a 
license to drill and operate an oil well in the Piacabucu 
environmental preservation area in Alagoas. (Brasilia Voz do 
Brasil Network in Portuguese 2100 GMT 17 Dec 93) 
  President Itamar Franco has signed an agreement to clean up 
the Paraiba do Sul River basin. France will cooperate in this 
project that will cost more than $3 billion. This river crosses 
through 78 towns in Minas Gerais, 41 in Rio de Janeiro, and 37 
in Sao Paulo, supplying more than 12 million people with water, 
in addition to generating electricity through the Santa Barbara, 
Jaguari, and Funil dams. This project is expected to last 17 
years. Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero said the technology 
to be used will be the same as in the Rio Doce Valley basin in 
Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, and that it will count on the 
technical cooperation of the French Government. (Brasilia Voz do 
Brasil Network in Portuguese 2100 GMT 22 Dec 93) 
  Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul State signed a cooperation 
agreement on sanitation in the Porto Alegre border area on 21 
December. The agreement contemplates the implementation of 
several joint projects such as maintenance work, the enhancement 
of water quality, and technological research. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 1628 GMT 21 Dec 93) 
<H5>  CHILE </H5>
  The Chilean Government on 13 December established an 
Environmental Fund and the Administrative Council for the 
Americas that seeks to "promote activities geared to preserving, 
protecting, or administering Chile's natural and biological 
resources in an environmentally sound and sustainable way, as 
well as promoting the enhancement of the survival and 
development of Chile's infant population." The financial 
resources for this fund, which amount to $20 million, come from 
interest on Chile's outstanding debt with the United States, 
which has been canceled by the U.S. Government. This council 
will be made up of 11 members: one U.S. Government 
representative, four Chilean Government representatives, and six 
Chilean nongovernmental organization representatives. (Santiago 
EL MERCURIO in Spanish 14 Dec 93 Economic and Business Section 
page B2) 
  The environmental organization "Defenders of the Chilean 
Forest" has reported that more than 100,000 hectares of native 
forests have been destroyed in the last few years. According to 
official data, native forests cover 11 million hectares, 11,000 
hectares of which are depleted every year for the production of 
wood chips, the raw material for computer paper. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 1630 GMT 20 Dec 93)

  [Text] Oruro, 30 Oct--Yesterday marked the start of the 
first phase of the environmental measurement plan to determine 
the level of Vinto Metallurgical Enterprise's pollution. It will 
involve taking air, water, and soil samples on a 500-meter 
radius around the national smelting enterprise. 
  This work has been designed for the first phase of the 
environmental control program, with backing from the German 
Government, whose investment will amount to 10 million German 
marks (approximately $7.5 million), to be completed by fiscal 
year 1994. 
  The environmental control plan will make it possible to 
learn 
the real pollution levels, and will serve as a basic factor for 
future environmental control regulations on the national level, 
according to Rene Candia Trigo, general manager of the smelting 
complex. 
  He explained that the results of the study being made will 
soon afford the opportunity to achieve regulations for 
environmental control based on a detailed analysis, and taking 
all the studies conducted thus far into account. 
  He claimed that the environmental control program is the 
metallurgical enterprise's top priority, noting that they are 
waiting to hear the first results of the evaluation, so as to 
continue with that program. He maintained that the latter would 
make it possible to guarantee a production "without pollution, 
while protecting the population's health." 
  He added that this work was begun based on the commitment 
assumed by the mining secretary, Jaime Villalobos, to deal with 
the region's problem and to provide an opportunity for making 
environmental audits in the area of environmental pollution, 
using Oruro as a pilot city.

  [Text] Oruro, 20 Nov--The Oruro Regional Development 
Corporation (CORDEOR) is striving to achieve the rehabilitation 
of Lakes Poopo and Uru Uru, to ensure the survival of the Uru 
Muratos, settlers belonging to an indigenous tribe living on the 
shores of those lakes. 
  The current contamination and salinity of Lake Poopo's 
waters 
is threatening extinction for the region's flora and fauna. This 
has evoked concern among the indigenous settlers, who are 
suffering from a lack of food for their subsistence. 
  The CORDEOR president, Marcelo Arzabe Vasquez, explained to 
PRESENCIA that the rehabilitation of Lake Poopo and other nearby 
lakes is an imminent event. It is based on the plan being 
carried out with the Joint Bolivian-Peruvian Commission for the 
Development of the Lake Titicaca Integrated Zone (Subcomilagos), 
which includes the rehabilitation of the upper and lower basins 
of the Desaguadero River. 
  He remarked: "This plan has been handled with special 
dedication, because we are aware that we must guarantee the 
natural habitat for the lives of the indigenous tribes and 
nations, particularly the Uru Muratos who make their living from 
fishing and hunting on Lake Poopo. Their subsistence fishing is 
nonexistent, and this is a major concern of our administration." 
<H5>  Lack of Attention </H5>
  Daniel Moricio Choque, leader of the Uru Muratos, for his 
part, explained that they know that Lake Poopo's waters are 
contaminated, and yet this situation does not concern any 
authorities. He claimed this to be so despite the fact that the 
atherine [a mackerel species] fishing catch in 1992 did not 
exceed 500 kg, compared to 1990's total of 3,000 tons, and 
accounting for 50 percent of the national production. 
  During 1991, the atherine production amounted to 2,600 tons. 
In 1992, 90 percent of the fishing fauna disappeared, and in 
1993 there is nothing to fish for, as the indigenous leader 
explained. He said that this proved to be a difficult situation 
of those living in the Murato settlements. 
  The indigenous residents feed themselves with wild ducks 
from 
the area but, owing to the water's salinity, they too are 
becoming extinct. This prompts the prediction that there will 
soon be total famine. 
  Currently engaged in raising Aymara sheep, the Uru Muratos 
are hoping to obtain a small territory in which to devote 
themselves to farming. 
  The situation being experienced in the settlements of 
Punaca, 
Tinta Maria, Llapallapani, and Willaneque is tragic, because the 
inactivity caused by the reduction in Lake Poopo's water level 
and the lack of fish is causing massive migration. This has left 
the communities as ghost towns, and the schools that existed 
have been closed. They are waiting for attention from the 
national authorities to alleviate this situation, which is now 
added to the poverty and misery of those who have sustained the 
fishing activity for centuries. 
<H5>  Rehabilitation </H5>
  To achieve the rehabilitation of Lake Poopo, consideration 
was given to a study made in 1985, warning of the lake's 
contamination with heavy metals. The study, conducted by Great 
Britain's Overseas Development Administration (ODA), announced 
the results of the chemical and spectrophotometric analyses of 
samples of water, plants, sediments, and fish from the Poopo 
Basin. 
  The analyses have made it possible to establish the fact 
that 
this lake was highly saline (in 1985), particularly in the 
south, where the salinity exceeded 70 percent. These figures are 
higher than those recorded at Lake Moon, California, one of the 
best documented saline lakes. 
  The evidence from all the water, plant, silt, and fish 
samples indicates that there are extraordinarily high 
concentrations of all metals in the Poopo Basin. 
  According to the study, the concentration of dissolved 
metals 
in the lake comes from the largest deposits in central Bolivia, 
such as the Poopo, Monserrat, Avicaya, and Huanuni mines, 
located no farther than 20 km from the lake. 
  The strongest evidence of contamination comes from the San 
Juan Sora Sora River, containing high concentrations of a wide 
range of metals. It is known that the levels of many metals are 
toxic for fish, and levels exceeding those permitted have been 
recorded.

  [Text] Foz do Iguacu, Parana -- In the Upper Paraguay River 
(which includes the Mato Grosso marshlands) deforestation and 
mercury are destroying the local fauna and flora; in Rio Grande 
do Sul 4 million hectares are in the process of desertification; 
in the Pilcomayo Basin -- encompassing Bolivia, Argentina, and 
Paraguay -- the flow of 98 million metric tons of sediments a 
year causes silting and flooding. 
  Those are some of the most critical problems discussed by 
participants in the First International Symposium on River Plate 
Basin Environmental Problems, which gathered more than 100 
experts from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia 
in Foz do Iguacu during the last four days. 
  The meeting was sponsored by the Institudo Acqua and 
attended 
by French and U.S. experts as well as OAS and UNESCO 
representatives. 
  The River Plate Basin -- the third largest on the planet -- 
presents problems everywhere. The exploitation of natural 
resources without appropriate guidelines endangers unique 
ecosystems such as the Pantanal [Mato Grosso's marshlands], the 
Mata Atlantica [strip of forests along the Atlantic coast], and 
the Cerrado [central plateau region]. Besides all this, the 
River Plate basin is the only one whose rivers flow from a 
tropical to a temperate region. 
  In the River Plate Basin live 116 million Argentines, 
Brazilians, Paraguayans, Uruguayans, and Bolivians whose 
contribution to their country's GDP's is considerable. With the 
exception of Bolivia, in January 1995 the other four nations 
will begin a process aimed at integrating their economies 
through the Common Market of the South (Mercosur). Rivers will 
be used as large avenues. Their economic importance also can be 
measured by their energy-producing capacity: 42,000 megawatts. 
  Newton Cordeiro, coordinator for South America of the OAS' 
Regional Environment Department, said: "Changes provoked by 
agriculture and industry, the existence of numerous dams, and 
future transportation projects combined with the rain system and 
the soil quality create risks of flooding, mud slides, and 
prolonged droughts."

  [Text] Colombia will have an Environment Ministry. 
Congress has approved the law creating it. The law establishes 
incentives for those who replant forests and severe penalties 
for those who contribute toward contamination. High school 
graduates who are serving in the military may do so in 
environmental tasks. He who contaminates will pay. This is one 
of the main purposes of the Environmental Law, which will guard 
and conserve the country's natural resources from now on but 
with full collaboration from the community. 
  [Begin Aduardo Uribe, National Department of Planning 
Environmental director, recording] The bill creates several 
ways for community participation. It allows the people who live 
along rivers and in forests to speak up and participate in the 
decisions that will affect their environment. [end recording] 
  Each municipality will design its own environmental 
conservation plans. They will receive special support from the 
police, and the attorney general will delegate environmental 
matters. 
  [Begin Uribe recording] There are taxes, fines, and 
penalties established for destroying our natural resources. 
There are penalties that can be applied and executed by the 
public forces, municipal and regional authorities, and the 
Environment Ministry. According to the law, these entities now 
have police functions. [end recording] 
  The project takes off using a $25-million IDB loan followed 
by the government's contribution. A new aspect of the law is 
that 20 percent of young enlisted men will be allowed to serve 
in ecological tasks. There are also awards for those who 
restore the environment by planting all types of plants and 
introducing animal species. The government will absorb up to 75 
percent of any restoration efforts.

  Speaking to the state news agency, JAMPRESS, Douglas said 
the 
move is to protect the island's delicate ecology, regarded as "a 
national asset." The environment minister said his government 
also intended to institute a licence, which would be necessary 
for any type of significant development, industrial or 
otherwise, of interest to the environment. 
  The Natural Resources Conservation Development Authority 
(NRCA) would be the body responsible for granting such licences, 
Douglas said. And there would be close collaboration with the 
Town and Country Planning Department to avoid duplication and to 
better co- ordinate and speed up the process, he added. 
  Douglas repeated previous announcements that steps were 
being 
taken to have the Cockpit Country and the Black River area 
designated as national parks. He observed that action would soon 
be taken to clean up the Kingston Harbour which was badly 
polluted in some parts. The main contaminants are sewage and 
chemical residue from the 21 gullies and mains which emptied 
their contents into it. The environment minister also said the 
city's sewerage system is to be upgraded.

  [Text] Mexico City, 27 Dec (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico today 
promulgated the Border Ecological Cooperation Commission 
[Comision de Cooperation Ecologica Fronteriza] and the North 
American Development Bank [Banco de Desarrollo de America del 
Norte] that will start operating on 1 January 1994 with the 
implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
[NAFTA]. 
  The decree promulgating the agreement between the two 
countries established that the goal of the commission and the 
bank is to support the protection and upgrading of the 
environment at the U.S.- Mexican border. 
  The agreement creating the two institutions was approved by 
the Chamber of Senators on 16 December and was promulgated today 
through its publication in the federation's official newspaper. 
The text of the agreement underscores the importance of 
preserving, protecting, and improving the environment for the 
sake of present-day and future generations and the urgency of 
addressing ecological problems at the U.S.-Mexican border. The 
United States and Mexico agreed to create the commission and the 
bank within the framework of NAFTA, which includes Canada. The 
U.S. Government promulgated NAFTA on 8 December. 
  The agreement underscores the need to establish an 
ecological 
infrastructure at the border, especially in contaminated areas, 
as well as the need to treat sewage water and solid waste, among 
others. The agreement states that the commission's goal is to 
support the preservation, protection, and improvement of ecology 
at the border area to increase the well-being of the people of 
Mexico and the United States. The commission will also 
cooperate, as required, with the North American Development 
Bank, other national and international institutions, and sources 
of private investment capital in the development of ecological 
infrastructure projects in the area. 
  The commission will participate in the drafting, 
development, 
implementation, and supervision of those projects and will 
analyze the financial or environmental feasibility of such 
plans, and will evaluate the economic and social benefits of 
ecological infrastructure projects in the area. 
  The commission will have a directorate, two managers, that 
is, a general manager and a deputy general manager, an advisory 
council, as well as the officials and personnel it requires to 
carry out its duties. It will also have legal status and full 
power to sign contracts, purchase and transfer personal property 
and real estate, and start legal procedures. 
  The commission will issue a yearly report on its operations 
in Spanish and English that will be drafted by the general 
manager and approved by the directorate. Copies of the report 
will be available to the people of the two countries. The 
commission will be in operation until one of the parties decides 
to withdraw, and this party is able to do so six months after 
filing a written request. 
  The North American Development Bank will finance projects 
certified by and at the request of the commission and will be 
assisted by the commission in the achievement of its goals and 
fulfillment of its duties. In carrying out its duties the bank 
will use its own capital, funds obtained in financial markets 
and other available resources, and will promote the investment 
of public and private capital in companies and activities with 
ecological purposes. 
  The agreement states that the bank will have initial capital 
of $3 billion divided into 300,000 shares, each one with a 
nominal value of $10,000, and they will be at the disposal of 
the parties. Of that total, there will be $450 million in 
paid-up shares [liberadas] and $2.550 billion in not fully 
paid-up shares [pagaderas]. The agreement states that Mexico 
and the United States each will own [suscribiran] 22,500 paid-up 
shares and 127,500 not fully paid-up shares for a total of 
150,000 shares each and a grand total of 300,000 shares between 
the two.

<F P=106> [Report by Rosita Caldera] </F>
  [Text] The executive branch is scheduled to issue a formal 
letter of protest to the United States as its first response to 
the U.S. EPA's new marketing guidelines for unleaded 
[reformulada] gasoline. President Ramon J. Velasquez announced 
the government's decision in exclusive statements to EL 
UNIVERSAL. Velasquez said the country will certainly feel the 
impact of the U.S. move, which is why Venezuela will undertake 
"every appropriate measure to correct this situation." 
  President Velasquez received a report from Simon Consalvi, 
the Venezuelan ambassador in Washington, informing him of the 
new gasoline guidelines in the United States. When the 
guidelines go into effect in January 1995, the measure will 
force Venezuela to stop selling some 50,000 barrels of oil a day 
to the United States. According the president, such a loss 
undoubtedly will adversely affect the country's financial 
situation. The decision forces us to begin actions to prevent 
the implementation of this measure. It contradicts the United 
States' proclaimed policy of free trade and economic 
integration. With this measure, Venezuela feels its economic 
interests have been damaged. Moreover, this policy contradicts 
Article 3 of GATT. For this reason, Venezuela, as a GATT 
member, should denounce before GATT this unfair trade policy 
affecting our exports. 
  The official statement the government will issue today will 
be drafted in almost the exact terms used by President Velasquez 
in making his statements to EL UNIVERSAL. The government will 
insist the U.S. measure is at odds with Venezuela's rightful 
desire to maintain its current export levels. Moreover, we have 
a year -- from now until January 1995 -- to continue pressing 
our just demands, the president added.

  [Text] Maracaibo -- The Venezuelan and Colombian 
Governments have started to implement an agreement signed in 
Washington by the ambassadors of the two neighboring countries 
which calls for the preservation of the Catatumbo Hydrographic 
Basin. 
  At a binational meeting held recently in Cucuta the parties 
agreed to establish, after 17 years of talks, a technical 
committee to exploit and preserve the basin of the Catatumbo 
River, which "has been damaged by irrational exploitation by the 
two countries of their respective upper basins," said Omar 
Baralt, president of the Venezuelan Presidential Commission on 
Border Affairs. 
  Baralt said that the Catatumbo River, with its headwaters in 
Colombia and its drainage into the sea in Venezuela, is an 
ecosystem that supplies 60 percent of the fresh water that flows 
into Lake Maracaibo. "We have high stakes in this," he warned. 
  Colombia rejected in the beginning any understanding 
claiming 
principles of sovereignty, because it argued that Venezuela was 
merely offering it participation in the preservation of that 
basin. 
  Baralt added that "in view that no agreement was reached 
then, we insisted over the past 17 years and managed to reach an 
agreement with OAS assistance to settle sovereignty problems 
between the two nations." 
  This agreement states that the two nations, through the OAS, 
will preserve the basin by implementing a medium-run 
comprehensive plan. 
  Omar Baralt added that in that zone "not only the basin is 
being destroyed but there is heavy contamination of the river, 
because the Departments of Santander and Norte de Santander, 
which contain 85 percent of the population estimated at between 
6 and 8 million inhabitants, are along the Catatumbo River." 
  The president of the commission on border affairs also 
voiced 
his concern over the exploitation of coal, which is highly 
contaminating, which was detected in the Catatumbo Basin.

<F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Dec 7 (AFP)--Arab states, which control 
60 percent of global oil reserves, are proposing a worldwide tax 
that could raise more than four billion dollars a year to 
protect the environment. 
  The idea is seen as a "fair" alternative to a proposed 
European Community energy tax, which has caused alarm in 
oil-producing states on the grounds it would slow down demand 
for crude and depress their earnings. 
  "There are several more effective and fair alternatives to 
the taxes on oil products," Arab states said in their 1993 joint 
economic report, prepared by the Organisation of Arab Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OAPEC) and two other regional organisations. 
  "The first is the imposition of a worldwide income tax of 
0.25 percent, which could fetch around four billion dollars a 
year in the industrial countries and 750 million dollars in 
developing nations." 
  "The sum could be used to clean and protect the 
environment." 
  It is the latest in a series of Arab proposals to persuade 
the 12-nation E.C. to steer away from its planned tax, which the 
community says is designed to protect the environment by 
containing the emission of carbon dioxide. 
  But Arab and other oil producers charge the E.C.'s real aim 
is to secure extra revenue to tackle domestic budget deficits. 
  Reservations from Britain and other E.C. nations have held 
up 
enforcement of the tax, which will levy three dollars on every 
imported barrel of oil, to rise to 10 dollars by the year 2000. 
  "Imposing taxes on oil products will not protect the 
environment nor will it curb crude imports," said the Arab 
report, part of which was carried by the official Kuwaiti news 
agency KUNA. 
  "They will only achieve large increases in government 
revenues in industrial countries at the expense of oil 
producers." 
  Gulf Arab states have strongly attacked the tax on the 
grounds it would affect them most as oil accounts for nearly 90 
percent of their income. 
  Around four million barrels per day (b/d) of their oil 
output 
goes to the E.C., while 2.8 million b/d are exported to Japan 
and two million b/d to the United States. 
  One of the scenarios on the effects of the carbon tax on 
Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC) states is that it will depress their 
earnings by 14 billion dollars a year, hurting their development 
plans. 
  The revenues of GCC states--Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates--are already under 
pressure from a sharp decline in oil prices. 
  Since 1981, their earnings have been slashed nearly 
threefold 
to 70 billion dollars in 1992. 
  "Definitely, Arab oil and gas exports will be hurt by the 
policies of the industrial nations," said the Arab report, also 
prepared by the Arab Monetary Fund and the Arab Fund for 
Economic and Social Development. 
  "Imposing taxes on oil products will also boost consumption 
of coal and burning of wood, which will cause further damage to 
the environment." 
  It said Arab oil exports stood at 38.3 percent of the total 
world crude exports of 39.7 million b/d in 1992, while natural 
gas exports accounted for 12.1 percent of the total world gas 
supplies.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 15 Dec (MENA)--A working group formed by 
the Middle East Multilateral Talks Economic Development 
Committee ended its meetings in Cairo today. It approved 
several projects that will be implemented in cooperation with 
the EC and Middle Eastern countries. 
  The Cairo meeting is the first of several planned by the 
Economic Development Committee during its meeting in Copenhagen 
on 8 and 9 November. A program called the Copenhagen Work 
Program was drawn up then. 
  The agreement reached today provides for four agricultural 
projects to be implemented with the cooperation of Egypt, the 
occupied territories, Israel, and Jordan. Agreement was also 
reached to implement a project involving cleaning up pollution 
in the Gulf of Aqaba and preserving marine life and coral. This 
project will be carried out with the help of the gulf's littoral 
countries. Agreement was also reached to carry out a joint 
tourism project involving Egypt, Israel, and the occupied 
territories. 
  Dr 'Adil al-Biltaji, chairman of the board of directors of 
the Egyptian Agricultural Research Center and Egypt's 
representative at the meeting, told MENA that agreement was 
reached to establish four networks through which expertise and 
data will be exchanged with the aim of promoting research in 
various spheres. 
  Dr. al-Biltaji explained that the first sphere is connected 
with natural resources, notably desert plants, and ways of 
protecting them. He said each regional country will make 
efforts in one particular sphere and all the resulting 
information on available natural resources will be exchanged and 
coordinated. He said this project will be carried out through 
the joint efforts of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey and in 
coordination with Italy. He added that the EC will provide 
financial backing for this $125-million project. 
  Dr. al-Biltaji said the second project is connected with the 
effects insecticides have on the soil. The aim is to minimize 
the use of insecticides and prevent harm to people, plants, and 
natural resources like water. [passage omitted]

  [Text] New Delhi, Nov 15: India is to get Rs 6,000 crores 
from the global fund dedicated to the Montreal Protocol to help 
implement a plan to phaseout the use of chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) and other ozone destroying chemicals. 
  The country programme prepared by India, with the help of 
UNDP and the cooperation of Indian industry, was recently 
approved by the executive committee on country programmes under 
the Montreal Protocol. Under the Protocol, the entire 
incremental cost of the phaseout in India, whose annual 
consumption of the environmentally damaging chemicals is less 
than 0.3 kg per capita, is to be met by the global fund. The Rs. 
6,000 crores approved is the first part of the payment. 
  India is unique among developing countries as it is 
self-sufficient in the production of chlorofluorocarbons and is 
expected to soon produce halons in sufficient quantities to meet 
the domestic demand. In 1991 the total consumption of the 
harmful chemicals in India was about 10,000 tonnes. By the year 
2010, the demand and consumption is expected to rise to 1,84,000 
tonnes. A large part of the increase is expected in the 
airconditioning and refrigeration industries.

  [Text] New Delhi, Nov 17 (PTI): India has urged the bureau 
of parties to the Montreal protocol that the CFC producing 
developing countries should also be allowed to export CFCs to 
the consumer countries during the phase-out period of Ozone 
depleting substances (ODS). 
  Under the protocol provisions, only the developed countries 
are allowed to export CFCs. India, China and Brazil are among 
the developing countries which are in a position to export CFCs. 
  Delivering his presidential address at the concluding 
session 
of the fifth meeting of the bureau of the parties to the 
Montreal protocol in Bangkok today, the minister of environment 
and forests, Mr Kamal Nath, said that this would help reduce the 
burden on the developing countries as well as on the 
multilateral fund. 
  This would also help accelerating the process of phasing out 
of the ozone depleting substances. 
  Mr Kamal Nath lays down his office as chairman of the bureau 
at the end of his one-year term today. 
  Mr Kamal Nath said that the provisions of the protocol 
should 
be so amended that the early reduction of ODS did not become a 
disincentive. In fact, such efforts needed to be recognised and 
rewarded, rather than be allowed to become a punitive constraint 
in future. 
  Expressing deep concern over the development of technology 
and its transfer, the minister suggested that the effort should 
be widened by roping into the process more scientific and 
technical institutions, particularly in the countries where the 
appropriate technologies were to be used. 
  He pointed out that the denial of funds for research and 
technology development would amount to the protection of 
commercial interests of a few and not the environmental 
interests of all. 
  Stressing the need of rigorous control over the demonstrable 
essential uses of halons, Mr Kamal Nath said that it must be 
borne in mind that many developing countries did not have access 
to the halon substitutes available to the developed countries. 
  These realities must all receive due consideration, 
including 
when deciding upon the location of halon banks. The 
halon-producing developing countries should be involved in the 
development of halon banks, he said. 
  Mr Kamal Nath cautioned that with the greater integration of 
the global economy and the on-going liberalisation process in 
several parts of the world, it should be ensured that ODS-using 
equipment that would become technologically obsolete, or the use 
of which was legally restricted, in the developed world was not 
dumped by unscrupulous elements onto projects in developing 
countries. 
  Each country would have to evolve suitable mechanisms to 
ensure this. But simultaneously, while approving projects, the 
executive committee would also have to ensure that ODS-using 
equipment was suitably prevented from recirculation, he said. 
  Reviewing with satisfaction the last one year's progress 
under his chairmanship, Mr Kamal Nath said a total of 122 
countries had signed the protocol. 
  The executive committee has so far approved 27 country 
programmes for phasing out ODS and sanctioned projects and 
activities worth a total of $200 million. India's country 
programme worth $2 billion was approved by the committee last 
week in Bangkok. 
  The minister stressed the need for adequate and timely 
replenishment of the multilateral fund and requested that 
contributions to the full extent of the agreed target amount be 
made with a sense of urgency.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Vasilenko, chief of the council of experts </F>
for issues of social ecology, the Nevada-Semipalatinsk 
International Antinuclear Movement, in the "Opinion" column: 
"Atom in Our House. The Ecological Status of Test Sites and the 
Nuclear Industry"] 
  [Text] ...Still new instances of dangerous pollution of 
territories are being revealed, whereas the elimination of the 
risk zones is proceeding slowly because old "debtors" are in no 
hurry to assume responsibility for their mistakes before the 
people. Moreover, even the relapses and stereotypes of a 
militarist ideology survive. 
  The public has become aware of draft agreements between the 
Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan concerning 
procedures for the use of test sites and joint activities for 
the conversion and subsequent use of the facilities of the 
former Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. An analysis of the draft 
agreements indicates that no review of the documents by 
ecological-law experts has been administered, i.e. the 
conformity of the documents to the principles, norms, and 
articles of the laws of the Russian Federation and the Republic 
of Kazakhstan concerning environmental protection has not been 
evaluated. 
  We cannot fail to take into account the fact that, from the 
ecological point of view, military test sites form a specific 
and specialized type of use of natural resources within the 
Earth's biosphere whereby the means of the forcible conduct of 
politics, armaments, and all technologies (nuclear, chemical, 
physical, mechanical, bacteriological, climatic, and possibly 
others) are used to destroy natural components and eliminate 
live species and people within their active zone, which means 
are extremely dangerous for humanity. 
  Following Rio-92, which adopted new principles of ecological 
security, all countries of the world should revise the 
principles of their international relations, all the more so 
because the problem of the survival of civilization has become 
an absolute priority from the point of view of the global 
problems of humanity, of which the ecological problem is one. 
  The ideology for the joint use of territories (ecosystems) 
for test sites should be ecological rather than military 
(militarist). The peculiarities and specialization of each test 
site should be clearly specified, set forth, and mapped out in 
terms of all characteristics and parameters. The special 
ecological status of this type and form of the use of natural 
resources shall be based on a strict regulatory ecological 
framework, ecological and legal control norms, and instruments 
firmly restricting possible and permissible military and other 
destruction so as to preserve nature and to not damage the 
ecological systems of the Earth's biosphere and man on a local 
scale, to say nothing of global. 
  Kazakhstan has already paid too dearly for the militarist 
ambitions of the totalitarian system, and it is still paying. 
This will be a forced payment until such time as Kazakhstan and 
the Russian Federation implement an ecological conversion of the 
nuclear power industry and the nuclear industry in general, 
including such facilities as the Semipalatinsk nuclear test 
site. Kazakhstan in whose lands a war has never originated could 
become an international center for the ecologically safe 
(natural) development of nuclear technologies, at any rate for 
the period in which the raw materials accumulated in the course 
of the nuclear race are used by nuclear power stations. 
Therefore, for this idea to be implemented, all test sites in 
Kazakhstan and Russia should be transparent to the public, 
independent expert review. This is why the agreements should 
provide for ecological observers. This will facilitate the 
demilitarization of the consciousness of the politicians, the 
military, and the public alike and the overall ecological 
friendliness of the use of national resources. In general, 
military test sites should have the necessary engineering and 
ecological equipment and instruments for all types and forms of 
the evaluation of the impact of explosions and all technologies 
on the biospheric environment, ecosystems, and man within them. 
In this sense, former military test sites should functionally 
become ecological test sites. 
  In conjunction with this, the issue of the ecological status 
of the Semipalatinsk test site (SIP) acquires particular social, 
political, and legal significance. With the issue of the SIP 
raised in this manner, we should be discussing joint activities 
in the ecological retrofitting and ecological conversion of the 
SIP facilities rather than their transformation. This is also a 
fundamental issue because the forms and methods of eliminating 
the consequences of explosions, prospects, priorities, and 
directions for the development of nuclear power generation and 
the nuclear industry in general hinge on it. 
  Taking into account the above arguments, we believe that it 
is legally justified to raise the issue of openly carrying out 
an independent, public ecological expert review and public 
control in the area of environmental protection under the aegis 
of the Nevada-Semipalatinsk International Antinuclear Movement, 
its committee on issues and expert councils of scientists. 
Articles 40, 42, 48, 49, 55, 59, 61, and 62 of the Law of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan on the Protection of the Natural 
Environment give us this right, and we are informing the 
population about this. 
  As we see it, all the enumerated problems compel us to make 
fundamental revisions in general in the "Management and Planning 
Chart for Conducting Research and Testing by the Ecology and 
Emergency Scientific-Research Complex," which does not even make 
a reference to either the Ministry of Ecology and Biological 
Resources or the International Antinuclear Movement. 
  We propose a different version of the management chart 
which, 
in addition to taking into account the place and role of the 
Ministry of Ecology and Biological Resources, the 
Nevada-Semipalatinsk International Antinuclear Movement, should 
provide for subdivisions to not just control ecological 
consequences but to provide ecological services to the test site 
and its zone of impact in general. 
  In view of the "contribution" of nuclear energy to the grave 
ecological situation in Kazakhstan, we consider the issue of 
setting forth the ecological status of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan National Nuclear Center as an institute and sector 
for special use of natural resources to be topical. In the legal 
and political aspect, this issue is topical for the corporation 
of the nuclear power industry and the nuclear agency because it 
is associated with the issue of developing the concept of 
nuclear law as law on the specific use of natural resources by 
the sector. 
  This issue is politically and legally topical for Kazakhstan 
and CIS countries in general because no effective special 
institutions have been created in them to defend the ecological 
rights of the population in the zones of extreme impact of 
technical origin and even in the already announced disaster 
zones. As a result, for example, ecological rights of the 
citizens of Kazakhstan proclaimed in Article 7 of the Law on the 
Protection of the Natural Environment are not actually defended 
by anyone, and are violated right and left. In the sector and at 
the enterprises of nuclear power generation and in the nuclear 
industry this violation is currently expressed in the extremely 
slow elimination of radioactive contamination and the 
consequences of pollution and radioactive exposure of the 
population; control over the use safety is lacking at the 
locations of mining, processing, and even transportation and 
burial of waste. 
  At present, the ecological situation in the republic and the 
sector is such that, in our view, it is necessary to develop and 
pass a law on the liquidation of the consequences of nuclear 
explosions (military and regular industrial) carried out in 
Kazakhstan, socioecological rehabilitation of the population and 
disaster territories, zones, and regions, ecological conversion 
of defense installations, and ecological retrofitting of the 
nuclear industry. This law should provide for a comprehensive 
ecological regimentation of all work in the sector and the 
development of nuclear power generation and the nuclear industry 
in general; from the socioecological point of view, they have 
been developing by the trial and error method to this day. The 
first legal act of ecological law has been passed (for now, only 
with regard to sufferers in the Aral Sea area). However, this is 
merely the beginning of a gigantic effort to solve the most 
complex problems of social ecology.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuleshov: "The Aral's Fate for the </F>
Caspian?"] 
  [Text] Ashgabat--O. Ovezgeldyyev, the author of the 
concept of a long-term program of research into the problems of 
the Caspian and well-known Turkmen academician, declares: 
"Unless an international center coordinating the actions of the 
Caspian countries to save the Caspian is formed in the very near 
future and unless these countries pool their scientific, 
economic, and legal forces to this end, we will simply lose it, 
like we lost the Aral." 
  Having become a sump of industrial enterprises' toxic waste, 
the Caspian is today essentially suffocating from phenols, 
acids, alkalis, and organic substances. Scientists believe the 
overall volume of harmful effluent long since exceeded the 
annual flow of such rivers as the Ural, Terek, Kura, and Samur 
put together. 
  Added to the grim ecological situation is concern that the 
constant rise in the sea level since 1978 continues. In the 
current situation immediate coordinated actions of the five 
states with an outlet to hoary Khazar--Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, 
Russia, Azerbaijan, and Iran--are required. 
  We had become so accustomed to and comfortable with the 
practice of the wasteful use of natural resources that in 
unthinkingly and unhesitatingly having closed off by a sealed 
dike the Kara-Bogaz Bay and having thereby interrupted the 
natural process of accumulation of hydro-mineral raw material in 
the bay it did not even occur to us that we were thereby ruining 
a renewable source, most unique on a world scale, of chemical 
resources. With the closing off of the bay the natural balance 
in the region was disturbed for it was not just something but 
Kara-Bogaz-Gol, as the thermal regulator of the Caspian, which 
mainly stabilized the level of the sea. 
  "Had Turkmenistan been able to comprehensively assimilate 
the 
unlost Kara-Bogaz-Gol," Academician O. Ovezgeldyyev says, "this 
would have been sufficient for putting together a fully balanced 
state budget. And no oil or gas would have been needed here 
since types of raw material that are much more efficient than 
hydrocarbons could have been recovered from the bay. Look, the 
Japanese are spending immense resources to recover minerals from 
the ocean. We in Kara-Bogaz-Gol, on the other hand, could get 
them practically free of charge...." 
  Another well known scientist, A. Khodzhamamedov, president 
of 
the Academy of Sciences of Turkmenistan and head of the 
Institute of Chemistry of the republic's Academy of Sciences, is 
insistently recommending to the leadership of his country today 
that the Caspian be plugged into the economic and mineral-raw 
material base of Turkmenistan. But he warns here that it will be 
very, very dangerous if each Caspian country begins to view the 
Caspian and its possibilities individually, without coordinated 
actions. The predatory catch of fish, the barbaric production of 
oil on the shelves, and the nonstop discharge of industrial 
effluent into the rivers feeding Khazar, as the Caspian was 
called in ancient times, would begin in this case. Agreed 
ecological norms and an international center for study of the 
problems of the Caspian are needed to prevent this. 
  There is, strictly speaking, none of this as yet. No Caspian 
state has yet embarked in earnest on a monitoring of the level 
of the sea or a geological inspection of its depths, not to 
mention the elaboration of scientifically substantiated 
ecological norms.

<F P=106> [Article signed J.-P.D.: "Sixteen Research Projects In </F>
Cooperation With the European Union"] 
  [Text] Many companies are already cooperating with the 
authorities in the Chernobyl region. A research center -- the 
CHERCIR [Chernobyl Center for International Research] -- has 
opened at the site under the aegis of the IAEA [International 
Atomic Energy Agency]. The European Union, which has been 
working there since 1990, decided to go further and in June 1992 
signed an accord with Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. 
  Since 1991, Europe has invested a total of ECU14.2 million 
(Fr95 million) in order to finance 16 research projects. A 
laboratory is currently being set up in the exclusion zone and 
an office and housing facilities are available to researchers at 
Zeleny Mys, on the edge of the zone. Together with health 
problems, much of the work is devoted to mapping out the 
contaminated areas, modeling the transfer of radioactive 
nuclides from the soil to plant life and then to animals and 
man, the study of their migration in the soil and the water 
systems, decontamination tests, etc. The researchers certainly 
have their work cut out. At the time of the accident, the 
"liquidators" had other concerns than the long- term protection 
of the environment. Reactor waste, the earth removed from the 
most contaminated areas, and the trees from the "red forest" 
burned by radiation were all buried, high and low radioactive 
waste all mixed in together. A total of 24 sites with 840 pits 
or trenches containing waste have been identified in the 
exclusion zone (10 km around the nuclear plant), explains Boris 
Prister, first deputy to the Ukrainian minister responsible for 
Chernobyl: "Studies are being carried out to determine if this 
waste must be treated separately from or included in the new 
entombment project." 
  In the meantime, readings have already shown a certain 
plutonium contamination (37 becquerels per liter) of the water 
circulating beneath the "red forest" burial sites. The ditches 
in this area which contain the waste have, however, been lined 
with clay -- unlike those at other sites. "I do not believe 
that there is an immediate danger, but serious problems could 
arise within 10 to 15 years," believes Jaak Sinnaeve, head of 
the "Research Actions for Radiological Protection" unit at the 
European Commission. "In any event," he adds, "there is an 
urgent need for a thorough inventory." For the moment, the river 
Pripyat, which flows into the Dnieper and which could therefore 
contaminate the Kiev basin, is protected by a "geotechnical 
barrier" (waterproof underground wall) some 2.1 kilometers long. 
But that is no more than a temporary measure. 
  "In the short term, it is the strontium 90 which is causing 
us the most concern, because it is soluble and thus migrates 
much more easily than cesium which is insoluble," explains Boris 
Prister. "After every period of heavy rainfall, we see major 
increases in the strontium concentration in the river." This is 
all the more worrying as the sandy soil favors the migration of 
radioactive nuclides, adds Nikolay Arkhipov, an expert in 
nuclear contamination who has been working at Chernobyl since 
May 1986, after having spent nearly 30 years studying the 
effects of the Kyshtym nuclear catastrophe in the Ural Mountains. 
  "We want to pursue genuine cooperative research," explains 
Lucien Cecille, project coordinator for Europe. "There is an 
enormous amount which our radiation protection researchers can 
learn. They could come here for several months each year. One 
day, we also hope to extend this network of laboratories to 
include the Kyshtym site." Rather an ambitious objective, 
perhaps. Although professing a commitment to cooperation, the 
project leaders from the three countries do not always show 
great enthusiasm for cooperating in the field. The 
Ukraine-Belarus border, which is to the north of the 30 km 
exclusion zone around Chernobyl, sometimes seems impenetrable 
for men and information.

<F P=106> ["Abridged" interview with V.I. Danilov-Danilyan, minister </F>
of environmental protection and natural resources, by 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent D. Frolov under the rubric 
"Opinion. ZELENYY MIR Files"; place and date not given: "Russia 
in an Ecological Zugzwang"] 
  [Text] Minister V.I. Danilov-Danilyan told 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent D. Frolov: "We and the West 
alike need Western aid." 
  Danilov-Danilyan: ...Dozens of cities in Russia 
have absolutely impermissible indicators of air pollution. If we 
omit the word "absolutely," the number of such cities will 
come...to 110. These are not some kind of provincial towns but 
rather large industrial and administrative centers, including 
the capital city. In many places, pollutants are superimposed 
over one another in a way: transportation generates nitrogen 
oxide and carbon monoxide, the iron and steel industry generates 
sulfur dioxide and benzopyrene; the chemical industry generates 
formaldehyde, phenol, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The cumulative 
effect of this cocktail is menacing, and the residents of cities 
such as Kemerovo, Nizhniy Tagil, Sverdlovsk, Perm, Chelyabinsk, 
and Saratov suffer incredibly because of this. 
  Most bodies of water are in an impermissible condition. The 
Volga is no longer a great Russian river but, by analogy with 
the Danube, which is called "Europe's cesspool," it fully merits 
the name of "Russia's cesspool." The Ladoga, Omega, Neva, North 
Dvina, and virtually all rivers of the Urals are polluted.... 
The Bering and Kara Seas have become a cemetery for 
decommissioned nuclear reactors; a favorable situation in regard 
to radiation is out of the question there. In general, 
radioactive contamination is our worst ecological problem: There 
are Chernobyl, Kyshtym, and dozens of oblasts with poorly 
controlled storage facilities. 
  Frolov: It would appear that the list of our 
ecological troubles could go on forever. As you see it, what 
kind of resources will be needed in order to contain, if not 
eliminate all of this? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: If monetary terms are at issue, 
it is very hard to make this assessment. For example, how can we 
appraise the extinction of a biological species or the damage 
done to a genetic pool? Of course, it is possible to count the 
dead forests, sick leave, and losses caused by the corrosion of 
metal. However, the result will be far from the truth. 
  As far as containment is concerned, this is a major problem 
indeed, because we are increasingly posing a danger to our 
neighbors. This is not necessarily a catastrophe on the scale of 
Chernobyl during which dozens of foreign radiation control 
stations recorded a leap in the radiation background. For 
example, our Pechenganikel and Severonikel combines are the main 
source of air pollution with sulfur dioxide in Scandinavia which 
affects Norway, Finland, and to a lesser degree Sweden. There is 
a draft to retrofit the combines by the Finnish company 
Outokumpo which will cost $640 million. Of this, Finland and 
Norway are prepared to pay $100 million and to extend credit for 
the rest which will be repaid with the products of the combine. 
Economic calculations have shown that the combine will not be 
recouped on such terms either. I raised the issue of looking for 
additional sources of financing with the ministers of ecology of 
these countries, and by all signs, they are prepared to do it. 
  Frolov: Therefore, previously it was customary to 
refer to international ecological cooperation, whereas at 
present it makes sense to talk about Western ecological aid. 
What could it be about? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: First of all, investment, 
technology, and know-how, and, to a lesser degree, consultation 
and training. Most unfortunately, everything happens the other 
way around. 
  At present, Russia lacks money rather than brains. Large 
investment into major transformations at a multitude of 
enterprises is needed to improve the situation because 
expenditures at the early stages of technological processes are 
the most effective. 
  It is necessary for ecological programs to cooperate with 
other commercial activities of foreign companies in our 
territory. We should grant all manner of preferences if they are 
prepared to finance such programs, and not at their own facility 
which is simply mandatory under the contracts, but in other 
areas not directly associated with the facility. 
  Not only we, but the West itself needs for us to receive 
Western aid. At present, they are discussing in earnest, and 
justifiably so, the prospects of global warming which does not 
promise humanity anything good. It develops because of the 
accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily 
carbonic acid which is generated in the process of combustion of 
energy resources. It turns out that it is profitable for all 
developed countries to invest funds in...planting forests in 
Russia rather than retrofitting their quite clean industry. 
Forests are a powerful drain on carbonic acid. One hectare will 
eliminate an amount of it which could not be cut back by 
investing the same funds in retrofitting any of the worst 
enterprises in any developed country. Besides, there is nowhere 
else to plant forests but in Russia.... 
  Frolov: Will we be able to rescue our ecosphere 
ourselves if aid is not provided for one reason or another? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: All data obtained in recent 
years prompt me to respond in the negative: Perhaps, we will not 
be able to. Irreversible changes in natural systems and the gene 
pool will occur faster than the economy developing without 
Western aid can become strong enough to restore nature. Nature 
cannot wait, and if things develop at the same pace, one 
generation from now there just will not be anyone to pull this 
weight. We have faced an ecological zugzwang, and have been 
dealt a blow which is the hardest to deflect from a direction 
that we have thought about the least.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Filimonov under the rubric "Ecology": </F>
"Underwater `Groundskeepers' Promise Us an Opportunity To Rest 
Easy"] 
  [Text] It was resolved at a meeting of an 
interdepartmental commission for ecological safety to embark on 
preservation of the Komsomolets nuclear submarine, which rests 
at the bottom of the North Sea. 
  At the outset there were several drafts. Over a period of 
three years a 30-volume work submitted by the Committee for 
Special Underwater Projects of the Government of Russia was 
selected on a competitive basis. More than 40 organizations took 
part in developing it. Specialists rejected the proposed 
scenarios for raising the Komsomolets. The reactor of the 
nuclear vessel is shut down and does not pose any danger. In 
addition, the gas which ensures a certain pressure level inside 
the reactor is subject to considerable outside pressure at a 
depth of 1,700 meters. If the Komsomolets is raised, the 
existing equilibrium will be disturbed. The danger is real that 
gas will force out a kind of "radioactive broth" which will 
cause pollution of the sea. This was not the least important 
reason why the project to seal two torpedoes with warheads which 
pose the greatest danger was preferred. 
  A special compound made of crab shells will be pumped into 
the unsealed torpedo tubes. Tengiz Borisov, one of the authors 
of the draft and the chairman of the Committee for Underwater 
Projects, is convinced that the use of such unique technology 
will guarantee the preservation of the submarine for 30 to 50 
years. The interdepartmental commission which is a part of the 
Security Council of Russia has confirmed the proposed draft. 
Underwater sealing work will begin in the summer of next year. 
Otherwise, the specialists expect leaching of the products of 
plutonium corrosion, a massive discharge of radioactive 
elements, and pollution of the natural environment for 600-700 
years by the end of 1994. Only domestic organizations are to be 
used for work. The St. Petersburg TsKB [Central Design Bureau] 
Rubin, the St. Petersburg Technology Institute, and a number of 
defense enterprises act as leading developers. 
  In the words of Tengiz Borisov, the main task of the 
committee is to conduct continuous ecological monitoring of 
Russian coastal waters. In the summer, the area of Novaya Zemlya 
where nuclear waste was actively dumped in the 1960's and 1970's 
was surveyed for the first time. The committee is also working 
vigorously on the use of the preservation technology to 
neutralize a tremendous amount of chemical ordnance in the 
Baltic Sea which was dumped by allied troops after World War II. 
  As the chairman says, the Committee for Underwater Projects 
which was created a year ago is called upon to play the role of 
a "groundskeeper" of the depths of the sea. Some 17,500 
containers with radioactive waste were dumped in the northern 
seas of Russia, 6,000 containers in the Far East. Eight nuclear 
reactors and two nuclear submarines rest in the Gulf of Biscay 
and near Cuban shores. The committee has offered a unique, just 
developed technology for the purification of liquid nuclear 
waste for joint use with the Japanese and South Koreans. If this 
technology is implemented, it will be possible to ultimately 
abandon the dumping of poisonous waste into the water as early 
as the coming year.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Demin under the rubric "Ecology": "Burning </F>
Gold"] 
  [Text] This is how V. Danilov-Danilyan, minister of 
environmental protection and natural resources of Russia, 
described the issue of garbage disposal in Russia and 
specifically in the Moscow region at a press conference devoted 
to ecological problems in our country held yesterday at the 
House of the Russian Press. 
  In the words of Viktor Ivanovich, in developed European 
countries household waste is sorted and either recycled or 
burned. In our country, everything is burned without 
distinction, producing smoke which does nothing to improve the 
ecological situation in the country. Millions of rubles go up in 
smoke. This happens because there are neither specialists in 
sorting waste nor special plants. On the whole, the ecological 
situation in Russia is critical, but for now nothing can be done 
about it: In a country with a sick economy, the environment will 
also suffer. Mr. Danilov-Danilyan stated that inspectors of the 
environmental protection inspectorate are frequently unable to 
even assess fines against enterprises: They run to billions, and 
enterprises may go bankrupt, leaving hundreds of thousands of 
people out on the street. Meanwhile, Russia has only 16,000 
ecology specialists.

comment] 
  [Text] The first domestically-produced plant for the 
purification of drinking water from highly toxic admixtures will 
be tested in the capital of Bashkortostan. 
  Ecological disasters following the releases of highly toxic 
organic compounds in Bashkiria of 1990-92 have stimulated the 
development of a domestically-produced system for the protection 
of drinking water from dioxine and other super-ecotoxicants. For 
the development of a special technology and equipment more than 
ten Russian institutes have joined their efforts. Also 
participating in this work are scientists from the United 
States, Sweden and the Federal Republic of Germany. The project 
is financed by the Mayor's Office of Ufa and the Mac-Arthur 
Foundation of the United States. The project has no equal in 
world practice, since the country's chemical plants insured a 
unique "working area," having contaminated vast territories and 
water basins. The contents of dioxines done in the drinking 
water of Ufa during the peaks of the outbreaks exceeded the 
permissible level by more than ten times. 
  The technological cycle for the unit is being worked out by 
the VODGEO [expansion not given] Research Institute. As the head 
of the project Alexander Smirnov put it, the results obtained by 
the present time make it possible to hope that the problem will 
be solved with the use of Russian technologies and materials. 
The expenses for removing dioxines, according to VODGEO 
estimates, will make up 25-30&percnt; of the total 
water-purification 
expenses.

paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment] 
  [Text] An ecologically pure technology of producing 
secondary metal has been developed at the Institute of 
Electro-Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
  After the disintegration of the USSR the commercially 
developed lead deposits for Russia's customers found themselves 
outside of the country's borders, whilst the price of lead from 
the CIS countries is quite often higher than it is on the world 
market. At the same time the demand for it can, to a 
considerable extent, be met by using the storage batteries which 
have exhausted their service life. In the industrially advanced 
countries up to 95&percnt; of used batteries are processed, and 
75&percnt; 
of requirements in lead are being met with secondary metal 
obtained in such a way. Its cost is approximately three times 
less than primary. In Russia less than 50&percnt; of used 
batteries 
are being collected, which is creating a serious ecological 
problem. The nearly 90,000 tons of lead scattered annually in 
the environment contaminate it more than the releases from 
burning ethyl petrol. The pyrometallurgical method of the 
treatment of old batteries, used in our country, contaminates 
the environment with sulphur dioxide and lead aerosols. 
  The Electro-Chemistry Institute of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences has worked out an electrochemical technology which not 
only has a number of ecological advantages (absence of harmful 
effluents into the atmosphere, minimum amount of solid waste, 
closed cycle of water-supply), but is also economically more 
profitable than pyrometallurgical technology. 
  It is particularly convenient for the treatment of a small 
number of storage batteries (about 3,000 a year), which makes it 
possible to site production not far from the places where used 
batteries are collected and so save on the storage facilities 
and transportation expenses.

comment] 
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency-financed 
group of experts has found no reason for bringing the 
Chernobyl-type reactors to a halt at nuclear power stations in 
Russia and Lithuania. 
  The experts prepared their report on the results of the 
recent missions of ASSET (groups for appraising events at atomic 
power stations from the standpoint of their safety) which 
carefully studied the work of four of the five stations with the 
RBMK-type fast reactors: The Kursk, Leningrad, Smolensk (Russia) 
and Ignalina (Lithuania) stations. The experts' field of vision 
did not include the Chernobyl Atomic Power Station inasmuch as 
Ukraine planned to bring it to a final halt (in October the 
Ukrainian parliament decided nevertheless to keep the ChAPS 
alive). 
  The experts also took a look into the March incident at the 
Leningrad APS (destruction of the gating valve in the third 
unit). As a result, such valves at all the stations with RBMK 
reactors were replaced with the mechanisms of the latest design, 
and the methods for detecting defects were improved. 
  The IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] experts 
stated: 
the steam coefficient of reactivity (a parameter determining the 
reactor's inner safety not dependent on personnel) had been 
lowered tenfold since 1986. They spoke highly of the work of 
operators, saying that the culture on most safety was growing. 
An appraisal which is not only flattering but even most 
unexpected (considering the destructive processes in industry 
and power engineering), yet its objectivity is beyond all doubt. 
  Their conclusion--there is no need to stop the RBMK reactors 
(given, of course, the timely implementation of ASSET's 
recommendations for ensuring the safety of each APS). 
  In parallel with the work of ASSET's missions revising 
primarily the reactors' safe operation, an effort is currently 
underway to implement the international project of the 
Commission of the European Communities whose participants 
investigate the dependability of the RBMK's design solutions. 
With this aim in view a consortium of Western countries was set 
up with the participation of Finland, France, Germany, Italy, 
Sweden and Britain (who were later joined by Canada and Spain). 
As many as nine joint subject groups were formed and have 
carried out active since the spring of 1993. 
  By the end of the year they must prepare a report containing 
an appraisal of the existing APS with RBMK reactors and 
recommendations for enhancing their safety. But already now John 
Tyror, chairman of the committee in charge of the project, has 
found it possible to say that "the experts have found nothing 
serious which would prevent people from sleeping quietly." This 
statement by one of Britain's leading nuclear scientists sounds 
all the more meaningfully since previously Mr Tyror believed 
that the RBMK reactors were not consistent with European safety 
standards. A more detailed acquaintance with these reactors made 
him change his mind, whereas the generally positive and 
sufficiently optimistic appraisal of the RBMK by two independent 
international groups of experts makes it possible to hope that 
the accident, provoked by the gross mistakes of the personnel of 
the Chernobyl Atomic Power Station, has not finally discredited 
the idea of channel reactors.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.I. Romanov, chairman of the All-Russian </F>
Association of Trade Union Organizations From Regions With 
Adverse Ecological Conditions (EKOASSPROF), by Viktor Ukolov; 
place and date not given: "Do Not Drink or Breathe, or Else You 
Will Die. EKOASSPROF Chairman Vasiliy Romanov Maintains: `The 
Ecological Crisis Has Spread to Virtually All of Russia'"] 
  [Text] There is no need to introduce Vasiliy Romanov 
to our readers. Trade union activists know him as the former 
deputy chairman of the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade 
Unions of Russia]. When a new team came to lead the Federation 
after the October events and the extraordinary Congress that 
followed, he focused on work in the All-Russian Association of 
Trade Union Organizations From Regions With Adverse Ecological 
Conditions (EKOASSPROF). 
  Ukolov: Are you waiting it out in a quiet haven? 
Vasiliy Ivanovich, pardon me for this tactless question. 
  Romanov: I do not consider concern about the 
health of the working people to be something of a rear echelon. 
Traditionally, it has been above all for trade unions. 
  Of course, this is a very extensive field of activities. 
There is room for executive organs, entrepreneurs, and public 
organizations alike to apply themselves. We cannot 
procrastinate--the life expectancy of Russians is falling 
sharply, the birth rate is declining. Specialists project that 
if emergency measures are not taken, by the end of the century 
Russia will turn into a sick society with a low percentage of 
healthy people. 
  Ukolov: I know that for you this is not just 
scientific research and projections; you have had occasion to 
inhale smog yourself.... 
  Romanov: Indeed, I lived and worked for almost 30 
years in the Kuzbass, which is actually an ecological disaster 
zone. The population is under continuous pressure from the 
heavy, poisoned air. Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk, Prokopyevsk.... 
When the air is still there is nothing to inhale. It is 
dangerous to go outdoors, people faint. I remember that classes 
were canceled in schools. This is why I did not hesitate when 
comrades proposed that I head the ecological association of 
trade unions (EKOASSPROF). 
  Ukolov: Is this a major organization? 
  Romanov: It was formed relatively recently, in 
July, but 53 regional interunion associations (trade union 
councils of republics, krays, and oblasts) have already joined 
it. The number will increase. 
  Let us talk of broad issues. To this day Russia lacks a 
state 
ecological policy, and health issues are not considered a 
priority in the process of economic reforms in Russia. 
  At present, in the course of the preelection debate, I 
diligently search for things that diverse "friends of the 
people" contending for seats in the Duma are promising Russians 
as far as healthy living is concerned. I am surprised; they are 
silent as if they had a mouthful of water. 
  Ukolov: If this water is from foreign bottles this 
would be possible, but if it is our running water it is risky. 
  Romanov: This surfaced in one of the newspapers: 
ecological laws are an excessive economic burden on Russia, and 
it is hardly feasible for the new parliament to consider them. 
In short, it is cheaper to blow off the future of the Russian 
people. However, the issue is "either-or": either die or live. 
  Ukolov: Do you think that the association will tip 
the scales toward a favorable outcome? 
  Romanov: We have no intention of surrendering. We 
will work on specific measures to improve the ecological 
situation at enterprises and places of residence. This is the 
first point. Second, we should overcome the ecological 
illiteracy of the populace. We will try to devise a system of 
prompt information for the people concerning what they inhale 
and drink. We should get used to such messages as we did to 
weather reports. We should know how to take self-defense 
measures as long as it is useless to attach hopes to the state. 
To facilitate the provision of preparations and drugs to victims 
is also a task of the EKOASSPROF. 
  An applied scientific conference which is scheduled to be 
held in Kemerovo in January-February of next year will serve as 
a prologue for the creation of regulations. At the conference we 
will ponder a mechanism necessary for the official recognition 
of ecological disaster zones and the requisite procedures for 
compensation for harm done to the health of the people and their 
property. 
  This is what is strange at present; why do they now charge 
us 
an arm and a leg for everything: The system of consumer services 
has driven up prices, and power generation.... Everyone says 
that he operates in a market economy. However, why should I pay 
the entire 100 percent of the price for dirty water which I am 
forced to drink? 
  In Russia more than 60 million people reside in an 
environment of high gas content and extreme air pollution. About 
50 percent of the population of the country use water for 
drinking which does not meet hygiene requirements on various 
indicators. Why do we pay for that in full? 
  Here is an equally "naive" question: Why is someone 
deliberately trying to cut short my life, which my mother and 
God have given me? On what grounds? 
  Ukolov: Simmer down, Vasiliy Ivanovich. Let us 
turn to the draft Constitution of Russia which is to be 
submitted to a referendum on 12 December. Article 42: "Everyone 
shall have the right to a favorable environment and authentic 
information about its condition, as well as compensation for 
damages inflicted on his health or property by violations of 
ecological law." 
  Romanov: For now this is a hollow declaration. The 
trade union ecological association is specifically undertaking 
to prepare regulatory acts in order to translate very good words 
into equally wise actions. 
  Since we have touched on the draft Constitution, I will note 
that great powers granted to the components of the Federation 
are built into it, including those to solve the most acute 
ecological problems. Alas, we do not have a single republic, 
kray, or oblast in which these problems are not acute to some 
degree. This means that regional trade union organs should work 
long and hard together with the local authorities in order to 
make the residence of their fellow citizens safe. 
  The Days of Defense Against Ecological Dangers, from 15 
April 
to 5 June 1994, will become a major and memorable action which, 
I hope. will be useful for all citizens. The EKOASSPROF is among 
its organizers. The Day of Remembrance for those who died in 
radiation accidents and disasters on 26 April and the World 
Environmental Protection Day on 5 June will be the focal events. 
  Ukolov: Let us agree on this: This event requires 
a separate conversation, and we will postpone it for now. 
However, here is my last and perhaps somewhat improper question: 
Vasiliy Ivanovich, you were forced out of leadership positions 
in the FITUR because, as I understand it, you are a proponent of 
forcible methods for conflict resolution, one of the originators 
of the ill-fated Collective Action Plan which incurred the wrath 
of the powers that be. As a result, they nearly "stamped out" 
the entire FITUR. Therefore, have you overcome your nature or 
not? 
  Romanov: I believed and still believe that 
collective actions of the working people are a regular means to 
protect their socioeconomic interests which, incidentally is 
provided for in the constitutions of all civilized states. It is 
primarily proper and effective when the government or 
entrepreneurial side violates the previously achieved 
agreements. However, this highly significant decision should, of 
course, be made by the primary organizations, their sectoral 
trade unions, and associations themselves.

Forced To Drink Contaminated Water"] 
  [Text] Some 61 million people living in the Volga River 
basin in Russia are forced to use highly contaminated drinking 
water, which is making increased chlorination necessary, thus 
damaging the health of the population. 
  This was stated at a joint session of the Russian Ecology 
and 
Natural Resources Ministry collegium and republic State 
Sanitation and Epidemiology Inspectorate. According to the 
collegium's data, no territory in the Volga area has health and 
hygiene and microbiological standards for the quality of 
drinking water. The ecological situation has become most 
unsatisfactory in the Cherepovtsy, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, 
Saratov, Volgograd, and Astrakhan industrial centers, where 
there is a high level of pollution due to petroleum products, 
phenols, and other compounds.

  [Text] Tokyo December 10 TASS-- Russia offered Japan 
cooperation in liquidating radioactive waste of the Pacific 
Fleet and in building a storage for fissile nuclear materials 
released as a result of disarmament. Documents to this effect 
were submitted on Thursday to the Japanese Government during 
two-day consultations in Tokyo. The Russian side was 
represented at the consultations by a delegation led by 
academician Nikolay Laverov, vice-president of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences. 
  When discussing possible disposal of liquid low-active waste 
produced by nuclear-powered submarines of the Pacific Fleet, the 
Russian delegation, which included representatives of the Navy, 
suggested calculating how much it will cost to stop dumping 
these wastes into the world ocean and to build facilities for 
their complete recycling. Another proposal provides for the 
construction not far from the Siberian city of Tomsk of a 
storage for uranium and plutonium released in the process of 
dismantling nuclear warheads. 
  Commenting on the Russian projects in an interview with 
TASS, 
Nikolay Yegorov, a member of the delegation and Russian deputy 
minister for nuclear power engineering, stressed that in this 
manner the Russian side displayed an initiative to promote 
implementation of the agreements reached, specifically, during 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo this October. 
Yegorov noted that Japan's participation in both projects would 
not cost it more than 6 mln dollars out of the 100 mln dollars 
of the earlier announced financial assistance to the former 
Soviet Union's nuclear disarmament. In any case, Moscow is 
ready to shoulder the lion's share of expenses. 
  The Japanese side, represented at the meeting by experts of 
the Foreign Ministry, scientific and technical department and 
the Ministry for Foreign Trade and Industry, showed a great 
interest not only in Russia's proposals, but in the very 
possibility of exchange of opinions between nuclear specialists. 
An official of the scientific and technical department gave a 
positive assessment to the consultations and stressed that Japan 
favoured this initiative and was ready to go ahead with it.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Gorbachev: "Seven Years With Risk of </F>
Long-Range Consequences"] 
  [Text] Bryansk Oblast-Moscow--According to data 
provided by scientists, more than 2 million people in Russia 
(including 550,000 children) who reside in territory whose soil 
has a cesium-137 contamination density greater than 1 
curie/square kilometer were subject to the influence of 
radiation in 1992. Even in view of this, the Russian 
"Chernobylers" are in no hurry to abandon the contaminated zone. 
Cottages that have been constructed for them lie empty. 
  The day following the explosion in the Belarusian Chernobyl, 
a red cloud hung over the skies of Baturovka in Bryansk Oblast. 
A day later, many people experienced nosebleeds. Baturovka fell 
within the radioactive contamination zone, the intensity of 
which presupposed mandatory resettlement of people out of these 
territories... 
  To this day people in the zone have been trying to live the 
way they did prior to 1986, as if the Chernobyl events had not 
put an end to the previously established order of affairs. Farms 
continue to turn over meat, milk, potatoes, and other 
agricultural output to the state. Krasnogorskiy Rayon, for 
example, is expected to deliver 500 tonnes of meat and 520 
tonnes of milk this year. Potatoes are sold at the price of R18 
per kilogram, which does not fully compensate for expenses. 
Vasiliy Khandoshko, chairman of Baturovka Sovkhoz, proposed that 
I act as intermediary between the sovkhoz and Moscow in selling 
potatoes at R50 per kilogram. However, I refused... 
  They do not like instigators in Baturovka. They believe all 
the problems stem from them. They are therefore very suspicions 
of someone new in the area. The words "moving" and "cows" are 
forbidden topics here. When cows are reluctantly discussed, it 
is with the challenge: "No matter what Chernobyl horrors you 
want to talk about, I will be lost without my livelihood." 
  Milk for human consumption in the zone is an extremely 
dangerous item. Immediately following the accident, a ban was 
placed on putting livestock out to pasture. Then they had the 
cattle compulsorily moved out of sight and slaughtered. Local 
residents reconciled themselves to the loss so long as "clean" 
products were being delivered to the sovkhoz. Soon, however, the 
deliveries of milk, cheese, and butter ceased. Baturovka 
residents then ignored the ban and again brought in livestock. 
  For the older people, it is an extremely bitter pill to 
abandon their native land, in which their ancestors lie and to 
which they themselves have become so attached. Some are unable 
to endure the ordeal of moving and pass away a year or two after 
arriving at a new location. Many return. 
  It is not only the old people who return. Five families 
returned to their sovkhoz from Zhukovskiy Rayon. Machine 
operators and vehicle drivers, they were never able to find 
work--only boiler operators and odd-jobs workers were needed in 
the new location. And even here the money was not good and the 
jobs called for "unskilled laborers." In addition, the new 
settlements in question do not yet have schools, kindergartens, 
or stores. 
  Three young families forced to leave Kyrgyzstan settled 
recently in Baturovka. For about six months, Olga Zavtonova's 
husband searched all over Russia for a place that could provide 
housing and an opportunity to begin working. The housing 
situation proved so difficult in the Russian interior that the 
Zavtonovs decided to resettle here with their children--where 
they were immediately provided a brick house. But Olga worries 
all the same: How dangerous is it to live in Baturovka? 
  Nor does Vladimir Ushakov properly know the degree of danger 
present. Born and raised in Baturovka, Ushakov was 17 years old 
when the accident occurred. He served his time in the Army, 
returned to the village, became a driver, and got married. A 
year and a half ago, a child was born to the family. In 
Vladimir's words, doctors are constantly checking the family for 
"accumulation of radionuclides" in their bodies. Figures are 
cited during every visit. But what exactly do these figures 
mean? Then again, the Ushakovs do not have any particular need 
to decipher them--they are better off just being quiet about 
things... 
  P.S. In Moscow I looked up Dmitriy Chuksin, deputy 
head of the Department for Environmental Monitoring and Land 
Rehabilitation of the Russian Federation State Committee on 
Chernobyl, and asked him to comment on the situation in Bryansk 
Oblast. Chuksin initially proposed that the committee be paid a 
fee for information he provided (which, as I immediately 
guessed, would be directed towards implementation of the program 
for eliminating the aftereffects of the accident). But in my 
private conversation with him, Mr. Chuksin told me that a draft 
new concept for residing in the region had been drawn up by the 
committee. It was their position, he stated, that living on the 
lands subject to the influence of radiation (except for the most 
dangerous zones--the exclusion and resettlement zones), 
including Krasnogorskiy Rayon, where this correspondent was at 
the time, "entailed risk, but was possible." 
  Russian Academy of Sciences Professor Irina Pelevina, a 
radiobiologist in charge of the laboratory for research in the 
long-range consequences of the influence of radiation of the 
Chemical Physics Institute, provided her commentary on this 
subject: 
  "My own point of view often diverges from the position of 
representatives of the State Committee on Chernobyl and that of 
the Bryansk Oblast Administration, as well as from the opinion 
of certain Russian scientists who declare the possibility of 
residing 'safely' in territories suffering the consequences of 
the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant." 
  "Human life in these regions is linked with constant 
exposure 
to radiation in small doses over the course of a long period of 
time. This situation is fraught with long-range effects (an 
example of which is the appearance of malignant tumors). The 
'risk of emergence of long-range consequences' increases as the 
irradiation dosage increases. But there is also a risk 
associated with long-term exposure to small doses. In this 
regard, such consequences may take quite some time before 
becoming manifest--hence use of the word 'long-range'! For 
example, leukoses usually appear after a maximum period of eight 
to 10 years, tumors of all varieties--after 20-40 years." 
  "If we take the point of view that a 'risk of long-range 
consequences' exists in inhabited regions, even with respect to 
a small number of people, then it is simply criminal under such 
conditions to refer to safe living."

  [Text] Funds are needed immediately if Russia is to dispose 
of liquid nuclear waste (LNW) safely. Their dumping into the 
sea was halted in response to international protest against the 
disposal of a small amount in the Sea of Japan on October 17. 
The authorities said that they had no other choice at that time. 
  Experts in the Environment Protection Ministry of Russia say 
that in recent years the total amount of LNW in navy ships and 
repair yards has been stable at 18,000 to 20,000 cubic meters a 
year. However, as utilization of nuclear submarines continues in 
the coming years, that amount is expected to increase by 20 to 
30 percent by the year 2000. 
  Russia has just one facility which meets international 
standards and is capable of neutralizing all kinds of LNW at a 
rate of 22.5 cubic meters per hour. It is installed in the 
Atomflot enterprise, Murmansk, and serves nuclear icebreakers. 
To neutralize all the LNW of the Northern Fleet the enterprise 
would need nearly 2 Bn rubles in 1994. 
  The Northern and Pacific Fleets have one special-purpose 
tanker each which carries LNW neutralization units but their 
performance does not meet international standards. The 
upgrading of the units would cost nearly 3 Bn rubles. 
  Experts believe that if funds for these projects are made 
available soon, by the end of the first quarter of 1994 the LNW 
neutralization would be less of a problem and by the end of the 
next year there would be no need to dump LNW in the sea.

  [Text] Moscow December 17 TASS -- Slovakian Minister for 
the Environment Jozef Zlochi visited Moscow from December 14-17 
at the invitation of Russian minister for the Environment and 
Natural Resources Viktor Danilov-Danilyan. The sides discussed 
problems of ecological cooperation. 
  They noted that there was much in common between the Russian 
and Slovakian nature-protecting methods. Both ministers believe 
that cooperation between the two countries should be primarily 
focused on the protection of the atmosphere from pollution, on 
environmental monitoring, and on the effort to discard, render 
harmless, and utilise household, industrial, and agricultural 
wastes, on the improvement of the environment in all the 
populated localities. 
  The sides are also plan to exchange information on new 
ecologically clean nature protection techniques, on the 
establishment of databanks containing information on various 
aspects of scientific, engineering and business activities in 
the sphere of ecology, on the elaboration of scientific and 
technological programmes, and on steps to promote their 
implementation.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Dec -- The situation regarding the 
Pacific's Fleet's storage of liquid radioactive waste is 
catastrophic. Storage facilities are full to overflowing, and if 
the problem is not solved over the next few weeks, they can 
rupture and radioactive waste will be discharged into the ocean 
in the Far East. This was stated by Viktor Kutsenko, head of 
the chief directorate of ecological safety of the Russian 
Ministry of Environment Protection, who was attending today's 
roundtable meeting on the problems of the burial of nuclear 
waste held at the Peace to Oceans international committee. 
  Captain First Rank Yevgeniy Romanov, representing the 
Russian 
Navy and head of section at the Navy's chief technical 
directorate, who was present at the meeting, also expressed 
fears that if urgent measures are not taken, an ecological 
disaster is possible in the Far East. He added that the 
merchant fleet vessel TNT-27 was full of radiocative waste. The 
TNT-5 vessel also holds 400 cubic meters of radioactive waste. 
These vessels are old and unfit to carry a large quantity of 
liquid radioactive waste, and no one can guarantee that they 
will not sink at the quay, said the Navy's representative. 
  Measures to utilize radioactive waste, under consideration 
at 
the Environment Protection Ministry, with the participation of 
Navy experts, are thought to take a year to implement, while 
these vessels are in no position to wait a year, said Romanov. 
He noted that in view of the extreme situation, the Navy 
intends to ask the Russian Government for permission to carry 
out a controlled discharge of liquid radioactive waste in 
Russia's territorial waters in the Far East. 
  In October 1993 a merchant vessel carried out a partial 
discharge of low toxic waste in the Pacific Ocean and this made 
Japan very indignant. Kutsenko said that this waste posed no 
danger. Its radioactivity was so low that it did not have to be 
classified as radioactive at all. The scientist also noted that 
the Pacific Fleet would need 10 billion rubles or several 
hundred million dollars to utilize liquid radioactive waste. 
Japan's promise to assist Russia in setting up liquid 
radioactive waste reprocessing facilities so far remains only a 
promise. At the same time, the Japanese are themselves 
discharging similar waste in the Pacific. 
  According to an international convention, signed in 1972, 
the 
discharge of radioactive waste is banned in international waters 
throughout the world, while any state is free to do as it sees 
fit within its own territorial waters.

  [Text] Tokyo December 20 TASS--Russia will have to dump 
liquid radioactive waste into the sea for at least the next two 
years, according to Valeriy Danilyan, head of the Pacific Fleet 
Chemical Defense Service. 
  Danilyan is in Tokyo to participate in the two-day 
Russian-Japanese consultations on the prevention of radioactive 
waste dumping into the sea. In an interview with ITAR-TASS on 
Monday, he said that even if western countries launch an 
immediate aid to Russia to build special facilities to utilize 
liquid radioactive waste, it will take two years at the minimum 
to complete the work. "During this period we will have to dump 
waste into the sea if no alternative solution is found," he said. 
  "Two specialised tankers the Pacific Fleet has to store 
radioactive waste, which, by the way, are almost beyond repairs, 
are completely full. If the waste is not vented, then there 
will be no place to store new low-toxic waste to be released 
from dismantled nuclear submarines," Danilyan said. 
  At present 17 nuclear submarines have already been 
dismantled 
and 50 more are awaiting their turn, he added. Danilyan also 
pointed out that the radioactive discharge into the Sea of Japan 
in October has not damaged the environment. He noted, while 
stressing that this is his personal point of view, that "the 
discharge of liquid low-toxic waste does not pose any threat." 
  He also believes that the best place to dump radioactive 
waste is the open waters of the Pacific Ocean which are far away 
from the territorial waters of all states of the region. "But 
our tankers cannot sail far away from the coast because they 
were built more than 30 years ago and have long become 
obsolete," Danilyan concluded.

  [Text] Corrosion is going at a high rate in the Komsomolets 
nuclear submarine that sank in the Norwegian Sea, Tengiz 
Borisov, chairman of the Russian government's Underwater Works 
Commission, said at a news conference in Moscow Wednesday. 
  The submarine sank on April 7, 1989. It carried two 
torpedoes with nuclear warheads and four conventional torpedoes. 
Komsomolets was the third Soviet submarine that sank as a 
result of a technical failure. 
  Borisov said that raising the submarine was out of the 
question because its titanium hull, torpedo compartment hatch 
rods and bodies of the torpedoes, notably carrying nuclear 
warheads, were damaged. 
  Even though the nuclear reactor of the submarine was 
damaged, 
it was said to be safe with the radiation leak level being about 
10 Ci per liter but the possible disintegration of torpedo 
nuclear warheads might result in leakage of plutonium and 
environmental damage. 
  Borisov said that plans were about to be finalized to seal 
the torpedo compartment of Komsomolets. The works, he said, 
will be carried out next summer at a cost of one to two billion 
rubles. The Russian government was said to have made a decision 
to appropriate the funds. Once the sealing is done, Borisov 
said, a program of extracting nuclear warheads from the 
submarine will have to be devised.

  [Text] Tokyo, 22 Dec -- Overall, the Russian delegation 
gives a positive assessment of the results of the two-day 
Russian-Japanese consultations on the problem of preventing 
Russian discharges of radioactive waste into the sea in the Far 
East, that ended in Tokyo today. This was stated in an 
interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent by Mikhail Kokeyev, 
head of the Russian delegation, and deputy head of the 
Directorate of International Scientific and Technical 
Cooperation of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. 
  He said that at the consultations agreement had been reached 
in principle that Japan will provide emergency assistance to 
take measures aimed at averting the need for the Pacific Fleet 
to carry out new marine discharges of low-level radioactive 
waste. For this purpose, it is planned, in particular, to 
provide Russia with a special tanker to store waste. The two 
tankers that the Pacific Fleet has at its disposal for this 
purpose are already full. "Some other emergency measures are 
also possible that Japan intends to take to render us 
assistance," Mikhail Kokeyev noted. He let it be understood 
that it was a matter of really emergency measures which could be 
carried out within "the next few days or weeks." The head of 
the Russian delegation stressed, that apart from emergency 
measures, Tokyo will also give Russia assistance in implementing 
long-term programs intended to avert the discharge by the 
Russian Navy of low-level radioactive liquid wastes into the 
waters of the world's oceans. 
  Mikhail Kokeyev noted that the reaction displayed by Tokyo 
to 
the discharge by Russia of low-level waste into the Sea of Japan 
in mid- October had been constructive. "Japan did not limit 
itself to expressing concern about this -- Tokyo immediately 
stated that it was ready to give assistance to Moscow in 
resolving this complicated problem," the high-ranking official 
of the Russian Foreign Ministry stated.

  [Text] [Sergeyev over video of Mayak Chemical Combine 
exterior, interior] Shortly after the war, weapons-grade 
plutonium for the first Soviet atom bomb was obtained here at 
the Mayak Chemical Combine in the secret city of Chelyabinsk-65. 
Over the past 40-plus years more than 1,000,000 curies of 
radio-nuclides have accumulated here on the industrial site of 
one of Russia's major defense complexes in water reservoirs and 
special technological storage facilities. They present a 
serious threat not just to the Urals region but the whole planet. 
  [Academician N.P. Laverov, vice president of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, identified by caption] This is a very 
complex problem. There has been nothing like this in the 
history of mankind. There has never been such an accumulation 
of radioactive waste. Therefore any step which is taken now 
demands careful scientific substantiation. 
  [Sergeyev] The Russian Government has adopted a program for 
the rehabilitation of the contaminated areas in the southern 
Urals. Scientists have been assigned an important role in its 
implementation. A session of the scientific and technical 
council has been held at Chelyabinsk-65, where specialists 
discussed the results of the steps taken in the year that is 
ending and elaborated tactics for combatting the dangerous 
radio-nuclides for the coming year. [video shows exterior,

  [Text] Moscow December 27 TASS -- The dumping of 
radioactive wastes into the Sea of Japan could be avoided if 
Russia "got very urgent aid from its partners," in particular 
from Japan, Russian Minister for the Protection of the 
Environment and Natural Resources Viktor Danilov-Danilyan told 
ITAR-TASS today. 
  The minister mentioned, as part of this aid, a mobile 
installation for processing liquid radioactive wastes. Huge 
quantities of liquid wastes have accumulated on tankers and an 
accident may occur on one of them at any time. Russia has no 
capacities in the Far East to process liquid wastes. "A 
submarine cannot be dumped into a garbage bin like a child's 
toy," Danilov- Danilyan said. Liquid wastes will continue to 
accumulate for another five years even if Russia decided to 
liquidate its Navy. 
  "At the present time, Russian experts have drawn up a plan 
and timetable for building liquid radioactive wastes processing 
installations. It will be discussed by the government shortly," 
the minister stated. The fulfilment of this programme requires 
not only much money -- 10 billion roubles, but also time (about 
two years). Therefore, "Japan will either have to agree to a 
regular disposal of wastes or provide Russia with an 
installation to process them," Danilov-Danilyan stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatol Darafeyew, chairman of the Belarus </F>
Republic State Committee on Ecology, by Valeryy Charnyawski: 
"`Today No One Has the Right To Profit at the Expense of Others 
and Poison the Environment Expense.' Chairman of the Belarus 
Republic State Committee on Ecology States His Views on 
Environmental Problems"; date and place not given] 
  [Text] We are not living well today, and we are 
treating the environment even worse. We note, moreover, that 
almost everybody sincerely blames everybody else for the 
crisis--while presuming, of course, to be the forests' and 
rivers' best friend and protector. 
  One suspects, however, that the long suffering 
environment might wish to submit some bills to many decent 
citizens. In this regard, we have a question for the republic's 
chief ecologist: 
  Charnyawski: Anatol Maksimavich, excuse my 
bluntness, but in matters of ecology we are barbarians and 
ignoramuses. You know more examples than I. Here is one: last 
year in Pukhavitski Rayon, during a hot dry spell, some 
blackened firemen were putting out a fire in a peat bog, while 
literally a kilometer away from there some healthy youngsters 
were arrogantly "having some fun" with a routine bonfire. Common 
logic protests against such barbarism; admonishment is not 
enough, punishment is needed! 
  Darafeyew: I don't need to argue something that is 
so obvious; in past years not enough was done to protect the 
environment and create a healthy habitat for human beings. I 
will emphasize that conditions today are even worse and, in many 
cases, simply critical. 
  People's treatment of the environment? Your Pukhavitski 
example is just one small typical event. Almost 99 percent of 
fires, including forest fires, are due to individuals who 
destroy the environment and yet consider themselves decent 
citizens. Recent events all over the CIS have shown the barbaric 
depths people can sink to in relations with one another, so why 
not take out their wrath on the environment, which cannot answer 
back?! 
  Politics, the ideology of confrontation, the ruined economy, 
and skyrocketing prices are also factors. Food is such a problem 
that poachers of all stripes have launched, so to speak, a 
"massive assault" on the forests, rivers, and lakes. And if 
state and civic organizations responsible for the protection of 
wildlife and fish resources don't take appropriate measures, in 
two or three years we won't have any forests or wildlife, and 
the only rabbit we'll see is on banknotes.... 
  Charnyawski: And then the very existence of 
homo sapiens will be in question.... 
  Darafeyew: I say that in order to prevent this 
frightful occurrence we need to exert massive influence on the 
people's consciousness and enhance human reason--naturally, 
along with new laws and state measures designed to impose more 
liability for damaging the environment. 
  By the way, for the most active segment of society new 
environmental laws have done practically everything needed to 
make them feel like they really are the masters in this matter. 
For the first time in our history, ordinary citizens and 
individuals have the right to demand and receive detailed 
information from state organizations and officials. They have 
the right to propose bans on the construction of ecologically 
hazardous facilities, and to institute suit in court to recover 
damages done to their health or property as a result of 
violations of environmental laws. 
  Charnyawski: But so far, what you call the "active 
segment" is decidedly in the minority. I am not a pessimist, but 
I regret to say that our "ecological barbarians," whose name is 
legion, couldn't care less about these new rights of theirs. All 
they care about is the "right" to plunder nature and damage it. 
That's why enterprise directors (who are all "men of the 
people") largely behave that way, and their ability to "conquer" 
nature has grown a hundredfold. Let's recall, incidently, the 
relatively recent amounts of fines levied, which are ridiculous: 
10 rubles for an individual, 100 rubles for an executive. And 
how are we to "pressure" the numerous violators now, if nobody 
fears God, the Devil, or the law? 
  Darafeyew: Never mind; everybody looks after his 
own pocket. Fines today are not what they were once, neither is 
the principle of exacting them. In connection with the passing 
of the Law "On Protection of the Environment," the question of 
economic regulation of the exploitation of natural resources and 
environmental protection has taken a brand new turn--the 
economic mechanism has come into play. A harsher system of 
fines, court actions, and penalties for dumping harmful wastes 
in the environment has been created, applicable both to 
enterprises and to individuals. 
  Penalties now are more than a slap on the wrist. The 
starting 
point is the minimum salary, followed by higher rates. If our 
agencies or, for example, the foresters of the Ministry of 
Forestry, gets their hands on somebody, it is going to go very 
hard on them. 
  What's sad is that we have long had a working example right 
next door in Europe, and other places besides. In our country, 
as you know, we spent decades indulging in ideological 
self-glorification, saying that the capitalists were rapaciously 
plundering the environment; we never wrote that they were 
protecting it. 
  To be sure, we also have started to fight the despoilers of 
nature, but only since the "new era," I'd say. I'm referring to 
a case in the late spring of 1990 in which, due to the criminal 
negligence of an operator in the Navapolatski Palimir 
Association, 90 tonnes of acetone cyanohydrin--a powerful 
poison--were dumped into the Western Dvina. The chief engineer 
was fired, while the operator wound up in court. So that one way 
or another we do have some experience "putting scoundrels in 
their place." 
  Charnyawski: Anatol Maksimavich, I notice you have 
mentioned the new "Law on Environmental Protection" several 
times. For good reason, I think. I propose, therefore, having 
commented on the deplorable state of society today and the fact 
that under such conditions environmental protection cannot be 
much better, you give some thought to what that protection ought 
to be in fact and how everything new is to be instilled in human 
consciousness and actual practice. There is plenty of doubt, and 
all of it real. 
  One article in the Law states that enterprises are to 
provide 
your committee with information about accidents, emissions, and 
other negative phenomena--and all "free of charge!" As if I 
would work against myself if I were the director! If I did that, 
where would I wind up in a day or two?! 
  Darafeyew: A businessman's personal ambitions are 
one thing, the interests of the state are quite another. What is 
at issue here is the overall monitoring of the environment. The 
republic is creating an ecology monitoring system which will be 
implemented by the State Committee on Ecology and other agencies 
empowered to do so. Like it or not, anyone involved in the 
production process is obliged by law to submit detailed 
information in order to create a general ecology information 
bank. 
  Are you saying people will cheat? That's quite possible. In 
addition to departmental control our own control will be on hand 
in the enterprises; organs of the State Committee on Ecology 
keep track of production conditions using their own instruments, 
and discrepancies show up quite often. Let me remind would-be 
conspirators that they will be liable--perhaps even criminally 
liable--for submitting false information or failing to submit 
information. 
  You have said that the departmental control service often 
takes violators under its wing to protect them from liability. 
We know that, and that's why our relations with them are 
critical. Because our State Committee is now a 
supra-departmental body, we have the right to check up on 
everybody, on any ministry or department. If we find any 
cheating, it will be punished. Let everyone keep in mind that 
users of natural resources themselves bear responsibility for 
improper use of resources and treatment of the environment. This 
is only civilized and fair; the principle is stipulated by the 
laws of all developed countries. 
  The trouble is that we are in the clutches of the "wild" 
market and the economic crisis. In such conditions, I agree, 
implementing the new legislation is going to be painful to 
production collectives. 
  Charnyawski: Let me get back to the mentality of 
business executives, because some of them are really in a fix. 
Just how, if you please, can a man tell the world that 
everything in his plant is leaking and smoking, the plumbing is 
shot, yet production has been met? What if the enterprise has to 
be closed as a polluter? What then, thousands of people on the 
sidewalk out of work? 
  On the other hand, there are lots of monopoly plants whose 
collectives are coddled too much. All the profits and 
considerable state subsidies are plowed into wages, and nobody 
thinks about the ecology or perfecting the technology. Overall, 
there is a slide into truly savage capitalism and rapacious 
exploitation of resources. 
  Darafeyew: There's real food for thought. There 
are many enterprises where salaries are high and they are 
spending hard currency for--excuse the expression--glad rags and 
Toyotas in the West, but as for investing to improve the 
ecological situation, no way. The new law proposes a new 
approach: make them pay big for improper use of resources. 
Unhappy with the big payments? Then fix your technology. That's 
it. 
  Remember that under the command economy, enormous 
investments 
were made in new technologies, but hardly anybody thought about 
technological progress, and ecological spending was nowhere. The 
economic policy of the Law "On Protection of the Environment" 
will definitely change this mentality. No one will be allowed 
anymore to profit at the expense of others and poison the 
environment while not investing a ruble to renovate it. 
  Consider this fact, which has not had much play here in 
Belarus. At the conference on environmental problems and 
development, which was held in Brazil under the auspices of the 
UN, the whole world proclaimed the priority of the ecology. We 
do, after all, live in a civilized world. But if we don't 
civilize ourselves on the plane of ecology, we will remain 
isolated "savages"--and it will be reflected both in our 
standard of living and in relations toward us. 
  When it comes to our aging industries, how can we shut them 
all down? There's just one way--by using economic levers and 
ecology laws, to pressure their collectives so that they will at 
least start to gradually change their technologies. Consider the 
West: do you think they've closed all the heating and power 
facilities that run on coal? They could have, because the cost 
of smoke scrubbing technologies comes to about 70 percent of the 
cost of the enterprises. What they did was redesign them the way 
they should be. 
  Charnyawski: With a bit of fantasy we might 
imagine that in time we might make industrial and other 
enterprises act "polite." But what about having the military pay 
for the damage done to the environment and human health? Anybody 
who knows those unapproachable and unassailable gods the 
generals will probably never believe it. In Hungary, Poland, and 
the Czech Republic, claims are literally pouring in against 
former Soviet military installations for environmental damages. 
But in our case.... If anybody is going to pay a fine, it will 
come from the budget, which means from the taxpayer's pockets. 
Isn't that right? 
  Darafeyew: You're mistaken there. Times are 
different now, the old taboos are gone that used to keep people 
outside the gates of the military. As far back as two years ago, 
there were cases in which military units were severely punished 
for damages to the environment and ecological accidents. 
  We now have operating a special group to service military 
facilities and grant them ecological certification. Now, 
military commanders are ranked the same as civilian 
executives--the same approach applies to all: if you do damage 
you can just pay the penalty. You refuse? There are 
environmental and military procuracies to take care of that. 
  To be sure, they do keep a "cut" for themselves, for their 
military cost--and it all comes from the state budget. Now, 
however, commanders also bear individual responsibility for 
ecological violations. In the new amended Administrative Code 
(as amendments to the law), all this will be stipulated 
legislatively. Relations between the State Committee and the 
Defense Ministry are generally good, and whenever some commander 
violates ecological regulations--maliciously--we can complain 
about him to the ministry, and the next time you look he'll have 
one less star on his epaulet. 
  Charnyawski: Once everything is on a civilized 
footing, in the future, society will be able to boast that the 
"military impact" on the ecology has been reduced to a minimum. 
But who will protect us from depredations against the 
environment by the local Soviets which have been given such 
expanded powers by this legislation? 
  I believe that many local leaders are ecologically ignorant. 
They might, for example, put up a hazardous asphalt plant in a 
summer residential area or commit some other unpardonable 
stupidity for hard currency. Do you know, Anatol Maksimavich, 
where rayon bosses sometimes put monies from the ecology tax and 
non-budget environmental funds? 
  Darafeyew: Now I agree with you there. Officials 
of rayons where there are big industrial polluters will do 
anything to see to it that the latters' fees for the use of 
resources go into their own coffers and stay there. What the 
other rayons get is the pollution plume. In such cases, no funds 
remain to form ecology programs in the oblasts and the republic. 
  But such rayon bosses, even when they do get the money, are 
not overly concerned with creating any "ecological paradise" in 
their area. Their aspirations are much more primitive--first, of 
course, to make a lot of money along with their apparatus; next, 
to acquire various prestigious "toys." In other words, they act 
on the principle "After us the deluge; who cares about the 
ecology?" 
  To a certain extent, of course, the local Soviets have to be 
independent, but they are also supposed to comply with general 
laws. The alternative is legal nihilism and anything-goes, with 
all the consequences. The Supreme Soviet should guarantee 
compliance, along with our State Committee within the limits 
stimulated by the Law. 
  I say that because there is a dangerous tendency to bring 
hazardous and polluting technologies into our country from the 
West. Consider this: someone has even proposed bringing 
contaminated soil into Belarus for processing, for which they 
would pay us in hard currency. As if we didn't have enough 
contaminated land after Chernobyl! 
  Again, one German firm proposed that Belarus buy (!) 
briquettes made from the sludge of treatment plants for use 
as... fertilizer. They don't rate us very highly in the West if 
they're trying to foist things off on us that even poor Africans 
would refuse. But we have to remember that we have plenty of 
local-yokel anti-ecologists who would make a deal like that for 
dollars or marks. Naturally, agencies of the State Committee are 
standing guard over the state's interests, but how can you keep 
track of every wheeler-dealer in the market? Remember, then, 
that whenever such a scheme is uncovered, its perpetrators will 
be severely punished. 
  Charnyawski: And so, Anatol Maksimavich, we come 
to where we started from: We have to have penalties, especially 
in such a neglected sector as the ecology. It is clear that our 
society is not yet prepared, either spiritually or mentally, to 
pass the needed ecological legislation. Will we ever overcome 
this block in the general consciousness? 
  Darafeyew: I'm not inclined to be a rosy optimist 
either by position or experience. And I won't predict that we 
are soon going to have English-style gardens and lawns 
everywhere and that the air will become crystal clear. Our 
optimism must be pointed toward the realization that through 
concerted efforts we can survive and not slide into ecological 
catastrophe. That is our chief problem of survival as a nation. 
All it takes is for each one of us, to some extent, to be the 
patriotic master of our land and a wise human being.

  [Text] Vilnius, Dec 20, BNS -- The second group of experts 
from the U.S. Department of Defense examined the level of 
environment pollution on the territory of Lithuanian military 
airports. 
  The former Soviet airfield in Zokniai, not far from the town 
of Siauliai, is less polluted than supposed earlier, experts 
said. They suggested to get rid of the waste in the upper layer 
of polluted soil and to start serious cleaning work when soil 
examination results are known. 
  The Russians took out several cubic meters of radioactive 
soil before the airport was handed over to Lithuania. 
  Lithuanian authorities intend to transform the former Soviet 
base into a free economic zone.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ion Dediu, minister of the environment </F>
of the Republic of Moldova, by Mihai Diac; place and date not 
given: "The Russians Exploited Our Chernozem Soil"] 
  [Text] On the occasion of the third national 
colloquy, organized by the Romanian Society for the Protection 
of the Atmosphere (SOROPA), Professor Ion Dediu, the minister of 
the environment of the Republic of Moldova, was kind enough to 
grant us a short interview. 
  Diac: How do you evaluate this symposium? 
  Dediu: In contrast to other ecological 
associations and movements, SOROPA is composed of specialists 
and technicians who are not motivated by profit. Currently, many 
see the problems of the environment as an opening for business. 
I would like to mention the professionalism of these 
nongovernmental movements, whose activities could be greatly 
assisted by the Ministries of the Environment and of Public 
Works and Land Improvement. If the ministers had been smarter 
and had exploited--in a positive manner--this initiative, which 
is benevolent and perhaps more sincere and honest than many 
others, even some in academic circles, I believe that the entire 
society would profit, not only the respective ministries. We, 
from the Republic of Moldova, are getting ready to pursue 
precisely this approach of the movements and ecological 
associations, which are geared toward the professionals. We have 
finally arrived at the stage of direct action, of uniting the 
activities of the ecological movements with those of the public 
organizations. I believe that the ministers do not have to 
direct these organizations, but can collaborate with them, and 
this would be mutually advantageous. Activity of this kind was a 
pleasant surprise for us; we discussed concrete questions, not 
demogogical ones. This is the way we need to have discussions, 
at the level of a board of directors or ministerial collegium. 
Romania is one of the first countries in Europe that has entered 
into the phase of concrete activities. It is a pity that other 
organizations, both here and in Moldova, have remained until now 
in a phase of strictly theoretical discussion. 
  Diac: In this respect, how do you see the 
collaboration between the governments of the Republic of Moldova 
and the Republic of Romania? 
  Dediu: I see it as an absolute and indisputable 
necessity. Since we announced a gradual strategy of economic, 
spiritual, and cultural integration two years ago, we must bring 
it about through concrete activities, starting with the 
juridical level and the harmonization of legislation, as, for 
example, in the domain of protection of the environment and the 
utilization of natural resources in the framework of some 
programs. We must not merely say from a podium that we want 
unity and that we want integration, because unity does not come 
from podiums or through words. We share this sacred work of 
integrating in a number of stages, and I believe that we should 
pass from the phase of commercial promises and arrive at 
concrete deeds concerning economic, cultural, and spiritual 
integration. I assure you that we will do that regardless of 
whether or not some people want it.... I believe that "H-hour" 
will arrive. There are some historical steps that cannot be 
stopped. 
  Diac: What is the situation in the Republic of 
Moldova from the environmental point of view? 
  Dediu: Compared to the other countries of the 
former Soviet Union, we have inherited the most degraded 
environment, with the possible exception of Tajikistan. And, 
overnight, we find ourselves "returning to Europe" -- I do not 
care for that expression. And we have the most degraded soil in 
Europe and the most polluted waters. Why? Because the former 
Soviet Union knew very well the significance of the Bessarabian 
chernozem, so they exploited it barbarously. At the beginning of 
the 1970's, when it was recognized that the "supply was running 
out," we began using fertilizers and pesticides.... And since 
the quality of the environment is tied to the quality of life, I 
can tell you that for these reasons, the average life expectancy 
in Bessarabia is 68, while the world's average is 72. The birth 
rate is the lowest of the past 50 years; the rate of occurrence 
of diseases directly influenced by the quality of the 
environment, such as cancer, gastrointestinal ulcers, cirrhosis, 
even cardiovascular problems, is twice as high as in other 
countries. And this when we have one of the oldest ecological 
cultures, a culture as refined as possible. Certainly, the 
communist, totalitarian regime bears the principal guilt, but 
where were we, where was our civic and national resistance?

  [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has approved a 
resolution on procedures for conducting state registration in 
the field of atmospheric air protection. The state's executive 
authorities, enterprises, departments, and organizations, 
regardless of their ownership status, are obliged to comply with 
the resolution. The document emphasizes that the main goals of 
state registration in the field of atmospheric air protection 
are collecting data on facilities that contribute or may 
contribute to atmospheric pollution, making assessments on the 
volume of harmful substances emitted into the atmosphere, and 
evaluating the influence of different physical and biological 
factors on air pollution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Kostenko, minister of environmental </F>
protection of Ukraine, people's deputy of Ukraine, by an 
unidentified correspondent of NARODNA ARMIYA; place and date not 
given: "National Security. The Ecological Aspect"] 
  [Text] Yuriy Kostenko, minister of environmental 
protection of Ukraine, answers questions put by a NARODNA ARMIYA 
correspondent. 
  We will introduce our interlocutor. 
  He was born in 1951 in the Vinnitsa area. He graduated 
from the Zaporozhye Institute of Machine Building, worked at the 
imeni E.O. Paton Institute of Electrical Welding, and also 
completed graduate study there. He defended his Candidate of 
Sciences dissertation in the area of plasma technologies. 
Kostenko has more than 30 certificates of authorship and 
scientific publications. 
  He has been people's deputy of Ukraine since 1990. 
Kostenko has been elected deputy chairman of the parliamentary 
commission for issues of ecology and the rational use of natural 
resources. 
  Kostenko has been the minister of environmental 
protection of Ukraine since October 1992. He is a member of the 
National Security Council of Ukraine. 
<H3>  `The Scope of the Ecological Threat May Be Greater Than That 
of Any Aggression....' </H3>
  NARODNA ARMIYA: Yuriy Ivanovych, recently the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine discussed a package of the national 
security issues of our young state. To your mind, how 
significant has the ecological aspect of the system of national 
security guarantees become? 
  Kostenko: The economic development of society has 
reached such heights toward the end of the 20th century that the 
threat of losing a favorable environment for the residence of 
people has become a reality. Our own bitter experience can be a 
case in point. The degree of unfavorable influence on the 
natural environment in many regions of Ukraine has now surpassed 
the consequences of the most devastating military aggression. 
  At present, nobody can say with certainty whether at some 
point children will be able to take walks in the city of 
Pripyat, whether it will be possible to drink water from the 
Dnieper without worrying, to swim safely at the sunny beaches of 
Mariupol, Odessa, and Yalta, or eat mushrooms from the forests 
in the area of Lugansk without risking one's life. 
  Under existing conditions, the ecological aspect of the 
system of national security of our state should be virtually the 
main one. However, we should state that in Ukraine, all levels 
of society lack the understanding that ecological threats in 
terms of their scope and the extent of unfavorable influences 
may surpass the consequences of any aggression. 
<H3>  `A Perpetual-Motion Machine for Processing Natural Resources 
Into Waste' </H3>
  NARODNA ARMIYA: What caused, to the greatest 
degree, and continues to cause the dangerous condition of the 
environment in Ukraine? 
  Kostenko: Within the system of national security 
of the state, ecological threats are due to both domestic and 
external reasons. That is to say that they are regional or 
global in nature. Our conviction is that, all the weight of the 
external aspects of ecological security notwithstanding, the 
critical condition of the natural environment that has emerged 
in Ukraine is due mostly to domestic reasons. 
  The nonecological development of industry, the power sector, 
and transportation; erroneous land-use practices; large-scale 
land reclamation efforts; infective activities aimed at 
preserving natural landscapes and their components--forests, 
lakes, rivers, steppes, and so on--are among the main reasons. 
  Ukraine's industry is one of the most dangerous in the world 
from the ecological point of view. Think about this: In the late 
1980's, two times more iron ore than in the United States was 
produced in Ukraine, and only somewhat less coal than in Great 
Britain, France, and the FRG combined. As much steel was smelted 
annually as in the FRG and France combined. Ukraine's industry 
manufactured 7 million tonnes of pipes, which exceeded the 
combined output of Great Britain, Italy, and France. 
  What did we get in return? Did our standard of living rise 
to 
the level of the countries mentioned? Has a single social 
problem been solved in the Donbass or the Dnieper area? We may 
say "no" with confidence. Instead, we have had a rapid depletion 
of natural resources, man-made mountains of rock, poisoned air, 
and dead rivers. 
  A similar situation has developed in power generation. The 
proportion of the discharge of harmful compounds into the 
atmosphere of Ukraine by power generation comes to 30 percent of 
the total discharge. Coal dressing produces 35 million tonnes of 
barren rock annually. The reservoirs of hydropower stations 
occupy almost 800,000 hectares of fertile land; approximately 
the same area is underflooded. 
  As far as nuclear energy is concerned, the great probability 
of accidents with grave consequences forces us to classify 
nuclear power stations as the greatest ecological threat. The 
Chernobyl catastrophe alone has exhausted, for hundreds of years 
to come, the ecological reserve of all accidents of 
technological origin in Ukraine. Besides, the further operation 
of nuclear-energy facilities will be unavoidably accompanied by 
the accumulation of a large amount of radioactive waste. They do 
not just pollute the environment, but also pose the threat of 
irreversible changes both to the population of Ukraine and to 
all living organisms. 
  In addition to dangerous waste, the Ukrainian economy is one 
of the largest consumers of natural resources in the world. 
Land, minerals, water, air, and energy resources are devoured by 
enterprises in ever greater amounts. It is characteristic that, 
for example, we continuously have a shortage of 
electricity--even now that the overall level of production has 
declined by 30-40 percent--although our power generation per 
capita is at the level of the developed countries of Europe. Yet 
this is not surprising if we take into account the fact that the 
energy intensiveness of our production exceeds that of similar 
indicators in countries such as the United States, Germany, or 
Great Britain by factors ranging from six to eight. 
  Thus, the national economy of Ukraine even now functions 
mostly in keeping with the principle, "Production for 
production's sake." This is why instead of an economy that would 
primarily meet the needs of the people, we have something of a 
perpetual-motion machine for processing natural resources into 
waste. Without breaking this vicious cycle, a solution to the 
ecological problems of Ukraine, and consequently guarantees of 
its national security, are out of the question. 
  NARODNA ARMIYA: What is the ecological status of 
the agro-industrial complex? 
  Kostenko: Not the best. The share of plowed land 
in the territory of Ukraine has reached 57 percent (in the 
United States, it is 17 percent). One-third of these areas have 
been depleted and are subjected to intensive erosion. If we do 
not reduce the percentage of plowed land by way of both 
environmental protection measures and changes in the tax system, 
Ukraine may be left without its famous Chernozem soils. 
  Unjustified and incompetent land reclamation has caused a 
great deal of trouble! I will give you only a few numbers, which 
are based on data from scientific establishments. During the 
years of land reclamation, the area of drained land in Polesye 
has doubled, and the danger of deflation and soil erosion has 
increased by a factor of 27. In the southern regions, changes in 
irrigation technology are needed on 18 percent of the irrigated 
land. As little as just over one-third of the irrigated land 
remains in good condition there. 
  The intake of water to meet economic needs has been growing 
continuously. The runoff of many rivers is taken in full in 
years with low, and even average, water availability. The 
inclusion of small rivers into land reclamation systems and the 
thoughtless draining of marshlands have resulted in disruptions 
of their hydrological regimen; the quality of natural water and 
its self-purification capacity have deteriorated. 
  The current condition of our forests is critical. They 
occupy 
one-half of the area that they do in adjacent states--Poland, 
Slovakia, and Belarus. Only 6 percent of our forests are mature, 
whereas 15-20 percent should be. 
<H3>  `We Will Not Accomplish Anything in the Absence of a Strong 
Policy of Environmental Protection' </H3>
  NARODNA ARMIYA: Yuriy Ivanovych, what major 
shortcomings do you see in the organization of efforts to 
protect the environment in our country? What should be done 
specifically in the context of guaranteeing our national 
security? 
  Kostenko: First of all, it should be grasped at 
all levels of state government that improvements in the natural 
environment are impossible in the absence of a clear-cut 
program, continuous attention and, certainly, considerable 
material and financial outlays. 
  What do we have at present? Our own state budget is the most 
instructive in this regard. It allocates only 0.2 percent of the 
gross national product (GNP) for all environmental protection 
measures in 1993. For comparison, Scandinavian countries spend 
close to 1 percent of their GNP just to help other states. The 
fact that economic losses reach one-tenth of the entire gross 
national product in Ukraine as a result of deterioration in the 
quality of the environment testifies to our short-sightedness. 
  Moreover, the Ministry of Natural Resources, which in 
keeping 
with legislation in effect is supposed to ensure compliance with 
the norms of ecological safety in Ukraine, controls as little as 
one-tenth of these funds, of these purely symbolic budget 
outlays for the protection of natural resources, or 0.02 percent 
of the GNP. This does not happen in any other country in the 
world! Our ministry has an extremely broad scope of 
responsibilities, but the main levers of influence, financial 
levers, are virtually absent. Therefore, degradation of the 
environment with all of its terrible consequences will not be 
stopped without fundamental changes in the system of 
guaranteeing ecological safety, and without a strong 
environmental-protection policy for the state. 
  NARODNA ARMIYA: Nonetheless, what has already been 
specifically done by the Ministry of Environmental Protection in 
order to stop, or at least, to begin with, slow down the slide 
of Ukraine into the ecological abyss? 
  Kostenko: Fundamental principles for this work 
have been developed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
of Ukraine with the participation of a broad circle of 
scientists and specialists from the national economy in the 
concept of the National Program for Protecting the Natural 
Environment, which we plan to submit for consideration to the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine in November-December of this year. 
  The experience of developed countries testifies that for the 
most part, two levers exist that stimulate ecologically friendly 
production and energy savings. These are the use of natural 
resources at a fee and the active implementation of 
environmental protection measures. 
  Proceeding from this, the ministry wants to devise a 
mechanism for assessing the cost of natural resources and fees 
for their use, to introduce tax relief for resource-effective 
and ecologically pure technologies, and to impose economic 
sanctions for the above-the-norm use of natural resources and 
pollution of the environment, so that it will become 
economically disadvantageous for enterprises to operate to the 
detriment of nature. 
  It is precisely to this end that a special section, 
"Ecological-Economic Policy," was included in our proposal for 
the plan of actions of the Government of Ukraine to implement 
and develop the Foundations of the National Economic Policy in 
1993. A government decree issued in September introduced norms 
for the size of ecological losses associated with environmental 
pollution and the use of resources. Proposals have been prepared 
concerning the establishment of a fixed proportion of state 
budget expenditures for environmental protection measures and 
mechanisms for their implementation. The Source ecological bank 
has been established. 
  Let us not forget that there are types of environmental 
protection projects that do not require considerable funds, in 
particular appropriations from the state budget, and are found 
within the jurisdiction of the local organs of power. The issue 
is that the plowing of the bank zones of small rivers should 
finally stop; straightening their courses and siting cattle 
farms and complexes and fertilizer and pesticide warehouses in 
their water-protection zones should be forbidden, and efforts to 
develop meadows on the banks of small rivers should be made. In 
this instance, a favorable environmental protection effect may 
be secured as soon as within a few years. It was precisely to 
invigorate such efforts that the Green Spring campaign was held 
in Ukraine on the initiative of the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection. 
<H3>  `If We Do Not Put Up a Barrier to the Illegal Imports of 
Toxic Substances From Abroad, Ukraine Will Turn Into a European 
Trash Dump Rather Than a European State' </H3>
  NARODNA ARMIYA: You said that the issues of 
ecological security have an international aspect, as well.... 
  Kostenko: Yes, and a quite weighty one, too. 
External ecological threats may be either intentional, i.e., 
ecological aggression, or unintentional in nature--most 
frequently, these are global changes in the environment and 
crossborder pollution. 
  We want to mitigate the unfavorable influence of global 
ecological changes primarily by making and executing 
international agreements that regulate the planetary stress of 
technical origin and by developing national measures for the 
adaptation of the national economy of the country to these 
changes. 
  Ukraine has already joined most conventions regulating 
global 
ecological security. Nonetheless, it should be said openly that 
we are still not ready to implement some of them. Thus, Ukraine 
still does not have a national program to carry out the Montreal 
Protocol on the Ozone Layer. Meanwhile, its conditions call for 
abandoning the use of substances that destroy this layer by 1999. 
  Ukraine still has not ratified a number of important 
international agreements. The Ministry of Environmental 
Protection proposes to ratify them shortly. At issue are, in 
particular, the convention on climatic changes, which restricts 
the discharge of gases producing the greenhouse effect, the 
biodiversity convention, the Ramsar convention on the protection 
of wetlands on our planet, and the convention on international 
trade in the species of wild fauna and flora that are threatened 
with extinction. 
  As far as measures to adapt the economy of Ukraine to global 
ecological changes are concerned, their development is 
envisioned by the aforementioned concept of the National Program 
for Protecting the Natural Environment. 
  NARODNA ARMIYA: In the last two years, the 
uncontrolled importation of various types of waste to the 
territory of Ukraine has become particularly notorious. 
  Kostenko: Indeed, this ecologically dangerous dirt 
is brought in under the guise of a raw material, products of the 
chemical industry, fertilizer, and so on. Importation of 
dangerous substances to seven oblasts of Ukraine was registered 
in the first half of this year alone. Some 700 tonnes of these 
substances fall into the highest class of toxicity--they are 
poison to anything that lives. 
  However, it is perhaps the most terrifying thing that what 
has been registered constitutes, so to say, the tip of an 
iceberg, merely a fraction of what is brought in and illegally 
dumped by the roads, in the forests, in the fields, and in 
ravines. This is the consequence of an absence in our country of 
an effective system for the regulation and monitoring of the 
importation of waste. If we do not put up an effective barrier 
to the illegal imports of toxic substances from abroad, very 
soon Ukraine will turn into a European trash dump rather than 
the European state that all of us wish for. 
  For this reason, the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
has 
developed Temporary Procedures for the Issuance of Permits to 
Import to Ukraine Recyclable Raw Materials and the Waste That 
Replaces Them, which, in particular, prohibits the importation 
of waste to Ukraine for the purpose of storing and burying it. 
Appropriate instructions have been given to the local 
subdivisions of the ministry. A proposal has been submitted to 
the government to establish an ecological control service at the 
border. 
<H3>  `The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection Carry a Weighty Proportion of Responsibility for the 
National Security of Ukraine. We Should Work Hand in Hand....' </H3>
  NARODNA ARMIYA: There is no concealing the fact 
that units of the Army and the Navy have contributed 
considerably to the processes of deterioration if not the direct 
destruction of the environment.... 
  Kostenko: Yes, until recently, the activities of 
the military involving the use of natural resources fell beyond 
the limits of the jurisdiction of our ministry. The actual 
absence of control did not result in anything good. The examples 
of it are without number. 
  Favorable changes in relations between the Ministry of 
Defense and the Ministry of Environmental Protection have 
emerged only over the last 1-1.5 years, after the adoption of 
the new legislation on environmental protection. Efforts have 
been made to establish special ecological subdivisions of the 
Ministry of Defense, ecological inspections have begun to 
operate jointly. It is gratifying that the recently introduced 
provisional Internal Service Manual includes a specific 
provision that binds all commanders to work out and implement 
environmental protection measures. 
  Thus, the first specific results have been attained at the 
level of ministries, which is not the case directly with most 
units and garrisons. 
  The Ministry of Environmental Protection is aware of the 
facts of violations of environmental protection legislation, 
especially at the Yavor training grounds in Lvov Oblast, which 
occupy 20,000 hectares. Meanwhile, these training grounds are 
located in a unique natural zone of the Ukrainian Roztochchya, 
where the main European watershed passes and runoff to the 
basins of the Black and Baltic Seas is generated. Considerable 
harm is done to valuable natural complexes at the "Free Port" 
training grounds of the Black Sea Fleet aviation, which is 
located in the center of the Black Sea Biospheric Preserve. In 
general, it is hard to find a military unit or garrison that is 
not violating legislation on environmental protection in one way 
or another. 
  In general, both our ministries carry their proportion of 
responsibility for the national security of Ukraine. Therefore, 
we should work hand in hand. 
  Efforts to create a system of national security for Ukraine 
are under way. The ecological aspect of this problem that is the 
most significant for our young state should be properly codified 
by legislation. Only by taking an extensive set of ecological 
security measures will Ukraine be able to overcome the critical 
condition of the environment and become one of the economically 
developed and prosperous countries of Europe.

  [Text] It has been over six years since the disastrous 
Chernobyl breakdown, which is compared by some specialists to a 
nuclear war. Meanwhile, other dramatic events have shaken the 
world, and the international community has forgotten the 
Chernobyl nuclear plant. Ukraine has been left almost alone 
with its post- Chernobyl problems, which, despite all the 
forecasts, do not disappear, but grow in numbers. It is not 
possible to cope with the scope of tasks without help. The 
Supreme Council Committee for Issues of the Chernobyl Aftermath 
has held a press conference for Ukrainian and foreign 
journalists devoted to these problems. 
  A new problem has appeared, in addition to the old ones, 
reported Professor Kopeykin, who has been working in Chernobyl 
since the first days of the disaster, often without any 
remuneration. All forecasts on the disintegration of 
radioactive fall-out were too optimistic. Nobody was 
anticipating that disintegrated plutonium would appear, but the 
professor found it in the vicinity of the "red forest" in 1989. 
Dangerous derivatives of plutonium decay were discovered -- 
americium and curium. The issue of including americium in the 
legislation concerning Chernobyl aftereffects is currently on 
the agenda. Due to americium's inclination to migrate, the 
resettlement zone may be expanded. 
  After all, no one knows where will the winds blow from... 
Additionally, another issue seems very strange: Why are we 
calling on the international community to cooperate in 
liquidating the aftereffects of the disaster, while 
simultaneously adopting a resolution on continued operation of 
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant? Will the radioactive threat 
be more compelling this way? There is already enough evidence -- 
strontium can be found near Turkey and Italy, not mentioning CIS 
countries. It is quite understandable why the Belarusian 
legislature issued a statement objecting to the resolution. The 
entire world, not only our neighbors, has criticized our 
position on this issue... 
  Explanations such us "if we stop the Chernobyl plant, we 
will 
freeze in the winter" are naive. As Volodymyr Usatenko, head of 
the Committee for Scientific, Social, and Legal Issues, 
emphasized, power units at the Chernobyl power plant, which are 
using 70 percent of their capabilities due to various 
malfunctions, are not even able to provide heat for the northern 
part of Kiev Oblast. To purchase five-year supplies of fuel for 
the plant, Ukraine needs 350 billion rubles, and it simply does 
not have such money... 
  Last year, pointed out Deputy Attorney General Olha Kolinko, 
no official of the five ministries that are responsible for 
liquidating Chernobyl aftereffects visited the troubled zone, 
which is becoming a zone of crime.
