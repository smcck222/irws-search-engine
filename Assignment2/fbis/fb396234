<F P=106> [Commentary by Ahmad al-Qasir: ``The World Community </F>
Unanimously Endorsed Egypt's Call To Free the Middle East of 
Nuclear Weapons''] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The world community showed its 
appreciation for Egypt's role and continuous efforts to 
safeguard world peace when the UN General Assembly unanimously 
backed Egypt's draft resolution to free the Middle East of 
nuclear weapons. The resolution called on all countries 
concerned to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to 
place their nuclear weapons under the supervision of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  What makes this important step for consolidating world peace 
in this sensitive part of the world more significant is that the 
approval of Egypt's proposal to free the Middle East of nuclear 
weapons was coupled with another resolution, which Egypt voted 
for, on Israel's nuclear weapons. The resolution called 
directly on Israel to renounce the possession of nuclear weapons 
and join the nonproliferation treaty. 
  Egypt's call, which was backed by the UN General Assembly, 
was not born accidentally or imposed by certain circumstances. 
It stemmed from the Egyptian leadership's firm belief that 
world peace is indivisible and that it is high time to end the 
state of armed struggle in the Middle East so that the people 
may give more attention to economic and social development to 
create a better tomorrow for future generations. [passage 
omitted] 
  The UN General Assembly's resolution calling for freeing the 
Middle East of nuclear weapons is a practical way to help 
promote the ongoing peace efforts exerted by the international 
community. It will prevent those countries that possess nuclear 
weapons from threatening their neighbors and imposing their will 
on them. It will also prevent other countries from attempting 
to obtain these destructive weapons in a bid to ward off the 
nuclear threat against them. In addition, it will help put the 
brakes on all types of arms races by the region's countries and 
eliminate all potential hazards that may result from radiation 
in the densely populated Middle East region. More importantly, 
the resolution paves the way for the disputing parties to regain 
confidence in each other, which would ultimately help them meet 
half way to achieve a just peace that guarantees the legitimate 
rights of all the region's countries. 
  Egypt's call to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons is a 
new addition to the extensive efforts that President Mubarak has 
been exerting for years to promote peace between the Arabs and 
Israel at the international level. At the same time, it affirms 
Egypt's deep belief in the strategy of peace as the only way for 
reaching an understanding among the region's countries and 
highlights the need for all countries in the region not to 
violate it, regardless of the excuses they use as a facade. 
Through the United Nations, Egypt has opened the door for all 
regional countries to prove their goodwill and seriousness in 
their quest for peace and to get rid of nuclear weapons. When 
will the regional countries that possess nuclear weapons respond 
to the world community's peaceful call?

  [Text] The prime minister has said that the chemical 
weapons convention is a great step in the direction of 
disarmament and the most important pillar of any disarmament 
process is verification. Chairing the Consultative Committee 
meeting of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers in New 
Delhi, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao said the Chemical Weapons 
Convention is nondiscriminatory in its approach. This is the 
reason for which the verification methods adopted in the 
convention are compared favorably with similar efforts in the 
direction of disarmament. Mr. Narasima Rao emphasized that 
India is not making any chemical weapons and it has nothing to 
hide. He said India plans to train its chemical industry in a 
such a way that they are able to protect their commercial 
secrets while undergoing the inspection process.

  [Text] India today cautioned the United States that 
repealing the Pressler Amendment will legitimize Pakistan's 
clandestine nuclear weapons program. New Delhi also expressed 
concern that this will result in the delivery of the 
state-of-the-art F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, providing it with a 
greater number of delivery systems for weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  Speaking at a lunch hosted in honor of the visiting U.S. 
senators, including Mr. Pressler, the minister of state for 
external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, pointed out that Pakistan 
already acknowledges possessing weapons of mass destruction. He 
said the U.S. Administration move will, therefore, destabilize 
the South Asian region. In such a scenario, India will need to 
reappraise its defense policies. 
  The minister objected to India being lectured on the human 
rights issue, especially in the light of a commitment to 
democratic norms. Mr. Khurshid said India is faced with a proxy 
war in Kashmir. He made it clear that motivated propaganda 
against India on human rights will be counterproductive. The 
U.S. senators--Mr. Pressler, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Brown--are 
currently on a visit to several Asian countries. They will also 
hold talks with the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and the 
home minister, Mr. Chavan.

  [Text] Jerusalem, Dec 20 (AFP) -- Iran will within a year 
have North Korean-built missiles capable of hitting Israeli 
territory, according to the air force intelligence chief. 
  ``Iran will have Korean Nodong missiles in a year which 
could 
be deployed in the west of the country and reach Israel,'' 
Colonel ``A'' told the latest edition of the Israeli Air Force 
Review published on Monday. 
  ``There is no doubt that Iran is also trying to obtain the 
capacity to produce chemical and nuclear warheads,'' which could 
be carried by the Nodong, said the colonel whose identity is 
kept secret. 
  Pyongyang successfully test-fired the Nodong-1, a 
sophisticated Scud missiles with a range of about 1,000 
kilometres (600 miles) in May, according to Japan. 
  The colonel said Tehran was trying to develop aircraft and 
missiles ``directly threatening'' Israel and at the same time 
continuing a long-term nuclear programme. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said in August that Syria and 
probably Iran had received deliveries by Russian aircraft of 
North Korean Scud-C missiles with a range of 600 kilometres (370 
miles). 
  However, the colonel said Syria had not ordered any SA-10 or 
SA- 11 Russian surface-to-air missiles because of economic 
difficulties and a ``certain pause'' in the arms race linked to 
the Middle East peace process. 
  The colonel also said Iraq ``apparently'' still had missiles 
and launchers which U.N. disarmament inspectors had failed to 
locate. 
  Iraq launched 39 Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 
Gulf 
War killing one person, injuring hundreds and damaging thousands 
of homes.

<F P=106> [Political commentary: ``The IAEA Clarification: An Answer </F>
to the West's Babblings''] 
  [Text] Dr. Hans Blix, director general of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has stated that the outcome of the 
visit by IAEA inspectors to the Islamic Republic of Iran was 
very positive. 
  Handing this report to the IAEA in Vienna, he said that the 
agency's inspectors very freely inspected all of Iran's nuclear 
installations in Aban [month ending 21 November] and that 
officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran actively cooperated 
with this delegation. The IAEA chief said that this 
delegation's inspection of Iran's nuclear installations was an 
important step toward removing existing false ideas on the 
nuclear programs of some countries. 
  This is not the first time that the peaceful nature of the 
Islamic Republic's nuclear programs have been confirmed by the 
IAEA. Previously too, the IAEA sent delegations to inspect our 
country's nuclear installations and those delegations also 
emphasized the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs. 
  The IAEA's stance on the Islamic Republic of Iran is the 
clearest answer that can be given to babblings by hegemonistic 
powers that ignore that agency's reports and have always tried 
to falsely accuse the Islamic Republic of Iran in order to mask 
their own support for the nuclear arsenals of the regime 
occupying Jerusalem. Last year IAEA chief Hans Blix stated that 
Israel should also be included among the places where nuclear 
weapons are to be dismantled as part of the Middle East peace 
process. He stated that an area free from nuclear weapons 
requires that Israel also abandon its nuclear capability. 
Nevertheless, under pressures from America and other Western 
powers that support the regime occupying Palestine, he has never 
been able to send investigation teams to occupied Palestine. 
  Hans Blix's remarks clearly refer to the existence of 
nuclear 
weapons in occupied Palestine and to the Zionists' opposition to 
any effort to send delegations there. For years now the 
Zionists have been investing immensely on nuclear projects in 
occupied Palestine with American support. They are receiving 
all types of financial and technical support from the Americans 
in the manufacture of such weapons. Not only have the Zionists 
not hidden there efforts and the American support for their 
nuclear programs, but they have even very impudently been 
boasting about their progress in these projects. With America's 
political support, they are the only party to the Middle East 
compromise talks that is refusing to allow international teams 
to inspect their nuclear installations. This is a fact of which 
all the Arab regimes longing for peace with the regime occupying 
Jerusalem are aware; and Hans Blix and other high- ranking IAEA 
officials have also admitted this on several occasions during 
their visits to Middle East countries. 
  The fact is that if it is the IAEA's duty to prevent 
non-peaceful nuclear projects around the world, then it should 
begin to confront those governments that disregard all 
limitations on the use of weapons of mass destruction. The 
Americans and the Zionists have repeatedly proven with their 
actions that they do not recognize any laws, criteria, or 
commitments on the use of weapons of mass destruction or in 
perpetrating crimes against the human lives. Therefore, these 
are the governments that deserve stricter pressures by world 
forums. 
  If international laws and world commitments are so easily 
trampled on by impudent regimes that are not punished for their 
acts and if laws do not differentiate between obedient and 
disobedient governments, what our world recognizes as universal 
law will be nothing more than mere words on paper that only take 
up space in the archives of international bodies. The IAEA 
should be able to prove with its actions that it is not affected 
by pressures from any side.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Pressler Returns''] </F>
  [Text] A U.S. Congressional delegation that includes 
Senator Larry Pressler of the discriminatory Pakistan-specific 
Pressler Amendment fame, will be visiting Pakistan towards the 
middle of this month. Though, according to our Foreign Office, 
the visit is part of routine tours that the Congressmen 
undertake to areas of their interest during the Congressional 
recess, given the intensity of the United States' renewed focus 
on the nuclear non-proliferation issue, it is not hard to figure 
out that the point of their interest in this case is to bring 
around Pakistan to a rollback of its nuclear programme. On our 
part, successive governments have repeatedly made it clear to 
the U.S. that they would be willing to sign the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty] provided India agrees to a simultaneous 
ratification of the treaty or accepts Pakistan's proposal for a 
five-nation conference to achieve a regional non-proliferation 
regime. There is no ambiguity whatsoever in this country's 
stance on the issue that may need further clarifications or 
elaboration. And on the other side too, Sen. Pressler has 
continued to stick to his guns in subjecting this country to a 
discriminatory law of which he himself is the author. In fact 
he came visiting a couple of years ago also but that did not 
help him to see things in a fair and rational perspective. One 
wonders what more can Pakistan tell him about its position on 
the nuclear issue, or he to Pakistan on where he stands, that 
this nation already does not know through his consistent 
criticism of its nuclear programme and a punitive law that 
denies it eligibility to U.S. aid in some important defence 
equipment. Hence when Pressler comes again, along with some 
other members of the Congress, there is little the two sides can 
be expected to add to each other's knowledge on the chief issue 
of contention between them. 
  The one hope for optimism in the visit though may be that 
the 
Senator might have learnt something from the failure of his 
efforts at forcing this country into accepting what is 
unjustifiable by any standards of fairness. Then there is also 
the fact that face-to-face meeting among people tend to help 
them better understand each other's points of view. In that 
respect discussions with the other members of his delegation may 
lead to a productive exchange, and Sen. Pressler, having 
realised the futility of his exercise against Pakistan, might 
also be willing this time around to listen with an open mind and 
revise his position vis-a-vis both India and Pakistan. Other 
than this hope, there is not much that can be expected to come 
out of the Congressional visit.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Pressler's Visit and the Nuclear Program''] </F>
  [Text] Senator Larry Pressler accompanied by a three-member 
U.S. senators delegation arrived in Islamabad yesterday. The 
main force behind the Pressler Amendment will have met the prime 
minister and the foreign minister by the time this editorial is 
published. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador also called on Prime 
Minister Bhutto yesterday and expressed the hope that the U.S. 
aid to Pakistan would be resumed. During the meeting, the prime 
minister made it clear that Pakistan has the right to defend 
itself and it will definitely not roll back its nuclear program. 
  The U.S. senator's delegation has arrived in Pakistan at a 
time when the country is in the midst of debates and discussions 
on the nuclear issue. The visit assumes great significance in 
view of the fact that the United States not only suspended aid 
to Pakistan on the pretext of the nuclear program, but also 
resorted to the practice of harassing it. The visit is also 
significant in view of the impression being created by 
governmental circles that the present government will be able to 
restore U.S. aid without any ``compromise'' on the nuclear 
program; while the opposition is saying that the government has 
bowed to the U.S. conditions and that is why the aid is going to 
be restored. Unaware of the reality, the people are wondering 
whether to believe in what the present prime minister is saying 
or to accept as true the allegation by the former prime minister. 
  Confusion prevails even about Pakistan's nuclear program 
itself. India and the United States insist that we have crossed 
the red light. But our responsible figures are terming it as 
``[word indistinct].'' A statement by former foreign minister 
Agha Shahi was published in today's newspapers in which he 
claimed that Pakistan's nuclear program has been frozen. 
However, General Mirza Aslam Beg, the former chief of the army 
staff, while acknowledging the freezing of the program, has 
simultaneously claimed that Pakistan had acquired the 
weapon-manufacturing capability in 1987. 
  When people in responsible positions are not consistent in 
their statements, it naturally creates confusion. However, the 
main thing is the national interest. It has become evident from 
the debates held so far on the nuclear issue that our nuclear 
program is an inevitable necessity so far as the national 
security is concerned. And if we have so far been able to 
protect ourselves from Indian aggression, it is due mainly to 
the nuclear deterrent. It is a ``peaceful'' program in the sense 
that it provides a guarantee for peace and against war in this 
subcontinent. 
  We should clearly tell the United States and its delegated 
envoys that we have acquired the nuclear capability for peaceful 
purposes. And since we have acquired it through our own 
resources, it is therefore not possible for us to accept any 
conditions on it. How can the countries which went to extremes 
to restrain us from having a peaceful program--and tried to 
punish us by stopping economic and military aid--have the right 
to dictate to us on our nuclear program? As our program is 
aimed at securing peace and ending aggression, we will be ready 
to accept any reasonable proposal. Hoever, that will be only 
when India signs the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, accepts 
the world body's resolutions on all disputes, including the 
Kashmir issue, and implements them. 
  It is India which is the root cause of the disturbances in 
this region. No neighboring country can remain complacent about 
its defense unless India shuns its oppressive designs. The 
present government will do a service to the nation if it 
succeeds in convincing Pressler and his companions of Pakistan's 
nuclear stand. We hope that Pressler is not visiting Pakistan to 
force this country to accept his conditions, but to end the 
present coldness in Pakistan-U.S. relations and to attain a 
realistic perception of the problems and difficulties being 
faced by Pakistan. We also hope that he will return to 
Washington satisfied.

  [Text] Rawalpindi -- Terming as unjustified the Pressler 
amendment, chairman Senate Wasim Sajjad, on Wednesday said 
Pakistan will not compromise on the country's security. 
  Speaking at the oath taking ceremony of the office bearers 
of 
the Rewalpindi Press Club, the senate chairman said the 
amendment is discriminatory and has tilted the military balance 
in favour of India. He added no law and morality can permit 
such kind of legislation. 
  Wasim said the Pressler amendment has totally failed to 
achieve its objective of checking nuclear proliferation in the 
region. However it is causing harm to America's age old friend 
Pakistan. He said India exploded its nuclear device in 1971. 
U.S. experts have confirmed that India is also making missiles. 
  The Senate chairman maintained that India will achieve the 
capability in the year 2000 AD to make missiles which can even 
target the United States. He reminded that India has already 
made intermediate missiles. 
  In this situation, he said, imposition of Pressler amendment 
is one-sided and unjustified. He vowed ``we will render every 
sacrifice but will not bow before any discriminatory pressure.'' 
  He told the audience ``we have made it clear to the visiting 
U.S. Senators that Pakistan will turn to other options if 
Pressler law stays.'' He added that we can buy better military 
hardware on soft terms from other countries. 
  Wasim Sajjad said the amendment has affected our military 
defence capabilities which is deplorable in the existing 
circumstances. 
  Speaking on the Kashmir issue, the Senate chairman urged the 
media to project the Kashmir issue vigorously at all levels and 
air voice against the violations of human rights there. 
[sentence as published] 
  He said Western countries, specially the U.S. has started to 
realise the gravity of the Kashmir problem. 
  He said he had very useful talks with the U.S. Senators, and 
noted that U.S. desired a peaceful solution of Kashmir. 
  He expressed satisfaction over the realising of the 
violations of human rights in Kashmir by the Western countries. 
The House of Commons also desired an honorable solution to the 
Kashmir problem through use of the right of franchise to the 
Kashmiris, he added. 
  Wasim Sajjad said both government and the opposition should 
play their due role for strengthening the democratic process in 
the country and should also play their effective and 
constructive roles for the progress of the country. 
  It was high time, he added, to adopt a strategy and to 
introduce a system which guaranteed the integrity and solidarity 
of the country. 
  He said the early solution of Kashmir issue was imperative 
for the congenial atmosphere among the two neighbouring 
countries i.e. India and Pakistan. 
  He said Pakistan was facing various challenges including 
poverty, unemployment, health and education which need urgent 
attention of the government. 
  He said the press has the power to change human thinking. 
``I think responsibility of the national press has increased. 
Journalism is not only a profession but also a mission,'' Wasim 
Sajjad said adding the journalists should work to maintain 
peace, unity as well as promote positive thinking 
  He stressed that journalists should also play their positive 
role in increasing awareness among the masses to root out the 
causes hindering progress and prosperity of the country. 
  He paid glowing tributes to journalists for their sacrifices 
rendered for the freedom of press. 
  ``I believe in the freedom of expression as I consider it 
the 
first condition for strengthening a democratic system,'' he 
added.

U.S. Senators Thad Cochran, Hank Brown and Larry Pressler 
addressed a press conference at the American Centre in 
Islamabad. Terming their visit as fruitful, they said the 
discussions with Pakistani officials had provided them a greater 
understanding and a better perception of the importance of 
Pak-U.S. ties and of nurturing these relations in future. The 
Senators also tried to explain that all endeavours of the United 
States, including the Pressler Amendment, were basically mounted 
to stop the spread of nuclear weapons as more countries joining 
the present five nations nuclear club could endanger world peace. 
  Throughout the Press conference, the U.S. Senators harped on 
the same tune although, at times, they did not agree with each 
other's view. Senator Larry Pressler clearly took pride in his 
amendment and did not deny singling out Pakistan for its 
application. He said there were reports in the media during 
mid-80s that an Islamic Bomb was being prepared and that the 
technology might pass from one country to another. However, 
Senator Brown dismissed this idea and said there is no such 
thing as an Islamic Bomb and the United States had not focused 
only on Pakistan but on every country wherever the threat of a 
nuclear device existed. Both he and Senator Cochran made it 
clear that they did not share Pressler's views on singling out 
Pakistan under his amendment. Senator Cochran claimed that the 
Amendment was not against any particular country as ``Pakistan 
is on top of the countries we like.'' However, the most 
significant statement made at the Press conference was by 
Senator Larry Pressler when he said that both Pakistan and India 
are ready for the inspection of their nuclear facilities. ``The 
Pakistan Prime Minister told me exactly what the Indian Prime 
Minister had said in this context,'' he said. This is the first 
indication given at such a high diplomatic level by India that 
it may open its facilities for international inspection. If 
that is so, why does India refuse to sign the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) when Pakistan has several times 
stated that it is prepared to sign it simultaneously with it? It 
is strange Senator Larry Pressler did not put this question to 
the Indian Prime Minister. Although Senator Cochran accepted 
that ``very persuasive evidence has been given to us to show 
that the implementation of the Pressler. Amendment was against 
the interests of Pakistan and we will explore the options to do 
an evenhanded application of the law,'' Senator Pressler still 
refuses to support the move to bring changes in his amendment. 
It is hoped the Clinton administration would not let him have 
his way and make special efforts to have the new foreign 
assistance bill adopted by the Congress.

Vladimir Taranov] 
  [Text] Moscow December 16 TASS -- ``Russia together with 
other countries is welcoming the decision of the Supreme Soviet 
of Kazakhstan to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] 
as a member state not possessing nuclear weapons,'' Russian 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin said at a briefing 
today. 
  Thus, Kazakhstan's joining of the system of commitments 
based 
on the START-1 treaty and the 1992 Lisbon protocol has been 
completed from the legal point of view. ``Russia regards this 
step taken by Kazakhstan as a major contribution to the 
strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and to the 
ensuring of the nuclear arms reduction,'' he said. This is 
especially important now, because the non-proliferation regime 
has been jeopardized by the dangerous stand, taken by Ukraine. 
  According to Karasin, Russia would like to hope that the 
resolution, adopted by the Kazakh parliament, will set a good 
example for Ukraine. Whether an impetus will be given to the 
spreading of nuclear weapons all over the planet, or whether the 
mechanism of significant nuclear arms reductions, envisaged by 
the START-1 and START-2 treaties, will be set into motion, 
depends very much on the policy pursued by Ukraine.

<F P=106> [HOLOS UKRAYINY commentary: ``The Kremlin Fog''] </F>
  [Text] There is no doubt that the appeal by Russian 
designers, scientists, and specialists from the Atomic Energy 
Ministry to citizens and governments of world states appeared at 
the Kremlin's directive. Its goal is to intimidate the world 
with the dangerous state of Ukrainian nuclear warheads. 
However, concealed behind the pathos and demagoguery of the 
authors of the appeal is blatant deception meant for 
dilettantes. It is stressed in the appeal that the danger lies 
in the ``absence of systematic technological servicing,'' 
``failure to replace components in time,'' and ``conducting 
repairs not provided for by the specifications.'' However, it 
is... Russian specialists, who are supposed to watch and fulfill 
all of this together with our specialists. Yes, yes, precisely 
Russian. In accordance with the interstate agreement on 
scheduled and repair servicing of intercontinental ballistic 
missiles located on the Ukrainian territory. As Ukraine's Vice 
Prime Minister V. Shmarov pointed out at a recent news 
conference dealing with the ratification of START-1 by the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council, this agreement is presently being 
fulfilled, and there is no reason to be concerned about the 
state of the intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
  Nor are the Russian scientists sincere when the write the 
following in their appeal: ``Those politicians who maintain 
that nuclear munitions may be dismantled in Ukraine are not 
telling the truth.'' Not a single politician made any such 
statements anywhere. On the contrary, that same Valeriy Shmarov 
said at that same news conference that the nuclear warheads may 
only be dismantled at manufacturer plants, more specifically, in 
Russia. 
  Therefore, the appeal by Russian designers and scientists 
confuses the vile and the holy. Striving to obtain, as soon as 
possible, our intercontinental ballistic missiles, in addition 
to the already obtained operational and tactical nuclear 
weapons, to start selling nuclear weapons components in the 
West, and to earn further billions of dollars, the authors of 
the appeal, on the directive from the Kremlin, are trying to 
obscure the issue.

of this deadly chemical substance? Professor Novikov knows for

of mustard gas operational with the Armed Forces and located on 
Russian territory was measured precisely in these figures and 
that it has never been exported, destroyed, or dumped.

<F P=106> [Karl Rendel report: ``Foreign Experts Believe Leningrad </F>
Nuclear Power Station Has High Reputation''] 
  [Text] An international seminar has just finished at the 
Leningrad Nuclear Electric Power Station. It was held by the 
World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO). 
  ``Some 60 directors of, and experts in, nuclear electric 
power stations [AES] from 14 states came to Sosnovyy Bor, where 
the Leningrad power station is located,'' I was told by I. 
Valovich, vice director of WANO's Moscow center. ``For the 
first time in WANO's four-year existence, the interregional 
seminar was devoted to issues affecting the organization of 
repair work and technical servicing of nuclear power stations. 
We chose Sosnovyy Bor because we believe that the way in which 
the reactor units at the Leningrad AES have been reconstructed 
is instructive.'' 
  ``There is basically a big difference between the RBMK 
reactors we operate today and the ones we operated prior to the 
Chernobyl accident,'' Leningrad AES Director Anatoliy Yeperin 
stressed. ``We have introduced a number of new features, and 
our first reactor unit has been rebuilt and licensed by 
Gosatomnadzor [Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety] to operate at a full power of 1 million kilowatts. At 
the moment we are renovating the second reactor unit from both 
the engineering and technological viewpoint. Much of the work 
being carried out by our personnel, who are relying on creative 
collaboration with scientists, designers, planners, and fitters, 
is the first work of its kind that has ever been done in the 
world. Our experience is already being used as an example at 
the Kursk and Smolensk AES's.'' 
  Anatoliy Yeperin categorically rejected as unfounded the 
claims made by the authors of an IZVESTIYA article entitled 
``Agent of Extinction'' who said that the Leningrad power 
station was unsafe. The efforts made by the collective to 
increase the reliability of its equipment and safety of its 
operation have enabled the Ministry of Atomic Energy to grant 
Leningrad AES the rights of an operating organization. The 
station is not part of the ``Rosatomenergo'' concern, but 
Gosatomnadzor, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the 
foreign experts who have frequented Sosnovyy Bor for all sorts 
of reasons see nothing bad about this. 
  A delegation from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was 
here recently. In an interview he gave to me, Commission 
Chairman Ayven Selin [name as transliterated] noted that 
Leningrad AES has a high reputation in the world's nuclear power 
industry, and that U.S. colleagues are well apprised of the 
results of station checks carried out by foreign experts. 
  On 21 December the station will celebrate 20 years since its 
first 1-million kilowatt reactor was brought on line. This 
means that the station has already done two-thirds of the 
``distance''--its design life lasts until the year 2003. But we 
must not put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today. 
Now is the time to think about replacement power for a region 
of such industrial importance as the Russian northwest. 
  Together with the Leningrad AES collective, the city and 
oblast authorities have acted completely democratically and 
thoughtfully. An international ``Energy'' competition was held 
in St. Petersburg at which designs for the best reactors in 
terms of technical, economic, and environmental features were 
selected. 
  Authoritative bodies will decide what will replace the 
existing nuclear power installations at Sosnovyy Bor. But this 
decision needs to be speeded up. It takes at least seven or 
eight years to construct a single reactor unit, and designs have 
to be formulated and translated into blueprints. In order to 
gain time, Leningrad AES and its associates, which had the 
biggest input in the construction of the station 20 years ago, 
have resurrected the ``Union of 18.'' This includes such 
enterprises as the Kirovskiy Zavod and Izhorskiy Zavod 
production associations, the ``Leningrad Metallic,'' 
``Elektrosila,'' ``Elektroapparat,'' ``Elektropult,'' and 
``Obukhovskiy'' combines, the VNIIPIET, the AES All-Union 
Scientific Research Institute, NIKIET, and planning and design 
collectives. 
  ``But in order for our plans to become reality,'' Leningrad 
AES chief accountant Aleksandr Loginov believes, ``We would like 
to receive payment in full for our electricity from the Russian 
stock-company `YeES of Russia.' This Russian joint-stock 
company, and particularly its central control administration, is 
abusing our patience.''

  [Text] We have been told by the naval press service that 
three rods used in nuclear reactors on submarines were stolen 27 
November from a strategic depot of the Northern Fleet outside 
Murmansk. These were spent nuclear fuel components which were 
being stored in special containers. An inquiry is under way. 
Unfortunately, neither the command nor naval experts have 
commented on this. 
  The navy has failed to deal with the issue of building new 
nuclear waste stores for decades, and the existng stores are 
already more than full. Nobody in the navy conceals this 
problem, but the navy is unable to deal with it successfully by 
itself. 
  This is what our correspondent Vladimir Makarovich was told 
by Rear-Admiral (Nikolay Irasov), admiral-inspector and head of 
the nuclear safety inspectorate for nuclear installations of 
Russia's Ministry of Defense: 
  [Begin recording] Irasov: The main 
problem is the removal of spent nuclear fuel, because all the 
spent nuclear fuel stores are virtually crammed full. Stores 
for fresh nuclear fuel do not meet nuclear safety requirements 
and there is the problem of ships taken out of combat service, 
that is, the unloading of active areas. 
  Makarovich: What are the implications of not 
resolving these matters, not only for the navy, but for the 
ecological situation in this region? 
  Irasov: There are serious implications, 
radio-ecological ones, because ships which are left for a long 
time with radioactive areas not removed could sink. [end

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Bakina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow December 10 TASS -- The ``Kurchatov 
Institute'' Russian scientific center has accomplished a draft 
of a new system of control over nuclear materials, Academician 
Nikolay Ponomarev-Stepnoy, vice-president of the center, told a 
news conference here today. 
  ``The law enforcement bodies of Russia have registered some 
cases of misappropriations of atomic materials lately,'' the 
researcher said. ``Although no such facts have been recorded 
directly at the `Kurchatov Institute,' the situation is very 
dangerous. We consider it necessary to strengthen control over 
nuclear materials, and a new draft of the control system has 
been worked out exactly for this purpose,'' the academician 
noted. 
  According to Aleksandr Rumyantsev, one of the main think 
tanks of the draft system, at present control over nuclear 
materials is based on data from the institute's accounts 
department. In the future the emphasis will be made on the 
results of physical measurements of materials which will allow 
to know a specific situation practically every week. At the 
same time the administration of the scientific center intends to 
take stock of nuclear products on a regular basis. 
  The draft of a new control system has been prepared together 
with specialists from the American Technical Institute (U.S.A.). 
Researchers from the ``Kurchatov Institute'' find it rather 
important that for the first time the Russian state scientific 
center has been closely cooperating with the U.S. private 
scientific establishment.

  [Excerpt] The Novovoronezh nuclear plant is close to being 
partially or completely shut down. It is one of nine plants 
providing lighting and heating for Russia. Its contribution to 
the country's power system is 12 percent. In the central and 
black earth region the Novovoronezh plant provides 75 percent of 
the power needed by the region. Systematic nonpayments by 
consumers are the reason for the possible shutdown: the 
nonpayments slow down the reconstruction and modernization of 
the station's power sets. There are not sufficient funds to 
improve safety guarantees. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Solomenko report: ``No Nuclear Criminals </F>
Discovered in Kaliningrad''] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- Two articles that have appeared 
recently in the Russian press have the potential to sow panic 
among the populations of a number of countries and cause a major 
international furor. They present their readers with a 
``megatonne'' sensation: A breakdown situation has developed at 
five nuclear weapons storage facilities located on Russia's 
western border near Kaliningrad. These items also reported 
another rather sinister episode: Apparently, the chief engineer 
at the Ignalina Nuclear Electric Power Station ``was caught 
introducing a virus that he had developed himself into the 
computer that regulates the station's work; his intention was to 
knock out the security system.'' 
  Moreover, this staggering information came from a fully 
competent official source--Dmitriy Sorokin, chief of the Russian 
Gosatomnadzor [Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety] North European District Inspectorate--who, it is 
alleged, had just carried out an inquiry into defense storage 
facilities off his own bat. These articles, which quoted the 
ECO DEFENCE INFORM information bulletin published in 
Kaliningrad, were published by the SEA digest. 
  More than anyone else, the people who were most shocked by 
these sensational reports were...the actual staff of 
Gosatomnadzor's North European District. 
  A special investigation was commissioned by the district 
leadership. It showed that the clamorous ``facts'' cited in the 
interview were actually arrant nonsense. It turned out that 
Dmitriy Sorokin had of course not inspected the local military 
storage facilities. And he had basically not made any 
statements to the press. 
  Who would have benefited by organizing such a provocative 
hoax? Here is the view of Yuriy Khripunov, chief public 
relations specialist with Gosatomnadzor's North European 
District: 
  ``The information (or, to be more precise, disinformation) 
fed to the correspondent was given out by a man impersonating 
Sorokin. We have `figured out' this impostor. To be more 
precise, he is a businessman from Kaliningrad who in exchange 
for good money would take radiation pollution measurements of 
dacha plots and market goods without having appropriate 
permission to do so, without possessing a specially certified 
apparatus, and without having the slightest professional 
knowledge in the field of radiation monitoring. Sorokin had 
unmasked this enterprising shyster and brought his illegal 
`business' to a halt. Whereupon the latter clearly decided to 
take revenge on the chief of the inspectorate in such an elegant 
manner.'' 
  But it is still too early to close the file on this story 
for 
another reason. Even having exposed this scandalous 
disinformation, Gosatomnadzor finds itself unable to calm public 
opinion. Because Gosatomnadzor itself does not know the real 
state of our nuclear defense storage facilities, are they not 
fraught with the danger of full-blown accidents? Unfortunately, 
nobody knows whether this is true except the military themselves 
who are religiously keeping their military-departmental secret 
and do not allow Gosatomnadzor inspectors into their 
installations. 
  Meanwhile, back on 5 June 1992, the Russian president 
approved the Statute on Gosatomnadzor: ``Gosatomnadzor...makes 
decisions within the limits of its competence which are binding 
for...military units stationed on Russian Federation 
territory....'' 
  And on 9 April 1993 a new presidential directive was 
published. It states the task even more specifically: ``Before 
1 December 1993 Russian Gosatomnadzor is to investigate 
enterprises, organizations, and military units...under the 
Russian Ministry of Defense in order to check the maintenance of 
nuclear and radiation safety.'' 
  But neither the first nor the second directive from the 
state's highest executive officer was implemented.

<F P=106> [Report by O. Novak: ``Chernobyl Threatens With New </F>
Punishments''] 
  [Text] I remember warnings voiced in 1986, following the 
accident on the fourth block of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant. Scientists predicted that its consequences will be felt 
long after the catastrophe. However, these opinions were 
withheld from the press by censors, and any forecasts that did 
not match the official standpoint were deemed as a provocation 
and panicking. Further events proved that official declarations 
were a pack of lies that caused suffering to many innocent 
people. This is why today, everything that concerns the 
Chernobyl accident is not being rejected without looking into it 
with maximum attention. This is not being done for the sake of 
scaring anybody, but for the sake of protecting the health and 
lives of the living and future generations. 
  These opinions belong to Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet Chernobyl Committee chairman and were expressed 
at a news conference devoted to the revelation by Russian Doctor 
of Geology V. Kopeykin. The latter spent seven years conducting 
tests at the contaminated zone around Chernobyl. Speaking at 
the news conference, Professor Kopeykin, in particular pointed 
out that enhanced activity of certain radionuclides have been 
observed since the accident. In his opinion, previous forecasts 
regarding the dissolution of the radioactive fallout were 
erroneous. Thus, it was believed that plutonium would be 
discovered there within 10 to 14 years after the accident, but 
it appeared in 1987, in subterranean waters in the vicinity of 
the ``red forest'' where nuclear waste was buried. By the way, 
even then, official sources did not reveal the whole truth, and 
there were claims that only 3 percent of the plutonium had been 
emitted into the environment. According to V. Kopeykin, the 
content of the hazardous component was no less than 30 percent. 
Professor Kopeykin believes that those forecasts did not take 
into account the laws of the geochemical migration of 
radionuclides. According to his calculations, the area 
contaminated with plutonium is about 100 square kilometers. 
Other hazardous elements, including americium-241 and 
icyrium-241 [as published], whose period of disintegration 
reaches hundreds of years, were found in the area too. These 
elements are particularly dangerous to the human liver. The 
mentioned radionuclides were discovered not only in subterranean 
waters, but also in cuts of pines, birches, and apple-trees 
growing in the zone. 
  It is surprising that the scientist's research has received 
no attention from the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The 
Academy disregarded the official invitation and did not send its 
representatives to the news conference. 
  Concluding the conference, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy emphasized 
that problems connected with overcoming the aftermath of the 
Chernobyl accident must be resolved jointly by Ukraine, Russia, 
Belarus, and the entire European community.

  [Text] Kiev, 9 December -- In its bulletin of 8 December 
1993, carrying a report entitled ``Ukraine Satisfied With 
Retargeting Missiles,'' the private English-speaking news agency 
Intelnews quotes the director of the press center of the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry, Ihor Melnychenko, as saying that ``a 
group of scientists is working on breaking the codes of 
Ukrainian missiles. If we get these codes, we shall then be 
able to retarget the missiles.'' 
  The press service of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry has 
officially denied this report and stated that no such data has 
been provided for the Intelnews agency by representatives of the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Ukraine exercises administrative 
control over nuclear weapons and is taking steps to prevent the 
use of them. 
  The Defense Ministry press service's report points out that 
the establishment of the press service does not have such a post 
as the director and that the service does not employ a member of 
staff with such a name as Melnychenko.

  [Text] Colonel Valeriy Izmalkov, member of the legislative 
commission for defense and state security, described as 
absolutely ungrounded reports published by THE WASHINGTON POST 
that Ukraine will soon decipher the operational codes of nuclear 
missiles stationed on its territory. The newspaper cited U.S. 
and Russian analysts. Valeriy Izmalkov stated that the nuclear 
missile operational codes have a protection system that makes it 
practically impossible to decipher. He underlined that the 
missiles are launched based on space photographs and not 
geographical maps. So retargeting the missiles would require 
extremely complex calculations--something that only U.S. and 
Russian general staffs are capable of doing. Ukraine is not 
prepared for this. The deputy called the allegations about 
Ukraine deciphering nuclear codes a small link in a big chain of 
provocations against Ukraine. In this connection, Izmalkov also 
mentioned energetic actions by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev 
in Brussels, who resorted to aggressive pressure against Ukraine 
and encouraged other states to do the same.

  [Text] Kiev December 14 TASS -- A team of IAEA experts 
headed by Deputy IAEA General Director Morris Rosen has spent 
two days at the Chernobyl power plant. 
  Rosen told UKRINFORM they came to the plant as the 
international community is concerned with its work, including 
the functioning of the fourth power unit under sarcophagus. 
Another reason is international assistance to Chernobyl. In 
his words, the team was given all information about the plant 
operation. 
  Asked about the IAEA attitude to the on-going operation of 
RBMK reactors at Russian and Lithuanian nuclear power plants, 
Rosen said there is certain concern. However, they know about 
the situation at plants with RBMK reactors and did not have 
enough information about Chernobyl after the Ukrainian 
parliament decided to halt the plant. 
  ``We are interested in enhanced safety of the Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant and in giving the international public 
objective information on its current state. In February a new 
IAEA team will come to the plant to fully estimate the 
situation,'' Chernobyl nuclear power plant's general director 
Nikolay Sorokin told UKRINFORM.

  [Text] Speaking at a briefing for Ukrainian and foreign 
reporters on 21 December, Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Borys Tarasyuk, chairman of the national Committee for 
Disarmament, said: The Ukrainian Government adheres to 
international norms, principles, and standards, and observes all 
sanctions imposed by the United Nations in the issues of arms 
trade. Ukraine does not sell arms to either the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, the South African Republic, or Iraq. 
With regard to selling certain types of arms to Iran, Ukraine 
is pursuing its own economic interests and observes security 
principles. Borys Tarasyuk underlined that Ukraine had never 
sold sea-launched guided missiles to Iran. According to the 
Ukrainian diplomat, taking advantage of the imperfection of the 
system of control exercised by the Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Exports Controls, middlemen manage to ship arms, 
products, and technologies to the states under ban.

<F P=106> [By Paola Messana] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kiev, Dec 14 (AFP) -- Ukraine said it might ask 
Russia to hand over the codes for the nuclear weapons stationed 
on its territory following the success by ultra-nationalist 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in parliamentary polls Sunday, a 
senior parliamentary official said Tuesday [14 December]. 
  Igor Dirkatck, an influential member of the Parliamentary 
Defence Committee, told AFP that Ukraine ``must seek to obtain 
the codes enabling it to control the nuclear missiles stationed 
on its territory to meet the threat to its security represented 
by Zhirinovskiy.'' 
  ``Zhirinovskiy and the Communist Party want to restore the 
Soviet empire and bring Russia back to its pre-1917 frontiers,'' 
he charged. 
  Ukraine possesses 130 strategic SS-19 multiple-warhead 
missiles, mostly obsolete according to experts, along with 46 
modern SS-24 missiles. 
  Though declaring its long-term intention to become a 
non-nuclear state, ratifying the START-I treaty on nuclear 
disarmament signed in July 1991 by the United States and the 
Soviet Union, it has so far refused to give up the SS-24s. 
  Ukrainian leaders have said previously that they could 
obtain 
the nuclear codes ``but had no wish to.'' [passage omitted] 
  Earlier, parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman Dmitri 
Pavlichko said that Sunday's vote showed Russia was ``far from 
being a democracy'' and that Ukraine was right in hesitating to 
give up its nuclear arsenal. 
  ``I hope that after these elections the (international) 
community will better understand Ukraine's positions with regard 
to disarmanent.'' The Russians have ``shown their 
irresponsibility,'' he commented. 
  And Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk said he 
was concerned over the vote by sailors of the Black Sea fleet 
who voted 19 percent in favour of Zhirinovskiy's party compared 
with 11.5 percent for Russia's Choice, the party headed by 
Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar and which strongly backs 
President Boris Yeltsin and his reform program. 
  ``That must push us on to resolving the question of sharing 
out this fleet between Ukraine and Russia,'' he said. ``The 
forces who voted for Zhirinovskiy are on our territory.''

Vitaliy Radetskyy, minister of defense, has visited units and 
facilities of the strategic missile troops deployed on the 
territory of our state. The existing problems have been 
thoroughly analyzed with scientists and specialists during these 
trips. As a result specific measures have been implemented in 
the localities to create a reliable system of control over the 
state of the missile facilities. By a decision of the minister 
of defense, their protection has been increased, for which 
additional subunits and units have been allocated and 
cooperation between them has been established. A great deal of 
attention has also been paid to issues of efficiency and 
technical means, and to the daily life of servicemen and members 
of their families.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Shunevich: ``Americium Is not as Black </F>
as It's Painted''] 
  [Text] Reports disseminated by Russian scientist B. 
Kopeykin and domestic and foreign media, claiming that 
americium-241, which was discovered after the Chernobyl 
breakdown, is far more dangerous than cesium, strontium, and 
plutonium, were the reasons behind a press conference held 
recently at the Ministry for Chernobyl Issues. The reports also 
indicated that measures applied after the Chernobyl catastrophe 
should be reexamined, including the possibility of evacuating 
certain districts of Kiev. 
  In the opinion of B. Prister, first deputy minister for 
Chernobyl issues, who headed the press conference, as well as of 
other Ukrainian specialists and scientists, the reports on the 
americium threat are groundless. Studies have shown that the 
volume of this element--which was discovered in 1944--does not 
exceed previous readings. Compared with cesium, strontium, or 
plutonium, its contribution to the radioactive pollution is 
insignificant, however, whereas the radioactivity of cesium and 
strontium will be gradually decreasing, the radioactivity of 
americium and other elements will increase. Nevertheless, 
according to our scientists, even when the maximum radiation 
level of americium is reached, which will be by the year 2050, 
its concentration in the Dnepr river will be so low, that this 
will be an exclusively scientific problem.

<F P=106> [Commentary by UNIAN correspondent Volodymyr Ivakhnenko: </F>
``A `Missile War' Without Shooting''] 
  [Text] It is expected that, starting from January 1994, 
gas chambers in nuclear reactors of liquid-propellant strategic 
missiles known as SS-19 will gradually become unserviceable. 
After the Ukrainian Parliament ratified, with reservations, 
START-1, Russian specialists, in fact, refused to provide 
technical maintenance of SS-19 warheads, including the supply of 
hydrogen absorbers. 
  The Ukrainian leadership has been driven into a corner. The 
West and Russia continue putting pressure upon Ukraine, 
demanding that it become a nuclear-free state as soon as 
possible and unconditionally. Time works against Ukraine. As is 
known, after a certain period of storage, missile warheads 
become dangerously explosive and are not subject to dismantling. 
This is perfectly well understood in Russia. However, in the 
Kremlin, an openly temporizing position has been taken, until 
the condition of the SS-19's approaches critical. Then, Moscow 
will be able to count upon Ukrainian missiles without any 
compensation. Accordingly, Russia will be able to dictate its 
own terms: Either it accepts all missiles (together with solid- 
propellant SS-24) or none. 
  Kiev is definitely lacking the initiative. It could, for 
example, make a good-will gesture by offering Moscow some of the 
SS- 19 warheads in exchange for fuel for nuclear reactors. 
  In this situation, there remains, perhaps, a last step that 
Kiev could take. Without waiting for assistance from Moscow, it 
may hand over to Washington (or to some other interested party, 
for example, China) the right to the dismantled 
liquid-propellant missiles, after receiving guarantees and 
monetary compensation. This will not be at variance with the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, if we deal with members of the 
``nuclear club.'' (The treaty bans such actions only with 
regard to nonnuclear states). In such a case, Moscow would see 
that the problem may also be resolved without it. In turn, the 
Pentagon would get a unique chance to study Soviet missile 
technology. This step is inadmissible from the point of view of 
Russian security. However, to all appearances, only in this way 
the Kremlin politicians may become more compliant with regard to 
compensation and assistance. 
  Even though, theoretically, this is a perfectly possible 
development of events, there arise many practical questions in 
the ``American'' variant.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev December 16 TASS -- The press release 
circulated here on Thursday [16 December] described as not 
conforming to reality the reports by some mass media about the 
critical condition of nuclear facilities on Ukrainian territory. 
The press release was issued following an inspection tour of 
units and facilities of the strategic missile forces by 
Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy accompanied by 
officials responsible for the maintenance of nuclear facilities. 
On a commission from the Ukrainian president, they visited 
depots for temporary storage of nuclear warheads removed from 
missiles to assess their condition. 
  ``There actually are certain maintenance problems,'' said 
Vladimir Mityuk, commander of the 43th Army of the strategic 
missile forces, who took part in the trip. ``And this is quite 
explicable. But there are no grounds to lay it on thick. The 
situation on nuclear facilities is fully under control, and we 
have all necessary means and resources for this. Any attempts 
at drawing an analogy to Chernobyl or anything of the kind is 
absolutely inadmissible,'' he stressed. 
  According to Valeriy Vasilyev, commander of Ukraine's 
strategic air forces, the nuclear ammunition is presently 
``preserved reliably.'' Although the air forces also face 
certain problems, the situation is still far from critical. 
Such assertions do not conform to reality, he noted. 
  The press release quotes Radetskyy as saying a package of 
documents has been prepared for discussion at the proposed 
meeting with the Russian defence minister. The main thing, he 
believes, is the mutual desire of the two sides ``to find a 
constructive solution to all existing problems.'' 
  The press release assesses the present state of Ukrainian 
nuclear facilities as satisfactory. Additional measures are 
being taken ``to maintain nuclear warheads in proper conditions 
and to provide strategic troops with all necessary things.''

  [Text] Kiev, 13 Dec -- Ukrainian Peasants Democratic Party 
[USDP] cochairman Serhiy Plachynda said: ``As we expected, 
communist fascism in Russia is winning. It is subsidized by 
both world Zionism and chauvinist circles. Those who may come 
to power in Russia will pursue a policy which will be very 
dangerous for Ukraine. It is now becoming clear that the public 
should reach the conclusion that we must not disarm. Nuclear 
missiles are a guarantor of peace not only in Ukraine but 
throughout the world. Zhirinovskiy will be at war with Ukraine 
the moment the last ballistic missile equipped with a nuclear 
warhead is removed from Ukrainian territory. It is a great 
danger to Ukraine that President Kravchuk does not realize that 
nuclear weapons are a guarantor of statehood and security. Our 
government and structures of power are operating a pro-Moscow 
policy: Even now Ukraine is buying goods from Russia paying six 
times as much [as we should] and selling them for eight times 
less [than we should]. Ukraine's budget is plummeting and all 
that is aggravated by such a dangerous force appearing as 
Russian communist fascism. So the USDP position is that, as a 
nuclear state, we can only carry out nuclear disarmament when it 
is adequately matched by other nuclear states' disarmament.''

<F P=106> [Report by Zhozef Shapoval: ``Improvement of Nuclear Power </F>
Plants' Security Will Be Handled Jointly''] 
  [Text] Elements of the market economy are persistently 
penetrating the sphere of nuclear power engineering, which has 
been inaccessible so far. Recently in Ukraine, the first 
Ukrainian-German joint venture UNA has been established in this 
area. Among its founders were the Rivne nuclear power plant, 
the Kiev Institute Enerhoproekt, and the German joint stock 
company KAB. 
  German nuclear power engineers have great experience in 
constructing nuclear power stations and improving their 
security. The new joint venture company will reinforce hermetic 
containers of the first and second power units at the Rivne 
nuclear power plant. Experts have recommended installation of a 
pass for polluted metal in a special smelting furnace. Also 
preliminary inspection of containers has already been conducted.

  [Text] The information center of the Zaporozhye AES 
reported that the first generating set went temporarily out of 
order last night. It was deactivated by the emergency shutdown 
system because of a fault in the water make-up unit in one of 
the turbine generators. The reactor plant capacity thus became 
ineffective. The fault was quickly rectified, and the generating 
set was switched on again. At the same time, the information 
center reports, the civil defense alarm sounded while the 
technical staff was being informed of the incident. The cause 
of the alarm is being investigated. The incident at the AES 
poses no danger to the safety of its personnel or the 
population. Background radiation remains within the norm.

<F P=106> [Report by Candidate of Technical Sciences Anatoliy </F>
Kovalevskyy: ``Is the Explosion of the `Sarcophagus' 
Inevitable?''] 
  [Text] I will start by reiterating commonly known facts. 
The Chernobyl catastrophe was preceded by a similar accident in 
Chelyabinsk Oblast Kyshtym where the Soviet atomic bomb was 
being constructed. Radioactive waste was dumped in a lake near 
the town, and that caused an explosion. 
  Has anybody ever analyzed why this happened? 
  I spent many years working at the Ukrainian Academy of 
Sciences Institute of Electrodynamics and I am an expert in the 
field of thermodiffusion. 
  The fourth block ``sarcophagus'' consists of nuclear fuel 
residue covered with a thick layer of concrete. All in all, 
about 1,000 tonnes of uranium and plutonium are stored at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant [AES], including fuel for 
operating reactors and radioactive waste. Without going into 
detail, I want to say that on 30 December 1992, I came to the 
conclusion that a terrible thermonuclear explosion is inevitable 
at the fourth block. The explosion will totally destroy Ukraine 
and a larger part of Europe. 
  I came to this conclusion after analyzing thermodiffusion 
processes recently discovered by me and still unknown to the 
public. The essence of the discovery is this: Plutonium that is 
a component of the solid radioactive alloy of the fourth reactor 
(both earlier produced and the new one created by the 
disintegration of uranium), influenced by the heat emitted in 
the course of the process, is moving very slowly to certain 
points of the block and is accumulating at these points. 
  As a result of this diffusion process, the amount of 
plutonium in one of these points may exceed the critical mass 
and lead to a nuclear explosion. It is impossible to reverse 
this process. I am assured that the explosion at the nuclear 
dump near Chelyabinsk was caused by the same factors, although a 
much smaller amount of uranium was involved. 
  I think that Japanese thermodiffusionists can confirm my 
conclusions. These people are working on creating extra-large 
integrated microchips, and are currently the most qualified 
experts in the field of thermodiffusion in the world. 
  I did not calculate the possible date of a new explosion at 
Chernobyl AES. However, I want to emphasize once again that an 
explosion is inevitable. There is no chance to avoid a 
catastrophe. 
  However, I believe that a solution can be found if we do not 
waste time. No new ``sarcophagus'' should be constructed. The 
``green meadow'' version must be urgently implemented at the 
AES. This is the only way to avoid a disaster. I have drafted 
a number of technical measures regarding this version. 
  Unfortunately, my appeals to high officials in Ukraine 
brought only a partial result -- the version was accepted but it 
will be carried out within a five year period. The process for 
plutonium to exceed the critical mass will hardly wait that long. 
  I have turned to the press to attract public attention to 
this issue and demand its expeditious resolution. Time will not 
wait!

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Boyon, former minister and president of </F>
the National Defense and Armed Forces Commission of France's 
National Assembly: ``France's and Europe's Reaction to New 
American Defense Industry Policy''] 
  [Excerpts] Concerned by recent developments in the defense 
industry, which is suffering from the drop in and staggering of 
programs for the armed forces, keen U.S. competition on 
shrinking export markets, and difficulties in European 
cooperation, the National Assembly's Defense Commission visited 
the United States from 12 to 17 September. (The delegation was 
headed by Defense Commission President Boyon and included Daniel 
Colin, Dominique Dupilet, Pierre Favre, Rene Galy-Dejean, and 
Patrice Martin-Lalande.) They discussed the outlook for the 
American arms industry with the new Administration, industry, 
members of Congress, top Pentagon officials, and consultants. 
[passage omitted summarizing U.S. defense policy] 
  All of these new orientations are clearly and precisely set 
out in a document entitled ``Bottom Up Review,'' which should be 
taken into consideration by those responsible in France. What 
conclusions can be drawn for our own industrial policies? 
<H5>  Research and Development </H5>
  Research and development must be given solid support to 
maintain our skills base and know-how both at the level of 
researchers and production teams. There has been a tendency 
over the past few years to ask manufacturers to finance an 
increasing part of research themselves to alleviate government 
costs. If our main competitor is financing research from the 
taxpayers' money, France should do the same. Failing this, 
i.e., if our export products also have to integrate research 
costs, they will no longer be competitive and our overall 
research effort will become increasingly insufficient. However, 
the government must draw up a program and industry must reduce 
the size and number of its research centers. There are 
certainly too many of them and they lack coherence in their 
activities. 
<H5>  Subcontracting </H5>
  Subcontracting must be given stronger support. The quality 
of our arms industry is based not only on the excellence of its 
major armaments, systems, and equipment manufacturers, but also 
on the existence of a dense fabric of small- and even 
medium-sized companies which have a proven capacity for 
innovative products, materials, and techniques. A drive has 
been launched to remove the reluctance of large companies to 
farm out research, but this drive need be reinforced. 
<H5>  Exports </H5>
  The government should give priority to exportable arms and 
equipment in its programming. Programs which are 
technologically or industrially advanced in relation to their 
competitors should not be staggered. We know that France only 
exports arms used by its own forces and tested under real 
conditions. We should avoid delays in transferring weapons 
systems to units when they are expected to make a rapid 
breakthrough on foreign markets. Here again, we have to resist 
the temptation to delay such programs because of their potential 
to put us ahead of competitors. On the contrary, this potential 
should be strengthened. The Rafale fighter aircraft is a good 
example of this, but there are others. 
<H5>  Cooperation </H5>
  Finally and above all, our objectives in terms of 
cooperation 
should be redefined. This was the focus of all our talks, and 
our American counterparts were no exception. Everyone is, in 
theory, favorable to this cooperation. 
  However, as soon as we tried to go deeper in our talks, we 
were cut short by our counterparts. However, the idea of 
French-American or Euro-American cooperation was is being 
considered by the Pentagon, which, more than ever, is aware of 
budgetary constraints and realizes that cooperation would reduce 
cost prices and enable armies to buy more for less. 
  In Congress, however, despite the good intentions of Senator 
Nunn, president of the Senate's Armed Forces Commission, or in 
the Administration, the idea of cooperation still remains 
somewhat abstract. Nearly all cooperation projects between 
France and the United States, and there were many of them at the 
beginning, never got beyond the phase of exchanging expertise 
and information. In the initial stages of research and 
development, they rarely got beyond the ``R'' stage and turned 
turtle on the ``D.'' The RITA [Integrated Automatic 
Transmission Network] case is the only exception. 
  However, we must continue to believe in it, but we may not 
put all our eggs in one basket, because France can try to 
cooperate directly with the United States, but also with Europe. 
  Direct cooperation with the United States is desirable in 
cases where Americans themselves say they are open to it and 
where Europeans seem unmotivated, unskilled, or where it is too 
small in scale compared to the United States. This is the case 
in the area of antimissile systems, which was the only area for 
which the various people we met made cooperation proposals. 
France will undoubtedly need to brace itself for this 
cooperation with the United States, and it should do so 
vigorously both at the industrial and political levels because 
there will be strong misgivings on the other side of the 
Atlantic. 
<H5>  European Strategy </H5>
  In other fields, European cooperation should be relaunched 
while there is still time. We have a maximum of two to three 
years ahead of us to succeed because, after this period, there 
will only be one or two U.S. suppliers left to contend with and, 
considering the respective sizes of the American and European 
markets, Europe will only survive competition if it has a single 
supplier for each major category of material and equipment. 
  There is an urgent need to emerge from this period of 
hesitation currently marking Europe. Our country has without a 
doubt a specific responsibility to raise the awareness of the 
highest European political authorities of this need and urgency. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Finally, the American Administration's determination, which 
is stronger than ever, to support the defense industry on export 
markets must also be taken into account. We have seen that a 
simple personal telephone call from the President to a head of 
state can carry considerable weight and provide effective 
assistance in penetrating markets. Even if this is not part of 
the French Government's tradition, it should face facts and 
learn to use this strategy surreptitiously. The exchanges of 
view the National Assembly's Defense Commission managed to have 
with different American officials lead to the conclusion that 
more than ever, France's defense industry must not be considered 
as a mere supplier for its own army. It holds and must continue 
to hold an important position both in France's economic and 
international strategy.

<F P=106> [Article by Jerome Thorel: ``To Forget Mururoa, Is It </F>
Possible To Simulate a Nuclear Explosion?''] 
  [Text] The fate of nuclear testing is currently being 
discussed around microscopic silica and polymer capsules. 
Attempts are being made to reproduce the phenomenon of 
controlled fusion in pellets filled with a gas similar to 
hydrogen. The current moratorium on nuclear testing--with the 
possibility of a total ban treaty--has led the major powers to 
begin vast simulation research programs. The final goal is to be 
able to begin a real process of ``virtual dissuasion'' and to 
design thermonuclear weapons without the need for a full scale 
testing stage. 
  For the experts in the Atomic Energy Commission's (CEA) 
Military Applications Department (DAM), a nuclear test is 
already a simulation--a real simulation. In an interview with 
SCIENCES ET AVENIR, DAM Chief Roger Baleras insisted that 
``performing a test is not the same as designing a weapon.'' Of 
course, the testing is done to ``qualify'' a weapon, but it is 
also a way for us to check our propositions in physics. A test 
serves to validate the theoretical laws of basic physics. 
Encyclopedic manuals tell us that there are mathematical models 
that can simulate every basic aspect of an explosion (equations 
of state, hydrodynamics, neutron transport, and radiation 
transfer). 
  Running on supercomputers, these models become numerical 
codes that make it possible to follow the thermodynamics of the 
system (pressure, density, temperatures, etc.), finally giving 
the energy balances and the effects of nuclear reactions. To 
ensure that the physical laws are correct, the codes must be 
supplied and validated using experimental data--obtained from 
nuclear testing. The current challenge is to validate these 
numerical codes with supercomputers rather than nuclear tests. 
There are two main categories of test: Safety and reliability 
tests related directly to designing new weapons and maintaining 
the existing stockpile; and tests to calculate the destructive 
effects of the atomic charges. 
  Of the four ``recognized'' atomic powers, only the United 
States and France have an advanced simulation program. In 
France, the simulation program started in 1991 by the DAM was 
christened PALEN (Preparation for the Limitation of Nuclear 
Testing). The brain center for the operation was the 
Limeil-Valenton research facility, to the east of Paris. In the 
United States, where simulation work has been underway for a 
much longer time, the current AGEX (Above Ground Experiments) 
program draws its impetus from the fact that the three national 
nuclear research centers are competing with each other (Lawrence 
Livermore in California, and Los Alamos and Sandia in New 
Mexico). These programs are highly confidential. However, in 
this sea of ``classified'' data, the calmer waters of civil 
research into ``controlled fusion'' gives a slightly clearer 
view. 
  For the military physicists, the basic problem--reproducing 
in the laboratory the temperature, density, and radiation 
conditions in the confined area inside a nuclear weapon--ties in 
with the civil race to ``harvest'' the energy produced by the 
fusion of hydrogen or its isotopes. In both cases an energy 
gain is sought: The energy released must be greater than the 
energy consumed by the reaction. In the civil domain, this gain 
is converted into electricity, while in the military domain it 
is converted into physical data. Simulation is only worthwhile 
if the phenomenon can be measured (if there is an ``outgoing 
radiation''), or in other words, if the energy released is 
greater than the original energy. 
  This is the problem for fusion reactions. The principle 
comes down to switching from an environment of light atoms to 
heavier elements. This creates a mass defect which is at the 
source of energy. The most efficient type of reaction consists 
of fusing the nuclei of deuterium and tritium (hydrogen 
isotopes). The neutron and nucleus of helium (an alpha 
particle) carry kinetic energy equivalent to 350 MJ (megajoules) 
per gram of deuterium-tritium mixture, i.e., as much energy as 
would be generated from the combustion of 10,000 liters of crude 
oil. In a thermonuclear bomb, this same gramme of 
deuterium-tritium releases energy equivalent to 20 tonnes of 
TNT. Nuclear physics has its limitations, however. Notably, 
this type of fusion requires temperatures in the region of 50 
million degrees Celsius. In these conditions, the matter is in 
a plasmic state, meaning that the ions and electrons are 
dissociated. The reason for such high temperatures is that 
positive ions increasingly repel each other the closer they are 
together. To fuse them they have to impact at high speed, and 
it is this collision which generates the very high temperatures. 
  How is this plasmic state of matter obtained? In a 
thermonuclear bomb, the fusion of deuterium and tritium is 
obtained by a fission reaction, with a mini A-bomb sparking the 
combustion. To simulate this type of explosion in the 
laboratory, another source of heat was required: particle beams 
or lasers (photon beams). In any event, what is needed is a 
fairly intense impulse to heat the matter to its ignition 
temperature. While laser is the most advanced method, we still 
need energy sources a hundred times more powerful than we have 
today to produce a sufficient gain. 
  A French expert states: ``Using very powerful lasers, we can 
reproduce in the laboratory the conditions (temperature, 
density, etc.) similar to those that exist inside nuclear 
weapons. We are simply trying to validate the numerical codes 
that in the past we checked by carrying out real tests.'' The 
Phebus laser used by the DAM at Limeil can generate several 
kilojoules (kJ) of energy. When applied to matter, this gives 
``hot plasmas'' of several dozen million degrees, which is 
enough to recreate the heat conditions inside a thermonuclear 
weapon. 
  It then remains for us to recreate the same conditions of 
density. To do this, laser science is opening the way up to 
``inertial confinement'' fusion (ICF), competing on the civil 
level with magnetic confinement: The Joint European Torus (JET) 
experiments in this area have already been described at length. 
In either case, the plasma has to be kept confined long enough 
for a sufficient number of fusion reactions to occur. 
  The exact use of inertial fusion for simulations remains 
``defense classified.'' Nevertheless, ICF--initially designed 
with military aims in mind--gives researchers an effective way 
of bringing matter in the laboratory to densities comparable 
with those inside a weapon. The DAM claims that there is 
another way to do this. 
  The many parameters needed for good implosion are ensured by 
the type of laser impulse used. Lasting just one nanosecond, 
this impulse is tunable to the point where cold compression of 
the target occurs (this is better for gaseous bodies) while 
creating hot spots (the condition required for ignition). The 
quality of the implosion depends greatly on the beam wavelength. 
In the context of civil thermonuclear fusion research for 
energy production, the work with hot plasma done by the French 
National Scientific Research Center's (CNRS) Laboratory for the 
Use of Intense Lasers (LULI), based in the Polytechnic school at 
Palaiseau, has shown that short wavelengths (0.26 micron and 
0.35 micron) are more efficient for converting laser beam energy 
into plasma heat energy. 
  French and American experts stress, however, that this light 
impulse is not sufficiently uniform to attack or light the 
target: compression must be symmetrical at every point of the 
silica shell. Civil and military experts know that X-rays can 
give a finer degree of uniformity, and this led to the so-called 
``indirect attack'' principle. The light energy is first 
converted into X-ray radiation and it is this that then attacks 
the target. In addition, X-rays have shorter wavelengths than 
lasers (10,000 times shorter). Since they carry more energy 
than the visible rays, X-rays can better penetrate the solid. 
We should note that this is one of the most ``classified'' 
aspects of the simulation debate, with indirect attack touching 
on the same aspects of radiation transfer as inside a weapon. 
In PHYSICS TODAY, John Lindl's team summarized the state of 
official data: ``A laser beam or a particle beam is first 
absorbed in a cavity'' (a complex target, termed an ``empty 
space'') which embodies the capsule. This cavity then emits 
X-rays which attack the capsule until it implodes (...) The 
ablations of a target attacked by X-rays are hydrodynamically 
more stable. No further details are given, of course, on the 
conversion method or the materials used. 
  Nevertheless, at the current time, no laser exists that is 
powerful enough to exceed the famous break-even [preceding word 
in English] point, i.e., capable of releasing more energy than 
it uses. The world's experts agree that what is needed is an 
ICF reactor capable of supplying megajoules of energy. This 
estimation results from the Halite/Centurion experiment carried 
out in the United States in the mid-1980's, in which the X-rays 
produced during a nuclear test were claimed to prove the 
feasibility of ICF by indirect attack. We are still a long way 
off, however: Currently, the largest laser in the world, the 
Nova at the Lawrence Livermore site, is capable of producing 
``only'' 40 kJ. At the same frequency (0.35 micron) and for the 
same impulse time (1 nanosecond) the Phebus laser (American in 
origin) can supply 8 kJ. To arrive at the MJ or ``Upgrade'' 
[preceding word in English] laser, we need to increase power by 
a factor of 100. France and the United States are working 
together in this area to reduce costs by designing other 
amplification methods. 
  Even if laser technology has an uncertain future--the 
Americans claim that heavy ion particle beams (xenon, cesium, 
and bismuth) are better suited for the development of an ICF 
reactor--it still remains the most advanced technology. Thus 
the first stage in the AGEX program will begin with the National 
Ignition Facility (the $400-million successor to the Nova 
laser). This new 1-to-2-MJ laser is expected to be able to 
produce an energy gain of 20-30 MJ...but not before the year 
2002. A recent study showed that this installation will already 
be able to simulate many of the tests examining the effects of 
nuclear weapons. 
  The French PALEN project appears less certain. Military 
experts state: ``There will be no simulation tools if we are 
not allowed to validate them. In other words, we need to 
perform another series of experiments if we are to eliminate the 
need for them.'' The Americans would appear to be some way 
ahead in this area. According to a report issued by the Defense 
Committee of the National Assembly in November, 40 tests have 
already been performed in the United States to validate 
simulation instruments, as opposed to just one in France. The 
same report underlines that at least 10 tests are needed before 
1997 if PALEN is to be developed, but the DAM has refused to 
comment on these figures. This program--which will have a 
budget of 600 million French francs next year--is only a 
preparation for the limitation of testing. A ministerial source 
states that the development of new types of weapons, such as 
those with variable power or triggered electromagnetically, will 
always require real tests, thus rejecting the political 
possibility of a ``Comprehensive Test Ban'' (CTB) on nuclear 
testing. No doubt political decisions will continue to affect 
what is a truly scientific challenge, with those small silica 
capsules acting as the scapegoat.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``While Moratorium Decided by </F>
President Mitterrand Still Stands--Parliamentary Mission 
Considers France Needs About Twenty New Nuclear Tests''] 
  [Text] Members of the parliamentary mission--set up by the 
National Assembly's Defense Commission and chaired by Paris RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] member of Parliament Rene 
Galy-Dejean--on French nuclear testing and the moratorium 
decreed by Francois Mitterrand (which is to stand until the end 
of his term of office, in 1995) handed in their conclusions on 
Wednesday 15 October. According to their report, ``short of 
resuming nuclear testing, France is not assured of being in a 
position to provide itself with a simulation system that 
guarantees absolute mastery over its defense systems, that is, 
over its security and independence.'' About 20 new tests are 
said to be necessary. 
  For the first time in the Fifth Republic, members of 
Parliament have been led to act as investigators in a field--the 
implementation and maintenance of the nuclear 
deterrent--recognized as being the sole preserve of the head of 
state. This is a precedent, although mission members are prompt 
to note that such has long been the case in the United States. 
In France, the report contends, ``the secrecy and 
`overclassification' which surround anything to do with nuclear 
technology, and the extreme scientific and technical complexity 
of military nuclear technology have often combined to obscure 
the approaches followed in this field.'' Mr. Galy-Dejean states 
that it is time the government established a scientific and 
military council open to personalities with differing 
backgrounds, and which would participate in the decisionmaking 
process by giving advice and directions. 
  According to the parliamentary mission, France ``tackled 
belatedly'' the problem of nuclear testing simulation. The 
United States began studies on the matter as early as 1980, 
carrying out about 50 experiments. France only performed one, 
in 1991, out of the 204 tests (including security tests) it 
performed since its first one in 1960 in the Sahara. Another 
experiment had been scheduled for 1992, but Mr. Mitterrand then 
decreed a suspension, which is still standing. 
  Why are experiments needed? According to Mr. Galy-Dejean, 
whose information comes from the Atomic Energy Commission [CEA], 
the purpose of testing is as follows: 
  -- validating fundamental physics concepts as they relate to 
nuclear weapons; 
  -- validating concepts selected for weapon development and 
production; 
  -- checking weapon reliability over time, as aging 
characteristics are difficult to predict with certainty; 
  -- maintaining scientist and researcher know-how; 
  -- enhancing the deterrence effect, by showing the world 
that 
weapons work; 
  -- checking, through safety tests, that a stored weapon does 
not constitute a hazard. 
<H5>  Significant Investments </H5>
  In 1981, France performed on average about 12 tests a year. 
This figure was gradually reduced to five. In 1991, to remedy 
this cut and ``not at all as a measure taken in anticipation of 
a total ban on nuclear testing,'' notes Mr. Galy-Dejean, the 
PALEN (preparation to nuclear testing limitation) program was 
implemented. The goal was twofold: Checking the effectiveness 
and safety of operational weapons, and renewing deterrent 
payloads through nuclear tests involving minimal energy expenses. 
  Significant investments need to be made in computing power 
(some Fr400 million in computers 50 times as powerful as today's 
platforms), in radiographic accelerators (no less than Fr430 
million) and megajoule lasers (Fr6 to 7 billion should France 
not be able to develop such equipment jointly with the United 
States). 
  It is expected that this equipment will not be available 
before the year 1998 or 2002. This is why the parliamentary 
mission states that, according to the experts it has consulted 
with, France needs another 20 or so full-size tests. Ten such 
tests should make it possible to develop PALEN procedures, and 
another 10 are needed to finalize the design of the nuclear 
warheads of the M.5 and ASLP (long-range air-to-ground) missiles 
intended for future strategic submarines as well as the Rafale 
aircraft.

  [Text] Paris, Dec 10 (AFP) -- The French Atomic Energy 
Commission (CEA) announced late Thursday [9 December] that 
France had carried out 192 nuclear tests, saying that previous 
reports of 161 tests were a mistake. 
  The announcement came in response to calls from 
environmentalists Greenpeace to ``lift the secrecy'' surrounding 
the number of French tests. 
  Greenpeace had said it was astonished that official and 
parliamentary figures on the exact number had varied. 
  But the CEA admitted that the figure of 161 it had published 
in a report had been a ``material error'' and that the correct 
figure was 192 as stated in April by CEA director general 
Philippe Rouvillois. 
  It said late Thursday that the number of French tests up to 
a 
moratorium imposed in April 1992 ``was indeed 192.'' 
  The United States this week reported that it had not 
revealed 
some 204 tests.

  [Text] Paris, Dec 20 (AFP) -- France changed its mind 
Monday [20 December] about a complete ban on dumping nuclear 
waste at sea and is to sign the convention drafted in London 
last month, Environment Minister Michel Barnier said. 
  France was among five countries which abstained at the time, 
while 37 nations voted for a total ban on disposing of even weak 
radioactive waste at sea. 
  France has not done such dumping for many years. Barnier 
said in a radio interview that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur 
had decided France should continue to set a good example and 
would sign the convention along with the majority of countries. 
  Other abstainers to date include Britain, Russia and China.

<F P=106> [Olivier Provost report: ``Francois Leotard Revives Issue </F>
of Exocet Successor''] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Francois Leotard has just asked 
his office to plan the successor to the Exocet antiship missile 
for the next decade. This is a huge stake because Exocet, 
produced by Aerospatiale from 1972, has reached sales of 3,000 
missiles, and more than 2,500 exported to 32 countries, bringing 
in orders worth 40 billion francs [Fr]. There is no question of 
the public authorities not taking advantage of this legacy with 
a new missile. But nor is there any question of reviving the 
ANS, the supersonic antiship missile--a product which emerged 
from cooperation between Aerospatiale and the German DASA 
(Deutsche Aerospace). This missile, which was to replace the 
Exocet, was halted in 1992 by the public authorities, which had 
funded part of its development, for budgetary reasons and 
because of a production price which was deemed to be too high. 
  The official departments then asked the industrialists to 
resubmit proposals between now and spring 1994. Three options 
have emerged. First, it is possible to continue to optimize the 
Exocet. The sea-to-sea [MM] 38 type missile of the seventies was 
thus followed by the MM-40 around 1980 and then the MM-40 ``bloc 
2'' for the nineties which, faced with the American Harpoon 
(McDonnell Douglas), won the last six export competitions, 
notably in Malaysia, Oman, the Philippines, and Qatar. But a 
mere modernization of the Exocet would not prevent this subsonic 
missile--it attacks at Mach 0.89, in other words at around 980 
km per hour--from being outclassed in the year 2000 by naval 
defenses. Hence the idea of enabling the Exocet to take a 
technological leap forward, for instance by equipping it with a 
new radar. Dassault Electronique could then offer the automatic 
guidance system of the ANS missile which is ready now. But this 
would not make the Exocet either more rapid or more agile. 
  Aerospatiale is therefore to suggest building a new missile 
but with very much reduced costs and timetable. A new missile 
usually takes 10 to 12 years to develop at a cost of Fr10 
billion. The company could put forward a tender for less than 
Fr2 billion and the product could be ready by the year 2000. It 
would be a supersonic missile--``absolutely vital'' according to 
Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's chairman and chief executive--with 
a speed of around 2,500 km per hour, equipped with the ramjet of 
the medium-range air-to-surface missile--a technology which the 
French alone have mastered in the West. The automatic guidance, 
the military payload (the explosive), and the computer would 
also be readily available. This combination of a naval 
medium-range air-to-surface missile with an ANS--achieved by 
off-the-shelf purchases--would be carried out by Aerospatiale 
and its ally DASA which are planning the rapprochement of their 
tactical missile activities for 1994. The 12 frigates planned by 
France, Britain, and Italy in 2002, those planned by Germany 
with the Netherlands and perhaps Spain by around 2007, and then 
the modernization--halfway through their life--of existing 
European naval armaments already represents a potential market 
of around 1,000 missiles.

<F P=106> [Interview with Framatome Chairman Jean-Claude Leny, by </F>
Elisabeth Rochard; date, place not given: Jean-Claude Leny: 
``We Propose a Joint Venture With Chinese Partners''] 
  [Text] 
  Rochard: You have just returned from China where 
Framatome [Franco-American Atomic Construction Company] is 
completing the construction of two nuclear stages at Daya Bay 
[placename as published]. When is production of electricity 
expected to start? 
  Leny: In fact the first stage has already started 
to produce electricity in the framework of the tests scheduled 
in the contract. It has even operated at 100 percent of its 
power, but it is not contractually finished and it will only be 
taken over by the client in January [1994]. This first stage is 
therefore currently being run experimentally. It has passed the 
most important test, which consists of operating for 100 hours 
at full power, without interruption. The second stage will 
start in the spring, in other words, this summer the nuclear 
power generated on the site will reach almost 2,000 megawatts. 
However, our teams will not all return to France. Indeed, we 
have just signed a maintenance contract which will necessitate 
the presence on the site of around 20 people, which is far from 
the 400 European expatriates that we had at the peak period out 
of a staff of 4,000 people. 
  Rochard: When the contract was signed in 1986, 
constructing a nuclear power station of this size in China must 
have seemed like attempting the impossible? 
  Leny: It has not always been easy. But we had 
considerable experience abroad, because we have constructed 
nuclear power stations in Belgium, in Korea, and in South 
Africa--power stations which break world records for 
uninterrupted operation. The most difficult thing is to 
construct a nuclear power station on the spot with local labor; 
it is not like a plane which would be built in our factories. 
By the transfers of technology made, the Chinese have acquired 
some experience in the nuclear sphere. We think that it would 
be opportune to continue. 
  Rochard: Does China have adequate technology to 
construct a nuclear power station and does it intend to pursue 
its nuclear program? 
  Leny I think that the Chinese still need us to 
construct a large-scale nuclear power station. But they will 
certainly do more on the next power station, and so forth. 
China has very big energy requirements. We were told that by 
all the officials we met, including Prime Minister Li Peng. 
These requirements can be satisfied by coal. But coal is 
difficult to transport and it raises problems of transportation 
within the country. For the southern provinces, nuclear power 
is the best means of producing electricity in quantity and 
cleanly. We have offered to help our Chinese interlocutors to 
build a nuclear industry and to create a joint venture with 
Chinese partners. This joint company would be formed with a 
substantial program. Its role would be to do in China what we 
have done in France. This proposal interests Beijing greatly. 
But there is a political problem to be solved first. It was not 
concealed from me. 
  Rochard: Do you think that the right conditions 
exist for a settlement of the dispute which resulted from the 
supply of Mirage planes to Taiwan? 
  Leny: The prime minister, who received me on a 
private basis, was friendly and he said that he was ready to 
welcome positive gestures which the French Government might make 
with a view to restoring confidence. This confidence reigned, 
he stressed, when we signed our contracts. I had the impression 
of people who were open to reconciliation provided the French 
Government initiated it. I found the atmosphere markedly less 
tense than a year ago but it is up to the French Government to 
take action. Moreover, there is no shortage of opportunities, 
whether it be the official opening of Daya Bay which is due to 
take place in February or March or the 30th anniversary of 
China's recognition by France. But it will take more than a 
symbolic gesture. 
  Rochard: Do you have the impression that the 
Chinese nuclear program is being established and that there will 
be a follow-up to Daya Bay? 
  Leny: China is indeed busy establishing its 
nuclear program with all the hesitations and considerations that 
it involves. For instance, in Guandong province, two sites are 
being envisaged. Which should be started first? The answer has 
not yet been given. The other question is the degree of 
participation by Chinese industries. Some people think that 
China can do everything immediately, others that it still needs 
help. But it is now that the thinking is taking place. It is 
therefore preferable not to waste time if we want to join this 
circuit. 
  Rochard: Is foreign competition fierce? 
  Leny: Of course. The American company 
Westinghouse has just made an official visit to China. The 
Japanese have a strong presence. As for the Germans, we are 
associated with them and the situation is different. In 
Guandong province, where Daya Bay is situated, it is planned 
that it will be Framatome and GEC Alsthom which reply to the 
invitations to tender. On the other hand, everywhere else in 
China, it is NPI [expansion not given], our joint subsidiary 
with Siemens which is operational for the nuclear sector. But I 
still think that we have a good position in view of what we have 
just done. 
  Rochard: Let us return to Europe. Do you think 
that the freeze on the German nuclear program is irreversible? 
Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said last Friday [10 December] 
that, if that was the case, your association with Siemens no 
longer had much sense. 
  Leny: I greatly regret this situation which I do 
not think corresponds to anything rational or reasonable. The 
SPD [Social Democratic Party] and the German Greens have a 
totally unjustifiable position with regard to nuclear power. 
This being the case, Siemens, our partner, which knows the 
hidden forces of its country better than I do, is fairly calm. 
This wait-and-see situation has no effect on our cooperation. 
But we would obviously like the situation to be more dynamic in 
Germany for the sake of our agreement. 
  Rochard: What progress has been made in the plans 
to change your capital leading to Alcatel Alsthom taking control? 
  Leny: I know absolutely nothing about it. We are 
in the position of any company which has shareholders. They are 
free to buy and sell. It is up to the management to adapt to 
that, and to ensure that these changes do not affect the smooth 
running of the enterprise. This is what we are doing. I have 
simply said that, if that was the decision of the public 
authorities, we would ensure that it goes smoothly. We have not 
expressed any wish in either direction. 
  Rochard: Alcatel Alsthom is a serious competitor 
for Siemens. Would a majority share held by Pierre Suard's group 
not be likely to jeopardize your cooperation with your German 
partner? 
  Leny: Do not think that. Big groups can be 
competitors in one or two spheres and be linked in a third. 
This is not contradictory. 
  Rochard: What will Framatome's results be in 1993? 
  Leny: I will stand by the forecasts made. The net 
profit should be slightly less than Fr900 million. But in 1994, 
the turnover should take a leap forward, because we will invoice 
the two Chinese stages in the next financial year. The turnover 
should increase from Fr16 billion in 1993 to Fr20 billion in 
1994.

<F P=106> [``ub''--unattributed report: ``Stopping the Proliferation </F>
of Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons''] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel launched a German 
initiative on Wednesday [15 December] to prevent the further 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The 10-point 
proposal in the runup to the NATO summit at the beginning of 
next year is based on preventive strategies. In view of the 
``cooperative approach,'' coercive measures are only conceivable 
as a ``last resort'' and with the approval of the United Nations. 
  The foreign minister's initiative is seen in connection with 
U.S. plans to develop new weapons that can be used to intervene 
against ``irresponsible states'' or terrorist groups. The 
Europeans have so far only shown little interest in 
participating in such a concept. The Foreign Ministry announced 
that the U.S. considerations start where the those of the 
Germans end. Thus, there it does not see such a big 
contradiction. 
  Kinkel stressed that the proliferation of nuclear, 
biological, and chemical weapons represents one of the biggest 
dangers for world peace after the end of the East-West conflict. 
North Korea's refusal to allow inspections threatens peace in 
the entire region. In Ukraine, a new de-facto nuclear state 
might also develop. According to recent findings, up to 20 
states are currently developing nuclear carrier systems, and 10 
are developing chemical weapons. 
  Kinkel pleaded in favor of a global agreement on the 
nonproliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. 
The existing treaty should be extended indefinitely. 
International coordination should be aimed at first freezing 
the potentials of states that are suspected of spreading 
weapons. The CSCE was recommended as a model of regional 
nonproliferation policies. Other points are stronger export 
controls, with particular emphasis on the new supplying 
countries in the Third World, and much higher funds for the 
destruction of weapons of mass destruction. Kinkel also 
suggested an international plutonium control system, a nuclear 
weapons register with the United Nations, and a comprehensive 
agreement on a nuclear test stoppage. Whereas the United States 
wants to achieve a deterring effect with specific intervention 
threats, Kinkel's initiative is designed to integrate possible 
adventurers and to exert preventive pressure on them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Alone on the Bench''] </F>
  [Text] The attack on the principles of German weapons 
exports seems well prepared. The year-old demands by the 
industry that the strict guidelines must be relaxed to save jobs 
are being heeded by an important figure in Bonn: Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe. 
  In a letter, he drew Chancellor Helmut Kohl's attention to 
the ``fundamental problems'' that the weapons industry is 
facing. Out of ``vital security-political interests'' and in 
order to ``remain capable of cooperation,'' ``certain central 
capabilities,'' that is the ``system capability'' 
[Systemfaehigkeit] must be preserved. 
  According to Ruehe, this includes the state's technological 
capability to produce a number of different types of weapons, 
including aircraft, helicopters, tanks, submarines, and modern 
ammunition. 
  The minister believes that the system capability is in 
danger 
because of the ``reduced demand'' for weapons in Germany and 
NATO. Moreover, industry ``is being restricted because it has to 
observe tight export regulations,'' which are accepted by the 
cooperation partners in other NATO states to a decreasing 
extent. A ``new approach'' is required. All partners must 
change, ``including ourselves.'' 
  The lobbyists are increasing their pressure. They are urging 
the chancellor and the coalition to water down the existing 
export guidelines. 
  The budget for procurement, research, and development of the 
Bundeswehr has declined to about 40 percent of the 1990 volume. 
  The number of jobs in the defense industry has dropped by 50 
percent. According to the National Association of German 
Industries, only 10 to 20 percent of the manufacturing 
capacities that existed in the year 1989, when the GDR 
collapsed, will survive until 1995. 
  The Bavarians in particular are sounding the alarm. They see 
a danger to the defense industry in their country. The weekend 
before last [11-12 December], Bavaria's Economics Minister Otto 
Wiesheu convened an emergency summit with representatives of 
weapons companies, budget and defense politicians. 
  Arms exports must be ``a major issue,'' Werner Heinzmann 
(German Aerospace company) stressed. He announced ``dramatic 
consequences'' for guided weapons and radar systems. 
  Gerhard Haas (Krauss-Maffei company) warned against 
``immense 
problems'' concerning Germany's competitiveness. The degree of 
utilization of his enterprise has declined by 60 percent in five 
years. Helmut Wiesner (Siemens) spoke of a ``shock'' because of 
the budget cuts. ``There has been no planning basis for the 
past four years.'' 
  The summit described the Foreign Ministry as the main 
barrier 
for future businesses. Klaus Kinkel and his diplomats still 
cling to the old principles for the export of war weapons 
adopted in 1982. They allow: 
  -- Exports to NATO countries without restrictions; 
  -- Exports to states outside NATO only if the ``internal 
situation of the countries'' is stable, and if the delivery does 
not contribute to ``increasing existing tensions,'' and if the 
arms are only intended for the countries' own defense. 
  -- Consultations with the government are imperative before 
joint projects with foreign companies can be exported to 
non-NATO countries. 
  In addition, the export of certain goods that are mentioned 
in a special list is subject to permission. They include 
nuclear reactors, chemicals, biological agents, or software of 
strategic significance (dual-use goods), such as computers or 
radio sets that can be used both for military and civilian 
purposes. The supply of subcontractor products for weapons 
companies is subject to a permission if the recipients are 
classified as sensitive on the H- list. The list mentions 33 
countries, including China, Cuba, Israel, and Vietnam. 
  Kinkel has so far been proud of his reservation. At the 
Federal Security Council, where decisions are made, ``I am alone 
on the bench. The five others are against me.'' The pressure 
by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
[CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is 
increasing. 
  During his tour of Asia in the fall, the defense minister 
from the CDU acted as an enthusiastic weapons lobbyist. South 
Korea should be treated in the same way as the ASEAN states, he 
demanded. Unrestricted export of weapons should be allowed to 
this country, just like to the NATO countries. He has scored an 
initial success: The Federal Security Council approved the 
export of 120-millimeter-smooth-bore guns. 
  During his visit to Thailand, Ruehe noted ``great interest 
in 
German weapons technology.'' Saudi Arabia has wanted to buy 
Leopard-2 tanks for two years, State Secretary Joerg Schoenbohm 
added. 
  As far as the former East Bloc countries Poland, Hungary, 
and 
the Czech Republic are concerned, Ruehe sees ``the need to 
reconsider our positions.'' These states, which are members of 
the NATO Cooperation Council, should be given the same status as 
the NATO states, Ruehe wrote in his letter to the chancellor. 
Above all, they are interested in tanks. 
  The defense minister would like to revise the H-list. Israel 
(``an interesting cooperation partner'') and ``in a similar 
form'' Egypt could be deleted. The former FDP Economics 
Minister Juergen Moellemann would like to remove Taiwan from the 
H-list. Only then would German companies stand a chance to 
participate in the $200-billion investments, he told the 
chancellor. 
  A summit on a new overall concept, demanded by Ruehe, has 
not 
yet been held. Yet the officials from the Foreign and Economics 
Ministries have internally prepared the ``adaptation to the 
standards of the Western competitors.'' 
  Thus, the ``principles'' adopted in 1982 should be 
interpreted in a more generous way, and commercial and 
government projects with foreign partners should ``largely be 
treated in the same way,'' that is they should no longer be 
controlled. 
  Just in time for Christmas, the Federal Government has given 
a present. In a meeting of senior officials at the Chancellor's 
Office last week, the German position for the talks on 
harmonization within the European Union was determined: The 
tight German export control regulations for goods that can be 
used for military and civilian purposes is to be relaxed. At 
the Brussels Council of Foreign Ministers at the beginning of 
this week, the Germans want to agree to the compromise proposed 
by Belgium. 
  In the future, the export of dual-use goods that are not 
explicitly mentioned in the H-list will only be subject to 
permission in two areas: Subcontractor goods for weapons of 
mass destruction or booster rockets, but not for conventional 
arms projects. Thus, numerous exports to China or Iran will no 
longer be controlled in the future. 
  It is still unclear what will happen if an exporter knows 
that weapons are delivered to a country of the European Union 
but from there to another country. Supported by France and 
Great Britain, Germany demands an obligatory permit, whereas the 
European Commission views this as a major interference in the 
free single market. 
  Whereas Kohl suggested a tough attitude, the exports 
recommended the chancellor to ``show flexibility'' in the 
interests of Europe, if need be. 
  They are aware that accepting the proposal would involve 
``painful changes in the current German control practices.''

<F P=106> [Article by FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel: ``The </F>
Concept of `Extended Security'''] 
  [Text] Europe stands at the begining of a new era. With 
the decisions that we are making now in a period of upheaval and 
transition we will determine the political structures far into 
the next millennium. After the end of the East-West conflict, 
in which, as Raymond Aron said, peace was impossible and war 
improbable, the point is to make war impossible and peace the 
reality. Our goal must be a lasting and just peace order in 
Europe, which brings peace, stability, and security to all 
Europeans and, at the same time, safeguards democracy and human 
rights. 
  Since 1989, a revolution of security policy has taken place. 
The movement of the states in Central and Eastern Europe and of 
the former Soviet Union toward democracy, rule-of-law state, and 
market economy is making progress, but it has not yet become 
irreversible; the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact took place not 
quite three years ago; the pressure, with which the former 
Warsaw Pact states want to get into NATO and into the European 
Community, is rising; defense strategies, military doctrines, 
operation concepts: All this must be thought over once again. 
  However, at the latest since the outbreak of the combat 
actions in the former Yugoslavia, we know that the classical 
scenario of threat in Europe has not been replaced with general 
European peace. We are facing new risks: risks of instability, 
of the collapse of domestic order, ethnic conflicts, chauvinist 
claims to power, and nationalist myths. The challenges of 
poverty and hunger, of nuclear disasters a la Chernobyl, the 
proliferation of mass destruction weapons, potential mass 
migration movements, worldwide drug trade, and internationally 
organized crime require responses that no state can provide on 
its own anymore. 
  Today, security can less than ever be created in a national 
solo action; at the same time, security cannot be defined in 
purely military terms anymore. We need a comprehensive security 
policy approach, which unites political, economic, and military 
elements in a solid concept. Such a concept of ``extended 
security,'' as I have called it, cannot end at the classical 
Alliance border. It requires, in particular from us Germans, a 
complete revision of thinking. In a radically changed Europe, 
in a quickly changing world, Germany must become an export 
country also as regards security policy in the future -- our 
interests require this! We must use the unique opportunity for 
peace in Europe. 
  However, this opportunity does not lie in a militarization 
of 
foreign policy. On the contrary: Priority is given to solving 
conflicts by political means; our security policy must be a 
security policy of prevention, in which early recognition and 
preventive diplomacy are key concepts. However, the old logic 
of deterrence also applies to the effectiveness of preventive 
diplomacy. Crossing the threshold toward the use of force is 
prevented most easily if the aggressor must expect the use of 
superior force in return. This means: So as not being forced 
to fight, one must be able to fight. Also after the end of the 
East-West conflict, peace cannot be ensured lastingly without 
the possibility of using armed forces if necessary. Therefore, 
we continue to need functioning and democratically anchored 
armed forces. They are an indispensable element of a preventive 
security policy. 
  The establishment of the future security architecture is an 
all- European task. All of Europe must be integrated in this 
network. No new trenches must be torn up. A simple shifting of 
the current Alliance borders is not sufficient in any case. We 
need a network of multidimensional and differentiated 
interlacement, which integrates all participating states, does 
not isolate anyone, and takes the respective specific interests 
and abilities into consideration. 
  What are the elements of the concept of ``extended 
security''? 
  We need the United Nations as a legal basis and political 
legitimation for our actions. We must develop the CSCE into an 
area of collective security. European and global efforts for 
disarmament and arms control must be continued energetically. 
We need NATO with its dual approach, so as to keep the 
remaining military potentials under political control on the one 
hand and to support and accelerate the domestic transformation 
processes of the former Warsaw Pact states on the other. And we 
must gradually push ahead the European Union's ability to act on 
security policy. 
  1. After the end of the bipolar world order and of the 
blockade of the Security Council, the United Nations is facing a 
historical turning point. Today, it has the opportunity to 
become mankind's central guardian of peace and efficiently carry 
out its guardian function for the benefit of international law 
and human rights. This does not mean trusting with naive 
optimism that the UN Charter will always be observed by everyone 
in the future. However, what would be the alternative? If the 
United Nations does not intervene in cases such as Somalia, 
where state authority and order had collapsed completely and 
hundreds of thousands were facing death by starvation, who else 
should do it? Therefore, it was so important for the Federal 
Government to participate in the peace mission in Somalia. 
However: The United Nations has hit the limits of its 
capacity with its peace missions. Here, too, the subsidiary 
principle is valid: The United Nations needs support by 
regional agreements. In the area between Vancouver and 
Vladivostok, the CSCE can take over this task. Military 
capacities must also be contributed to this network. NATO has 
stated its readiness to implement UN peacekeeping measures. 
  At this year's General Assembly, I emphatically came out in 
favor of strengthening the United Nations as regards 
peacekeeping measures. The concept of ``stand-by forces,'' 
which was suggested by the secretary general, should be put into 
practice and also include civilian components, such as election 
helpers or police forces. In order to better prepare the 
blue-helmets for their missions, I suggested that the United 
Nations should do more coordination, work out common training 
guidelines, and establish its own training capacities. 
  A policy, which is based on the concept of ``extended 
security,'' presupposes unlimited German participation in 
safeguarding peace on the basis of the UN Charter. That is why 
it is so important that that we finally establish the 
constitutional bases for the use of German armed forces. 
However, even after the juridical clarification, every specific 
mission will depend on the fulfillment of political criteria. 
Thus, we will always have to ask whether a political concept is 
available for solving the conflict and whether the use of 
military means is suitable to contribute to that; whether the 
possibilities of a peaceful solution to the conflict have been 
exhausted; whether our interests and our values justify 
incurring a military risk; whether there is a justifiable 
relation between the price that we might have to pay and the 
potential success. Here, too, the primacy of policy must be 
applied. The application of military force must always be just 
the last resort. In the future, too, the German contribution to 
peace will have to be primarily of a political and economic 
nature and not of a military nature. The culture of restraint 
suits us Germans well. 
  2. The CSCE is the only all-European institution that 
comprises all states in the cooperation area from Vancouver and 
Vladivostok as equal members. Its basic principles--the 
renunciation of violence, respect for human rights and the right 
to self-determination, and the commitment to democracy and 
rule-of-law state principles--have contributed to overcoming the 
division of Europe and of Germany. It is to the credit of the 
CSCE network, that there never was a serious danger of military 
conflicts during the period of upheaval in 1989-90. 
  The CSCE, with its comprehensive approach, corresponds to a 
particular degree to the concept of ``extended security.'' From 
the very beginning, it defined security not only in purely 
military terms but embedded it in the overall relations, 
including the issues of human rights, democracy, and economic 
development. The focal issue of the ``new'' CSCE must be the 
early recognition, prevention, and peaceful solution of 
conflicts. The CSCE is called upon to prevent fires, it cannot 
itself act as the fire brigade. 
  In order to further expand the abilities of the CSCE and 
facilitate a speedy reaction in cases of crises, I have 
suggested a number of more far-reaching measures, regarding 
which the CSCE Foreign Ministers' Council adopted specific 
resolutions in Rome on 1 December 1993. Thus, in Vienna, a 
Permanent CSCE Committee will be established, which can act as a 
permanent organ in its own right, as well as a new, efficient 
CSCE Secretariat. The office of High Commissioner for National 
Minorities will be strengthened financially and materially. The 
Warsaw Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights will 
be used more strongly for coordination in developing democratic 
structures and in the early recognition of human rights 
violations. 
  The issue of peacekeeping will play an increasing role in 
the 
sphere of the CIS states. This, too, was on the agenda in Rome. 
Georgia, Moldova, and Tajikistan are topical cases. Peace 
missions in this region cannot be Russia's monopoly. Russia 
itself wants its missions to be legitimated by the CSCE. This 
is also in the interest of the other member states. However, 
these missions must be examined thoroughly in every individual 
case. They can be endorsed only if they clearly fulfill certain 
conditions--in particular the observation of international law 
and CSCE principles, impartiality, agreement by all parties, 
being embedded in efforts for political solutions, coordination 
with and the duty to report to the CSCE, which must itself be 
involved, as far as possible, by sending its own observers. 
  As a regional institution in the sense of Chapter VIII of 
the 
UN Charter, the CSCE can and should first try to solve conflicts 
within its sphere of application peacefully and upon its own 
responsibility. As was decided at the Helsinki summit in July 
1992, this includes sending its own peace missions. For this 
purpose, the CSCE may resort to organizations such as NATO or 
the Western European Union [WEU]. 
  In the Vienna CSCE forum for security cooperation, a code of 
behavior regarding questions of military-political security is 
being worked out. It is oriented not only toward the further 
fencing in of military power, it also offers the opportunity to 
prepare elements of a system of collective security in Europe. 
In my view, the goal should be an agreement, in which the 
participating states commit themselves to jointly appealing to 
the UN Security Council in case one member of the CSCE family 
disturbs peace and jointly apply the resulting decisions. The 
commitment to act against those who disturb peace should also 
include those institutions, which can be assigned the 
implementation of peace missions, that is, specifically NATO and 
WEU. 
  3. Our efforts in disarmament and arms control must be 
continued. Not only because the arms race continues in many 
parts of the world and the military budgets continue to rise. 
The elimination of the weapons arsenal, which dates back to the 
Cold War period, requires our full dedication. Thus, there are 
about 40,000 tonnes of chemical weapons in Russia, which must be 
destroyed in line with the agreement on chemical weapons. In 
addition, there are more than 25,000 warheads, to whose 
destruction Russia committed itself in the two START treaties 
and in unilateral statements. This process of destruction will 
take at least a decade and will devour sums amounting to 
billions. 
  a) First of all, there is the observation of the obligations 
of disarmament that have been incurred. This applies, in 
particular, to the CFE Treaty, which envisages the destruction 
of 50,4000 weapons systems by the end of 1995, that is mainly 
tanks, artillery, combat aircraft and helicopters, and whose 
implementation is making good progress. Later wishes for 
modification must not lead to a revision of the treaty itself. 
The unlimited implementation of the START package with the two 
START treaties and the follow-up stipulations of the Lisbon 
Protocol must not be delayed any longer. The ratification of 
START I, which has been carried out by Ukraine now only under 
certain conditions, is not sufficient. In talks with the 
Ukrainian Government and, most recently, at the CSCE Council 
meeting in Rome, I have repeatedly advocated that the Ukrainian 
Government should observe its obligations arising from the 
Lisbon Protocol and join the Nonproliferation Treaty as a 
nuclear-free state. This would make the path toward 
international cooperation considerably easier for Ukraine. 
  b) The danger of the proliferation of mass destruction 
weapons gives reason for utmost concern. Therefore, the 
nonproliferation system must be comprehensively strengthened. 
As a country, which gave up all mass destruction means at an 
early time and permanently, Germany has a special legitimation 
to call for progress in this matter. On the basis of this 
responsibility, I am advocating a particularly active 
nonproliferation policy. My proposals on this matter can be 
summarized in 10 points: 1. universal membership in the 
Nonproliferation Treaty as well as in conventions on biological 
and chemical weapons; 2. unlimited extension of the 
Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995; 3. expansion and utilization 
of the CSCE as a model of regional nonproliferation policy; 4. 
political strategies for the prevention of ``nuclear 
contagion''; 5. expansion of global cooperation in export 
control; 6. international armament aid for destroying mass 
destruction weapons; 7. establishment of an international 
plutonium regime; 8. introduction of a nuclear weapons registry 
at the United Nations; 9. a comprehensive nuclear test ban 
agreement; and 10. coercive measures by the United Nations as a 
last resort against proliferation on the basis of a 
corresponding mandate granted by the Security Council. 
  In particular the reliable and environmentally compatible 
abolition of the mass destruction weapons in Russia and in the 
other CIS republics is in Germany's direct interest. Since 
these states need both financial and technological aid, the 
Federal Government supported this process at an early time with 
a policy oriented toward the long term. For this purpose, it 
has concluded an agreement with the Russian Federation on the 
abolition of nuclear and chemical weapons and has made 10 
million German marks available for this purpose this year alone. 
In a framework agreement with Ukraine, too, we have declared 
our readiness to provide disarmament aid. However, this 
disarmament aid must be further expanded and increased. 
  c) Arms control must not exclude special regional problems, 
such as the ones in Southeastern Europe for instance. 
Therefore, we have taken the initiative to discuss with our 
partners concepts of arms control policy for the Balkan region, 
which should be implemented within the framework of the CSCE and 
should be included in the current efforts of the peace process 
of the former Yugoslavia. Proceeding from confidence-building 
and stabilizing measures, a reduction, limitation, and 
restriction of the armed forces of all successor states of the 
former Yugoslavia should be striven for. 
  4. NATO, too, is facing the task of examining, adjusting, 
and supplementing its role. First steps have already been 
taken. Others will follow at the forthcoming NATO summit at the 
beginning of next year. The NATO ministers' meeting and the 
meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council on 2 and 3 
December have established good preconditions for that. One 
thing is clear: For the European security architecture and our 
German interests, the preservation of the central functions of 
the Alliance, of the protection it provides, and of its 
guarantees is as important as the close transatlantic ties. The 
presence of the United States in Europe is an indispensable 
element of a stable peace order all over Europe. 
  With the goal of a Partnership for Peace, the security 
policy 
cooperation between the European and American members of the 
Alliance is to be extended toward Central and Eastern Europe. 
As a first step, the Alliance will, as I have demanded for 
months, offer cooperation and consultation agreements to 
non-members from Central and Eastern Europe as well as Russia, 
Ukraine, and also other CIS states. This is to develop into a 
network of close cooperation relations, which are tailored to 
the respective partner -- a network that is to be the expression 
of closer security policy ties at present and a preliminary 
stage for potential membership in the future. 
  With the expansion of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, 
which I have also proposed, the Alliance will set another sign 
of opening up toward the east. Then the Cooperation Council 
will no longer be just a dialogue forum but will develop into an 
institution, within the framework of which armed forces in East 
and West could begin to plan and exercise joint peace missions. 
This is one of the main reasons why the expansion by the 
neutral and nonaligned states, such as Sweden, Finland, and 
Austria, which I have suggested, is useful and necessary. 
  The security, which the Alliance ensures for its members 
toward the inside and toward the outside, has the effect of a 
magnet all over the CSCE area. Therefore, the forthcoming NATO 
summit should affirm the Alliance's basic readiness to open up 
toward new members. A partnership of NATO with the Eastern 
neighbors must, however, not lead to the isolation of individual 
European states. Therefore, a controlled and gradual opening of 
the Euro-Atlantic institutions toward the East should make it 
possible not only for the Central and East European states but 
also for Russia, Ukraine, and other states of the former Soviet 
Union to enter a strategic partnership with NATO. We must not 
alarm others with our efforts to give some states a feeling of 
greater security. This applies, above all, also in view of the 
latest developments in Russia. We must continue our policy of 
supporting the reform forces without any restrictions, 
contribute to making Russia's path toward democratic structures 
irreversible, and promote Russian foreign policy,which is 
oriented toward integration in the international community of 
states. 
  5. The European Union and the European defense and security 
identity, which is to be achieved through it, are a constituent 
element of a concept of ``extended security.'' With the 
expansion of the WEU as the defense policy arms of the European 
Union, Europe accepts grater responsibility for its security and 
defense. In this connection, it is important that this policy 
is developed further in close and constant coordination with our 
North American allies. 
  The expansion of the WEU's operational capabilities is 
making 
progress: The WEU Planning Staff has been established; the 
chiefs of the general staffs meet regularly; the member states 
have named their military units that are assigned to the WEU; 
the work for intensified armament cooperation is making 
progress. The Eurocorps, which was put into operation recently, 
has now been assigned to the WEU. At the same time, it remains 
linked with the integrated command structure of NATO. With the 
monitoring measures in the Adriatic and on the Danube, the WEU 
has shown that it is not just an organization on paper. 
  The WEU, too, has a specific role in expanding cooperation 
with the states of Central and Eastern Europe. In its 
cooperation forum it cooperates with those states on security 
policy, which have prospects for becoming members in the 
European Union. Together with my French colleague, I suggested 
that these states should be offered a special status in the WEU. 
With this they are to be prepared in terms of security and 
defense policy for the future membership in the European Union. 
The WEU ministers' meeting on 22 November 1993 took up this 
German-French suggestion. 
  At their summit in Copenhagen in June 1993, the EC member 
states stressed their intention to accept the new democracies in 
Eastern Europe as members as soon as they are able to fulfill 
the political and economic obligations arising from membership. 
Until this time, practical cooperation in the fields of foreign 
policy, trade, international security, immigration, and 
environment will become increasingly closer. This process of 
transformation also contributes to increasing security. 
  Any country that joins the European Union will then also be 
a 
candidate for membership in the WEU. Today all WEU members are 
also members in NATO. New members of the European Union should, 
therefore, get access to NATO through their accession to the 
WEU. By linking membership in the WEU with membership in NATO we 
can also make sure that Europe's transatlantic anchor does not 
come loose. 
  6. It is necessary to link long-term prospects with specific 
steps. The new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe need 
signs of our solidarity. They need a clear orientation and 
visible proof of the fact that the transformation, which is 
painful for them, pays off. At the same time, Russia and 
Ukraine need assurances that they are and remain fully 
integrated in the establishment of a cooperative European 
security architecture. 
  It will be an important task of the NATO summit in January 
1994 to further develop the exist structures in the sense of the 
concept of extended security, as it has already been done at the 
ministers' meetings of NATO, the WEU, and the CSCE. I expect 
this summit to provide new stimuli, which will take us closer to 
the goal of a lasting and just peace order for Europe.

  [Text] Magdeburg (DPA) -- No radioactive waste will be 
stored at Morsleben (Saxony-Anhalt), the only nuclear waste 
storage site in Germany, before the end of January. Radioactive 
materials will definitely not be disposed of in Morsleben over 
the next few days, [Saxony-Anhalt] Environment Ministry 
spokeswoman Lydia Hueskens said in Magdeburg today. 
  The first shipment would probably not come from western 
Germany but from Greifswald. It is not yet known when the 
nuclear waste will arrive. The earliest possible date is 20 
January since the ministry must be notified four weeks before 
disposal. 
  Last week the Magdeburg Higher Administrative Court ruled 
that west German nuclear waste could be stored in Morsleben too, 
since there are no indications of ``manifest safety 
shortcomings'' at the underground storage site. The Greenpeace 
environmental organization expressed fears at the weekend that 
western nuclear waste might be taken to Morsleben in the next 
few days. 
  Greenpeace members have already occupied the Morsleben site 
twice. They criticize the fact that there is no provision for 
monitoring procedures or any study on the long-term safety of 
the dump, which operated in GDR times.

  [Text] Three multinational pharmaceutical companies, 
Ciba-Geigy, Sandoz, and Hoechst, have already scheduled 
experiments at Elettra. Elettra is a super microscope that uses 
synchrotron light and began operating in Trieste on 4 October. 
According to the three companies, in the future 80 percent of 
the research into the structure of new pharmaceuticals will be 
performed using this extremely powerful insturment. 
  Elettra, the most powerful super microscope in Europe, took 
6 
years to build and to date has cost 300 billion lire. Inside 
Elettra electron beams are brought an energy of 1.5 Giga 
electron volts by a linear particle accelerator and are then 
injected into an accumulator ring containing curved magnet and 
other devices that cause them to loose energy under the form of 
synchrotorn light. 
  This intense radiation is then directed into channels 
leading 
to experimental laboratories where the researchers work. The 
light produced acts like an extremely powerful microscope that 
is capable of observing matter, both organic and inorganic, in 
great detail. ``It is unique in the world because of the 
particular `brilliance' of its light beam,'' said the physicist 
and Elettra Scientific Committee President Giorgio Maritondo, 
``this light is capable of investigating the chemical bonds of 
the molecules contained in any given substance.'' Elettra can 
be used in the field of biology to examine the distribution of 
toxic elements in cerebral cell systems. 
  The ``light'' will not be used for pharmaceutical research 
alone. Many other sectors will benefit from Elettra: its 50 
``light lines'' will enable unique experiments to be performed, 
both basic and applied research, in the field of computer 
science for the production of integrated circuits; in the 
mechanical field for the manufacture of microcomponents, and in 
the chemical sector for the study of new materials.

<F P=106> [``gag''-signed report: ``Skoda Allegedly Does Not Export </F>
Nuclear Technology''] 
  [Text] Prague/Plzen -- Skoda Plzen has never collaborated 
with the U.S. Westinghouse firm on any nuclear power station 
project, Jaroslav Hudec, press spokesman for the concern, has 
told us. The only thing that it does for the overseas firm is 
to manufacture components for the distribution of high voltage 
power, and these components have nothing to do with the actual 
nuclear operation. 
  The spokesman also mentioned a project in a preparatory 
stage 
of the [word illegible] of fuel rods for nuclear reactors. In 
this instance, too, we deal purely with engineering production. 
The talks with the German firm Siemens then pertain only to the 
manufacture of turbines. The spokesman was responding in this 
manner to speculation that these firms are trying through Skoda 
to reach Iran with their nuclear technology, which laws in their 
own countries do not facilitate. 
  Nevertheless, official circles in Israel have expressed 
concern about such a danger. Jaroslav Hudec again recalled that 
the discussion about nuclear power generation was also on the 
agenda during the visit to Iran by Skoda Plzen Director General 
Lubomir Soudek. The Czech Foreign Ministry was informed in 
advance about these talks with the provision that all these 
discussions are of a fact-finding nature only. Any steps in 
this direction will be taken, according to the spokesman, in 
accordance with the laws in effect.

  [Text] It has been learned that the United States and 
North Korea on 20 December had an unofficial working-level 
contact in New York and continued to compromise concerning the 
resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue that is in 
stalemate. 
  According to Washington sources, in the 20 December contact, 
the United States received the official North Korean response to 
the U.S. proposal of nuclear inspection presented on 10 
December. It is also known from the sources that although North 
Korea showed some progress in its attitude, it will not accept 
the U.S. proposal 100 percent. 
  In the unofficial working-level contact on 10 December in 
New 
York, the United States repeatedly urged North Korea to accept

  [Text] Vilnius, Dec 20, ELTA -- Leaders of Ignalina nuclear 
power plant and German company ``GNB'' signed a contract on the 
supply of 60 containers to store nuclear fuel used in RBMK-1500 
type reactors, director-general of Ignalina plant Viktor 
Shevaldin told ELTA on Monday [20 December]. 
  The containers will be made in Germany and brought to 
Lithuania a year after the signing of the contract. They will be 
sent in separate cargoes within 15 months. Shevaldin said the 
containers belong to the famous ``Castor'' group whose 
production corresponds with strict technological standards. They 
are very safe and used in the world for 20 years. Such 
containers are used in Finland, France, Germany, Britain, 
Russia, Switzerland, U.S.A., Sweden, etc. 
  ``GNB'' is a specialized company producing containers for 
storage of used nuclear fuel. 
  Shevaldin also said the international competition to arrange 
a project of a storage was won by a Swedish company ``SKB.'' The 
company is solving questions of storage of nuclear fuel and 
nuclear waste. He said it would be the first dry interim storage 
of a nuclear fuel used in RBMK-type reactors.

  [Text] Tehran, Dec 19 (AFP)--Russia is determined to help 
Iran build a nuclear power plant in the southern port city of 
Bushehr, but financial problems have delayed the project, the 
Russian ambassador said here. 
  In an interview with the weekly KAYHAN HAVAI, Sergey 
Tretyakov said an agreement had been reached with Iran ``in 
principle'' to set up the plant in Bushehr on the Gulf, and to 
complete another left unfinished by a German company. 
  ``Despite opposition from Washington, we are determined to 
go 
ahead with the project,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We have an 
independent policy with respect to Iran.'' 
  Tretyakov said negotiations were underway and the project 
would be implemented only if ``financial problems are sorted 
out,'' but he did not clarify what the problems were. 
  Diplomats here said Iran, faced with a serious cash crisis, 
had asked Moscow to finance the project, but Russia had refused, 
due to its own economic problems. 
  Discussions between Iran and Russia have been going on for 
more than a year over the purchase of two 440-megawatt 
VVER-440-213 nuclear reactors for the new plant. 
  The German corporation Siemens launched the project when the 
late shah was in power, but broke off work during the Islamic 
revolution and the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. 
  The cost of the project has been put at 3.7 billion dollars. 
  Iran has repeatedly called for work to resume but the German 
government has refused, amid concerns that it could be accused 
of aiding nuclear proliferation in a country suspected by the 
West of aiming to build nuclear weapons. 
  The possibility of Russian involvement in finishing the 
plant, which is 80 percent complete, was discussed during a trip 
to Moscow by an Iranian delegation in the summer, Tretyakov said 
in an interview with the daily ABRAR in August. 
  Iran and Russia signed an accord on civil nuclear 
cooperation 
earlier this year, but did not disclose details of the agreement. 
  During a visit here in March, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey 
Kozyrev said such cooperation would take place within the 
regulations set by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and 
under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA). 
  Tehran has repeatedly accused Western countries, notably the 
United States, of preventing it from obtaining nuclear 
technology for civilian purposes. 
  In February, Iran also signed an accord with China for the 
purchase of two 300-megawatt nuclear reactors for non-military 
use. The project with Beijing has also been delayed because of 
financial problems, according to Chinese diplomats in Tehran.

  [Text] India has expressed the hope that the foreign 
secretary-level talks with Pakistan in the first week of next 
month will be successful and lead to a movement forward. 
Addressing the Consultative Committee Meeting of members of 
parliament attached to his ministry, the minister of state for 
external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, described as untrue the 
observation that the Simla agreement has not been functional. 
Mr. Bhatia reiterated India's total commitment to human rights 
and stated that the Human Rights Commission Bill has been 
introduced in parliament. 
  Regarding declaration of Pakistan as a terrorist state, Mr. 
Bhatia said that all requisite evidence available with India has 
been passed on to the United States. The U.S. has not taken the 
final step for its own reasons. 
  On Indo-U.S. relations, Mr. Bhatia allayed the apprehensions 
of the members and asserted that New Delhi will not compromise 
country's sovereignty and its independent position under 
pressure. He said India has explained its point of view 
frequently in detail and will continue to do so. He also said 
India's position on nonproliferation is very clear and based on 
sound and fundamental principles.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: ``Fear of Nuclear Transit </F>
Through Norway''] 
  [Text] ``It seems a likely possibility that stolen nuclear 
materials is being transported through Norway.'' 
  This is said by Erling Stranden, who is the director of the 
Department for Preparedness and Security at the National 
Radiation Protection Board. Stranden says that it is not 
inconceivable that the thieves who stole three fuel rods from 
military storage in Murmansk either have smuggled the stolen 
goods out through Finnmark or that they will try to do so. 
``Norway could definitely be part of a smuggling route,'' he 
says. 
  Thomas Nilsen from Bellona, having worked with nuclear 
threats in the north for many years, agrees: ``Inspection at the 
border crossing at Storskog should be considerably improved. I 
have crossed the border about 40 times since 1988. My luggage 
has never been inspected; either on the Norwegian or on the 
Russian side. According to our sources it has been possible for 
a long time to buy different types of radioactive materials on 
the streets of Murmansk. Almost anything can be obtained at Kola 
as long as one has dollars. As customers for these kinds of 
materials are found in other countries, it is probable that 
Norway will be part of a smuggling route,'' Nilsen says. 
<H5>  Easy To Smuggle </H5>
  Last night it became clear that the three fuel rods are 1 
meter long and have a diameter of 5-6 cm. They are unused and 
were to be used in the reactor of one of the many nuclear 
submarines at Kola. It is thought to be a simple affair to 
transport three such metal pipes without being discovered. 
  As the rods are unused, radiation is minimal. They are 
therefore relatively harmless to the thieves, as well as 
unsuitable as a terrorist weapon. Used rods could have been 
dumped in sources of drinking water, and so on, and poisonous 
plutonium, strontium, and cesium would have caused enormous 
damage. But as these three rods are unused, they are relatively 
harmless. They contain mainly highly enriched uranium. Even with 
a geiger counter the rods would be hard to detect. 
  Departmental Director Stranden at the National Radiation 
Protection Board says that it would hardly be noticeable on the 
geiger counter if measured from the outside of a car that had 
the rods in the trunk. ``However, had a customs inspector found 
the three suspect metal tubes and measured them directly, the 
radiation would have been noticeable,'' Stranden says. 
  Consul General Knut Hauge in Murmansk thinks there is no 
immediate reason to fear that Norway will become a transit 
country for stolen Russian nuclear equipment: ``We must of 
course be prepared, but the control at the Norwegian-Russian 
border is, in my opinion, so good that this route is probably 
not the most attractive one out of Russia,'' Hauge says. 
<H5>  Good for Bombs </H5>
  As the three fuel rods were to be used in nuclear 
submarines, 
the uranium in the rods is probably highly enriched--up to 90 
percent. That makes the uranium suitable for bomb production. To 
make even a small nuclear bomb, however, 5 to 10 kilos of 
uranium is needed. The three short rods are not big enough to 
contain that much. Russian authorities have not disclosed how 
much uranium the rods contained. 
  Sources within nuclear circles in Murmansk yesterday 
afternoon informed the Norwegian consulate general in that city 
that since the rods are unused, it is unthinkable that they can 
be used for terrorist purposes. However, the uranium can be 
extracted from the rods and be used, for instance to produce 
bombs, according to Russian sources. 
  Stranden agrees: ``Even though there is not enough uranium 
in 
these rods to make a bomb, it could be a first step for 
countries wanting to develop nuclear arms. We know there are 
nations having the technology and knowledge to make bombs, but 
which lack highly enriched materials,'' Stranden says to 
AFTENPOSTEN. 
<H5>  Planned Theft </H5>
  The theft was discovered in the middle of the day on 27 
November in connection with a routine control. Police in 
Murmansk so far do not know anything further as to when the rods 
were stolen, but have asked for help from the public. The rods 
were stolen from a storage facility at the military Rosta 
shipyard in the northern Lenin area of Murmansk. 
  According to Hauge the police in Murmansk take it as a given 
that this was a theft to order. ``The thieves obviously knew 
what they were looking for, and according to the police, they 
were familiar with the shipyard,'' he says. The fact that the 
police are asking for help in a military theft is regarded as 
sensational. 
  Spokesmen for the National Radiation Protection Board in 
Norway, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others 
reiterated yesterday how frightening it is that such a theft can 
happen. ``But we had to take into account that such things might 
happen in today's Russia,'' says spokesman for the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Ingvard Havnen. 
  When the Soviet Union collapsed, much of government control 
disappeared. At the same time much of the control of Russia's 
many nuclear installations disappeared. 
  As late as two to three weeks ago a couple of kilos of 
Russian uranium was discovered by Turkish police. And just over 
a week ago fuel rods were stolen from the Ignalina power plant 
in Lithuania. 
  Nilsen thinks that the danger of radioactive materials 
falling into the hands of terrorists or others with no 
legitimate reason to possess them pose a greater security risk 
in the north than the nuclear reactors themselves. He refers to 
many episodes on the Kola peninsula as proof that security 
measures are terrible. 
  In 1992 KGB agents carried out an arranged ``attack'' 
against 
the nuclear icebreaker Sibir at the Murmansk docks. The agents 
were able to get as far as to the reactor section before they 
were discovered. The KGB did this to show how poor nuclear 
security in the country has become. In the same year a Russian 
television journalist was able to smuggle 200 grams of cesium 
out of Atomflot, the icebreaker base in Murmansk. This comes in 
addition to small fires in nuclear submarines and near accidents 
at the nuclear power plant in Kola. Nilsen also refers to the 
two occasions when he visited this nuclear power plant: ``Both 
times we were shown around deep down in the reactor areas and in 
the important control rooms without anyone checking our 
luggage.'' 
<H5>  No Fuss in Murmansk </H5>
  The nuclear theft has not frightened the city's inhabitants. 
  Yesterday morning the city's people could read an 
announcement in the local paper that three fuel rods had been 
discovered stolen from a storage area in town last Saturday. It 
further announced that an investigating committee had been 
formed consisting of 18 people, from the military prosecuting 
authorities, from the counter espionage groups, and from the 
police respectively. A special telephone number for tips to the 
police was established for this purpose. 
  Hauge in Murmansk says that nobody in the city is concerned 
about such matters as long as there is no danger of an increase 
in radiation in the near vicinity. ``It was not even mentioned 
in the local news this evening. I have tried all day to call the 
police using the published hot-line number, but nobody 
answered,'' Hauge said last night.

  [Text] Algiers, 18 Dec (XINHUA) -- Algerian Prime Minister 
Malek told this reporter here today that have always been ``very 
good state-to-state relations'' between Algeria and China. 
  Malek invited several foreign reporters stationed in Algeria 
for a luncheon today. Speaking of the 35th anniversary of the 
establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Algeria, he 
noted that ``cooperation between Algeria and China has been 
fruitful,'' because there is a ``long traditional friendship 
between Algerian and Chinese Governments.'' 
  Malek told reporters present at the luncheon that the 
nuclear 
reactor for research jointly built by Algerian and Chinese 
personnel--an outcome of fruitful cooperation between the two 
nations--will be completed soon. 
  Malek answered questions raised by the reporters on 
Algeria's 
political and economic situations. He reiterated that the 
Algerian Government is determined to fight terrorism and bring 
about national stability at an early date.

  [Text] Schwerin (DDP/ADN) -- According to information in 
the SCHWERINER VOLKSZEITUNG newspaper, the Federal Government 
will continue to arm the Indonesian Navy. Parallel to the 
decision to deliver 39 former warships from the NVA [National 
People's Army of the former GDR] to the highly indebted 
island-state, the Federal Security Council has also approved the 
export of a 209 class submarine. Bonn has also given the green 
light for the options for the construction of two further 
submarines. The article is based on Bonn's response to a 
question from SPD [Social Democratic Party] Bundestag deputies 
on arms deals with Indonesia, the paper writes (Friday edition). 
  The submarines, each of which costs 665.1 million German 
marks, are covered by the Hermes government export credit 
guarantee. At the same time, the Federal Government has 
admitted that, contrary to previous statements, it has only 
partially demilitarized the former NVA ships or has supplied 
them as complete weapons systems to the Indonesian Navy, it is 
further reported. Sixteen ``Parchim'' ships have thus been 
handed over to the Indonesian Navy in a fully-equipped state. 
The delivery of the 39 NVA ships has also been guaranteed to 
the tune of 689.9 million German marks.

  [Text] Sydney, Dec 11 (AFP) -- Britain has closed the door 
on a controversial part of its relationship with Australia by 
agreeing to pay a 45 million dollar [Australian dollars] (30 
million U.S.) settlement over sites it once used for nuclear 
tests, Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner said Saturday. 
  The ex-gratia payment ends a long-running dispute over the 
clean- up of British test sites at Maralinga, Monte Bello 
Islands and Emu Field in the southern Australian outback. 
  Australia has long argued that it was Britain's 
responsibility to clean up the nuclear contamination which it 
claims still affects the lives of local Aborigines. 
  ``The British decision is welcomed, it will allow Britain 
and 
Australia to put behind us one of the saddest aspects of our 
relationship,'' Tickner told AFP from Canberra. 
  ``It is almost impossible to conceive now that atomic 
weapons 
were actually tested in Australia, they will leave a legacy of 
contamination for many thousands of years to come.'' 
  The indigenous Aborigine population was driven off its 
traditional lands to make way for the British nuclear tests and 
returned in the 1980s only to learn the area had been exposed to 
high levels of toxic contamination. 
  ``As a result of the testing, Aboriginal people lost the use 
of their traditional lands, but the compensation will allow a 
clean-up and fencing where appropriate and will allow us to have 
a much more mature relationship between Britain and Australia,'' 
Tickner said. 
  The Aborigines filed a formal complaint to Britain in 1991, 
leading Australia to press Britain to share rehabilitation and 
compensation costs of the Maralinga nuclear testing range, 
abandoned by Britain in 1967. 
  The settlement, to be paid to Australia in installments over 
the next six years, removed a ``major irritant'' to the 
relationship between Australia and Britain, British Foreign 
Office Minister Alastair Goodlad said in London Friday. 
  Australia had agreed in turn to abandon all further claims, 
he said. 
  Australian Primary Industries and Energy Minister Simon 
Crean 
and Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said in a joint 
statement from Canberra that resolution of the issue had 
vindicated Australia's stance about the condition of the sites 
left by Britain. 
  ``Australia has never accepted Britain's denial of legal or 
moral responsibility for this issue,'' the ministers said. The 
condition of the sites left by Britain ``was unacceptable even 
by the standards that then applied.'' 
  A study by Australian, British and U.S. scientists, 
completed 
in 1990, traced the full extent of plutonium on Aborginial land 
and found that the Aborgines' outdoor lifestyle made them highly 
vulnerable to the threat of plutonium, a carcinogen.

  [Text] Beijing, Dec. 20 KYODO -- Japan and China ended 
their first talks ever on mutual security concerns Monday [20 
December], with both sides vowing to promote mutual 
understanding and greater transparency in the areas of defense 
and security, a Japanese official said. 
  Hiroshi Oe, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, said that 
Japan and China agreed to hold security talks annually and that 
talks between the two countries' defense ministries will also be 
held beginning early next year. 
  Tadashi Ikeda, director general of the Asian Affairs Bureau 
of the Foreign Ministry, represented Japan in the one-day talks, 
which were arranged in a meeting between foreign ministers in 
May. 
  Oe said that both sides acknowledged the importance of 
upcoming multilateral talks at an Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) forum on security, also to start next year. 
  Both sides agreed that the United Nations Cambodian 
peacekeeping operation was successful and expressed willingness 
to cooperate in the future, Ikeda said. 
  The Chinese side, represented by Wang Yingfang, director of 
the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry, said 
that China is pursuing its own approach to North Korea 
concerning the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula, but did 
not elaborate, Oe said. 
  Wang also stressed China's willingness to cooperate in all 
nuclear test ban treaties, while emphasizing China's policy of 
refusal of first strike capability and refusal to use nuclear 
weapons on nonnuclear countries, he said. 
  He also said that China refused sales of M-11 missile 
technology to Pakistan and was appropriately managing its 
control of chemical weapons. 
  China also denied that it is planning to build or buy an 
aircraft carrier, Oe said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Dec. 16 -- Minister of Internal Affairs 
Andrzej Milczanowski and the head of the German Federal Criminal 
Department (BKA) Hans-Ludwig Zachert today discussed ways to 
jointly combat organized crime, drugs and cars smuggling, as 
well as German assistance to the Polish police. 
  Before his departure to Germany, Zachert said that 
Milczanowski was in favour of a closer cooperation with the BKA 
and planned to meet the German interior minister in 1994. 
  One of the major issues to be dealt with jointly by the 
police services of the two countries is smuggling and trade in 
radioactive materials. According to the BKA head, 12 incidents 
of ``nuclear crime'' were recorded in Germany in 1990, 160 in 
1992 and over 200 during the first three months of 1993. 
  Poland and Germany have signed an agreement on cooperation 
in 
combating organized crime. Within this framework the German 
government is to grant the Polish police in 1992-94 material aid 
worth 6 million marks. Poland has already received cars, 
motorbikes, drug detecting kits and cameras. It was agreed 
during Zachert's visit that the assistance will also cover an 
exchange of experts in fighting economic fraud.

  [Excerpt] Prague, Dec 22 (CTK) -- The Iranian ambassador to 
Prague last night issued a statement apparently intended to 
distance Iran from reports that the country was seeking to 
obtain nuclear technology from the Czech Skoda Plzen company, 
REUTER's news agency reported Tuesday. 
  Ambassador Rasoul Movahedian, who on Tuesday met Skoda 
General Director Lubomir Soudek, said he welcomed stronger ties 
with the Czech heavy engineering company but said the 
relationship was aimed at peaceful projects only, the agency 
said. 
  Ambassador Movahedian's meeting with Soudek was confirmed to 
CTK last night by Skoda's spokesman Jaroslav Hudec. He gave no 
details of the contents of the meeting, describing it as a 
courtesy call. 
  In his statement, Movahedian said Iran gives priority to 
``friendly and traditional partners'' who offer reliable 
technical and economic joint projects. 
  ``Iran has really no intention to be engaged in non-peaceful 
efforts, neither by the Czech side nor by any other 
international side,'' the agency quoted Movahedian as saying.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``SAGEM: Nav/Attack Systems for </F>
Fighter Aircraft Upgrades: Belgium, Pakistan and Now Poland''] 
  [Text] SAGEM has been selected for the avionics system 
upgrade of the PZL Iryda I-22. The operation will take place on 
the PZL MIELEC premises, in cooperation with the Polish Aviation 
Institute, designer of the aircraft. The upgraded version Iryda 
M-93 will be provided with an inertial navigation system (SAGEM 
ULISS) wide field of view HUD [Head-up Display], HOTAS [Hands On 
Throttle and Stick] pilot interface, full color EFIS [Electronic 
Flight Information System] and extended attack capability. The 
first flight tests are due by the end of 1993. 
  Qualification of MAESTRO [Modular Avionics Enhancement 
System 
Targeted for Retrofit Operations], the integrated Weapon 
Delivery, Navigation and Reconnaissance System designed and 
supplied by SAGEM is in progress to equip the Mirage III fleet 
of the Pakistani Air Force. Upgrade plans include extension of 
Air to Air operational performance and introduction of Air to 
Ground mode, to give the aircraft multimission capabilities. In 
addition, the aircraft will be fitted with multimode pulse 
doppler radar. 
  A first production order was issued in June 1993. Two 
versions are being retrofitted, the trainer/strike aircraft and 
the multirole fighter. Another version of this system, designed 
by SAGEM for the Belgian Air Force Mirage V has recently 
completed with full success an extensive flight test campaign. 
Full operational clearance was awarded by the customer in May 
1993. Production phase has recently started for upgrade of 15 
single-seat Mirage V BA and 5 two-seat Mirage V BDs, two 
aircraft versions are concerned, the trainer/fighter and the 
attack/reconnaissance. MAESTRO (Modular Avionics Enhancement 
System Targeted for Retrofit Operations), with the SAGEM 
Nav/Attack systems for aircraft upgrades as cornerstone, 
provides capabilities at par with today's front line fighters. 
It features: 
  --Full inertial and GPS [Global Positioning System] 
performance (SAGEM ULISS or SIGMA) 
  --TERCOR terrain contour matching for stealth navigation 
and blind attack (SAGEM EBS 1501 Bubble Memory) 
  --Wide field of view HUD, FLIR [Forward-Looking Infrared] 
compatible (SAGEM Group IRIS FLIR), 
  --HOTAS pilot interface (Hands On Throttle and Stick), 
  --Air-to-Ground and Air-to-Air fire control including Radar 
or Laser Rangefinder 
  --Self protection system (Radar Warning, Chaff and Flares) 
  --All digital third generation mission planning system 
(SAGEM CIRCE 20001). 
  SAGEM holds full flight test and qualification. The upgrade 
is performed within the customer's overhaul facility, enabling 
an extremely short turn-around and an increase of customer's 
support capability. The same system and methodology have been 
applied to a number of other aircraft: Jaguar International, 
A5, etc.

<F P=106> [Guido Olimpio report: "Greek Terrorist Chiefs Seek Help in </F>
Tehran"] 
  [Text] The Iranian ayatollahs are seeking new allies. In 
mid-November, Middle Eastern sources told CORRIERE DELLA SERA 
that two important figures from the Greek "17 November" 
terrorist group went to Tehran for secret talks with Pasdaran 
officers and cadres of the Iranian intelligence services. 
During their stay in the Iranian capital, the Greek extremists 
met with Mohsen Rezai, the powerful and influential leader of 
the "Guardians of the Revolution," and with officers charged 
with exporting the Shi'ite revolution. The "17 November" 
leaders went to assess the possibility of cooperating with 
Tehran and asked their interlocutors to provide arms and funds. 
According to leaks, the visit to Iran was the first step toward 
a new offensive by the Greek extremists, not only against local 
targets but also against Western offices, personalities, and 
institutions. 
  Tehran, therefore, apparently has been successful in 
bringing 
into its fold one of Europe's most dangerous and mysterious 
subversive groups. The formation takes its name from the fierce 
repressive action implemented on 17 November 1973 by the Greek 
military junta. Consisting of no more than 20 to 30 members, 
the "17 November" group has played a major role in a spectacular 
series of attacks. The assault groups have killed judges, 
politicians, and even the CIA's "mission chief" in Greece. 
  The extremist group always has been shrouded in mystery. 
Indeed, the police have failed to capture even one of them, a 
situation that has fueled the strangest speculation. Some 
people even have gone as far as to suspect the secret services, 
while others have accused Papandreou's PASOK [Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement] of complicity. In the past, evidence has 
surfaced linking the "17 November" group to Arab or Palestinian 
007's. 
  In recent weeks the ayatollahs once more have loosened their 
purse strings to fund Middle Eastern extremist formations. In 
fact, during a recent meeting in Damascus, the Iranians promised 
Hamas $10 million.

  [Text] Athens, Dec 28, IRNA -- The Islamic Republic Embassy 
Tuesday dismissed an Italian press report claiming that the 
Greek terrorist group `17 November' recently held secret talks 
in Tehran. The embassy described the report as "totally baseless 
and lies." 
  "The report is absolutely baseless and completely lies and 
false. It is a wicked attempt to harm the very close and 
friendly relations between Greece and Iran," an Iranian Embassy 
source told IRNA.

  [Text] Mexico City, 29 Dec (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican judicial 
authorities denied here today that there is any evidence to 
indicate that members of the separatist ETA [Basque Fatherland 
and Liberty] are operating in Mexico, as Spanish media reported. 
  The Attorney General's Office (PGR) has not received any 
reports or evidence about the presence of ETA members in Mexico 
to promote armed actions from this country. 
  Information obtained at the PGR indicated that if ETA 
members 
are found to be operating in the country, the appropriate 
authorities will investigate the situation. The PGR stated in a 
communique that neither the Mexican judicial authorities nor 
Interpol have been asked by any Spanish authority to investigate 
the presence of members of the separatist organization. 
  Mexico conducts investigations with strict respect for the 
law, and the authorities do not allow themselves to be swayed by 
rumors that sometimes only confuse the public. 
  The Spanish newspaper ABC published a report stating that 
ETA 
members direct activities of that organization form Mexico and 
that they have infiltrated various sectors of the Mexican 
economy.

<F P=106> [By Jonathan Ewing] </F>
  [Text] Mogadishu, Dec 27 (AFP) -- A dynamite blast ripped 
through the area around Mogadishu port at dawn Monday, leveling 
shops and tea stalls and tearing down a section of wall around 
the port. 
  A United Nations spokesman said no one was hurt in the 
explosion, caused by an estimated 18 sticks of dynamite, 
according to military officials. "Our concern is that we do not 
return to the kind of mine laying that we saw in August through 
October," said UN military spokesman Major Tim McDavitt. 
  UN officials said the blast could have been in retaliation 
for the killing of a Somali by U.S. Army sharpshooters who 
opened fire on a vehicle carrying a machine gun on Sunday. 
Another Somali was wounded in the incident, the first involving 
U.S. troops for several weeks. 
  The radio of factional leader Mohammed Farah Aideed said two 
Somalis were killed in Sunday's shooting, but there was no 
independent confirmation. Officials of Aideed's faction 
disclaimed responsibility for the explosion. 
  A senior aide of General Aideed, Issa Mohamed Siad, said the 
warlord's Somali National Alliance faction was still bound by a 
cease-fire signed in March in Addis Ababa. "We are committed to 
honor the cease-fire signed earlier this year, but you must know 
that there are many people who are not controlled by us," Issa 
said. 
  Issa hinted that Aideed's enemy and rival factional leader 
Ali Mahdi Mohamed could have been behind the blast. "I think 
that Ali Mahdi Mohamed and UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] are 
trying to say to the world that there will be chaos in Mogadishu 
after U.S. troops depart, but there will be no chaos, at least 
not from us," Issa told reporters. 
  A senior UN military official said, "The explosion may have 
been an act of retaliation for the Sunday shooting, as if to say 
quit blowing our guys away -- we still have this capability." 
  Somali residents said they did not know who was responsible 
for the blast. "We don't know who did this, maybe it was the 
U.S. forces of UNOSOM (the U.N. Operation in Somalia)," said 
Ndifa Omar, a local businessman.

Issa Mohamed Siad, the United Somali Congress foreign affairs 
secretary, today said the Somali National Alliance [SNA] 
supporters were not responsible for anything that could bring 
about insecurity and problems. Mr. Issa Mohamed Siad said the 
individuals who always told about the impending civil war after 
the foreign troops departure from Somalia were behind the 
explosion that occurred at the Mogadishu port. He said the SNA 
officials and supporters wished the American troops and others a 
safe departure from the country. Elmi Osman Farah, our reporter 
who filed this report, also adds that Prof. Mohamed Siad called 
on the SNA supporters to be vigilant against such a conspiracy.

  [Text] Johannesburg Dec 30 SAPA -- A caller identifying 
himself as a commander of the Azanian National Liberation Army 
(Azanla) on Thursday claimed responsibility for an explosion 
which damaged a block of flats in Port Elizabeth's Swartkops 
industrial area shortly after midnight on Tuesday. There were 
no injuries. 
  Shortly after the Tuesday blast, police found large amounts 
of explosives in several places at a block of flats in Algoa 
Park, about 15km from Swartkops. Officers said at the time 
police were investigating a possible link between the blast and 
the explosives seized. The caller said the sabotage was part of 
Azanla's campaign for the complete liberation of all Azanians. 
"The struggle will continue until we are all free." 
  There was no way of independently confirming the caller was 
from Azanla, armed wing of the Black Consciousness Movement of 
Azania, which has rejected the constitutional deal reached in 
negotiations at Kempton Park.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 27 Dec (AFP) -- A Zairian political 
leader, Valentin Lubuma, was assassinated on 25 December by 
unidentified uniformed men, it was learned here today. [see 
SELECTED VIDEO REPORTS in front of Terrorism Report for TV 
footage] 
  Valentin Lubuma, a leading member of the Unified Lumumbist 
Party [PALU] and adviser at the Audit Office, was driving a car 
when three uniformed men riding in a "Korando" jeep blocked his 
path and, according to witnesses, asked him for money and other 
objects he had on him. To prevent him from possibly resisting, 
the three armed men each shot at the political leader and fled 
in his vehicle. 
  The assassination of this former permanent secretary of Mr. 
Antoine Gizenga, president of the Republic of Eastern Congo in 
Kisangani in 1964, occurred a few hours after a peaceful 
demonstration that was organized in Kinshasa by PALU members.

  [Text] The 10th hijacked passenger plane belonging to a PRC 
airlines landed at Taoyuan Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Airport at 1413 
local time [0613 GMT] this afternoon. Airport police have 
learned the two hijackers are male and female. The male is 
named (Luo Chang-hu) and the female is known as (Wang I-yin). 
Claiming that they carried explosives, they demanded that 
Fuchien [Fujian] Airlines' (?Flight FC-518) bound from 
Chianghsi's [Jiangxi] Kanchou [Ganzhou] for Hsiamen [Xiamen] be 
diverted to Taiwan. There are 50 people on board, including 
eight crew members and 42 passengers. The plane was hijacked at 
1312 local time. Our Air Force immediately learned of the 
hijacking. Because the Chinese communists' Yun-7 aircraft is 
similar to military aircraft, our Air Force adopted serious 
precautionary measures. At 1422 local time, four F-5E's took 
off from Taiwan to guide the hijacked plane to Taoyuan CKS 
International Airport. Government officials have gone to the 
airport to handle the matter. According to Prime Minister Lien 
Chan and instructions from the Mainland Affairs Council, it is 
expected the government will adopt a new method for handling the 
hijacked plane.

  [Text] Taipei, Dec 28 (AFP)--[passage omitted] Another 
attempt to hijack a Chinese airliner to Taiwan failed only hours 
earlier when a hijacker was overpowered, the state-funded 
Broadcasting Corporation of China reported, citing Taipei 
airport sources. [passage omitted] 
  The hijacker's bomb turned out to be a vitamin can with 
three 
batteries, one nail and a matchbox inside, and wired with thin 
cable, said a government official. 
  The couple told police they had been forced to seek asylum 
after the Chinese communists demolished their house four months 
ago. 
  A government statement said Luo, holding the fake bomb in 
one 
hand, threatened the pilot while his wife showed a card on which 
was written "Go to Taiwan, or we will blow up the plane" to 
stewardess Zhang Wei. Pilot Zhen Shanming said he did not have 
enough fuel to fly to Taiwan, but agreed to do so after the 
hijacker threatened to detonate the device, the government 
statement said. 
  The earlier attempted hijacking reported by the Broadcasting 
Corporation of China occurred near the neutral line separating 
airspace between China and Taiwan. [passage omitted] 
  Tuesday's hijacking came only a day after China vowed to 
beef 
up security at its airports, which western experts consider to 
be lamentably poor. 
  Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of 
China 
(CAAC), Jiang Zhuping, said China would invest 200 million yuan 
($35 million) next year to build a series of safety facilities, 
including "defensive stockades surrounding airports and 
equipment for safety examinations and fire prevention." 
  Flight crew members will be "instructed to take action 
against hijackers," the report said, but only "on the supreme 
principle of ensuring the absolute safety of passengers and the 
planes," Jiang, quoted by the Xinhua news agency, said.

  [Excerpt] The 10th PRC airliner hijacked to Taiwan this 
year departed Taoyuan Chiang Kai-shek Airport for Hsiamen 
[Xiamen] at 1823 local time [1023 GMT]. Although our government 
reiterated that the principle of separately handling hijackers 
and airplanes would remain unchanged, this time around relevant 
units conducted a more thorough inspection of the airplane and 
the people on board. The airplane was kept on the ground longer 
than during the past nine hijackings, and was only allowed to 
depart four hours later. 
  The hijacked airplane was a Yun-7 mid-sized airliner bound 
from Kanchou [Ganzhou], Chianghsi [Jiangxi] to Hsiamen [Xiamen]. 
It was hijacked at 1310 local time [0510 GMT]. The hijackers 
are a married couple from Chianghsi; they brought along their 
daughter. The man is (Luo Chang-hu), the 38-year-old manager of 
the Nanfang Trading Company. The woman is (Wang I-yin), a 
34-year-old salesperson at a construction materials company.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A high level government 
official revealed that, if another mainland plane is hijacked to 
Taiwan in the future, our side will not rule out the possibility 
of forced repatriation of hijackers or detaining the entire crew 
to put direct pressure on the CPC. Now let us hear the entire 
course of the plane hijacking yesterday. The following is a 
report by Chien Ting-yuan: 
  The hijacked plane belongs to Fujian Airlines of the CPC 
with 
serial number Yun-7/3447. It was piloted by Captain Shen 
Shang-ming. The plane carried eight crew members and 42 
passengers, including three Taiwanese compatriots. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to suspect Luo Chang-hua, the Kanchou city 
government wantonly dismantled people's houses in the past 10 
years and his two houses were expropriated four months ago. He 
could not find appropriate authorities to make appeals and he 
felt discontented. Therefore, he decided to hijack an airplane. 
  [Begin recording, presumably Luo Chang-hua] Their action 
hurt the interests of hundreds of thousands of families. I did 
this to show them. In other words, I will request Taiwan, 
namely the legitimate government of China -- a government which 
advocates humanitarianism, freedom, and a legal system -- to 
demand the CPC authorities refrain from continuing their 
persecution of the people. They should protect the people. It 
is so written in the Constitution, but in fact the people cannot 
have such protection. [end recording] 
  Luo Chang-hua said that he spent 20 days planning the 
hijacking. He knew he might be repatriated. He said that even 
if he was repatriated he wanted to tell about this unreasonable 
fact to the Republic of China Government. Luo Chang-hua said 
that he carried iron nails with him and that he would commit 
suicide if his hijacking attempt was unsuccessful. He hoped 
that his young son could be handed over to his sister-in-law who 
is in Taiwan for care. [passage omitted] 
As to the little hijacker, Luo Wang-huan, he has already been 
handed over to Luo Chang-hua's sister-in-law, who is a resident 
of Taiwan, for care. 
  Regarding the 10th hijacking of a mainland airliner, our 
government intentionally lowered the official level in handling 
the case. Interior Minister Wu Po-hsiung made a formal 
statement in the capacity of convener of the policy group for 
dealing with disasters or damage to airplanes in nonmilitary 
airports and ships in nonmilitary ports. In his statement, he 
clearly stated that hijackers are considered people who 
illegally enter Taiwan and will not be allowed to apply for 
residence in Taiwan. The government will not rule out that at 
an appropriate time in the future, plane hijackers will be 
forcibly repatriated. Besides, our side also expressed that, in 
the future, we will more carefully investigate and interrogate 
people on-board hijacked planes. 
  This statement explains for the first time our government's 
clear stand that hijackers will not be allowed to apply for 
residence in Taiwan. Meanwhile, our side stressed that, in the 
future, we will make more prudent and detailed investigation and 
interrogation and may (?detain) people on hijacked planes.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Xie Yicheng: "Airport Boosts Security </F>
Checks"] 
  [Text] Long queues are commonplace at Beijing Capital 
International Airport's security gates now that all passengers 
flying to eight southeast coastal cities must have their bags 
searched. 
  The stringent measures are among several taken by the 
airport 
following the hijacking of several mainland jetliners to Taiwan 
this year. 
  The airport has expanded its list of articles banned from 
being carried onto airliners to include scissors, hair sprays 
and all kinds of knives. 
  The airport has enlarged its checkpoint staff from 200 in 
August to more than 260 people today. 
  "We are making efforts to upgrade our professional training 
to international standards," said Wang Zhengqing, head of the 
airport's security checkpoint. 
  A special training agency will be soon established and 
outfitted with advanced detection devices. 
  The airport had examined 7.18 million people and 22 million 
pieces of luggage by the end of November. It uncovered 12,200 
pieces of contraband including 61 firearms, 551 bullets and 268 
electric stun guns, police sticks and tear gas weapons, as well 
as confidential State papers, protected relics and animals. 
  "We keep two things in mind: To guarantee traveler safety 
and to improve service," Wang said. "But considering current 
conditions, it's not easy to tighten inspections while 
attempting to let travelers pass without a hitch." 
  Since carry-on bag searches were introduced in mid-November, 
the checkpoint has only been able to process three or four 
passengers each minute compared with eight or nine persons 
before. 
  During peak periods, the security check lines have caused 
overcrowding and flight delays. 
  "Yet the majority of travelers have been understanding and 
cooperative regarding our stringent check-in procedures," Wang 
said. 
  To speed inspections, the airport plans to add another two 
channels for domestic flights early next year. Currently, all 
four domestic and all three international security gates are 
being used.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec 25 KYODO -- The Justice Ministry's 
watchdog body on extremists said Saturday [25 December] that 
this year's 29 guerrilla acts by ultraleftists were more heinous 
and indiscriminate than in the past. 
  In an annual report on the domestic and international 
security situations, the Public Security Investigation Agency 
said the extremists escalated "indiscriminate" attacks against 
targets including national cultural treasures and 
state-designated national assets. 
  The report also cited guerrilla activities targeting the 
April visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko to the 
southernmost island of Okinawa and the March dispatch of a 
second Self-Defense force engineering contingent to Cambodia. 
  The report said ultrarightists have escalated activities 
against Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa after he voiced in his 
August policy speech remorse and apology to Asian people for 
atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers in World War II. 
  It said about 2,260 international guerrilla cases were 
reported, of which seven targeted Japanese people and companies. 
  The Public Security Investigation Agency, established in 
1952, collects intelligence on extremist groups in line with the 
1952 Antisubversive Activities Law which is designed to crack 
down on subversive groups.

  [Text] DAVAO, Philippines, Dec 26 (AFP) -- Three powerful 
explosions ripped through the San Pedro Cathedral in this 
southern Philippine city Sunday during a packed post-Christmas 
mass, killing at least four people and wounding more than 100 
others, police said. 
  Police said the explosions, which occured almost 
simultaneously at about 6:20 p.m. (1020 GMT), caused pandemonium 
among some 3,000 Roman Catholic church-goers present. Some of 
those hurt were injured in the stampede. 
  A fourth explosive device was found beside a pew near the 
altar and was detonated by bomb experts. 
  Davao police chief Superintendent Rogelio Abaday said that 
four people were killed, including 15-year-old Rachel Lu who 
died on the spot, and that 119 others were wounded, many 
seriously. He declined to comment on the suspects or any 
possible motive. 
  Restituta Plete, a candle vendor, told AFP said she was 
standing with her father and husband, Roberto, on the cathedral 
steps when they heard the explosion and saw a blinding flash of 
light. 
  Plete and her husband were wounded but her father, 
51-year-old Thomas Juliano, was killed. Tears welling in her 
eyes, she said doctors told her that her husband's feet might 
have to be amputated. 
  "I don't know what I will do now. We don't have any money. 
I'm appealing for help," Plete, in a local hospital, said. 
  Police said two of the explosions were apparently caused by 
homemade bombs and were attempting to verify witness reports 
that the third blast was caused by a grenade hurled by a youth 
who then fled. 
  The first bomb exploded five rows from the altar, the second 
near the parking lot at the rear. The third, believed to be the 
grenade, exploded in a middle row of the church. 
  "I was seated on the third pew from the altar when I heard a 
loud explosion," Sarah Sapun, 27, said from her hospital bed. 
"Immediately we ducked for cover. My husband covered me and my 
four-year-old son." Her husband was also wounded. 
  "I am grieving over what happened," said a shocked Davao 
Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, still clutching a child's slipper he had 
picked up. 
  In the blasts' aftermath debris such as bags, slippers, 
shoes 
and seats littered the church and outside. 
  Residents living near the downtown cathedral, which is near 
police headquarters, also panicked. 
  Some clambered atop passing mini-buses to get away from the 
scene while others ran for safety or sought cover. 
  Abaday ordered stepped-up police patrols in the city and all 
exits were sealed to prevent the suspects from escaping a police 
dragnet.

  [Text] Another bombing incident occurred at dawn in a 
Muslim mosque in Davao City. The incident was allegedly the 
work of two men riding a motor bike. The two men reportedly 
threw an M-203 grenade. There were no reports of anyone killed 
or injured at the scene. The incident happened at about 3:30 
a.m. Government authorities cannot determine if the incident is 
related to another grenade throwing incident, which happened at 
a cathedral also in Davao City.

  [Text] Pagadian City -- At least 10 persons were blasted 
to death, while some 25 others were seriously wounded when a 
grenade believed hurled by members of the New People's Army 
(NPA) exploded in an overcrowded public market in Barangay 
[village] Bagumbang, Bonifacio town, Misamis Occidental at 2 
p.m. yesterday. 
  A sketchy police report received here said six died on the 
spot, while four others expired on the way to hospitals. 
  The report identified only three of the fatalities. They 
were Inday Monteramos, Undo Saguin, and a certain "Dodong." 
  The wounded were taken to government hospitals in Ozamiz 
City 
and Tangub City, some 40 and 25 kilometers, respectively, north 
of Bonifacio town. 
  Misamis Occidental Representative Hilario Ramiro Jr., a 
resident of Ozamiz City, led government hospital staff in 
attending to the wounded, some of whom were given a 50/50 chance 
to survive.

  [Excerpt] President Fidel Valdez Ramos called for a 
meeting between Muslim and Christian leaders to stem escalating 
religious violence in Mindanao. Also invited were government 
officials and security forces. 
  Earlier, an unidentified man bombed two mosques, apparently 
in retaliation for the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral in 
Davao City, southern Philippines. In the Davao blast, six 
persons were killed while some 130 others were wounded. The 
other explosion was in Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental on 
Christmas Eve, killing five persons and injuring about 40 others. 
  AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Chief of Staff 
Lisandro 
Abadia says the spate of bombings in Mindanao could be the 
handiwork of some extremists group out to derail the peace 
process. 
  Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front, 
MNLF, strongly deplored the bombing incident in Davao City last 
Sunday. Misuari issued this strongly worded statement during 
yesterday's meeting of the joint ad hoc technical working 
committee of both the government panel and the MNLF in 
Timbangan, Indanan, Jolo. In condemning the attacks, Misuari 
said the bombings of different places are deplorable and 
cowardly acts. He said, it is also a blasphemy which the MNLF 
will never allow or condone. [passage omitted on government

  [Text] The breakaway groups of the Communist Party of the 
Philippines [CPP] have been accused of deception because of 
their continued use of the name Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB]. 
This accusation came from Gregorio Rosal, alias Comrade Roger, 
spokesman for the Militor Glor Command. 
  [Begin correspondent Norie Temblor recording] In an 
exclusive 
interview with GMA-7 at Sierra Madre, Rosal said that the 
breakaway factions lost the right to use the name Alex Boncayao 
Brigade after they broke off ties with the Communist Party of 
the Philippines. It will be recalled that many CPP units headed 
by the NCR [National Capital Region] regional party committee 
cut their ties with CPP Chairman Jose Maria Sison. In this 
connection, Rosal said they will reactivate the real Alex 
Boncayao Brigade to counter the impostor ABB. 
  Regarding the coming peace talks, Rosal revealed that the 
CPP 
remains open to the peace talks. In the meantime, Rosal called 
on Ramos to give more attention to the important issues in the 
peace talks rather than focusing on the issue of giving Sison a 
passport. 
  On the ongoing cease-fire, Rosal disclosed that they have 
not 
committed any violations. 
  Meanwhile, government troops continue their intensive 
surveillance of suspected New People's Army camps. [end

  [Text] The Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] has 
strongly criticized the continued operation of the Alex Boncayao 
Brigade [ABB] in Metro Manila. According to Gregorio Rosal, 
alias Comrade Roger, head of the CPP Information Bureau, this 
liquidation squad was dismantled and disarmed in December last 
year. He reiterated that the current ABB is illegal and is not 
recognized by the hierarchy of the CPP-NPA [New People's Army]. 
It is allegedly supported by the breakaway group of the Metro 
Manila-Rizal Regional Committee under the leadership of Felimon 
Lagman, alias Carlos Forte. The ABB was recently involved in 
the robbery of a truck loaded with rice in Binondo, Manila.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Dec (NA) -- Electricity Department 
Secretary Carlos Bastos reported today that the electricity cuts 
recorded on 28 December in different points of the country were 
caused by sabotage to the power lines coming from the El Chocon 
and Salto Grande hydroelectric dams. 
  Bastos said that to repair the lines a program of rotational 
cuts of between 20 and 30 minutes has been prepared. 
  In a news conference Bastos explained that last night, 
between 1945 and 2120, three different acts of sabotage were 
carried out on the power lines coming from the El Chocon and 
Salto Grande dams, leaving some 800,000 people in this capital 
and an unspecified number of inhabitants in the country's 
interior without electricity. 
  Since repairing the damage will require between 24 and 48 
hours, a plan of cuts in electricity service during "peak" 
consumption hours had to be implemented. Bastos denied that the 
cuts could be extended until 31 December. 
  The secretary said the energy supply through a line that 
links the Salto Grande hydroelectric dam with the locality of 
Santo Tome, Corrientes Province, was interrupted at 1945 on 28 
December. When the failure was investigated, it was discovered 
that it was caused by a chain thrown on the high-tension power 
line. 
  Later, at 2020, a second sabotage was carried out, this time 
on a pylon for a power line from El Chocon, in a place called 
Unanue, near the intersection of National Route 35 and 
Provincial Route 215, La Pampa Province. 
  In this manner, the power supply was cut from one of the 
lines that link the dam with the cities of Puelches (La Pampa) 
and Henderson (Buenos Aires). 
  An hour later, at 2120, a third attack was recorded only 12 
km from the site, on the other high-tension power line that runs 
parallel to the first. 
  Bastos said that although the reasons are not known so far, 
he did not rule out the possibility that the objective of these 
attacks might be the "disruption of the development of events in 
the energy field or the total political environment" in the 
country. 
  "So far we have no evidence to attribute the responsibility 
for these attacks, but we fully rule out that they could have 
been instigated by Light and Power Union leaders," Bastos said. 
  He added: "Since the repair work will demand between 24 and 
48 hours by the Transener company, it is probable that 
rotational cuts will take place during peak hours, affecting 2 
percent of the demand." 
  The plan for cuts has been imposed because "since the links 
with the generating plants are cut, the distribution companies 
are restricting the supply to preserve the system."

<F P=106> [Article by Gabriel Freire] </F>
  [Text] The "Raul Pellegrin" detachment, an offshoot of the 
Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR), was crippled for all 
practical purposes following the arrest by the Investigations 
branch of its three top leaders, the military, political, and 
logistics chiefs. Seven other persons were also captured in the 
police operation, as well as a sizable arsenal which was 
examined yesterday, 25 November, by prosecutor Humberto Espejo. 
  The persons arrested were identified as Esteban Burgos 
Torrealba, military chief; Alejandro Placencia Urrutia, 
logistics chief; and Ariel Saenz Bont-Martens, political chief. 
Also arrested were a married couple, Luis Emilio Lopez Sandoval 
and Iris Galleguillos Donoso, and Claudia Mella Mateluna, 
Gabriel Venegas Escorza, Leslie Maxwel Narvaez, Jacqueline 
Navarette Mellado, and Paola Orlando Orlando. 
  According to a senior civil police official, the police 
operation was the culmination of extensive intelligence work 
that began last June with the arrest of Jose Saa [sic] Gerbier, 
30 years of age, the top leader of the extremist movement. 
  After obtaining as much information as possible from the 
interrogation of Saa Gerbier, units of Intelligence and of the 
Second Assault Police Station raided four residences on the 
night of 23-24 November, located at Neptuno 101, Pudahuel; Cabo 
de Hornos 0545, Maipu; Pasaje Salitre Peregrino 0882, Puente 
Alto, and Pasaje Corcega 940, La Cisterna. 
  In the first three, the police seized handguns and 
shoulder-fired weapons, and at La Cisterna they captured an 
extensive arsenal that included LAW rocket launchers. 
  Following the arrest of Saa Gerbier, the government 
requested 
a visit by a prosecutor to investigate the subversive 
organization. The prosecutor designated was Magistrate Humberto 
Espejo Zuniga who, after a 10-day period of detention for the 
presumed extremists, conducted a visual inspection yesterday of 
the house at La Cisterna followed by an inspection of the 
captured weapons and explosives at the main offices of 
Investigations. 
  Espejo described the quantity of armaments that the group 
possessed as impressive, when asked about the result of the 
police operations. As to their eventual use, he said that it was 
"evidently for a terrorist plan. We cannot guess what they 
planned to do, but there is no doubt that they were destined for 
terrorist acts." 
  When asked whether documents with specific plans were found, 
he said "no, because these people rarely keep written planning 
records. It must be understood that these are terrorist 
organizations and the chiefs think about what they are going to 
do, at most they will write down some information, an address, 
but they never write down plans." 
  As for crimes that might be attributed to the group, the 
prosecutor said that "approximately 24 high voltage towers have 
been blown up since last year, which is what started this 
investigation. That is for what concerns terrorist acts, but 
there is also a very large number of crimes for gain, about 32 
or 33 crimes, robberies of banks, finance offices, and 
supermarkets. A guard was killed, and there could be some 
connection with the death of a gendarme." (Jose Cortes, on 11 
October, in the motor vehicle section of the Gendarmeria.) 
  He said that this group was an offshoot of the FPMR and that 
"the size of the band" was being investigated, that there was no 
evidence to indicate that this was the group that had freed 
Maritza Jara, on trial for the kidnapping of Cristian Edwards 
del Rio, from San Miguel prison. 
  The "Raul Pellegrin" detachment, which came into being in 
1991 as a result of the breakup of the FPMR, subscribes to the 
thesis of the armed revolution. Its leader uses the name of 
"Commander Rodrigo" in memory of the leader found dead together 
with Cecilia Magni in the mountains of the Seventh Region, 
following the attack on the village of Los Quenes in 1987, in 
which the carabineer Juvenal Vargas was killed. 
<H5>  [Box, p 14] </H5>
<H5>  Arms and Explosives Captured </H5>
  In the residence at Pasaje Salitre Peregrino 0882, Puente 
Alto, the police seized an SHE submachine gun, model P 25, 9 mm 
Parabellum, and two Llama revolvers, Comanche model, .38 caliber 
special. There were also three magazines for the submachine gun 
with a capacity of 40 rounds each, and a large quantity of 
ammunition for the revolvers. 
  In Neptune 101, Pudahuel, police seized a Rossi .38 caliber 
special revolver, a large quantity of ammunition for the weapon, 
and a 50 mm anti-aircraft round. 
  In Cabo de Hornos 0545, Maipu, police found a Spanish 
grenade, a revolver and a CZ pistol, 9 mm short, and ammunition 
for both weapons. There were also two detonators, one with 15 
centimeters of black fuse. 
  Finally, in Corcega 940, La Cisterna, police found an 
extensive arsenal consisting of more than 15 kg of paint grade 
aluminum powder, used for making homemade bombs; ammonium 
nitrate; potassium chlorite; laminating powder; 300 meters of 
detonating cord at 10 grams per meter, which is also an 
explosive; homemade detonators; a large number of booby traps, 
T4 explosive plastic, electric-type detonators, seven LAW's with 
their rockets, all live or in working order; seven M-16 rifles 
with a large quantity of ammunition, approximately 30 magazines 
with 30 rounds in each one; sawed off shotguns, revolvers, and 
electric detonators. 
  When asked about the destructive power of this arsenal, the 
chief of the Ballistics Department of Investigations said that 
"if we only consider the damage that a LAW rocket can do, we 
have a warlike arsenal able to cause damage of an incalculable 
magnitude. If we add to this the firepower of the M-16's and the 
amount of ammunition seized, we cannot measure the consequences."

  [Text] Santiago, 26 Dec (EFE) -- A police report released 
today states that a very powerful bomb was thrown on 25 December 
at a Finandes financial company office in the stock exchange 
district of the Chilean city of Valparaiso, 125 km northwest of 
Santiago. It did not cause any casualties. 
  The explosion occurred at about 0400, substantially damaging 
windows and doors as well as causing minor damage to nearby 
offices, including those of the Belgian consulate. 
  Police sources have reported that no extremist group has so 
far claimed the attack. 
  The sources added that patrolling of malls was increased 
during the Christmas period following the discovery of fire 
bombs installed in teddy bears in a mall in Santiago and in a 
shop in southern Chile. 
  The militarized Carabineros police have reported that 14 
people were killed in traffic accidents, including seven 
pedestrians who were run over, during the Christmas celebrations.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Dec (EFE) -- More than 200 houses 
in Soleil neighborhood were burned today by members of the 
extreme right-wing "Front for Haiti's Advancement and Progress 
(FRAPH)" in an incident that produced at least several dead and 
injured. 
  FRAPH members, accompanied by soldiers in uniform, sought to 
"avenge" the murder of businessman Issa Paul, treasurer of their 
organization in Soleil. His burned body was found this morning. 
FRAPH members burned the houses of people they believe could be 
linked to Paul's murder. Although it is presumed that there are 
several dead as a result of the FRAPH attack, Haitian radio only 
confirmed two. Representatives of FRAPH, an organization that 
became public when the return of constitutional President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide was being negotiated, even captured 
citizens. The soldiers in uniform did not intervene and 
appeared to be protecting FRAPH members, the radio reported. 
  FRAPH is made up of armed civilians, mostly former members 
of 
the Tonton Macoutes (paramilitary police) that existed during 
the Duvalier administration.

  [Text] According to a report issued by the Institute for 
National Defense Research (Iniden), the activity of the 
terrorist groups Shining Path and MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] throughout the country has decreased by 
nearly 60 percent in November as compared to October. 
  According to the study Iniden conducts every month, the 
figures give obvious evidence of Shining Path's weakening 
condition. 
  The report says that the main reasons behind this weakening 
are the constant deployment of security forces and the outburst 
of violence in September, the first anniversary of Abimael 
Guzman Reinoso's capture. 
  There were 19 deaths as the result of terrorist actions 
during November, while in October there were 70 victims. 
  This means that deaths due to terrorism dropped by 85 
percent. Most incidents occurred in Lima, Ancash, and Huanuco 
Departments. 
  A total of 478 individuals lost their lives as a result of 
the political violence in the country during the year. 
  The collapse of Shining Path terrorism is visible in the 
Upper Huallaga region (San Martin-Huanuco). In that region 202 
of President "Gonzalo's" followers recently surrendered under 
the terms of the Repentance Law. 
  Iniden reports that last month the police captured 240 
alleged terrorists who were later sent to the appropriate police 
departments for further investigation. A considerable number of 
terrorists were sent to Lima and other regional jails. 
  It is estimated that there are 600,000 displaced people 
throughout the country. In Ayacucho, 52,500 families left their 
homes and lands as a result of terrorist violence; in Junin 
17,000 families had to leave their homes; in Huancavelica 14,500 
families left the region; and in Apurimac 13,000 moved out for 
the same reason. 
  A good number of these families have begun to return to 
their 
lands as a result of the decreasing level of violence.

  [Editorial Report] Following are reports on insurgent 
activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian papers published on 11 
December. 
  The National Counterterrorism Directorate on 18 November 
arrested Shining Path "terrorist" Edison Tomas Zarate Untiveros, 
23, in Lima's La Victoria District. He carried ammunition, 
"subversive" literature, and handwritten notes. He had sought 
refuge in Argentina, from where he returned to Peru at the 
request of People's Aid of Peru to head its defense department's 
military command and to prepare car bombs for the organization. 
Zarate reportedly was involved in car bombs that exploded 
between September and November. Police also arrested six other 
Shining Path "terrorists" during operations in Lima between 24 
November and 2 December. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 11 Dec 93

  [Text] Three hundred Shining Path terrorists, confined in 
the Miguel Castro Castro prison and grouped under the 
self-styled "Canto Grande Shining Combat Trench," have issued a 
communique accepting Abimael Guzman Reinoso's and Elena 
Iparraguirre's decision to negotiate a peace agreement with the 
government. 
  In their communique, the subversives, who describe 
themselves 
as "prisoners of war," note: "We support, voluntarily submit 
to, and endorse (...) the letters that President Gonzalo and 
Comrade Miriam sent to the president of the Republic, engineer 
Alberto Fujimori Fujimori." 
  The terrorists specifically indicate that they support "the 
talks to reach a peace agreement, whose implementation involves 
ending a 13-year-old war in our country." 
  Emphasizing their identification with Abimael Guzman's 
leadership, the imprisoned Maoists stress that the Peruvian 
Communist Party-Shining Path's [PCP-SL] new slogan now is: 
"Struggle for a Peace Agreement!" 
  Apparently, it involves a group of subversives who disagree 
with the leaders who have replaced Guzman and his followers 
because in their communique the imprisoned Shining Path 
subversives note: "The PCP wants peace and no more 
provocations," hinting at the attacks that shocked our capital 
during recent weeks, including a long blackout and the explosion 
of car bombs. 
  According to police reports, Shining Path hard-liners, led 
by 
Oscar Ramirez Durand, Ostap Morote Barrionuevo, Teresa Duran 
Araujo, and others, are opposed to surrender and, with the 
assistance of those Shining Path armed units that have not been 
hit and are prepared to carry out terrorist actions, pursue 
their plans because "the people's war does not end with the 
decision of one man; the people's war is a historic necessity 
dictated by the laws of society." 
  Outside our country, Luis Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechea 
Cahuas, who are making propaganda for the Shining Path in 
Brussels and London, respectively, have said the laying down of 
arms is "a hoax, a government maneuver." They stressed that the 
PCP-SL will not surrender. 
  Arce Borja and Olaechea Cahuas based their viewpoint on some 
remarks made by Abimael Guzman Reinoso in July 1988. In his 
remarks, Guzman Reinoso said the talks "are just aimed at 
undermining and destroying the people's war." 
  Shortly after Guzman's capture, the Shining Path terrorists 
who replaced the arrested and killed leaders released a poster 
in which they stressed that the fight would continue: "The 
party's leadership may have disappeared, but the remaining 
leaders must and can pursue the plans, the struggle, the 
people's war. We are firmly convinced that the revolution will 
not stop, will not be paralyzed." 
  Nevertheless, the communique issued by the Shining Path 
terrorists imprisoned in Canto Grande, which apparently is a 
majority group since the opinion of the rebellious group [within 
the Shining Path] remains unknown, leaves the leadership that 
insists on pursuing armed actions without important support. 
  The self-styled "Canto Grande Shining Combat Trench's 
prisoners of war," including the perpetrators of the most 
shocking attacks and selective crimes, stress: "We reaffirm our 
highest and unconditional submission to the single leadership of 
President Gonzalo and the party's central directorate." 
  In his letters to the president last October, Abimael Guzman 
said: "Peace has been achieved to meet a people's need. 
Yesterday we struggled to wage a people's war. Today, with 
equal firmness and resolve, we must struggle to achieve a peace 
agreement." 
  For several weeks, the Miguel Castro Castro Maoists had 
their 
doubts about the authenticity of the letters and a video in 
which Guzman reads the letters while Elena Iparraguirre, 
"Comrade Miriam," watches him closely. 
  After long discussions, however, the Miguel Castro Castro 
Maoists finally reached a majority agreement and signed an 
undated communique in which they decide "to close ranks in this 
new period of our party's life and the contemporary Peruvian 
society's life." 
  Miguel Castro Castro is one of our country's most 
sophisticated penitentiaries. The largest group of our 
country's terrorists are confined there, with the exception of 
the Yanamayo penitentiary in Puno Department where top PCP-SL 
leaders such as Martha Huatay Ruiz, Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, 
Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Maria Pantoja, and others are confined.

  [Text] Lima, 25 Dec (NOTIMEX) -- A car bomb explosion, 
which occurred this evening in front of La Polvora Military 
Barracks, located 3 km from the presidential palace in eastern 
Lima, injured six people, Peruvian police reported today. 
  The explosion, which was part of a series of dynamite 
attacks 
that occurred on the eve of Chinese leader Mao Ze Dong's 
centennial--which the rebel group, the Shining Path, threatened 
to celebrate by executing a series of violent actions--destroyed 
three houses and injured five members of a family and a passerby. 
  Security forces have reported that a man and a woman, 
presumably involved in the attack, were arrested in the vicinity.

  [Text] Lima, 28 Dec (EFE) -- Alleged members of the 
terrorist group Shining Path, on Tuesday, detonated two car 
bombs near the Prefecture (Civilian Government) of Lima, causing 
a great deal of damage and killing at least one policeman, 
although the death has not been officially confirmed. Another 
nine policemen and at least 20 civilians were injured. 
  The homes in front of the Prefecture, which is on Espana 
Avenue in the area near the U.S. Embassy and the Sheraton Hotel, 
were totally destroyed and are now uninhabitable. 
  The shock wave destroyed stores, businesses, and banks on 
Alfonso Ugarte Avenue, which is perpendicular to Espana Avenue. 
  The terrorists detonated one car bomb against the Prefecture 
from Alfonso Ugarte Avenue. The explosion at 0545 local (1045 
GMT) destroyed a police armored personnel carrier in which human 
remains were seen. It is therefore presumed that at least one 
policeman died inside. 
  Another car bomb was detonated near the Prefecture at the 
corner of Alfonso Ugarte and Bolivia Avenues. 
  Seven injured policemen, some in serious condition, were 
sent 
to the Lima Police hospital. 
  Approximately 200 policemen have been mobilized to protect 
the area and search out the attackers.

<F P=106> [Report by Rocio Vicente and Mabel Valenzuela; from the </F>
"Newspaper of the Airways" newscast] 
  [Text] Vicente and Valenzuela are five blocks away from 
our radio station, behind RTP Television, at the Peruvian Air 
Force Funeral Home, which was hit by an explosion. Some people 
could have died. Let us listen to Rocio Vicente: 
  [Vicente] It has been confirmed that two people have died as 
a result of the terrorist attack near RTP Television. We are 
here with a lady. What happened? 
  [Unidentified speaker] There had been threats [words 
indistinct]. That funeral home belongs to the Air Force and the 
one on the corner is the Navy's. They are constantly receiving 
threats. We are only residents of this neighborhood. We had 
been told to be careful, because there had been threats; these 
threats had been reported, but the funeral home was never 
protected. We live in Tepun. 
  [Vicente] This woman was one of the victims. She was injured 
by the explosion at the Air Force Funeral Home, which was the 
site most damaged by the explosion. The explosion completely 
destroyed several vehicles. There are broken windows and some 
walls are about to collapse. Mabel Valenzuela is at another 
area of the site of the explosion. Go ahead, Mabel: 
  [Valenzuela] We are with some doctors from the Social 
Security Institute Field Hospital. How many people have you 
cared for, doctor? 
  [Unidentified speaker] The Field Hospital arrived here two 
minutes after the explosion. We arrived with two ambulances and 
tended to six patients, two of whom are Air Force members. 
These two patients have been taken to the Peruvian Air Force 
Hospital by request from Intelligence [word indistinct]. 
  [Valenzuela] What about the others? 
  [Doctor] Some have been sent to Revaliate Hospital, and the 
rest were examined here and released. 
  [Valenzuela] You went inside the building. Could there be 
people in there? There are reports that two people died. 
  [Unidentified speaker] We are here in case there are more 
injured people to take away. We are ready for any incident. 
  [Valenzuela] Thank you, doctor. More firemen and Social 
Security Institute people are arriving to back up those already 
here. High-ranking Air Force officers have just arrived. They 
are making no statement and are entering the damaged building. 
  [Vicente] The situation at Giron Torres Paz, in Santa 
Beatriz 
Neighborhood, a few meters away from RTP Television, is still 
tense. Firemen are continuing to give attention to the injured. 
We do not yet have the name of the person who died, but 
according to initial police reports, the victim could be a girl. 
She has already been covered with a sheet. The police and the 
Air Force are maintaining absolute silence.

  [Text] Lima, 29 Dec (DPA) -- The office of a 
non-governmental organization suffered slight damage in Lima 
today as a result of an attack attributed to the Maoist Shining 
Path. 
  Several subversives planted a package containing explosives 
under the door of the Center for Population Promotion and 
Development [Centro de Promocion y Desarrollo Poblacional -- 
Ceprodep] the explosion of which caused slight damage to the 
main door and windows of the building and to 20 nearby houses. 
  Sociologist Carlos Tapia, who is in charge of Ceprodep, 
regretted the attack that was apparently perpetrated by Shining 
Path members. 
  This is the fourth Shining Path attack since 28 December. 
The attacks have claimed one dead civilian and 36 injured, 
including 10 policemen and two soldiers, and have caused heavy 
structural damage.

<F P=106> [Article by Mirna Mendoza] </F>
  [Excerpts] Judge Hector Marcano Batistini, in charge of the 
18th Superior Criminal Court, has revoked the arrest warrant 
that had been issued against Thor Halvorssen, accused of being 
the mastermind behind a car bomb and financial terrorism case. 
  As you may recall, 42d Criminal Court Judge Oscar Vera 
Sandoval, who was in charge of the proceedings, issued an arrest 
warrant against Halvorssen, former president of the CANTV 
[National Telephone Company of Venezuela] and former 
presidential commissioner of the Republic, as well as against 
other people indicted in this case, including Ramiro Francisco 
Helmeyer Oquendo. 
  The case was turned over to a higher court where 18th 
Superior Court Judge Hector Marcano Batistini had to modify or 
ratify the sentence handed down by the lower court. Dr. 
Batistini announced his decision yesterday and just as expected, 
Halvorssen was released early this morning. Halvorssen, who had 
been confined for approximately two months in El Junquito 
Judicial Penitentiary, abandoned the prison, accompanied by his 
lawyers Luis Lugo and Vicente Puppio. [passage omitted] 
  Vicente Puppio and Luis Lugo, who defended Thor Halvorssen, 
made statements as soon as they learned of Judge Marcano 
Batistini's decision. Puppio spoke first, explaining that "we 
always said that Halvorssen was innocent, as has been confirmed 
by the decision of the 18th Superior Court judge." Halvorssen 
was released, but we have to note that the judge of the 18th 
Criminal Tribunal left the investigation open. [passage omitted] 
  Luis Lugo said that there is still an investigation pending 
on the case, "but that Halvorssen regained his total freedom." 
  At 1145 Thor Halvorssen left El Junquito penitentiary, after 
the papers for his release were taken to the prison in 
compliance with the judicial order. 
  Upon leaving he said that the decision shows that justice 
still prevails in Venezuela. He also reiterated his claim of 
innocence. He asked to be allowed to meet with his family and 
promised to hold a news conference in the coming days to explain 
his position and to report publicly about the irregular 
situation.

  [Text] Quito, 24 Dec (DPA) -- The 17 December ambush 
executed by Colombian guerrillas against an Ecuadoran military 
patrol--which left 11 soldiers killed, 12 wounded, and two 
missing--was aimed at DEA agents. [see previous Terrorism Report 
for incident reports] 
  "We were mistaken for DEA agents," said one of the two 
Ecuadoran soldiers who were captured after the ambush by the 
"32d column of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC)" and were released hours later, "when they realized it 
was a mistake." 
  The kidnappers, approximately 30 guerrillas between the ages 
of 14 and 20, reportedly said they were mistaken because "this 
area is where the DEA mostly operates," in reference to the 
Amazon jungle stretch of the Ecuadoran-Colombian border. 
  At the Putumayo River, seven Ecuadoran military launches 
were 
ambushed by approximately 200 FARC guerrillas who fled into the 
dense jungle where they are being pursued on both sides of the 
border. 
  Press reports on the alleged capture of at least three 
Colombian guerrillas has not yet been confirmed by the Ecuadoran 
Army, although Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo said on 22 
December that "we are following the tracks" of members of the 
FARC's "32d Column." 
  The account of soldier Segundo Chamba reportedly confirmed 
reports that FARC guerrillas and drug-trafficking rings linked 
to the two largest Colombian cartels are operating jointly in 
southern Colombia. 
  The guerrillas who captured the two Ecuadoran soldiers did 
not explain the reasons why they tried to aim their attack 
against the DEA, whose agents are reportedly solely involved in 
fighting drug trafficking and are not participating in 
antisubversive operations. 
  The day after the attack, Ecuador intensified security along 
its border to prevent new guerrilla incursions while the Army 
elite forces started to pursue the attackers.

  [Text] The newspaper AL-SAFIR reports that Lebanese 
security authorities have uncovered a terrorist ring working for 
the Israeli intelligence agency, Mosad. The ring planned to 
assassinate high-ranking Lebanese officials to destabilize the 
country and embarrass Syria ahead of the Syrian-U.S. summit. 
  AL-SAFIR reports that one ring member who was arrested 
recently was tasked with assassinating a high-ranking official. 
The authorities have also foiled a plan to assassinate a 
minister and a senior military official. 
  Citing well-informed sources, AL-SAFIR says the Israel 
agencies and another, non-Israeli, party have drawn up a plan to 
weaken Syria's position. They want to weaken President 
al-Asad's position ahead of the Geneva summit with President 
Clinton. So they planned to embarrass him in Lebanon. 
  This information follows Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's recent visit to the occupied border strip and his veiled 
threats against Lebanon and Syria.

  [Text] Amman, Dec 25 (AFP)--An Islamic Resistance Movement 
(Hamas) spokesman on Saturday denied that the Muslim 
fundamentalist group had offered to halt attacks on Jewish 
settlers, describing its reported ceasefire as an Israeli "hoax." 
  A Hamas representative in Amman, Muhammad Nazzal, told AFP: 
"The ceasefire announcement is not true, and the proof is the 
killing on Friday of an Israeli colonel." 
  Israeli army officials said Lieutenant-Colonel Meir Mintz, 
gunned down in the occupied Gaza Strip on Friday, was the most 
senior officer ever killed by Hamas. 
  The military wing of Hamas in the occupied territories, 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, claimed responsibility for the attack, in 
which a Palestinian passerby was also killed and three soldiers 
were wounded. 
  In a statement which appeared in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, 
Hamas announced for the first time a three-day halt to attacks 
on Jewish settlers, to give Israel a chance to reciprocate. 
  However, it said the struggle against the Israeli Army would 
continue. 
  Nazzal said Israelis hatched the ceasefire statement in a 
bid 
to "create chaos and uncertainty among Hamas fighters in the 
occupied territories." 
  Meanwhile, another Hamas spokesman in Amman, Ibrahim 
Ghawshah, said Hamas was seeking to clinch 40 percent of the 
leadership of the "Palestinian Forces Alliance," grouping 10 
factions opposed to the Israel-PLO autonomy deal. 
  "Our draft formula favors a 50-member central leadership: 40 
percent for Hamas, 40 percent for the other nine factions and 20 
percent for independents," Ghawshah told AFP. 
  He said it was the same ratio as that demanded by Hamas 
three 
years ago as a condition for joining the Palestine National 
Council (PNC), the Palestinian parliament-in-exile. 
  Other opposition groups, including the Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) and the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), favored a 30-member central 
leadership, consisting of two representatives from each of the 
10 factions and 10 independents, said Ghawshah.

<F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] has revealed 
that it held contacts with Western officials and diplomats in 
London a few days ago with the aim of "suspending" military 
operations against the Israelis and to give the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement a chance to succeed. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas 
representative in Jordan, said that he "personally met with some 
of those Western diplomats and officials in the British capital." 
  To spare them embarrassment, Nazzal declined to give the 
names of the Western diplomats and officials with whom he met. 
  He said: The contacts revolved around Hamas's position on 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement and other developments in the 
occupied territories, especially the qualitative military 
operations that the movement carried out against the occupation 
troops and settlers. 
  Nazzal said that he explained to those officials that the 
movement has a clear position regarding the need to continue 
military action until the occupation is removed. 
  In response to a question on the Israeli occupation 
authorities' recent contacts with Hamas in the occupied 
territories, Nazzal said: These contacts were initiated by the 
Israeli side. They were held with some Hamas officials in 
Israeli prisons to convince them to ask Hamas leaders outside 
prison to halt military action. 
  Nazzal revealed that Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli 
delegation to the negotiations with the Palestinians on 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, is one of those who held such 
contacts. He stressed that Hamas has rejected those offers 
because the occupation, which is the justification for the 
continued military action, is still there. 
  In response to a question, Nazzal denied any contacts 
between 
Hamas and Israeli officials outside Israeli prisons. 
  On what has been reported about a cease-fire offered by 
Hamas, the Hamas representative said that the truth of this 
offer has been distorted by the Israeli mass media. He said the 
cease-fire was not comprehensive and final, but was for three 
days only and covers only the settlers. He noted that this 
ultimatum is over, and that the al-Qassam battalions have 
declared a resumption of military operations against the 
settlers. 
  In response to a question, Nazzal denied that the 10 
faction-bloc has broken up. He emphasized that the 10 factions 
will meet in Damascus on Thursday [31 December]. However, he 
admitted the existence of differences and various views 
regarding the organizational formula, which is currently under 
consideration. 
  He said: The 10-faction bloc will remain the minimum level 
through which the resistance to the occupation and to any 
agreement that relinquishes the Palestinian people's rights can 
continue. 
  He said: Hamas has every respect and appreciation for all 
its allies in the 10-faction coalition, but it does not want 
charges to be leveled against it by any of those allies through 
the media. 
  Nazzal hoped that a "brotherly spirit would prevail between 
Hamas and its allies." He stressed that "the points of 
agreement are more than the points of disagreement." 
  Nazzal criticized the "phenomenon of some Palestinian 
factions' claiming responsibility for some operations that have 
been carried out by the al-Qassam battalions, especially since 
the factions that claim responsibility for such operations are 
among the 10 factions." 
  It is noteworthy that some military operations in the 
occupied territories were claimed by both Hamas and the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The latest 
operation was the one in which two settlers were killed in 
Baytuniya near Ramallah.

elections won by the FIS two years ago.

  [Text] Bomb cookbook: Danish police and Interpol are 
investigating a case that might be connected to terrorism. 
  The police in Arhus have asked Interpol for help in 
identifying three Egyptians that might be connected to terrorism. 
  The three Egyptians, two of whom have applied for asylum, 
are 
in custody in Arhus, charged with arson of a Jordanian's home in 
Tranbjerg. However, during the investigation police found items 
that connect them to terrorism, according to ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE. 
  While searching the home of one of the suspects the police 
found among other things, a "bomb cookbook" with recipes for 
making explosives. Two of the prisoners have also tried to buy 
chemicals for this purpose from a business in Arhus. They were 
refused because a special permit is required to buy some of the 
items. 
  The search also revealed a leaflet urging all Muslims to 
kill 
infidels, a register of names and addresses of foreigners living 
in Denmark, and papers in Arabic urging anybody participating in 
subversive work to use false names. 
  According to ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE, the potential political 
elements in the case caused an Arabic-speaking interpreter to 
become so nervous that he immediately asked to be excused from 
the job of interpreting. 
  One of the Egyptians has lived in Brabrand for many years. 
The other two, after a stay at the Sandholm camp, have had as 
their address the Red Cross's asylum center in Odder for the 
last two to three months. However, they have been at the asylum 
center, where no other Egyptians live, only a few times, and the 
rest of the time they have been at Brabrand. 
  The three men, who are 28, 35, and 42 years old 
respectively, 
were arrested on 18 November and so far are only charged with 
arson. But in court on Friday [3 December] the prosecutor 
reserved the right to expand the charges. 
  According to ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE, one of the suspects 
informed them during a previous hearing that he is an Egyptian 
colonel who fled to Denmark because of having participated in a 
political attack earlier this year. He alleges that he has been 
sentenced to death in absentia.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Dec (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has stressed that whoever gives any information leading 
to the discovery of terrorists will be immediately rewarded. A 
small piece of information that may appear insignificant to 
citizens may lead to important positive results for the security 
agencies, he said. 
  Speaking after honoring three citizens who helped in the 
arrest of terrorist Sayyid Salah Sayyid Sulayman, who is 
suspected in the unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, the minister praised the positive 
contribution of the Egyptian public. He said that the 
successful efforts of security forces at this stage depend on 
cooperation from the public. 
  Al-Alfi said the enlightened Egyptian masses have realized 
that confronting the challenges facing the homeland requires 
unity against all criminal attempts against the security of the 
country and the safety of the citizens. 
  [In a Cairo-datelined report, Paris AFP in English at 1642 
GMT adds: "Three informers on Saturday shared a reward of 
$30,000 for the arrest of nine suspects in the attempted 
assassination of Egypt's Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi."]

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Dec (MENA)--An explosion took place early 
this morning near a tourist bus parked near the ancient church 
of St. George in the Old Cairo [Masr al-Qadimah] area. 
  Police and public security commanders went to the site to 
determine the cause of the explosion. 
  [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0849 GMT on 27 
December adds the following: "Suspected Muslim fundamentalists 
wounded nine Austrian holidaymakers in an attack on a tour bus 
here on Monday, police said. 
  ["The attack took place in an old district in the south of 
the city."] 
  According to preliminary information, the explosion occurred 
in the 'Umar Ibn-al-'Ass Square. The driver of the bus, which 
belongs to a tourist company, was surprised by an explosion near 
the bus. 
  He sped off with his vehicle, stopping outside the St. 
George 
Church. 
  The explosion shattered the windows on both sides of the 
bus; 
it is likely that this could have been the result of gunshots. 
[as received] 
  Nine Austrians among a group of 18 tourists were hurt in the 
incident along with the driver and the tour guide. 
  Eight civilians were also wounded chasing the perpetrators, 
who opened fire indiscriminately as they escaped. 
  The wounded were taken to the al-Nil University Hospital at 
Qasr al-'Ayni and the Dar al-Salam Hospital. Criminal 
laboratory experts under the command of Major General Husayn 
Tawfiq, Interior Ministry officials, and criminal investigation 
officials went to the scene to investigate.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Dec (MENA)--The Prosecution Office in Misr 
al-Qadimah this afternoon began investigations into the tourist 
bus incident that occurred in Misr al-Qadimah this morning. The 
Prosecution Office summoned the bus driver, Muhammad Safiy. He 
said that at 0845 today, he saw at the scene of the incident two 
terrorists. One of them hurled what looked like a stone at the 
bus from the left side of the road. He said that the object hit 
the glass and fell to the ground, but nothing happened. He 
noted that, afterward, he heard an explosion and gunfire. He 
sped away in the bus after the explosion smashed bus windows and 
damaged the inside. He said that he stopped the bus after a 
short distance because the criminals had disappeared down a side 
street and because of the commotion caused by a number of 
injured tourists. 
  The Misr al-Qadimah Prosecution Office also summoned 
witnesses 'Abd-al-Rahman Muhanna, a bricklayer, and Rajab 
Jad-al-Rabb, a carpenter. Both witnesses gave the same evidence 
as the bus driver, but they also described the two terrorists. 
They noted that one of the criminals kicked the explosive 
charge, which did not explode. It rolled about 10 meters and 
then exploded near a cafe, injuring some customers. They also 
said that one of the two terrorists was wearing jeans and a 
military jacket and the other was wearing a black jacket and 
gray trousers. Both terrorists, who were carrying pistols, 
managed to escape down a side street leading to the corniche 
while firing indiscriminately. The Prosecution Office decided 
to keep the bus and entrusted intelligence personnel to 
apprehend the criminals quickly. It also asked the criminal 
laboratory to quickly prepare a report on the incident.

  [Text] Paris, Dec 28 (AFP)--An underground Islamic 
fundamentalist group in Egypt on Tuesday [28 December] claimed 
responsibility for the bomb and gun attack on a Cairo tour bus 
that wounded eight Austrians. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] said Monday's 
attack in Misr al-Qadimah, after which the assailants shot and 
wounded eight Egyptians while fleeing the scene, was "in 
retaliation for the recent executions" of several al-Jama'ah 
members. 
  Al-Jama'ah claimed responsibility in a statement sent to the 
Arabic daily AL-HAYAH, which is published in several capitals. 
  At least 261 people have been killed since March 1992, when 
Islamic militants stepped up their violent campaign aimed at 
toppling the secular government of President Husni Mubarak. 
  The government has rounded up hundreds of suspects and 
hanged 
23 Moslem fundamentalists since June.

<F P=106> [Report from Asyut by 'Isam 'Abd-al-Jawad] </F>
  [Text] Terrorist groups have infiltrated the Asyut Security 
Directorate's information system. The evidence emerged in 
incidents last Sunday and Monday in which 14 people were killed 
and 20 wounded during the biggest terrorist operation in Asyut 
since the October 1981 incidents [in which Islamists tried to 
seize power following the assassination of al-Sadat]. 
  News circulating recently in Asyut confirms that the 
terrorist groups have infiltrated the information system that 
details the movements of security leaders within the 
governorate. The groups learned the times these leaders report 
for work despite constant changes to their routes and the color 
and model of the cars they use and some leaders using cars 
without license plates for camouflage. 
  The news was confirmed by officials, who explained that by 
obtaining the security information, terrorist groups "avenged" 
the death of their amir [leader] in Manfalut in just 90 minutes 
by assassinating Brigadier General Muhammad Tu'aymah and his 
guard. The security agencies have denied any link between the 
two incidents. The "Islamic Group" established the link in a 
statement that confirmed Brig. Gen. Tu'ayumah was assassinated 
in response to the killing of the Manfalut Islamic Group leader. 
  Recent incidents have revealed a serious development in 
terrorist operations in Asyut. Plastic incendiary hand grenades 
were used for the first time in addition to the incendiary, 
penetrating bullets [as published] the use and circulation of 
which is prohibited among citizens. 
  Security sources have told ROSE AL-YUSUF that the security 
apparatus has arrested 150 terrorists in the past few days. 
They are being interrogated for referral to the State Security 
Prosecution. 
  Elsewhere, the Interior Ministry has sent a group of 
high-ranking security leaders [to Asyut] to work out a new plan 
to terminate terrorist operations there and overcome the 
shortcomings affecting the information system of the Asyut 
Security Directorate.

  [Text] Chandigarh -- A walkman, a leather jacket or a few 
hundred rupees is all that costs smugglers and Pak spies to get 
past the immigration checks at the Bombay airport and Attari 
railway station in Punjab. 
  The Union Defence Ministry, in a recent report sent to 
Punjab 
Police, has stated that not only were the immigration and custom 
authorities at Attari and Bombay careless in their duties, but 
frequently accepted bribes. On the basis of the interrogation of 
the arrested smugglers and spies the Ministry was able to tell 
the exact dates on which such lapses occurred during the past 
two years. 
  Among those interrogated was a Pak spy, Mohammed Sharief, 
who 
was apprehended in Delhi in June. The MOD [Ministry of Defence] 
report states that on one occasion, two Pak smugglers got past 
the immigration authorities at Attari by paying Rs [rupees] 200 
to the staff at lower level. On another occasion, two smugglers 
were allowed to carry 40 kg of paan (betel leaves) to Pakistan 
by paying Rs 500 to an immigration official. 
  Another official gave them the go ahead when they obliged 
him 
with a walkman. On two other occasions, they managed to get past 
the immigration authorities with fake documents and by paying Rs 
1000 each to two officials, who also asked for their leather 
jackets. 
  Similarly, in Bombay they were able to enter and leave the 
country on fake documents without any difficulty. On one 
occasion, a Punjab militant, Manjit Singh. also traveled with 
them to Bombay on fake documents. They had procured forged 
passports and visa for Rs 2000 each in Delhi. 
  The report by R.K. Singh, Director in the Ministry of 
Defence, mentions the names of guest houses in Delhi, Bombay and 
Aligarh, which were frequented by Pak contacts. The report has 
underlined the need for proper vetting of immigration and custom 
staff. A senior Punjab Police officer told INDIAN EXPRESS, "We 
are trying to trace the policemen mentioned in the report, who 
will face stringent action." 
  Meanwhile, the Union Finance Ministry has also taken up the 
issue of lack of security at the two vital check points which 
could have serious implications on national security. M. R. 
Sivaraman, Secretary Department of Revenue in Ministry of 
Finance, has written to the Punjab Government last month urging 
it to bring the immigration control at Attari railway station 
under the overall supervision of a young motivated, gazetted 
officer. 
  The Bombay blasts have confirmed that ISI [Inter-services 
Intelligence] was trying to create disturbances in India and 
this required strengthening of units at all vital points of 
entry and exit, he added. Sivaraman has pointed out that the 
Chandigarh office of the Collector of Customs and Central Excise 
had reported that immigration checks were not being carried out 
with full vigour due to acute shortage of staff.

  [Text] Brussels, 29 Dec (BELGA) -- "The deputy prime

refused, by a ministerial decree of 26 December 1993, to 
extradite Amanullah Khan [see p. 5 of 20 October Terrorism 
Report for arrest report] to the Indian authorities, insofar as 
this extradition application was based on the arrest warrants 
issued on 26 April 1990 and 26 October 1993 by the court of 
Jammu-Kashmir. This decision was based on the negative advice 
of the Chamber of Indictment," the Justice Ministry said early 
on Wednesday evening. 
  "As a result of this decision, the person concerned was put 
at the disposal of the Aliens Affairs Department in the course 
of the afternoon of 28 December 1993, at the order of the public 
prosecutor in Brussels." 
  "On 29 December 1993 the Aliens Affairs Department decided, 
given that the person concerned did not have valid residence 
papers in Belgium, to issue an order to leave the country. The 
person concerned was taken to the border and given a ticket to 
Pakistan," the Justice Ministry statement said.

<F P=106> [Dieter Rulff report: "Murder Under the Eyes of the </F>
Intelligence Service"; spelling of all Iranian names as 
published] 
  [Text] Berlin -- It goes to the lasting credit of Heinz 
Annussek, head of the Berlin Land Office for the Protection of 
the Constitution, that the debate about security policy in 
Germany has been supplemented with the "practicing terrorist." 
Speaking to the "Mykonos" Investigation Committee of the 
Chamber of Deputies, he used this description to make a fine 
differentiation regarding the dangerousness of Iranian Kazem 
Darabi. Darabi is currently on trial at the Berlin Higher Court 
for having been, as an agent of the Iranian intelligence service 
VEVAK, the wire puller of the attack which killed four leading 
Kurdish-Iranian opposition politicians on 17 September 1992. 
According to Annussek's assessment after the deed, his office 
considered Darabi worth being watched before the attack, but he 
had not been assessed as a "practicing terrorist" -- that is why 
his observation was ignored for months. Eckart Werthebach, head 
of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution 
[BfV], also did not have "such an assessment of Darabi as a 
dangerous terrorist" until the day of the attack. 
  In the meantime, doubts about this assessment of the 
situation by the security organs are mounting. The security 
organs might have come to different results and could have 
protected Sadegh Sharafkandi, chairman of the Democratic Party 
of Kurdistan in Iran, and his three associates better if they 
had better coordinated and exploited their own sources. Thus, 
as early as on 16 April 1992 Kazem Darabi's foreigner's file was 
"urgently" requested by the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations [BKA]. According to a BKA letter, which has been 
obtained by DIE TAGESZEITUNG, at that time the officials were 
investigating, upon request by the chief federal prosecutor, 
several persons "on the suspicion of attempting to bring about a 
dynamite explosion and of attempted murder." The chief federal 
prosecutor's office did not want to tell DIE TAGESZEITUNG about 
the background of the investigations, but the fact that Darabi's 
foreigner's file was requested leads to the conclusion that he 
was considered a suspect by the investigators. At this time his 
foreigner's file was checked in the Senat's internal 
administration, but none of the officials involved suspected 
anything as a result of the request. 
  In the Committee Greens Deputy Renate Kuenast is trying to 
clarify the background of a BfV report, according to which at 
the beginning of 1992 several persons, including a Kazem D., in 
a Hamburg mosque prepared attacks on Israeli institutions in the 
FRG. 
  The curiosity of Kuenast's colleague from the Free 
Democratic 
Party of Germany, Rolf-Peter Lange, is also directed at a list 
with about a dozen names of persons who were classified by the 
BKA as dangerous in the field of foreigners' extremism in 
Germany at the same time; this list once again included Darabi. 
Even though the BfV told their colleagues in Berlin already in 
January 1992 that they had suspended the monitoring of Darabi's 
telephone and had recommended that the Land Office initiate 
operative measures, these measures were not initiated. 
Allegedly, it was impossible to find an interpreter who spoke 
Persian. Telephone monitoring was approved only two weeks after 
the attack. 
  However, even during this "security gap" in the months 
before 
the attack, the scene did not remain unobserved, as it has 
turned out now. In an internal note to the chief federal 
prosecutor (Az.: VC 11-247-S-350 070/93), the BfV reports: "In 
addition to Darabi and his Berlin scene, members of the Iranian 
intelligence services were also directly involved in the 
preparations for the attack. Thus, members of the Iranian 
intelligence services were in Germany before the attack and 
spied out the site of the attack as well as escape routes." 
  The eight-page document by the BfV also reports on the 
intensive contacts that Darabi cultivated with Iranian diplomats 
in Germany. Thus, he had ties to Hassan Djavady, who worked at 
the Iranian Embassy in Bonn until October 1989. According to 
the note, he is "an employee of the Iranian intelligence service 
MOIS, who was responsible in the FRG for, among other things, 
the observation and spying out of the Iranian opposition." 
According to BfV findings, this task was "taken over by MOIS 
employee Morteza Gholami, who works at the Iranian Embassy in 
Bonn." In addition, Darabi also has contact with members of the 
Iranian intelligence service in Berlin. As the BfV noted, on 24 
April 1991 Darabi received "the order by Consul Mahmud 
Amani-Farani, who works at the Iranian Consulate General in 
Berlin, to collect information about a member of the 
`Association of Kurdish Students Abroad.'" Because of this 
spying order, the BfV think that "one has to assume" that 
Aman-Farani "is also working for an intelligence service." 
"Apart from the consul general," Aman-Farani is Darabi's most 
important contact in the Iranian Consulate General. 
  According to findings by the Iranian opposition alliance 
"National Resistance Council," the Iranian intelligence service 
has meanwhile found ways to keep in regular contact with Darabi 
in prison. This week Javad Dabiran, the spokesman of the 
Resistance Council, voiced a number of accusations against 
individual diplomats. According to Dabiran, he wants to give 
the missing evidence for these accusations to the German 
security authorities. As Dabiran said, the wire pullers are 
sitting on the third floor of the Iranian Embassy in Bonn, where 
there is the department of the VEVAK intelligence service. 
Until two weeks ago, this department was headed by Alireza 
Haghighian, who, camouflaged as an Embassy attache, is the 
highest-ranking VEVAK agent in Germany. In the meantime, he has 
returned to the intelligence service headquarters in Tehran. In 
addition, Dabiran accuses two Embassy second secretaries, Ali 
Dschafari Meschki and Hamidreza Ghalibaf, of having "dealt 
intensively," as VEVAK agents, "with the case (of the Mykonos 
murder -- the editor)" over the past weeks. 
  The opposition politician claims that one of the agents who 
are responsible for keeping contact with Darabi is a certain 
Farhad D. Already in 1982 D. was involved, together with 
Darabi, in an attack on opposition students in Mainz; according 
to BfV findings, he has "ties with the Iranian intelligence 
service." Together with Bahman B., the two are "among the 
leading functionaries of the `Union of Islamic Students in 
Europe [USIA].'" The USIA is a "collection pond of the 
followers of the Iranian regime in the European countries." 
According to the BfV report, B. has worked "for the Iranian 
intelligence service MOIS" since about 1989. His wife 
reportedly works at the Iranian Consulate in Berlin. 
  These intensive activities of the Iranian diplomats were 
probably not unknown to State Minister in the Chancellor's 
Office Bernd Schmidbauer, the supreme head of the German 
intelligence services. According to Dabiran's assessment, the 
"Mykonos" case played a decisive role in Schmidbauer's 
contentious talk with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Fallahian. 
Actually, on Thursday Schmidbauer should have answered 
questions of the Investigation Committee about the role that the 
"Mykonos" case played in his contacts with Iran. However, the 
appointment was canceled, since he had allegedly not yet 
received permission by the Cabinet to make a statement. Another 
appointment for questioning him has now been made for January.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "On the Trail of Very Special </F>
Iranian Agents"; spelling of Iranian names as published] 
  [Text] Close call for the drug-squad inspector. The 
Iranian-born policeman and occasional legal translator had 
noticed -- being a professional -- that he was being shadowed. 
The stalker was identified: Mojlabi Mashady, a peculiar 
Iranian -- married to a French woman -- who specializes in 
import and export activities, is apparently known in drug 
dealing circles and is currently in jail. Above all, he is 
allegedly an Iranian intelligence agent in Paris, in charge of 
eliminating opponents to the Tehran mullah regime. 
  Informed of the policeman's adventure, Judge Bruguiere set 
the DST [Directorate for Territorial Surveillance] and the 
Criminal Brigade on the trail of the "special agent." A proven 
technique which had already made it possible to identify the 
murderers of Chapour Bakhtiar in Paris, it proved once again 
remarkably effective. It revealed that Mojlabi Mashady, with an 
accomplice called Hossein Yazdan Seta, had also been 
"blacklisting" other Iranian political dissidents living in 
Paris, as well as on a family member of the former Shah of Iran. 
The small commando apparently intended to act quickly against 
one of the "targets," whose life was probably saved by 
preventive action by the police. 
  A systematic inquiry conducted into Mojlabi Mashady's 
activities showed that the team had probably done some damage 
already. One of Mashady's contacts, incarcerated for 
drug-related activities, was questioned in his cell by the 
police. He revealed that he had been contacted by Mashady and 
taken to Tehran, where he had been offered a respectable amount 
of money to kill a dissident living in exile in Paris: Cyrus 
Elahi, a doctor and founder of the ODJ (Organization for Iranian 
Freedom) and a former lecturer at Tehran's Melli University. The 
young man had refused the highly detailed contract. However, 
shortly thereafter, on 23 October, Dr. Cyrus Elahi was indeed 
assassinated -- shot four times in the head in the entrance hall 
of his apartment building, located in Bourdelle street in 
Paris's 15th district. 
  This testimony, confirmed by other evidence, was enough for 
Judge Bruguiere to jail Mojlabi Mashady and Hossein Yazdan Seta 
on Tuesday [21 December], for "complicity with murder in 
relation with terrorist activities." 
  This is one more bone of contention between France and Iran, 
at a time when Judge Bruguiere is about to finalize his 
investigation into Chapour Bakhtiar's murder and has referred to 
the Assize Court the four persons imprisoned in France in 
connection with this affair. Moreover, two suspected murderers 
of an Iranian dissident shot in Lausanne have been arrested in 
Paris and Switzerland wants them extradited. 
  So matters are turning more litigious and "sensitive" 
between 
Paris and Tehran. But can one let the henchmen of a foreign 
state "settle accounts" with impunity in France, turning the 
capital into one large shooting range against political 
opponents?

  [Text] Tehran, Dec 29 (AFP) -- An Iraqi Shiite Moslem 
opposition group on Wednesday accused the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK) of killing six Moslem religious leaders in 
northern Iraq. 
  The Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq 
(SAIRI), in a statement received here by AFP, said the religious 
leaders had either been executed or killed during clashes 
between the PUK and the rival pro-Iranian Kurdistan Islamic 
League (KIL). 
  SAIRI also charged that several mosques in northern Iraq had 
been badly hit during the fighting. 
  "SAIRI strongly condemns such acts and calls for an 
immediate 
ceasefire and negotiations," the statement said. 
  Kurdish sources said at least 72 people had been killed and 
250 wounded in clashes between the PUK and KIL since last week, 
mostly in Irbil and al-Sulaymaniyah, which lies close to the 
Iranian border. 
  The PUK flushed out KIL fighters from their military bases 
on 
Monday. 
  PUK leader Jalal Talabani told AFP on Tuesday that the KIL 
had surrendered their weapons. 
  Meanwhile, SAIRI said an Islamic delegation representing 
groups opposed to the Iraqi government would soon leave Syria 
for northern Iraq to mediate between the rival Kurdish factions. 
  The delegation met with Talabani in Damascus Tuesday to 
discuss the situation in northern Iraq, it said. 
  They asked Talabani to declare an immediate ceasefire and 
called for information on the fate of the KIL leader, Shaykh 
'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, according to SAIRI.

  [Excerpts] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] spiritual leader, said this morning that 
his movement would accept a cease-fire with Israel provided that 
the use of firearms against Palestinians stops. Yasin added 
that Hamas will not stop its activities until the Jewish 
settlements in the Gaza Strip are evacuated. Shaykh Yasin made 
the remarks at a meeting this morning with Knesset Member Talib 
al-Sani' at the Ramla Prison hospital where Yasin is being 
imprisoned. [passage omitted with al-Sani' remarks] 
  At the same time, more than 1,000 Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
leaflets were found last night in a large bag on Temple Mount 
urging the termination of the peace process, attacks on the 
settlers, and exacerbating the security situation in the 
territories. The Jerusalem Police launched an investigation.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Deputy Defense Minister 
Mordekhay Gur said tonight that Hamas is succeeding in carrying 
out painful attacks, but is not in control in the territories. 
He said that Israel rejects the conditions presented by Hamas 
for a cease-fire, and regards them as a provocation. Hamas 
leaders want to present themselves as negotiating with Israel, 
but we chose to negotiate with the PLO because it is the main 
force in the Palestinian street, Gur said. [passage omitted on

<F P=106> [Report by ITIM] </F>
  [Text] The security forces have stopped hunting for Fatah 
fugitives in the Gaza District who murdered Israelis and 
Palestinians, under an agreement reached between senior Fatah 
leaders in the district and IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
commanders in the region. 
  An IDF source confirmed the report, adding that it was 
forced 
upon the army, and that some IDF officers in the field are 
furious with the agreement. 
  At a meeting held two weeks ago, the two sides agreed the 
IDF 
would completely halt its pursuit of armed Fatah fugitives, 
including those known to have committed murder. According to 
the agreement, the IDF agreed there would be no active pursuit 
of these fugitives, but that if they happened to be caught, they 
would be arrested by the security forces. 
  It was agreed brothers 'Umar and Rajih Abu-Sittah, believed 
to have murdered, among others, Shaya Deutsch of Kfar Yam in 
Qatif Bloc last March, would have to hide in one place and not 
walk the streets. The IDF agreed not to pursue them despite the 
fact that they are suspected murderers.

  [Excerpt] Settlers in the Qatif Bloc have decided to 
establish a body that will capture terrorist murderers who are 
members of the Fatah organization. This comes in the wake of 
the report, first released by ITIM, that the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] has called off its pursuit of Fatah murderers. One of 
the settlers told an ITIM correspondent that if the IDF cannot 
do its job, the settlers, whose friends have been murdered, 
cannot sit by without bringing the murderers to justice.

  [Text] Damascus, 25 Dec (SANA)--The Palestine National 
Liberation Movement, Fatah [the Uprising], has announced that 
one of its groups has detonated explosive and incendiary devices 
inside the Israeli ship Jrush Shalom [name as received] while it 
was docked at Eilat port. 
  A statement issued by the movement today said the explosion 
caused a fire in the ship and that heavy clouds of poisonous 
gases were leaked as a result of the fire in the ship's cargo of 
poisonous materials. The ship's cargo was due to be unloaded 
into the warehouses of the enemy's army. 
  The statement said 11 sailors were injured, and the group 
that carried out the operation returned safely.

<F P=106> [Report by territories correspondent Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Excerpts] Leaflet No. 2 of the Hebron Fatah Hawks group 
warns: "Ge'ula Kohen should know that we are lying in wait for 
her and her racist, extremist gang, which has come to set Hebron 
on fire." 
  The leaflet, which was distributed on 25 December, also 
says: 
"There will be no peace without the expulsion of the settlers 
from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The intifadah must be 
kept at a high level, and painful blows must continue to rain on 
the settlers. The circle of jihad between us will grow, and we 
shall threaten their security night and day through all possible 
forms of struggle." 
  The Fatah Hawks group in the Hebron region, which is 
considered "Abu-Jihad's [Khalil al-Wazir] fortress," devoted its 
leaflet, entitled "A Call for Steadfast Struggle and 
Confrontation Against the Settler Gangs," to issuing various 
instructions to the population with regard to the struggle 
against the settlers, with the emphasis placed on 
intifadah-style activities. 
  The Fatah Hawks declared that 1 January, Fatah Day, will 
mark 
an intensification of the battle against the settlers. Detailed 
instructions were given on how to assist local residents who 
live near the settlers in their struggle. 
  Wealthy residents were asked to contribute funds to support 
these residents and the Hebron Fatah organization. Property 
owners were asked to take 25 percent off the rent they charge in 
light of the difficult economic situation in the area. 
  Town residents were asked to increase their presence in the 
Cave of the Patriarchs to prevent the Jews from taking over. 
The Fatah Hawks have also forbidden town residents to park 
their cars in the center of town, "so that our squads will have 
an easier job carrying out their operations (against the 
settlers working nearby)." 
  As in the first leaflet distributed by the Fatah Hawks 
approximately two weeks ago, this leaflet also calls for 
"national unity" and coordination between Fatah and the 
organizations that oppose the peace process: Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement], the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine. 
  The two leaflets call for a fundamental organizational 
reform 
in Fatah activity and demand the expulsion of "suspicious 
elements who spread corruption in the organization's ranks and 
cast aside its principles, values, and history in order to empty 
Fatah of all content." [passage omitted] 
  Palestinian sources in Hebron expressed the assessment that 
the activity of the Fatah Hawks reflects the positions of the 
hardliners in the organization, who call for military activities 
and are represented by 'Abbas Zaki and Muhammad Jihad, the heads 
of the organization's "western sector" mechanism. 
  This faction of Fatah regards Abu-Jihad, 'Arafat's deputy 
who 
directed the armed struggle in Israel and was murdered in 1988, 
as its spiritual mentor.

  [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 
Network in Hebrew at 1800 GMT on 28 December reports that 
"Islamic Jihad activist Muhammad Abu-al-Rish today turned 
himself in to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in Khan Yunus. 
The IDF later released him as a gesture to Fatah in view of the 
fact that Muhammad's brother, who was a Fatah activist, was shot 
dead last week. To date the IDF had only released Fatah members 
who turned themselves in." 
  The report goes on to quote official IDF sources as saying 
that "Muhammad Abu-al-Rish is a Fatah activist and not a member 
of Islamic Jihad." 
  Army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that "a 
large rally was staged at noon today in Khan Yunus by Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] to celebrate the return of the 
deportees from Lebanon to their homes in the Gaza Strip."

  [Text] Since the signing of the agreement with the PLO 
there has been an increase in the number of stone-throwing and 
petrol bomb incidents and a decrease in the number of shooting 
and stabbing incidents: 180 petrol bombs were thrown in the 
three months preceding the agreement, whereas 315 were thrown 
since the signing of the agreement on 13 September. On the 
other hand there has been a sharp fall in the number of shooting 
and stabbing incidents. These figures were relayed from the 
prime minister's bureau to Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu at 
the latter's request. The Likud claims that the government is 
hiding the figures in order to justify the claim that the 
intifadah has subsided.

<F P=106> [Report by Alan Ben-'Ami] </F>
  [Text] The Israeli Army spokesman has just issued some 
very brief details about a clash between Israeli soldiers and 
terrorists on the border with Lebanon in the eastern sector of 
the security zone. According to the first details, three 
terrorists were killed in the clash as they tried to cross the 
border fence near the village of Arajah in the eastern sector. 
It is approximately in the area of Kibbutz Dan in the Upper 
Galilee region. 
  Israeli soldiers were alerted to the infiltration attempt, 
arrived quickly at the scene and opened fire at the terrorists, 
killing them. There are no reports of any casualties on the 
Israeli side, and apparently the head of Northern Command, Major 
General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, has arrived at the scene to check out 
the situation, and has already praised the action of the 
soldiers, and particularly their speedy arrival at the site of 
the infiltration.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] During a rally held by 
Hizballah in al-Ghaziyah town on the occasion of the death of 
Ayatollah Golpayegani, Shaykh Na'im Qasim, Hizballah's deputy 
secretary general, dealt with the issue of the U.S. 
investigating committee. He said that this committee seeks to 
boost the Israelis' morale, because the fate of the Israeli 
prisoners in Lebanon is known to everyone. He added that 
international parties intervened and are aware of their fate. 
However, he said that the talks should have focused on the fate 
of hundreds of detainees held in the enemy prisons, particularly 
in al-Khiyam, where the prisoners suffer enormously. 
  Shaykh Qasim said: It's unreasonable that the fate of 
aggressors is discussed, while the fate of innocent people, who 
were detained in their homes and who are defending this land, is 
not discussed. Therefore, we see no need to meet with any 
committee because it is part of the campaign to promote Israeli 
topics rather than resolving the issue of the prisoners and 
detainees in Israeli prisons. 
  Shaykh Qasim emphasized that Israeli pilot Ron Arad has 
never 
been held by us nor do we know his fate or his whereabouts.

  [Text] In an interview with al-Fajr Television Network that 
will be broadcast Sunday [19 December], Hizballah Secretary 
General Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah has reiterated Hizballah's 
refusal to meet any official committee of the U.S. 
Administration or Congress because the U.S. Administration is 
ignoring the fate of thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese 
detainees, prisoners, and hostages in Israeli prisons. They 
only talk about the fate of some Israeli soldiers who were taken 
prisoner in Lebanese territory. This administration is not 
qualified to play a humanitarian role, Sayyid Nasrallah added. 
  His eminence, however, voiced the party's readiness to 
discuss the fate of the Zionist soldiers and Lahdist agents held 
by the party with international and humanitarian organizations 
and with friendly parties that support our people's right to 
resistance in return for the release of all the detainees held 
in the Zionist occupation prisons. 
  Asked about the U.S. plan, which aims to exclude Resolution 
425 from the settlement process, Sayyid Nasrallah said: At the 
least, the Lebanese Government must withdraw completely from the 
negotiations because the United States and Israel are seeking to 
deprive the Lebanese authority of this resolution. The U.S. 
plan should serve as a warning to the Lebanese authorities and 
to all the people of the region. He said: We urge the 
political authority in Lebanon and the Lebanese people, as well 
as all forces, to realize that the only force that could be 
relied on in the liberation process is the force of resistance. 
He said that resistance will continue as long as occupation 
continues. 
  In response to a question about the internal situation and 
the current crises, Sayyid Nasrallah said: The government is 
hatching plots against Lebanon and its people, as well as 
against Lebanon's alliance with Syria. Had our people and 
masses not been patient in the wake of the 13 September massacre 
and had it not been for the caution exercised vis-a-vis the role 
played by certain government figures, Lebanon would have 
collapsed. There are people working to render Lebanon an easy 
prey for the Americans and Israelis. 
  Sayyid Nasrallah called for the creation of a broad 
opposition front based on clear-cut objectives to safeguard and 
salvage Lebanon. He said: This government has made enough 
mistakes, which has enabled the opposition to increase every day.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Hizballah Secretary General </F>
Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah by Muhammad Baqir Shari; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpt] [introductory passage omitted] Regarding the 
attempt by some local media to focus negative attention on 
Hizballah and the Islamic issue consistently and deliberately, 
Hizballah Secretary General Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah said: We 
have consistently tried to disregard the "reports" and comments 
published in this weekly media platform. We have also avoided 
issuing any clarification or denial of any report or 
"information." If we get "involved" in denying everything that 
is published in this respect, we will then find ourselves 
compelled to issue countless "denials." And if we forget to deny 
any report or "information," the people will think that what has 
not been denied must be true. Hence our party's cadres have 
become used to these types of "reports" and "information," 
particularly because these cadres know that all these reports 
have shaky foundations. Sometimes they are so unjust that they 
are useful to us because they enhance our credibility when they 
are proved wrong. They only increase the people's confidence in 
us and their sympathy for us. 
  As for the existence of multiple trends inside the party, we 
stress that there are never identical views or opinions between 
one person and another, even if they are in the same 
organization or party. Differences in views are possible and 
are usually necessary. They are even a duty. Those who claim 
that there are "differences" or "divisions" inside the party 
must provide proof or evidence. We are not required to prove 
the falsity of these allegations, first, because the constant 
task of denial is a waste of time and a diversion from the task, 
and, second, because we are confident that these allegations 
will be automatically proved to be false with the passage of 
time. Our bases have sufficient immunity on this issue. 
  The party has recently undergone important experiences, 
especially the events that followed the signing of the 
"Gaza-Jericho" option. Can any one of those who claim that 
there are such trends inside the party provide a single piece of 
evidence that there is a real division over any stand taken by 
the party during these important, and even grave, developments! 
  Regarding the campaign launched by a man of religion 
affiliated with Iran against the Hizballah secretary general, 
Nasrallah said: We are dealing with this phenomenon with the 
same spirit and method. We are not annoyed by this. We believe 
that it only strengthens the confidence in the leadership and 
also boosts popular sympathy for the party. The people are 
saying: Israel is seeking the physical liquidation of the 
party's leaders, in addition to trying to mar the party's 
reputation as a whole. Israel is the one that assassinated 
'Abbas al-Musawi, former secretary general and prince of the 
martyrs, and is targeting the new secretary general and, of 
course, all the other leaders. Whoever is waging such a 
campaign is only collaborating with the enemy, either 
intentionally or unintentionally. This "popular" view of the 
issue strengthens our self-confidence and stands. He added: 
This unjust "campaign" has exploited, for example, the party's 
decision to participate in the elections to attack us with the 
aim of "weakening" our stand by making these allegations before 
the leadership of the Islamic revolution in Iran. It was 
revolution leader Ayatollah Khamene'i who blessed our decision 
to enter the elections battle. Therefore, the opposition to the 
party's participation in the election became an opposition to 
the Islamic revolution's leader. Any attack on us over this 
issue is an attack on the revolution leader himself. 
  There was one beneficial outcome of this "campaign" against 
us, namely some people's accusations that we were working to 
establish an Islamic rule or an Islamic state. This helped us 
because it absolved us of something that others regarded as an 
"accusation" and made our activities acceptable to circles that 
accused us of working to impose the establishment of an Islamic 
state in Lebanon. We do not hide our belief in the rule of 
Islam, but we do not want to impose our views by force. We call 
for following God through wisdom, example, and conviction. 
  Regarding the allegations made in the campaign against the 
Hizballah secretary general that there is a trend that is 
following the al-Da'wah Party inside Hizballah, the secretary 
general stressed that those who have joined Hizballah from the 
al-Da'wah Party have left their former affiliation behind and 
have become part of the Hizballah trend, like the Amal Movement 
members who joined Hizballah. Even many members who were in the 
al-Da'wah Party might criticize the ideas and methods they 
adopted during their former party affiliation, as former Amal 
members did. Martyr 'Abbas himself was originally a member of 
the al-Da'wah Party, yet he was a splendid embodiment of the 
Hizballah trend. 
  We told the Hizballah secretary general: We heard from you 
more than seven years ago that those who joined Hizballah from 
other organizations brought the methods and traditions of their 
previous organizations to Hizballah and tried to practice them 
within the party. Nasrallah stressed that this was at the 
beginning. Over time, everyone has blended into the same 
melting pot. One example of this is the al-Da'wah Party. 
Underground activity was one of its doctrines. Some of its 
former members who joined Hizballah carried with them the spirit 
of underground activity, even when there was no need for 
secrecy. But such habits have changed with time, as I mentioned 
earlier. 
  When we told him that the presence of the al-Da'wah Party in 
many countries and places could, due to human nature, affect the 
former members who joined Hizballah, the secretary general said: 
Those former al-Da'wah Party members who are members of 
Hizballah have absolutely no relationship with those who were in 
the al-Da'wah Party in any other place. Those who joined 
Hizballah from the al-Da'wah Party are very critical of the 
mistakes the al-Da'wah Party made, just as any other party could 
make mistakes. 
  With regard to some published reports about the fact that 
Hasan Nasrallah brought misfortune to the party, he said: I did 
not read what was written about this issue carefully. But such 
statements are contradictory, if not ignorant. Those who wrote 
such things also said that Hizballah has become stronger, has 
established its private economic institutions, increased the 
number of its members, and spread like wildfire in the south or 
other areas of the country recently. How could that have 
happened, particularly during the last two years--according to 
what they say--when these two years are the ones when I assumed 
the position of secretary general of the party, and I, according 
to their claims, succeeded in managing the party with skill and 
professionalism? And at the same time, they claim that I 
brought misfortune to the party. 
  On the subject of relations with 'Allamah Fadlallah, the 
Hizballah secretary general affirmed that he has a distinguished 
relationship with 'Allamah Fadlallah and that he always meets 
with him, listens to his advice, and discusses important and 
sensitive matters with him. He has never had a real difference 
of opinion with him. Yes, the organizational state of the party 
is very different from the important religious personality, 
which is respected and held in high esteem by all. Due to his 
nonorganizational position in the party, 'Allamah Fadlallah 
could, for example, receive people we are not compelled to 
receive. He could establish relations with people whom we see 
no need to establish relations with. In addition, certain 
topics could be discussed, and we could have our own opinion on 
them. This is something that does not bother the 'allamah. But 
there was never an argument in the sense some media have been 
reporting. 
  Regarding the silence on the results of the investigation 
into the airport bridge incident [in which the Army shot at 
Hizballah demonstrators], he said: We were not silent and will 
not remain silent. This incident has infiltrated our conscience 
and even the psychological makeup of our party. It will never 
be allowed to fade away. We are waiting for the issue to be 
raised on a broader and more significant dimension in the 
Chamber of Deputies. It is true that some sides want us to 
temporarily quiet what they call the exaggerated attack on the 
state regarding this matter, but this will not change anything 
for us. 
  I was the one who, from the podium and from above the heads 
of the martyrs, made direct speeches about the president of the 
Republic and the prime minister. I held them responsible for 
the incident and demanded that they resign and leave if justice 
is not meted out in this matter. Some sides described our 
restrained stand after the massacre as being of the highest 
level of heroism. Our enemies described our stand as cowardly 
and hesitant. However, let it be made clear to all: We are the 
ones who maintain public security and general law and order. We 
have no time to waste on bitter condemnations of anyone. We 
have a project that is grander than all the narrow-minded 
political projects and gimmicks: confronting the dangers that 
are looming over our country and nation. Our fight against the 
Zionist enemy is a more noble goal than the fight against the 
insignificant sides. This does not mean, however, that the 
blood of our brothers and people can be shed by a murderous 
group. So far, they have not determined whose responsibility it 
was. Was it the responsibility of the president, the defense 
minister, the prime minister, the interior minister, or the 
security bodies? They have not told us anything clear about 
this matter. They think that the issue will die over time. We 
will address them in the same way that the poet Muhammad Mahdi 
al-Jawahiri addressed the ruler of Iraq when the latter killed 
his brother Ja'far in the Battle of the Bridge in Baghdad: 
  Whether you know it or not, 
  Victims' wounds are a mouth, 
  Unlike that of one giving testimony 
  Or another begging for mercy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Folly of Hate in Lebanon"] </F>
  [Text] The last thing in the world Lebanon would need under 
its present political and economic circumstances is a new round 
of terrorist bombing. But, it seems, some of the opposing 
factions in that country have not as yet learned from the past 
hard experience since they've done it again. A massive bomb 
explosion wrecked the headquarters of the Christian Phalange 
Party in Beirut yesterday (Monday) as a result of which two 
innocent people were killed and dozens of others were injured. 
  The Christian Phalange Party was responsible for some of 
Lebanon's cruellest acts of crime during that country's decade 
and half years old civil war that came to a partial end in 1991. 
But despite their poor past performance record the bombing, or 
the act of planting it, was most unwarranted, a big mistake and 
an act of utmost narrow-mindedness. 
  This latest act of terrorism is bound to breathe new life in 
the old and evil religious and factional animus, and trigger a 
new round of vengefulness, destruction and killing. What is 
most unfortunate is that in this midst a series of most innocent 
people, who have nothing to do with the dirty game of politics 
and political rivalry, will most likely pay the price. 
  In yesterday's bombing two people, including a young boy, 
who 
had nothing to do with the Phalange Party or its activities, 
were killed. Also according to the reports, panic-stricken 
residents of the buildings around the party headquarters shouted 
hysterically as they forced their way through the wreckage to 
find their loved ones. Words alone cannot describe the 
dastardliness and the cruelness of the act. One has to put 
himself in the shoes of those whose loved ones were killed or 
maimed by the bombing to grasp the extent of the crime. Why? 
Why not put the blind evil of hate behind? 
  Bomb attacks were frequent during the civil war, and whether 
the terrorists like to admit it or not, in Lebanon bombings have 
run their course. They are ineffective weapons of persuasion 
and can't make a dent in anybody's mind except perhaps foster 
hatred -- what Lebanon can and must do without. The bombings 
harm everyone including the very people or groups they are 
supposed to help. The experience of using a bomb as a means of 
furthering one's political goal has not been successful in that 
country, and the only thing they have managed to bring about is 
to make the whole of Lebanon measurably poorer, irrespective of 
one's religious or party affiliation. 
  Lebanon is like a boat and all the Lebanese people in it 
will 
either be saved by reaching the shore (of prosperity) or sink 
together. One bad thing about terrorist bombings is that they 
scare off tourists who bring badly needed foreign exchange into 
that country, as well as investments by affluent Lebanese 
expatriates or foreign companies. After all who would want to 
get caught in the crossfire of bombings? 
  Not only that the rich Lebanese, who would want to bring 
their moneys into Lebanon and invest there, would be scared off, 
but also the friendly countries and international lending 
institutions which have made their contributions and loans 
contingent upon progress in the national reconciliation process, 
and in general, Lebanon's peace and stability would be forced to 
have a change of mind. 
  The different Lebanese factions must have learned by now 
that 
Lebanon should have a place for all legitimate religions and 
political religious groups with no exception. And that the 
different factions will have to put their human and material 
resources together if they want to see Lebanon on a development 
course again. 
  Those responsible for the planting of the bomb at the 
Phalange Party headquarters must have not grown enough to 
understand the wastefulness and folly of their act. But one 
thing is plenty clear: Those behind the act are not just the 
enemies of the phalangists but also their own party, clan, 
families, and in short the enemies of Lebanon and every 
individual in it. 
  A word of advice for the phalangists: Nothing in life is as 
sweet as the exercise of prudence and forgiveness. However, 
before they begin thinking about quenching their sense of 
revenge by killing innocent people and destroying their 
life-earned properties, the phalangists should look into their 
own political setup to make sure the bomb was not an inside job 
by the ultra-inept who would like to see a resurgence of 
religious and factional enmity in Lebanon.

  [Text] A responsible Egyptian source said today that the 
visit to Libya by Usamah al-Baz, director of President Mubarak's 
Office for Political Affairs, has not achieved any positive 
results on the fate of Libyan dissident Mansur al-Kikhya, who 
disappeared in Cairo. The same source added that al-Baz received 
no gesture of cooperation from Libyan officials on this issue. 
He noted that al-Kikhya's disappearance is now being handled at 
the security level pending the outcome of an investigation into 
the incident. The source said that Egypt and its people do not 
tolerate anyone harming Egypt's security or its guests. 
  So far, no official statement has been issued on the results 
of al-Baz's visit to Libya. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
said Monday that Egypt's stance on the issue will be determined 
by the outcome of the security agencies' investigations. 
  After al-Baz's return on Tuesday, some deputies asked the 
government to announce the outcome of his mission to Libya and 
the results of investigations. 
  An Arab diplomatic source has clarified that the Egyptian 
Government's silence on al-Baz's visit shows its dissatisfaction 
with Libya and its conviction about that government's 
involvement in al-Kikhya's abduction.

  [Text] Tripoli, 25 Dec -- A source at the General People's 
Committee for Unity denied reports circulated by some mass media 
on the recent (?visit) to the Great Jamahisriyah by Dr. 
(?Usamah) al-Baz, first under secretary at the Egyptian Foreign 
Ministry and director of the Egyptian president's office for 
political affairs. 
  The source confirmed that these reports were [word 
indistinct] untrue, and (?consequently) the mass media reports 
circulated about the issues discussed within this sphere were 
baseless. 
  As for the Lockerbie issue, the source said that Libya has 
nothing to say about this issue, particularly [words indistinct] 
Libya's innocence in it. 
  In connection with the so-called al-Kikhya [Libyan 
opposition 
leader who disappeared in Egypt], the source added that Libya 
has nothing to do with him, and it looks as if he were a victim 
of accounts settled with (?quarters) of the stray dogs he dealt 
with. He held foreign nationality, and his connection with Libya 
was severed years ago. He was not of Libyan origin but from a 
Turkish family which settled in Libya, and we thought that he 
had gone back to his country after the establishment of 
(?people's) power in Libya and after the people started to 
govern themselves, especially since he was from a family [word 
indistinct] which controlled the Libyan people [word indistinct].

<F P=106> [Report by Fayzah Sa'd] </F>
  [Text] Some Western countries have tightened control 
measures around Libyan opposition figures living there, asking 
them to be more careful and cautious in their movements, 
particularly after the mysterious kidnapping in Cairo of former 
Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya. The security agencies 
in many countries have started to take seriously Colonel 
al-Qadhdhafi's threats to liquidate the regime's opposition 
abroad. 
  Following complications in the Lockerbie file and evidence 
of 
the opposition factions' ability to infiltrate Libya and ignite 
rebellion similar to what happened in Misratah, al-Qadhdhafi 
made changes in his security apparati to protect his regime, 
assigning all these jobs to his family members. 
  Colonel al-Qadhdhafi has issued a document, entitled "The 
Revolutionary Legitimacy," which for the first time contains no 
slogans but rather sets out strict security instructions. The 
document was distributed among the big five in Libya: 
'Abd-al-Salam Jallud, Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, Colonel 
Mustafa al-Kharrubi, Abu-Bakr Yunus, in addition to al-Qadhdhafi 
himself. It was a big surprise when 'Ali 'Abd-al-Fadil, 
director of al-Qadhdhafi's bureau, was told that the document 
ordered the reorganization of the security organs as a 
precaution against the difficult days to come due to the 
repercussions of the Lockerbie issue. Accordingly, 
al-Kharrubi's authorities were withdrawn and he was appointed as 
inspector in the armed forces, Defense Minister Abu-Bakr Yunus 
was "given no responsibilities," nor was Major al-Khuwaylidi 
al-Humaydi, who was formerly responsible for foreign, domestic, 
and military security. They were all put at the disposal of the 
colonel, who is to assign them specific tasks. 
  'Abd-al-Salam Jallud's role in the people's congresses was 
restricted. He is said to live in a private house on the Canary 
Islands. His tribe, the al-Mafarihah, has been disarmed, thus 
making them vulnerable to rival tribes like the Durfillis and 
al-Buray'isat. The colonel has succeeded with his 
divide-and-rule policy and in taming the tribal factor and 
exploiting it to serve his regime. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi has set up a security team that supervises all 
security apparati, foreign and domestic, operating in Tripoli. 
Known as the Leader's Information Bureau, the team is comprised 
of presidents of apparati and security consultants. Captain 
Ahmad Ramadan al-Asabi'ah supervises the bureau and he is 
responsible for security, second only to al-Qadhdhafi. He 
studied security in East Germany and Bulgaria and mastered the 
art of planning and preparing. 
  The name Mas'ud 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Qadhdhafi, of the al-Hazrah 
clan--a branch of the al-Qadhdhafi tribe--is prominent as head 
of the "security battalions," selected military units composed 
of airborne troops that surround the big cities. They are 
prepared to abort any rebellion or coup attempt. People close 
to Mas'ud say that he has recruited many young people in the 
cities and that he has strong ties with Rome, Madrid, and 
Ndjamina. 
  According to reports from Libya, 12 personalities are 
threats 
to lead coups against al-Qadhdhafi. These include Mansur 
al-Kikhya and Muhammad al-Maqrif, who resides in America. 
  Reports indicate that the names listed in that (?document) 
will tell the security agencies who kidnapped al-Kikhya in 
Cairo, particularly because al-Qadhdhafi had given instructions 
to kidnap three of his major opponents: Muhammad al-Maqrif, who 
lives in America; Mansur al-Kikhya; and 'Abd-al-Mun'im al-Huni, 
who is living in Cairo at present.

<F P=106> [Speech by Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi from his motorcade </F>
in al-'Ujaylat on 28 December--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Qadhdhafi] In the name of God, O sons of 
al-'Ujaylat, sons of Hamid and Rashid [not further identified]. 
O you who belonged to the movements of the companions [not 
further identified] and owned this land for more than 500 years. 
[passage omitted] 
  O brothers, the Westerners made a terrible mistake when they 
insisted on turning the Lockerbie problem into a political 
issue. If they had thought, if they had learned from lessons, 
they would not have fallen onto that dangerous, slippery path. 
They should have left the Lockerbie case a purely legal issue. 
Then they might have been able to try the suspects, to save 
their shameless faces. They might have been able to avoid the 
pothole they have fallen into if they had not made it a 
political issue. [passage omitted condemning France for 
following U.S.] 
  We are prepared to engage in battle with the imperialists. 
We held up the olive branch, asked for friendship, asked for 
understanding, asked for a peaceful settlement, asked for mutual 
reconciliation and asked for friendship and amity to prevail 
between the peoples, yet, the colonialist and imperialist 
circles are bent on confrontation and clashes. We are for it. 
We are prepared. O America, O France, O Britain, we are 
prepared for the confrontation. We are prepared to clash. 
[passage omitted] 
  We reject any infringement of our sovereignty, any harm to 
our citizens and any violation of our national law. Libyan law 
is above the law of the United Nations. Libyan law is above 
international law, because it concerns Libya's sovereignty and 
its right to live freely on its territory. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Rifat Saeed: "Al-Zulfiqar: Past, Present, and </F>
Future"] 
  [Text] Before we detail the past and future of the 
al-Zulfiqars, it is important that the readers know that there 
has been no difference in the activities of these invisible 
forces since the fall of former Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali 
Bhutto in 1987, and now. There seem to be no difference in the 
formation of al-Zulfiqar and its influence, the Punjabi-Pukhtoon 
Alliance, G. M. Syed and the Sindhi Nationalist Organization, 
and the formation of the MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] and Iltaf 
Hussein's political style. All these organizations play a role 
in the same drama and are instruments in the hands of the same 
force. 
  After Murtaza Bhutto's return to Pakistan, it seems that 
armed terrorism in this country has ended, and political 
terrorism has started. Dr. Qadir Magsi, leader of Jiye Sindh 
movement, is talking about establishing law and order in Sindh 
and getting rid of the robbers after his mysterious release from 
jail. Murtaza Bhutto, the head of al-Zulfiqar, talked before and 
after his arrest about ending al-Zulfiqar's activities and of 
his desire to play the role of a patriotic political leader. 
Meanwhile, Iltaf Hussein, leader of the MQM, is giving up 
communal politics and is talking about a united national 
political movement. It seems that some of these forces are 
moving the energy of armed terrorists toward political 
terrorism, in order to show the nation that they have taken away 
weapons from the terrorists and have included them in the 
national political mainstream. The one and only purpose for this 
plan is to continue using their followers in their future 
political activities, so that our nation is not self-reliant in 
the political and economic arenas. These forces wanted to 
maintain their control in the name of establishing law and order. 
  When Benazir Bhutto took power in 1988, there was the 
possibility of Murtaza Bhutto's return; however, she tried to 
keep Murtaza Bhutto scared for her own vested interests, and 
gave the impression to her younger brother that if he put his 
foot on Pakistan's land, it would mean signing his own death 
sentence. This way, Benazir Bhutto put in Murtaza Bhutto's mind 
a fear of intelligence agencies and other top agencies in our 
country. Thus, he could not dare return home in the past. During 
this period, Jam-i Sadiq Ali and Mustafa Khan, who are both 
traitors and were involved in conspiracies against the army, 
managed to return home, and even to become Cabinet members. 
  A special aspect of the cases against Murtaza Bhutto is the 
legal loopholes involved in these. According to legal experts, 
Murtaza Bhutto perhaps will not be punished in any of the cases 
against him; however, intelligence agencies have proof of 
Murtaza Bhutto's involvement in terrorism. If these are 
presented in court, then Murtaza Bhutto will be in serious 
trouble. However, these agencies may need Murtaza Bhutto's 
services for some reason, and it would be impossible to present 
proof of his involvement in terrorism. According to high-level 
police officials, there are 72 witnesses listed in connection 
with the case registered in Ferozabad, but 15 years have passed, 
and some of these witnesses have died. Others have retired, and 
some of them will not be willing to testify against the brother 
of the prime minister. It is feared that Murtaza Bhutto will win 
in the legal wars, because in Pakistan witnesses and proof are 
very important in criminal cases. The most important fact is 
that the judge of the special court where the case against 
Murtaza Bhutto is registered has been transferred. He was a 
former judge in the Sindh High Court. 
  How and when was al-Zulfiqar established? PPP [Pakistan 
People's Party] supporters and opponents have different opinions 
about it. When the late Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto fell from power and 
was arrested on 16 September 1977 at Larkana, he, after a 
decision in the case against him for murdering Nawab Mohammed 
Ahmed Khan, understood the seriousness of the situation and sent 
both his sons--Mir Murtaza Bhutto and Shah Nawaz Bhutto--abroad. 
In the end Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was sentenced to be hanged. 
General Zia rejected even his last appeal for mercy. On that 
day, Murtaza Bhutto decided to establish al-Zulfiqar and declare 
General Ziaul Haq his target. Among the targets of al-Zulfiqar 
there are many VIPs, as well as prominent politicians, judges, 
and high-level civil and military officers. The first target of 
the al-Zulfiqar was the hijacking of the PIA [Pakistan 
International Airlines] Boeing PK 326 on 2 March 1981. This 
plane was going to Peshawar with 148 passengers in it, including 
three women. This plane was hijacked to Kabul. When the 
hijackers sent their demands to the government of Pakistan, it 
was learned that they were members of the al-Zulfiqar terrorist 
organization, whose leader was Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's son, 
Murtaza Bhutto. This plane was in the hijackers' control for 13 
days, and 54 persons were released from jail, as per the demands 
of the hijackers, and sent to Damascus. There were only three 
hijackers. These included Salam Allah Tipu, Nasir Jamal, and 
Arshad Ali. In an interview with international media, Murtaza 
Bhutto admitted that Salam Allah Tipu was his man. Murtaza 
Bhutto was in continued contact with the hijackers, who were 
following his instructions. Hijacker Tipu, at Murtaza's 
instruction, shot Major Tariq Rahim in the neck at Murtaza 
Bhutto's command and threw his body out of the airplane onto the 
runway. He later sent a message to the control tower to pick up 
Tariq Rahim's body. An important member of the hijacked plane's 
crew said that he still trembles when thinking about this 
hijacking incident. He also said that it seemed that the Kabul 
government was supporting the hijackers fully. Otherwise, it 
would not have been possible to have control of the hijackers 
for such a long time. The PIA hijacking was registered as FIR 
211-81 on 2 March 1981 under 120-B, 364,302,109 PPC at Crime 
Circle I. In this case, Malik Ayub, son of PPI Manager Malik 
Ghulam Sarwar; Saif Allah Khalid; Isa Baloch; and Nasir Baloch 
were arrested while Salam Allah Tipu, Nasir Jamal, Arshad Ali, 
Murtaza Bhutto, and Shah Nawaz Bhutto were declared absconding. 
The four persons listed above were given death sentences, which 
were later changed to 25 years of hard labor after their 
appeals. Later, Malik Ayub's father, Sarwar, and Saif Allah's 
father, Mohammed Ali Johar, managed to contact Ziaul Haq. They 
managed to get a pardon from him. However, Nasir Baloch refused 
to ask for any kind of pardon, and he was sentenced to be hanged. 
  The notorious al-Zulfiqar terrorists, Salam Allah Tipu and 
Nasir Jamal, and Arshad Ali were accused of murdering a Jamia 
Karachi student and member of Islamic Jamiat-i tulba, Hafiz 
Mohammed Aslam, six days before they hijacked the plane. This 
report was registered under FIR 47-8, Explosion Act, case number 
302-34 PPC 3-5, at Gulshan Iqbal Police Station. Tipu himself 
has admitted to murdering Aslam while talking from the control 
tower. The same day (26 February 1991), these three people were 
also involved in a robbery in the Bahadarabad region. This 
robbery was reported under FIR 35-81 as case number 17 (3) (EHO) 
at the Bahadarabad Police Station. 
  The terrorists of al-Zulfiqar also robbed a showroom on 
University Road in New Town on 13 November 1980. Saif Allah 
Khalid, Hanif Patel, Mohammed Tariq Cheena, and Salam Allah Tipu 
were all involved. This was registered in the New Town Police 
Station as case number 17 (3) (EHO), under FIR 43-80. 
  On 19 March 1981, the New Town police arrested Saif Allah 
Khalid at Crescent Motors on University Road and registered case 
number FIR 81-54 under 307-33-34 PPC. 
  On 30 November 1980, Saif Allah Khalid, Hanif Patel, and 
Salam Allah Tipu were involved in a robbery and theft of a 
government rifle, and the case was registered under 17 (3) 
(EHO), case number FIR 534-80. They were arrested and were 
sentenced in a military court. Similarly, a sub-machine gun with 
60 cartridges was recovered from another al-Zulfiqar terrorist, 
named Islamuddin, on 24 April 1982. This case was registered as 
FIR 222-82, under Article 13D, at the Liaqatabad Police Station. 
  On 20 November 1981, the police received information about a 
flat in the federal capital area, stating that some al-Zulfiqar 
terrorists were hiding there. The police raided the flat the 
terrorists fired at the police resulting in the death of one 
police officer, Aslam Kiani, and one terrorist, Lala Asad. 
Rukhshar Qureshi was arrested. This case was registered as 
568/81 under 302/224/225/218 Penal Codes at the Liaqatabad 
Police Station. Later, these terrorists were sentenced in the 
Military Court. 
  On 14 November 1980, al-Zulfiqar terrorists Saif Allah 
Khalid, Salam Allah Tipu, Nasir Jamal, Arshad Ali, and Hanif 
Patel seized a government car, tag number GT 1877, from one Dr. 
Yusuf, and used it in a robbery incident. The case was 
registered as FIR 125/80 under 17 (3) (EHO) Penal Code at the 
Gulshan Iqbal Police Station. 
  Accused Saif Allah Khalid and hijacker Arshad Ali joined 
Lala 
Asad and Lala Aslam in robbing a showroom at gunpoint on Sharah 
Qaideen on 14 February 1981. This case was registered as 59/81 
under 17 (3) (EHO) Penal Code at the Ferozabad Police Station. 
  Murtaza Bhutto has also admitted to murdering Zahurulhasan 
Bhopali. Ayaz Samon, Ilias Saddiqi, and Javed Malik were also 
involved in this murder. Ayaz Samon was later hanged, while 
Ilias Saddiqi was killed on site by his friend's bullets. This 
case was registered at the Ferozabad Police Station. The police 
personnel at Brigade arrested an important PPP leader, Masrur 
Ahsan, and recovered proof of anti-national activities from his 
person. 
  Another al-Zulfiqar terrorist, Aftab Ahmed Meman, was 
arrested by the Gulbarg police, and weapons were recovered from 
him. He admitted before a magistrate that he was a member of 
al-Zulfiqar, and that he was given the responsibility of 
assassinating an important person. He said that he was arrested 
before he could do his job. This case was registered at the 
Gulbarg Police Station as FIR 330/81, under 13 D Penal Code. 
  Another al-Zulfiqar terrorist, Ghulam Mustafa, was arrested 
by Quetta's Crime Branch Police at the border when he entered 
Pakistan from Afghanistan. He was presented before a magistrate 
first class, where he admitted that he was an active member of 
al-Zulfiqar and had returned after involvement in some 
subversive activities in Kabul. 
  The story of al-Zulfiqar's terrorist activity is very long 
and scary. Now that the leader of this terrorist organization 
has returned to Pakistan, the government and other forces should 
make sure that these terrorists are punished, and that they do 
not find ways to avoid punishment. The details of the terrorist 
activities of al-Zulfiqar given above were gleaned from a report 
at the Ferozabad Police Station. Murtaza Bhutto has admitted to 
more than one terrorist act staged by his organization, 
al-Zulfiqar. It was learned after the arrests of most of the 
members of his organization that Murtaza Bhutto used to come to 
Delhi to attend the oath-taking ceremony of his members after 
they had finished training. Murtaza Bhutto, after the airplane 
accident in which General Ziaul Haq was killed, admitted in an 
interview with international news media that he had attacked 
Ziaul Haq six times, all without success.

  [Text] Khartoum, 27 Dec (MENA)--Sudanese diplomatic sources 
have criticized what they called provocation by the U.S. Embassy 
in Khartoum, which presented awards to the families of Sudanese 
citizens in appreciation of their efforts during the U.S. 
humanitarian aid operations, despite a Sudanese criminal court 
condemning these activities. 
  The official newspaper AL-INQADH AL-WATANI cited the sources 
as saying that the Sudanese Government does not want to respond 
to the U.S. provocation and has agreed to form a committee to 
discuss the trial's legal procedures.

  [Text] Rostov-on-Don, 23 Dec -- At approximately 1135 [0835 
GMT] today, four armed bandits in bulletproof jackets and 
camouflage uniforms and armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles 
burst into the ninth "C" form of Rostov's School No. 25 which is 
located practically in the city center. After firing into the 
ceiling, the criminals seized a female teacher and 12 
schoolchildren and led them out to a bus standing outside the 
school. The bus was then driven by a driver, also taken 
hostage, in the direction of a military camp. 
  One of a number of servicemen who began negotiations with 
the 
kidnappers was himself taken hostage. The kidnappers demanded a 
helicopter and crew and talked about "Georgia-Makhachkala-Iran" 
as a preliminary route. 
  According to unsubstantiated data, the terrorists have 
released one of the female pupils. They have called for the 
oblast's administrative head, Vladimir Chub, to take part in 
negotiations. Negotiations are continuing.

returned and has been hovering over the airport since then, the

  Saipudi Khasanov stressed that he was ready to go on board 
himself to free the children. Russian authorities negotiating 
with the terrorists have been notified about this proposal of 
the Groznyy authorities prompted by their concern about the

  [Excerpts] Moscow December 24 TASS -- Bad weather prevented 
the Mi-8 helicopter of the Russian Air Force where terrorists 
are staying with a group of children taken hostage from flying 
to Makhachkala, the capital of the Russian Republic of 
Daghestan, bordering on Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea, TASS 
learned from the press centre of the Russian Air Force which 
added that kidnappers planned to refuel in Makhachkala and fly 
to Iran. 
  The air force experts believe one of the terrorists has a 
certain flying experience which is proved by the demand to

  [Excerpts] Moscow December 25 TASS -- Terrorists who are 
staying with hostages aboard a helicopter in the Mineralnyye 
Vody airport said they will take off after dark. The kidnappers 
are still holding up three boys, a bus driver and two pilots. 
  As soon as weathermen announced that the weather permitted 
flight, the terrorists ordered the helicopter to be tugged by a 
tractor to a remote runway. [passage omitted] 
  The four terrorists have not been identified yet. Officials 
said the computer sketches of them are available and a photofit 
picture of one of the kidnappers, made with the help of the 
teenager hostages and their teacher which were freed on Friday 
(one boy was freed Saturday morning) in return for a $10 million 
ransom, was shown on Russian television. 
  Officials hope that some of the televiewers will be able to 
identify the terrorists and supply additional data that may help 
to free the remaining hostages. [passage omitted] 
  ITAR-TASS correspondent in Rostov-on-Don, where nine 
teenagers and their teacher were kidnapped on Thursday, quoted 
the school principal as saying that the terrorists declared that 
they all were AIDS-infected and are going abroad for medical 
treatment. They also promised the hostages to give them money 
and take them abroad. 
  The principal, Valentina Fedoseyeva, said that "the children 
burst into laughter when three masked men armed with assault 
rifles burst into their class." They thought it was a joke 
staged by their military instructor and only after the attackers 
fired three rounds into the ceiling did the children realise it 
was serious.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Dec (ITAR-TASS) -- After a tractor towed 
the helicopter with the terrorists and hostages to another 
runway at the Mineralnyye Vody airport today, another schoolboy, 
Zhenya Mezhuyev, was released. Thus two boys, the bus driver, 
and the helicopter's two pilots are still on board. The 
terrorists have declared they intend to leave Mineralnyye Vody 
when darkness sets in. [passage omitted] 
  The terrorists promise to release the two boys remaining on 
board, having set as a condition that Valentina Petrenko, 
personal envoy of the Russian foreign minister, should be taken 
on board. [passage omitted] 
  It is not excluded that after flying to Baku the terrorists 
will try to land in the mountains where it is possible that 
accomplices await them.

  [Text] After two hours' flight, the helicopter carrying the 
terrorists and hostages returned to Mineralnyye Vody airport. 
Here is our correspondent Valeriy Kuts. 
  [Kuts, in progress as heard] ...by Moscow time, the Mi-8TM 
helicopter with the terrorists and hostages on board took off, 
circled the airport and town several times, and headed off for 
the town of Makhachkala, but because of heavy icing, the 
helicopter had to return to the airport at the town of 
Mineralnyye Vody, where it landed at 0240 Moscow time [2340 
GMT]. Evidently officials of law and order bodies will once 
more attempt to make contact with the criminals at dawn in order 
to establish their further plans. Valeriy Kuts, information 
service.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The public relations center of 
the Russian Interior Ministry gives some details. At 0500 GMT 
the terrorists demanded vodka and a new helicopter since they 
think the engine of the one they are on is faulty. Contact with 
the criminals is still one-sided and is taking place on their 
initiative only. According to information at 0800 GMT, the 
helicopter is on a runway. There is no movement around it. The 
food demanded by the terrorists has been brought on board the 
helicopter. This is the information as of this hour. As new 
reports from our correspondents on the spot arrive, we will 
report them to you in Ostankino Novosti bulletins.

  [Text] Makhachkala, 27 Dec -- All four terrorists who 
kidnapped hostages in Rostov-on-Don on 23 December have been 
identified. The leader of the gang is Arslan Kasimov, born in 
1945, a native of Azerbaijan, who has a criminal record. 
Abdulgafar Abduzhalimov, a native of Tashkent, born in 1972, is 
a fifth-year student at the faculty of applied mechanics of 
Tashkent University. Anatoliy Mikheyev, born in 1949, a native 
of Sverdlovsk, Russia, is a navigator by profession and was 
discharged from the Air Force for drunkenness; recently he has 
been unemployed. The fourth thug is Marat Kauzbekov, born in 
1974, native of Tashkent, a Kazakh and second-year student at 
Tashkent Institute of Architecture. 
  Nearly all of the $10 million handed over to the terrorists 
has been recovered, except for a small sum which, according to 
gang leader Arslan Kasimov, was thrown out of the helicopter 
over Chechen territory.

  [Text] The INTERFAX agency reports that the terrorist 
hijackers captured in Makhachkala yesterday are still in 
Dagestan. They are being held in remand cells and will be 
transferred to Rostov-on-Don in the near future. 
  An Interior Ministry official reports that during 
interrogation it emerged that the terrorists carefully planned 
their action. In particular, they thoroughly reconnoitered the 
airports at Georgiyevsk and Stravropol. Some experts think that 
if the criminals had managed to land at the intended point on 
the border with Chechnya, there would have been very little 
chance of catching them. 
  Moreover, it has emerged that during one of the 
interrogation 
sessions former military pilot Anatoliy Mikheyev said there was 
a certain organization behind the groups' actions and that it 
had helped plan the crime.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that the 
act of terrorism with schoolchildren taken hostage in 
Rostov-on-Don last week was carefully planned. 
  Meeting in Moscow Tuesday with the pilots who voluntarily 
manned the helicopter carrying the kidnappers, Grachev said that 
the terrorists were greeted by a car and a helicopter. 
  Grachev has said that after the terrorists chose a 
helicopter 
as a means of transport, it became clear that they were going 
neither to Iran nor to Turkey. He said that the pilots managed 
to fool the terrorists and land the helicopter at another place 
which helped their prompt detention. 
  Journalists were informed of the terrorists' plans. They 
planned to make a false landing in the Chechen Republic, then, 
by using radio silence, to fly over to Khasavyurt (Dagestan) 
where they were being awaited by their accomplices and a 
transportation means for escape. However, the pilots spotted 
the helicopter on the ground and altered the course of their 
chopper. Bad weather conditions helped the pilots to deceive 
the hijackers and they landed in the suburb of Makhachkala. 
  Congratulating the pilots, Grachev said that the 
helicopter's 
chief pilot, Valentin Padalka, and he fought in Afghanistan for 
almost one year. The minister also said President Yeltsin 
instructed him to give the pilots high state awards. 
  The minister said by their heroic deed Russian pilots raised 
even higher the country's prestige in the international arena. 
During the operation, he said, the army showed cohesion and 
that it was able to accomplish difficult tasks. That is why all 
attempts to disintegrate the army will only weaken it, he said. 
  The minister said that it is planned to complete the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from abroad.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Modestov report: "A Unique Incident -- So Declared </F>
Russian First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets at a Press Conference 
Held After the Release of the Hostages"] 
  [Excerpts] The situation's uniqueness consisted not only in 
the technical parameters of the helicopter, which were unusual 
for this type of crime -- the single entrance door to the craft, 
the maneuverability in flight, the cramped and enclosed nature 
of the cabin -- but also in the large number of schoolchildren 
seized by the terrorists, and the professionalism of one of the 
bandits (who was a former military pilot), as well as the degree 
to which the criminals were armed, and their aggressiveness. 
[passage omitted] Suffice it to say that the gang's ringleader 
has three criminal convictions, and one of its members was tried 
for rape. Oleg Soskovets also noted the courage and endurance of 
the pilots. 
  The main responsibility for dealing with the gang lay with 
those subordinate to First Deputy Internal Affairs Minister 
Mikhail Yegorov. However, all the heads of oblasts and the 
rayons in the North Caucasus, even of those regions where a 
state of emergency is currently in force, took part in resolving 
the situation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The four terrorists arrested last Monday in the 
outskirts of Makhachkala, Dagestan, were brought on Wednesday 
night to Rostov-on-Don, where they kidnapped a group of 
schoolchildren last week. The Rostov Interior Department 
informed INTERFAX that the terrorists were being detained at a 
preliminary investigation prison in the city. The investigation 
is expected to continue in the new year. 
  According to INTERFAX reporters, on Thursday the local 
administration is planning a reception for the participants in 
the operation to release the hostages. 
  Meanwhile, the Chechen Interior Ministry has informed 
INTERFAX that not a single dollar banknote has been found on the 
territory of the Chechen republic: The terrorists claimed that 
they scattered banknotes flying over the republic. Earlier 
reports said several banknotes were found near Mineralnyye Vody. 
It is believed that the terrorists scattered the banknotes when 
they flew on a helicopter from Mineralnyye Vody to Makhachkala 
with the purpose of misleading law enforcement bodies.

  [Text] Baku, December 27 (TURAN)--Yesterday the first ever 
conference of Boz Gurd Party (Grey Wolves), which used to be a 
movement, took place. 
  The conference adopted a program and Charter for the party. 
The party builds its program in accordance with that Azerbaijan 
has entered a period of construction and development under 
circumstances of conflict between geopolitical expansionist 
interests of the great powers. The aim of the party is to build 
a democratic and free national state. The party assumes the 
responsibility of guarantor of security of the nation under 
conditions of its growth within the framework of its historical 
borders. The party opposes any form of dictatorship, violence, 
and violation of human rights and lauds a cultural and spiritual 
renaissance of the nation. 
  Where national and territorial security are concerned, Boz 
Gurd will, within the framework of the international norms, will 
struggle for the return of historical Azeri territories that had 
been granted to other nations by the Russian empire. The main 
goal of the future is the liberation of Armenian-occupied 
territories. 
  The party calls for a complete and rapid conversion to a 
market economy with different forms of property. 
  In the article on national policy, the party's Charter 
requires that the party respect the rights, national feelings, 
and religious views of all nations, which do not pose a threat 
to the Azerbaijani state. 
  As for the main goals in foreign policy, the Boz Gurd seeks 
to strengthen Azerbaijan's position in the international 
community. 
  The party respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity 
of states and comes out for the development of bilateral, 
mutually beneficial relations with other states. In particular, 
relations with other Turkic states are stressed. The Boz Gurd 
party intends to assist Turkic nations in the struggle towards 
independence. 
  According to the Charter of the party, both the citizens of 
Azerbaijan, as well as Azeris living abroad may be members. The 
membership may be of an individual or collective nature. 
Joining and leaving the party may be done at free will. The 
party relies on donations by members of the party, staff, and 
other private citizens. The members of the party will also be 
required to carry out its Charter's decrees. 
  The party structures its activities according to the 
territorial-administrative divisions of Azerbaijan. That is, 
village and city entities consisting of not less than 10 
members. The departments are united into regional and city 
branches. The highest supreme body of the divisions consist of 
conferences which will be held not less than once a year. The 
departments created abroad are called affiliates or branches. 
  The supreme body of the party is the congress. It is 
summoned once in three years. The urgent congress may be 
summoned on the demand of chairman, as well as the more than 
half the members of the party. The congress elects a chairman 
of the party and its supreme bodies-political bureau [11 
people], control revision committee. Political bureau headed by 
the chairman guides the party during the period between the two 
congresses, the chairman represents the party and shoulders the 
responsibility before the party. The organ of the party is BOZ 
GURD newspaper. 
  The head of Boz Gurd movement, Iskander Hamidov, refused to 
become a chairman of the party at the conference. Professor of 
history Bahdiyar Ahmedov is the chairman. As Hamidov said, he 
is elected a coordinator of the world-wide Boz Gurd organization. 
  The party announced itself to be the collective member of 
the 
Popular Front of Azerbaijan. 
  The conference itself to be the collective member of the 
Popular [People's] Front of Azerbaijan. 
  The conference came out with a statement, declaring itself

relatives and friends became the scourge of Azerbaijan. The 
conference qualified Azerbaijan's joining the CIS negatively.

  [Text] Baku, December 27 (TURAN)--At the recent founders' 
conference of the Boz Gurd Party, Bahdiar Ahmedov, a professor 
of history from the Baku University, was elected chairman of the 
party yesterday. 
  He was born in 1936 in the village of Govlar in the Tauzskiy 
region in the western part of the country. He graduated from 
the faculty of history of the Azerbaijan State University. He 
is a doctor of history, is married and has four children. 
  I joined the democratic movement five years ago at its very 
inception, Ahmedov said. Many who have been taught the Turkic 
traditions by myself are among the members of the party. 
  The professor believes that Abulfaz Elchibey and Iskander 
Hamidov are the most respectable politicians of Azerbaijan. 
  After Iskander Hamidov's resignation from the post of 
minister of interior, I became his close confidant and supporter 
in the Boz Gurd movement. 
  The theme of his masters' dissertation was Azeri-British 
relations in the 16th century. It dealt with the policy of 
England in the East during the first half of the 17th century 
(the beginning of England's colonial policy) the slogan of 
Bahdiyar Akhmedov is -- children must take care [sentence

<F P=106> [Article by Marek Dreving: "Mart Laar: A Ruthless War on </F>
Crime Has Started"] 
  [Text] The battle against crime is the most fundamental 
task facing the government, testified Prime Minister Mart Laar 
at yesterday's press conference. A police investigation directed 
against terrorist activity is under the personal control of the 
prime minister. All materials from the investigation of the bomb 
blast that occurred in front of the Kadrioru police department 
are being turned over to the prime minister. 
  As is known, an explosion occurred the evening of November 
14 
in Tallinn in front of the Kadrioru police department, which 
injured two policemen and demolished three police patrol cars. 
On 28 October, a bomb exploded at 10:25 p.m. in front of the 
same police department, which destroyed two police cars. 
  "The explosions demonstrate that the Estonian police have 
started to feel open to attack. Earlier there wasn't any thought 
of bombing the police, but now evidently the need to intimidate 
the police has arisen," explained Laar. 
  The fight against crime is one of the most important tasks 
for 1994, assured the prime minister. "It's reason to believe 
that a merciless war with criminals has started," noted Laar. 
The prime minister assured that the state would provide for its 
police officers, who had suffered injuries in the attacks 
against the police. In the words of the prime minister, the 
families of these police officers would be cared for as well. 
  An allotment of Israeli purchased arms will go towards 
replacing police weapons. 
  "In connection with the bomb explosions of the Kadrioru 
police department building, Tallinn Police Commissioner is doing 
all that is possible in finding those responsible for this crime 
and restoring law and security in the city," a representative 
from the Tallinn Police Commissioner's Press Department told the 
ETA. 
  The Tallinn criminal investigation department is currently 
checking on several possible theories in a joint effort with 
representatives of the Defense Police. In their operation, the 
Commissioner's criminal investigators have discovered 8 
kilograms illegally held explosives, weapons and detonators. 
Twelve people have been arrested. Their involvement with the 
bombing is being verified. 
  Tallinn police commissioner Ralf Palo added, that 
considering 
the extraordinary occurrence, a 5,000-10,000 kroon reward is 
being offered to anyone who can inform the police of crucially 
important facts in one's possession which can aid in the 
investigation of the explosions. Anonymity is guaranteed.

  [Excerpt] [no dateline as received] A statement from the 
Security Ministry of the Republic of Georgia: On 24 December 
the alarm was raised at the order of the Defense Ministry of the 
Republic of Georgia. Defense Ministry units were deployed in 
Tbilisi and carried out a number of single-minded measures 
immediately against the Security Ministry employees; in 
particular, they detained without any grounds two operational 
vehicles armed with special equipment and the employees sitting 
in the vehicles. They confiscated the employees' duty arms and 
uniforms. They physically assaulted the employees, one of them 
by the defense minister himself. One truck was also detained. 
  Additional Defense Ministry forces were ordered to occupy 
two 
adjacent Security Ministry buildings and deployed at the 
military academy. 
  A blast took place at 0437 [0137 GMT] 25 December on the 
Security Ministry gruonds. A large amount of explosives was 
detonated and two Security Ministry employees were wounded, one 
seriously. 
  Extensive material damage was sustained: the Security 
Ministry buildings, the military academy, the 
hydrometeorological center, and some adjacent buildings, as well 
as some special operational equipment and private cars were also 
damaged. 
  In connection with the blast, the Procurator's Office of the 
Republic of Georgia has launched a criminal investigation. 
  The Security Ministry of the Republic of Georgia is 
appealing 
to the head of state, parliament, the government, and the 
general population to condemn such single-minded provocative 
actions aimed at the special service. Moreover, the ministry 
wants to give this instance a political qualification and charge 
the organizers of the illegal actions with criminal 
responsibility. The ministry says that this action was directly 
or indirectly intended to interfere with the Security Ministry's 
work in combatting crime at this critical stage of Georgia's 
statehood. [passage omitted calling for calm]

  [Text] People living in Aghmashenebeli Prospekt and 
neighboring areas, were awakened by a large pre-dawn explosion 
today. It has emerged that an unidentified criminal or group of 
criminals set off two large explosions. 
  We think that what you can see on your screens requires no 
comment. 
  The explosion seriously damaged not only the building of one 
of the Security Ministry's services, but also the neighboring 
buildings of the Meteorological Center of the Academy of 
Sciences and the Defense Ministry's Military Academy. 
Fortunately, neither the students at the Military Academy, nor 
the security service officials on a night shift in the building 
were injured. 
  The material damage is probably worth hundreds of millions

  [Text] Tbilisi December 25 TASS -- Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze has ordered an investigation into the causes of the 
incidents that started the conflict between the republican 
Defense and Security Ministries. 
  The move followed the statements of the two ministries made 
earlier today in which they traded charges for the growing 
conflict. 
  The conflict started with a clash between Defense Minister 
Georgiy Karkarashvili and Security Minister Igor Georgadze in 
Tbilisi airport on Friday upon the return from the CIS summit in 
Ashgabat. But on Saturday it received an unexpected 
continuation in the form of a powerful bomb explosion in one of 
the Security Ministry facilities in the centre of Tbilisi. 
Experts said the explosion was so powerful that its effect 
could be equal to an explosion of a large ammunition depot. No 
casualties or damage were reported. Officials have not come up 
with any explanation of the accident so far. 
  These incidents have brought the situation in Tbilisi to a 
head, Shevardnadze said. "In conditions of the state of 
emergency any sign of confrontation between the Defense Ministry 
and the state security system causes rightful indignation of the 
people. They demand that an end be put to the irresponsibility 
in all sections of the executive branch," the statement said. 
  Shevardnadze set up a special commission led by Prime 
Minister Otar Pastastia to carry out the investigation.

  [Text] Moscow December 27 TASS -- Regional armed units are 
being engaged to fight terrorists in Georgia, an official from 
the Georgian Interior Ministry told ITAR-TASS by telephone on 
Monday. 
  The units were created by a decree of Eduard Shevardnadze 
and 
will help local law enforcement bodies to disarm illegal armed 
groups and to carry out operations against criminal gangs and 
mafia clans on the territory of the republic. 
  TASS learned from a source in the headquarters resolving 
emergency situations in western Georgia that for the last week 
only police had halted activities of four big armed gangs which 
had been for a long time attacking local residents, policemen 
and administrators.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Moller and Mikkel Thrane: "New Arrest in </F>
Bombing Case"] 
  [Text] Terrorism: At a closed hearing yesterday a 
31-year-old Kurd was ordered held in solitary confinement for 13 
days. 
  Security police in Copenhagen yesterday arrested a man 
suspected of having participated in one of three attacks against 
Turkish targets in Copenhagen on 4 November at 1130. 
  This attack apparently was carried out in coordination with 
other terrorist bombings in different places of Europe. 
  The 31-year-old Kurd, who is a Turkish citizen, was arrested 
Thursday [25 November] at the asylum center in Auderod after his 
fingerprints were found on a lighter recovered near the Turkish 
Economic and Trade Center on Borger street in Copenhagen. He 
pleads not guilty. 
  On the day after the attacks a 19-year-old Kurd, who has 
applied for asylum, was arrested, admitting to throwing rocks at 
the Turkish Airline. 
  Having arrested the 31-year-old, the Danish police are the 
only ones in Europe to have in custody two suspects who can be 
connected to the wave of terrorist attacks. 
  No organization has stepped forward claiming responsibility 
for the attacks attempted in Copenhagen and directed against the 
Turkish Information Office, the Turkish Airline, and the Turkish 
Economic and Trade Center. 
  However, the Kurdish rebel movement PKK [Kurdish Workers 
Party] and the Kurdish Labor Party are suspected of being behind 
it, because, among other things, the attacks in Copenhagen 
coincided with the movement's attacks in a number of other 
places in Europe. 
  Yesterday the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared 
PKK 
and 33 other Kurdish organizations illegal effective 
immediately; however, the Danish minister of justice, Erling 
Olsen, refuses to take such a drastic step.

  [Text] Foreigners and resettlers were the targets of 
attacks that occurred in Brandenburg and Schleswig-Holstein over 
the Christmas holidays. Police say no one was injured in the 
attacks. Following an attempted bombing attack on an 
asylum-seeker's home in Hohenstein-Steckenroth, Hesse, an arrest 
warrant was issued for a man who has confessed to the incident. 
The 20-year-old man said his motive was a hatred of foreigners. 
  According to police, a fire in an asylum-seekers' home in 
Nuremberg, in which one Turkish man died, was an accident that 
had no political background.

  [Text] The Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution [BfV] is sounding the alarm: Foreign terrorists 
are carrying out attacks in Germany with increasing frequency -- 
as a protest against oppression in their homelands. The BfV 
says in a confidential report: German targets are "increasingly 
aimed at by foreign groups that are ready to use violence." 
  Terrorists from abroad: The BfV is warning against the 
following groups: 
  -- Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK (banned since November): 
It has "repeatedly voiced threats against the Federal 
Government" and receives "support from the German left-wing 
extremist scene." 
  -- Lebanese Hizballah (Party of God): It was reportedly 
involved in the assassination of four Kurdish functionaries in 
Berlin. 
  -- Islamic extremists: They are supported by, for example, 
Iran and Libya. They persecute and kill critics and opposition 
members. Says the BfV report: "The constitutional protection 
authorities have repeatedly managed to prevent attempts to 
assassinate opposition members." 
  -- Indian Sikhs: They are fighting for their own state in 
the Indian Punjab. Sikhs who live in our country have 
reportedly carried out an attack on the Indian ambassador in 
Romania. 
  -- Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE): Terrorists from 
Sri Lanka are reportedly extorting donations from their 
compatriots in Germany. Twenty investigations are underway. 
  -- Serbian and Croatian groups: According to the BfV, 
clashes between extremist members of these two ethnic groups are 
becoming more and more frequent.

  [Text] Karlsruhe (DPA) -- A group called "27 June Movement 
-- Georg von Rauch Commando" has claimed responsibility for the 
fatal car accident of the Hesse CDU [Christian Democratic Union] 
politician Bernhard Saelzer on 18 December. The federal 
prosecutor's office announced today in Karlsruhe, in response to 
an inquiry, that it has started investigations into persons 
unknown suspected of setting up a terrorist organization and 
supporting the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF). 
  In a letter claiming responsibility, which was made 
available 
to WIESBADENER TAGBLATT, it said: "It was no accident, even 
though it looked like one. We manipulated his Mercedes 300 SE 
in such a way that it was impossible to tell what caused 
Saelzer's accident despite the most thorough of examinations." 
  On 27 June this year, the operation aimed at finding the RAF 
members Wolfgang Grams and Birgit Hogefeld took place in Bad 
Kleinen. Georg von Rauch was shot in December 1971 in west 
Berlin during the search for members of the Baader-Meinhof 
group, the predecessor of the RAF.

<F P=106> [Article signed PSM: "Huge Arms Catch in the </F>
Netherlands--Yves Otte Involved"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Amsterdam, 23 Dec (ANP/BELGA) -- During an 
investigation into a gang of criminals, Dutch police forces 
discovered a huge arms arsenal in the adjoining garage of a 
house in Zwanenburg (Netherlands). The catch includes 45 kg of 
Semtex explosives. 
  Six Dutchmen and two Belgians were arrested. From a 
statement issued by the Dutch press agency ANP, it can be 
concluded that the gangster Yves Otte was involved in the case. 
Otte was shot by the state police in Hoogstraten [Belgium] on 
10 December. 
  According to the police, which presented its investigation 
in 
Amsterdam on Thursday, the weapons, most of them from former 
Yugoslavia, were hidden in a lubrication pit converted into a 
hideout. 
  In addition to the plastic explosives, the catch also 
included 81 detonators, 36 hand grenades, 25 handguns, 10 
so-called Brisant missiles (antitank guns), and a few thousand 
cartridges of 45 different calibers. Several kilograms of 
cocaine, amphetamines, and XTC were also found. 
  The Dutch police arrested six suspects, all of them Dutch 
citizens. The Belgian state police arrested two suspects, who 
were wanted for a number of armed robberies. 
  One of the arrests resulted in a shootout, during which the 
suspect was shot in the belly by a bullet from the state police. 
The man turned out to be heavily armed. In addition, he had 
escaped from the jail of Louvain [Belgium] last April, where he 
still had to serve a sentence of several years, according to ANP. 
  This description corresponds to the events which occurred in 
Hoogstraten on 10 December, at an exit of the E19 Antwerp-Breda 
highway, where the state police shot Otte after having itself 
been shot at. Otte had also thrown a hand grenade. 
  Otte got caught when the state police checked a car which 
turned out to be stolen in Dunkirk. Two of the three passengers 
offered no resistance, but Otte ran away. 
  The arms catch resulted from an investigation into an attack 
on the regional police training school in Amsterdam on 29 
September and into a shootout at Ede [Netherlands], where police 
officers were shot at from a van. 
  During the attack on the police school, a so-called 
fragmentation shell was thrown at the front door; the 3,000 
steel bullets in the shell riddled the door. Two policemen 
remained unhurt, thanks to the steel doorstep which cushioned 
the force of the explosion. 
  The shootout at Ede took place after policemen had attempted 
to halt two stolen vans. The passengers of the vans kicked or 
shot out the vehicle's rear window and opened fire at the 
pursuing police cars. The gangsters managed to escape. Later 
on, a bag with hand grenades and a cap were found by the 
abandoned van. 
  According to the police, most of the suspects, many of whom 
have a criminal record, made partial confessions. According to 
their statements, the attack on the police school was a 
rehearsal for a robbery, which should have yielded millions of 
guilders. What specific target the men had in mind is still 
unknown. 
  Last Saturday, the police were informed of an imminent arms 
transport. They followed the suspect van from northern 
Amsterdam to Zwanenburg (Netherlands), where the arsenal and a 
quantity of drugs were seized. Three individuals, including a 
61-year-old man, were arrested on the spot. The police does not 
rule out the possibility of more arrests.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the Basque </F>
Country autonomous government, at his home in Ajuria Enea, by 
Ana de Benavides; date not given: "Ardanza Claims Gonzalez 
Government Has `Toyed' With Basques"] 
  [Excerpt] From his residence in Ajuria Enea, Jose Antonio 
Ardanza is waiting anxiously to learn the policy of the new 
interior minister, Antoni Asuncion; is saddened by the latest 
ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty Group] attack, which was 
aimed directly at the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]; and is 
irritated at the Spanish Government's failure to move ahead on 
the Guernica Charter. The Basque leader maintains that Felipe 
Gonzalez's policy of making ad hoc coalitions with disparate 
parties is "not intelligent." 
  [de Benavides] As the sergeant major of the Ertzaintza 
[Basque Autonomous Police] lay at death's door, I was asking 
myself: How long will the ETA continue? 
  [Ardanza] Until they decide to change. We have exhausted 
every possible way of reaching out to them. The Ajuria Enea 
accord laid out the framework for a solution, so there is no 
need for further speculation about what ought to be done. How 
long will the ETA continue? Until they decide, once and for all, 
that agreeing to play by the rules of the democratic game does 
not constitute a surrender or humiliation of any kind. 
  [de Benavides] I presume that this latest attack throws into 
question the path of dialogue with the terrorist organization. 
  [Ardanza] If they interpret dialogue as just a way to see 
how 
many more concessions they can extract from their interlocutors, 
then yes, dialogue would be a mistake. Sure, let's have 
dialogue, so long as the goal is to arrive at a definitive 
solution. It is difficult to change ETA's attitudes through 
police action alone, since standing behind ETA are the voters of 
HB [Herri Batasuna]. If we want to convince these people they 
must integrate themselves into the life of democracy, we must 
formulate a solution through dialogue, though admittedly at the 
present moment there is little enthusiasm for further talk. 
  [de Benavides] You were always optimistic about the ETA's 
eventual fate. You even ventured the opinion that the highway 
might solve the problem. 
  [Ardanza] I continue to be optimistic, but I never predicted 
when success would come. We have reached a point in time where 
the ETA is politically a failed option. It may be able to hang 
on to the support it still has in HB, but the rest of society 
completely, unequivocally, and fearlessly rejects it, saying 
"Enough already--we don't need to be `saved'." 
  [de Benavides] But ETA still exists, and keeps on killing. 
  [Ardanza] Neither within the political sector nor in society 
as a whole does the ETA figure among the highest-priority 
issues. The citizenry are not terribly concerned about the ETA 
anymore. They worry more about the economic recession and the 
slowdown in industry. [passage omitted on other topics]

<F P=106> [Interview with Iraqi Ambassador to Turkey Raf i'Dahham </F>
Mujjawil al-Tikriti by Erturk Yondem in the "Behind the Scenes" 
program; date and place not given --recorded, al-Tikriti speaks 
in Arabic with superimposed Turkish translation] 
  [Text] [Yondem] Honorable Ambassador, are you closely 
following the terrorism perpetrated in Turkey by the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan]? How do you describe this form of 
terrorism? 
  [Al-Tikriti] Terrorism is the worst thing in the world and 
we hate terrorism. The aim of terrorism is to hurt people and 
for this reason we strongly condemn terrorism. We, as a state, 
are against all kinds of terrorism because terrorism is an act 
against humanity and religion. We are greatly distressed by the 
situation in which friendly Turkey finds itself. The security 
of Turkey has great importance for us. In my opinion, I think 
terrorist activities are ongoing in northern Iraq and we are 
aware of this. It is definite that there is cooperation between 
Abdullah Ocalan and Jalal Talabani and that their aim is to 
establish a Kurdish state. I would like to point out that our 
people and our government want to cooperate with Turkey on the 
issue of terrorism and we are always ready to cooperate in 
preventing initiatives that aim to divide Turkey. 
  [Yondem] Which countries, do you think, support the PKK? 
What do you know about this issue? 
  [Al-Tikriti] Terrorist activities exacerbated in recent 
years because Apo [Ocalan's nom de guerre] and the Iraqi Kurds 
are trying to achieve their dreams. Apo and Talabani could not 
be so courageous if they had only themselves to depend on. This 
proves the point that foreign forces support these 
organizations, primarily the United States and the Western 
countries. The most important proof of this support are the 
Poised Hammer units in the region. The real help comes from 
those units. The United States and the Western countries are 
implementing their plan very well. On the issue of neighboring 
countries supporting the PKK, I cannot evaluate this issue but I 
can definitely say that the United States and Western countries 
are extending their support. Do you know why PKK terrorism 
exacerbated over the past three years? The reason is that the 
empty territory in northern Iraq is being used for terrorist 
bases since Iraq was struck down. This is the reason why 
attacks on Turkey are being perpetrated from that area. We 
think that we cannot solve this problem without cooperating with 
neighboring countries, especially with Turkey. I want to stress 
a point by using you and the TRT representatives as 
intermediaries, and I am stating as the State of Iraq that we 
have never had and will never have any adverse intentions 
regarding Turkey. The Turks are our brothers and we have great 
affection for Turkey. We want to stress the fact that we can be 
the best fraternal country for Turkey and we want to point out 
that we are ready to do everything for Turkey, not only today 
but tomorrow also. We can never forget Turkey's stand during 
the Gulf War. All of Iraq, especially our Honorable President 
Saddam Husayn, appreciate the recent statements issued by the 
Honorable Ciller and the efforts she exerted to lift the embargo 
imposed on Iraq. There is a need for close cooperation in order 
to eradicate terrorism. If Turkey is ready to cooperate on this 
issue, we are ready to cooperate in all areas.

  [Text] The Istanbul State Security Court has ordered the 
arrest of Gurbetelli Ersoz, the chief editor of OZGUR GUNDEM, 
and of Ali Riza Halis, the director of the newspaper. 
  Eighteen persons working for OZGUR GUNDEM had been taken 
into 
custody a while ago within the framework of the investigation 
being conducted in connection with the terrorist organization 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Today, the 18 were taken from 
the anti-terrorist department to the Istanbul State Security 
Court Prosecutor's Office. After the prosecutor questioned 
them, 14 of the suspects were released. The other four appeared 
before the judge. Of the four, Ersoz and Halis were arrested 
for being members of the PKK. The other two were released.

<F P=106> [Report by Saygi Ozturk: "War Between PKK and TWPLA"] </F>
  [Text] The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has emerged defeated 
from the struggle it waged against the Turkish Workers-Peasants 
Liberation Army [TWPLA] in Tunceli to establish an upper hand 
over that organization. It has been ascertained that the TWPLA 
militants have wounded one of PKK's leading members, Muslim 
Durgun alias Dr. Baran, and captured two PKK commanders. 
  The TWPLA, which is the armed wing of the Turkish Communist 
Party -- Marxist-Leninist Organization [TCP--MLO], adopted a 
decision to move against the PKK after it declared Tunceli the 
"Dersim Province." In an extraordinary party meeting in the 
Mercan valley in the Munzur mountains, the TCP--MLO decided to 
wage a struggle to obstruct the PKK's effort to gain the upper 
hand in Tunceli. Moving in light of that decision, the TWPLA 
strengthened its armed mountain groups. TCP--MLO Secretary 
General Yusuf Kose and TWPLA Commander Hakki Alpan decided that 
PKK's strength in Tunceli must be weakened, TWPLA's militants 
must maintain their training on the Munzur mountains winter and 
summer, and the number of TWPLA's militants must be increased. 
  It has been ascertained that the PKK has failed to achieve 
its objectives in Tunceli and has been forced by the consecutive 
defeats it has suffered to try to reach an agreement with the 
TWPLA. However, the TWPLA has refused to reach an agreement with 
that organization. It has also been ascertained that the TWPLA, 
which has adopted an aggressive stand against the PKK, has 
contacted Armenia and asked to be allowed to establish a camp in 
that republic.

  [Text] Ankara Dec 28 (AFP)--The leader of the separatist 
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, is believed to 
have been murdered in Syria, where he usually lives, the Turkish 
press reported on Tuesday. 
  Interior Minister Nahit Mentese, in a telephone interview 
with state television, said reports that Ocalan might have been 
killed or wounded had reached Ankara, but it had not yet been 
possible to confirm the truth of them. Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller told the press there might be "surprising developments" 
concerning terrorism. 
  There were reports a few weeks ago, which the authorities 
here could not confirm, that Ocalan had been arrested in Syria 
on the orders of President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Turkey has often complained that Syria, and Iran, give help 
to the PKK in its decade-long fight in south-east Turkey for a 
Kurdish state. Since 1984, more than 10,500 civilians, rebels 
and troops have been killed in the fighting.

  [Excerpt] Ankara, Dec 28 (AFP)--[passage omitted] A PKK 
spokesman in Brussels, Kani Yilmaz, dismissed the reports. 
  "Lying reports of this kind make us laugh. We have said 
often enough that our leader is in (Turkish) Kurdistan at the 
head of the struggle," Yilmaz said in a statement to the 
Kurdistan Committee, an agency which represents PKK views. 
  He said Ocalan would probably meet members of the Turkish 
and 
international media at his base in Kurdistan in the near future.

of Kurdistan (ERNK), who represents the interests of the Workers 
Party of Kurdistan (PKK) in Europe, by an unidentified STERN 
correspondent; place and date not given: "I Warn All Europeans"] 
  [Text] [STERN] The PKK was banned in Germany following 
attacks on Turkish consulates and shops. Does it still exist? 
  [Yilmaz] It never officially existed in Germany. Our party 
is the Kurdish families who live here. We work in their houses. 
And this is where this interview is taking place. Who wants to 
prevent that? 
  [STERN] How many followers does the PKK have in Germany? 
  [Yilmaz] About 200,000. 
  [STERN] Do we now have to expect new attacks? 
  [Yilmaz] If our existence is threatened, our people will 
react. 
  [STERN] What does that mean? 
  [Yilmaz] The PKK followers are considered to be "terrorists" 
when they break a few doors. It is not to be considered 
terrorism when our people in Turkish Kurdistan are murdered with 
German weapons. 
  [STERN] Can you explain that? 
  [Yilmaz] Take the massacre in Lice. There, an entire town 
was turned into rubble. These were tanks from Germany. Then 
the Kurds blew off their rage on Turkish institutions in 
Germany. So what? If the breaking of windows is branded as 
"terrorism," then our "terrorism" is "good terrorism." 
  [STERN] Do tourists in Turkey have to be afraid of the PKK? 
  [Yilmaz] Each German mark that a tourist spends in Turkey 
means the death of a person in Kurdistan. Therefore, tourism is 
a very serious target for us. The actions will begin in spring 
with utmost determination. No one should go to Turkey. We 
cannot guarantee the lives of Germans, either. I warn all 
Europeans: Whoever goes to Turkey endangers his or her life.

  [Text] Police were tonight attending a "security alert" at 
Gatwick airport involving an aircraft carrying 176 passengers 
from Athens, according to the airport duty manager. 
  The Excalibur Airways flight, number EXC 5812, landed at 
7:30 
p.m. and is parked on a remote runway while police assess the 
situation, the manager said. 
  Independent Radio News reported that a man on the Airbus A30 
plane claimed to have explosives strapped to his body. 
  The alert was raised by the captain during the flight after 
a 
male passenger had claimed to have a bomb in his briefcase, said 
a spokesman for Excalibur. 
  There were no details of what happened at that stage, he 
said. 
  "But the captain had a look at the man and decided he was a 
low-risk individual. He continued to Gatwick and landed at 8:30 
p.m." 
  The plane was sent to a remote part of the airport where 
danger to installations and other aircraft would be minimised, 
he said. 
  "The plane was then surrounded by police, who are in contact 
with the crew and presumably directly or indirectly with the man 
who claims to have a bomb."

  [Text] Nearly 170 passengers on a holiday jet were caught 
up in an apparent hijack-bid drama tonight when a man on board 
claimed he had a bomb in his briefcase. 
  The Airbus A320 charter plane was on its way from Athens to 
Gatwick Airport when the man warned he had a bomb. 
  A spokesman for the airline, Excalibur -- an independent 
charter company based at East Midlands Airport -- said the 
details of how the man made his threat known were unclear. 
  "There is no longer a threat -- there was no bomb," the 
Excalibur spokesman said. "The passengers are leaving the plane."

  [Text] A bomb exploded in Northern Ireland early today -- 
just minutes after the midnight end of the IRA's Christmas 
ceasefire. 
  The bomb went off in the Co [county] Tyrone village of 
Fintona at 12:16 a.m., said the Royal Ulster Constabulary. 
  A spokesman said there were believed to be casualties after 
the fire brigade sent to the scene called for an ambulance. 
  The target of the bombing was not known but was thought to 
be 
the local police station, which was closed at the time.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Excerpts] The IRA bomb blast only 16 minutes after the end 
of their 72-hour Christmas "cease-fire" shattered hopes today of 
an early end to violence in Ulster. 
  The explosion, condemned by politicians, came as Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd, in an interview conducted before the 
Christmas break, appealed to the IRA to stop prevaricating over 
the British-Irish joint declaration -- and to lay down their 
arms forever. Mr Hurd warned that if the Provisionals refused 
to accept the Downing Street Declaration, then security measures 
would be stepped up against them. You can expect no let-up and 
no quarter on that front," he told them bluntly during the BBC 
Radio 4 Today programme. 
  The blast, within the compound of the police station in the 
remote Co Tyrone village of Fintona, injured a man and a women 
and caused widespread damage to the base and surrounding homes. 
  It came in clear defiance of appeals by the Queen, 
politicians and churchmen for the violence to end, and it 
destroyed the hopes of war-weary Ulster people that the 
"ceasefire" would continue as a truce while the IRA considered 
its response to the declaration. 
  But hopes were not completely dashed either in London or 
Dublin where it was always realised that the IRA high command 
had a tough job on its hands to convince followers of the need 
to end the violence. Nevertheless, there is growing irritation 
in both governments that the Provisionals have given not the 
slightest indication yet that they will cooperate and enable 
Sinn Fein eventually to take part in talks about the future of 
the Province. [passage omitted] 
  The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist 
Party, 
said after the bombing the "IRA killing monster" would not be 
appeased by the declaration. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Kuwait City, Dec 25 (AFP)--The Kuwaiti state 
security court on Saturday postponed indefinitely its verdict in 
the trial of 11 Iraqis and three Kuwaitis accused of plotting to 
kill former U.S. president George Bush during a visit he paid to 
the emirate in April. 
  Presiding judge Salah al-Fahd said the court decided to 
recall the chief prosecution witness, Kuwaiti intelligence 
officer 'Abd-'al Samad al-Shatti, at a session set for February 
5. 
  Al-Shatti would be called on to "clarify the roles of the 
accused," al-Fahd said. 
  The verdict in the trial, which opened on June 5, was 
originally due to be issued on Saturday, having already been 
postponed from the end of October. 
  In June prosecutor general Badr Mas'ad demanded the death 
penalty for all 11 Iraqis and one of the Kuwaitis, and 10-year 
prison terms for the other two Kuwaitis. 
  Of the 14 defendants only two Iraqis -- Ra'd 'Abd-al-Amir 
al-Asadi and Wali 'Abd-al Hadi al-Ghazali -- have acknowledged 
links with the Iraqi intelligence service. 
  Another defendant confessed to having transported explosives 
into Kuwaiti territory, but said he did not know about any plot 
to assassinate Bush. 
  All the rest denied any involvement in the plot or links 
with 
Iraq. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chairman, Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front [JKLF], Mr. 
Amanullah Khan, arrived in Karachi early this morning after 
being released by the Belgian Government. He was received at 
the airport by the Kashmiri leaders and a large number of party 
workers. They chanted slogans in favor of independence of 
Kashmir and condemned the continuing Indian atrocities in 
occupied Kashmir. Mr. Amanullah was arrested in Brussels on 18 
October when he had gone to attend a seminar on Kashmir. 
  Talking to newsmen at the airport, the chairman, JKLF, 
welcomed the secretary-level talks on Kashmir between Pakistan 
and India, which are scheduled to be held in Islamabad on Sunday 
[2 January]. The Kashmiri leader, however, emphasized that the 
Kashmir problem must be resolved in accordance with the wishes 
of the Kashmiri people.

  [Text] New Delhi regretted the rejection of its request by 
the Belgian Government for the extradition of the JKLF [Jammu 
Kashmir Liberation Front] leader, Amanullah Khan, to India. 
Talking to newspersons, the spokesman of the External Affairs 
Ministry said that the government of India had provided 
comprehensive details to the government of Belgium. The case 
was presented in court by the public prosecutor of that country. 
The spokesman observed that the decision is not based on the 
facts of the case but on political and extremist consideration. 
  Replying to another question on the forthcoming 
Indo-Pakistan 
foreign secretary level talks, the spokesman said India has 
adopted a realistic approach and is going for the talks to 
Islamabad with a lot of hopes. He said the government of India 
has noted certain reports appearing in the Pakistani press and 
has preferred to ignore them.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Michel Rosten: "Amanullah Khan and Willy </F>
Claes"] 
  [Text] After 72 days of detention in Brussels, Amanullah 
Khan has returned to Pakistan. [see page 5 of 29 October 
Terrorism Report for arrest reporting] It is amazing that a man 
who had committed no crime in Belgium and who in no way 
threatened the interests of the country could be kept under lock 
and key for so long. The authorities will of course argue that 
the name of the President of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation 
Front (JKLF) is listed with Interpol, and that is reason enough. 
  We will not therefore continue to labor this point. On the 
other hand, it would be wrong of us to close the matter just 
because Mr. Amanullah Khan has been released. Too much doubt 
remains at various levels not to give us cause for concern. 
Thus, firstly from a diplomatic point of view, we should repeat 
once more the conclusions of certain analysts who are convinced 
that the arrest of the JLKF leader in Brussels on 18 October was 
organized at the request of the cabinet of Mr. Willy Claes, keen 
to serve a foreign power -- not to put too fine a point on it, 
the United States -- irritated at seeing the European Parliament 
participate in the Kashmir crisis. In the light of this, it is 
interesting to note that a magazine published in Hong Kong and 
specializing in Asian questions recently carried an in-depth 
article on Washington's particular and recent interest in 
Kashmir. As the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire... 
  On a domestic level, certain points at the Foreign Ministry 
also attract attention. Reliable sources say that Mr. Claes's 
cabinet may have been informed beforehand of the invitation 
issued to Mr. Amanullah Khan by the British socialist group at 
the European Parliament. There is no reason to doubt it, since 
the Belgian foreign minister is president of the European 
socialists: between comrades, it is a fairly logical thing to 
respect the customs required by simple politeness, a point that 
the German and French diplomatic heads for their part found it 
convenient to ignore when, during a recent visit to Warsaw, they 
offered to implement a process of rapprochement between Central 
Europe and the Western European Union. 
  Indeed, Mr. Claes, who had other things on his plate these 
last six months, was perhaps not personally informed of Mr. 
Amanullah Khan's visit before he arrived in Brussels. This is 
what he claims. If he is telling the truth, however, why then 
does he not censure the leader of his cabinet, Mr. Willems, who 
is said to have played a major role in this affair. Moreover, 
if Mr. Claes is as innocent as the proverbial lamb, why is the 
minister so keen to drag his ambassador in Islamabad in the mud 
when his successor, Wilfried Geens, has already been secretly 
appointed? Could not Mr. Staes too have been unaware of the 
plot that was being hatched in the office of one of his 
colleagues -- the consul, in fact. That being said, it is 
nonetheless significant that Mr. Staes, this non-commissioned 
officer, this balding and scruffy individual, accused by the 
minister of having committed "a serious error" will not, it 
appears, pass before a disciplinary committee. He will "only" 
be subject to an administrative inquiry. Informed sources say 
that he will be reprimanded or given a black mark in his file 
before being invited to wander like a suffering soul through the 
corridors of the ministry for the good reason that the minister 
cannot lose face! It all depends on whether you are a prince or 
a pauper...

<F P=106> ["Hz"-signed report: "Alleged `La Belle' Attacker Detained"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Berlin -- The protracted criminal proceedings 
against the suspects of the bombing attack on the Berlin "La 
Belle" discotheque could now come to life again. On Tuesday [4 
January], Berlin's judicial authorities reported that the 
Federal Government has been trying since August 1993 to obtain 
the extradition of a stateless Palestinian arrested in Lebanon, 
who is suspected of having been involved in organizing the 
attack. They said the name of the man is Yusef C. In 1986 he 
was a diplomat at the Libyan mission in East Berlin, the 
so-called People's Bureau. In the course of 1992, he was 
detained in Lebanon pending extradition, a fact the German 
authorities did not know until November 1992. 
  But the German authorities still do not know whether the 
suspect was arrested following an arrest warrant issued by the 
Berlin court in 1990 for jointly committed murder. The Foreign 
Ministry in Bonn, via whom the extradition request was addressed 
to the Lebanese authorities, has not yet received an answer to 
this question. There is no extradition agreement between 
Germany and Lebanon. 
  Two American men and one Turkish woman were killed and 230 
people injured in the bomb attack on the La Belle discotheque on 
7 April 1986. [background passage omitted] 
  The extradition request is not directly linked with the 
suspension of criminal proceedings at the end of April 1993 
against a Palestinian called Imad Mahmud, suspected of having 
been involved in the attack. He was accused of having been 
involved in the planning of the attack, at least at the 
beginning, but not in the organization or even the actual 
carrying out, as Yusef C. allegedly was. The person who planted 
the bomb has still not been found. This part of the proceedings 
could be resumed shortly, since the main prosecution witness, 
Muhammad A., who has meanwhile moved to Norway, was heard by a 
court there. He is said to have confirmed all the main points 
of the statement he had previously made to the Berlin Public 
Prosecutor. 
  According to the findings of the Public Prosecutor -- which 
are contained in the indictment -- in March 1986, during the 
severe political tensions between the United States and Libya 
over the closing of the Gulf of Sirte in the Mediterranean, two 
members of the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin and the accused 
talked about carrying out an attack on American soldiers in 
which as many people as possible should be killed, without 
specifically planning the attack at first.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 6 Jan (NA) -- The Russian Federation 
Embassy in Argentina received anonymous telephone threats toward 
the end of 1993. According to the threats, the embassy was 
going to be blown up with ground-to-air missiles if the internal 
crisis in that country was not resolved. 
  The threats, which were received on 5 October, were only 
revealed today when Alexandre Liapin, the embassy's first 
secretary, and Rafhil Eivazof [names as received], head of the 
consular section, presented charges to Federal Judge Gustavo 
Adolfo Literas, who is now in charge of the investigation. 
  The investigation was initially in the hands of the Federal 
Police, which carried out the pertinent investigation through 
its Foreign Affairs and Worship Department in order to identify 
the threats' perpetrators. 
  The two Russian officials confirmed that the threats were 
received at the embassy, located at 1971 Rodriguez Pena Street 
in this capital. 
  The threats referred to the internal crisis the Russian 
Federation had been experiencing since the takeover of 
Parliament by groups that opposed the government of Boris 
Yeltsin. 
  According to courtroom leaks, the case also was presumably 
evaluated by the Supreme Court in utmost secrecy before the 
courts went into recess for the month of January. 
  The Supreme Court ratified the qualifications of Judge 
Literas, who now will continue the investigation. 
  The court, through then-President Ricardo Levene, had been 
in 
charge of the investigation of the bloody attack on the Israeli 
Embassy on 17 March 1992, but the court could not identify the 
perpetrators of the attack in which more than 20 people died.

<F P=106> [Communique from Inoussa Traore Bouraima, Togolese Minister </F>
of National Defense; in Lome on 6 January; from the "News in 
Brief" program -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Yesterday at exactly 1820, while President 
Gnassingbe Eyadema and Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh were 
holding discussions at the president's private residence in Lome 
District 2, groups of terrorists lying in ambush along the 
boulevard leading to the head of state's private residence 
opened fire at the presidential vehicle, which was on its way to 
the Togolese Inter-Arm Regime [RIT] camp. The vehicle was 
struck by a rocket, in addition to many bursts of gunfire. This 
vehicle -- which fortunately was not carrying the head of state 
-- managed to escape. Soon afterward, more automatic gunfire was 
heard in many places around the capital, mainly around the RIT 
camp, at the Dove of Peace roundabout, on Hydrocarbon Boulevard, 
and on the lower side of the lagoon, near Cinema Togo. In those 
places, the terrorists, who were in plain clothes and driving 
vehicles without any distinctive signs or license plates, shot 
at everything that moved, sowing panic among citizens who were 
mostly returning home from work. Security forces countered 
these attacks immediately. 
  Another group of terrorists in a Nissan Patrol-like vehicle 
were intercepted at the junction of Boulevard Jean-Paul II and 
Akeyi Street, while heading to a private presidential residence 
in Lome District 2, where the head of state and the prime 
minister were holding discussions. The attacks [word 
indistinct] concentrated on the RIT, (Avedougouome), and Rapid 
Intervention Force [FIR] camps. Outside the FIR camp a Toyota 
pickup vehicle was intercepted and its cargo seized. The cargo 
consisted of a sizable amount of arms, including rockets, 
defensive grenades, 7.62-caliber ammunition and propelling 
cartridges [as heard]. A bus carrying attackers was intercepted 
at (Doudogome), and its passengers were arrested and taken to 
the gendarmerie. Another bus, which was following [words 
indistinct] of their attackers was found on the Kara Boulevard 
with only its driver, who was seriously injured. At the Aflao 
customs post, a Peugeot sedan car, which was trying to force its 
way into Ghana, was fired upon -- the driver was killed on the 
spot. The attackers, who were routed around 0330, tried to 
withdraw to the Ghanaian border. Clashes continued until early 
this morning. 
  The provisional toll is as follows: Seven security forces' 
elements, three civilians, and about 30 attackers were killed, 
while 35 terrorists were arrested. 
  Issued in Lome on 6 January 1994. 
  [Signed] The minister of national defense.

  [Text] Davao, Philippines, Dec 29 (AFP) -- Police are 
investigating the disappearance of an American man in this 
southern city but the circumstances of his reported abduction 
are unclear, investigators said Wednesday. 
  Adelaide Mendez, 50, had reported that she and her live-in 
boyfriend Scott Monroe Nelson, 55, from Houston, Texas, were 
walking to a restaurant late Tuesday when two men in a car 
abducted him. 
  Mendez said she believed Nelson was kidnapped on the orders 
of his Filipina wife, Nimfa Pilapil, who was demanding child 
support. 
  But investigators said they were wary of Mendez's account 
because she could not recall exactly where the kidnapping 
occurred, or the color and make of the car used in the abduction. 
  Mendez was being investigated and police released no further 
information on her.

  [Excerpt] Davao, Philippines, Jan 5 (AFP) -- A missing 
American man turned up Wednesday in this southern city eight 
days after he mysteriously vanished, saying he had been 
kidnapped and robbed by gunmen, police said. 
  Scott Monroe Nelson, 55, telephoned a local newspaper from 
the nearby town of Tagum to announce that he had just been freed 
unharmed by unidentified men who snatched him in Davao on 
December 28 and freed him early Wednesday. 
  He later arrived with Tagum police at the regional police 
headquarters in Davao, located about 950 kilometers (600 miles) 
south of Manila, to pay a call on officials who had been stumped 
by his disappearance. 
  The Houston, Texas, native told police that two gunmen 
forced 
him into a car in Davao on December 28 and transported him 
blindfolded outside the city. 
  He said they stripped him of $2,200 in travellers cheques, 
$200 in cash and two gold rings and kept him in a windowless 
room until his release. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Moro rebel leader Nur Misuari yesterday 
denounced the spate of bombings in Davao City and said he will 
not allow saboteurs to disrupt the peace talks between the 
government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) [see 
previous Terrorism Report for initial reports on bombings] 
[passage omitted]. 
  "We ... condemn the dastardly act of bombing sacred places, 
the church and the mosques of Davao City," Misuari said at the 
resumption of government-MNLF talks in Timbangan town. 
  Misuari told Bangsa Moro [Moro Nation] supporters he will 
not 
allow anybody to sabotage the talks. He said the MNLF units in 
Davao City were ready to go after the persons responsible for 
the bombings of the Davao cathedral and mosques. 
  Also attending the affair were Representative Eduardo 
Ermita, 
government peace representatives, and observers from the 
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) of Six led by 
Indonesian Ambassador Yusbar Jamil. 
  The perpetrators of the bombings "... will not succeed, as 
unity and peace in Mindanao will be achieved and will reign," he 
said. [passage omitted on peace talks schedule]

<F P=106> [By Frank Longid Jr. and Nelson Bagaforo] </F>
  [Text] The Philippine National Police (PNP) is offering a 
P500,000 [Philippine pesos] reward for any information that will 
help solve the bombings in Davao City or lead to the arrest of 
the bombers. 
  Director Pantaleon Dumlao, PNP deputy chief for operations, 
said the reward hopefully would encourage reluctant witnesses to 
cooperate fully with the police. 
  The witnesses could even request anonymity, according to PNP 
Director General Umberto Rodriguez. 
  A senior police officer said the reward was put up because 
the PNP still cannot clearly establish which group or groups 
carried out the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City 
and the subsequent explosions at three mosques. 
  The police announced on Wednesday the arrest of two suspects 
in the cathedral attack. 
  Intelligence reports indicated the two suspects, Abdul Munib 
and a man identified only as Jacob, belong to the Abu Sayaf, a 
Muslim extremist group. This has led police to deduce the Abu 
Sayaf is behind the bombing of the cathedral. 
  But the police official said the police are "still looking" 
for more solid evidence against Munib and Jacob. So far, 
investigators are going by intelligence reports which said that 
the two arrived in Davao City from Jolo via Basilan on the last 
week of November along with 23 other Abu Sayaf members. 
  "Even if the Abu Sayaf really is responsible for the attack 
on the cathedral," the source said, "there is still the matter 
of solving the bombing of the mosques." 
  One police official in Davao is certain both the attacks on 
the cathedral and on the mosques were made by only one group. 
  This group, according to Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian, 
police regional director, is out to sow chaos in Mindanao. 
  "There exists a group that is out to create chaos between 
our 
Muslim brothers and Christians. Their targets are religious 
structures," Carian said. 
  During the joint meeting yesterday of the Regional Peace and 
Order Council and the Regional Development Council, Carian said 
the bombers have only one objective: "Open a rift and create 
animosities that will open hostilities between Christians and 
Muslims in Mindanao." 
  Carian and Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte also denied two 
Muslim 
men have been arrested as suspects in the cathedral bombing. 
  "So far, there are no apprehensions made. No one is under 
our custody," Carian said. 
  "We are not in a hurry. We haven't arrested a single 
suspect," Duterte said. 
  It was Senior Inspector Tadgiro Ainin, the Santa Ana police 
chief, who announced the arrest of Munib and Jacob, who was 
positively identified by at least five witnesses. 
  Carian said, "The same criminal groups which initiated these 
bombings in the first place," and a so-called "New Christian 
Democratic Army," which claimed responsibility for the attack on 
the three mosques, was part of this group. 
  "I should not wonder if later on, there will be another 
group 
claiming to be anti-Christian group," he added.

  [Text] Two suspected members of the Abu Sayyaf Group who 
were earlier arrested by police authorities in connection with 
the series of bombings in Davao City are reportedly missing. 
  And to complicate matters, higher police authorities in 
Davao 
denied having arrested the suspects identified as Abdul Munib, 
and Jacob Ibrahim. The extremist Abu Sayyaf Group was held 
responsible for a series of kidnappings and bombings in Mindanao 
last year. 
  Senior Inspector Tranjirol Ainin, Sta. [Santa] Ana Patrol 
Station Commander however, insisted he led a team of more than 
20 operatives which swooped down on Treasure Inn, where Munib 
and Ibrahim were billeted Tuesday night. The inn is just a 
kilometer away from the San Pedro Cathedral. 
  Ainin said Munib had been positively identified by five 
witnesses as one of three armed men who lobbed one of three 
grenades inside the cathedral Sunday night, which killed seven 
persons and injured 150 others. 
  The Sta. Ana police commander said the two were also among 
25 
Tausugs rounded up near the cathedral at about 10 p.m. Tuesday. 
  He said intelligence reports had also tagged Munib and 
Ibrahim as being part of the group which planted a bomb at the 
Fortune Inn in Davao which killed three persons in 1992. 
  Presidential Peace Adviser Oscar Santos warned against 
immediately attributing the spate of Mindanao bombings to 
religious fanaticism, saying this could unwittingly encourage a 
religious war. 
  Santos said: "For the sake of the innocent population of 
Davao, let us move cautiously so as not to ignite further 
violence. We do not know if the bombings are religiously 
motivated." 
  "We may be imputing a Muslim-Christian conflict where there 
is none." 
  Earlier, Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian, regional police 
chief, said a group calling itself the New Christian Democratic 
Army claimed responsibility for the attacks on three Muslim 
mosques allegedly in retaliation to the bombing of the San Pedro 
Cathedral. The claim was made in telephone calls made to 
newspaper offices and radio stations in Davao City, he said. 
  President Ramos hailed leaders of multi-sectoral 
organizations of Davao City for joining hands with government in 
its resolve to put an end to the spate of violence in that city. 
  "The people of Davao City have shown us how the people, 
united and working together, can deal with irrational elements 
out to sow fear and hatred particularly during the holiday 
season," he said.

  [Excerpt] A district court has sentenced a mainland Chinese 
man to nine years in prison and his wife to six for hijacking a 
mainland airliner to Taiwan last September. 
  The Taoyuan District Court meted out the prison terms for 
taxi driver Yang Ming-te and his wife Pan Feng-ying after 
finding them guilty of air piracy. The couple said that they 
would appeal. 
  Judge Chiang Hsiao-pei said that the court showed leniency 
to 
Yang because he surrendered [words indistinct]. His wife 
received the shorter term because she was only an accomplice, 
Qiang added. 
  The couple could have been sentenced to death. 
  The couple armed with a knife and fake explosives brought 
their son along when they hijacked the Russian-built Tupelov 154 
run by the mainland Sichuan Airlines to Taiwan on September 30 
and asked for political asylum. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina yesterday 
accused Muslim separatists of planting a landmine on a railway 
line in retaliation for govemment "accusations" that they had 
torched southern schools last year. 
  Den said he had received reports that two separatist groups 
-- the Pattani United Liberation Organization (Pulo) and the 
Barisan Revolusi Nationale (BRN) -- had earlier met and planned 
the abortive bomb attack. 
  The landmine, a 4 x 15-inch pipe containing dynamite, was 
found and defused at about 10 p.m. on Saturday by army officers. 
It had been placed on the railway track about 500 metres from 
Joh-airong station in Narathiwat. 
  "The two groups had planned to carry out sabotage over the 
New Year holidays to take revenge for authorities' allegations 
that they had torched southern schools," Den said "We later 
found the bomb on the railway tracks, prompting me to believe 
the reports." 
  Den and his New Aspiration Party have several times disputed 
reports by police and the southern army that Muslim separatists 
were responsible for the arson attacks against 35 schools in the 
Muslim-dominated deep South last August. 
  Den's elder brother had been alleged to be former leader of 
a 
Muslim separatist group. New Aspiration is known to want to 
expand its political base in the southernmost provinces. 
  A few suspected arsonists have been arrested over the school 
attacks but deny the charges. They have yet to be prosecuted. 
  Den once said the suspected arsonists were scapegoats. 
  Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Interior Ari Wong-Araya 
said he had instructed the administrative centre for the four 
southern border provinces to be more alert for possible acts of 
terrorism. 
  Ari said the separatists had to stop their terrorism because 
their fellow Muslims could be affected. 
  Also yesterday, 4th Army Region Commander Lt Gen Kitti 
Rattanachaya said the situation in the deep South was under 
control because soldiers had intensified their crackdown on the 
separatists. 
  "There should be nothing to worry about," Kitti told 
reporters in Bangkok. 
  "Soldiers and police can handle (the situation) and we are 
launching operations to root out the separatists." 
  He said the intensified crackdown was working because more 
separatists had been pressured into surrendering. 
  The southern army chief said there were very few people 
still 
supporting or sympathizing with the Muslim terrorists.

  [Text] Zagreb, Jan 6 (AFP) -- Four Canadian peacekeepers 
were disarmed and held for several hours by Croatian soldiers 
who threatened the UN troops with their weapons, the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) announced Thursday. 
  General Jean Cot, the French soldier who commands UNPROFOR 
in 
the former Yugoslavia, described the incident Wednesday [5 
January] as "outrageous" and demanded that the Croatian soldiers 
be punished. 
  The Canadian troops had obtained a routine authorisation to 
cross Croatian lines in the Medak enclave in the south of the 
country. 
  Seven Croatian army soldiers approached them and ordered 
them 
to lay down their weapons before the Canadian soldiers were led 
away at gunpoint. 
  UNPROFOR said the four were released after negotiations with 
a local Croatian commander. 
  Canada has 560 troops in the region based at Gracac. They 
were deployed in the Medak area after Croatian troops attacked 
Serb villages, massacring dozens of people.

<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Charges leveled by a guerrilla from Arauca on the 
"24 Hours" newscast have confirmed that there is clandestine 
arms trafficking by the Venezuelan Guard to guerrillas of the 
ELN [Army of National Liberation] and the FARC [Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia] in the border area. On 5 January, the 
commander of the Army confirmed this information and said he had 
already given the Venezuelan authorities a list of names of 
Venezuelan soldiers involved in this illegal arms trade. 
  [Begin Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman recording, 
identified by caption] The operation we carried out and the 
statements of a guerrilla member produced information that was 
turned over to the Prosecutor's Office. If you want names, I can 
tell you that I cannot reveal them because this case is now the 
responsibility of the Venezuelan authorities. [end recording] 
  The "24 Hours" newscast, however, learned that the following 
Venezuelan soldiers are involved: Colonel Montes, Guard 
Escalante, and Inspectors Ramos and Nunez. We also learned that 
the Venezuelan Government is investigating certain reports that 
many Venezuelan soldiers and guards offer protection to 
Colombian guerrillas. Gen. Guzman also confirmed that there are 
constant exchanges between Venezuelan subversives and Colombia's 
ELN. 
  [Begin Guzman recording] We know that certain guerrillas, 
especially those in the ELN, have crossed the border to give 
training on the Venezuelan side. [end recording] 
  The Army commander added that although it is impossible to 
control the 2,219 km borderline, the necessary measures were 
implemented in coordination with the Venezuelan Army.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday stated 
that in a letter sent to the U.S. Embassy, the Bolivian 
Government made it clear that it acts and will act in keeping 
with its domestic legislation. It further stated that it 
condemns any interference in matters that come under its sole 
jurisdiction. 
  The foreign minister made this public after reporting that 
he 
had received a letter from the U.S. Embassy, bearing seal number 
466, in which the U.S. Government expressed its disagreement 
with the alleged granting of a pardon to a person implicated in 
terrorist crimes. 
  Aranibar stated that it is incumbent upon the Bolivian 
Government, to the exclusion of everybody else, to grant or not 
to grant a pardon to persons involved in some crimes, and that 
all the different levels of the judiciary abide by the country's 
legislation. 
  The foreign minister further stated that last 29 November he 
had received a verbal note from the U.S. Embassy, in which it 
voiced its opinion about the alleged granting of a pardon to a 
Bolivian citizen, Marcelo Oliva, who was implicated in an attack 
on the U.S. Marines' residence. 
  "We answered them through another verbal note, as 
appropriate, stressing that that was a matter that comes under 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bolivian Government," he 
explained. 
  He thus indicated that the different levels of the judiciary 
will respect the country's rules and legislation, which 
establish with striking clarity the independence of the three 
branches of government and the duties of each of them. 
  According to the foreign minister's statement, the long and 
the short of it is that the Foreign Ministry has made it clear 
that "the Bolivian Government acts and will act pursuant to the 
country's legislation." He went on to say that the Bolivian 
Government likewise condemns any interference in matters that 
come under its sovereign decision. 
  With regard to the "not too friendly" tone of the letter 
issued by the U.S. Embassy, Aranibar said that the response the 
Foreign Ministry gave to it was couched "in the tone, terms, and 
firmness that was suitable to the occasion." 
  In its letter the U.S. Embassy states that "the 
traditionally 
excellent relations existing between our countries may be 
adversely affected if a pardon is granted to terrorists or if 
any other measure is taken to release them." 
  To this effect, it points out that "the United States will 
hold responsible any individual who, directly or indirectly, 
supports terrorist actions against U.S. citizens or U.S. 
interests." 
  The letter openly accuses the Pro-Amnistia group for its 
activities toward obtaining a pardon for citizens who have been 
taken into custody on terrorist charges. It even threatens with 
applying all sorts of retaliatory measures if a pardon is indeed 
granted to these people.

  [Text] The Attorney General's Office announced tonight [4 
January] that on 31 December in Ocosingo, approximately 200 
heavily armed members of the group that has risen up in arms 
attacked Mexican Petroleum's [Pemex] RSS-6 exploration brigade, 
from whom they stole 1,566 kg of dynamite, 10,440 detonators, 
and the truck used to transport the explosives. The Attorney 
General's Office says there is evidence the explosives may have 
been used to destroy bridges in La Virgen and La Florida, 15 and 
13 km from Ocosingo respectively.

  [Editorial Report] The following are reports on insurgent 
activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian papers monitored 
between 17 and 19 December. 
  A group of 12 Shining Path "terrorists" stormed a bank in 
Lima and opened fire at point blank range against the seven 
employees and some 12 clients who were there, killing five 
people. A "terrorist" identified as Teodora Huamani Ramos also 
died during the incident. The "terrorists" escaped after 
scattering leaflets and planting two bombs on Riva Aguero 
Avenue, and one on Tranquilino Velarde Street. Another two 
groups of "terrorists" keeping watch outside the bank 
machine-gunned a police pickup truck that went past the bank, 
killing two plainclothesmen. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 17 
Dec 93 p A18) 
  On 16 December a group of approximately 60 Shining Path 
"terrorists" invaded the township of Chingal, in Sihuas 
Province, 270 km north of the city of Huaraz, burning public 
buildings and threatening to kill local authorities if they did 
not resign their posts within 15 days. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 
18 Dec 93 p A17) 
  On 14 December a group of nearly 60 Shining Path 
"terrorists" 
invaded Quinches District, in Sihuas Province, 310 km southeast 
of the city of Huaraz, where they first threatened to kill the 
local mayor and then later hung him from a tree in the Plaza de 
Armas. The "terrorists" stole money, food, animals, and 
medicines during the two days they stayed in the township.

<F P=106> [Interview with Peruvian Army Colonel Jose Bailetti, </F>
retired, president of the Institute for National Defense 
Research, Iniden, by Victor Andres Ponce; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Ponce] How do you interpret the latest actions of 
the Shining Path [SL]? 
  [Bailetti] If one considers the letters of [SL leader 
Abimael] Guzman -- which almost admit surrender -- and reviews 
the last letter, signed by Abimael and four [SL] Central 
Committee members, one can see that the terrorist group is 
obviously breaking into factions. Since this organization began 
its bloody war, the appearance of a dissident group represents 
an unprecedented move... 
  [Ponce] Who would be heading this dissident group? 
  [Bailetti] It could be that this group would be headed by 
Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand (Feliciano) ["Comrade Feliciano"]... 
  [Ponce] Are there any clues in this regard? 
  [Bailetti] Police work will confirm this possibility. 
  [Ponce] Do the actions by the SL in Lima follow the 
activities of the four zonal committees? 
  [Bailetti] This is true. Following the capture of the SL top 
leaders, the terrorist group established four zonal committees 
in each one of Lima's cones [conos]. The SL actions in Ancash 
Department are also significant. Its December actions confirm 
this. Another group continues to be active in Satipo Province in 
the Ene Valley zone... 
  [Ponce] Are there any differences between the latest SL 
actions and those commanded by Guzman? 
  [Bailetti] The main difference is that today's SL people 
have 
diminished economic resources because they are no longer 
financed by drug traffickers. The Huallaga committee has been 
acting on its own for a long time. The Huallaga committee and 
the traffickers are currently moving toward the south of our 
country on the Aguaytia-Ene Valley axis. 
  [Ponce] From the way you describe the situation, Guzman has 
not been heeded by the majority of the militants who are free? 
  [Bailetti] This is not necessarily true. Some 180 SL 
militants killed three SL leaders and then surrendered under the 
Repentance Law in the Sello de Oro zone in Ayacucho Department. 
  [Ponce] What is your prognosis for the future of the SL? 
  [Bailetti] I believe it will break into three factions: The 
Huallaga militants, who are moving to the south as drug 
traffickers also move in that direction; those who will continue 
with their armed actions; and, finally, those who will obey 
Guzman's call. 
  [Ponce] So, what is the balance of the negotiations between 
the government and Guzman? 
  [Bailetti] There is no room for any negotiation here. We are 
facing a decimated, cornered, and penniless force. There is 
nothing to compare the situation that once prevailed in Colombia 
or El Salvador where negotiations were a national necessity.

<F P=106> [Report by Cesar Lengua and Jorge Rojas from the "Good </F>
Morning, Peru" Newscast -- live] 
  [Text] A series of bomb attacks damaged four bank branches 
and left 13 people injured last night. Three of the bank 
branches are located in La Victoria, near Gamarra, and the other 
is located is the San Juan de Miraflores District. 
  Terrorist criminals simultaneously detonated explosives 
devices at the bank branches last night at 2210. The branches 
are located in various points of the capital, and the explosions 
caused considerable damage. 
  Three bank offices were damaged by blasts in La Victoria 
District. A Credit Bank branch located at the intersection of 
Aviation and Uname Avenues sustained considerable structural 
damage. A few meters away, the explosion of a powerful device at 
the Wiese Bank, which is located at the intersection of Uname 
and Gamara Avenues, not only caused considerable damage but also 
left 13 people injured. Many of those injured sustained cuts 
and bruises. The injured, who were mainly pedestrians, were 
taken to the 2 de Mayo Hospital, where they are now recovering 
from their injuries. 
  The detonation also caused additional damage by breaking 
windows in buildings and shopping malls located in the vicinity. 
Work teams removed the damaged windows during the early morning 
hours. A Continental Bank branch, located near the Wiese Bank, 
also sustained considerable damage. 
  The same thing happened in the San Juan de Miraflores 
District. In this area, precisely at Vargas Machuca Avenue and a 
few meters away from a military facility, a Credit Bank branch 
also sustained damage after terrorists detonated explosive 
devices. The damage here was minor.

  [Text] Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila did not deny 
the existence of a small terrorist group in the country. He 
also announced the arrest of four alleged rebels accused of 
carrying out the attacks at the Lima Mayor's Office and the Air 
Force installations. 
  [Begin recording] [Briones] No, we cannot discount the 
possibility of another small group and -- I repeat -- a small 
group. We do recommend that they take the appropriate measures, 
because the terrorism law is very strict. I would not like 
anyone to claim later that we acted too drastically with them. 
At this time I think we should say -- and I would like to end 
with this -- that we will continue our counterterrorism 
operations. We want to finish this once and for all, arrest all 
those involved in the recent terrorist actions, and punish them 
with the full force of the law. We will keep working until we 
attain complete peace in the country. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Are any suspects under arrest? 
  [Briones] At this time we are still investigating. There 
have been a few arrests. 
  [Reporter] How many? 
  [Briones] We now have about four people in custody. They are 
important people within their organizations. We continue to 
investigate, and we expect to see some results soon. 
  [Reporter] Are these people members of Shining Path or the 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement? 
  [Briones] The people we have arrested are members of Shining 
Path. [end recording]

  [Text] Lima, 6 Jan (EFE) -- A cart used by street workers 
in Lima exploded today in front of a store located in the 
capital's downtown area. The explosion injured nine persons and 
caused considerable damage. The store's windows shattered into 
fragments injuring various persons, including two children. 
According to witnesses, the cart was left by two men and a 
woman shortly before the explosion. 
  A branch of the same store located in Lima's Miraflores 
District was attacked with a car bomb last November, shortly 
after one of its owners was released by the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Four Chileans affiliated with 
the MRTA were arrested on that occasion. They will be 
sentenced, probably to life, today or tomorrow, it was reported 
on Tuesday by Daniel Espichan, special prosecutor for cases of 
terrorism. 
  Today's attack follows the detonation of three car bombs 
that 
were placed in Lima beginning 28 December and which resulted in 
one death, 40 injured persons, and the destruction of numerous 
stores and houses. The National Police attributed these and 
other attacks to the Maoist Shining Path band.

  [Text] Montevideo, 31 Dec (EFE) -- A medium-sized bomb 
exploded today in Montevideo at the home of Prosecutor Jose Luis 
Barbagelata who in November, 1993, requested that General Ivan 
Paules, retired former chief of the Information Services of the 
Uruguayan military regime, be brought to trial. 
  The explosion, which occurred early this morning at the 
garage door of Barbagelata's home, located in a residential 
district of Montevideo, caused fairly serious damage to the 
house and neighboring buildings, but no one was injured. 
  A commando called the Guard of Artigas, which presumably 
groups retired military men and officers on active duty who have 
ultra-rightist leanings and who are linked to the old de facto 
regime (1971-1984), claimed responsibility for the attack in a 
call to EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO newspaper, and justified its 
action with its repudiation of "the corrupt judicial system." 
  After the attack, police found a Guard of Artigas pamphlet 
that contains harsh criticism of recent sentences that have been 
handed down by the Judicial Branch. 
  Paules, who was also president of the Military Circle, has 
been sentenced to eight months in prison. The sentence, which 
was confirmed by two judicial instances, was handed down for the 
crime of "disrespect for the president," due to his harsh 
criticism of President Luis Alberto Lacalle on 21 October.

  [Text] Official sources have told this daily that President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle and Interior Minister Raul Iturria 
evaluated yesterday all aspects related to the attack on the 
house of prosecutor Jose Luis Barbagelata. They agreed that it 
was an action motivated by "a desire to create a political 
event." 
  President Lacalle reiterated to the interior minister "his 
total support" in "getting to the bottom" of the matter within 
the framework of the investigations being carried out to find 
those responsible for the attack, which was labeled "a political 
issue." 
  The Artigas Guard claimed responsibility for the attack. 
This is a clandestine group whose members identify themselves 
as the intermediate commands of the Army. This group also 
claimed responsibility for the attack against the studio of 
former President Julio Sanguinetti in mid-1992, in addition to 
other actions. 
  Military sources told this daily that the Army is continuing 
the investigation ordered by Army Commander Daniel Garcia when 
the clandestine organization released the so-called Bulletin No. 
2. 
  A military source said: "No conclusion has been reached, and 
therefore nothing certain can be said. The Artigas Guard is 
being investigated, including its possible connections with the 
Army if it has any, because its members call themselves the 
intermediate commands." Military and government sources 
indicated that "there is no evidence" to presume they are indeed 
military personnel. 
  One of the sources said: "They call themselves intermediate 
commands, but this has not been verified. It has also not been 
verified what their composition is: whether they be civilian, 
civilian and military, or military alone." 
  Army Commander General Daniel Garcia told this newspaper on 
7 
October 1993 that "the people responsible for the attack have 
not yet been identified, but when this happens it will be known 
because there will be a very big noise. Working in silence does 
not mean we are not working." 
  He added: "The day we find the members of the so-called 
Artigas Guard, or anyone responsible for any other irregular 
event, we will react vigorously within the current legal 
regulations." 
  The official sources noted that the investigation of this 
case is being carried out by the Security and Investigation 
Directorate of the Police Information and Intelligence National 
Directorate and by the Technical Police National Directorate, in 
cooperation with the Defense Information Service of the Defense 
Ministry.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Nabi 'Abd-al-Sattar] </F>
  [Text] Muhammad Fa'iz Jibril, representative of the 
National Front for the Salvation of Libya in Cairo, has 
disclosed serious details about the position of the Libyan 
opposition elements in Egypt before and after the normalization 
of Egyptian-Libyan relations. In exclusive statements to 
AL-WAFD, Jibril affirmed that following the restoration of ties 
between Egypt and Libya, Libyan President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi 
pledged not to touch his opponents in Cairo. 
  Jibril noted that the Egyptian authorities had relaxed 
protection measures around Libyan opposition elements residing 
in Egypt upon the normalization of relations with Libya in view 
of al-Qadhdhafi's pledge. He pointed out that Egypt and other 
Arab and European states have rejected the Libyan authorities' 
request to hand over the opponents of al-Qadhdhafi's regime. 
  Jibril noted that he has received many death threats 
involving him and other figures of the Libyan opposition and 
their families. He said that al-Qadhdhafi's regime has been 
involved in 23 attacks against Libyan opposition elements in 
European capitals. 
  He estimated the number of political prisoners in Libya at 
3,000 and affirmed that the Libyan opposition is closely 
monitoring developments in the case of the disappearance of 
[former Libyan foreign minister] Mansur al-Kikhya through daily 
contacts with the Egyptian authorities.

<F P=106> [Column by Hasan Cemal: "As the Hizballah in Iraq Appears </F>
on the Scene"] 
  [Excerpt] An Islamic organization has surfaced in northern 
Iraq to carry out armed activities in that part of the country. 
It has identified itself as the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan 
[Kurdistan Islamci Hareketi, IMK]... 
  The IMK militants attacked the supporters of the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan, which is headed by Jalal Talabani. The 
attacks took place last Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday. The 
militants also clashed with the supporters of Mas'ud Barzani, 
leader of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan. The incidents were 
in Raniyah, Kifri, and Kujah... 
  The Hizballah in Iraq has established itself in Kuldazah and 
Raniyah, which are close to Iran's border. That organization is 
not represented in the Federal Assembly of Kurdistan, which is 
based in Irbil, because it only secured 5.1 percent of the votes 
in the elections in 1992. Seven percent of the vote was needed 
for representation. 
<H5>  Iran's Support </H5>
  The Hizballah organization in Iraq is mainly supported by 
Tehran... It has received aid from Iran in the form of cash, 
arms, and provisions, particularly since 1991. That is common 
knowledge. According to Ahmad Bamarni, who is a close associate 
of Jalal Talabani, the Hizballah organization is also supported 
by Saudi Arabia and even by Afghanistan. That organization's 
ideology is based on Imam Khomeyni's teachings. Naturally, that 
provides for Tehran's support. Nevertheless, the Hizballah 
members have not renounced their religious sect. They are the 
followers of the Sunni sect. Of course, that accounts for Saudi 
Arabia's support. 
  The recent weakening of the economy in northern Iraq has had 
a significant bearing on the strengthening of the Hizballah 
organization. The gradual worsening of poverty has disappointed 
the people in the region. Consequently, that state of affairs 
has nourished Islamic radicalism, as has been the case among the 
Palestinian people and in Algeria. Obviously, Islamic 
radicalism has strengthened as a result of poverty and the 
central administration's failures. 
<H5>  Beards and Islamic Dress </H5>
  We met Ahmad Bamarni a few days ago. Referring to the 
Hizballah organization, he said: "We have a university in 
Irbil. It provides education for 5,000 students. We have 
colleges for agricultural and medical studies in Dahuk. We also 
have an institute for veterinary studies and a medical college 
in al-Sulaymaniyah. Students from many families do not attend 
them because they are poor. However, the IMK gives them an 
opportunity to study, provided that the male students wear a 
beard and female students wear Islamic dress. In fact, the 
number of young people who join this organization is gradually 
increasing." 
  Yes, the Hizballah organization employs several tactics to 
strengthen itself. Meanwhile, it also helps many people to have 
their own shops or establish their own businesses. I have 
observed the poverty in northern Iraq. In view of that, I am 
aware of what can be achieved even through small amounts of 
material aid. 
<H5>  What Does Tehran Fear? </H5>
  What does Tehran, which supports the Hizballah organization, 
wish to achieve in northern Iraq? Bamerni replied as follows: 
  The Hizballah organization is playing Iran's game. Tehran 
wishes to create instability in northern Iraq. Iran's military 
aircraft repeatedly bombed the northern Iraq border area some 
time ago. That country closed its border about three weeks ago. 
It closed down the border gates that give access to 
al-Sulaymaniyah, Hajj 'Umran, and Irbil. What worries Tehran is 
this: A democratic, pluralistic, and secular system is being 
established in northern Iraq for the first time. Political 
parties exist in Irbil and other large cities. There are 
newspapers, magazines, and radio networks. The people are 
expressing their opinion. The people also appear on television. 
The modernization process has made Tehran feel very uneasy. 
Iran's officials fear that the Kurds in Iran and the rest of 
Iraq may decide to adopt a similar model. They believe that 
that would be an unfavorable example for their country.

  [Text] The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces [APF] held a 
press conference at noon today at al-Khalisah Compound of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command at 
al-Yarmuk Camp south of Damascus. The APF released a statement 
detailing the alliance's political goals and structure. 
Following is the statement's full text: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The key 
goals of the APF: The political goals: Proceeding from the 
necessity to keep the struggle going in order to topple the 
Gaza-Jericho accord and realize our people's and the Arab and 
Islamic nation's objectives, the alliance obligates itself to 
the following: 
  First, on the Palestinian front: 
  1. The Palestinian National Charter. 
  2. Our people's inalienable rights to their homeland, 
Palestine, liberation, return, self-determination, and full 
national independence. 
  3. The Palestinian issue is an Arab and Islamic one. The 
responsibility for the deliverance of Palestine must be borne by 
the Arab and Islamic nation, most of all the Palestinian people. 
  4. Our people's and territory's unity and that of their 
cause and objectives and their national destiny and adherence to 
all their national and historic rights. No one has the right to 
cede any part of these rights. 
  5. Adherence to the option of armed struggle and jihad as a 
principal tool to attain liberation. 
  6. Adherence to the unity of the Palestinian people inside 
and outside the occupied homeland as well as the integrity of 
their land. 
  7. The alliance deems the PLO a national achievement whose 
gains must be safeguarded and institutions rebuilt on democratic 
foundations. 
  8. The alliance deems the present PLO leadership 
unrepresentative of the Palestinian people or their hopes and 
aspirations. 
  9. The alliance deems the recognition document and the 
'Arafat-Rabin agreement national treason that all possible means 
must be used to topple. Neither the document nor the agreement 
are binding on the Palestinian people. 
  10. Adherence to Palestine as a historic homeland that has 
no alternative for the Palestinian people, and resistance to all 
projects of a substitute homeland or resettlement, transfer, 
compensation, or attempts to suppress the Palestinian people's 
national identity. 
  11. Boycotting the political, administrative institutions 
responsible for implementing the self-administration and the 
Gaza-Jericho accord and the holding of elections for the 
self-administration council, and organizing the widest possible 
popular campaign to isolate, ostracize, and topple these 
institutions. 
  12. Severing links with all the institutions that 'Arafat or 
his team lead or are involved in under the name of the PLO. 
  13. A determination to pursue and step up armed struggle and 
all forms of political and mass struggle, particularly inside 
the occupied territory to keep the popular intifadah going as 
the main arena of conflict with the Zionist enemy to promote the 
inalienable, historic and national rights of the Palestinian 
people. 
  Second, on the Arab and Islamic fronts: 
  1. A reaffirmation that the Palestinian cause is the core of 
the Arab-Zionist conflict. 
  2. Taking into consideration that the dangers attendant to 
the 'Arafat-Rabin accord are not limited to the Palestinian 
people and Palestine but constitute a threat to the Arab and 
Islamic nation, the APF would like to make it clear that facing 
this liquidatory conspiracy and its repercussions is a 
responsibility for the Palestinian people and Arab and Muslim 
masses. 
  3. A bolstering of joint Palestinian-Arab-Muslim militant 
ties to counter Zionist and expansionist hegemonic blueprints 
and political, cultural, and economic normalization. 
  4. A reaffirmation of the right of the Palelstinian people 
in the diaspora to exercise their militant responsibilities 
alongside the nationalist, Islamic, and Arab forces to promote 
liberation, return, self-determination, and full national 
independence. 
  Third, on the global front: 
  1. The role being played by the United States supporting the 
Zionist entity and advocating its plans against our Palestinian 
people and their struggle and the Arab liberation movement is 
deemed by the alliance a brazen aggression on our people and our 
national cause. 
  2. The APF underscores the importance of stepping up 
cooperation with the Islamic, Asian, and African states, as well 
as with all the friendly nations standing by the struggle of our 
Palestinian people and supporting their inalienable national 
rights. 
  3. We stress the importance of forging an alliance with all 
the forces for liberation and progress around the world -- the 
forces that reject imperialist domination and Zionist invasion 
and support our struggle and our national rights. 
  4. To work to disseminate all that relates to the 
Palestinian cause and the national struggle to win the widest 
possible public opinion over to the cause of our struggle and 
our rights and to make the case that the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement 
neither amounts to a solution nor brings peace. 
  The alliance's structure: 
  Inspired by its political goals, the APF is to form a 
Central 
Command, which will be responsible for formulating its 
decisions, policies, and political goals: 
  A -- The numerical composition: Each faction will have two 
representatives on the APF's Central Command. 
  B -- The meetings: The Central Command is to convene 
sessions at least once a month. This is in addition to 
extraordinary meetings that may be convened at the request of at 
least four factions. Decisions are to be adopted by agreement 
[bittawafuq], and the meetings are to be chaired on a rotating 
basis. 
  C -- A Secretariat is to be set up for the APF and each 
faction will have one representative there. It will convene at 
least once a week, or whenever the need arises. Its task will 
be to follow and see to the implementation of the Central 
Command's resolutions. The Secretariat will have permanent 
headquarters. 
  [Signed] The APF: The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas; 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command; the Palestinian National Resistance Movement, Fatah; 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine; the Popular 
Liberation War Vanguards--al-Sa'iqah Forces; the Palestinian 
Struggle Front; the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine; the 
Revolutionary Palestinian Communist Party; and the Palestine 
Liberation Front.

  [Excerpt] Algiers, Jan 6 (AFP)--Algerian security officials 
have identified the man behind last month's massacre of 12 
Croats at Tamezguida south of the Algerian capital as Sayeh 
Attia, the EL WATAN daily reported Thursday [6 January] [see 
page 20 of 21 December 93 Terrorism Report]. 
  Security forces have arrested Attia's father-in-law, named 
only as Bouchakor in the report, charging him with sheltering 
the armed gang after the December 15 killings, and have 
recovered stolen goods. 
  Attia was reported to have led an armed band for more than a 
year and to be responsible for more than 200 attacks. He has 
been implicated in an assault on the Boughezoul barracks, 150 
kilometres (90 miles) south of here, which left 19 soldiers 
dead, EL WATAN said. [background passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, in Denmark, by Muhammad </F>
Salah-al-Din, in Cairo] 
  [Text] The spokesman for the Egyptian al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group], Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, commonly known 
as "Abu-Talal al-Qasimi," has said in a telephone interview from 
Copenhagen with AL-HAYAH, that al-Jama'ah has not prepared 
assassination lists, and that its "legal committee" had 
undertaken "the issuing of legal decisions for killing in 
certain cases." 
  He confirmed al-Jama'ah's responsibility in the 
assassination 
of the former speaker of the Egyptian Parliament, Dr. Rif'at 
al-Mahjub, emphasizing [al-Jama'ah's] rejection of 
reconciliation with the Egyptian Government. He explained that 
the military court's death sentence against him had made it easy 
for him to obtain political asylum in Denmark as "politically 
persecuted." He denied that al-Jama'ah received any support from 
foreign powers, asserting that it had differences with Iran. 
  He said that Washington knows that Shaykh 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman is innocent of the charge of which he is accused, 
and said that if he were turned over to Egypt, "it would be a 
great mistake" on the part of the American authorities. 
  The text of the interview follows. 
  [Salah-al-Din] How did you leave Egypt? How did you get 
political asylum in Denmark? 
  [Qasim] I was a member of al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and was 
arrested in September 1981 on the heels of the precautionary 
decisions issued by al-Sadat. He was assassinated, and then came 
the incidents in Asyut during my incarceration. Even so, I was 
surprised to find my name on the list of those accused. I was 
sentenced to prison for six years and served it. Just three days 
after I left prison, I was arrested again and served several 
months, until God willed that I should escape from prison, and 
from the country, too. I went to Pakistan, where I published 
AL-MURABITUN magazine in Peshawar and continued to run it, and 
propagate the faith. Then I learned that the ambassador of one 
of the Gulf states was pressuring the Pakistani Government to 
turn me over to Egypt because the magazine had published an 
article against his country. At that time I had an invitation to 
visit Denmark and cooperate with some other brothers. I left 
Pakistan and headed for Copenhagen. After arriving here, I 
learned that my name had appeared among those of the accused in 
Case No. 392 (Supreme State Security), known by the name 
"Returnees from Afghanistan." I was sentenced to death along 
with seven others. Amnesty International published a report 
confirming that I was being persecuted politically and that the 
death sentence had been passed on me despite the fact that I had 
been outside Egypt for several years. I had applied for 
political asylum in Denmark, and the death sentence and Amnesty 
International report came along to speed up the approval of my 
application. 
  [Salah-al-Din] How do you pursue political action despite 
the 
fact that political asylum rules forbid it? 
  [Qasim] There are no such laws here in Denmark. I am 
permitted to pursue any political action, to act, to send and 
receive letters. In any case, I am bringing no harm to the 
country in which I am living, nor am I breaking its laws. 
  [Salah-al-Din] When did you become the spokesman of 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah? Is this the post that was held by Dr. 
'Ala' Muhi-al-Din, who was killed in September 1990? 
  [Qasim] The area of organizational and movement issues is 
not 
open for discussion. I know that Egyptian intelligence knows 
little about the Islamic movement and its members and is 
stumbling in its dealing with us. We like it that way--it makes 
our work easy. We want to leave them to their confusion. 
  [Salah-al-Din] How do you perform your mission? Is it enough 
to read what the newspapers publish and the wire services carry, 
or are there contacts between you and the leaders of al-Jama'ah 
inside and outside Egypt? 
  [Qasim] These too are organizational matters relating to 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, and I am not in a position to discuss 
them. 
  [Salah-al-Din] The U.S. Government has accused Dr. 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman in the bombing case, yet al-Jama'ah has announced 
no position on this development. Why? 
  [Qasim] No comment. We in al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah have 
already issued a statement in which we warned against 
extraditing Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman to Egypt, on the grounds that he 
had been detained without any specific charge. Now the situation 
is different. They have not turned him over, and there is a 
charge against him, thus we have no comment. 
  [Salah al-Din] But al-Jama'ah generally does comment on 
events and issues of even less importance--how can it not have a 
specific position after the arrest of its leader? 
  [Qasim] We have our own reasons, and we leave it to others 
to 
find their schemes. We expect our lack of comment to carry 
meaning, but what I would like to say is that we still hold our 
view on the matter of extradition to Egypt. We are saying that 
if the U.S. Government extradites Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman to Egypt, 
it will have made a great mistake, and a needless one. Because 
they have gone this far with their trickery and fabricated a 
charge against him, they know better than anyone that he is 
innocent, and in this case we will not comment--with words. 
  [Salah-al-Din] What is your comment on reports that Dr. 
'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman was a CIA agent, and that he was actually 
involved in the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York? 
  [Qasim] That is a lie and slander that merits no response 
whatsoever. We have declared that al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and 
its leader had no part in the bombing case in America. We are 
positive that the first to be aware of Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman's 
innocence was the U.S. Government itself. 
  [Salah-al-Din] One of the charges against 'Abd-al-Rahman is 
that he took a sum of money collected from Muslims in the United 
States for the Afghan mujahidin, and that this was the cause of 
his dispute with Mustafa Shalabi. That 'Abd-al-Rahman was behind 
Shalabi's murder. 
  [Qasim] That is laughable. It has no leg to stand on, not 
even a lame one. First of all: Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman went recently 
to America when the Afghan issue was barely settled, and before 
that he was virtually under house arrest for two years. 
Secondly: Shalabi was the director of al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah's 
U.S. office. The charge that the leader of al-Jama'ah was behind 
his murder is an invalid charge, because, anyway, a Muslim would 
not dare kill another Muslim or encourage others to do so. 
Third: we believe that the aim of spreading these rumors is to 
draw attention away from the real killers who brutally killed 
Mustafa Shalabi. 
  [Salah-al-Din] And who was that? 
  [Qasim] We believe it was the Mosad (Israeli intelligence). 
There was a close relationship between al-Sayyid Nusayr, who 
killed [Meir] Kahane, and Mustafa Shalabi. We know that the 
Mosad had information confirming that Shalabi was the planner of 
Kahane's assassination. 
  [Salah-al-Din] Does that mean that there were no disputes 
between 'Abd-al-Rahman and Shalabi? 
  [Qasim] There were no basic differences that would lead to 
such an act. The differences were in their points of view as 
regarded administrating their work. 
  [Salah-al-Din] What is al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah? Who are its 
members? What is the difference between it and the Islamic Jihad 
and al-Shawqiyun and al-Najun min al-Nar and others? 
  [Qasim] There is a confusion of false stories about the 
founding of al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and its evolution. I am 
talking about al-Jama'ah and private affairs I have seen, of 
which I was personally aware, not in a secondhand fashion. 
Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah's activities started in Egyptian 
universities in the mid-1970s. In 1978, the idea came along to 
create a military organization for the Jama'ah. The organization 
had a consultative council founded at that time. It was headed 
by Karam Zahdi, and among its members were Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, 
Muhammad 'Abd-al-Salam, 'Isam Darbalah, and others. Then 'Abbud 
al-Zumur joined, and the events of 1981 occurred. The State 
Security Agency chose the name "al-Jihad" for al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah's military organization. They wanted to lump us in 
with some other groups which had no role either in spreading the 
faith or in military action. We were joined by a small group, 
like that of Ayman al-Zuwahiri, and we met them in prison. 
Basically they were not members of al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah. They 
got out and formed their own organization, which had no relation 
to us, and was not an offshoot of ours. 
<H5>  'Abbud al-Zumur </H5>
  [Salah-al-Din] But 'Abbud al-Zumur split away from 
al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah in the mid-1980s, and with him a group of members 
who rejected 'Abd-al-Rahman's leadership of the organization. 
Al-Zumur is supposed to have said, "No leadership for the blind." 
  [Qasim] As I have said, for long years there has been no 
splitting away from al-Jama'ah. As to the case of our brother 
'Abbud, there were circumstances. He came back into al-Jama'ah 
nine months ago and is now a member of the consultative council. 
  [Salah-al-Din] How could you accept his return to the 
consultative council, knowing that he is Dr. 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman's chief rival? 
  [Qasim] It is not a question of rivalry. Al-Zumur held high 
office before going into prison. The truth of what transpired is 
that there was a discussion on the question of the leadership of 
the blind, and it went on for a time. Al-Zumur said that he 
wanted a religious edict deciding the issue, then he obeyed the 
consultative council's decision and came back into al-Jama'ah. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman agreed to be commander of al-Jama'ah only 
after he was persuaded, and after intense pressure. He did not 
want the job. I repeat that 'Abbud al-Zumur came back to 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah as if nothing had happened. 
  [Salah-al-Din] Why did Shawqi al-Shaykh and his group split 
off from al-Jama'ah and form an organization called 
"al-Shawqiyun" that has remained active even after al-Shaykh's 
murder? 
  [Qasim] This Shawqi al-Shaykh was never a member of 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah. He and his group were arrested during 
the police's campaigns in al-Fayyum against al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah. Neither he nor any of those with him were members, 
but they were tortured in prison and they became inclined to the 
charge of unbelief. We in al-Jama'ah have a policy on the charge 
of unbelief, and we undertook to prepare religious research on 
this subject. In any case, the existence of these small groups 
that appear now and then is the result of the government's 
practices and the restriction of the clergy to issuing religious 
edicts that serve to support the status quo. Even when Shaykh 
al-Ghazali spoke the truth in his testimony in the case of Faraj 
Fudah [assassinated secularist], there were vicious secularist 
attacks on him. 
  [Salah-al-Din] What do you think of al-Shawqiyun's armed 
attacks on the gold shops and seizure of non-Muslims' money? 
  [Qasim] We do not approve of this issue from the point of 
view of legitimacy. It is an extremely complicated issue, which 
has detailed precepts, because Islam is against stealing, 
killing, and treachery, except in time of war. Thus we do not 
approve of the seizure of the money of any person in this way 
without the precepts set out by the clergy. 
  [Salah-al-Din] But the deeds that you are committing also 
hurt innocent people. 
  [Qasim] When we carry out our operations we are careful not 
to hit any member of the general public. The operations are 
aimed at the targeted person. The proof is that we carried out 
the assassination attempt on former Interior Minister Zaki Badr 
in a desert area, far from populated areas, so that no innocent 
person would be injured. In any case, if someone happens to be 
in a place where one of our operations is carried out, and he is 
hurt, we feel sorry for him. I affirm that none of our 
operations has ever hurt anyone. The bombings were attributed to 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, for example, but the truth is that we 
did not do them. When members of al-Jama'ah carry out an 
operation, we announce it. We did not say this out of fear, or 
to dodge blame, or to seek praise. 
  [Salah-al-Din] But you killed a British [woman] tourist and 
wounded others in your operations striking at tourism in Egypt. 
  [Qasim] We have an opinion of the tourism issue. The 
government's economy depends on the tourism sector, and so 
striking at tourism means striking the economy, and thus 
striking at the regime itself. The intention is not to kill 
tourists themselves. We are against tourists, because the money 
they pour into the government treasury every year means that the 
regime, which according to our belief should be eliminated, 
remains in power. The revival of tourism in Egypt puts obstacles 
in the way of our establishing an Islamic state in Egypt. 
  [Salah-al-Din] Who issues the religious edicts to kill? 
  [Qasim] This is a matter of legislative vote in al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah. 
  [Salah-al-Din] Who are its members? 
  [Qasim] I am not in a position to mention names, but I may 
say that they have reached the [academic] level of independent 
reasoning as defined by scholars of Islamic jurisprudence. We 
have, in al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, a fairly good number of such 
scholars--more than dozens. 
  [Salah-al-Din] Was an edict issued for the killing of Major 
General Ghabarah? Is there an edict to kill all policemen? 
  [Qasim] We draw a distinction between killing and combat. In 
the case of a killing, there must be a specific edict against a 
killer, or someone who has taken part in the killing of one of 
our brothers, or represents part of the organization. In the 
case of combat, that usually takes place during an all-out 
confrontation, as happened in Dayrut. Young men there are 
considered to be in a combat situation with the police and all 
their representatives, because they attack these youths and 
their families. They consider all of them enemies. If you take a 
pigeon and want to kill it, you will see it beat its wings, and 
you don't blame the pigeon for doing that. What of a Muslim man 
seeing these practices, when he considers that any security 
force that takes part in these practices are bent on combat? 
  [Salah-al-Din] Who are those on the assassination lists that 
you have prepared? 
  [Qasim] This business of lists is just a form of provocation 
used against al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah. It is used by secularist 
writers and some government newspapers. Some provocation is 
accomplished, but I consider it laughable. It is said that we 
put people on assassination lists because they listen to Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Basit 'Abd-al-Samad reading the Koran. Can anyone 
believe that? There are some who say that we want to kill some 
artist. Our cause, and our chief enemies, are the ruling 
government and the group that cooperates with them. 
  [Salah-al-Din] Who is that group? 
  [Qasim] Anyone who supports or sustains the foundations of 
the regime. For example, who supports the regime? The State 
Security Agency, of course. Who is its tool? The police. I am 
amazed at people who value themslves so highly and claim that 
they are targets. This is not their time. Our confrontation now 
is with the regime. 
  [Salah-al-Din] What are your relations with the Copts? 
  [Qasim] We have a study on this topic, published in several 
installments in the magazine AL-MURABITUN. These Christians will 
never find justice anywhere but in an Islamic state. I believe 
that Egypt's security service is trying to prove that members of 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah are attacking Christians. There are also 
some Christian individuals who engage in dangerous practices, 
purposely stirring up trouble, in order to provoke State 
Security into striking at Islamists is some areas, thus 
achieving their aim. These practices are not in the interest of 
the Christians. I affirm that Muslims will never deal with them 
or rule over them except on the basis of justice. Justice is a 
duty for us, even towards those who have oppressed us. 
  [Salah-al-Din] But you killed 13 Christians in one day in 
Dayrut last year. 
  [Qasim] Dayrut is a special community. Christians have lived 
there for a very long time. No Christian has ever been a mayor 
in Egypt, except in Dayrut. Even so, there has never been any 
trouble before. The new thing is that one of the causes I 
mentioned did occur. There were practices that pushed the Muslim 
masses to defend themselves, so I do not attribute all the 
incidents at Dayrut to al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah. Most of the 
incidents that took place against Christians in Dayrut and 
elsewhere were natural reactions to practices that could have 
happened anywhere. 
  [Salah-al-Din] About six months ago, the subject of 
reconciliation between the Egyptian government and members of 
religious groups was brought up, but it ended with the dismissal 
of the interior minister, Major General Muhammad 'Abd-al-Halim 
Musa. What is your position now on dialogue and reconciliation? 
  [Qasim] The reconciliation between the government and 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah was, in our view, something cooked up by 
people with vested interests. Our point of view, which we 
announced in a communique, confirmed our rejection of 
reconciliation. 
  [Salah-al-Din] But one of al-Jama'ah's prominent members, 
Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani, made statements in one of the sessions of 
his trial to the effect that al-Jama'ah was prepared to stop the 
violence on certain conditions. Was he expressing a personal 
point of view, or al-Jama'ah's position? 
  [Qasim] Al-Jama'ah's point of view is the one that we 
announced in our communique. We say, has the policy of 
executions, military trials, and arrests imposed security? Is 
there any official who feels safe in his house, or at work, or 
at play? We have one demand. 
  Our basic demand is the establishment of an Islamic state. 
If 
they released all the detainees, and gave every one of us a job 
and lots of money to abandon this course, not one in a million 
would accept it. The confrontation would go on, with violence 
and combat. 
  [Salah-al-Din] Do the statements of Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani 
reflect a conflict inside al-Jama'ah, over the issue of 
reconciliation? 
  [Qasim] Al-Jama'ah has one specific position. Perhaps the 
prison conditions some of them are enduring, Safwat 
'Abd-al-Ghani among them, have moved them to say something to 
mitigate them. 
  [Salah-al-Din] The al-Jihad Organization has claimed 
responsibility for the assassination attempt on Interior 
Minister Hasan al-Alfi. Observers say that the organization used 
a method resembling that of al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah. Is al-Jihad 
now competing with al-Jama'ah after years of absence? 
  [Qasim] There is no such thing as the "al-Jihad 
Organization." This was a name given by the State Security 
Agency. 
  [Salah-al-Din] But there is an organization issuing 
communiques and carrying out violent operations, bearing the 
name al-Jihad. 
  [Qasim] I have mentioned that some of those who went out 
from 
the events of 1981, and got acquittals or short prison 
sentences, and never had any role in spreading the faith or 
military action, were tortured in prison. After they got out, 
they went to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Some of them called 
themselves the al-Jihad Group, then the al-Jihad Society. Ayman 
al-Zuwahiri was one of them. 
  [Salah-al-Din] How do you plan for al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah 
members in Pakistan and Afghanistan, especially as there are 
Egyptian efforts to extradite them? The al-Jihad Organization 
said that its members would gather in an Arab capital. Will you 
follow their example? 
  [Qasim] The security apparatus in Egypt has made a great 
deal 
of trouble for our brothers in al-Minya and Asyut, forcing them 
to move to Cairo and Alexandria. There was a time when our 
activity was confined to the governorates of al-Minya and Asyut, 
but they made trouble for the youths, who went to Cairo and 
Alexandria to spread the faith, and many joined them. After that 
they made it hard for them in all the governorates, and they 
were compelled to leave the country. They went to Afghanistan 
and Pakistan, and there they found that almighty God had a place 
for them. Now they are making it hard for them, so they are 
looking to go to other countries. I can promise that the 
Egyptian government will suffer terribly from them. It will want 
them back in al-Minya and Asyut. It will wish it had let them 
stay in the country. 
  [Salah-al-Din] According to some analyses, the mounting acts 
of violence in Upper Egypt are due to economic and social 
conditions, and that the random and poor areas in Cairo and the 
rest of Egypt's governorates produce the extremists. 
  [Qasim] That is shallow analysis, an attempt to escape from 
reality and the real confrontation. Is it a question of social 
and economic problems? I tell you we have brothers in al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah who have millions. If it were a question of revenge 
in Upper Egypt, then I point out to you our brothers who are 
from the Lower Egyptian governorates. 
  [Salah-al-Din] You have claimed responsibility for Mahjub's 
assassination, and the al-Jama'ah members accused in the case 
were acquitted. Did the accused carry out the operation? 
  [Qasim] Yes, al-Jama'ah claimed responsibility, and I 
believe 
that the failure of the police and state security to prepare 
investigations and a case was a reason for the innocent verdict. 
They relied on the methods they are used to using with 
al-Jama'ah members when they interrogate them to twist 
confessions out of them by torture. It is only natural that 
anyone who is tortured may speak the truth, or exaggerate, or 
say things which are untrue, to escape what is happening to him. 
Thus the judges found gaps in the case and handed down the 
innocent verdict. 
  [Salah-al-Din] You are opposed to the Supreme State Security 
courts, and the military courts, even though the Supreme State 
Security court handed down innocent verdicts in the Mahjub case. 
  [Qasim] My response to that is to mention what happened to 
me 
personally when I was in Denmark and found my name among those 
accused in the "Returnees from Afghanistan" case before the 
military court. A death sentence was issued against me. The 
brother who was executed after his conviction in the case of 
Sharif Ahmad Hasan--God knows he had never done anything that 
called for that sentence. 
  [Salah-al-Din] What will be al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah's 
reaction should the accused in the Mahjub case be tried again? 
  [Qasim] Their retrial, or failure to return them, would to 
us 
be a double disgrace. We know that our brothers who were found 
innocent will be trapped when they confront the military court, 
and may be sentenced to death. 
  [Salah-al-Din] Do you have links with the Muslim Brotherhood 
in Egypt? What is your view of their activities? 
  [Qasim] The Brotherhood are our brothers, and they have 
their 
direction and their way of operating. We know they have certain 
interests they want to protect. They believe that their 
interests are worthwhile; we do not think so. At any rate, such 
is their view, for which God will judge them. We believe that 
the regime's confrontation of Islamists is in phases. The early 
phase is al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, and then the Brotherhood's 
time will come. They did not leave them these seats in some of 
the syndicates for nothing. 
  [Salah-al-Din] How are al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah's activities 
funded? You are accused of getting money from certain countries, 
such as Iran. 
  [Qasim] I affirm that we have no connection with any country 
in the world. Even if the Egyptian Government could prove even 
one percent of this talk, it would have used it as proof. We do 
not accept contacts with countries or aid from them. Reality 
tells us that these countries only give for some goal of their 
own. Those who give, pay people whose support they seek, or whom 
they wish to use for some aim of their own. [The donors] want to 
take part in decisionmaking. We reject this. 
  [Salah-al-Din] So where do you get the arms and money for 
al-Jama'ah's activities? 
  [Qasim] These matters are not open to discussion. We accept 
aid from no one. 
<H5>  Iran </H5>
  [Salah-al-Din] How are your relations with Iran? 
  [Qasim] The Iranians are Shiites. Our difference with them 
is 
theological--what the clergy call contradiction. 
  [Salah-al-Din] What is your comment on the reports of human 
rights groups that strongly criticize the behavior of members of 
the religious groups? 
  [Qasim] If they are looking at reactions, that is unjust. 
They should reveal what is actually happening, then look at the 
reaction, but not using the same standards. I assert that what 
is happening among us are reactions, not actions.

  [Excerpt] During the extensive police hunt for outlaws, 
especially those involved in black terrorism, the Cairo 
Intelligence Directorate discovered two factories that produce 
various types of firearms in al-Sharabiyah, one of the hotbeds 
of crime in the capital. 
  Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi authorized 
generous rewards for the officers involved and the citizens who 
gave information about the two factories. Twenty rifles and 
revolvers, as well as weapons parts, and assembling machines 
were found. The owners confessed to Major General Mansur 
'Isawi, assistant interior minister for Cairo security, and 
Major General Mahmud Wajdi, director of the General Intelligence 
Directorate, that they sold weapons to outlaws at very high 
prices. The prosecution ordered that they be remanded and the 
two factories closed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Ali] </F>
  [Text] With the beginning of the new year, the Interior 
Ministry is preparing a major reshuffle of its apparatuses in 
Asyut Governorate. The reshuffle will involve 90 percent of the 
officers and undercover detectives in the State Security and 
Criminal Investigation Departments. The changes were approved 
after it was confirmed that terrorists know the names of most of 
the police officers operating in Asyut and can identify them. 
  The changes will be made in light of a new security strategy 
to confront terrorism. It involves staging intensive mobile 
patrols and fixed and mobile ambushes throughout the governorate 
and reinforcing the undercover police presence in the streets of 
the city of Asyut. 
  The new plan will change the locations of fixed civilian 
police ambushes. One plainclothes policeman will stand guard in 
front of the target that is being protected, while the other 
members of the ambush team will scatter over a 10-meter distance 
around the target so that they will not be easily hunted, like 
the victims of the recent terrorist attack were. 
  This plan was being developed at the same time that a large 
number of officers from the criminal investigation and special 
operation departments from the various governorates were 
arriving in Asyut. 
  In reaction to these security measures to crack down on the 
terrorist dens and the terrorist leaders, the Islamic Group in 
Upper Egypt has proclaimed its defiance, claiming that it has a 
strategy to confront them.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 30 Dec (MENA)--[passage omitted] The 
following is the text of the Interior Ministry's statement about 
this operation: [passage omitted] 
  The State Security Investigations prepared themselves for a 
large-scale campaign on al-Badari Island. The island is 
controlled by the al-Hamami family, which has a strong grip on 
this region. The commander of the military wing of the 
terrorist organization in Upper Egypt is terrorist Salah 
Muhammad 'Atiyah al-Hamami. 
  In view of the large area of the island--about 4,500 
feddans--and its rough topography, in addition to it being 
surrounded by the Nile, a full and comprehensive plan was 
prepared after two months of monitoring and scouting the island 
to determine all roads leading to and from it. 
  Forces of the highest level of combat training prepared for 
the raid. They were joined by international antiterrorism 
forces and armored and amphibious central security forces. 
These groups planned to storm the island and arrest all the 
individuals hiding there and using it as a headquarters to 
mastermind their operations. 
  The forces were aided by units from the Asyut Security 
Department, the Criminal Investigations Department, and various 
investigations groups because of the amount of information they 
have about this island. 
  At 0330 Wednesday, the forces stormed the island in extreme 
secrecy and conducted a thorough search. The forces entered the 
island according to plan and tightened their control over all 
the island's inlets and outlets. 
  The operation resulted in the death of the terrorist group's 
leader and commander of its military wing, Salah Muhammad 
'Atiyah al-Hamami, who was wanted in many terrorist cases, 
including Case 542/1993 of Markaz Sidfa. This case involves the 
assassination of Lieutenant Colonel Mahran 'Abd-al-Rahim, head 
of the State Security branch in (?Dayrut), and his son Muhammad. 
  This terrorist was regarded as the leader of the 
organization's military wing. He supervised the training, 
planning, and financing of the group's recent terrorist 
operations in Asyut, Qina, and Aswan Governorates. 
  An automatic rifle and a large quantity of ammunition were 
found in his possession. 
  Afterward, 57 active members of the terrorist organization 
surrendered to the raiding force. It turned out that some of 
them had carried out these operations, some had been in charge 
of training, and others were responsible for provisions, 
financial support, and conveying orders. All of them (?were) 
arrested. 
  The forces also seized papers, (?letters), and documents 
referring to operations that were being planned, including 
operations against some public figures and installations. The 
forces also seized other documents containing addresses of some 
of the organization's fugitive members in various governorates 
and providing important clues that will help the authorities 
arrest other fugitive terrorists. 
  Citizen Mustafa Kamil Ahmad 'Uthman was wounded in the 
clashes. He was hospitalized, and his current condition is 
positive. A Central Security Forces conscript, Rikabi Nur 'Ali, 
was killed. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif has 
affirmed that there can be no dialogue with terrorists because 
they are a group of schemers funded from abroad, similar to the 
German gangs. Their objective is to strike at political 
stability in Egypt and try to weaken its economy. They hide 
behind Islam although they are a misguided group. The majority 
of the Egyptian people are Muslim and do not need guardians or 
someone to teach them about Islam. 
  He said that the issue of terrorism in Egypt is different 
from the issue of terrorism in Algeria, where the terrorist 
groups succeeded in getting into parliament. But in Egypt the 
terrorists have failed to get into the People's Assembly or 
Consultative Council. They have also failed to infiltrate the 
ranks of the Army, security forces, and large institutions. 
  In addition, the terrorist phenomenon in Egypt is different 
from that in the United Kingdom, for example, due to the 
presence of the shadow government and some form of Irish 
independence from the United Kingdom. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 5 Jan (MENA)--Minister of Tourism Dr. 
Mamduh al-Biltaji has expressed optimism about the future of 
tourism in Egypt. [passage omitted] 
  At a meeting with a visiting U.S. Congressional delegation 
today, he reviewed the Tourism Ministry's future policy to 
revive tourism in Egypt, especially from the United States as an 
important tourism export market. 
  Speaking about Egypt's losses due to terrorism, he said 
Egypt 
has incurred losses at all levels. He added that these 
incidents have sharply and directly deepened the tourism crisis 
in Egypt. He noted that the number of tourists decreased from 
3.2 million in 1992 to 2.2 million as of October in 1993. 
Tourist nights decreased from about 20 million to around 13 
million as of October 1993 and tourism revenues dropped from 
$2.3 billion in 1992 to $1.1 billion as of October 1993. He 
pointed out that these statistics are serious indications as to 
the severity of the crisis. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuwait, 6 Jan (KUNA) -- AL-WATAN newspaper today 
reported that Iraqi President Saddam Husayn has committed a new 
massacre against leaders from the Ba'th party who broke away 
from him years ago and sought refuge in Damascus. 
  The paper pointed out that Iraqi intelligence prepared a 
plan 
to lure a number of Iraqi opposition leaders living in Syria to 
the Kurdish area and from there to Mosul, where they were left 
to contact active elements of the [Iraqi] opposition; then they 
were arrested. The paper added that the plan succeeded and that 
death sentences were carried out on at least 10, including 
Muhammad al-Tai, who was described as a member of the dissident 
Iraqi regional command. 
  Sources of the dissident Iraqi regional command leadership 
in 
Damascus remained silent, but AL-WATAN paper reported these 
sources as saying that al-Tai acted individually and without 
orders from the leadership. 
  The paper said it was announced in Mosul that the bodies of 
five victims have been received, and that the rest are believed 
to have been killed during interrogation.

  [Text] The Palestine National Liberation Movement, Fatah, 
the General Command of the al-'Asifah Forces [Fatah-the 
Uprising], has issued a military statement, saying: 
  To uphold our faith in armed struggle as the major course to 
be taken to liberate the entire Palestinian national soil, the 
heroic al-'Asifah revolutionaries affiliated with the group of 
heroic martyr Abu-'Ali Mahdi crossed into Palestine last night, 
determined to keep the revolution going until victory, even if 
they had to meet death. [see items TA3012053593 and NC3012094693 
in previous Terrorism Report] They managed to cross what the 
enemy and its agents call the border strip in southern Lebanon 
as well as the enemy's security fences. They arrived in 
northern Palestine and the Dan area and clashed with a 
mechanized military patrol in Upper Galilee in a heroic and 
daring operation that continued from 0300 to 0430 on 30 December 
1993. They destroyed an enemy military vehicle, killing or 
wounding some of its occupants. This forced the enemy to use a 
large number of its troops as well as airborne paratroopers in 
the operation. 
  The statement issued by the Fatah Movement, the General 
Command of the al-'Asifah Forces, added: The enemy has admitted 
that the operation took place, acknowledged that it suffered 
some casualties, and attempted to minimize its losses, as usual. 
However, it has repeatedly said through its news media that it 
is the first operation of its kind for a long time in which our 
heroes have managed to breach the Zionist entity's security 
fences. 
  During the heroic clash with the enemy, three fedayeen were 
martyred. They are the following: Patrol commander heroic 
martyr Lieutenant Ahmad Amin Qa'qur, born in 1971, Amman, he 
hailed from Tarqumiyah, Hebron; heroic martyr 1st Sergeant 
Ashraf Hammad Mansur, born in 1970, Dar'a, he hailed from 
Beersheba; and heroic martyr 1st Sergeant Ahmad Rafiq al-Mallah, 
born in 1973, Nahr al-Barid, he hailed from 'Illar, Tulkarm.

  [Excerpts] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] today complied 
with the request of Fatah leaders in the Gaza Strip, and in the 
context of the understandings reached with them, released the 
five armed terrorists who were arrested in two incidents 
yesterday. [passage omitted] 
  Palestinian sources noted that the five are members of 
(al-Tanzim al-Siri), a secret organization of Fatah usually used 
for internal killings. 
  Processions and rallies were held today to mark the 29th 
anniversary of the establishment of Fatah. One rally, in 
Palestine Square, turned into a riot during which six locals 
were wounded by soldiers' gunfire, including a 60-year-old 
woman. A youngster who threw an explosive charge at the 
soldiers was also shot and wounded in the leg. 
  Thirty-five-year-old 'Azzam al-Aymuni was murdered in Hebron 
this morning. He was shot dead while walking in Hebron's 'Isa 
neighborhood. His body was taken to the forensic institute. He 
was apparently murdered on suspicion of being a collaborator. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 2 January 
adds that "two firebombs were thrown at a fuel tanker in Hebron. 
The bombs shattered on the road. Soldiers escorting the tanker 
opened fire at the perpetrators, but they fled the scene."]

<F P=106> [Report by Jon Immanuel and Raine Marcus] </F>
  [Excerpts] A man claiming to be a Fatah Hawk from the Khan 
Yunus refugee camp said yesterday he murdered two Israeli drug 
addicts in Ramla last Friday. Three other Gazans also 
participated in the murders, according to a leaflet. 
  Fatah is committed to refraining from attacks on Israelis 
under the Israel-PLO accord. 
  A man claiming to be Ihsan Farid Qaysi, 21, told Palestinian 
reporters in Gaza that he left his ID card with the bodies of 
the two Israelis to prove he killed them. 
  Hayim Weizmann, 30, and David Bublil, 44, were found hacked 
to death in their Ramla apartment; the blood-stained kitchen 
knife used in the killing was left nearby. Police also found 
part of an identity card belonging to a Gaza Arab, who security 
services are still hunting. Nothing had been stolen from the 
apartment, and a leaflet taking responsibility for the murder 
was left there. [passage omitted] 
  A leaflet pasted on the wall of the Khan Yunus central 
mosque 
said that a group called "The martyrs of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish" 
killed the two in revenge for the death of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish, a 
Fatah Hawk. Troops killed Abu-al-Rish by mistake a few days 
after he had surrendered and was released in November under an 
amnesty offered to wanted Fatah gunmen. [passage omitted] 
  Fatah officials said opponents of the peace accord may have 
been trying to implicate Fatah in the murder of Israelis to 
destroy the peace process. 
  According to the ASSOCIATED PRESS, Fatah officials in Gaza 
said they had issued no orders for any operation and any Fatah 
activist involved was acting on his own.

  [Excerpt] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, Jan 3 
(AFP)--[passage omitted] On Monday, Palestinian sources here 
said Israeli troops have arrested two members of PLO chief Yasir 
'Arafat's Fatah faction who are suspected of murdering two 
Israelis last week. 
  In a raid Sunday on the Gaza Strip's Khan Yunus refugee 
camp, 
they arrested Farid al-Qaysi, 21, and 'Ala Abu-Sita, 20, on 
charges of killing alleged drug dealers Hayim Weizmann, 34, and 
David Bublil, 41, near Tel Aviv last Friday. 
  The two were reportedly seen writing on the main Khan Yunus 
mosque that "the Ahmad Abu-Rish group carried out the murder of 
the two Zionist dogs at al-Ramlah to avenge the army's killing 
of Ahmad Abu-Rish." 
  Al-Qaysi, Abu-Sita and two other Palestinians who were at 
large had shown camp residents four ears they said they had cut 
from their victims, Palestinians said. 
  Undercover Israeli troops shot dead Ahmad Khalid Abu-Rish, a 
20-year-old member of the Fatah Hawks, on November 28, shortly 
after he had been set free from prison. 
  The Hawks vowed afterwards to resume their armed attacks 
which they had abandoned on Arafat's orders following the 
September 13 autonomy accord. 
  The army also arrested Muhammad Abu-Rish, a former member of 
the Islamic Jihad movement who had been pardoned at the same 
time as his brother Ahmad. 
  Soldiers also raided the al-Burayj camp and arrested Yasir 
Taha, 20, a member of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qasim, the armed wing 
of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).

<F P=106> [Article: "Hizballah: Dreading the Countdown Phase?"] </F>
  [Text] Many informed observers are attributing Lebanon's 
existing tensions, which are brought about by Hizballah's 
confrontational positions against officials and the government, 
to a variety of reasons, which have nothing to do with the 
circumstances and the timing of the Gaza-Jericho First 
Agreement, which was signed in the White House on the 13th of 
this month [September]. 
  These observers believe that the al-Ghubayri demonstration, 
along with the regrettable and unjustifiable loss of life, which 
accompanied it, was not the cause of the confrontational 
posture, which Hizballah and all those who move in its circles 
assumed. It was rather a product of that confrontational 
posture, which all those who have been working with Hizballah 
and those who have been striving to run it also assumed. [These 
incidents] show, as the observers add, that grief or anger over 
the loss of life was not the essence of the problem for those 
who "burned their bridges." Nor was their attitude toward the 
'Arafat-Israeli agreement the essence of the problem or the 
reason for the sharp and hard-line positions that were taken and 
expressed in the rhetoric of the previous hateful war. The 
people who took those positions were trying to throw the country 
once again into the gloom of internecine fighting and 
divisiveness. 
  The essence of the problem, which uses the blood of victims 
as its slogan, has to do with feelings of dread about the 
countdown phase. Hizballah leaders fear that this phase might 
have started and that its onset could signal the end of what the 
party has been representing over the past years since it was 
founded. 
  There are reasons for those feelings of dread, and the most 
notable of them have to do with the new equations that are 
emerging in the region. These equations do not show Hizballah 
having the same regional prestige that it had over the past 
years. 
  Another notable reason for those feelings of dread has to do 
with developments in Lebanon under a state of peace. The 
direction in which these developments are moving tends to 
highlight the real magnitude of those forces that, like the 
Lebanese forces for example, rode the wave of war in Lebanon and 
appeared to be larger than they really were. Today, the Lebanese 
Forces appear to be like one of the ordinary partisan Christian 
forces, whereas in the past their prestige and influence made 
them appear to be representing Christians in Lebanon. 
  This factor applies to Hizballah, too. In a state of peace 
Hizballah cannot possibly represent more than 10 percent [of the 
population] under the best of circumstances, particularly when 
we learn that Hizballah pursues its activity among Shiites, and 
most Shiites, like other sectarian groups in Lebanon, tend to 
renounce the previous war in all its forms. 
  Another salient reason for those feelings of dread has to do 
with Hizballah's brittle organizational and political makeup. 
The tight, or rather rigid, form of that organization is 
considered an indirect indication of the confluence of various 
tendencies, each with its own nature, characteristics, and 
interests. Hizballah's makeup is also considered an indication 
of the fact that the party has brought together groups who are 
dominated by pressure from Iran and driven by interests and 
politics. 
  Other than those reasons for Hizballah's dread there are 
other reasons that have to do with Iran. Iran is always sending 
out signals indicating that it would soon abandon its support 
for Hizballah, the party that was basically founded by Iran. 
Hizballah has relied on the enormous financial assistance, that 
it has been and is still receiving from Tehran. It is this 
financial assistance, which enabled Hizballah to expand its base 
and build and strengthen its agencies. 
  In this regard everyone remembers the statements made by 
'Ali 
Akbar Mohtashemi, Hizballah's founder and the former interior 
minister of Iran. Mr. Mohtashemi, whose statements were critical 
of Iran's policies, called upon Hizballah to be vigilant and to 
reach beyond what the state of Iran was trying to forge in its 
international relations. 
  All these feelings of dread came to a head the moment when 
the 'Arafat-Israeli agreement was reached. It was a moment, 
which suggested that doors leading to the resolution of issues 
in the Arab-Israeli conflict were being opened. New conditions 
would then ensue, and Hizballah would find no place for itself 
under those new conditions. Hence, it became evident that 
Hizballah was losing no time in its quest for a confrontation. 
It was doing that by becoming the driving force behind what 
happened during and after the al-Ghubayri demonstration. In 
doing that, Hizballah is seeking guarantees for its survival. 
  AL-SHIRA' discusses in three articles in this issue these 
designations for the feelings of dread, which are being felt in 
Hizballah. The first and second articles, which are AL-SHIRA's, 
discuss details, which have to do with the party, with the 
positions of its leaders, and with the circumstances under that 
the party acts. The third article, which is by Amir Taheri, was 
published by our fellow newspaper, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT. That 
article discusses the reality of Iranian politics today.

<F P=106> [Article: "Process of Sorting Out Matters in Hizballah </F>
Begins; Fadlallah Under Microscope"] 
  [Text] "From now on no one in Damascus or in Tehran is to 
rein Hizballah." Was this an emotional slip of the tongue 
prematurely articulated by one of Hizballah's representatives in 
Lebanon's parliament, or was it part of a new tactic set forth 
by the party to get out of the cycle of deadlines, namely, the 
coming agreements with the Zionist enemy? Hizballah must now 
either respond to that situation, or it must break the hold, 
which that situation has over it. If it tries to break the hold, 
it could use force. But if it goes along with those agreements, 
Hizballah will have to use political methods. The al-Ghubayri 
demonstration was Hizballah's dress rehearsal for breaking out 
of this cycle. 
  Was this calculated "slip of the tongue" an indication of a 
new distribution in the balance of power in Hizballah? Did it 
come out to indicate a new beginning [in the party]? And if 
there is a new distribution of power in the pro-Iranian party, 
who is the preeminent power now? 
  Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah contends that he controls 
70 
percent of Hizballah's power, policy, and decisions. Does this 
mean that Hizballah's decisions are actually Fadlallah's to make? 
  We will not join the chorus of those who are questioning the 
significance of the denial that always accompanies the Sayyid's 
utterances when reference is made to his relationship to the 
party. That denial is now considered by some to be confirmation 
of the Sayyid's relationship to the party as well as an 
indication of the fact that the reference to the 70 percent 
[which he claims to control] did not come out of nowhere. 
  We will not question [the significance of the denial] 
because 
behind the Sayyid's control of the party is something that 
reaches beyond the boundaries of the geographic decision between 
the party's Consultative Council and the Sayyid's home. Both are 
located in Bi'r al-'Abd, a few meters apart. 
  Sayyid Fadlallah is setting himself up to become something 
more than the party's spiritual guide in Lebanon. He is setting 
himself up to become the marja'iyah shi'iyah 'ammah [the supreme 
Shiite source of emulation: marja'-al-taqlid]. His reach, of 
course, would extend beyond the boundaries of Lebanon where 
Shiites make up more or less one-third of the population. In 
Iran, however, Shiites make up more than two-thirds of the 
population, and that same percentage may also exist in Iraq and 
in some Gulf countries. 
  The Sayyid printed his treatise to set the stage for 
establishing a link between him, the treatise, and the 
muqallidin [emulators of a mujtahid]--if they wanted to have 
such a link. That link would also be established with disciples 
or persons who want to meet their obligations by paying khums 
and zakah [tax and alms tax, respectively, paid by Shiites to 
the source of emulation, that is, marja'-al-taqlid]. These 
payments provide enormous amounts of money, which the budget of 
each institution of a supreme Shiite source of emulation has to 
have to ensure the success of its role. 
  The fact of the matter is that there is a thin line linking 
Fadlallah's statement about controlling 70 percent of the party 
with his efforts to set himself up for the institution of the 
supreme Shiite source of emulation. After all, Hizballah is 
Iran's most prominent foreign tool, and as such, its importance 
stems from its effectiveness in one of Iran's most dangerous 
areas of activity. That is an area where Shiites have a popular 
presence; it is an area that has borders with Palestine (the 
control of the Zionist enemy); and it is an area where the 
struggle in the Palestinian question has gone into a new phase. 
The course of that struggle for many years in the future will 
be determined by the West and through direct contact with the 
West, primarily the United States of America. 
  Iran established Hizballah so that it can play an effective 
role in Lebanon. But when Iran established Hizballah, it had to 
have a leader for the party whose religious and political nature 
was the same as that of Iran. At the time Iran found that leader 
in Lebanon's Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, an official of 
al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party. It made a deal with him 
according to which Fadlallah joined Hizballah in return for the 
public dissolution of al-Da'wah [the Islamic Call] Party. 
  Although the dissolution of the Lebanese chapter of 
al-Da'wah 
[Islamic Call] Party created problems and difficulties for him 
with the original party in Iraq, which was founded by Sayyid 
Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, Sayyid Fadlallah managed to deal 
promptly with those problems. The dissolution of that chapter 
made it possible for the Sayyid to play a distinguished role in 
Lebanon throughout the period of the confrontation between Iran 
and the West. Hizballah, which needed a spiritual guide in 
Lebanon, was the vehicle by means of which Fadlallah played that 
role. Furthermore, Sayyid Fadlallah did not offer his positions 
to the party free of charge. He rather tried to implant himself 
within the party by using the cadres he was grooming. Those 
cadres, who made up the student organization of al-Da'wah 
[Islamic Call] Party, were known as the Association of Muslim 
Students. 
  During the period of Imam Khomeyni's presence Sayyid 
Fadlallah played the part, which Iran wanted him to play. At the 
same time he was preparing himself for the post-Imam Khomeyni 
period. After all, he turned out to be the most fortunate party 
in the confrontation, which occurred between supporters of Imam 
Khomeyni and Shaykh Hoseyn 'Ali Montazeri, Khomeyni's successor. 
That confrontation ended in the ouster of Shaykh Montazeri from 
the position of succession. 
  Sayyid Fadlallah was fortunate in this confrontation and its 
outcome because a principal obstacle, which could have 
obstructed his private plan to set himself up as the supreme 
Shiite source of emulation had been removed. Shaykh Montazeri 
was the last mujtahid in Iran [a religious leader who makes and 
issues independent interpretations of theological questions] who 
was also a source of emulation. He was the last such religious 
figure to uphold the notion of a jurisconsult's guardianship. 
With him out of the picture and then with the departure of the 
imam, proponents of an Islamic republic and of the guardianship 
of a jurisconsult found no one to perform the part of a 
spiritual guide but Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, who had not yet 
completed his treatise. This meant that Sayyid Fadlallah was no 
longer under the obligation of following Khamene'i. Since 
Fadlallah had completed his treatise, he was more learned and 
more knowledgeable than Khamene'i, and he was not required, 
therefore, to follow his guidance. (AL-SHIRA' had published in a 
previous issue that Fadlallah had printed his treatise and had 
placed it for safekeeping in a warehouse.) Accordingly, it was 
Fadlallah and not Khamene'i who deserved to become the supreme 
source of emulation in the context of accepting a Khomeyni style 
guardianship of a jurisconsult. 
  Sayyid Fadlallah was even more fortunate in the departure of 
Sayyid Abolqasem Kho'i, the world's supreme Shiite source of 
emulation, who had objected to the universal application of a 
Khomeyni-style guardianship of a jurisconsult. Sayyid Kho'i had 
also objected to the establishment of an Islamic government, 
particularly since the person who was favored by most Shiite 
Muslims to become the supreme source of emulation was Seyyed 
Reza Golpayegani, a man who was over 90 years old and who was 
also opposed to the Khomeyni-style guardianship of a 
jurisconsult. Iranians had consented to his proposal that Seyyed 
Khamene'i be nominated to succeed Seyyed Golpayegani as the 
supreme source of emulation until circumstances are straightened 
out. 
  The fact that Sayyid Fadlallah and Iran parted company on 
this matter seems normal here because Sayyid Fadlallah himself 
wanted to become the supreme source of emulation. That Khamene'i 
should become the supreme source of emulation before completing 
his own ijtihad [independent interpretation and judgment in 
theological questions] treatise was something that Fadlallah 
could not rationalize. 
  What would Fadlallah do if Tehran were to decline supporting 
him or if it were to confine the source of emulation to its 
borders or show that Fadlallah had departed from its policy? 
  Would he, the man who controls 70 percent of Hizballah, 
resort to inciting the party against Tehran? 
  Was this the context for that slip of the tongue by 
Hizballah's representative in parliament? 
  Will other forces within the party remain silent about 
Fadlallah's pro-al-Da'wah Party stance? Will they remain silent 
if Fadlallah decides to present and circulate his treatise and 
accept the position of becoming the source of emulation? 
  Whereas Lebanon has exposed Fadlallah to confrontations 
stemming from Hizballah's defiance of the Lebanese state's 
decisions and the state's determination to prevent Lebanon from 
becoming an arena for conflict and for the settlement of scores, 
Hizballah from now on will be exposed to more incompatible 
positions, which have already started to manifest themselves. At 
first, the cost of these incompatible positions in the 
al-Ghubayri demonstration seemed high. (See the previous issue 
of AL-SHIRA'.) The sorting that became evident in that 
demonstration was between the different slogans of Sayyid 
Fadlallah's supporters who had lined up together in a manner 
that distinguished them from others, and between the Party's 
fundamentalists who are led by Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. More of 
this sorting will take place in the coming days, and the 
position of Sayyid Fadlallah himself will be scrutinized 
locally, regionally, and internationally. Why Fadlallah? 
  Because Fadlallah, according to his own assessment, is the 
one who controls the party, he is the one who will use this 
control to get the party to block an agreement between Lebanon 
and Israel, that is, if he takes no action about any agreement, 
which Damascus might reach with Israel in the context of the 
prescribed settlement. 
  Will he decide to confront Israel's coming agreements with 
Lebanon and with Syria? Will he object to them and fight against 
them, or will he be satisfied with the lesson of the al-Ghubayri 
demonstration? Will he give his political concerns a religious 
dimension, which he will be careful to extend beyond the 
boundaries of Lebanon? 
  An answer to that question will not be long in coming. From 
now on let us watch Lebanon much more closely than we did any 
time in the past.

<F P=106> [Article: "Al-Da'wah Party Put Things in Motion From </F>
al-Ghubayri"] 
  [Text] The Association of Muslim Students, a student 
organization that is a cover for al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party 
in Lebanon, launched its action from al-Ghubayri. Shaykh Hasan 
'Awwad was the students' imam in the regional mosque. 
  Shaykh 'Awwad was not a member of al-Da'wah Party because, 
he 
said, he did not want to commit himself to any one party, 
regardless of what that party was. If he did [Shaykh 'Awwad 
thought], his conscience would be subject to the party's 
decisions and not to the credibility of faith. 
  At that time the most prominent figures of al-Da'wah Party 
were Shaykh Na'im Qasim, the party's current shaykh; Muhammad 
Ra'd, his current deputy; Muhammad al-Khansa; and Mahmud 
al-Qimati. In Lebanon their immediate loyalty was to Shaykh 'Ali 
Kurani, who was the brother-in-law of Sayyid Muhammad Husayn 
Fadlallah. Kurani, who is married to the sister of Sayyid 
Fadlallah's first wife, was preoccupied with the concerns of 
wealthy Shiites in the Gulf countries. He was therefore unable 
to maintain a harmonious relationship with members of Lebanon's 
al-Da'wah Party who, at the same time, were frequenting a 
turbaned member of al-Da'wah Party from al-Najaf. That man from 
al-Najaf, namely, Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, had pledged 
to Sayyid Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, the man who founded al-Da'wah 
Party in Iraq between 1957 and 1959, that he would become his 
representative in Lebanon. Sayyid Fadlallah, who started his 
activity in the Brotherhood Society in East Beirut, was forced 
by the civil war to leave East Beirut and go to the southern 
section of the city where he started his activity in the mosque 
of al-Sallum Quarter (al-Karamah Quarter). 
  The activity carried out by Sayyid Fadlallah as a member of 
al-Da'wah Party did not prevent him from speaking out on certain 
occasions as the representative of Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi 
Shams-al-Din, president of the Supreme Shiite Islamic Council. 
  Hizballah's most prominent leaders now may have been members 
of al-Da'wah Party. Among them we mention Shaykh Na'im Qasim, 
who serves as vice president of Hizballah. At the same time 
Shaykh Qasim serves Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah in a role like that, 
which was played by Saddam Husayn when Saddam served as deputy 
to then Iraqi president Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr. And there is 
Muhammad al-Khansa who functions in the political office. 
Actually, he is the one who runs that office in the presence of 
its chief, al-Hajj Husayn Khalil, one of Sayyid Muhammad Husayn 
Fadlallah's two former attendants. 
  Mahmud al-Qimati serves as the officer who is responsible 
for 
Hizballah's central funds. 
  Hasan Nasrallah, Na'im Qasim, and Muhammad Ra'd make up the 
trio in Hizballah's Consultative Council, which represents the 
fanaticism in al-Da'wah Party.

<F P=106> [Article: "Hizballah: Feelings of Muddling Through an </F>
Incurable Disease"] 
  [Text] An incongruous observation was 
made during the memorial service that was organized by Hizballah 
for the victims of the al-Ghubayri demonstration incident. This 
observation attracted attention when one of the shaykhs of 
Hizballah took it upon himself to change the significance that 
is associated with the life of [Imam] Husayn by presenting that 
life without mentioning the name of Imam Husayn or any member of 
his family. Not even Karbala' was mentioned. Instead, the person 
who was conducting the aforementioned memorial service proceeded 
to relate the story of al-Ghubayri incident in a mournful 
stammer, replacing the term, nonbelievers, with the term, 
Lebanese regime. Instead of speaking about Karbala', he spoke 
about al-Ghubayri and about the casualties of that 
demonstration. He spoke about the demonstration, which occurred 
early this month in 1993 instead of speaking about Imam Husayn 
and the martyrs who supported him and who lost their lives 
approximately more than 1,000 years ago. 
  This is actually the first time in the history of political, 
Shiite Islamic movements that an infringement is made upon what 
Shiites consider a sacred ritual, one that is always performed 
on all their religious occasions. That ritual is performed every 
year on the occasion of `Ashura.' In this sense the life of 
Husayn is read in a mournful tone to offer oneself consolation, 
to seek a blessing and a reward, and, at the same time, to stir 
the emotions by arousing feelings of affection for al-Husayn and 
for members of his family. When presented in this manner Imam 
Husayn's life and its significance constitute an important part 
of the Shiites' heritage, that heritage in which the political 
and the social are to a certain extent mixed with the religious. 
Accordingly, changing the significance of Husayn's life in the 
manner that occurred during the memorial service for the victims 
of the al-Ghubayri incident is considered reprehensible 
according to the standard Shiite Islamic practice in this 
regard. After all, a large segment of Shiite Muslims still 
refuse to make any change, even in the manner in which a 
memorial service is conducted. It is known that the aim of those 
who have been calling for change in the manner in which memorial 
services are conducted is to highlight the significance of these 
occasions by adopting an up-to-date manner. But the irony here 
lies in the fact that Hizballah has always taken a hard-line 
position, opposing all those calling for change, even those 
advocating that the gory ritual be changed so that the essence 
of the occasion can be presented in a new way. Now, however, 
Hizballah is boldly infringing on the essence of these occasions 
with one of its shaykhs [religious elders] presenting the life 
of Husayn during the aforementioned memorial service without 
making any mention whatsoever of either Imam Husayn or Karbala'. 
  Hizballah's action appears to be bold. Not only does it 
suggest that Hizballah has the legal and moral right to put its 
casualties on an equal par with the martyrs of Karbala', but it 
also has the legal and moral right to regard the al-Ghubayri 
incident an occasion in its own right equivalent to the Karbala' 
incident. Accordingly, Hizballah's actions suggest that the 
party would have no objection to adding the al-Ghubayri incident 
to those traditions, which are considered sacred by Shiite 
Muslims. 
  And yet, does Hizballah have the right to take such actions, 
which suggest that it has not only "the right" to impose a 
political point of view, but also "the right" to attach to it 
the religious justifications for making it sacred? Is it right 
for Hizballah to require not only the party's followers but also 
all Shiite Muslims to comply with that point of view? 
  In the past Hizballah introduced some political slogans into 
the Husayniyahs [buildings where Shiites gather for the recital 
of the sufferings of the Imams], which are recited by Shiite 
Muslims in Lebanon in an Iranian, not an Arabic accent. And yet, 
none of the incidents that the party had encountered in the past 
were placed on an equal footing with the battle of Karbala'. The 
al-Ghubayri incident was, however, when the life of Husayn was 
unabashedly incorporated into that incident. The party's 
leaders, who know quite well the standing that Husayn's life has 
in the hearts and minds of the Shiite public, found no 
difficulty in doing that. There is no doubt that the party 
deliberately wanted to show that Shiites in Lebanon were 
confused about the difference between the implication of 
infringing upon the party's standing and that of infringing upon 
the standing of Karbala'. Hizballah wants to use this 
"confusion" to create the illusion or to suggest that 
contradicting the party will be tantamount to contradicting the 
Shiite Islamic sect in its entirety and not only Hizballah. The 
party also wants to suggest that it is not possible to 
contemplate the military elimination of Hizballah because 
Hizballah, the underdog, will be around and will be coming 
around every year and assuming crisis proportions, just as the 
death of Imam al-Husayn in Karbala' comes up every year and is 
also mentioned on every Shiite occasion. 
<H5>  An Incurable Disease </H5>
  It seems clear that Hizballah's aim in pursuing such conduct 
is ultimately to cover itself in a Shiite Islamic cloak in an 
attempt to make itself appear larger than it really is. The 
question of Hizballah in Lebanon would then become a Shiite 
question and not a fundamentalist one or a partisan one. The 
notion of what lies behind this approach seems to be the crisis, 
which Hizballah is going through at this stage during which 
circumstances around the party are changing and threatening to 
make the party useless from the point of view of all which had 
hitherto justified its existence. Such a crisis would have 
severe psychological effects on Hizballah similar to those that 
would be endured by a patient who senses that his disease is 
incurable and that his days are numbered. Hizballah is actually 
experiencing such psychological sentiments, and these sentiments 
are growing every day and after each new incident. They are 
pointing out that the region is moving closer to the point of 
putting yesterday's Arab-Israeli conflict behind it in a manner 
that falls short of what is required on the possibilities of a 
rapprochement between Iran and Washington and also on the matter 
of extending the reach and range of the state in Lebanon. 
  The problem with Hizballah is that it is the product of 
these 
equations. Its significance and its role are also in part 
products of interactions among these equations. That is why 
Hizballah and the part it has been playing will undoubtedly drop 
out of the picture when these equations become history. In this 
regard the most dangerous matter facing this party is the fact 
that its internal makeup and its ideological concepts prevent it 
from renewing itself intellectually and organizationally in a 
manner that would make it a viable party in the new stage that 
is coming. The party would then have a new role to play and a 
new approach to take, both of which would be compatible with the 
spirit and the prospects of the new stage. For Hizballah renewal 
would mean abandoning its origins, and that means becoming a 
party without an identity. In the best of cases Hizballah would 
become another version of the Amal Movement, and it is known 
here that a second Amal Movement is not needed here on the 
Shiite Islamic scene. But even if Hizballah were to succeed in 
renewing its performance and its ideology--and that is an 
optimistic assumption--it would be exposing itself to violent 
internal upheaval that would lead to its dissolution and 
breakup, as its original component parts move away from each 
other within the party. Hizballah would once again revert to 
groups made up of small independent tendencies. Among these 
groups, for example, would be the al-Da'wah Party, Fadlallah's 
group, the group, which has security ties with Iran, and so on. 
Generally speaking then, the party would face dissolution and 
disintegration, and that means it would cease to exist. 
  Faced with all these probabilities, the best of which 
signifies the dissolution and demise of Hizballah, leaders of 
the party are trying during this 11th hour to do something 
extraordinary to avoid that destiny. Their actions in this 
regard, however, have been so tense and nervous that they 
believe that everything that is taking place around them can be 
regarded as a conspiratorial political plan against Hizballah. 
On the basis of such suspicions, which are like the hypochondria 
that often afflicts elderly patients and those who are on their 
death beds, the party cannot become convinced that after being 
fattened for the past 11 years--the time during which it was 
exploited politically--it will be prepared for slaughter and 
sacrificed soon like a sheep on the altar of the settlement, on 
the altar of a new stage of relations in the region, or on the 
altar of relations between the region and international powers. 
It is this sentiment that explains why the party sees any 
dispute between it and the state as an attempt by the latter to 
liquidate it. It is known that the threat of Hizballah's 
liquidation comes neither from the state nor from any other 
internal party, but rather from the nature of its organizational 
and political makeup. And that was one of the tools that 
Hizballah used during the foregoing stage. But when the sun does 
set on the last act of that stage in the region, it will also 
set on all its effects and its entire rationale. 
  There are observers who believe that there is a tendency 
within Hizballah's leadership, which realizes that the party's 
crisis stems from the nature of the challenges of the coming 
stage, a stage that rejects Hizballah's role and makeup. And yet 
that tendency is trying to conceal that fact so that it can 
prolong the party's life. It is trying to create within the 
party's ranks a passive unity that is not based on "harmony 
within the party." Instead, that passive unity draws its 
lifeblood from the assumption that "what is outside the party is 
to be feared." That is why this tendency is magnifying the sense 
that exists primarily within the party at this stage, and that 
sense is that there is an enemy lying in wait for the party. 
This tendency is magnifying the sense that the party is also 
being targeted by a conspiracy. 
  This tendency is counting on getting the party's ranks and 
all its groups preoccupied with the subject of security and that 
of getting ready to confront "the other." That would keep them 
from devoting their attention to the new conditions around them 
and subjecting those conditions to scrutiny and analysis. After 
all, such scrutiny and analysis, should they take place, would 
create within the party a debate, which the party's current 
leadership would not be able to contain. Such scrutiny and 
analysis would also expedite the internal dissolution of the 
party because in facing the question about the party's destiny 
rather than any other tactical or supplemental question, each 
one of the centers of power within the party will be trying to 
apply pressure to the others so that its own view might prevail, 
become the view that the other centers of power must adhere to, 
and provide it and the party with a way out. In pressing its 
point of view, each center of power will indicate that it will 
drop out of the party if its point of view is not adhered to. 
These centers of power say that they will walk away from the 
party since they do not have to stay in it simply because the 
other powers in the party have a different point of view. They 
say they will not wait voluntarily for what is thought will be 
the party's liquidation. 
  Postponing such a discussion under the pretext of having the 
party devote itself to getting ready to confront outside 
conspiracies is actually tantamount to pursuing a policy, which 
cannot be pursued indefinitely. Having conceded that, postponing 
this discussion is nevertheless considered an ideal policy for 
the party in its current position, given the nature of the 
party's principal character and leader, namely, Sayyid Husayn 
Nasrallah. Although the vast majority of Hizballah's members and 
cadres who had been Nasrallah's partners in intense field work 
have confidence in his approach to security and organization, 
the party's elders do not have that much confidence in him. Even 
those who like to use theological standards in dealing with him 
do not have much confidence in him. It is this quality that is 
associated with the secretary general of Hizballah that makes 
the matter of starting an intellectual, political discussion 
related to jurisprudence within the party a precarious step, 
given the absence of a leader who can make an intellectually 
decisive statement. And yet, having the party confront security 
deadlines at this stage requires that its organizational 
readiness be upgraded, and that is consistent with Sayyid 
Nasrallah's capabilities because the party has confidence in the 
skills he has in this regard. 
<H5>  Running Away to the Imam </H5>
  And yet, running away from the problem to the imam within 
the 
party is countered in some segments by a clear inclination to 
think calmly and deliberately about what the party has to do to 
get out of its crisis safely. These segments that are affiliated 
with Hizballah, especially those that have funds, are of the 
opinion that the party has to be diligent in [its efforts] to 
acquire Shiite characteristics so that fundamentalism in Lebanon 
and the new, rising political Shiism would become synonymous. 
Thus, it would become impossible for any internal or external 
power to think of doing away with fundamentalism in Lebanon as 
it is represented by Hizballah, because to think along those 
lines would be like thinking about doing away with a sect, not a 
[political] party. To think along those lines would endanger the 
fundamental balance of the country, not just one number in a 
political game. 
  There are several reasons why making this equation workable 
in the material world does not appear to be easy. Most 
important, there is the Amal Movement whose presence represents 
a dominant Shiite tendency, on the one hand, and a substantial 
national tendency, on the other. There is, therefore, a bold 
line of distinction between rising political Shiism, as 
represented by Amal, and partisan fundamentalism, which can be 
found among Shiites, as represented by Hizballah. Although these 
facts are keeping Shiites from becoming a rising fundamentalist 
[movement] in Lebanon, providing Hizballah with a cover or a 
religious front, their importance is not diminished by the fact 
that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan, the distinguished Ja'fari 
mufti, linked what Hizballah might face to what is being planned 
for Shiite Muslims as a sect in Lebanon. He made that link in 
the speech he delivered at the memorial service for the victims 
of the al-Ghubayri incident. In the eyes of the vast majority of 
Shiites this link will appear to be emotional and unjustified. 
In fact, what Shaykh Qabalan said is being thoughtlessly cited 
in a manner that would move Shiites in Lebanon to become a 
sect-like entity whose existence will be contingent upon new and 
developing political factors. And yet, what must be believed is 
that the presence of Shiites in Lebanon is not the subject of a 
wager about whether a new political incident will or will not 
occur. It is instead something that has to do with the survival 
of Lebanon as an entity. The presence of Shiites in Lebanon is 
something that draws its lifeblood from matters that go beyond 
changing and alternating political equations, no matter how 
far-reaching these equations might be. 
  At any rate, Hizballah, for a variety of reasons that have 
to 
do with its interests, will be compelled to apply pressure so 
that it can protect itself behind a Shiite front. Furthermore, 
there is a tendency within Hizballah that is trying to open its 
doors to other Islamic and Christian Lebanese sects. Proponents 
of that tendency are of the opinion that at this stage the party 
has to abandon the shrill positions it has been taking in 
Lebanon so that it can become a Lebanese party rather than a 
fundamentalist party, which can be attacked easily. And yet that 
approach continues to be weak because of the party's makeup, 
role, and hardline concepts, all of which have been reviewed 
above. 
<H5>  Two Possibilities </H5>
  While proposals within Hizballah for the party's development 
and renewal continue to be tantamount to cries in the 
wilderness, those within the party who have more influence are 
those who lay out the choices for the situation in the future, 
using the same standards, which the party has been using to 
weigh the positions that it must take. The standards that are 
being referred to here are those which attempt to play the game 
of regional considerations, particularly as they manifest 
themselves in Iran. Accordingly, proponents of that way of 
thinking who have the lion's share of influence on the party's 
decisions argue about which one of two possible occurrences is 
more likely. 
  The first possible occurrence involves Tehran and Ankara. 
Recently, it became evident to both Iran and Turkey that Soviet 
Asia will not become the new area where they can exercise their 
regional influence because the republics in that section of Asia 
continue to look at Russia as their big brother who can solve 
their problems. Accordingly, Tehran and Ankara, particularly 
Tehran, will find themselves compelled to intensify the process 
by means of which their regional policies would be steered 
toward the Arab East and concentrated there. That will breathe 
new life once again into Hizballah as a factor in Iran's foreign 
policy that is to be weighed in. Consequently, the party will 
have new regional reasons to help it surmount the dividing line 
of having its role terminated in the coming stage. 
  The second possible occurrence is one that can be noted with 
pleasure, but it is one that calls for reservation and caution. 
This is because Iran could be persuaded with regional gains or 
with desperately needed economic gains, provided its foreign 
policies in the region are held in check. If Iran is persuaded 
by these temptations, Tehran might either tell Hizballah to take 
a step backwards, or it might cut it off and let it face its 
destiny all by itself. 
  But why would Tehran respond now to temptations such as 
those 
that have already been mentioned? 
  In answering that question proponents of the second possible 
occurrence in Hizballah say that there are several reasons why 
Tehran would respond to these temptations. Most important, 
economic conditions in Iran are deteriorating, and there is a 
desperate need for foreign assistance. Actually, Japan has been 
playing an active role for quite some time to persuade Iran to 
accept the following proposition: Tokyo will try to help Iran 
internationally by persuading the West to ease the blockade 
placed around Iran. [Toyko said] "You, Iranians, however, will 
have to help us prove that you have abandoned those foreign 
policies that provoke the United States of America." 
  It seems that Tehran has been trying, even as we speak, to 
deal with this Japanese proposition with much attention. It is 
going along with it little by little. However, the prime 
minister of Japan recently approached Iranian leaders and spoke 
to them courteously. He told them, "If you want the assistance 
we give you to be more effective in ending the undeclared 
international blockade against you, you will have to refrain 
from actions that oppose the Gaza-Jericho First Agreement." 
  And now the Japanese are waiting for Iran's answer, and the 
answer that Iran will give Tokyo will be one that we, of course, 
will not hear. If Iran's answer is "yes," that will undoubtedly 
mean that Hizballah has lost the basic dimension it has had in 
the region for a decade. During that time that dimension has 
been the secret of Hizballah's survival. When that time comes, 
Hizballah may find that the only thing it can do to serve its 
own purpose is to proclaim the slogan, "Death to Japan."

<F P=106> [Article by Mr Sadiq al-Musawi: "Beware of Mr Hasan </F>
Nasrallah's Wiles"] 
  [Text] If swindling people, tricking the gullible, and 
being hypocritical with the people are among the conditions for 
leadership in Lebanon, let us declare that Sayyid Hasan 
Nasrallah has outdone the competition in those areas. How else 
could a young man under the age of 37 who has not even mastered 
the externals of religious subjects move ahead so swiftly? 
Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, who has no social assets, has set no 
precedent by formulating independent interpretations of 
theological questions and has not risen to any level in his 
thinking. And yet, he rose swiftly from serving as a group 
official in al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party to serving as an 
official in the Amal Movement. Then he became Hizballah's 
mobilization officer in al-Biqa', served as commander of the 
party's fighters against the Amal Movement in Iqlim al-Tuffah, 
and [eventually] became the secretary general of Hizballah in 
Lebanon. Nasrallah managed to move ahead of outstanding scholars 
as well as leading formulators of independent theological 
interpretations, masters of thought, and our predecessors in the 
quest for Islam. How was he able to move ahead of all these 
people so swiftly? 
  Let us mention the following facts to support our 
allegations: 
  1. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, group official in al-Da'wah 
Party, 
managed to persuade people that he had never joined the 
aforementioned party. Some people in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran fell for that ploy and believed him. Sayyid Hasan thus 
became the clean man whose personal and social history was 
untarnished. It is worth noting that Sayyid Nasrallah's name was 
cleared by key figures of al-Da'wah Party who denied his 
affiliation with the party because they knew how much the young 
people who were fond of Imam Khomeyni's approach, may God be 
pleased with him, hated al-Da'wah Party. They hated it because 
the party had made fighting Imam Khomeyni's approach its 
strategic goal. That had been the party's goal ever since the 
Holy Imam Khomeyni arrived in the holy city of al-Najaf 
following his exile from Turkey, where he had lived after the 
late Shah exiled him from Iran in 1963. By clearing Nasrallah's 
name the key figures of al-Da'wah Party were able to set the 
stage for Nasrallah to gain access to the decisionmaking 
position. Nasrallah would gain such access after gaining the 
confidence of sincere young people and after officials in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran were persuaded that his background was 
spotless. 
  2. Sayyid Hasan has held in Hizballah, ever since it was 
founded, a position from which he could deal directly with the 
party's elements. He became the mobilization officer in the 
party, and that gave him the opportunity to present himself to 
those elements as a humble person and to portray himself as 
someone who empathizes with the dispossessed and their concerns. 
But it was the cadres of al-Da'wah Party who had penetrated 
Hizballah who took part in polishing Sayyid Hasan's image and 
presenting it to these gullible youths. Consequently, a large 
segment of the party's elements became fond of Sayyid Hasan 
because they believed he was a humble man, indifferent to the 
objects of this world, and troubled by the concerns of the 
toiling classes. Some of these young people even preferred 
Sayyid Nasrallah to his professors, the late Sayyid 'Abbas 
al-Musawi, may God have mercy on his soul; Shaykh Subhi 
al-Tufayli; and Shaykh Muhammad Yazbak. These were the men who 
preceded Nasrallah in associating themselves with the blessed 
Islamic Revolution after its victory in 1979. In this regard 
suffice it to point out that after Sayyid Nasrallah received a 
majority of the votes of the members of the Consultative Council 
in the elections, which followed the expiration of Shaykh Subhi 
al-Tufayli's term as secretary general, he yielded to the late 
Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, claiming humility as his motive. 
Nevertheless, he held control of the party's finances and 
military matters, thereby restricting the movement of the 
secretary general completely and turning himself in to the real 
decision maker. 
  3. Sayyid Nasrallah went to Iqlim al-Tuffah to lead 
Hizballah's fighters against the Amal Movement. He assumed an 
ultra-extremist position, and he showed so much enthusiasm for 
the fighting to continue that he refused to adhere to Ayatollah 
Khomeyni's unequivocal order, banning fellow Muslims from 
fighting each other. That turned him into a symbol of the 
resistance in the eyes of the party's elements who had strong 
feelings of hostility for the Amal Movement. In fact, Sayyid 
Nasrallah even traveled to Iran after the agreement between the 
party and the movement [to express] his objection to stopping 
the war between fellow Muslims. But his aim in going to Iran was 
to create some distance between himself and the media under the 
pretext of seeking knowledge in Qom, the center of learning. 
When he was in Iran, however, he tried to project the image of 
someone who was in full compliance with the wishes of officials, 
and he expressed his willingness to do everything that he was 
asked to do. When Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, may God have mercy on 
his soul, was killed by the criminal Zionists, everyone acted 
quickly so that Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah could be installed 
secretary general and Shaykh Na'im Qasim blocked from that 
position. Shaykh Na'im Qasim, who served as deputy secretary 
general during the lifetime of Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, is known 
for his affiliation with al-Da'wah Party. That is how Sayyid 
Hasan Nasrallah, a key figure in al-Da'wah Party, got to the 
position of secretary general of Hizballah. And yet, it was 
generally believed that al-Da'wah Party had actually been driven 
out of the primary decisionmaking position in Hizballah. 
  4. Sayyid Nasrallah vehemently attacked the Lebanese 
Maronite 
regime in his speeches, and he described it in the ugliest 
terms. He got many people to think that he was sincere when he 
disavowed the infidel regime, but then he would turn into an 
apologist for it and rationalize joining it. When he found no 
precedent in Shiite history to justify a person's public 
involvement with infidel entities and oppressive governments, he 
worked hard in the hope that he might get Ayatollah Khamene'i, 
may God protect him, to give him legal cover. When he failed to 
do that, he took one sentence from the leader's statement that 
dealt strictly with internal Iranian matters, and he published 
it in the center of the front page of AL-'AHD Newspaper. That 
sentence had nothing to do with the outside world, and it had 
nothing to do with the elections in Lebanon. Nasrallah published 
that sentence to let people believe that Iranian leaders, acting 
according to a fatwa [formal legal opinion] from Imam Khomeyni, 
may God sanctify his secret, had pushed him to join the Lebanese 
regime. Nasrallah then started making various charges against 
those who hesitated to go to the polling stations or those who 
did not vote for the candidates he had nominated. After bringing 
the matter to a [words indistinct] doing that by blatantly 
falsifying the facts right and left, Nasrallah started leaking 
information through his mouthpieces, indicating that no one had 
been legally commissioned by the Islamic leadership, but that 
the decision to participate had been made in the so-called Shura 
Council. 
  5. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah wants people to forget that he 
lied 
to them about the parliamentary elections. He wants them to 
forget that he forced Muslims to recognize the Lebanese regime 
when he became a member of that regime's legislative authority. 
Today, Nasrallah is venting his wrath against the government, 
loudly proclaiming that, "We will not let the blood of our 
martyrs be spilled in vain." According to our information, 
however, he is trying hard via numerous and different channels 
to get one of his followers accepted as a government minister. 
This would be the price for the blood of martyrs who died in 
Airport Square. This time too the rationale is reforming the 
situation from within. 
  We are reminding sincere believers who would not consent to 
abandoning the provisions of their true religion that the basis 
for disavowing infidel and oppressive governments is the same as 
that for prayer and fasting. We are reminding those sincere 
believers that the unequivocal verses from the Koran and the 
sayings which are attributed to the prophet, may God bless him 
and grant him salvation, and to the sacrosanct imams, peace be 
upon them, forbid dealings of any kind with non-Islamic 
entities. No person, not even the most erudite scholar, can make 
permissible what God Almighty and His messenger, may God bless 
him and grant him salvation, forbade. Accordingly, from now on, 
no true Muslim who is a member of Hizballah may obey his leaders 
so he can make money or protect a position, because by doing 
that, he would be obeying a creature and disobeying the Creator.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to available 
information, the security agencies in Sidon have apprehended a 
person who was wounded trying to throw an explosive charge at a 
shop in Darb al-Sim in eastern Sidon. A person helping him was 
killed in the explosion. 
  In the north, a person was caught in Tripoli and another was 
caught in Funaydiq in 'Akkar. Both are suspected of blowing up 
a shop in al-Zahriyah, Tripoli. The security agencies are 
interrogating the apprehended persons, 30 in all, mostly 
Lebanese and Palestinians. Contacts are under way with 
officials in the 'Ayn al-Hulwah Palestinian camp to hand over 
some suspects who are inside the camp. 
  Deputies who visited the president of the republic yesterday 
have cited him as saying that he has instructed the security 
agencies to step up efforts to uncover the circumstances 
surrounding recent explosions, particularly the blowing up of 
the Phalangist Party's central headquarters and the explosions 
that occurred in Tripoli. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Certain quarters are seeking to confuse the domestic 
Lebanese situation, particularly at the security level. The 
CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY cites informed sources as saying that an 
attempt to assassinate President Ilyas al-Hirawi a month ago has 
been uncovered. The security agencies arrested a number of 
suspects and they are being interrogated. 
  The security agencies apprehended a network in the north a 
few days ago. The network is suspected of engineering recent 
explosions in different areas; its members belong to extremist 
groups that seek to sow sedition by undermining stability. 
  The security agencies have also apprehended members of a 
network in the south, made up of extremist Palestinians who 
cooperate mostly with Lebanese elements with criminal records. 
They are being interrogated to discover any links between the 
various attempts to undermine stability, the latest of which was 
the explosion at the Phalangist Party's central headquarters.

  [Text] New information has surfaced about the attempt to 
assassinate President Ilyas al-Hirawi, the official denial of 
this attempt not withstanding. 
  Judge Riyad Tali' has issued an arrest warrant against Gh. 
T., formerly a security official in one of the militias, and two 
of his assistants, Sayid Sh. and Tony J. 
  The military authorities have also arrested a military man, 
Shirfan B., who plotted with the above suspects to assassinate 
President al-Hirawi when he was living in the temporary 
presidential residency in al-Ramlah al-Bayda' [in West Beirut]. 
  Shirfan, an officer candidate in the Lebanese Army, agreed 
to 
work for Gh. T. in return for a sum of money. He constantly 
submitted reports on the activity of the presidential office, 
the details of the president's office and bedroom, and the times 
when he was present in his office. He also gave information on 
the names of the officers and members of presidential guard. 
  Judicial sources said Shirfan and Tony confessed under 
interrogation that Tony introduced Shirfan to Gh. T. and 
conferred with him several times in Burj al-Fidar in Jubayl. 
Gh. T. explained to Shirfan how to place an explosive device in 
the president's office, either by booby-trapping the telephone 
or by putting the explosive device in a flower pot. Gh. T. 
promised Shirfan to give him a sum of money and to secure his 
travel to the United States.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Now there is another 
confrontation, in another era, with different methods. So far, 
the battle has not reached the level it had attained with the 
Italians, with rifles, bullets, and machine-guns. So far, the 
battle continues with the enemy, but with other weapons and 
other methods. We want to be very careful this time. We do not 
want the enemy to laugh at us. The enemy fears us. It says: 
This land has an armed and trained people, prepared for 
confrontation. It will bring us other methods. We must be 
careful about this. [Crowd chants slogans: "Hang them in the 
public square," "O leader, do not show mercy to any traitor"] 
  Yes, the enemy sometimes takes into consideration the fact 
that we are a people prepared to fight, prepared for armed 
resistance. Sometimes it avoids military confrontation, but it 
enters the battle with us in another way. We must be vigilant 
to this. [passage omitted] 
  We are a trained and armed people and more numerous in 
number. Our population is larger now than in the past. We have 
industry, agriculture, water, and potential. We can fight and 
continue the battle for a longer period. [passage omitted] 
  We are now in a situation as if we were fighting against 
America, so we are not importing American goods. We are doing 
without them. We are as if we were fighting against France and 
Britain, and we are not importing goods from Paris and London. 
Our independence, sovereignty, and honor are above goods. 
[passage omitted] 
  The traitor now is not just afraid of being referred to 
public prosecution and the court, he is afraid that his family 
and his house may be burned, and the masses may storm him. Who 
can prevent the masses, when on a night of anger they stampede 
into a farm, a house, two houses, or a whole quarter, and burn 
and destroy them? In fact, neither the police nor anyone crying 
out over a loudspeaker is going to stop a deluge. However much 
you shout, you cannot stop a deluge. The masses are like a 
deluge. [crowd chants] 
  There is no place for treachery now. One cannot say that 
those who have betrayed would be subject to the law and the 
court. No, there are the masses. All the Libyan tribes are 
determined to storm the house and property of a traitor, and to 
burn him and his family. The situation has become unbearable. 
In fact no one can prevent them. I regret that the situation 
should come to this, but those are the masses. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Ja'akah's [a Libyan national reported to have supplied 
evidence concerning the Lockerbie incident to the West] family 
were about to be cut to pieces in front of me. The masses said: 
Even if you provide guards for any traitorous family, we will 
storm the guards. We will regard them as protectors of 
treachery. 
  Confrontation is now in this manner. The Muslim brothers are 
treacherous; the Islamic Liberation Party is treacherous; 
al-Takfir wal Hijrah [Islamic movement in Egypt] is treacherous; 
the Da'wah, the Jihad, the Zandaqah, all these movements have 
foreign intelligence behind them. They are involved in 
smuggling; they deal in dollars, foreign exchange, consumer 
goods; they run after Western goods. All this is treason. If 
we were to face up to the enemy we must be at a high level of 
awareness, comprehension, and determination. We must know what 
weapons are required for the battle. 
  If hundreds of kilometers separate you from the enemy, I do 
not believe that one should get hold of a rifle or a revolver, 
aim at the enemy and shoot him, because there is a weapon that 
corresponds with a long distance. When you are face to face 
with the enemy, sometimes even the rifle is no good, and steel 
weapons are used. That is the best weapon in this case. One 
should know the right weapon needed for close combat. We must 
know the right weapon for the battle now raging between us and 
the West so that we may defeat the enemy. If the enemy is 
shooting at you with a machine-gun and you have a revolver, then 
that is not it. The machine-gun has a range that a revolver 
cannot reach. You would not be able to touch the enemy, who 
would defeat you.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer Tatyana Khudobina] There is a New Year 
surprise for Vesti viewers in the next report, about the Alpha 
special troops unit. It turns out that these are the same kind 
of people as us, with the same cares and worries. 
  There is much more rumor than reliable information about the 
Alpha unit. The unknown is always more frightening. In August 
1991 Alpha was supposed to storm the White House, but did not do 
so. The slogan -- "Hurrah for the Alpha Lieutenants" -- 
appeared on the Moskva hotel and other buildings. 
  In October 1993 Alpha did take part in storming the Supreme 
Soviet, which was armed to the teeth, and without firing a 
single shot. The words -- "Alpha's coming" -- were enough to 
make the gunmen drop their weapons. So who are these super 
warriors? 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Z. Gindeleyev] The Alpha 
anti-terrorist group: a unique military unit and the only one in 
the country whose profession is to stop acts of terror. The 
unit has dozens of successful operations under its belt, 
including the release of hostages from remand cells in Sukhumi, 
and from aircraft seized in Tbilisi, Sarapul, Ufa, and Tashkent. 
They disarmed the Serov gang in Yerevan and the (?Levshiyants) 
band of criminals. 
  The recent successful operation to free the Rostov 
schoolboys 
was largely due to the professional skill and patience of Alpha 
members. 
  The first interview with the commanding officer of Alpha in 
the entire history of the unit has been given to the Vesti 
program. 
  [G. Zaytsev, Alpha commander; identified by caption] 
Analysis 
of the crime situation in the country, including the operation 
in Mineralnyye Vody, leads to this conclusion: We cannot expect 
the level of terrorism to fall. On the contrary, incidences of 
not only criminal but also political terror are on the rise and 
we must be ready for this. I think that an integrated 
anti-terrorism system should be formed and that it should be 
directed and coordinated from a single center. 
  [Gindeleyev] Hero of the Soviet Union Maj-Gen Zaytsev, who 
has accounted for 14 terrorists, is worried about the safety of 
Russian citizens, although the future of Alpha itself is not 
clear during the current reform of the country's security 
agencies. [end recording]

  [Text] Sofia, December 30 (BTA) -- The Ministry of the 
Interior tonight denied a story in the TEMPO magazine of Ankara, 
alleging that members of a Kurdish terrorist organization were 
based in Bulgaria. 
  "The Ministries of Bulgaria and Turkey have signed a 
cooperation agreement and exchange information on the combatting 
of terrorism," says a press release of the Interior Ministry 
received at BTA. It stresses that Bulgaria's special services 
have no information on the existence of such an organization in 
this country and have not exchanged information on the matter 
with Turkey. "What the magazine says about there being a link 
between a Kurdish terrorist organization and Iranian drug 
traffickers could be described only as a journalist's 
interpretation unsupported by facts and evidence," the press 
release also says. The story in TEMPO, commented in most big 
Bulgarian dailies today, says the Bulgarian special services 
have found out that PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members 
have penetrated into Bulgaria after some West European countries 
outlawed them. The story alleges that the PKK was connected 
with one Iraqi and two Iranian drug runners, discovered in a 
recent police check in a Sofia flat, in which one policeman was 
killed. Indeed one police officer was killed on December 6, and 
another died from his wounds in hospital later on, but the 
Bulgarian police reported they had been shot by Iranian drug 
traffickers, shot dead by the police as they resisted arrest. 
  The Interior Ministry also stated it had no information on 
the existence of a Bulgarian-Greek ring which, according to 
ELLADHA SIMERA of Greece, illegally transfers foreign currency. 
Allegedly, it operates through gambling casinos in Bulgaria and 
is connected with senior government officials. "The Interior 
Ministries of Bulgaria and Greece have signed an agreement which 
includes exchange of operative information, so far, however, 
there has been neither information nor inquiries about the 
activities of such a group," says the ministry's press release.

<F P=106> [Report by Mehmet Salih Ceviker] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt -- There are indications that the Idealist 
[Turkish right-wing organization affiliated with the Grey Wolves 
of Alparslan Turkes] mafia in Germany is getting ready to attack 
the Kurdish mafia. 
  A source that once was a member of MHP's [National Movement 
Party] European organization said that the attacks will be 
"directed against prominent Kurds in the narcotics business." 
The attacks are being organized from Germany. 
  There are indications that Kurdish businessmen, who have 
considerable control over the narcotics business in Frankfurt, 
are the primary targets. It was also reported that operations 
are also planned against the Kurdish businessmen and PKK 
[Kurdish Workers Party] leaders in other cities. 
  It is being said that MHP leader Alparslan Turkes has moved 
to activate the Turkish Federation, which is MHP's side 
organization in Europe. It is being said that Turkes has issued 
the following instruction: "We started the operation in Turkey. 
Now, it is the time to act in Europe. We will definitely go 
into action." 
  In recent years, the Turkish Federation has been rapidly 
losing ground. The grassroots of the Turkish Federation has 
been to a great extent taken over and organized by other extreme 
right-wing organizations. There are indications that "dergahs" 
[courts] organized abroad by a team operating under Muhsin 
Yazicioglu, leader of Grand Unity Party [BBP], have gathered 
most MHP members around them. 
<H5>  Turkes Was in Frankfurt on 25 December </H5>
  It is being reported that during his visit to Germany on 
25-26 December, Turkes held a number of meetings. It is being 
said that Turkes was introduced to people to be used in the 
operations, and that he even said the following to these people: 
"The Turkish people need you and your experience. Trust in the 
Federation and make your preparations." 
  There are indications that after many years, the Turkish 
Federation has started to gather "fanatic and arms-carrying" 
militants. It is being reported that these people are constantly 
subjected to the propaganda that "the Kurds are collecting 
protection money from the Turks, that is, from people close to 
us. How long could we remain spectators to this?" and that they 
have been given certain names as their targets. It was learned 
that they have particularly targeted the Kurdish mafia 
godfathers, a certain Huseyin and a certain Erdal in Frankfurt. 
  In the meantime, efforts are under way to "improve 
relations" 
between MIT [Turkish National Intelligence Organization] and the 
Turkish Federation for this operation. It is being reported 
that Turkes, who established excellent relations with MIT in 
Turkey, particularly recently, is trying to forge a 
rapprochement between MIT and his diaspora organization, which 
had been cool towards MIT because some of its members were 
tortured during the 12 September coup. 
<H5>  The Aim is To Establish a Monopoly in Narcotics </H5>
  It is being said that the reason for the MHP's ordering its 
grass roots to attack Kurds in Europe is to take revenge on the 
PKK members for preventing the Turkish Federation from 
organizing a cultural night in Vienna a few months ago and for 
beating up the MHP members in public. In this way, it is aimed 
at reviving the activities of the Turkish Federation and 
replenishing its funds. 
  A source closely watching the narcotics mafia made the 
following assessment: "The problem has totally to do with 
money. The aim is to eradicate the Kurdish mafia which has 
taken over the narcotics market, and thus revive the Idealist 
mafia. Frankfurt has been chosen as the center for this 
operation. It is mainly the Kurdish mafia that controls the 
narcotics business in Frankfurt and hence the Kurdish mafia is 
getting most of the protection money. The MHP members are very 
uneasy with this situation. They are angry that protection 
money is collected from their own people. They want to 
rechannel the financial resources to their own organization. 
This is because the Turkish Federation has no income of its 
own."

<F P=106> [Report by M. Salih Ceviker] </F>
  [Excerpts] Frankfurt -- It has been learned that Alparslan 
Turkes, leader of MHP [Nationalist Movement Party], met with the 
national taekwondo team member Kenan Aygun -- whom the 
Counterguerrilla uses to commit assassinations -- in Frankfurt 
on 25 December, last Saturday. It is being claimed that Turkes 
asked Aygun to carry out assignments to be given by MHP's 
organization abroad. [passage omitted] 
  The [north] Cyprus press had carried reports to the effect 
that Aygun, who met Turkes at the Frankfurt headquarters of the 
Turkish Federation last Saturday, was working in affiliation 
with the [northern] Cyprus's Taekwondo Federation, which is 
under Counterguerrilla control, and that he was involved in 
various murders and stabbings. 
  Aygun had told the newspaper KIBRIS, owned by Asil Nadir, 
that the Directorate of [north] Cyprus Civilian Affairs 
Department, which is known to be the headquarters of the 
Counterguerrilla in Cyprus, had asked him to abduct a Turkish 
officer held in prison on the Greek Cypriot side. 
  YENIDUZEN quoted Aygun, who is reportedly a member of the 
inner circle of Nadir's bodyguards, as saying that MIT [Turkish 
Intelligence Organization] interfered in the 1991 elections in 
northern Cyprus and that the Commander of the Cyprus Peace 
Forces General Ali Yalcin had sent a threatening letter to the 
leftist [Turkish] Cypriots asking them to support the National 
Unity Party. 
  It was learned that Aygun, who was expelled from Cyprus, was 
beaten up and gravely injured in Germany for his revelations. 
It was reported that the attack took place in Frankfurt's 
Galluswarte quarter on 6 October 1992. It was learned that 
Aygun, who was hit on the head with an iron bar and sustained 
knife wounds to his forehead and abdomen, was taken to hospital 
by police. Noting that the attackers also searched Aygun's 
home, the police officers said that the attack was designed not 
to kill him but warn him.

<F P=106> ["Text" of exclusive interview with German Foreign Minister </F>
Klaus Kinkel by MILLIYET correspondent Regaip Minareci in Bonn; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn--[Minareci] Germany was the first country 
to describe the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] as a terrorist 
organization and ban its activities. Meanwhile, it has 
encouraged several countries in Europe to close down the Kurdish 
organizations in them. A widespread view behind the political 
scenes in Turkey is that Germany expects Turkey to reciprocate. 
  [Kinkel] No, expecting something in return from Turkey is 
out 
of the question. I have always wanted to have the PKK 
activities banned. I am glad that that has been done now. The 
legal requirements for and the possible outcome of the banning 
of associations in Germany, which is governed on the basis of a 
liberal constitution, have to be debated in detail. That is 
essential. The significant wave of agitation throughout Germany 
on 4 November should have convinced everyone that remaining 
inactive against the militant Kurdish groups, which wanted to 
achieve their objective through violence, was no longer 
possible. They posed a threat to Germany's security and public 
order. They also posed a threat to peaceful coexistence in 
Germany. We cannot allow the internal disputes in Turkey to be 
transferred to our country. Nor do we wish to allow that to 
happen. We respect the rights of the Turkish citizens in 
Germany. However, we must not be expected to adopt an 
understanding approach on acts of violence. [passage omitted] 
  [Minareci] How does Germany plan to prevent the PKK from 
violating the ban and establishing new organizations under 
different names? Can you comment on how the PKK will behave in 
Germany in the future? What are the measures the German 
Government plans to put into effect against possible PKK attacks 
in the future? 
  [Kinkel] The Federal Internal Affairs Minister's decision 
not 
only bans the PKK and the 34 organizations affiliated with it 
but also prohibits any move to establish new organizations to 
replace them. Naturally, the police and the judicial organs 
will see to it that the ban is imposed within the framework of 
the laws. They will bring criminal charges against anyone who 
violates Germany's laws. 
  [Minareci] While the European Union [EU] members have moved 
to cooperate against the PKK, Greece has openly supported that 
terrorist organization. Will Germany hold talks with Greece on 
that matter? 
  [Kinkel] The PKK problem has not affected all the EU members 
as much as it has affected Germany. However, all the EU 
countries agree on the need to condemn terrorism and wage a 
determined struggle against it. In view of that, Germany is 
acting together with all the other EU members in a coordinated 
way. We hope to establish closer cooperation on the matter. 
  [Minareci] In addition to the PKK, other terrorist groups 
and 
individuals have used Germany as their headquarters, such as 
Dev-Yol [Revolutionary Path Organization] and Cemalettin Kaplan 
[Islamic fundamentalist leader]. Will Germany take measures 
against them as well or will they find an opportunity to 
strengthen their ranks? 
  [Kinkel] The ban on associations is not the only effective 
measure that can be taken in the struggle against terrorist 
activities. Germany is a lawful state which can use various 
means to wage a struggle against anyone who resorts to acts of 
violence and disrupts law and order and peace. The Dev-Sol 
[Revolutionary Left Organization] was banned in Germany in 1983. 
The PKK has been banned recently. The pertinent federal state 
has taken measures against Cemalettin Kaplan within the 
framework of the law on foreigners. I suggest that matters 
concerning the two countries should not be viewed from the point 
of view of the adoption of forceful measures. Political 
arguments and debates have gained importance in our time, more 
so than before. They must be based on the friendship between

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 3 (AFP) -- The body of a Bosnian 
general shot dead was found in a car park along the main highway 
between Liege in eastern Belgium and the German border town of 
Aachen, legal sources disclosed here Monday [3 January]. 
  They said two Romanian hitchhikers found the corpse of Yusuf 
Prazina at Walhorn overnight Friday. Prazina, 30, who had been 
in the fighting in Sarajevo, settled in Liege last August. He 
was missing early last month, the sources said. 
  Belgian public service radio said Prazina, regarded as a 
moderate, had deserted and taken refuge in Belgium. He often 
went about armed and accompanied by bodyguards who were his 
former soldiers. 
  The radio said he disappeared with three of them on December 
3. It said the bullets to his head matched the calibre of the 
weapon of one of the bodyguards and that the general was killed 
some three weeks ago.

  [Text] Zagreb, Jan 5 (AFP) -- A special Bosnian Army unit 
headed by Bakir Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president's son, 
murdered a Bosnian general found shot to death in Belgium last 
week, a Croatian newspaper reported Wednesday [5 January] citing 
well-informed sources. 
  The VJESNIK newspaper, controlled by the government, said 
the 
assassination of Yusuf Prazina was carried out by five members 
of a commando unit called "Delta" and headed by Ismet Bajramovic 
also known as Celo. 
  The paper said that three members of the Syrian-backed 
Palestinian movement Saika [al-Sa'iqah] had Prazina under 
surveillance for three weeks before one of them, acting as an 
arms dealer, lured him into a trap in a car park along the main 
highway between Liege in eastern Belgium and the German border 
town of Aachen. 
  Prazina, 30, nicknamed Yuka, was missing early last month. 
He was found Saturday with two bullet holes in the head. 
  "The necessary logistical means to carry out the operation 
were provided by Bakir Izetbegovic, son of Alija Izetbegovic, 
who left Sarajevo more than six months ago," VJESNIK said. 
  It added that Bakir Izetbegovic "often travels between 
Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Baghdad, Tehran and Ankara, by using 
Iraqi and Pakistani passports" and was in Belgium at the time of 
the assassination. 
  Hasan Cengic, head of logistics for the army in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, was "personally involved in the 
assassination of Yuka Prazina," the paper said. 
  "The day after the murder, those responsible fled via 
Brussels and Paris to Cairo and then Khartoum. Bakir 
Izetbegovic went to Baghdad and Hasan Cengic, according to 
reliable information, went to Islamabad by using a fake 
Pakistani passport," VJESNIK said. 
  Prazina, who had fought in Sarajevo and later in Mostar, 
settled in Liege last August. He once headed Moslem troops on 
Mount Igman overlooking Sarajevo and was praised for his defence 
of the city in 1992. 
  But he later fell out with the Bosnian high command, was 
termed a traitor and fled in the spring of 1993 to Herzegovina 
where he joined rival HVO Bosnian Croat forces.

  [Text] Eisenstadt -- The state police are investigating the 
discovery of explosives at the Hungarian border at 
Heiligenkreuz. On 30 December a Serb carrying 1.5 kg of 
explosives with fuses and detonators wanted to enter Austria. 
The explosives were hidden in a traveling bag in the baggage 
compartment of the bus that he was driving. The driver and 
owner of the vehicle, who operates a bus line between Belgrade 
and Switzerland, was not transporting any passengers. During 
the interrogation, he pretended not to know anything: He said 
that he was unaware of the explosives. The bag was to be handed 
over to somebody in Switzerland. 
  The Serb was arrested. The purpose of the explosives was 
still unclear on Monday [3 January]. It is not known whether 
the material was to be sold for profit or used for attacks. 
  A link with the bomb threat against [Vienna's] Schwechat 
Airport on New Year's Eve has been ruled out. It has only been 
confirmed that the explosive found after the double murder of 
the German border policemen on the "Danube Courier" train was of 
the same "type."

<F P=106> [Report signed J.F.D.: "Arms Arsenal Found in Brussels"] </F>
  [Text] A weapons arsenal, inlcuding various rocket 
launchers, grenades, rifles, and explosives was discovered on 
Monday [3 January] by the BSR [Special Investigation Brigade] in 
a Brussels garage. The seizure was the result of a long 
investigation of acquaintances of Murat Kaplan, a major Belgian 
criminal, who is now behind bars and who, as is well-known, 
escaped from Saint-Gilles prison on 3 May 1993. He fled with 
the help of two accomplices: Patrick Haemers [Belgian criminal], 
who was recaptured first, and Basri Bajrami, who is still on the 
run. Murat Kaplan was recaptured in Zellik on 15 May. 
  The discovery of this arsenal, which was made possible 
because of the close surveillance of Kaplan's girlfriend, 
clearly shows that the 31-year-old Kaplan, who is of Albanian 
origin, heads a well-organized gang. Did his "friends" hope to 
use the arms in support of Kaplan's umpteenth escape from 
prison? Kaplan is nicknamed the "prince of escapes." 
  Kaplan is no longer the gentleman burglar, which he had been 
for some time. He is one of Belgium's most notorious criminals. 
The arms discovered supposedly were used during an attack on 
the Laeken police station, as a reprisal for the the arrest of 
Philippe Lacroix. At the time of the attack, Kaplan had not 
been captured.

  [Text] Cologne [no date as received] (DPA) -- Heribert 
Hellenbroich, former president of the Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution [Bundesverfassungsschutz], views the letter 
claiming responsibility [for the death of Christian Democratic 
Union politician Bernhard Saelzer] as "a bad joke perpetrated by 
amateurs." [see item LD3012171493 in previous Terrorism Report] 
He told Friday's edition of the Cologne daily EXPRESS that the 
writers had made three decisive mistakes which had unmasked 
them: "First, the letter is very different from the confused 
linguistic style of the Red Army Faction [RAF]. Second, real 
terrorists would never claim to have tampered with the victim's 
car. They act professionally and do not talk about it. And 
third, they look for symbolic figures for their attacks. Mr. 
Saelzer was neither well known nor powerful enough to be a 
target for terrorists."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "'Ndrangheta Informant Warns of </F>
Explosives"] 
  [Text] Reggio Calabria, 6 Jan (ANSA) -- Police in the 
Calabrian capital were searching for 350 kg of explosives that a 
'Ndrangheta [Calabrian Mafia-style organization] informant had 
warned them were going to be used in an attack on a Reggio 
magistrate. 
  That search was concentrated today in an area near the 
Ionian 
coast about 30 km from the capital, investigators said. 
  A likely target of the reported plan was Giuseppe Verzera, 
assistant district prosecutor of Reggio, who has conducted some 
of the most important inquiries into organized crime in that 
region. 
  Police said they had obtained the information from several 
members of 'Ndrangheta gangs who had decided to cooperate with 
the authorities, including one informant who only recently began 
to talk to police. 
  This source told investigators that the explosive (of the 
same type used in deadly car bombs that blew up in Florence, 
Milan and Rome last spring and summer) was in the hands of the 
Calabrian crime organization as well as how they intended to 
employ it. 
  In a search last July, carabinieri found 50 kg of explosives 
hidden in a field near Montebello Ionico, an area considered to 
be under the control of the Iamonte clan. That crime group was 
recently badly hit in a major dragnet on December 6, under the 
coordination of Verzera. 
  The growing role of the 'Ndrangheta in national organized 
crime circuits, both alone and in cooperation with the Sicilian 
mafia was underlined in a report on crime filed by the Anti 
Mafia Investigating Directorate (DIA) to parliament yesterday. 
  The national anti-crime police unit said that the Calabrian 
'Ndrangheta has been expanding rapidly since 1991, when Sicilian 
Cosa Nostra representatives intervened among warring Calabrian 
rings to negotiate a `pax mafiosa' that led to a steep decline 
in inter-clan murders and a much improved capacity for illicit 
business. 
  (DIA cited the 20 percent in Calabria's gangland killings in 
1992, with inter-gang deaths continuing to fall this year.) 
  Investigators linked the 'Ndrangheta's spread to the tight 
network of secret masonic lodges in the region of Calabria, 
first brought to the attention of law enforcement officials by 
the Palmi public prosecutor's office, then under the direction 
of Judge Agostino Cordova. One third of all southern Freemasons 
live in Calabria, investigators estimate, and they are stepping 
up their inquiries into the links between criminal activity and 
the secret and semi-secret lodges. 
  In the province of Reggio Calabria alone, some 3,500 persons 
have been identified as 'Ndrangheta members, while the whole 
region numbers 155 clans and at least 5,500 working for 
organized crime. Catanzaro and Cosenza were cited as other major 
crime centers. 
  'Ndrangheta activities include extortion (with 368 related 
cases of arson in 1992), usury, kidnapping and drug traffic. The 
DIA report cites the spread of Calabrian crime activities to 
Northern Italy as well as abroad to Canada, the U.S. and 
Australia. 
  In the past six months, 890 detentions or arrests have been 
ordered, including 524 regarding the 'Ndrangheta, as compared to 
269 orders regarding the Sicilian mafia, 62 involving the Sacra 
Corona Unita [United Holy Crown -- Pugliese Mafia-style 
organization] of Puglia and 35 involving the Camorra.

<F P=106> [Article by Taha Akyol: "The Hammer Force"] </F>
  [Text] Ankara is worried by several reports from northern 
Iraq because they indicate that the Kurds will soon be involved 
in clashes among themselves. 
  1. Hizballah members have attacked and killed 10 of 
Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani's 
supporters. What has drawn attention is that the Hizballah 
attacks began after Mas'ud Barzani condemned the Kurdish Workers 
Party [PKK]. 
  2. The Hizballah movement in northern Iraq is still a weak 
organization, but it is gradually gaining strength. Ethem 
Barzani, who is a member of the Barzan tribe, is one of the 
important members of the Hizballah. 
  3. The socialist group headed by Rasul Mahmud is gradually 
becoming militant in nature. That group has been clashing with 
Mas'ud Barzani's men. 
  4. Mas'ud Barzani's relations with Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani have deteriorated. It is 
difficult to predict how effective the chairmanship council that 
Barzani and Talabani have established to prevent clashes between 
the two sides will be. 
  The question at the present time is as follows: How will the 
maintenance or the withdrawal of the Hammer Force affect the 
present situation in northern Iraq? 
  Siyamet Muzuri, one of the Hizballah leaders in northern 
Iraq, on 29 May told MILLIYET correspondent Namik Durukan the 
following: "The day when we shall take control of northern Iraq 
is very near. Our relations with the federal government are not 
favorable at the present time. That is because the government 
members prefer the secular system, as is the case in Turkey." 
  Muzuri openly praised Iran and said that "Ayatollah Khomeyni 
taught us our objectives." 
  The radical groups in northern Iraq are gradually becoming 
more and more aggressive. Furthermore, they seem to be inclined 
toward establishing a front against Mas'ud Barzani. That front 
will also include the PKK. Meanwhile, Talabani continues to be 
an unreliable leader. 
  Obviously, the armed radical organizations will become more 
effective if instability worsens as a result of confusion or 
civil war in northern Iraq. Consequently, there will be a 
gradual increase in the forces interfering in the developments 
in that region. Obviously, the Hizballah groups and the PKK, by 
nature, are eager to have such a situation prevail in northern 
Iraq. 
  It is a fact that the Hammer Force safeguards northern Iraq 
against Saddam Husayn's regime in Baghdad. However, that force 
also helps the "moderate" Barzani-Talabani administration 
maintain a relatively stable situation in that region. 
Naturally, as far as Turkey is concerned, Barzani is a more 
important leader. 
  The reason why the PKK and the Hizballah groups in northern 
Iraq are opposed to the Hammer Force is as follows: They want 
instability to worsen and a wave of confusion or internal war to 
sweep through the region so they can become more effective. In 
fact, they may even cooperate with Saddam Husayn in order to 
achieve their objectives. 
  The destabilization in northern Iraq may result in armed 
activities and create a new wave of refugees. That state of 
affairs would disturb Turkey. 
  There is no evidence that the Hammer Force supports the PKK. 
It must be pointed out that Turkish officers fly in the Hammer 
Force aircraft that patrol the region. In fact, President 
Demirel has said that the Hammer Force has been helpful to 
Turkey by providing information for the operations the security 
forces carry out in the region. 
  We wish that there was no justification for the presence of 
the Hammer Force in Turkey. However, high-ranking officials in 
Ankara regard that force as an essential factor because it is 
keeping the instability in northern Iraq from becoming worse. 
Furthermore, they believe that it is a "trump card" which 
Turkey can use.

  [Text] Ankara--Recent speculation that, under pressure from 
Damascus, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is gearing 
up to move its headquarters from Syria to Armenia, is suspected 
in Turkey of being disinformation to ease Turkey's own pressure 
on that country to deal with the terrorists. 
  Unconfirmed reports, coming from Middle East sources, have 
it 
that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has felt the Syrian grip on his 
organization tightening up and is now seeking a better base for 
the movement. 
  Through his own contacts with Armenians in Syria and 
Lebanon, 
sources claimed, Ocalan is currently making arrangements to base 
the PKK in Kurdish area of Armenia where the organization has 
increasing mass support. 
  Observers here suspect that such reports aim at putting 
Turkey's policy with regard to Syria off track and forcing it to 
ease its pressure on the PKK. 
  Recently, Turkish officials signed a security protocol with 
the Syrians, accepting the exchange of terrorists and the 
extradition of draft dodgers. A majority of PKK militants are 
known to be draft evaders. Syria also guaranteed it would not 
allow terrorist organizations to use its territories. Turkey 
observes a complete embargo on Armenia and has no diplomatic 
ties with the country. Turkish contacts with Armenia only take 
place on a multilateral level and are limited to such things as 
the Black Sea Economic Cooperation scheme, CSCE and the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council. 
  With Syria, however, Turkey has strong bilateral ties and 
there is considerable U.S. pressure on that country as well. 
Official sources in Ankara suspect that the message given via 
speculation on the PKK leadership's intention to move is that if 
Syria is further pressurized, Turkey may lose any indirect 
control it has on this organization. 
  In other words, the message could be that if Turkish 
pressure 
goes too far and the Syrians get more disturbed over Ankara's 
tightening grip, it could send the PKK off to a country where it 
will flourish freely. If the PKK is based in Armenia, it would 
be literally impossible to prevent its organizational activities 
there with the lack of diplomatic contact. 
  Meanwhile, security sources on Tuesday denied a report which 
appeared as a banner story in the Turkish daily HURRIYET and 
said there had been no contact between the National Intelligence 
Organization (MIT) and the Syrian secret service, Mukhabarat. 
  HURRIYET claimed in its report that two MIT officers had 
secretly travelled to Damascus last week and were taken to the 
house where PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan lived. The report said 
the agents saw someone in the garden who "looked like" Ocalan 
but could not be sure. It also noted that it was not clear 
whether the PKK leader was under custody or only protected very 
closely. The Syrians reportedly claimed he was detained. An 
intelligence source, who asked not to be identified, told the 
TURKISH DAILY NEWS that no one from MIT had visited Syria 
recently for the said purpose. He said "the scenario" described 
in the paper was not possible "since such relations do not exist 
between our service and theirs."

<F P=106> [Report by Gorsel Polat: "PKK Will Attack With ASALA in the </F>
Spring"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been reported that the Kurdish 
Workers Party [PKK] members, who train in several camps in 
Armenia, and ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of 
Armenia] militants will carry out joint operations against 
Turkey through Armenia's border in the spring. 
  The General Directorate of Police has compiled a file on 
"PKK 
activities in Armenia." A document in the file said that the 
PKK established its camps around villages close to Turkey's 
border, villages that are mostly inhabited by Kurdish citizens 
and Armenians who are hostile to the Turkish people. 
  The file said that the PKK members are training with the 
ASALA militants in al-Biqa' valley in Lebanon and the Zeli camp 
in northern Iraq. Regarding PKK's links with the Armenians, it 
said: 
  1. The terrorist ASALA militants have trained the PKK 
members in the PKK camps in Jordan [as published] and Syria, 
recruited new members for that organization, and supplied arms 
and other required material to them. ASALA continues to support 
the PKK at the present time. 
  2. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is supported by Armenia and 
ASALA. He personally supervises PKK's links with Armenia. 
Ocalan has established training camps near Armenian villages 
close to Turkey's border. His militants train in those camps at 
the present time. The Armenian Government is aware of PKK 
activities and it supports them. PKK's training camps are 
located around villages close to Turkey's border, which are 
mostly inhabited by Kurdish citizens and Armenians who are 
hostile to the Turkish people. 
  3. It is believed that the PKK members and ASALA militants, 
who train in those camps, will attack Turkey through Armenia's 
border in the near future (beginning in spring 1994). 
  The file noted that the Armenian Government is aware of the 
support given to that organization in Armenia. It listed the 
Armenian villages that help the PKK as follows: Mirek, Ria 
Taza, Elegis, Shengavit, Derek, Afsin, Suphan, Chumyshvan, and 
Senger in Aragats district; Baradzh, Hakko, Gelto, Sorik, 
Kabaktapa, Tellik, and Sechanly in Amri Taze, Talin district; 
Ferik in Baysyz Echmiadzin district, and Samiran in Ashtarak 
district.

  [Text] Ankara--Despite official statements that the 
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) received a major blow in 
1993, official figures show a twofold increase in terrorist 
activities during the first 11 months of the year in comparison 
to the same period in 1992. 
  According to official figures provided by Turkish security 
sources and the Interior Ministry, the number of civilians 
killed this year increased by 100 percent compared to last 
year's statistics. 
  Official data shows that in all of 1992 there were 1,920 
PKK-related incidents throughout Turkey while this figure 
reached 3,901 in only the first 11 months of this year. 
Meanwhile, the civilian death toll was recorded at 1,249 as of 
November 30, 1993, representing an increase of about 100 percent 
from 1992's year-end figure of 618. 
  During the same period in 1993, a total of 676 security 
officials, including temporary village guards, soldiers and 
policemen, were killed. Last year, this figure stood at 634. 
Official figures, provided in writing to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS, 
revealed an increase in PKK casualties and injuries in 1993 with 
1,552 terrorists killed and 121 wounded, in contrast to last 
year's figures of 1,228 killed and 52 wounded. 
  However, the number of alleged terrorists caught by security 
forces so far in 1993 was 7,640 lower than the 7,908 terrorists 
caught in 1992. 
  While 853 civilians were wounded in 1992, the figure rose to 
1,389 in 1993. The number of wounded security personnel also 
increased in this year's figures. 
  During the first 11 months of 1993, security forces 
confiscated 3,028 long-range rifles, 1,221 guns, 2,164 bombs and 
463,378 bullets. In all of 1992, security forces had managed to 
seize 3,109 long-range rifles, 1,290 guns, 2,368 bombs and 
352,959 bullets.

<F P=106> [First part of a two-part interview with President Suleyman </F>
Demirel by Hasan Yalcin in Ankara; date not given--Bureau does 
not plan to process the second part of the interview a review of 
which revealed no fileworthy material] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Yalcin] Looking at the Middle 
East, are we seeing a change in the essence of the relations 
among Turkey, Iran, and Syria or is this a simple improvement in 
ordinary relations? There have been reports of late that joint 
operations could be undertaken in Iran and Iraq and that signs 
in this direction are being observed. Was this a qualitative 
jump? 
  [Demirel] There is some information to the effect that the 
PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] has settled in Iran. These were 
rumors for a while and Iran rejected them. Later, the situation 
was explained to Iran. Incidents that might have happened over 
there would have concerned them. Upon that, a major 
rapprochement took place. I held a long conversation with 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Tehran last year. I also held a long 
conversation with him when he visited Istanbul for the ECO 
[Economic Cooperation Organization] meeting. Our foreign 
minister went to Iran and their's came here. All these things 
are good, but there is also an agreement that goes back to 1932. 
If they [the PKK] are there, let us launch an operation against 
them. We have reached the point of joint operation. 
  [Yalcin] Is this, that is, the joint operation, something 
for 
the coming months? 
  [Demirel] But an improvement is obvious. [reply as 
published] 
  [Yalcin] What about the last three visits? 
  [Demirel] These were scheduled visits. Their foreign 
minister could come at any time. First Vice President Habibi 
had to pay a return visit for my visit, but it was then 
postponed following the assassination of Ugur Mumcu. It was 
said that the Iranians were behind it, which upset them. 
  [Yalcin] I will ask a question concerning the PKK. For the 
last 10 years there have been promises to the effect that this 
problem would be eradicated. You too expressed similar views. 
Has there been a tragic turn to the events now? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Demirel] No matter which government comes to power it has 
to 
show the same determination that the 49th government headed by 
me and the present 50th government have shown. Any other 
government cannot be the government of this state. 
  [Yalcin] New forces and measures are being introduced. Are 
these the foundation of this determination? 
  [Demirel] These are security measures. There is no political 
aspect to it. 
  [Yalcin] You made a statement on local elections. Could you 
clarify it? You said that the PKK candidates will be prevented 
from running. What is the legal way to prevent it? That is, 
how are you going to do that? 
  [Demirel] Could a PKK candidate run in an election? 
  [Yalcin] How are you going to weed out such people since 
their being PKK is not written on them? 
  [Demirel] What I want to say is this: If a PKK member runs 
in these elections and wins it would be tantamount to a 
plebiscite. The PKK is a criminal organization, a terrorist 
group. Could a state, while struggling against the criminal and 
terrorist group, also allow its members to run in the elections? 
When the time comes, measures against it will be thought out. 
  [Yalcin] Is there a legal measure before the start of the 
elections? 
  [Demirel] No, there is no legal way to sift out such people 
before the elections. But if a candidate says "I am a PKK 
member," or is engaged in such propaganda, then the state will 
take care of it. Could a state ever allow members of a crime 
syndicate to run in elections? Could the state forces, which 
pursue the bandits in the mountains, allow the members of that 
bandit group to come down to the cities and run in elections? 
  [Yalcin] There might be legal measures if the state knows 
these people. 
  [Demirel] It knows, it knows. The state knows everything. 
Of course there is also the following case: The elections 
cannot be presented as a plebiscite if a candidate has not 
entered the elections in the name of the PKK and has not openly 
declared himself affiliated to it but later announces that he is 
a PKK member. 
  [Yalcin] Simply because he has not stated this at the 
beginning? 
  [Demirel] This is not possible by merely stating that 
elections were tantamount to a plebiscite. [passage omitted] 
  [Yalcin] When we were still publishing the magazine 2000 
IKIBIN'E DOGRU, I asked you. I then conveyed to you fresh 
reports, and at the time you told me that such organizations are 
illegal and that you are opposed to such things. You are now 
the head of state and an influential organization is active over 
there. I am talking about Hizballah, which is based in the east 
and southeast. What can you say on this issue? 
  [Demirel] The state is closely watching this organization. 
The state cannot make concessions to illegal activities. There 
cannot be a state where some enjoy the right to commit lawless 
acts and some are charged with criminal offenses if they act 
lawlessly. We are watching them very closely. 
  [Yalcin] You might have heard, but it is being said that the 
state is making use of Hizballah to balance out the PKK. 
  [Demirel] Such a claim is wrong. 
  [Yalcin] But there have been many complaints in this 
direction in Batman. 
  [Demirel] There is no such case. 
  [Yalcin] There are hundreds of unsolved murders in Batman. 
  [Demirel] Unfortunately, all these are interconnected. I am 
following the case of unsolved crimes very closely. 
  [Yalcin] Are you satisfied with the things that are being 
done to solve these problems? You are at the helm of the state 
and yet such things are taking place in the country you run. 
  [Demirel] It would be very wrong if I were to say that I am 
not concerned about what is happening in Turkey. I am very 
concerned. But since the state has no other alternative than its 
present course of action, then it should do what it is already 
doing but do it better and get results. I am telling you openly 
that in my former capacity as prime minister and in my present 
capacity as the head of the National Security Council I told all 
the state organs that the unsolved crimes should be solved. 
Otherwise, there will be an inclination to blame them on the 
state. I am following this problem very closely. It is being 
tackled in a positive manner.

<F P=106> [Report by Hikmet Cicek] </F>
  [Text] Ankara -- It has been learned that the Syrian 
authorities have rejected a request from Jalal Talabani, leader 
of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], and Kemal Burkay, 
secretary-general of the Kurdistan Socialist Party [PSK], for a 
meeting with the leader of the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] 
Abdullah Ocalan. 
  According to the available information, Talabani and Burkay 
went to the Syrian capital Damascus last week to meet Ocalan. 
It was said that Talabani and Burkay were going to propose to 
Ocalan to declare a cease-fire on the eve of the local elections 
[in Turkey]. Syria's refusal to allow the meeting to take place 
opened the way to some speculation. 
  PUK's representative in Ankara confirmed that Talabani went 
to Syria last week and stayed there for "a very brief period." 
The representative said that he has no information as to 
whether a meeting was held with Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan]. 
  It has been learned that PUK leader Jalal Talabani has now 
gone to Saudi Arabia from Syria. It was reported that Saudi 
Arabia has extended an official invitation to Talabani. The 
meeting with Talabani was interpreted as Saudi Arabia assuming 
an active interest in the Kurdish problem. 
  It has also been learned that Semdin Sakik, PKK's Amed [area 
covering Diyarbakir, Bingol, and Mus] provincial commander, has 
resigned from his post and left for Germany. It was reported 
that Sakik, who had kidney problems, resigned his position 
voluntarily and that a new commander has been "appointed" for 
Amed. The PKK circles ascribe reports of "differences" between 
Sakik and Ocalan to the "psychological warfare" being waged by 
the state.

  [Text] Ankara/Diyarbakir--Local sources claim that 
state-controlled paramilitary village guards in the southeastern 
town of Cizre, have started evacuating civilians from a crowded 
district in a bid to curb Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) 
activities there. Villagers arriving in the southeastern 
provincial capital of Diyarbakir on Tuesday, said that 400 
houses in the Cizre district of Dicle had already been evacuated 
at gunpoint. They said the remaining 600 houses in the same 
district were also being evacuated. 
  Local officials in Diyarbakir said they had not heard of the 
development but would look into claims. Villagers, who refused 
to be identified for fear of retaliation, said they too had 
applied to local officials but were given no explanation. The 
village guards, they said, were brought to Cizre from the 
villages of Silopi and had settled down in a nearby 
neighborhood. The Cizre district has come to be known as a PKK 
stronghold. 
  Villagers claim that their lives are threatened and that 
they 
are forced to listen to the guards. The fate of the evacuated 
houses is not yet known.

  [Text] During operations conducted against an illegal 
leftist organization in Istanbul, security forces caught 13 
persons. According to a statement issued by the Istanbul 
Security Directorate, security forces learned that some people 
arrived in the country in order to reactivate their 
organization. In operations launched as a result of this 
information, security forces captured 13 organization members in 
their safe houses together with two pistols, many rounds of 
ammunition, and organizational documents. 
  It was reported that some of the organization members were 
caught en route to Hatay with the aim of attending a training 
camp in Syria. During their interrogation, the suspects 
admitted that after their training in the camp they were to be 
assigned to participate in actions in the rural and urban areas 
in line with instructions to be received from the organization's 
headquarters abroad. 
  The suspects were reportedly involved in throwing bombs and 
distributing pamphlets on behalf of the organization in Izmir, 
Istanbul, Germany, Switzerland, and Netherlands. Meanwhile it 
was also learned that in 1992 the suspects underwent armed 
training in the organization's Syrian camp.

  [Text] Sanliurfa, Dec 7 (AA) -- Security forces killed six 
terrorists, including two Syrian citizens in a clash in 
southeastern Turkey today. 
  AA learned that security forces on an operation early today 
in the Zeytindagi region of Suruc township, came across a group 
of terrorists. A clash erupted between the security forces and 
the terrorists who responded with fire to the calls of 
surrender. Of the six terrorists killed, three were women. 
  Two hide-outs were found in the same operation. 
  The terrorist organization is responsible for the deaths of 
more than 10,000 people in the region since 1984, when it 
launched a bloody campaign against the Turkish state and people. 
  The two Syrian terrorists are named Mezit Muhammet Ismail 
and 
Binevs (nickname--Dilan). 
  Officials said that woman terrorist Dilan was a bloody 
militant and was being searched for for a long time.

  [Text] Paris, Dec 30 (AFP) -- Two Iranians wanted by the 
Swiss authorities for the murder of an Iranian opposition leader 
have been expelled to Iran "for reasons of national interest," 
the prime minister's office said here late Thursday [30 
December]. 
  Mohsen Sharif Esfahani, 37, and Ahmad Taheri, 32, were 
expelled Wednesday, said the office of French Premier Edouard 
Balladur. 
  The pair were suspected of involvement in the April 1990 
murder near Geneva of Kazem Radjavi, brother of Massud Radjavi, 
leader of the People's Mujahidin [MKO], an armed group opposed 
to the Iranian authorities.

<F P=106> [Jean-Claude Buhrer report: "Bern Regrets That Paris Failed </F>
To Reciprocate" -- all names as published] 
  [Text] While taking care to once again state that they have 
"excellent relations," the Swiss authorities scarcely 
appreciated the New Year's "non-gift" from the French 
Government. In any case, Bern reacted strongly to the expulsion 
by France to Tehran of two Iranians wanted by the Swiss justice 
authorities for the murder in April 1990 -- in Coppet, close to 
Geneva -- of Kazem Rajavi, brother of the people's Mujahidin 
leader. 
  Following an oral demarche, the Swiss Government repeated 
its 
protest in writing on Friday, 31 December. In a memo sent to 
the Quai d'Orsay [French Foreign Ministry], he regrets the fact 
that France respected neither the European Convention on 
Extradition of 13 December 1957, nor the convention of 27 
January 1977 on the repression of terrorism. Bern felt that 
this was "a flagrant violation of international law." 
  "The French attitude surprised us even more since, until 
that 
time, our two countries had always cooperated perfectly in the 
area of extradition," said the spokesman for the Federal 
Department of Foreign Affairs, Juerg Schneeberger. Thus, 
Switzerland agreed to hand over to France two Iranians accused 
of participating in the murder on 6 August 1991, near Paris, of 
the Shah's former prime minister, Shahpur Bakhtiar. Arrested a 
short time later in Geneva, the first suspect, Ali Vakili Rad, 
was extradited on 27 August 1991, while the second suspect, 
Zeyal Sarhadi, who was apprehended four months later in Bern, 
was extradited in turn on 26 May 1992. These extraditions 
caused a diplomatic crisis with Iran, which led Bern to 
temporarily close its Embassy in Tehran. 
<H5>  "The Incident Is Closed" </H5>
  Bern was expecting a reciprocal gesture in order to get back 
two of the presumed killers of Kazem Rajavi. The arrest of 
Mohzen Sharif Esfahani and Ahmed Taheri on 17 November 1992 in 
Paris was the fruit of a long and patient inquiry undertaken by 
the Vaud judge, Roland Chatelain, who also handled the Bakhtiar 
case. Despite the objection by the Iranian authorities in 
response to the repeated demarches, the judge never relaxed his 
grip. "What I am interested in," he explained, "is arresting 
all the killers, because I cannot allow Switzerland to be used 
with impunity for settling political matters in this way." 
  Since the beginning of the inquiry, judge Chatelain has 
pointed out that "one or more Iranian departments are directly 
involved in the murder of Kazem Rajavi." His investigation also 
allowed him to notice that in cases where Iranian opposition 
members are murdered, there are "common parameters" and 
"meticulous preparation." 
  The day after the arrest in Paris of the two Iranians 
suspected of killing Kazem Rajavi, the Swiss authorities used 
two arrest warrants issued by the Vaud judge as a basis for 
submitting a formal request for extradition to France. Last 10 
February, the Paris Court of Appeal, approved the request. On 
18 November, Switzerland was officially informed that the French 
Government had approved the extradition. 
  On 3 December, during a visit to Switzerland by Francois 
Mitterrand, the matter was not even raised since it was 
manifestly clear to the Swiss Government that the extradition of 
the two Iranians was imminent. So, while everything had been 
set in place to receive the two suspects, sources in Bern said, 
on Wednesday [29 December] the Embassy in Paris was informed 
that they would not be handed over to Switzerland -- before 
learning the next day that they had already returned to Iran. 
  Caught unaware, Switzerland could only express its 
disappointment. "This incident does not mean that the excellent 
relations with France will be called into question," Mr. 
Schneeberger said nevertheless. "Due to the lack of an 
authority of recourse from the diplomatic point of view, this 
affair is considered closed." Perhaps this conclusion suits 
everyone.

<F P=106> [Veziane de Vezins report: "The Cold Fury of Bani Sadr -- </F>
At His Home in Versailles, The Former President Deposed By The 
Mullahs Does Not Mince His Words"] 
  [Excerpts] While the presumed assassins of the opponent of 
the Tehran regime, Kazem Rajavi, are heading back to Tehran, one 
Iranian, the vestige of an attempt at democracy, and the most 
highly profiled target of the mullahs' regime, is boiling with 
indignation in his freezing house in Versailles. The former 
president of the Iranian Republic, Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who 
came to power in 1981, only to be deposed by the parliament 18 
months later, rants and raves in his own particular manner, 
[which is] both oriental and Parisian. Without dropping his shy 
smile and virtual whisper, he said: "The government is 
respecting neither its laws, nor the European extradition 
treaty. Not so long ago, it was committed to `terrorizing the 
terrorists.' Who said this is the country of human rights?" 
[passage omitted] 
  How can the French Government's refusal to extradite Mohsen 
Sharif Espahani and Ahmad Taheri to Switzerland be explained? 
Bani Sadr evokes the choice between fear of a new wave of 
terrorist activity and deliberate complicity. "Fear? I do not 
think so. Every time a government gives in to a terrorist state 
it is encouraging acts of violence. When Naccache was sent back 
to Iran they assassinated Bakhtiar. And look at Algeria. No. 
There is some form of complicity between the Iranian regime and 
the French Government." He then goes on to describe Iran as the 
"only country in the world whose foreign policy can be summed up 
as [being characterized by] terrorism, arms purchases, 
indebtedness, and large-scale corruption." 
  But what complicity? Continuing his argument cautiously, 
Bani Sadr, his gaze fixed on the floor, calls to mind Gorbachev, 
abandoned by Europe, while the Iranian regime, [which is] 
"greatly weakened and highly indebted, and which is only being 
propped up by foreign support," has received $30 billion in 
short-term aid over the last four years. "It is facilitating 
the task of these governments in the Muslim world. It stands 
for Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism. It is serving to 
supplant the threat of communism and generate fear." 
  The revolt of Bani Sadr, [who remains] motionless, is 
visible 
only on his face. He interrupts himself while tea is served, 
then puts forward a hypothesis: "If the French Government 
committed the despicable act of sending back the two accused, 
then it did so because something happened regarding Algeria. 
Perhaps France obtained an undertaking from the Iranian regime 
that it would stop providing military and financial aid to 
Algerian terrorists. If terrorism effectively ceases in 
Algeria, then France will be able to say that it scored a great 
victory." 
  Was sending back the two accused the gift offered by France 
to appease the Iranian anger provoked by the return to France of 
Mariam Radjavi, wife of the leader of the People's Mujahidin and 
the "future president" enthroned by her followers? For the 
former Iranian president, the fury of the Mullahs' press, which 
denounced French complicity with the "terrorists" of her 
calibre, was only superficial and "was unleashed just after 
Charles Pasqua [minister of interior] had started to chase the 
Algerians out of France." More precisely, "when France consents 
to send back the assassins of the Muslim Brotherhood, then it 
must consider this group to be finished. The arrival of 
Radjavi's wife did not inconvenience Iran; on the contrary. It 
indicated the defeat of the Mujahidin." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "French-Iranian Deal Preceded Release </F>
of Two Iranians Accused of Assassinating Rajavi"] 
  [Excerpt] Paris, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Paris 
sources said yesterday that France had agreed to release two 
Iranians accused of committing terrorist acts in return for 
Iranian promises including reduction of Tehran's aid to the 
armed groups in Algeria. 
  The French Government has maintained silence about the 
matter 
but French and Iranian sources claim that the sudden step was a 
result of negotiations held in Tehran by French Foreign Ministry 
Secretary General Serge Boidevaix last fall. 
  The sources said that France requested and got the following 
three concessions from Iran: 
  1. That Tehran will not encourage acts of violence on French 
territory nor against French interests abroad for a period 
extending at least until the French presidential election date 
in May 1995. 
  2. That Tehran will undertake to considerably reduce its 
aid, particularly financial and military aid, to the Algerian 
"Afghans." 
  3. That Tehran will agree to bring to trial four Iranians 
accused of killing Shahpur Bakhtiar, the last Iranian prime 
minister under the Shah, in 1991. Saud Hindi Zadeh, Khomeyni's 
nephew, is one of those who will stand trial later this month.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Brothers, we hear now another 
voice from Sudan. Sudan announced yesterday the expulsion of 
the British ambassador because he considered Sudan a British 
colony. 
  The dreams of the colonialists have returned again. The 
dreams of the West have returned again. Their ambitions in 
Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, Libya, and everywhere in the Arab world 
have returned. Their ambitions have returned again. [passage 
omitted] 
  The colonialists will pull back when they face these [words 
indistinct] these challenges and this determination; the 
determination of peoples to live freely brothers. Yes, they 
will have to be very wary. This is coming from the masses of 
Surman and Bu 'Isa only, not to mention the masses of the Arab 
nation and the masses of Libya as a whole. There are masses in 
Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Iraq, 
the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, and Sudan [repeated as heard]. 
There are innumerable masses and the colonialists will find it 
difficult to impose their dominion again on a nation that is 
beating the drums of confrontation, a nation that has decided to 
live freely. 
  Yes, brothers, we are not just talking, we are demonstrating 
with deeds. The national resistance in southern Lebanon is 
daily writing in blood the words that we are speaking now, and 
it is paving the path of liberation with the bodies of the 
martyrs of Hizballah and the Lebanese national resistance. 
There is fighting every day [word indistinct] in southern 
Lebanon and Palestine under the leadership of Palestinian Jihad, 
the Fatah Eagles, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the 
Popular Front, the Popular Democratic Front, the Popular 
Front-General Command, the Fatah of Intifadah, and 
Fatah-Revolutionary Council. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers, those who sell Palestine now in a public auction 
will be punished by the Palestinian people. Brothers, those who 
betray the Arab nation will see their just fate. [passage

  [Text] Materials will be published under this rubric

  It is necessary to determine in any flight accident whether 
it was a failure of the hardware in flight; if so, then why? It 
is exceedingly difficult, however, to ascertain the causes for 
the appearance and development of a failure from the misshapen 
and charred fragments of an accident or crash, since they are 
subject to additional influences. 
  The kinetic energy that an airframe possesses when 
encountering an obstacle is realized over a very short time 
interval, analogous to an explosion, which smashes structural 
elements into small fragments and scatters them across a 
considerable distance. This effect is magnified by the 
destruction of systems and units operating under high pressures 
using gases and liquids, the actuation of pyrotechnic materials 
and ammunition, the escape of liquid or gaseous oxygen and the 
like. The fire that arises after the ignition of the fuel, the 
mass of which is 30--50 percent of the takeoff mass of a 
contemporary aircraft, also causes considerable damage. 
  Establishing the true causes for an LP is moreover an 
exceedingly responsible matter, since decisions are made 
according to the results of the study that entail millions in 
spending, for example to improve production or structural 
elements of the airframe, refine operational processes, make 
changes in the organization and techniques for personnel 
training and perform preventive measures. 
  A system of methods and means of researching objects from 
accidents (hereinafter the system)--for the development of which 
the originators were awarded a USSR State Prize--was created at 
the NII [Scientific-Research Institute] for the Operation and 
Repair of Aviation Hardware [AT] in order to ascertain the 
causes of failures in an operative manner. The merits of this 
system are that it makes it possible to conduct research under 
conditions where: 
  --the parts and assemblies of the aircraft, on-board 
recording devices etc. used as sources of information to 
establish the causes of the failure have sustained significant 
damage or destruction; 
  --the information remaining at the disposal of specialists 
is 
in many cases preserved only in the form of microscopic traces; 
  --the functional ties between individual elements of the 
aircraft system have been destroyed, and often some of them 
cannot be found at the scene of the accident (owing to complete 
destruction, burning, landing in a body of water etc.); 
  --the failed unit that led to the accident exists in a 
single 
copy; 
  --the aircraft systems have differing functional principles 
(from mechanical to electronic); 
  --the resolution of issues pertaining to various fields of 
science (from mathematics to criminology) is required in the 
course of the research, and a considerable portion of the 
research is being conducted under field conditions right at the 
scene of the LP; 
  --all of the work is performed within a certain time frame. 
  The system is based on certain common and frequent 
scientific 
principles that take into account the specific nature of 
studying aircraft accident sites. The most important of 
those--ensuring the trustworthiness of the results--is achieved 
through the use of a host of traits and methods founded on 
various principles of physics for the accomplishment of a single 
task, the most complete possible reconstruction of information 
that was distorted as a result of the effects of destructive 
factors, the documentation of all of the results obtained in the 
process of research, the strict determination of the sequence of 
events, ruling out mistakes that could lead to the loss of 
information about a failure, and a combination of methods of 
analysis and synthesis when studying the phenomena. 
  Chief among the methods of obtaining and employing 
information on the process of development of an accident 
situation are those that provide for the use of the flight 
data-recording equipment (SOK), and especially on-board 
recording devices (BUR). The effective utilization of flight 
information when investigating a flight accident is made more 
difficult (in roughly 30 percent of LPs), however, by its 
partial or complete loss. Methods of reconstructing and 
obtaining information from damaged media (both optical and 
magnetic) have thus been developed, and are widely utilized, in 
connection with this. 
  It should be noted that the BUR (even in cases where they 
are 
physically intact in an LP) carry information about changes in a 
limited number of parameters of the flight and operation of the 
hardware. Research on the state of the aircraft must therefore 
be performed and the place where it came down studied in order 
to evaluate the operability of aircraft systems, localize the 
failure and establish its causes. A whole set of methods, 
founded on various principles of physics and engineering and 
taking into account the "materiality" of traces in parts and the 
terrain in aviation hardware failures, is used for that purpose. 
The general laws for the formation of these "informative" traces 
in the downed aircraft have been determined and methods and 
techniques have been developed that make it possible to 
ascertain them in the fragments of an airframe and "force" them 
to "talk." 
  It is possible to determine from the traces on the parts the 
conditions of their destruction (in flight or upon impact with 
an obstacle). It has been established, for example, that the 
following characteristics of the state of the AT can be 
reflected in those traces in an impact with an obstacle: 
  --the kinetic energy of spinning rotors (aviation engines, 
generators, pumps and the like); 
  --the pressure of working media (liquids, gases) and their 
mass and volume in aircraft systems; 
  --the position of controls, elements of automatic equipment, 
instruments and indicators; 
  --the presence (or absence) of residual magnetization of a 
certain level; 
  --the degree of heating of the parts. 
  Mathematical and physical modeling (part-scale and 
full-scale) of the dynamics of flight and the trajectory of 
movement of the airframe are widely used in the course of 
investigating an LP on the basis of information from the flight 
data-recording equipment. Modeling is employed in those cases 
where the information from the BUR and the data obtained on the 
state of the aircraft wreckage are insufficient to determine the 
causes of hardware failure. It is performed with the aim of 
establishing: 
  --the possibility and duration of the development of the 
damage ascertained in a part in the failure of a unit or 
assembly; 
  --the types of flaws that led to a failure recorded in 
flight; 
  --the actual conditions of the operation of the part, as 
well 
as the boundary conditions at which the ascertained flaw arises; 
  --the correspondence of the damage existing on the parts to 
a 
certain (operable or inoperable) state of the assembly; 
  --the sequence of the destruction of parts; 
  --the possibility of the practical realization of the stated 
hypotheses on the causes for the appearance of the failure. 
  In order to formulate a conclusion, we turn to methods that 
provide for the logical processing of the primary information, 
as well as analysis and synthesis of the data gathered at all 
stages of the investigation of the LP. I would like to single 
out among those the method of structuring a diagram of the 
cause-and-effect links. Standard flowcharts are used as the 
foundation, and are then clarified and supplemented in the 
course of the investigation of a specific LP. The structuring is 
performed by stages--from a known final consequence, obtained 
from an analysis of the circumstances of the LP and information 
from the SOK, to its primary cause. 
  Technical gear, both special gear and some used in other 
areas of science and technology, has been developed and is 
employed to investigate aircraft wreckage. Flying laboratories 
equipped with all of the necessary equipment for working under 
field conditions are of especially great significance. 
  This system provides for the quite complete performance of 
the tasks that arise at all stages of the investigation of an 
LP. Its effectiveness is characterized by the fact that the 
concrete cause of the failure is found in 50 percent of the 
cases, it is established that there was no failure in 40 percent 
of the cases, and only in 10 percent of the cases is a cause not 
found (likely or possible causes are indicated). 
  It must be noted in conclusion that one feature of improving 
the system of methods for investigating crashed aircraft is its 
ever greater algorithmization, thanks to which the necessary 
preconditions are created for a fundamentally new stage--the 
adoption of expert systems (ES) into the practice of 
investigating flight accidents. These are distinguished by the 
fact that they are oriented toward resolving a broad range of 
tasks in areas that were not formalized before, which were felt 
to be little accessible to the use of computers. 
  The specialists using ESs in the course of investigating an 
LP can surpass the capabilities of experts in that realm. This 
would make it possible to expand the circle of issues they 
resolve by accumulating the knowledge of highly qualified 
experts in the ESs. 
  All of the agencies concerned must be brought into the 
creation of ESs (coordination of the algorithms for identifying 
a priori information, entered into the system and 
used in the future to determine the causes of failures in 
automated mode). This will facilitate a rise in the objectivity 
of the evaluations, and will make it possible to come to a 
unified opinion in the course of a specific LP investigation on 
questions of the traits and nature of the development of AT 
failures and, consequently, its causes as well, and to take 
effective and coordinated steps to prevent LPs and increase the 
safety of flights.

<H6>  4. The Chief Expert--The Commander </H6>
  Analysis of the combat losses of aviation by opposing sides 
in armed conflicts that differ in scale makes it possible, in my 
opinion, to uncover more fully the nature and determine the 
priority ranking of errors that are made by pilots in the air 
when performing missions. If we trace how fighter aviation was 
used in World War II, we can reveal the following causes of such 
errors: insufficient circumspection in battle, numerical 
supremacy of the enemy, disruption of the interaction between 
crews in a group, the use of ineffective maneuvers in a dogfight 
and the lack of suitable command and control of the battle... 
  We will consider the last cause in more detail. 
  The foundation of the command and control of subordinates in 
the course of combat operations, as is well known, is the plan 
of the air commander, which he makes on the basis of a 
clarification of the combat mission, conclusions from an 
evaluation of the situation and calculations performed. We would 
note that all of this takes place on the ground. But what about 
in the air, with an unexpected change in the situation, when the 
commander has turned over virtually all of the functions of 
getting information about the enemy to the hardware entrusted to 
him, and most often receiving just meager information from it? 
Only a wealth of combat experience, to all appearances, could 
help him to grasp the developing situation and predict its 
continuation. But unfortunately far from all have enough 
experience, and the training process will moreover not be able 
to make up for these gaps in training. 
  So then who today receives the right to make the decision to 
enter into battle? 
  If we are talking about a rank-and-file pilot, then he 
rarely 
enjoys that right, as before--only in the course of an intercept 
of a solitary airborne target. It is appropriate here to recall 
the experience of the recent war in the Persian Gulf, where solo 
sorties were not recorded at all, even though the aviation was 
operating primarily at night. The flight (four aircraft in 
tactical aviation and three in strategic) was the tactical 
entity entrusted with the fulfillment of independent missions. 
Group battles and strikes constituted the foundation for the 
employment of aviation, while organizing the interaction among 
crews remained the primary concern of the flight commander. 
  Specialists have noted that even the crews of the AWACS and 
EW aircraft coordinated operations not only among themselves, 
but also with a detail for their direct coverage--a pair or a 
flight of fighters. A Hawkeye airborne command post, an EC-130 
EW aircraft and four F-15C aircraft as an aggregate, for 
example, represented a dynamic system with controlling and 
controlled objects and uniform channels for communications and 
information exchange among them, with an informative nature 
"upward" and a command nature "downward." The effectiveness of 
the functioning of the system with feedback was evaluated 
depending on the duration of the command-and-control cycle. 
  Foreign specialists also include the flight of fighters, 
"encircled by an external environment with various threats," 
among similar dynamic systems, based on the experience of local 
wars. The crews experienced particular stress in combat 
operations when protecting the aircraft of strike groups, and 
concretely in those situations where the enemy, making use of 
camouflage and military cunning, selected the most favorable 
moment for attack. 
  The proposal to utilize the variation of first takeoff, and 
then the posing of the concrete task, was adopted as the 
standard one, taking this circumstance into account. The 
commander was forced to perform such labor-intensive processes 
as evaluating the situation, analyzing the possible options for 
action and planning the battle right in the course of the 
flight, simultaneously devoting the lion's share of his 
attention to piloting the aircraft. 
  The scarcity of time for the mental work of the pilot, as 
has 
already been emphasized, brought about the necessity of creating 
on-board expert systems. It was, however, not difficult to 
assume that the "electronic assistant" should function in 
different ways in those cases where a dialogue is conducted with 
it by, for example, a rank-and-file pilot or the leader of a 
flight: the former, after all, is controlling just an aircraft 
and its weapons, while the latter, aside from that, is also 
controlling subordinate crews. The latter is moreover also 
obliged--and this is one of his chief tasks--to turn the four 
fighters into a powerful combat entity able to win a victory in 
group battle. Specialists have determined that the commander, in 
order to achieve that aim, should make a so-called 
organizational decision, after assessing the situation, based on 
the competent disposition of forces before battle and the 
efficient distribution of functions among the crews. 
  What do those functions consist of apropos of the actual 
conditions of the group combat flight? 
  The aircraft flight formation, to the extent of the 
development of aircraft technology and armaments along with the 
growth in the combat potential of fighters, was opened up to 
such intervals and distances that at first provided for the 
preservation of visual contact among the crews, and then became 
commensurate with the distance for launching air-to-air guided 
missiles with semi-active radar homing heads. Visual contact 
among pilots was broken off as a result. 
  The command and control of subordinates that you cannot see 
is a difficulty that was experienced to the full by the pilots 
who took part in the armed conflicts in the Near East at the end 
of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s. The enemy, along with 
everything else, was constantly jamming the sole channel for 
information exchange among the crews--radio communications. 
Under such a variation, at the threshold of the development of 
fighter aviation called "go out separately, but fight together," 
the functioning of a dynamic system with a large number of 
objects under command and control became simply ineffective. One 
aircraft was then dropped from the flight of four fighters. The 
three-element structure proved to be more suited to waging 
all-aspect battle, the "crux" of which was considered to be a 
missile attack on straight-on headings. 
  This step led to an appreciable change in the redistribution 
of functions among the crews in the course of aerial battle. The 
departure from the principle of "shield and sword" (one covers 
and the other attacks) entailed the rejection of mutual coverage 
of fighters. Completely new tasks--decoy operations, the 
performance of break-off, back-up or free maneuvers 
(augmentation of efforts)--were designated at the same time. It 
was only necessary to distribute them correctly among the 
controlling and controlled objects (the function of "sword"--the 
"strike aircraft"--was preserved). 
  The commander of the threesome automatically became the 
"strike" aircraft while supervising the two subordinate crews, 
which were delegated other functions than his. When a flight 
used to go up in full complement (four) in a single tactical 
entity with its own definite mission, a pair of aircraft was 
formed. The crews, having received a specific combat assignment, 
operated not spontaneously but rather in accordance with a plan 
developed earlier. A strike against the enemy, which was then 
augmented, was made according to the rules that were discussed 
earlier (AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA, 1993, No. 1) after the decoy 
operations. The "free-maneuver" group (or aircraft) operated at 
that moment "according to the situation," ready at any moment to 
assist a crew that got into a difficult situation. 
  Some fighter pilots have in recent years unfortunately begun 
to forget such a crucial stage of the preparation for flight as 
the development of a plan for the impending battle. The reason 
for this is the widespread opinion that only improvisation is 
characteristic of the true master. The experience of both the 
recent and the now-distant past forces us to approach an 
evaluation of the professionalism of the pilot today, and 
especially the leader of a group, with different standards. 
Today he should be not only an excellent pilot and shooter able 
to lead a four-aircraft element, but also be recognized as a 
leader able to evaluate and predict a complex situation, plan 
group battle, organize interaction in the air and independently 
make comprehensively well-founded decisions on the application 
of the forces subordinate to him. 
  It would not be superfluous in this regard to refer to the 
Manual of Combat Operations of U.S. Tactical Aviation, which 
says that "Leadership in battle is a talent that should be 
recognized at all levels. Individuals able to lead subordinates 
in the air must be noticed in timely fashion and promoted. The 
talent of the commander is usually manifested in the course of 
warfare, but the ability to think and reason intelligently is 
acquired beforehand." 
  The crisis in the sphere of the mental activity of the pilot 
has forced the aviation command in the United States to take the 
path of training pilots in the skills of "intelligent reasoning" 
in duels with an active "enemy." Each tactical-aviation 
squadron, as is well known, takes part every year and a half in 
the Red Flag exercises at the Nellis test range, specially 
equipped for the purpose. More than a hundred simulated PVO 
[air-defense] assets and an "aggressor" squadron operate in 
complete accordance with the tactics of a likely adversary, not 
"playing along" with the trainees. The pilots can receive a 
"homework assignment"--refine poorly mastered elements of 
weapons delivery--after the completion of the exercises and 
analysis of the results (chiefly the "losses"). 
  The white heat of training of the mind weakens appreciably 
at 
"home," however, since the principal impetus to pose tactical 
riddles to the pilot--the "enemy"--is lacking. The 
standard-issue simulator equipment available at each air base is 
little help in the development of tactical thinking among the 
pilots, since it by and large facilitates only their acquisition 
of motor skills in operations in a concrete situation. 
  American specialists feel that it is essential, first and 
foremost, to fill in the vacuum between the expense and 
complexity of the training process, on the one hand, and its 
simplicity, on the other, in order to achieve even an 
inconsiderable rise in the intellectual level of the pilot. They 
feel it mandatory in this regard to put the trainee into an 
operating mock-up of the cockpit of a combat aircraft--it would 
suffice to put the moving situation being evaluated by the pilot 
onto a special desktop screen that is analogous to the display 
inside the cockpit. 
  Several "desks" with such screens have been installed in an 
already operating system for training flight personnel in the 
evaluation of a situation and making tactical decisions. The 
aerial situation is simulated on the screen in the form of 
aircraft blips ("own" and "enemy") by the supervisor of the 
classes, who can where necessary break off a flight and even 
"take a step backward" for the extemporaneous investigation of 
erroneous decisions. 
  The important conclusion was drawn, according to the results 
of the first simulations, that they were none other than a 
continuation of the training process of the likely adversary and 
the concluding stage of the mathematical modeling in the course 
of which the logical framework of the battle is formulated. The 
exercise using full-scale modeling is in turn defined in the 
course of the flight experiment, and only after its completion 
are recommendations issued for the practical assimilation of 
tactical innovations by flight personnel. 
  A study of the experience of fighter operations in real 
battles and semi-full and full-scale modeling has made it 
possible for me to develop a very simple algorithm of the 
resolution of a task according to an analysis of the situation 
by a flight commander (see diagram). This process, in my 
opinion, should begin from the moment when the group target has 
been detected, and its azimuth, range, speed, altitude and 
direction of flight, as well as the numerical composition, 
determined. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-001C-08A>           Algorithm of Situation Assessment </FIG>





    Block one--"correlation." It is felt that the 
flight should enter battle with forces equal to the enemy. A 
numerical inequality of forces could be established after 
identification of the specific situation, however. Then the 
model of battle "in the majority" or "in the minority" takes 
effect. 
  Block two--"weaponry." The fighters could prove to 
be in a situation where they have a "surplus" or "shortfall" of 
firepower; that is, there are greater or lesser areas of 
effective engagement for the on-board weaponry than the enemy. 
An advantage in firepower makes it possible to compensate for 
shortfalls in "quantity." 
  Block three--"points." The point of engagement at 
which the fighters should arrive strictly on time is designated 
when performing the task of covering strike groups. This cannot 
always be accomplished, however, under the rapidly changing 
conditions of contemporary battle. Any skirting maneuvers, most 
naturally, are ruled out in the event of lateness, for instance, 
and there remains just one chance for victory--a frontal strike 
(head-on battle). The "weaponry" moves to the forefront in such 
a situation--greater permitted launch ranges of missiles should 
compensate in full for lateness and have an effect on the 
configuration of the disposition of forces before the start of 
an attack. The precise or early arrival at an assigned point 
brings about the necessity of employing some tactical maneuvers 
("claw" or "dragon"). 
  Block four--"position." After reaching the point 
of engagement, the flight could prove to be at too small or too 
large a heading angle in relation to the enemy for a reliable 
attack, and higher or lower than the target. The flight 
commander, proceeding from tactical considerations and with a 
regard for the maneuverability of the aircraft as well as the 
destructive capabilities of his weaponry, should determine the 
most advantageous position for the performance of a standard 
method of attack by the flight. It should be emphasized that 
"one's own" methods and combat formations correspond to each 
position. 
  It is not difficult to note that the proposed algorithm is 
nothing more than the simplest model for the resolution of a 
tactical task. It could be made more detailed and supplemented 
with blocks at that or a lower level. It is proposed that 
readers, and especially flight commanders, do so.

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel A. Bekhter and Candidate of </F>
Technical Sciences Colonel (Retired) V. Lavrik under the rubric 
"IAS: Solution to a Problem Proposed": "Loss of Service Life 
Could Be Avoided"] 
  [Text] It is well known that the utilization of 
aircraft equipment for its intended purposes is limited by its 
service lives (in hours, landings, actuation cycles and the 
like) and the stipulated overall time of service. The aggregate 
of these values describes the operability reserves of the 
hardware and its service-life potential. It may be 
realized--that is, turned into flying time--at a fully defined 
rate of operation, which is defined by the ratio of the service 
life and its corresponding time of service. Losses are 
inevitable at a lower rate of operation. This potential, taking 
into account hardware that is in storage, makes it possible to 
have, for instance, yearly flying time of 300--400 hours per 
aircraft in frontal aviation. The aircraft often actually fly 
about 100 hours, and the pilots 50--70, in a year. A small 
number of aircraft engines and assemblies moreover come in for 
repairs without a fully utilized service life, owing to the 
expiration of the overall time of service. What is the reason 
for that? First and foremost, of course, the decreased 
appropriations for defense and shortages of engineering and 
technical personnel, fuel and spare parts. But also the 
complexity, increased many times over under these conditions, of 
the tasks of command and control, requiring a systematic 
assessment of the factors affecting the rate of operation. The 
discussion here concerns new approaches to performing that 
assessment, making it possible to increase the effectiveness of 
the utilization of service-life potential. 
  It seems at first glance that if the overall flying time of 
an aircraft is counted in hours, then there should be no 
fundamental difference between flying time and calendar time of 
service, and the reliability of the hardware could be assessed 
using either of those values. But that is not so. The extent of 
corrosion, aging and biological damage to the airframe depends 
on the calendar duration of operation, while overall flying time 
characterizes the operation of the hardware and its wear and 
tear and fatigue damage accordingly. A criterion that takes into 
account both accrued run time and time of service is thus 
necessary for a complete accounting of the whole spectrum of 
demands in effect. Since the aviation hardware is employed with 
interruptions, the extent of realization of the service life 
within the limits of a certain period of calendar time can be 
described by the average daily rate of its expenditure. 
  The time of service (T) of an aircraft may be represented as 
the sum of the times of pre-operational storage 
(T&lt;inf&gt; st&lt;/inf&gt; ) and actual operation. Expressing the latter in 
terms of service life as measured in accrued time in hours 
(&tgr;) 
and the average daily rate of its expenditure (&eegr;), we have: 
  T = T&lt;inf&gt; st&lt;/inf&gt;  + (&tgr;/365&eegr;), years (1) 
  We will put equation (1) into a form convenient for 
analysis: 
  &tgr; = (T - T&lt;inf&gt; st&lt;/inf&gt; )365&eegr;, hours (2) 
  Whence it can be seen that an increased rate of service-life 
expenditure is necessary to provide one and the same accrued 
operating time when the storage time is increased. Two causes of 
losses are thus possible--owing to a low rate of expenditure of 
the service life, and owing to increased duration of 
pre-operational storage. 
  For example, where &tgr; = 2,000 hours, T = 10 years, 
&eegr; = 0.3 
hours/day and T&lt;inf&gt; st&lt;/inf&gt;  = 2 years, the service-life losses 
are 56 percent. They decrease with increases in the rate of 
operation, and rise with increases in the duration of 
pre-operational storage. If we take the storage period in the 
previous example as being equal to five years, the losses exceed 
70 percent. 
  The losses increase, at an unchanged rate of operation, with 
increases in the storage time. They can be reduced by extending 
the time of service, but at low values for &eegr; an increase in 
the time of service provides an insignificant gain. Where T is 
increased to three years and &eegr; has the same value (0.3 
hours/day), the losses decrease from 56 to 40 percent. A 
lengthening of the time of service can therefore be justified 
only with a sufficiently high average daily rate of expenditure 
of the service life. 
  How can losses of service life be avoided? An 
answer may be obtained by solving equation (2) for &eegr;. If a 
guaranteed running time &tgr;&lt;inf&gt; g&lt;/inf&gt;  for an aircraft engine 
is 2,000 hours, for example, and it was stored for three years 
before the start of operation (before expiration of the 
effective term of storage) with a guaranteed time of service 
T&lt;inf&gt; g&lt;/inf&gt;  of 10 years, the required average rate of 
expenditure of the service life should not be less than 0.78 
hours/day; that is, the annual accrued running time should not 
be less than 285 hours. 
  We would note that this methodological approach could also 
be 
extended to the case of the storage of items in a non-mothballed 
state on board an airframe, with their occasional testing under 
standard servicing procedures. If the item is a removable one 
and the testing is performed in the interests of ensuring its 
readiness for utilization, however, it must be taken into 
account that some of the service life will have been expended 
even before the start of operation. 
  We will consider a more general case. We will assess the 
rate 
of expenditure of the service life of an airframe within the 
context of a whole operational cycle, with a regard for the 
hardware being in various states (use for its intended purpose, 
maintenance and restoration of operability, waiting in good 
working order, storage). The duration in each of them describes 
one of the operating properties of the airframe (failure-free 
operation, maintainability, operational feasibility, longevity) 
with a regard for the level of perfection of maintenance (TO) 
and logistical support (MTO), while the rate of expenditure of 
the service life reflects the manifestation of those properties 
as a whole. This value at the same time acts as an indication of 
the productivity of the airframe (in the form of flying time, 
for example, or the number of aircraft-sorties per unit time). 
  The rate of expenditure of service life (K) in such a 
representation serves as a criterion of the operational 
technical quality: 
  K = (T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt; /(T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt;  + t&lt;inf&gt; r&lt;/inf&gt;  + 
t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt;  + t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  + 
t&lt;inf&gt; wls&lt;/inf&gt; ))K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt; , (3) 
  where T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt; /(T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt; , t&lt;inf&gt; r&lt;/inf&gt; , 
t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt; , t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  and t&lt;inf&gt; wls&lt;/inf&gt;  are the 
cumulative amounts of time the airframe is in flight, undergoing 
restoration of an operable state, planned maintenance, waiting 
for maintenance (airframe idle time for organizational reasons) 
and waiting for logistical support (idle time waiting for spare 
parts) over the span of a certain operating period, and 
K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  is the work time utilization factor. 
  The value T&lt;inf&gt; t&lt;/inf&gt;  is a measure of the usefulness of an 
airframe, and describes its failure-free operation. The duration 
of restoration (t&lt;inf&gt; r&lt;/inf&gt; ) and planned maintenance 
(t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt; ) reflects the expenditures of time to find and 
eliminate defects and maintain operability, and describes the 
maintainability of the airframe. One may judge the level of 
perfection of the TO and MTO by the values t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  and 
t&lt;inf&gt; wls&lt;/inf&gt;  respectively. The work time utilization factor 
K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  shows what share of the year's time is 
relegated to the operation of the airframe, and what share to 
idle time during non-working time. K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1, for 
example, with around-the-clock work on the hardware. 
K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt; = 0.237 with an eight-hour work day and a 
42-hour work week (yearly work time reserve equal to 2,080 
hours). 
  The following group of summary indicators, consistently 
revealing the effects of the characteristics described on the 
rate of service life expenditure, can be singled out from 
expression (3). 
  1. Where t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt;  = t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  = t&lt;inf&gt; wls&lt;/inf&gt; 
= 0 and K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1, we obtain an indicator of 
reliability that takes into account the joint manifestation of 
the absence of failures and maintainability (K1). 
  2. Where t&lt;inf&gt; wm&lt;/inf&gt;  = t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt;  = 0 and 
K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1, we calculate the summary indicator of 
reliability and operational feasibility (K2). It reflects the 
likelihood of the airframe being in an operable state under 
conditions of idle time only for planned and unplanned 
maintenance. 
  3. Where t&lt;inf&gt; pl&lt;/inf&gt;  = 0 and K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1, we 
obtain an indicator that also takes into account the effects of 
the characteristics of the actual system of maintenance on the 
operational technical quality of the airframe (K3). 
  4. Where K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 1 and all values in the 
denominator are not equal to zero, the effects of the system of 
logistical support are taken into account (K4). 
  5. Under the latter (paragraph 4) conditions but where 
K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  &lt; 1, we also obtain the idle time of the 
airframe in non-work time (K5). 
  The indicators K1--K5 thus make it possible to calculate the 
rate of expenditure of airframe service life with a regard for 
its operational level, organization of operations on the 
equipment and the quality of the functioning of the system to 
supply spare parts. The unit of these indicators is an hour of 
flying time per hour of operation. By multiplying the value of K 
by the duration of the year in hours, we obtain the available 
yearly flying time of the airframe (T&lt;inf&gt; a&lt;/inf&gt; ). We would 
note that the required value of the yearly flying time 
(T&lt;inf&gt; req&lt;/inf&gt; ) for the complete consumption of the service 
life (R&lt;inf&gt; f&lt;/inf&gt; ) is equal to the ratio of that service life 
to the corresponding time of service. 
  The methodological approach set forth provides an 
opportunity 
to move to a determination of the value of the service-life 
potential of an airframe that could be realized over a 
designated span of time of service--that is, to an assessment of 
the attained rate of expenditure of the service-life potential 
of an airframe and its juxtaposition with the required one. That 
will now make it possible to predict the using up of the 
service-life potential and, where necessary, to make the 
corresponding corrections in the organization of IAS [aviation 
engineering service] operations based on a regard for the 
effects of the determining factors. 
  We will consider an example of such an assessment. Table 1 
presents the initial data, and Table 2 the results, for a 
comparison of two fighter aircraft, the domestic Su-27 and the 
F-15 of the U.S. Air Force.&lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt;

  The comparison shows that in operational suitability within 
the context of TO systems (under K3), the aircraft are roughly 
identical, with the domestic one better in reliability (K1) but 
inferior to the foreign in reliability and maintainability (K2) 
taken together. The F-15 has the higher quality level when the 
lesser idle time waiting for spare parts (K4) and increased 
value for K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  (K5) are taken into account. The 
attained value for K5 allows the Su-27 to serve out its service 
life without losses (it has T&lt;inf&gt; a&lt;/inf&gt;  &gt; T&lt;inf&gt; req&lt;/inf&gt; ). 
It is easy to estimate that the losses of service life for the 
foreign model are about five percent, despite the fact that it 
is operated more intensively than the domestic one 
(K&lt;inf&gt; year&lt;/inf&gt;  = 0.31). 
  The necessary reduction in idle time of the airframe for TO 
can be determined for the complete using up of the service life, 
and the corresponding measures developed with a regard for 
expenditures, according to the data cited. 
  An analysis of operational suitability based on an 
assessment 
of the rate of expenditure of the service-life potential when 
putting new airframes into service is of particular 
significance. It is known that the technology for servicing and 
the organization of technical operations depends on the design 
features of the airframe as determined by its dedicated purpose 
and the quality of design engineering and production. By 
possessing data on the airframe and varying the requirements and 
their limitations, it is possible to substantiate the most 
acceptable variation, from the time standpoint, for technical 
operation and logistical support with a regard for the shortage 
of material and human resources. 
  We turn our attention to another exceedingly important 
sphere 
of the possible application of such an analysis--the 
certification of product and production processes. Any product 
is valued markedly higher if it and the processes of its 
manufacture have a certificate of conformity--a document 
indicating that the given product and production are in 
accordance with certain requirements (standard, for instance). 
  While the flight quality of an airframe is evaluated for 
conformity to the Uniform Standards of Airworthiness, the 
assessment of the level of operational excellence requires its 
comparison with competitive models of aircraft in the given 
class. The proposed approach provides that opportunity when 
determining the competitiveness of an airframe and 
substantiating its price for both the domestic and foreign 
markets. 
  We have thus demonstrated that a sufficiently correct 
solution can be obtained for a whole series of tasks--such as 
determining the pattern of time expenditures for operations, 
predicting losses of service life and developing measures aimed 
at averting those losses and assessing the operational technical 
quality of airframes in service and under development with a 
regard for organizational, technical, economic and other factors 
and the certification of aviation hardware--on the basis of an 
analysis of the rate of expenditure of the service life of 
aviation hardware (service-life potential). The use of the 
results obtained makes it possible to increase the economic 
efficiency of aircraft operations virtually without any 
additional material expenditures, which is particularly 
important at the current time.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Velovich under the rubric "Domestic Aviation </F>
Hardware": "The MiG-29M--A Familiar Stranger"] 
  [Text] The MiG-29 is well known in our country and 
abroad, and is by rights the pride of the Air Forces and the 
Design Bureau imeni A.I. Mikoyan, where it was created. The 
improvement and development of this aircraft is continuing in 
accordance with the requirements of the times; the latest 
version is the MiG-29M. The British aviation magazine FLIGHT 
INTERNATIONAL called this MiG "the supreme weapon of Russia" in 
analyzing its characteristics. 
  The new MiG-29M fighter was displayed for the first time in 
September of 1992 at the international air show at Farnborough, 
not far from London. It differs little from series-produced 
versions in outward appearance, but that impression is 
deceiving. It is deserving of a new designation--the MiG-33--in 
the opinion of many specialists. General Designer R. Belyakov, 
however, feels that this addition to the MiG family will receive 
official recognition and its own new name only upon the 
completion of state joint testing. 
  The geometric dimensions of the fighter have remained as 
before, but the design of the airframe has undergone substantial 
changes. Upper outlets for the air intakes are lacking, first 
and foremost. The protection of the engine against the ingestion 
of foreign objects is now ensured by a protective grill mounted 
in the duct. This device is analogous to that employed on the 
Su-27, but has a number of differences as well that, in the 
words of aircraft chief designer M. Valdenberg, have provided 
for the reliable protection of the protective grill against 
icing. The new device was subjected to forced verification 
during flight testing--a duck got into one of the air intakes 
during takeoff. The grill only sagged slightly, but the engine 
sustained no damage whatsoever. 
  The configuration of the wing strakes has been altered--they 
now have a sharp edge. This provides for the more energetic 
shaping of the vortex system at large angles of attack and, as a 
result of that and ailerons with increased span, for a marked 
improvement in controllability at low speeds. 
  The MiG-29 fighter has been demonstrated abroad repeatedly 
over the last several years, and one of the most frequently 
asked questions of the representatives of the firm was, "So why 
doesn't the aircraft have a fly-by-wire control system (SDU)?" 
The reason for that is the adherence of the OKB [Experimental 
Design Bureau] to the most reliable and proven engineering 
ideas. An SDU was installed on the MiG-29M, but the designers 
again used an approach that guaranteed reliability: an analog 
system with four-way back-up was used in the longitudinal 
channel, the redundancy is three-fold in the heading and roll 
channels, with one of the control loops moreover using 
mechanical wire, providing for the setting of the ailerons and 
rudder to half their full settings. 
  M. Valdenberg also substantiates the use of an analog rather 
than a digital SDU: "I am convinced that this was the correct 
decision, since it provides for greater safety and less 
likelihood of any unpleasant surprises. That is even though the 
analog SDU is more complicated and loses out in weight compared 
to a digital one." One can agree with the chief designer, 
especially if one recalls the recent accidents of the SAAB 
JAS-39 Gripen in Sweden and the YF-22 in the United States. The 
cause of both of those flight accidents was insufficient 
software support for the digital SDUs of those fighters. The 
case of the loss of a Tornado fighter/bomber of the German Air 
Force owing to the failure of the digital SDU under exposure to 
the electromagnetic field of the powerful transmitting antenna 
of a radio broadcasting station is also well known. 
  An increased-area stabilizer with a "tooth" on the leading 
edge has also been installed on the aircraft to increase the 
effectiveness of the control system. The "tooth" improves the 
flow pattern at large angles of stabilizer settings. 
  One of the noticeable outward differences of the MiG-29M 
from 
the prior model is the absence of fences running from the base 
of the rudders along the upper surface of the wings. They were 
used on the MiG-29 to house the thermal decoy target and chaff 
firing devices. This device is located under a fairing on the 
upper surface of the fuselage on the latest model. 
  There is an air brake of large area (more than one square 
meter) located behind the cockpit. The longitudinal moment that 
arises when setting the panel is countered automatically by the 
SDU. One braking chute with an area of 17 m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  has 
been replaced with two of 13 m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  each. The reinforced 
landing gear, designed for the maximum takeoff weight, has a 
brake with enhanced power, which reduces the length of the 
runout. 
  The forward portion of the fuselage, of welded design, is 
made of aluminum-lithium alloy. This has provided a sharp 
reduction in weight, since there is no need to make the joints 
airtight in the fuel tank/compartments or cockpit, there are no 
overlaps for riveting and the unit mass has been reduced. There 
is another advantage to this design--the complete utilization of 
internal spaces to hold fuel. This could not be done in a 
rivet-fastened design, owing to the impossibility of making all 
of the rivet seams airtight. 
  Composite materials are widely used on the MiG-29M, as on 
the 
MiG-29. The air brakes, engine cowlings, air-intake ducts and 
rudders are made of them. The design of most of the enumerated 
elements is composite-honeycomb, which markedly reduces the 
weight and provides quite high rigidity. 
  The fundamentally new design and the additional internal 
volume freed up after the elimination of the upper intakes has 
made it possible to increase the fuel reserves by 1,500 
l, bringing them to 5,700 l. The flight 
range at cruising speed and altitude has been increased from 
1,500 to 2,000 km. Three external fuel tanks (a center tank with 
a capacity of 1,500 l and two wing tanks with 1,150 
l each) provide a ferry range of 3,200 km. Many 
pilots in line units have repeatedly pointed out the 
desirability of increasing the operating range of the MiG-29. 
The designers took those wishes into account in the new model. 
The longitudinal instability of the aircraft and the use of an 
SDU have also facilitated an increase in range, in view of the 
decrease in balance losses in cruising mode. 
  The principal tactical-performance data typifying the 
maneuverability (sustained positive G forces in a banked turn, 
rate of climb, acceleration time) for the MiG-29M have remained 
at the prior level, but one improvement was the marked increase 
in the allowable angles of attack and, as a consequence of that, 
the available G forces for non-sustained maneuvers. 
  The new fighter has a limiter of maximum modes that does not 
permit it to go beyond a set angle of attack. The maximum value 
in testing was set at 30&deg;, but M. Valdenberg feels that the 
"bar" will be raised upon the completion of testing. R. Belyakov 
describes the MiG-29M thus: "This is the best aircraft in the 
world overall from the standpoint of overcoming stalling and 
spins. The MiG-29 had already been brought to a high level, and 
we have gone even further with the MiG-29M." 
  The RD-33K engines have thrust with afterburners of 8,800 
kgf, which is 500 kgf more than the series-produced RD-33 
engines. The letter K signifies that they belong to the 
shipborne MiG-29K version, where the increased thrust achieved 
by the installation of a new fan with increased air consumption 
supports ramp takeoff from the short deck of aircraft carrier. 
An integrated digital regulating system for the engine is 
envisaged that also devises control commands for the flaps of 
the air intake. 
  The MiG-29M, as opposed to its predecessor (intended by and 
large for the destruction of airborne targets), is a true 
multirole tactical fighter with a rich arsenal of air-to-surface 
guided weapons. The war in the Persian Gulf visibly demonstrated 
the decisive significance of so-called "smart" weapons. R. 
Belyakov relates that many potential export customers have 
appealed to the OKB to expand the capabilities of the MiG-29 in 
operations against ground targets. 
  The weapons control system (SUV) on the MiG-29M is a new 
one. 
Its foundation is the multifunctional pulse-Doppler radar 
developed by the Fazotron NPO [Scientific-Production 
Association], operating with high, medium and low pulse 
repetition rates. The antenna is a planar slit array. Even 
though the range of airborne target detection has effectively 
not increased, the variety of operating modes and the 
"intelligence" of the set, including jamming protection, has 
become substantially more extensive. 
  The air-to-air modes include tracking of up to ten targets 
in 
fire-and-forget mode, and the simultaneous firing on two to four 
of them in open space or against the ground. The automatic 
lock-on of targets from vertical-scan mode is provided in 
close-range air-to-air combat. 
  The set of air-to-ground modes is very broad--mapping with a 
active beam and synthesized aperture, enlargement of the scale 
of depiction of a selected plot on a map ("electronic loop") and 
"freezing" of an image, measurement of the intrinsic speed of 
the aircraft to correct the navigational system and to 
compensate for the wind when delivering non-guided weapons, 
measurement of the coordinates of selected land or sea targets 
and support of low-altitude flight with automatic obstacle 
avoidance. 
  The electro-optic portion of the SUV has also been 
substantially refined. The optical-locating set (OLS) is 
equipped with a new and sensitive infrared receiver with deep 
cooling, which has increased many times over the range of target 
detection from thermal emissions. The power of the laser channel 
has also been boosted, and the boundaries of the range 
determination of both air and land targets have been expanded 
accordingly. The new OLS moreover supports the detection of a 
laser spot on a ground target illuminated by an external target 
designation source, as well as the delivery of semi-active 
air-to-surface missiles with laser homing (Kh-25ML and Kh-29L). 
Up to four such missiles may be accommodated on the internal 
stores racks under the wings. 
  The OLS also has another television channel, which provides 
for the identification of air and ground targets at greater than 
visual ranges. There is a mode for the televised correlation 
tracking of a ground target. Kh-29T guided missiles and 
adjustable KAB-500KR aerial bombs with television homing heads 
may be delivered either singly or in salvos. The helmet-mounted 
target-designation system has also been modified, by and large 
with the aim of reducing the weight of the gear. 
  The aircraft cockpit has two multifunctional electronic 
indicators and a new head-up display (ILS) indicator. The 
concept of command and control of all SUV modes without removing 
the hand from the aircraft control stick or the engine control 
levers has been realized on the MiG-29M. The ILS has become the 
principal piloting instrument, and the small piloting 
instruments with round dials in the center of the instrument 
panel are only back-ups in the event of the failure of the 
electronic indicators. The "ahead and down" field of view has 
been improved (to -15&deg;) through the raised position of the 
pilot in the cockpit. 
  The MiG-29M has the same 30mm GSh-30 cannon, but its 
ammunition load has been reduced from 150 to 100 rounds. The 
general designer explained that "the cannon is principally 
employed against aerial targets. The MiG-29M is provided with 
high aiming precision, and just five to seven shells are 
required to shoot down a target." 
  The number of wing stores racks has been increased from six 
to eight, while the central one under the fuselage has been 
preserved. This provides for a maximum bomb load of 4.5 tonnes 
(nine 500-kilogram bombs). 
  The capabilities to counter the opposition of PVO [air 
defenses] have been raised substantially. An active jamming set 
and gear to warn of illumination (SPO) have been installed on 
the MiG-29M, and the store of jamming rounds has been increased 
from 60 to 120. 
  The SPO can not only warn the pilot, but also control the 
passive antiradar heads of the Kh-25MP and Kh-31P missiles, of 
which the MiG-29M can carry up to four. The Kh-25MP missile has 
a mass of about 320 kg and a maximum launch range of up to 40 
km, and is intended principally to defeat the Hawk SAM radar. 
The Kh-31P high-speed antiradar missile, with a ramjet engine 
developed by the Zvezda NPO, can defeat all existing homing and 
fire-control radars of contemporary SAM systems, including the 
Patriot, as well as the detection and warning radars of 
air-defense systems. Its launch range is up to 100 km, with a 
mass of about 600 kg. 
  The air-to-air weapons include the latest development of the 
Vympel MKB [Design Bureau]--the RVV-AE missile with an active 
homing head. This is the domestic analogue to the American 
AMRAAM missile. The RVV-AE has inertial guidance with radio 
correction and active radar homing on the final leg of its 
trajectory, making it possible to fire on several targets 
simultaneously. The MiG-29M is armed with eight such missiles, 
which gives it a very impressive appearance. The missile can 
defeat targets maneuvering at up to 12 Gs. The maximum launch 
range on closing headings and at high altitudes and speeds 
reaches 100 km, but a value of about 40 km can be considered 
typical for the conditions encountered most often. 
  The number of R-27 semi-active missiles accommodated has 
been 
increased to four, two of which can be R-27RE with a launch 
range increased to 130 km. Even though the full maximum launch 
range of this missile is not realized on the MiG-29M owing to 
their limited lock-on range, their use could nonetheless prove 
to be decisive in a closing missile battle at medium ranges. A 
missile with increased power has a higher average flight speed, 
and the gain of a few seconds in hitting the enemy deprives his 
semi-active missile the opportunity to continue guided flight. 
  The Mikoyan OKB has always assigned great significance to 
reliability and maintainability in its aircraft. No less 
attention is devoted to those aspects today than to the tactical 
flight characteristics or the features of the SUV. General 
Design R. Belyakov reported that the average run time between 
failures for a MiG-29M will be no less than eight hours, and the 
combat readiness of the fighter fleet will be at the 90-percent 
level. The average duration of the pre-flight preparations for a 
solitary aircraft is 30 minutes, and the time to prepare for a 
repeat sortie is 15--25 minutes, depending on the choice of 
weaponry. The total unit labor-intensiveness of maintenance is 
11.5 man-hours per hour of flying time. The average time to 
restore an operable state should not exceed 1.2 hours, with a 
frequency of routine maintenance operations of 200 hours. The 
time necessary to replace an engine is 2.2 hours, including 
breaking it out, greasing it and testing, with a 
labor-intensiveness of 5.3 man-hours. 
  The MiG-29M should be a long-lived aircraft, with its life 
cycle extending well into the next century. 
  The fate of the new fighter could shape up in different 
ways, 
owing to the sharp cutbacks in defense spending. First Deputy 
General Designer A. Belosvet describes the situation thus: "A 
fundamentally new financial program has been lined up and signed 
for this aircraft. It should go to the Air Forces, which will 
evaluate it and perform field testing. The Air Forces are 
essentially running the program." 
  World practices really do not know any examples of the sale 
of a combat aircraft abroad that is not in service with the 
manufacturing country. Several years ago the American firm of 
Northrop tried the creation of a special export fighter, the 
F-20, but even the Third World countries refused to acquire it, 
preferring to pay more to obtain the U.S. Air Force tested F-16 
from General Dynamics. 
  R. Belyakov feels that the opportunities for the export of 
the MiG-29M are very good: "This multirole aircraft, with the 
highest effectiveness in the performance of both air-to-air and 
air-to-ground tasks, is a twin-engine aircraft, which is very 
important for operational safety in peacetime. It has small 
reflecting surfaces compared with its competitors, and a small 
signature. We feel that it will find application." 
  The OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan is also offering collaboration to 
European countries in the creation of a new European fighter 
based on the MiG-29M and further developments of it. The new 
Eurofighter that is now under development, in the prestigious 
opinion of the general designer, is in no way superior to the 
MiG-29M. This proposal is being discussed with interest in 
aviation circles and in the pages of the foreign press, but "the 
reaction so far is guarded." 
  More evidence in favor of the MiG-29M is the fact that 
relatively larger and more expensive aircraft such as the 
McDonnell-Douglas F-15 can be acquired only by Israel, Japan and 
Saudi Arabia. The Grumman F-14 was procured by Iran alone during 
the rule of the shah, and Russia has supplied the Su-27 only to 
China. The number of countries supplied with the F-16, a close 
analogue to the MiG, is approaching twenty. 
  The reason for that is simple--the cost of the aircraft is 
connected directly with its takeoff mass, and that is not only 
the production price but also the cost of servicing and 
operation, which comprise the greater portion of overall 
spending over the life cycle. An aircraft with a takeoff mass of 
15 tonnes understandably requires half the kerosene for a flight 
of one hour in duration or a ferry of 600 kilometers than a 
craft weighing 25 tonnes. Today, when our country is also coming 
out at world market prices, this factor obviously can no longer 
be disregarded.
