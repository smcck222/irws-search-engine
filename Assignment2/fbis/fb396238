<F P=106> [Article by Vsevolod Solovyev: "The LDPR Defeated the </F>
Communists in Saransk. The Communists Are Content"] 
  [Text] In Mordovia the results of the parliamentary 
elections were perceived, as throughout the country, with a 
certain astonishment. But as distinct from Moscow, say, the 
people here were surprised not by the victory of the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] but by the fact that the 
present democrats obtained any substantial votes in the State 
Duma at all. 
  Two years ago, the Mordovian Soviet Socialist Republic 
(Mordovian Soviet Socialist today, as before, incidentally) 
supported President Yeltsin, elected as its republic president 
the democrat Guslyannikov, and interpreted the democrats' 
program statements as the promise of a just, replete life 
protected against the tyranny of both the authorities and 
criminals. 
  Today, however, the electorate's party slate vote at the 
State Duma elections in Mordovia was distributed as follows: 
LDPR, 34.5 percent; Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 
18.3 percent; Agrarian Party, 12.2 percent; Russia's Choice, 7.5 
percent; Women of Russia, 6 percent; YABloko, 5.2 percent; and 
the other parties and blocs, less than 5 percent. 
  As far as the new Constitution is concerned, it was utterly 
swamped in all areas of the republic (only 37 percent "for"), 
with an activity of the people's masses that was relatively high 
for that ballot--60 percent. 
  Zhirinovskiy's victory in Mordovia was predetermined 
primarily by the public's distrust of both the democrats and the 
communists. In addition, Vladimir Volfovich came to Saransk in 
person and won the voters' affections, skillfully demonstrating 
his concern for their problems. 
  "I had no choice," one 40-year-old man told your SEGODNYA 
correspondent. "Zhirinovskiy is educated and forceful. He gives 
the favorable impression of being a strong person who knows what 
he is saying. Everyone has now suddenly begun to intimidate us 
with Zhirinovskiy. He is a fascist, they say, he means war. No, 
I do not believe that he is a fascist. He is a worthy 
replacement for Yeltsin. He should be given power, and if it 
turns out that war really does come with him, we will elect 
someone else or will fight him. As far as the democrats are 
concerned, we had begun to fear them here, in Mordovia, like the 
plague, and as for the communists, well, we had replaced them 
with the democrats." 
  This is the thinking of the majority of those who voted for 
Mr. Zhirinovskiy. They are not interested in what specifically 
Vladimir Volfovich is offering in the sphere of policy or the 
economy. It is enough that he is very easy to understand in his 
criticism and abuse of the present authorities. For example, he 
is promising to do away with crime, which in Saransk is 
considered problem No. 1, at a stroke. And no one is interested 
in why this cannot be done by the present authorities and in how 
this will be managed by the LDPR. 
  It was said at one plant in the city: "Democracy here is 
something remote from the people. They cannot even meaningfully 
say how their programs differ from one another. But our plant is 
on the point of coming to a halt, and how am I to feed my 
family? Not with their inflation. They have not kept a single 
promise. The president promised to lie down on the track. The 
time has long since expired; why has he not done so? The people 
are openly disenchanted and embittered by the fact that 
everything is falling apart, and the people are of no concern to 
the democrats. Just bribes and bribes. Away with them, they are 
even matching the communists. Medvedev, for example. He is from 
Mordovia. One of ours. Everyone here knows him as a fervent 
communist, and he has of late been working for Yeltsin. Neither 
the democrats nor the communists here call him anything other 
than a prostitute, but the authorities are feeding him, so they 
need him, consequently. But they are not feeding us. So for whom 
to vote?" In a word, things are with the democrats in Mordovia 
today as clear as could be. As Sergey Serebyrakov, who ran as a 
YABLoko candidate, said, the democratic movement here has 
suffered political collapse. Not, in the main, on account here 
of severe impoverishment, which cannot be seen in the republic, 
but because of the ineptitude of the pro-reform authorities and 
the showdowns among them. 
  Egon Gauer, the prominent local democrat, is convinced here 
that "people sincerely support democracy, for all that. But when 
they have to express this publicly, they are afraid of the 
consequences. The authorities here are simply not democratic." 
The communists have not gone anywhere but have continued and now 
continue to control the local organs of power and 
administration. And are shunning nothing to restore power to 
themselves in full. Thus, in the course of the election campaign 
one communist candidate frightened the people with the fact that 
were the democrats to remain in power, the governors would soon 
be "Germans." 
  Since August 1991 Mordovia's communists have openly been 
making common cause with Zhirinovskiy's party. Nowhere else in 
Russia have the communists thus far formed a bloc with the LDPR. 
In Mordovia this alliance has now celebrated its second 
anniversary. The communists are united with Zhirinovskiy, as 
Ivan Dolgayev, secretary of the Mordovian Executive Committee of 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, announced, by the 
principles of patriotism and statehood. In the course of the 
recent election campaign, the communists in Saransk gave 
Zhirinovskiy's party organizational assistance in mounting his 
campaign (the LDPR's structure in Mordovia is very weak) in 
order to defeat the anti-communists, who are "ensconced in 
Moscow." It is beyond the powers of the communists themselves to 
overcome the democrats, even in Mordovia, where the failures of 
the democratic movement are obvious. 
  The results of the choice made by the public are frightening 
no one. On the contrary, they are inspiring: some to struggle 
for the reconstitution of the Soviet Union, others to organize 
an anti-fascist front. Optimism commands the thoughts of both 
the left and the right and of those in the center also, and this 
optimism of the politicians is being fed not so much by their 
own strength as by the obvious weaknesses of their rivals.

<F P=106> [Report by Arnold Pushkar: "Innumerable Diamonds on the </F>
Russian Plain?"] 
  [Text] Tula--"If the diamond find in the River Don 
Valley south of the Kimovskiy sector is considered....I 
recommend work on diamonds in Tula Oblast.... It is necessary 
initially to evaluate the prospects of the territory of the 
whole oblast, distinguish the maximum possible number of 
prospective sectors, and, depending on their diamond-bearing 
potential, select the most promising and begin within them a 
search for primary and placer diamond deposits"--these findings 
were made by the TsNIGRI [Central Geological Prospecting 
Research Institute]--the lead institute of the Committee for 
Geology and the Use of Natural Resources of Russia--on the 
report of V. Bogatov, chief of a prospecting team from Moscow 
Oblast's Gosgeopredpriyatiye. 
  As Candidate of Sciences Aleksandr Sychev, the director of 
this enterprise, said, diamond deposits have, as we know, been 
discovered in Arkhangelsk Oblast. "Pipes" akin to kimberlite 
pipes are anticipated in Tver, Nizhniy Novgorod, Kaluga, and 
Voronezh Oblasts. And in Tula Oblast specialists hope to 
discover diamond-bearing structures like those of Australia. 
  For many years geologists attacked the outlying areas of the 
Soviet Union, ignoring the middle territories. It was believed 
that the settled Russian platform did not contain surprise 
wealth connected with vulcanicity. But this all depends, for it 
cannot be ruled out that the bed of the shallow Central Russian 
sea which in distant geological eras lapped vast expanses was 
detonated by underwater volcanos that evacuated rocks containing 
diamonds, gold, silver, and rare-earth metals. 
  Geophysical, geochemical, and mineralogical work on 
diamonds, 
which, specifically, has uncovered minerals that are accessories 
thereof--garnets and chrome-diopsides like their Yakutsk 
counterparts--the so-called "Siberian emeralds"--has been 
performed in the oblast since 1989. Geologists have concluded 
that the most promising for diamonds is the marshy sector of the 
village of Beloozero's forest steppe. Twenty boreholes have been 
cut and samples taken here. 
  "The future of Tula Oblast could be linked not only and not 
so much with weapons," Aleksandr Sychev said, "but also with the 
use of such of its natural resources as diamonds and the large 
deposits of salt and celestite--a mineral for the production of 
strontium--all of whose deposits were in the near abroad. And it 
is so necessary for electronics, electrical engineering, and 
metallurgy. And, of course, new approaches to near-Moscow coal, 
which is consumed merely in power station furnaces as yet, is 
needed. This is, after all, the raw material for the production 
of many rare-earth elements. And our commission to the deputies 
of the State Duma is that they direct Russia's attention to the 
riches of the Russian Platform.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Kachayev: "Mikhail Nikolayev--the </F>
President of One-Fifth of Russia: The Chief of State of Yakutia 
Has Peacefully Achieved Special Relations With Moscow"] 
  [Text] Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)--Common opinion 
notwithstanding, the main wealth of the Northern region is not 
gold at all or even diamonds. And what increases in value 
literally by the day are the boundless expanses of Yakutia. Its 
territory constitutes one-fifth of the territory of Russia. And 
the president of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Mikhail 
Yefimovich Nikolayev, has undertaken to transform this part of 
Russia. He has not appeared at rallies, on television, or on the 
pages of newspapers. He has not been in the public eye and has 
wanted only one thing: that nobody stand in his way. 
  And now it is becoming clear: He has fulfilled and, as they 
used to say in Red old days, overfulfilled his presidential 
campaign program. In our day not everyone does this. 
  Resolute, seizing the moment, persistently finishing what he 
has started, Mikhail Nikolayev has renewed his republic without 
a lot of advertising. On 27 December he will have been president 
for two years, which means two years of work for whose results 
he need not apologize either to his people or to Russia or to 
the Lord God Himself. 
  Mikhail Nikolayev makes it possible to judge him not only 
from his words, but also from his deeds. Yakutia is now the 
sovereign Republic of Sakha, which is a part of the Russian 
Federation. 
  First the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the 
Yakut-Sakha 
SSR was declared. Then presidential rule was introduced. The 
Federation Treaty was signed. On 27 April 1992 the new 
Constitution (basic law) of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) went 
into force. It had its own seal and flag. The republic became a 
full-fledged member in the large Russian home, arranging its 
relations with the outside world as a sovereign state. 
  Skeptics must be warned that this is not a continuation of 
the so-called parade of sovereignties. The republic's political 
status has been documented on more than just paper. Mikhail 
Nikolayev cannot be silenced with titles and ranks and all the 
other attributes. As early as March 1992 he achieved the signing 
of an economic agreement with the Russian Federation whereby the 
Republic of Sakha gained the right to keep part of the natural 
resources it extracted. After the signing of the Federation 
Treaty the levels, spheres, and even objects and subjects of 
competition between the Center and the republic were determined. 
Last November the presidents of Russia and Yakutia signed an 
agreement on dividing up state property between the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The edict of 
President B.N. Yeltsin "On Immediate Measures for Implementation 
of the Federation Treaty in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)" 
took effect in August of this year. It envisions joint solutions 
to key economic problems within the framework of a special 
program. 
  In Moscow Mikhail Nikolayev achieved the conclusion of a 
separate agreement between the Russian Federation and the 
Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) on questions of federal taxation 
which makes it possible for the Northern republic to dispose of 
its financial means independently. In this regard Yakutia is 
ahead of everyone else in Russia--no other component of the 
Federation has this right. 
  Even this brief survey of Mikhail Nikolayev's political and 
economic activities during the two years of his presidency shows 
that this politician knows what he wants and is able to achieve 
the goals he sets. He completely denies accusations of 
separatism, patiently explaining: "Our sovereignty does not 
cross the line at which the disintegration of Russia begins. We 
have achieved a certain amount of economic independence so that 
we can earn our daily bread by the sweat of our brow and not 
wait for handouts from others." 
  And today Yakutia is a region with a stable economic and 
sociopolitical situation. 
  The republic is moving along the path of reforms and 
President B.N. Yeltsin's policy, constantly oriented toward 
all-Russian interests. Boris Nikolayevich himself, in response 
to the question of what he thinks about the president of 
Yakutia, said: "It has always been pleasant for me to see that 
in our new time with its paths of development which are so 
difficult for Russia new people are appearing so widely and 
freely--talented, active, capable of independently solving what 
would appear to be impossible problems. Their appearance 
gratifies me most of all and gives me the strength and 
confidence in the correctness of the work that has been started. 
For these people are to be found not only near the president and 
not only in Moscow. They are throughout our immense Russia and 
in its remote parts. 
  "Just take Yakutia-Republic of Sakha. Its president is 
Mikhail Yefimovich Nikolayev. A native northerner, Sakha by 
nationality, he has the right to take his place among the 
leading politicians and state figures. His talent has been 
revealed literally during the past two or three years. President 
Nikolayev seems to be on a creative upsurge and has far from 
exhausted his potential. 
  "Mikhail Yefimovich impresses me because he is a man of few 
words, he is thorough, and he has integrity. I know that he has 
been criticized a great deal because of his desire for 
independent actions and the elevation of the status of the 
Republic of Sakha. 
  "But President Nikolayev is a sober-minded politician, an 
energetic organizer who is not inclined toward adventurism and 
populism. He is very cautious, but he has fairly resolutely and 
courageously passed through the stage of being totally taken up 
by sovereignization. In a short period of time he has managed to 
bring the status of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) into line 
with the new requirements of life, which has made it possible to 
turn the immense territory into a high-income region with a 
stable economic situation. Nikolayev does not wait for 
instructions from above. He independently searches for ways out 
of difficult situations and always finds them in the area of 
all-Russian interests. He likes the possibility of working 
independently, being responsible for the results of his 
activity, keeping up with the times, not falling behind, and 
even getting ahead of them in some areas. At the same time he is 
guided not only by the interests of the republic he heads but 
also Russia's. I think that this is one of the strongest aspects 
characterizing him as a mature politician."

<F P=106> [Article by Valentin Mikhaylov, people's deputy of the </F>
Republic of Tatarstan, and Mikhail Birin, ROSSIYA staff 
correspondent: "Tatarstan. A Toast in Solitude"] 
  [Text] It would seem that the new year will be toasted in 
solitude in Tatarstan this year, without Russia. There have been 
neither elections to the Federal Assembly of the Russian 
Federation nor a referendum on the Constitution. If elections 
had been conducted successfully it would have meant the 
destruction of the three years of work of the local leaders, the 
essence of which amounts, strictly speaking, not so much to 
separating Tatarstan from the Federation as to removing the 
authorities of Tatarstan from the jurisdiction of the Russian 
authorities. 
  All the power has actually been concentrated in the hands of 
a single person--the local president, Mintimer Shaymiyev. He is 
the one who appoints the chiefs of rayon and city 
administrations; through the presidium he has taken charge of 
the republic's Supreme Soviet; last year he pushed his draft of 
the Constitution through, reinforcing his executive authority; 
he gave his edicts as much force as legislative acts in the 
sphere of "power management" (the Law of Tatarstan on Emergency 
Measures in Fighting Crime), and so forth. Day and night the 
entire propaganda machine has been working to make sure that 
sovereignty is firmly associated in the everyday awareness with 
low prices of products and stability of interethnic relations. 
  And right at that moment the mother country starts "poking 
its nose" into Tatarstan with its constitutional reforms. Its 
initiative evoked a statement from M. Shaymiyev to the effect 
that he himself personally would not go to the elections and 
that anyone who values republic sovereignty would probably 
follow his example. Half the work was done: At least the rural 
areas could boldly exclude voters from the lists. Two districts 
were excluded from the voting ahead of time with the help of 
games played by the apparatus. These included not informing the 
citizens (eight out of 10 people in Kazan received neither 
written nor verbal notification and many customary precincts 
changed their locations), an information blockade of the press 
and even the candidates concerning preparations for the 12 
December elections, and "undercounting" on voter lists (they 
were practically not verified and as a result entire buildings 
"turned up missing," while minors and even deceased citizens 
ended up on the voter lists). 
  The administration chiefs conducted special "training 
sessions" with chairmen of electoral commissions, whose nature 
need not be especially discussed in light of the position of the 
authorities. 
  Even such "trifles" as flying state flags at the precincts 
were not observed. For example, in Sovetskiy Rayon of Kazan 
there was not a single flag of the Russian Federation; only 
flags of Tatarstan were flown, as if actions of the "neighboring 
state" had nothing to do with them.... 
  And what is not trivial is the powerful one-sided 
conditioning of the population by the local mass media. But what 
else can one expect when 90 percent of them are under government 
jurisdiction? 
  The "war" of the leaflets had a dual character. Only 
"imported" posters, that is, brought in from Russia, were in 
favor of the elections and referendums; against them were 
leaflets of clearly local but unspecified origin, which were 
signed, true, in an extremely attractive way--"Movement for 
Justice," "Committee of Soldiers' Mothers," "Council of 
Veterans" (veterans of what--was not specified), the "Free Rus" 
(?) group, and so forth. It is noteworthy that the output of 
these still unknown authors was 10 times greater than that of 
the Russian opponents. Thus the newspaper of the National 
Radical Committee, SUVERENITET, unexpectedly and completely free 
of charge ended up in a half million mailboxes. 
  The nature of the local epistles seemed extremely diverse at 
first glance--from Jesuitical: "through your failure to 
participate in the elections you are peacefully resisting the 
adventurers who are fleecing you and your children" and "through 
the boycott we have confirmed our confidence in the public 
policy of the leadership of Tatarstan" to slogans that are 
clearly stretching acceptable limits: "participation in the 
elections means betrayal of the state interests of your 
homeland--Tatarstan!" But while establishing the differences one 
cannot but note a direction that was common to all--all of them 
called not simply for voting against the draft Constitution or a 
specific candidate, but for generally ignoring the elections 
themselves. This position played exclusively into the hands of 
the republic leadership, who can now work with the thesis: "The 
population of Tatarstan does not need a federal Constitution 
and, consequently, it needs [as published] representation in 
Russian elective organs." And this fits extremely well into the 
context of their idea of building a Federation "from bottom to 
top," whereby all that is left for the center to do is pick up 
the crumbs of the authorities delegated by Tatarstan which it 
charitably allots from its republic table. 
  The results of the voting in this area have come out right 
four times. Will this happen a fifth time as well? But the 
question is left hanging in the air because of the unexpected 
success of Mr. Zhirinovskiy and his by no means liberal and not 
at all democratic ideas. The absence of the majority of the 
reasonable population at the ballot boxes created the vacuum 
whereby the activity of proponents of a firm hand grew into a 
critical mass. Sovereignization in the version of the local 
authorities evoked rhetoric like "unified and indivisible" even 
in the astonishing version of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia]. 
  As for the politically inert population of the republic, 
they 
got what they deserve--a double defeat in civil rights. First, 
there are practically no deputies from Tatarstan in the federal 
parliament. Second--and this is the main thing--the authorities 
have now cast doubts on the legitimacy of the newly adopted 
Constitution of Russia. Although in the local basic law dual 
citizenship--of Russia and Tatarstan--is unequivocally 
guaranteed. But with the system of relations between the state 
and the individual that exists in Tatarstan today, the 
guarantees for citizens of the Russian state seem more and more 
questionable from these positions than they did before the 
December date. As one of the local readers noted bitterly: "You 
did not care? Do not complain now...." 
  [begin box, page 3] 
  When conditioning enterprise leaders they did not shrink 
from 
direct threats regarding the positions they held. 
  The victory of the LDPR was even very predictable because of 
the position of that same Mr. Shaymiyev, who actually excluded 
the entire republic from the political struggle.

<F P=106> [Article by Marat Galeyev, deputy chairman of the State </F>
Committee for the Economy of the Republic of Tatarstan] 
  [Text] Our young state is an economically developed region 
of the former USSR, whose gross social product (in 1991 prices) 
is estimated at approximately R53 billion, and in 1993 prices, 
at more than R4 trillion. The per capita industrial and 
agricultural product in the republic is more than 20 percent 
higher than the average in Russia. Tatarstan's economy is 
undoubtedly heavily dependent on the stable operation of the 
enterprises of many sectors, both of Russia and of other states 
that were formerly a part of the Union. An analysis of the 
republic's economy requires an examination of common problems, 
therefore. 
  The word "crisis," which has become habitual in recent 
years, 
is the most common characterization of the state of the whole of 
the former USSR, both in the sphere of the economy and in 
sociopolitical life. The illusory expectations of an improvement 
in life introduced to the consciousness by dishonest politicians 
as of the 1980's have led to social fatigue and the apathy of 
the majority. It is naive to expect any improvement as a result 
of elections, referenda, and so forth. Yet the crisis is not 
forever. There is, as a rule, a way out of any crisis, and not 
just one even. A society, like any person also, has a choice of 
development options. The way out of the present one will be 
particularly difficult since the economic and political factors 
of development are too intricately intertwined, and the 
politicians' actions frequently do not fit within the framework 
of common sense and have been, from the viewpoint of the 
interests of the majority, of an irrational nature. It should be 
obvious to everyone today that the economy will not be 
stabilized in a short space of time with painless medicine. What 
is needed first and foremost for a way out of the crisis is a 
correct diagnosis and then the formulation of measures and 
persistent lengthy treatment signifying in practice nothing 
other than purposeful, dogged work based on definite priorities. 
  Speaking of a diagnosis, it is essential to recognize that 
two processes are under way simultaneously on the territory of 
the former USSR: 
  1. Transition from the administrative-command state-run 
economy to a market economy. 
  2. The formation and development of a whole number of new 
states with their own economic and political interests, which 
are being manifested increasingly distinctly and which are 
gaining strength. 
  Both these processes overlay one another, which is leading 
to 
an intermingling of economic and political problems, and diverse 
knots of various contradictions are becoming entangled here, 
which is frequently superficially once again, from many people's 
viewpoint, assuming an irrational nature. A painful transition 
from the domination of one interest--the supreme-power interest, 
which was implanted for several centuries, had little in common 
with democracy, and was divorced from the individual--to a 
polycentrism of interests is under way. 
  An economy based on the interdependence of the regions, but 
with regard to economic expediency, is experiencing, following 
the country's disintegration, a particular sort of crisis. The 
economy of Tatarstan, as of other states, being a part of the 
economic complex of the former USSR, monopolized, isolated from 
the outside world, and closely interlinked, therefore, is 
experiencing the same difficulties and tackling the same 
problems as other regions of Russia and the CIS also. 
  The slump, therefore, has been caused not only by the 
transition to market reforms but also the artificial severance 
of economic ties, which has occurred not only on the basis of 
market expediency but to a considerable extent on account of a 
clash of political interests. It has to be recognized that its 
own center of economic and political interests has taken shape 
in Tatarstan also, which is the objective basis of the formation 
of its statehood. The close interaction of all the republics is 
possible today only with regard to a balance of one another's 
interests. Attempting to emerge from the crisis without regard 
to this and seeking the stabilization of the economy to the 
dictation of any center whatever is a lost cause. A particular 
feature of the economy of Tatarstan is extensive cooperation by 
no means just with the economy of Russia but with all the former 
republics of the USSR. In addition, relations are being actively 
generated with many countries of the world. Whence Tatarstan's 
interest in dealing directly, proceeding from the interests of 
the citizens of its republic. It is for this that Tatarstan 
today needs the status of subject of international law, which is 
recorded in its constitution, which was adopted more than a year 
ago and has become an instrument of political stability and 
harmony in the republic. Tatarstan's cool attitude toward the 
draft Constitution of the Russian Federation, whose authors 
completely ignored the wishes of the people of Tatarstan 
expressed at a referendum and already recorded in the 
constitution of the republic, is not surprising but natural, 
therefore. Tatarstan cannot, understandably, forgo the interests 
of its citizens to the detriment of its own economy and will 
seek to continue negotiations to establish normal relations with 
the leadership of the Russian Federation based on a bilateral 
treaty. 
  The program of radical economic reforms of Russia, which 
sets 
their general tone, put the main emphasis on price 
liberalization and assumed that prices would shape the main 
production structures. But prices perform this role only in a 
developed market economy and with the balance and conformity of 
the cost criteria and material structures and also the 
equivalent interaction of the domestic and foreign markets. As 
we all know, we still have a long way to go to achieve this 
ideal. 
  As of 1992, therefore, the Republic of Tatarstan, proceeding 
from the specifics of its sectoral structure of the economy and 
possibilities, took a somewhat different path from Russia, and 
from the Commonwealth countries also. The maximum coefficients 
of an increase in the retail prices of basic foods were adopted, 
and this ensured a smoother transition to the market and 
supported the population of the republic since prices grew in 
line with the increase in personal income. 
  But the continuing inflation is leading to an increase in 
the 
cost of living and in the cost, primarily, of basic foods in all 
regions of the Russian Federation. Under these conditions the 
relatively low retail prices in the republic engendered 
speculation and other malfeasance in trade. Protecting the 
consumer market became increasingly difficult. There came to be 
a situation requiring a serious adjustment of the policy 
regulating minimum personal income and preservation of the 
interests of the agricultural commodity producers. 
  In connection with what had been set forth by the parliament 
of the Republic of Tatarstan, a program of targeted social 
protection of the populace of the Republic of Tatarstan which 
was of an innovative nature in the Russian Federation was 
adopted. It made provision together with an increase in the 
retail prices of basic foods for targeted compensation for 
children, retirees, the handicapped, and so forth. In addition, 
a big step in the direction of an increase in the purchasing 
power of the population was taken, and the minimum wage was 
revised and increased considerably. 
  Thus the idea of the targeted nature of protection during 
transition to the market is being realized in practice. Its 
further development presupposes the monitoring of the dynamics 
of prices and incomes. Specifically, a constant adjustment of 
the minimum income at the level of the minimum consumer budget 
is contemplated as of 1 January 1994. 
  A comparative analysis of the weekly cost of a basket of 19 
most important foods in various cities of Russia and Tatarstan 
on 26 October of the current year shows that the city of 
Ulyanovsk and the Republic of Tatarstan remain the cheapest.

  The chosen particular path of market reforms, which are to a 
large extent of an evolutionary nature, also encompasses 
government regulation of the reproduction processes in the 
sectors of the agro-industrial complex. The redistribution of 
some budget funds to the benefit of the agrarian sector made it 
possible in 1993 to overcome the slump, and an increase in 
production began in the meat and dairy sectors of agriculture as 
of March. Thus production in nine months of 1993 constituted 
compared with the corresponding period of last year 102 percent 
for meat, 110 percent for milk, and 105 percent for eggs. 
Productiveness both in terms of the per-cow milk yields and the 
average daily weight gains in animal husbandry increased here. A 
relatively good cereals harvest was gathered in (approximately 1 
tonne per capita, which is a good indicator by international 
standards), and potatoes, sugar beet, and vegetables were 
harvested in a sufficient quantity. 
  The alternative economy is gaining strength in the republic 
simultaneously. 
  In the course of realization of the State Privatization 
Program, 286 enterprises with a total statutory capital of more 
than R166 billion, which employ 185,000 persons, had been 
privatized as of 1 November 1993. In 10 months of 1993 
privatized enterprises of the republic's industry had produced 
27 percent of the total commodity product. In addition, there 
are altogether a further 1,000 large and medium-sized 
enterprises approximately operating in a privatization mode, 
among which are such important associations as Tatneft, 
Nizhnekamskshina, Tatsakharprom, and Tatnefteprodukt. 
  The work performed on privatization made it possible to 
prepare the necessary economic base for the sale to the citizens 
of the republic of the 1992-issue privatization checks of the 
Russian Federation and the registered privatization deposits 
(IPV) of the Republic of Tatarstan, which our citizens began to 
receive as of August 1993. Auctions selling off shares of stock 
of the privatized enterprises and IPV have been held in the 
Republic of Tatarstan. These auctions have shown that the price 
of the shares purchased for IPV and for cash has been five-seven 
times higher than their face value. Shares of the Nefis Stock 
Company (the Vakhitov Chemical Works), the Melita Stock Company 
(fur-product works), and the Tatmetall Stock Company have been 
given a high quotation. The sale of stock at auction for IPV has 
enlivened the securities market. At the present time their 
quotation constitutes on average 1.84 of their face value, that 
is, an IPV valued at R30,000 has sold on average for R55,000, 
and in certain places, for R75,000. 
  Reform of the military-industrial complex is a sore point. A 
fundamental restructuring of the entire technology is needed for 
enterprises of the defense sector's transition to the 
manufacture of civilian products. The sharp reduction--85 
percent and more in a number of cases--in the volume of military 
orders has brought the majority of these plants and associations 
to the verge of financial collapse. 
  According to an intergovernmental agreement concluded with 
the Russian Federation, Russia and Tatarstan are to provide for 
the funding of the reprofiling of the conversion enterprises. 
The manufacture of the TU-204M passenger aircraft is being 
assimilated with the support of the ministries of industry and 
economics of Russia and the Government of the Republic of 
Tatarstan at the Kazan Aviation Production Association. Orders 
for the manufacture of machinery and components for oil and gas 
industry and for the agro-industrial complex are being placed at 
other former defense plants, and the manufacture of components 
for the new auto assembly works in Yelabug is contemplated also. 
But a substantial number of financial problems of conversion has 
simply not been resolved as yet. A special fund for ensuring a 
stable policy of the structural reorganization of the economy in 
the republic was formed recently. 
  One further lever of structural reorganization and the 
stabilization of the economy of the republic is the attraction 
for a solution of its problems of foreign capital and an 
expansion of the network of joint ventures. The stability of the 
domestic political situation and the relatively normal 
"temperature" of the economic organism are making Tatarstan 
increasingly attractive for Western businessmen. The republic 
currently has 103 enterprises in which foreign capital 
participates: firms of the United States, Germany, Italy, 
Britain, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and others. 
  The experience of recent years shows that Tatarstan, like 
everyone else, has been learning to "swim" under the new 
conditions of the simultaneous formation of its own statehood 
and market reform of the economy. This period will last for 
quite some time. A condition of the successful transition to a 
new type of economic system is politicians' capacity for 
securing the optimum combination of the objective interests of 
the citizens residing both on the territory of Tatarstan and 
throughout the space of the former USSR. Proceeding from its 
possibilities and the wishes of the people, Tatarstan is 
endeavoring here to become a worthy part of the world community 
and to develop while preserving the evolved economic, political, 
and cultural relationships with Russia and the other former 
Union republics.

Administrative-Territorial Division and Organization of Local

  [Text] 
<H5>  I. General Principles of Administrative-Territorial Division </H5>
  1. This Provisional Statute establishes the general 
principles of administrative-territorial division of the city of 
Moscow as an entity of the Russian Federation and city of 
federal status. 
  2. The system of administrative-territorial division of the 
city of Moscow is formed by: 
  the administrative okrug; 
  the municipal rayon. 
  3. The administrative okrug is an intracity administrative 
unit whose system of organs of power is structured on the basis 
of centralized government. The procedure for government of the 
administrative okrug is established by a special statute 
approved by the mayor of Moscow. 
  The city of Zelenograd forms a separate administrative 
okrug. 
  The territory of the administrative okrug encompasses 
municipal rayons. 
  4. A municipal rayon is an administrative-territorial unit 
of 
the city of Moscow within whose boundaries self-government of 
the populace residing in the given territory is effected. 
  Municipal rayons are formed taking into account the 
socioeconomic features of the applicable territories, their 
city-planning and historical characteristics, and the presence 
of residential buildings and facilities of municipal 
infrastructure. The borders and designations of municipal rayons 
are established by the Moscow City Duma upon recommendation of 
the mayor of the city of Moscow. 
  A municipal rayon is divided into microrayons (settlements) 
in which organs of territorial public self-government may be 
created. The borders and designations of microrayons are 
determined by the organs of local self-government of the 
municipal rayon. 
<H5>  II. Principles of the Organization of Local Self-Government </H5>
  5. Local self-government in the territory of the city of 
Moscow is effected on the basis of this Provisional Statute, 
legislation of the Russian Federation, and normative acts of the 
city of Moscow, taking into account its status as the capital of 
the Russian Federation. 
  6. The organs of local self-government in the city of Moscow 
are the municipalities, encompassing assemblies of 
representatives of the populace of a municipal rayon (municipal 
assemblies) and the head of the local administration (head of 
the municipality). 
<H5>  III. Local Administration </H5>
  7. The activity of a local administration is directed by the 
head of the municipality, who manages the municipal economy and 
property, develops an estimate of income and expenditures, 
ensures compliance with this estimate, and performs other 
executive and administrative functions. 
  8. The head of a municipality is appointed by the mayor of 
Moscow, upon coordination with the municipal assembly, from 
among a field of candidates recommended by the prefect of the 
administrative okrug. 
  In the event a majority of the members of the municipal 
assembly fail to agree with the candidacy presented for the 
position of head of municipality, the mayor has the right to 
present this candidacy again or to present another candidacy. 
  If the above takes place, upon failure of a majority of the 
members of the municipal assembly to agree with the candidacy 
presented, the mayor appoints an acting head of municipality 
within two weeks for a term of office of one year. The 
individual so appointed enjoys all the rights and bears all the 
responsibilities of head of the municipality. 
  A head of municipality may not engage in other paid 
activity, 
except for instructor, scientific, scholarly, or other creative 
activity. 
  9. In the event of systematic failure to fulfill his 
responsibilities or gross violation of these, the head of a 
municipality may be discharged from his position by the mayor of 
Moscow, including upon recommendation of the prefect of the 
administrative okrug or based upon an appeal of the municipal 
assembly adopted by two-thirds of the assembly members. The 
aforementioned appeal is examined by the mayor within two weeks. 
  10. The head of a municipality issues directives on matters 
within his competence as established by Russian Federation 
legislation and normative acts of the city of Moscow. 
  11. The city administration and municipal assembly have the 
right to supervise the activity of a head of municipality 
according to procedure as envisaged by Russian Federation 
legislation and normative acts of the city of Moscow. 
  12. The procedure for discharging a head of municipality 
from 
his position and of appointing and discharging his deputies from 
their positions is determined by the mayor of Moscow. 
<H5>  IV. The Municipal Assembly </H5>
  13. The assembly of representatives of the populace of a 
municipal rayon (municipal assembly) consists of from five to 
seven municipal councilmen elected from territorial electoral 
districts for a term of two years, on the basis of universal, 
equal, and direct elections under secret ballot. 
  The procedure for elections to the municipal assembly and 
the 
number of municipal councilmen are determined by the Moscow City 
Duma upon recommendation of the mayor of Moscow. 
  14. The municipal assembly is convened by the head of the 
municipality, who presides over the municipal assembly no less 
frequently than once per quarter, in order to examine draft 
resolutions he has proposed on the following issues: 
  confirmation of the estimate of income and expenditures and 
the estimate compliance report; 
  confirmation of the annual program (plan) for socioeconomic 
development and housing construction for the territory, and 
examination of the report on its implementation; 
  confirmation of the procedure for management of municipal 
property; 
  examination of other issues related to the jurisdiction of 
the municipal assembly. 
  15. A municipal assembly may be convened upon the initiative 
of Moscow City Duma, the mayor of Moscow, or a minimum of 
two-thirds of the municipal councilmen, but not more than twice 
per year. 
  16. A municipal assembly has the right to exercise 
supervisory functions, including supervision of the activity of 
the head of the municipality and procedure for the utilization 
of land parcels and municipal property. 
  17. The municipal assembly is authorized to adopt 
resolutions 
when more than half of the municipal councilmen are present at 
its session. Resolutions are adopted by a majority vote of the 
municipal councilmen present at a session and are signed by the 
head of the municipality, except for resolutions regarding an 
appeal to the mayor of Moscow on a question of discharging a 
head of municipality from his position. 
  18. Resolutions of a municipal assembly adopted within the 
framework of its competence are subject to mandatory execution 
on the part of all enterprises, institutions, organizations, 
organs of public territorial self-government, and citizens 
located in the territory in question. 
  In the event a resolution of a municipal assembly 
contradicts 
Russian Federation legislation or normative acts of the city of 
Moscow, or affects the interests of the city as a whole, it may 
be suspended by the mayor of Moscow or by a responsible official 
appointed by him. 
  19. A municipal assembly may be dissolved by the Moscow City 
Duma in instances stipulated by Russian Federation legislation, 
and also as the result of conduct of a local referendum on 
confidence in the assembly. A municipal assembly may adopt a 
resolution on early self-dissolution. 
  The election of municipal councilmen must be held not later 
than three months from the date of adoption of the appropriate 
Moscow City Duma resolution on dissolution of the municipal 
assembly, announcement of the results of referendum, or adoption 
of a decision on self-dissolution. 
<H5>  V. Territorial Community Self-Government </H5>
  20. The populace of microrayons (settlements), as well as of 
streets, blocks, and residential buildings, may establish organs 
of territorial community self-government which operate in 
accordance with Russian Federation legislation and normative 
acts of the city of Moscow. 
  21. Procedure for the formation of organs of community 
self-government is established by the municipal assembly upon 
recommendation of the head of municipality, in accordance with 
the model statute on organs of territorial community 
self-government approved by the Moscow City Duma upon 
recommendation of the mayor of Moscow. 
<H5>  VI. Transition Provisions </H5>
  22. The time frames and phases of the conduct of reform of 
local self-government in the city of Moscow are established by 
the Moscow City Duma upon recommendation of the mayor of Moscow. 
  23. Prior to adoption of the Charter of the City of Moscow, 
particular features of the management of municipal property, 
including procedure for transferring such property to the 
jurisdiction of municipal rayons and associations in the 
interest of residents of the entire city or individual parts of 
the city, are established by the Moscow City Duma upon 
recommendation of the mayor of Moscow. 
  24. Prior to adoption of the Charter of the City of Moscow, 
procedure for formation of the estimate of income and 
expenditures of municipal rayons is established by the Moscow 
City Duma upon recommendation of the mayor of Moscow. Prior to 
the creation of conditions necessary for the formation and 
implementation of local budgets, formation and implementation of 
a unified city budget is permitted, with allocation of financial 
resources to the municipal rayons.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Luzhkov, Mayor of Moscow, by Anatoliy </F>
Pankov; place and date not given: "Yuriy Luzhkov: `I Have My Own 
Addiction....'"] 
  [Text] Muscovites, of course, are interested in 
knowing what awaits us in the near future, what the city 
authorities are promising us, and how these authorities reacted 
to the recent elections to the state and city dumas. And then it 
turned out that this interview with the mayor of the capital 
came about just in time probably for our happy holiday, to a 
holiday of hopes and expectations of better days.... 
  [Pankov] As we sum up the results of the passing year in 
this pre-New Year interview, we cannot help but touch upon one 
of the most influential events of recent days--the elections. 
How do you assess the results of the elections to the State 
Duma: as a defeat of democratic forces, as a recoil from the 
reforms that are being conducted, or is everything proceeding 
normally? 
  [Luzhkov] There is no simple answer. Indeed, a number of 
parties with a centrist and democratic orientation did not 
receive that number of votes that they were counting on. 
Especially Russia's Choice. And it is necessary to talk about 
the defeat of deputies of a democratic bent. 
  But Zhirinovskiy and his party unexpectedly received very 
heavy support. Can this be called a victory? Yes, this is a 
victory in the elections. What does it indicate? First of all, 
the fact that the people are dissatisfied with shock methods of 
reform, inflation, impoverishment, Gaydar's antisocial policy, 
and the weak policy in this direction of Chernomyrdin's 
government. 
  But the conclusions should be businesslike, and not like 
Yaroslavna's complaining lament. I think that Chernomyrdin's 
government can still be trusted, but it is necessary 
fundamentally to change the team. To make not a shock policy, 
but to move toward stabilization. To abandon the course toward 
bad privatization, which will lead to a squandering of the 
national wealth. And then the people will vote for democracy. 
  [Pankov] As the mayor, what are you troubled by most of all, 
and with what kind of package of urgent questions do you intend 
to submit to the city duma? 
  [Luzhkov] I would like to find out the opinion of the duma 
and develop joint actions on questions of property in Moscow, 
and its redistribution between the capital and Russia. We are 
conducting a difficult and exhausting campaign for the right to 
own and dispose of city property. 
  In the course of the last two years, numerous efforts were 
undertaken to take property away from the city. The Government 
of the Russian Federation proceeded on the basis of one of its 
incorrect and insufficiently considered ideas that everything 
located on the territory of the Russian Federation is the 
property of Russia. 
  Policy in the sphere of privatization is still one of the 
most important questions for the duma. I have already repeatedly 
expressed my point of view: That which is being done in Russia 
today in the privatization of property is a violation of an 
owner's rights. There is no possibility here for compromise, and 
for some kind of polishing corrections. We do not agree with the 
basic principles in the evaluation of property, for the reason 
that the capital is being put in a position without rights. The 
year 1917 is being repeated, only the other way around. At that 
time, property was taken away from the private owner and made 
general state property, but now a real property owner has 
appeared--this is the city residents and those organs that 
represent the population, but Goskomimushchestvo [the State 
Committee for the Administration of State Property] says: You 
have no right to determine whether to privatize or not, it is 
incumbent upon you--and that is all. 
  This is not only my point of view, but that of the whole 
government of Moscow as well. And if the city duma supports us, 
then I will be satisfied. It is necessary for the duma to 
determine its own privatization policy in Moscow. 
  The normative base associated with the residence permit must 
also be changed. We resolutely rejected the law that canceled 
the residence permit in Moscow. And Muscovites supported us in 
this. Although it would seem that now it is better for everyone 
to look like a democrat, but we understand that nothing good 
will come of it if we do not start to coordinate principles with 
the realities of life. 
  [Pankov] Do you want to use the city duma in opposition to 
the current staff of the Russian Government? 
  [Luzhkov] The city duma is 35 specialists of a rather high 
potential (it is just that maybe not everyone understands the 
city economy well, but there are those who do). And it must 
independently determine its attitude toward one or another 
problem of interaction of the state structures of Moscow and 
Russia. I do not intend to impose my own point of view or, what 
is more, to use the city duma to resolve these questions. I am 
convinced that it will have its own position. 
  Now, your question already implies a certain confrontation 
between the governments of Moscow and Russia. This is not so. I 
repeat: The Government of Russia, especially after the arrival 
of Chernomyrdin, is doing quite a lot to resolve Moscow's 
problems. But every period requires its own resolutions. 
  [Pankov] In his postelection speech, Boris Yeltsin declared 
that Gaydar would remain in the government, and this means that 
the adopted policy on reform remains. Indeed, Chubays, "the 
father of Russian privatization," is also one of the leaders of 
Russia's Choice, and this bloc has a majority in the city duma. 
Will it not happen that.... 
  [Luzhkov] That does not bother me. Yes, Russia's Choice can 
conduct its own political line in the duma. But I am convinced 
that the deputies who are elected from various blocs must 
conduct a policy to improve the life of Muscovites, and they 
must make correct administrative, public, and social decisions. 
And then it will make sense. But if we transform the duma into a 
political discussion club, then we will repeat the principal 
error of the Mossovet [Moscow Soviet of People's Deputies], 
which occupied itself with Karabakh, the Dniester region, 
Abkhazia, Sevastopol, and the Black Sea Fleet, but almost did 
not work on questions of the life of the city. 
  [Pankov] It turns out that the mayor's office prepared the 
statute on the duma elections, that the mayor's office financed 
the elections, and that it organized and conducted them. Now the 
executive authority is readying a building and arranging 
maintenance; it has established salaries, assigned motor 
vehicles, and developed regulations. And the reception was also 
at the expense of the mayor's office. Well, will this kind of an 
initial emergence of the city duma, seemingly from the recesses 
of executive power, not have the effect that the deputies will 
consider themselves beholden to you during a review of your 
documents? 
  [Luzhkov] I am confident that it will not. You say that we 
conducted the elections, but I would put it this way: We were 
guaranteeing an administrative basis for the conduct of the 
elections. But who else was supposed to do this? And note: The 
mayor's office and the government of Moscow did not take part in 
one or another candidacy for the city duma. We made an 
announcement about our depoliticized position in this area, and 
we conducted ourselves cleanly, without interfering in the 
process of the elections. Now the duma is starting to work, and 
it will make decisions by itself. 
  As for the questions that we proposed that the duma 
consider--it does not have to accept them. Everything depends on 
the objectives that the deputy corps sets for itself. But we are 
not imposing them--let the deputies decide for themselves. 
  We are not at all striving to have a weak duma. The creation 
has begun of an organ of authority that is absolutely 
independent, with its own budget and with its own procedure for 
putting its policy into effect. 
  [Pankov] How do you intend to build your relations with the 
duma organizationally? 
  [Luzhkov] I want there to be regular meetings (once in two 
or 
three months) of the deputies with the government of Moscow to 
consider the general situation in the city, or individual 
problems. So that members of the government and the mayor should 
participate in the work of the duma as competent representatives 
of the executive authority. So that each member of the 
government should set aside a day to meet with deputies. So that 
workers of the executive authority should provide any 
information, reference, analytical materials requested by 
deputies.... 
  [Pankov] One more year is coming to an end. Was it easier or 
more difficult for you as the mayor than last year? 
  [Luzhkov] There are no easy years now. Each is difficult in 
its own way. The tension is colossal.... 
  [Pankov] But are you satisfied with the results of the year? 
  [Luzhkov] This is what I am not satisfied with. It was 
expected that 1993 would become the year of stabilization. But 
stabilization did not come about in industry (especially defense 
industry), science, the VUZ (higher educational institution) 
system, health services, and public education. We hope that we 
will achieve this in 1994. 
  I am generally satisfied with respect to the city 
administration. The promises that we made to Muscovites have 
been fulfilled. We promised to introduce 3 million square meters 
of housing, and we did. One million square meters of housing is 
for those on the waiting list, and 700,000 is being sold at 
auctions. The rest will go at normal prices to enterprises. 
  The construction complex has been maintained and even 
strengthened, and it is planned next year to expand work on the 
development of the municipal system. Everything will depend on 
financing. 
  The tension with foodstuffs remains, but nonetheless, it is 
not that acute. There are no more tobacco and other riots. But 
the calm here is deceiving. The Russian Government planned to 
take dangerous measures. For example, to increase customs duties 
for imported foodstuffs by 30 percent. This is being done 
supposedly to support domestic producers. But our agrarians 
reacted instantly: They raised their prices by the same 30 
percent. 
  There was a favorable extension of credit to Moscow for 
purchases of foodstuffs. It, incidentally, did not resolve the 
task of maintaining moderate prices in the city (Moscow is in 
fifth place in the level of prices and yields only to several 
northern cities). However, Moscow was deprived of favorable 
credits in September, and this will make the situation worse. 
  Given all of the expenses and failures (in the work of 
yardmen, for example), the city is provided with electric power 
and heat, especially after the introduction of the Northern TETs 
[thermal electric power station], work on the repair of roads 
has improved (in three years the volume increased by a factor of 
more than four!).... 
  As never before, a lot was done to strengthen the 
material-technical base of the law enforcement organs. Now it is 
only necessary to require the appropriate efficiency from them. 
  One of the most dangerous questions for us is rent. It is 
necessary to resolve it to support a balance of financial 
resources. It is an unpleasant question. But it is necessary to 
act more quickly.... 
  [Pankov] The year was also difficult for you personally: You 
were ill, it seems seriously.... Do you not regret that you are 
in the post of mayor as before? 
  [Luzhkov] I do not regret it. However, I have already said 
that I am not clinging to this position, but I value the work. 
  [Pankov] But would you not like to transfer to the 
Government 
of Russia? 
  [Luzhkov] Categorically not! I will work here as long as the 
Muscovites put up with me. It is better to do something useful 
in Moscow than to fail in Russia. 
  [Pankov] But if you are not elected mayor the next time, 
where will you go? 
  [Luzhkov] I will become a normal Muscovite, but I will work 
in the same sphere that I have worked in all of my life. I will 
continue to work on the introduction of new equipment. 
  [Pankov] The supposition has already been heard that you 
might become a candidate for president of Russia. How do you 
react to this idea? 
  [Luzhkov] Absolutely indifferently. And I emphasize: When I 
talk about the need to renew the Government of Russia, I do not 
have my own candidacy in mind. I do not want to go anywhere for 
a promotion. I feel that I am needed in Moscow. Something 
positive has begun to develop here. And I absolutely do not have 
elements of unhealthy ambition. Well, everyone should have a 
sense of personal dignity: A desire to work in such a way that 
you are spoken of well. Therefore, I did not run for the State 
Duma or the Federation Council. I am absolutely not interested 
in this; I have my own addiction--Moscow. 
  [Pankov] But if Zhirinovskiy becomes president in the next 
election? This will have an immediate effect on Moscow affairs. 
Who will stop Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Luzhkov] If things will happen normally in each city, in 
each oblast, and in each republic, then Zhirinovskiy will burst 
like a soap bubble. And so it is necessary to work, to make 
people richer, and to make Russians more worthy from the 
standpoint of their position in the world. Then there will be no 
place for any kind of Zhirinovskiys here. And there will be no 
need for a superman to defeat the dragon. 
  [Pankov] What are your wishes for Muscovites for the New 
Year? It will be the Year of the Dog. What, in your opinion, 
does this mean--a dog's loyalty or.... a dog's life? 
  [Luzhkov] The Year of the Snake, the Year of the Monkey, the 
Year of the Dog.... Why can we not live according to Orthodox, 
and not Indochinese, principles? I am not going to associate my 
desires with themes of a dog's plan. 
  I want Muscovites to be happy. I want it to be easier for 
Muscovites to live and for them not to be burdened at least by 
those troubles that our still unsettled city administration 
presents them. Happy New Year! 
  [Pankov] And to you and to your family, good health and 
prosperity and a good New Year's celebration! 
  [Luzhkov] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Aleksandrovich Belov, minister of </F>
press and information of the capital government, by Nikolay 
Andreyev; place and date not given: "The Minister Helps Those 
Who Help Themselves..."] 
  [Text] Leonid Aleksandrovich Belov, born 1947, higher 
education, served in the army for 23 years, worked as deputy 
chairman of the Moscow Soviet of the last convocation, and was 
recently appointed to the position of minister of press and 
information of the capital government. 
  The main conclusion I drew from my conversation with 
the new minister: He would be glad to help the press, which is 
suffering a financial collapse, but his possibilities are not 
great. So, poor brother journalist, as they say--the minister 
helps those who help themselves.... 
  [Andreyev] Leonid Aleksandrovich, I will not undertake to 
speak for the entire journalistic fraternity, but I personally 
do not understand why our Moscow Ministry of Press and 
Information was created. 
  [Belov] Our department is not an ideological department like 
the former division of propaganda of the party gorkom [city 
committee], which at one time was in charge of the media and 
adjusted their political line. On the whole, the ministry's main 
task is to provide for constant information communications 
between the residents and the government of Moscow. Muscovites 
must know about all steps and decisions taken by the government, 
and it, in turn, must adjust its socioeconomic policy taking 
into account the demands and opinions of the city residents. We 
maintain close contacts with all departments of the mayor's 
office and government and with the prefectures, we conduct 
sociological research, and we regularly publish collections of 
information on various aspects on the life and activity of the 
city. The mass media are a most important part of our work: the 
newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. And of course 
printing, dissemination of printed products, and the information 
and artistic arrangement of the city. 
  [Andreyev] Many new Moscow newspapers, including KURANTY, 
have ended up in an extremely difficult material position. Is it 
possible for them to count on any support from your ministry? 
  [Belov] By a directive from the top official of the 
government, Yuriy Mikhaylovich Luzhkov, benefits that give them 
a break on the rent for their premises have already been 
established for the editorial offices of all Moscow newspapers, 
including KURANTY. Our department is now considering the 
question of the possibility of reducing charges for electric 
energy for printing facilities, which consume a very large 
amount of it here, and this, of course, will have an effect on 
the cost of printing services and newspapers. 
  [Andreyev] All of the so-called independent newspapers are 
still dependent as long as they do not have their own premises 
and printing base. Could the Moscow government not make a 
goodwill gesture during these days that are so difficult for 
newspaper people: turn modest premises and a printing base over 
to them to be owned by them free of charge? 
  [Belov] I do not rule out such an arrangement regarding 
premises, but I do not want to get your hopes up: The market is 
the market, you must earn money and support yourself in 
interaction with commercial structures. Now about the printing 
base. It is in a most difficult position. The Moskovskaya Pravda 
publishing house, where the majority of Moscow newspapers and 
magazines are printed, is not owned by the capital but is 
federally owned. The money is pumped out of it and there is 
practically no help from the Russian authorities. For this 
reason the publishing house is unable to complete capital 
construction, make current repairs, or purchase new equipment. 
  [Andreyev] Why does the capital government not get the 
Moskovskaya Pravda publishing house turned over to Moscow 
ownership? 
  [Belov] This question has been raised repeatedly with the 
Russian government. The mayor has just received a negative 
response to his last letter. 
  [Andreyev] God forbid, but let us say that the Moskovskaya 
Pravda publishing house was over-strained and stopped 
functioning. Are there any alternative plans? 
  [Belov] We are taking all possible measures to launch a 
second section of the Chertanov printing base, but things are 
very tight with money. We are conducting negotiations with the 
Moscow Business Bank and foreign companies. Perhaps they will 
become involved in this matter. 
  [Andreyev] At one of the recent sessions of the capital 
government your department was given a good dressing down for 
poor street advertising in the capital. What a strange 
combination--the press and advertising. Is it really not 
possible to create a specialized advertising office? 
  [Belov] There is a state (municipal) enterprise called 
"advertising-service." The task of our department's advertising 
division is to develop and implement a standard advertising 
policy which would meet the three requirements set by the 
capital's mayor: It must be attractive, information-filled, and 
advantageous. And the main thing is that the advertising that 
interests Muscovites should be not only in the center, on Tver 
Street, but in all the administrative and municipal districts. 
Taking Western experience into account, we have prepared a 
concept of advertising and it will soon be considered by the 
capital government. 
  [Andreyev] For two years in a row with the participation of 
the Department of Press and Information winter evening balls for 
journalists have been held in the mayor's office on Novyy Arbat. 
Will this tradition continue? 
  [Belov] We intend to have another ball but we do not yet 
know 
where. We have to lease premises and find sponsors. 
  [Andreyev] Previously, Leonid Aleksandrovich, you were 
deputy 
chairman of the Moscow Soviet. Which position do you like better? 
  [Belov] I like better the lively, specific work which is 
conducted in the executive structures. You see the results of 
your work more quickly here, and that is stimulating. 
  [Andreyev] All Muscovites hope that the new organ of 
representative power--the City Duma--will not become a mini 
Moscow Soviet, that it will really think reasonably and calmly, 
but work effectively for the good of the city. What do you have 
to say about this? 
  [Belov] I too hope that Moscow will finally have a normal, 
effective representative power. But this can happen only with 
clear-cut delimitation of functions between the Moscow 
government and the Duma and also with the highest degree of 
responsibility on the part of deputies for the decisions that 
are made.

<F P=106> ["Charter of `Greater Europe' Commission"] </F>
  [Text] 
<H5>  Concerning the Idea of a Greater Europe </H5>
  Europe is not simply a geographical concept. Europe embodies 
a distinctive cultural, socioeconomic, and political 
understanding of freedom and diversity, individuality, and 
tolerance. 
  The question of the expansion of Europe's borders has down 
the ages been solved variously, particularly as far as the 
eastern borders are concerned. In Russia the debate concerning 
relations with the West, with Europe, in other words, is an 
inalienable part of the search for national identity. 
  In the times of the cold war one of the most impenetrable 
borders in human history ran across Europe. The "Iron Curtain" 
separated Central and East Europe from the process of 
integration that had encompassed the western part of the 
continent and postponed for a long time, both in the West and in 
Russia itself, discussion of the question of a commitment to the 
European principles of liberty and democracy. 
  The idea of a Greater Europe was born of the desire and need 
to take advantage of the truly new opportunities that have been 
afforded since the end of the cold war. 
  The idea of a Greater Europe has nothing in common with 
so-called Westernization--the expansion of Western influence. 
The European affiliation to the Christian world incorporates the 
most diverse creeds, including that of the Orthodox Church. As 
far as national and linguistic affiliation are concerned, in 
this sense also Europe is distinguished by diversity, with the 
Slavic component being a principal integral part. European 
culture cannot be complete without Slavic culture. 
  Nor is the idea of a Greater Europe an alternative to the 
process of European unification, which was initiated by the 
historic decision on the rapprochement of France and Germany. 
  Shortly after World War II, thanks to the decisive position 
of the most farsighted politicians, the process of the building 
of a new Europe with the purpose of overcoming once for all the 
legacy of the past began. This was courageous opposition to the 
past. And it has been rewarded by the peace, freedom, and 
prosperity that have reigned in the past four decades and have 
shaped West Europe. 
  New approaches to European problems, which are comparable in 
terms of their critical nature and uniqueness with those 
proposed 40 years ago, are needed today. This is necessary so 
that citizens of the part of Europe that was separated off by 
the Berlin Wall might as a result of the gradual clearing away 
of the impedimenta of the cold war be introduced to a peaceful, 
free, and prosperous life. 
  Proceeding from what has been said above, the idea of a 
Greater Europe is proclaimed and four specific proposals are 
advanced: 
  preparation of a Grand Charter of Free People of Europe; 
  creation of a Greater European Market; 
  formation of a Great European Cultural Space; 
  preparation of an All-European Security Convention. 
  The concept of a Greater Europe is thus an essential organic 
supplement to the idea of the European Union. 
<H5>  Grand Charter of Free People of Europe </H5>
  For the population of East and Central Europe 1989 brought a 
general awakening and a change toward the civil society. Despite 
many difficulties and the fact that forward progress will vary, 
depending on the country, a general trend toward the formation 
of a civil society--a society whose citizens adopt an 
increasingly critical attitude toward the government and the 
authorities--may be discerned, nonetheless. 
  But simultaneously with the collapse of the totalitarian 
systems a new threat to freedom in the form of aggressive 
nationalism, racism, and religious fundamentalism has arisen. 
  Both these processes--the change toward the civil society on 
the one hand and the revival of nationalism and intolerance on 
the other--are challenges to the very idea of a Greater Europe. 
Coping with them is beyond the capacity of the current 
institutions of European cooperation alone. Too much has changed 
since the time they were formed. 
  This is why a Grand Charter of Free People of Europe is 
essential. This would be a grand charter legally enshrining the 
unique situation, which has taken shape for the first time in 
European history, where people are free on territory from 
Reykjavik to Vladivostok. 
  The Grand Charter, as the constitution of a Greater Europe, 
should concentrate on the provisions that are fundamental for 
the peaceful coexistence of free people of Europe and should, 
thus, contain: 
  a list of the main human rights in the civil society; 
  the recorded status of minorities; 
  recognition of the commitment to observe the law; 
  a declaration on the need for control of the authorities and 
the separation of the branches of power. 
<H5>  Greater European Market </H5>
  Peace and stability in Europe will depend on the general 
well-being of the peoples. Building this well-being on the basis 
of the exclusion from the European Community of the needy 
peoples means sowing tension and military antagonism in Europe. 
  For advantage to be taken of the fruits of liberty obtained 
as a result of the struggle against authoritarianism and 
totalitarianism the speediest spread of economic well-being and 
progress to the entire territory of Greater Europe is essential. 
  As in the case of the movement toward the creation of the 
European Community, so in the formation of a Greater European 
Market also it is essential to be guided by a pragmatic 
approach, progressing step by step toward the goal and starting 
in the fields where results may be obtained most quickly by 
virtue of the greatest interest in success of all parties. 
  As starting points for realization of the idea of a Greater 
European Market it is essential: 
  to create a common energy community of Greater Europe; 
  to approve the main directions and timeframe of the process 
of liberalization of trade within Greater Europe; 
  to formulate an agreement within the framework of Greater 
Europe on the extension of inter-nation cooperation in business 
and to ensure the security of investments. 
<H5>  Great European Cultural Space </H5>
  The immense diversity of cultures is the most pronounced 
singularity of Europe. But there is that which is common that 
imparts to this diversity features characteristic precisely of 
Europe--an aspiration to individualism and pluralism and the 
struggle for these values, which, given a favorable confluence 
of circumstances, has led to success. 
  Following many departures from this line throughout this 
century, Europe is today once again moving toward a revival of 
its cultural diversity. 
  Profoundly rooted in European culture is recognition of the 
fact that the state cannot do that much for its development. 
Nonetheless, governments should contribute to the creation of 
conditions wherein culture can flourish. 
  With the ideological confrontation having receded into the 
past, there can be no justification for an artificial division 
by culture of the states that are and are not members of the 
European Union. 
  The creation of a common European cultural space 
presupposing 
the free exchange of ideas and artistic works and stimulating 
support for all kinds of cultural activity will thus be a most 
noble goal of a Greater Europe. 
<H5>  All-European Security Convention </H5>
  At the end of the 20th century Europe has found itself faced 
with the most acute problems of survival in the demographic, 
political, economic, environmental, and cultural spheres. The 
European Union is being challenged on the part of Japan and the 
United States in technology, finance, and trade; on the part of 
the Near East, North Africa, and Central Asia, in the cultural, 
religious, and demographic spheres; China is rapidly gaining in 
importance as a new economic and military superpower; and the 
so-called Asian tigers are challenging Europe with new 
industrial commodities and technology. 
  In this situation it is particularly dangerous for Europe to 
appear in the eyes of the world community as a disconnected, 
disoriented continent which is in a state of stagnation. 
  A new dynamic vision of all-European interests and a new 
approach to the problem of European security not only within the 
framework of the European Community, NATO, or the Western 
European Union but within the framework of a Greater Europe also 
is essential. 
  In the event of the concept of a Greater Europe being 
embodied in practice, the adoption of an All-European Security 
Convention, which would include the United States and Canada, 
will be essential. 
  Its two main goals should be: 
  assurance of peace in Europe by way of the adoption of a 
joint security pact which would be signed by all the 
participants; 
  defense of common external interests of European security 
incorporating not only the military threat but also an entire 
set of challenges of a civilization nature threatening peace, 
social stability, and freedom in Europe. 
  This text of the charter is not final. It may be amended 
with 
regard to the observations which, as the members of the "Greater 
Europe" Commission hope, will be offered by those who join in 
the debate on the Charter.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova: "Oleg Davydov's Foreign </F>
Voyage: The First Results Have Been Summed Up"] 
  [Text] Negotiations with both political leaders and 
representatives of a number of leading companies from Bulgaria, 
Hungary, and Germany were held during the trip to Europe by a 
Russian delegation headed by Minister of Foreign Economic 
Relations Oleg Davydov; the trip ended yesterday. The visit 
became part of a plan to invigorate trade and economic relations 
with the former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] 
member countries, which the minister announced a long time 
ago. 
  As Oleg Davydov said in a conversation with a KOMMERSANT 
correspondent, they succeeded in signing two protocols in the 
course of negotiations with Deputy Prime Minister of Bulgaria 
Valentin Karabashev: on trade and economic relations between 
Bulgaria and Russia for 1994 and on the continuation of 
cooperation in the area of development of the gas industry (the 
Yamburg field). Building on the agreements achieved, it is 
planned that negotiations will be held in January concerning the 
creation of a free-trade system between Russia and Bulgaria (a 
special working group was already established during the visit). 
The "gas" topic was dominant in the course of discussions in 
Sofia. This is not surprising. A special role is assigned to 
Bulgaria in Russia's gas exports: It is precisely with the help 
of Bulgaria's transit gas pipelines that Moscow is planning to 
expand deliveries of what is now its main exported product to 
Greece, Macedonia, and Turkey, and in the long run, possibly 
Yugoslavia. 
  As far as gas deliveries to Bulgaria itself are concerned, 
they will obviously become possible after the gas received is 
paid for in construction services provided by the Bulgarians to 
develop Yamburg (to this day, Bulgaria owes Russia for previous 
deliveries, and the overall positive balance of settlements in 
favor of Russia comes to 700 million transferable rubles). 
Besides, Gazprom representative Yuriy Zaytsev discussed the 
issue of Russia's participation in the conversion of Bulgarian 
gas transportation routes to joint-stock operations (this 
project has long been proposed as a scenario for settlement of 
the Bulgarian debt). 
  Other results of the negotiations in Bulgaria include the 
finally reached agreement on effecting mutual transactions in 
national currencies. If mutual relations with other former CEMA 
partners develop along these paths, this will certainly help to 
overcome the current crisis in bilateral relations caused by 
switching to settlements in freely convertible currencies only. 
To be sure, the issues of deadlines for the repayment of the 
debt denominated in transferable rubles and of the payment of 
the Bulgarian debt to Russian commercial banks denominated in 
foreign exchange remain unresolved. Negotiations on these issues 
will be continued on 24 January in Moscow and Sofia. 
  Unlike in Sofia, no breakthrough occurred in Budapest, and 
yet, according to Mr. Davydov, they still achieved some movement 
on the issue of debts. The deadline for the payment of the 
second segment of the Russian debt (totalling $1.6 billion) was 
resolved in negotiations with Minister of Trade Bela Kadar. The 
payment of this segment will be effected after 1994, whereas the 
first segment will be paid through military deliveries in 1993 
and 1994. The issue of participation by Russian companies in the 
construction of a subway in Budapest toward the repayment of the 
debt was also discussed. This project will be considered in 
greater detail at a meeting of the intergovernmental 
Russian-Hungarian commission on 24 January in Moscow. The 
Hungarian proposal to establish a Hungarian-Russian bank for 
trade and economic cooperation (with the participation of the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) will also be 
discussed at the meeting. The signing of a protocol for 
cooperation in 1994 is also scheduled for January. 
  The last four days of the visit were devoted to negotiations 
with representatives of the German BASF concern.

<H5>  Trade and Economic Relations Between Russia and Bulgaria </H5>
  In 1993 commodity trade between Russia and Bulgaria 
increased on account of Russian exports, amounting to $1.7 
billion. 
  Two protocols were signed during the negotiations: 
  --on trade and economic relations in 1994; 
  --on the continuation of cooperation in the area of 
developing the gas industry (the Yamburg field). 
  Negotiations were also held: 
  --on the issue of settling the mutual debt; 
  --on cooperation in nuclear power generation (in particular, 
Russia will provide assistance in servicing four Bulgarian 
nuclear power stations); 
  --on the issue of gas exports from Russia and its 
participation in converting the gas transportation network of 
Bulgaria to joint-stock operations. 
  Negotiations were also held with the chiefs of the 
Metallokonstruktsiya, Glavbolgarstroy, and Bulgargaz companies.

  Negotiations were held with the BASF company: 
  --on cooperation in the construction of the Novyy Urengoy 
Mining and Chemical Complex; 
  --on the joint production of plant protection agents; 
  --on the production of audio and videocassettes and drugs in 
Russia. [end boxed item]

<H5>  Russian-Hungarian Trade and Economic Relations </H5>
  Commodity trade between Russia and Hungary came to $2.5 
billion in 1993. 
  The issue of establishing a joint Russian-Hungarian bank for 
trade and economic cooperation was discussed during the 
negotiations. 
  Agreements were reached: 
  --on holding meetings of an intergovernmental commission;

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy prime minister of </F>
the Russian Federation Government, by Yelena Dikun, under the 
rubric "From the Horse's Mouth"; place and date not given: 
"Aleksandr Shokhin: Russia Has Accomplished a Breakthrough in 
the European Sector"] 
  [Text] The deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation 
Government commented on the outcome of negotiations in Brussels. 
  [Dikun] For the time being the Political Declaration of 
Partnership and Cooperation Between Russia and the European 
Union is not an agreement but merely a protocol of intent. Why 
did you not succeed in Brussels in signing right away the treaty 
that has been worked on for more than a year now? 
  [Shokhin] It was clear that only the declaration would be 
signed in Brussels even before the visit began. The point is 
that the agreement itself is huge, consisting of more than 100 
pages, and time is needed in order to bring about its signing in 
a purely technical sense. Individual issues were resolved during 
the negotiations--this is about trade in the products of the 
nuclear fuel cycle, the establishment and operation of 
companies, including banking companies, in the territories of 
Russia and the countries of the European Community. Experts will 
now have to work on these aspects, and then it will be possible 
to sign the agreement. The Brussels Declaration has removed all 
obstacles on the path toward it. 
  [Dikun] What specifically does this declaration accomplish 
for Russia? 
  [Shokhin] Russia is no longer considered a country with a 
centralized planned economy which is capable of setting prices 
and conditions for trade at its discretion, without reference to 
market arrangements. All measures are possible with regard to 
such a state in order to restrict its exports. As is laid down 
in the declaration, Russia has now been recognized as a country 
with an economy of a transitional type. That is to say that 
antidumping measures cannot be used against it for purely 
political motives; we will now be treated in keeping with canons 
and yardsticks commonly accepted in the world. If the issue of 
introducing a restrictive measure with regard to Russia arises, 
it should be consulted first as to whether the country is indeed 
deliberately engaging in some dumping practices, or whether 
there is another reason. 
  Besides, it is officially codified in the declaration that 
the European Community and Russia are partners from now on and 
will strive for further economic rapprochement. Moreover, in the 
immediate future negotiations should begin on establishing a 
free zone and trade between the European Union and Russia. 
  Simultaneously, the Council for Cooperation between the 
European Union and Russia is being established within the 
framework of which it is planned to hold summits twice a year, 
that is, meetings between the president of Russia, on one side, 
and the chairman of the Council of the European Union, the 
chairman of the European Commission, on the other side. It is 
also laid down in the declaration that intensive contacts will 
be organized at the parliamentary level. In a word, a continuous 
dialogue, a system of regular consultations will be established 
between the European Union and Russia. It is important that the 
parties stated this officially: They will build mutual economic 
relations on the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, to which an overwhelming majority of the countries of 
the world adhere. 
  [Dikun] Can the real economic effect of this agreement be 
assessed? 
  [Shokhin] It is impossible to quantify. In the greater 
scheme 
of things, establishing broad-scale political and economic 
cooperation with the European Union is primarily in Russia's 
interest. This will simplify and facilitate market 
transformations for us, and will relieve social difficulties in 
the course of reforms. One way or the other, this will give a 
great impetus to the participation of European companies in the 
operation of Russian institutions and companies. This will 
influence the progress of privatization favorably, ensuring in 
the process not only an influx of capital that we badly need but 
also the advent of new technologies and management expertise 
which we need so much. 
  This is very important: The European space market is being 
opened up to us. Everybody knows well to what degree the Western 
market for space launches and space services as a whole is 
closed, how difficult it is to break into, and what obstacles 
are being thrown in our path in this case. The number of 
commercial launches we will be able to carry out before the end 
of this century has now been determined. Subsequently, our quota 
in the space sphere is expected to be increased in keeping with 
our own potential, as well as so that prices for these services 
will gradually pull closer to world prices. This is completely 
in our interest because our prices for such services are 
somewhat below those in the world. Our entry onto the space 
market is also valuable to us in that it will promote the 
development of domestic industry and science, quite a number of 
sectors associated with rocket building and support for space 
launches. 
  [Dikun] As is known, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore also 
came here with a program for extensive joint participation by 
Russia and America in space projects. Therefore, Russia has now 
got an opportunity to choose. Will the emerging rapprochement 
between our country and the European Union prompt the United 
States to cooperate with Russia more closely? 
  [Shokhin] Undoubtedly, negotiations with the European Union 
concerning space which had been underway for more than a year 
urged the Americans on in this area. In turn, similar contacts 
between Russia and the United States caused more activity among 
the Europeans. That such a breakthrough has been accomplished in 
the European sector cannot fail to influence the American side 
now. The United States is developing cooperation with us in the 
space area gradually, but further and further; from just space 
launches, it is proceeding toward cooperation in the creation 
and construction of orbiting stations. As recently as half a 
year ago the Americans had very serious doubts about the latter 
project because this meant automatically that a proportion of 
the market and a proportion of the orders would be transferred 
to Russia. This meant that American producers of the requisite 
equipment would fail to receive the same share. However, by all 
signs the issue has been resolved in our favor. 
  [Dikun] Which problems did you fail to resolve in Brussels? 
  [Shokhin] First of all, regarding aluminum exports. 
Restrictions on imports from Russia to the countries of the 
European Union are still in force. In this case, the interests 
of primarily France, the main producer of aluminum in the 
European Union, were affected. Incidentally, coordination on 
space proceeded in a quite complicated manner because of France 
once again. Let us say it straightforwardly: On quite a number 
of issues France hindered the reaching of agreements which could 
be satisfactory to the Russian Federation. It is common 
knowledge that at one time the French came out as opponents of 
the agreement on partnership and cooperation with Russia, saying 
that it is not all that necessary for the European Union at this 
stage. However, this extreme point of view did not prevail. 
  [Dikun] To what degree did the edict of President Yeltsin 
concerning access to Russia for Western banks hinder the signing 
of the declaration? 
  [Shokhin] This edict changed our negotiating position. It 
was 
very necessary for us and extremely inconvenient for them. 
However, we understand full well that if one of the parties gets 
a greater advantage than the other, the latter will be left 
dissatisfied and will possibly try to modify the agreement, 
which, naturally, no one needs. Therefore it was very important 
to strike a balance on all issues during the negotiations, 
including those concerning banks. I will not dwell on the 
details of how the Russian Federation intends to restrict the 
operations of European financiers on the Russian market during 
the period of transition; I will only say that the restrictions 
we are introducing are not an insurmountable barrier to banks 
from the European Union countries coming to the Russian market. 
Although there is no complete agreement as of this moment, let 
us hope that one will be reached within a few weeks. 
  [Dikun] Did the release of a report on relations between 
Russia and NATO by the chief of the Foreign Intelligence 
Service, Yevgeniy Primakov, affect the progress of negotiations? 
  [Shokhin] Actually, Primakov's report aroused the interest 
of 
the Russian public to these problems. What had previously 
proceeded within the confines of big-time politics became 
available to the general public. In Brussels the position of 
Russia was clearly affirmed to the effect that it is not 
prepared to see NATO as an organization expanded into Central 
and Eastern Europe but without the participation of Russia. 
Moreover, the idea was voiced that the parallel admission of 
Russia and these countries to NATO preserves the balance of 
forces in Europe. Apparently this issue will be discussed in 
January during the summit of the North Atlantic Union. 
  [Dikun] Do you project the emergence of domestic policy 
obstacles which may frustrate the signing of an agreement 
between Russia and the European Union, for example, in 
conjunction with the election of a new parliament? 
  [Shokhin] I believe that not only the firm position of the 
Russian delegation but also the events that occurred in 
September and October were some of the main reasons for the 
acceleration of the treaty process in Brussels. European 
Community countries understand that it is unwise to wait until 
reforms in Russia are crowned with complete success and to begin 
cranking up the cooperation mechanism only after that. The 
situation here is quite fluid all the time, and for this reason 
everything should be done in order to speed up the reforms. In 
particular, the issue is to give Russia an opportunity to make 
money by way of its exports rather than count on external 
financial infusions. I believe that very shortly G-7 and other 
international organizations should take certain steps in this 
direction. Therefore, I do not think that the situation will 
somehow deteriorate because of our domestic events. 
  [Dikun] However, is it ruled out that another Cabinet of 
Ministers will complete this endeavor on the side of Russia? 
  [Shokhin] The reassignment of cadres in the government could 
have occurred without the election; the issue is how this 
government will work with this parliament. There are two 
possible scenarios. The first is to form a government which has 
a parliamentary majority. However, given this array, this may be 
Zhirinovskiy's government. This is why a second scenario is not 
ruled out--to take advantage of the transitional provisions of 
the Constitution whereby the current government will continue to 
discharge its responsibilities without relinquishing its powers 
before the newly elected Duma or raising the issue of a vote of 
confidence in itself. Although I personally advocated the latter 
before, I thought at that time that democratic blocs would be in 
a majority in the parliament. 
  Of course, some adjustments in the government are 
possible--not on the principle proposed by Zhirinovskiy, who 
demands that four, five, or 10 key figures be replaced, but 
proceeding rather from the need to win over for our side people 
from politically adjacent parties and movements. Their 
representatives will have to be included in the government to 
this end.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Arutyunov under the rubric "Commodity </F>
Markets": "Aluminum: It Is Tough for the Lightest Iron"] 
  [Text] In late November the European Communities 
Commission extended sanctions to restrict the imports of Russian 
aluminum to Europe. Last week the Decree of the Council of 
Ministers On Measures To Resolve Commercial Disputes Arising in 
Conjunction With the Export of Russian Goods was signed, which 
gave the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations the right to 
establish quotas and introduce licensing for the export of goods 
in regard to which the threat of the introduction of antidumping 
or other restrictive measures exists. Therefore, on the eve of 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Brussels, Russia demonstrated its 
readiness to comply with the European Union rules of the game 
and the GATT antidumping code. 
  However, in the opinion of the Russian side, this 
readiness will not solve all problems of the world market 
related to so-called "sensitive commodities" (a term of the 
European Communities Commission), of which aluminum is one. The 
way out of the existing situation is elsewhere--while continuing 
negotiations with the European Union, to attempt to come to an 
agreement on measures to regulate the market directly with the 
producers and exporters of aluminum. Russia outlined its 
position at a meeting of representatives of the Governments of 
Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, the United States, and the 
European Community held on 1-2 December of this year. 
<H5>  Russia in Search of Leeway </H5>
  In addition to official personalities, representatives of 
the 
industries of these countries, jointly with the International 
Primary Aluminum Institute (IPAI), took part in the first stage 
of proceedings of the multilateral meeting. Those attending the 
meeting thought that the simultaneous participation of officials 
and producers was caused by a unique concurrence of events on 
the world aluminum market. 
  Against the background of an overall recession in the world 
economy, a massive discharge of aluminum on the world market 
occurred in the early 1990's, and prices for the metal declined 
to the level of eight years ago. Now, overproduction (including 
reserves) of primary aluminum in the world comes to 1.5 to 2 
million tonnes annually. Although the conference was not crowned 
with the signing of any agreement, the participants in it laid 
down their common position and submitted this document to their 
governments: Everybody is responsible for the overproduction, 
and, accordingly, cutbacks in production should also be made by 
quite a number of countries. 
  The representatives of Russia did not manage to obtain what 
they were counting on--the lifting of sanctions. However, there 
is still hope: The final document includes a thesis on the need 
to facilitate the transformation of the aluminum industry of 
Russia and CIS countries into a sector with full market 
orientation, as well as continuation of access to Western 
markets for considerable volumes of aluminum from CIS countries. 
<H3>  The Alyuminiy Concern: European Communities Commission 
Sanctions Are Bad Medicine </H3>
  KOMMERSANT approached Igor Prokopov, president of the 
Alyuminiy Joint-Stock Company, with a request to comment on 
current events; he had participated in the conference in 
Washington, representing the interests of Russian producers and 
exporters. 
  In his words, the position of the Russian side is based on 
real facts. They are as follows. In the last 10 years aluminum 
production in the world has increased by 4.3 million tonnes. 
During the same period, Russia increased its output by only 
200,000 tonnes. The difficult situation on the world aluminum 
market has been caused not only by the concentrated unloading of 
aluminum by CIS countries but also by the virtually unhindered 
penetration of inexpensive aluminum from Brazil, Venezuela, 
Australia, and Canada which has become possible in view of the 
active participation of a number of European and Japanese 
companies in investing in aluminum plants in these countries. 
This was precisely where the bulk of the increment in aluminum 
production occurred (see tables 1-3). 
  Mr. Prokopov said: "We categorically disagree with 
protectionist attempts to solve the problem of the world 
aluminum market solely at the expense of Russia, as the European 
Communities Commission is trying to do. First, responsibility 
for the poor market should be shared by all who had something to 
do with its condition, including West European companies. 
  Second, this decision in itself is erroneous, unpromising, 
and harmful primarily for metal producers. The decision has not 
brought about an increase in prices, nor will it: This decision, 
like poor medicine, neglects the sickness of the aluminum market 
even more. Prices are continuing to decline, export streams are 
changing: All of us are wasting additional funds for 
transportation and other services. 
  Third, it is impossible in principle to solve the common 
problem solely at the expense of Russia because in this case the 
operation of its aluminum industry should be shut down virtually 
in its entirety. For our part, we are ready for constructive 
work: Aluminum-producing capacity in the amount of 600,000 
tonnes has already been shut down in the CIS this year, of which 
a volume of 300,000 tonnes is in Russia. We are prepared to 
consider opportunities for further restriction of production by 
an acceptable margin on the condition that all the major 
producers do the same. 
  As far as Russian exports are concerned, as a chart shows, 
the volume of direct exports will come to 0.5-0.6 million tonnes 
out of a total production volume of 1.6-1.7 million tonnes. The 
rest will be delivered toward so-called tolling operations. 
Tolling, which amounts to processing the raw materials of the 
customer, makes it possible for Russian enterprises on one hand 
to utilize the available capacity, while on the other, to obtain 
the necessary working capital, because it is carried out on 
prepaid terms. Under the existing rules for world trade, 
sanctions for the growth of the volume of exports which has 
brought about falling prices are instituted against the producer 
country anyway, even if a foreign company acts as the customer. 
However, Mr. Prokopov believes this to be debatable: Since it is 
the property of the customer, the product of raw material 
processing is subsequently returned to him, and for this reason 
should not be considered part of Russian exports at all, as Mr. 
Prokopov sees it. 
  In the words of the president of the Alyuminiy Concern, 
Russia likewise cannot accept the accusations concerning the 
existence of some preferential conditions created for the 
aluminum industry in order to artificially make it competitive. 
The Russian aluminum industry has been integrated with the world 
to a considerable degree: More than 60 percent of alumina and a 
large amount of carbon raw materials are purchased on the free 
market (in 1993 about $1 billion will be spent for these 
purposes); in the process, outlays on the transportation of raw 
materials are quite high. 
  The second factor of price reductions--cheap 
labor--virtually 
does not influence the cost of the metal because its cost 
accounts for only 5-8 percent of total production outlays. 
  Finally, the president of the concern considers the main 
accusations (the artificial understatement of prices for metal 
due to lower electricity rates) to be likewise groundless. In 
his words, electricity rates for metal producers in the Urals 
and Central Russia are equal to those in Europe. On average 
Siberians pay more for electricity than Canadian producers (in 
that country, special coefficients for rate reductions on 
electricity for the aluminum industry exist), although less than 
in Europe and the United States. The latter is due to the fact 
that 80 percent of the aluminum in Russia is now manufactured 
using electricity from large hydropower stations, which is 
inexpensive in terms of self-cost. 
  In the words of Mr. Prokopov, the state does not provide any 
financial support for aluminum enterprises and does not regulate 
or control their operations in ways other than the 
standard--taxes, quotas, and the issuance of licenses. 
<H5>  Domestic Consumption as a Way To Solve External Problems </H5>
  Specialists attribute the actual augmentation of the export 
of aluminum of Russian provenance, which is indeed causing 
stress on the world market, primarily to reductions in the 
domestic consumption of metal in Russia. Even in better times 
for the economy such consumption was not in line with the level 
of development of the aluminum industry. On top of this, 
recently it has been falling steadily: The main consumer of 
aluminum, the military-industrial complex, is facing a crisis. 
  If the downward trend in domestic consumption were 
successfully reversed, many export problems would take care of 
themselves. Igor Prokopov directly ties the growth of domestic 
aluminum consumption to the volume of foreign investment which 
may be channeled to this industry. He notes that the aluminum 
industry is virtually the only sector that is already prepared 
to absorb such investment: "We are the only ones to not simply 
avoid falling apart in these years of perestroykas and periods 
of transitions but to maintain production at a stable level." 
  Speaking in Washington, the president of the concern noted 
that if funds were available, some of the capacity in the 
industry would be shut down for upgrading; thus, the volume of 
output would unavoidably decline. Investment could be marshalled 
to establish new metal-consuming production facilities, which 
would also facilitate reductions in the volume of exports. 
According to available calculations, the establishment of 
container, packaging, and construction elements production could 
boost domestic consumption by 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes a year. 
  This approach was received with understanding at the 
conference in Washington, where it was ultimately agreed that 
the overall strategy at this stage should also include 
reconstruction of the Russian aluminum industry and incentives 
for domestic demand for aluminum products in Russia, in addition 
to regulation of production volumes (by all) and access to 
market information. 
<H5>  If Only We Could Endure a Year and Hang on for Two </H5>
  In Mr. Prokopov's opinion, resolving to substantially 
restrict the world output of aluminum for the year or two to 
come is a mandatory condition for a real improvement in the 
situation on the aluminum market. Such a decision may only be 
made within the framework of a multilateral agreement with the 
participation of all the main countries producing this metal. He 
stated: "At any rate, we will vigorously defend our place in the 
market as one of the largest producers of aluminum. At the same 
time, with the consent of the government, we are prepared to 
embark on developing measures aimed at the temporary 
self-restriction of aluminum production." 
  In the process, the need for coordination will persist in 
the 
future, when the issue of recommissioning the laid-off capacity 
arises after the accumulated commodity surplus has been 
absorbed. However, the market itself will then be able to act as 
the principal regulator of production; producers of metal whose 
costs are the highest will still have to restrict their output. 
  For now, the main hopes are attached to the final round of 
the multilateral conference on aluminum which will be held on 
18-19 January 1994 in Brussels.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX--SEGODNYA report: "Foreign Companies Have Invested </F>
$7 Billion Into the Russian Economy; 60 Percent of the Investors 
Are German Companies"] 
  [Text] The acceleration of the process of privatizing 
Russia's large industrial enterprises, including those in the 
fuels and power generation and the military-industrial 
complexes, assumes an increased foreign investment in privately 
owned and joint-stock companies. The improved legislation, which 
gives foreign investors the right to participate in 
privatization on a par with Russian citizens, should, in the 
opinion in government experts, stimulate an increased inflow of 
foreign capital into the Russian economy. The prime minister of 
the Russian Federation is expected at any time to sign a 
proposal drafted by the Russian Federation Committee on the 
Administration of State Property [GKI], which gives foreign 
investors the right to buy privatization vouchers and exchange 
them for stock of enterprises without the concurrence of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Finance (actually, even before, 
this requirement had been a mere formality). 
  In the estimation of government experts, foreign investment 
into the economies of Russia and the former USSR republics, 
including joint enterprises, by the fall of 1993 amounted to 
only $7 billion. German companies comprise 60 percent of the 
foreign investors, and Italian--20 percent; Austria, 
Netherlands, and Belgium account for 10 percent, United 
States--5 percent, Great Britain--2 percent, and the countries 
of the Far East (Japan, Korea, and China) account for the 
remaining 3 percent. This is due primarily to the fact that the 
Germans began to penetrate the Russian market and form joint 
enterprises with Russia much earlier than representatives of 
other countries. According to GKI data, lately German companies 
give a priority in capital investment to the chemical industry, 
as well as machine building and food processing. 
  The Zellstoff und Papier company purchased 30 percent of the 
stock of Zhukovskiy refrigeration plant. The company plans to 
invest $2.03 million into the plant's development. The 
Termozvukoizolyatsinnyye Izdeliya plant (Krasnoyarsk) sold 35 
percent of its charter capital. The bid winner--the Knauf 
Verwaltungsgesellchaft Iphofen--will invest 7.535 million German 
marks [DM] into the plant. The Ceziwid Elektrowarme GmbH company 
purchased 30 percent of stock of the Podolsk refractories plant. 
The investment will amount to $1.2 million. German 
electrotechnical giant Siemens acquired 10 percent of the 
charter capital of Kaluzhskiy Turbinnyy Zavod joint-stock 
company, which produces 50 percent of the turbines on the 
territory of the former USSR. According to the auction terms, 
the concern will supply the plant with DM2 million worth of 
equipment for the reconstruction of two shops. A major German 
company, Kautschuk Gesellshaft GmbH, purchased for privatization 
vouchers a block of 19 percent of stock (at the cost of 91.795 
million rubles) of one of the oldest enterprises in Tula 
Oblast--Yefremovskiy Zavod Synteticheskogo Kauchuka. According 
to the auction terms, the Kautschuk Gesellshaft GmbH company, 
which has been working with the plant for about five years, is 
to invest in its development DM1.48 million within four months 
from the date that the deal is registered. 
  Italian firms prefer to set up joint enterprises with Russia 
in the area of construction and construction materials 
production. In the opinion of experts, Italian investors coming 
into the Russian market are predominantly small and medium-sized 
firms. 
  The United States began their penetration of the Russian 
market considerably later than the Germans and Italians--in 
1992. They invest money in a variety of national-economic 
sectors--chemical, tobacco, mining, and electronics. 
  The American tobacco company Philip Morris acquired at an 
investment auction a block of 20 percent of stock of the 
Krasnodar tobacco factory. According to the terms of the bid, 
$60 million will be invested in the plant's development over 
five years. American company Procter &amp; Gamble--one of the 
world's leading producers of synthetic detergents--acquired at 
the investment auction 14 percent of the Novomoskovskbytkhim 
joint-stock company (Tula Oblast)--the largest in the CIS and 
Europe producer of household chemicals, which produces 30 
percent of the laundry detergent in Russia. The company 
undertook an obligation to invest up to $50 million in the 
plant's development over five years. 
  Great Britain has been the latest entrant into the Russian 
market--since the middle of 1993. British investors working with 
Russian enterprises prefer to work with tobacco and light 
industry enterprises. One of the largest textile companies in 
Europe--the British company Illingworth Morris Ltd.--acquired at 
the investment auction a block of 49 percent of stock of Moscow 
factory Bolshevichka. The firm promises to invest $5.5 million 
into the factory over five years, to purchase new materials for 
Bolshevichka, to equip the factory with a new clothes-making 
production line, and to make its network of stores available for 
selling the goods produced by Bolshevichka.

<F P=106> [Article by Yakov Plyays: "Captive of the Bloc Struggle: </F>
Foreign Policy of the New Russia in the Programs of the Election 
Blocs Represented in the Parliament of the Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] The Agrarian Party, Women of Russia, the DPR 
[Democratic Party of Russia], and the PRES [Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord] mustered fewer votes than the others and 
either have none at all or have very inadequate foreign policy 
concepts. Women of Russia speak in their program merely about a 
strengthening of the "international authority of Russia and the 
development of equal mutually profitable cooperation with the 
CIS countries and other foreign states in the interests of 
stability, peace, and security." 
  The PRES has a more extensive program, but it also is very 
general and abstract. While advocating a union of the peoples of 
the former USSR and East Europe which gravitate toward one 
another and the development within the framework of the CIS of 
"confederative relations," the PRES at the same time believes 
that Russia's foreign policy should be that of a "great world 
power" and that the country should rely on its own efforts and 
proceed from its own national interests. It is hard to raise any 
objection to such assertions. But are the goals that have been 
formulated realistic and attainable in the foreseeable future? 
Hardly. 
  According to the DPR's program, "foreign policy should 
support the realization of our economic interests," and 
"Russia's political influence should be directed toward a 
strengthening of the positions of our enterprises on overseas 
markets, increased exports, the lifting of discriminatory 
barriers, and a strengthening of trade and economic relations." 
Like all the other parties and blocs, the DPR did not overlook 
the problem of the CIS. Travkin's party puts the building of 
integration relations within the framework of the Commonwealth 
in the first circle of its interests. And this is as far as it 
all goes. Which, objectively, is little enough for so notable a 
party in Russian political life as the DPR. Little enough, but 
still more than with the Agrarian Party, in whose program a 
foreign policy section is lacking altogether. 
  When interpreting the foreign policy sections of the above 
blocs, several questions involuntarily arise. What position will 
they hold in parliament, for example, during the discussion and, 
particularly, during the adoption of decisions on foreign policy 
matters? Or will they not be chess figures that are manipulated 
in their own interests by stronger rivals or leaders? These and 
similar questions are far from far-fetched, particularly if the 
overall alignment of forces in the future parliament is 
considered. And it is such that the end result could be 
influenced appreciably by the fluctuations of even small blocs 
or factions, not to mention their joint appearance on someone or 
other's side. 
  In offering the electorate its program the Russia's Choice 
bloc clearly proceeded from the foreign policy doctrine of 
Russia published back in spring of this year. This coincidence 
is not fortuitous, of course. If only because if was from this 
bloc that Andrey Kozyrev, the present head of Russia's Foreign 
Ministry, ran for deputy. 
  Although new points appeared in the Russia's Choice foreign 
policy platform--policy in respect to the "near abroad" is 
clearer and more detailed, for example--on the whole, the 
overall thrust of the doctrine remains unchanged. But however 
much we would like as soon as possible to become affiliated to 
the liberal-democratic world and to resemble it, this will not 
happen in the foreseeable future. Not because the path leading 
here is long and thorny, but mainly because the particular 
features of Russia and the mentality of its people (NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA has well-foundedly addressed this subject repeatedly) do 
not permit this. If we proceed from this, the overall policy of 
Russia's Choice, including its foreign policy course, is wrong 
and must for this reason inevitably go bankrupt. Judging by the 
events of 1993, the final months particularly, the results of 
the Duma elections included, resistance to this policy has been 
growing constantly and assuming new, increasingly serious forms. 
In the new parliament this resistance will be great and will 
intensify rapidly, including in the foreign policy sphere. A 
serious struggle under conditions where no force is clearly 
preponderant will enable some populist, in fact, dangerous 
extremist figures, representatives of the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] in particular, to attract some 
deputies and a part of society that is even bigger than prior to 
the elections. 
  The foreign policy doctrine of the LDPR is the direct 
opposite of all the others. Its main feature is aggressiveness, 
more, unconcealed bellicosity, which is atypical of all the 
other programs. This needs no proof. 
  Although the foreign policy part of the program of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation is not as extensive or 
developed as with Russia's Choice, the LDPR, and YABLoko 
[Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc], it exists, nonetheless. But 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has simply been 
unable to abandon the class approach or the ideological 
blinders. This is manifested if only in the evaluation of the 
most important factors that characterize today's international 
relations. And at the same time, however, a renunciation of the 
overemphasis on ideology characteristic, in particular, of the 
Soviet period and the at times unjustified geopolitical 
pretensions connected with it is considered an essential element 
of Russia's foreign policy. 
  The foreign policy part of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin 
bloc 
would seem to be the one which is most balanced and appropriate 
to domestic and international conditions. It is evident 
throughout that it was written by an experienced and competent 
hand. 
  A special section of the program is devoted to relations 
within the framework of the CIS, which is entirely justified. 
Declaring that this sphere is the priority of Russian foreign 
policy, YABLoko goes on to note that the purpose of the bloc is 
the "all-around (economic, cultural, defense) integration of the 
former Union republics exclusively on a voluntary basis." 
  YABLoko's program has not lost sight of any in any way 
important direction of foreign policy. While rightly observing 
that "the foreign policy of the new Russia should be as 
pragmatic as possible," YABLoko emphasizes attention to the fact 
that "Russia's geopolitical position requires Russian foreign 
policy's equivalent attention to Europe, the United States, 
Central and South Asia, and the Far East." The program 
formulates precisely the principles of the country's foreign 
policy and its goals and priority and long-term tasks. The 
particular efforts of Russian diplomacy, YABLoko believes, 
should be geared to the molding of foreign policy support for 
the economic transformations in the country and the promotion of 
Russian goods and services on foreign markets and the 
integration of our economy in the world economy on an equal, 
mutually beneficial basis. 
  Within the framework of its overall strategy YABLoko 
advocates partnership with the West, but on the basis of a sober 
balance of the interests and possibilities of both sides. "Our 
interests," the program says, in part, "largely coincide. The 
current differences determined by the specifics of geopolitical 
interests and national and cultural traditions are natural and 
are not of an antagonistic nature. They can and should be 
overcome exclusively by way of political consultations, with an 
explanation and defense of our particular position." 
  Russia is entering, if it has not already entered, a 
qualitatively new period of its development, which will 
undoubtedly make a strong impression on its foreign policy. In 
the new situation there is a very great probability that it is 
foreign policy that will be the object of fierce and 
uncompromising struggle between the parliamentary blocs or their 
captive. 
  The tremendous difference in the programs of the election 
blocs will contribute to this to a considerable extent and will 
hardly disappear with time. The contrary, rather, an 
uncompromising struggle in parliament, for which many deputies 
are already attuned, will harden the adversaries even more.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with heads of diplomatic missions </F>
accredited to Moscow; places and dates not given: "Our 
Questionnaire"] 
  [Text] 
  [begin boxed item] 
  Just before the New Year the editorial office posed two 
questions to heads of diplomatic missions accredited to Moscow: 
  1. In your opinion, what event in the past year best 
characterizes the relations of your country with Russia? 
  2. What prospects do you see for our bilateral 
relations in 1994? 
  Here are the answers of our esteemed diplomats. 
  [end boxed item] 
<H3>  Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ambassador Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary of Ukraine: "I Hope That the Ice Will Melt..." </H3>
  1. In the sequence of events, it is difficult to identify 
one 
that most clearly characterizes the relations of Ukraine and 
Russia in the past year. In my opinion, several could make up 
the general background. The joint participation of our sailors 
in peacemaking operations in the Georgian port of Poti. Those 
days demonstrated: We were together, and we will remain 
together. And we are always ready to help others. The same sense 
of mutual aid characterized the actions of our sailors who saved 
Russians near Zmiyinyy Island in the Black Sea. And on the part 
of Russia, specialists from the State Committee for Affairs of 
Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Elimination of Natural 
Disasters instantly offered help and assistance to those who 
suffered during the colossal flash flood in Transcarpathia. All 
these events, as you see, are of an emergency nature, but it is 
exactly in such moments that relations between people and 
nations reveal themselves in a special way. 
  And another sad event. Ivan Kozlovskiy, the great singer of 
the Land, passed away. Prominent cultural figures from Ukraine 
and Russia stood in mournful silence at his grave. Kozlovskiy 
united our people. His death left a permanent mark on the souls 
of people, on the banks of the Moscow River and the Yenisey and 
on the banks of the Dnieper. 
  2. I hope that the ice will melt. I hope that we will 
finally 
be understood and that there will be an end to the groundless 
accusations that "Ukraine is deceiving the world." 
<H3>  Otto von der Gablentz, Ambassador Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary of the FRG: "We Have Learned To Give Meaning to 
History..." </H3>
  1. Our relations are so close that there is no one big 
symbolical event that characterizes them. Federal Chancellor 
Kohl, for example, in 1993 alone personally met three times with 
President Yeltsin in Russia. The ministers of foreign affairs of 
the two countries, Kinkel and Kozyrev, had 15 personal talks in 
the last year and a half. 
  But our relations are also characterized by the reactions of 
Germans to the stirring events that have occurred in recent 
months in Russia: the attempted coup at the beginning of 
October, the referendum on the Constitution, and the elections. 
We are intensively affected by the difficult path that Russia is 
taking to democracy, to contacts with the rest of the world, to 
a rule-of-law state, and to the market. We are accompanying it 
on this path with a sense of sympathy, and where possible we are 
rendering effective support. 
  2. I am confident that we will move forward to a definite 
stage on the joint path to building German-Russian relations. An 
event is scheduled for the middle of the year that has symbolic 
significance for this time. On 3 August 1994 a solemn ceremony 
will be held with regard to the conclusion of the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Germany. It will demonstrate that Germans 
and Russians have also learned to give meaning to the difficult 
chapters of our long joint history with respect and a spirit of 
mutual understanding. 
  In 1994 the cooperation between our parliamentarians with 
the 
newly elected Russian parliament will very likely occupy one of 
the central political places in our relations. It can contribute 
to the fact that Russia is taking root in the community of 
European democracies, which in the form of the Council of Europe 
have established a forum for themselves devoted to the 
preservation of democracy and the protection of human rights in 
all Europe. Incidentally, in the middle of 1994 Germany, taking 
over the chairmanship of the European Union, will assume special 
responsibility for the current efforts being applied to the 
expansion of relations between Russia and the European Union in 
the direction of real partnership. 
<H3>  Bakhyt Nadirov, Kazakh Charge d'Affaires Ad Interim: "Russia 
Is Our Strategic Partner..." </H3>
  1. In my view, relations between Russia and Kazakhstan 
cannot 
be examined outside the context of the problems of the 
Commonwealth as a whole and the mutual relations between its 
members. We were all part of the USSR. Including Russia and 
Kazakhstan. And in this sense I would note the startup of the 
second power unit of the Ekibastuz GRES-2 [state rayon electric 
power station]. This is why: It is a unique legacy, delivered to 
us from the Union. Representatives of all the countries of the 
CIS took part in the construction of this installation, but 
specialists from Russia made a special contribution. The 
capacity of the combined electric power system of our countries 
grew into a whole Dneprogas! We have already broken out of the 
habit of such concepts as international construction. But here 
is a real example for you: The power of the joint efforts that 
was born in Kazakhstan's Ekibastuz is in a condition to direct 
electricity to the Urals, Western Siberia, Central Russia... It 
is no accident that President of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
Nursultan Nazarbayev took part in the opening ceremonies, a 
person who has offered many positive ideas for the development 
of integration processes in the CIS. 
  2. As for the outlook for our cooperation, my attitude 
toward 
it is quite optimistic. 
  The adoption of the new Constitution of the Russian 
Federation is a chance for civil reconciliation and a chance for 
political and economic stability in Russia. But the fact that 
Russia is a strategic partner for Kazakhstan needs no proof. 
  We welcome the election of President Yeltsin as chairman of 
the CIS, and we hope that this act will serve to further 
strengthen the interaction of the countries of the Commonwealth. 
<H3>  Sumio Edamura, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary 
of Japan: "A Foundation for Partnership Has Been Laid..." </H3>
  1. Two main directions have appeared in our relations. 
  First--restoration of the track from which Japanese-Russian 
relations had been derailed as a consequence of the postponement 
of the visit of the president of Russia to Japan the year before 
last. Second, the active position of Japan as the country 
chairman of the Tokyo country summit of the "Group of Seven" in 
coordinating their activity on assistance to Russia. 
  These two directions, in our opinion, interacting favorably, 
brought about positive results. 
  As a result of President Yeltsin's visit to Japan in October 
a foundation was laid for the restoration of partnership 
relations between the two countries based on recognition of 
common values. Secondly, the Tokyo summit was concluded 
successfully. At the meeting that was held by representatives of 
the "Group of Seven" countries with President Yeltsin, a high 
evaluation was given to Japan for its active role as the country 
chairman. 
  2. I think that the main task is to be able to move our 
relations toward the establishment of genuine partnership 
relations between Japan and Russia, using the foundation laid 
during the visit of the president of Russia. 
  I would like to hope for a further continuation of the 
position for rendering assistance to the efforts of Russia that 
are directed at democratization and transition to a market 
economy and, simultaneously, at ensuring the reliable 
advancement of our relations toward the conclusion of a peace 
treaty with the resolution of territorial problems.

<F P=106> ["Fragments from Report of the Russian Academy of Sciences </F>
United States and Canada Institute `The Position of Russia and 
Its National Interests'": "Yearning for an Unattainable Future"] 
  [Text] If Russia manages in the foreseeable future to 
overcome the domestic crisis, this will not go unnoticed in 
neighboring countries. Many would necessarily prefer an alliance 
or simply close relations with Russia to the risk of independent 
navigation on the stormy waters of world politics and the world 
market. 
  This is a distant prospect of the development of the Russian 
state. But it needs to be discussed even now, when the process 
of the recognition and determination of Russia's national 
interests is under way. There is no doubt that it should not be 
a question of a desire to revive the messianic role of the 
tsarist or communist empire but of a strong and stable 
democratic Russia becoming an equal and active participant in 
the world community capable of performing a positive role in it 
and helping other countries resolve problems of poverty, hunger, 
disease, and technological backwardness and, most important, 
strengthen international security. The interests of a strong and 
stable Russia thus do not contradict any legitimate interests of 
other countries of the world community but naturally complement 
them. 
  Today, however, Russia is in a state of decline. This is 
seen 
overseas also. 
  Against the background of a contradictory attitude toward 
the 
processes in Russia there was recently an event that evoked 
neither a polemic nor a serious response in the country. In a 
directive to the foreign policy and financial departments, U.S. 
President Clinton proposed that Russia be classed as a 
developing state. This was done, it was explained to us, for 
purely formal purposes: to simplify the bureaucratic procedures 
of the granting of aid to Russia. 
  However the American side justifies its position, this is 
for 
us yet another reason for reflecting on the simplest matter: 
Where is our society headed? Do Russian politicians understand 
that the time allotted us for changes is not unlimited? That 
some of the results of the government's activity as of the 
present are, truly, putting Russia in the category of a poor 
developing country? 
<H5>  Foreign Policy: From Illusions to Pragmatism </H5>
  The seriousness of the moment being experienced by Russia in 
its international position is connected largely with the 
unpropitious combination of its progress toward full-fledged 
sovereignty on the one hand and the incomplete nature of the 
structural reorganization of the global system on the other. 
Although there is talk everywhere about the disintegration of 
the old bipolar structure of the world and of a return of the 
era of multipolarity, virtually, a certain military-political 
"sesqui-polarity" continues in the world. 
  At the same time the self-regulation of the global structure 
is in fact taking place, and its dramatic aspect is that not 
since the times of the establishment of the Versailles order of 
1919, probably, has Russia's participation in it been as passive 
as it is today. The difference being merely that at that time 
Russia was kept apart from an active role, today it is itself, 
rather, on account of many factors, late in formulating its own 
legitimate interests and long-term goals. 
  Meanwhile the situation in which Russian diplomacy is having 
to debut in many respects is distinguished by higher-than-usual 
complexity. The edifice of the "Yalta-Potsdam order" has 
collapsed, but international stability has not become more 
durable because of this. 
  A practice whereby the Seven have in fact become the source 
of the controlling impulses in the international system has 
taken shape; decisions harmonized by it in advance are assuming 
the form of UN statutes; a key role in their realization is 
being performed by the efforts of individual countries 
semi-independently determining the composition and scale of 
their participation coalitions formed on an ad hoc basis. 
Diplomacy under the new conditions is performing an important 
role, but the military component would no longer seem to be 
relegated to the background, as was the case in the recent times 
of the Soviet and American accords of 1985-1991. 
  Economics has become an effective instrument of systemic 
regulation. But as the old stabilizing structures have gone into 
decline, the natural boundaries of the efficiency of economic 
factors have been revealed also. Evidence of this have been the 
fruitless attempts to apply economic sanctions in the Iraq and 
Yugoslavia situations, as, equally, the forced use of force in 
Tajikistan, which had just about fallen apart under the pressure 
of intertribal discord, in the Kartveli-Megreli-Abkhaz conflict 
in the Transcaucasus, or, finally, in Somalia. 
  A whole school of literature developing nonmilitary aspects 
of international and national security had appeared in the 
preceding five-seven years in Russia. The result of the new mood 
at the political level was the adoption of a number of important 
measures to limit the omnipotence of the military-industrial 
complex. Also oriented from the outset toward continuation of 
this policy, with its characteristic predominance of a 
negatively skeptical attitude toward armed force, was the 
leadership of the Russian Federation, which encountered here the 
full understanding of its main overseas partners and world 
public opinion. 
  Events would have developed within the framework of this 
tendency, evidently, had it not been for two circumstances. 
  The disintegration of the USSR brought about a rapid 
increase 
in inherent conflict in all spheres of interstate relations in 
the CIS. The question of armed force immediately came to be at 
the center of public attention--initially in the form of a 
bitter political struggle "to inherit the Union," subsequently 
in the form of a debate on the capacity of each state to defend 
its sovereignty and the interests of the citizens against 
threats of power encroachments, which had for the first time in 
many decades become real. Such was the internal, Russian, aspect 
of the problem. 
  But there was, in addition, the international aspect also. 
Approximately on the frontier of 1991 and 1992 an understanding 
of the impossibility of regulating international relations as 
had been done under the conditions of classic bipolarity--by 
means of menacing actions and demonstrations--began to mature 
among Western specialists and politicians on the basis of an 
analysis of the Yugoslav tragedy and the war in the Gulf. A 
perception of the need for some quite serious and effective 
steps emerged. Decisions were adopted in this context on 
limiting military operations under the aegis of the United 
Nations in Bosnia and Somalia; on the "peace-making functions" 
of Russian forces in Tajikistan and Georgia; and discussion of 
the position of the great powers in respect to the civil war in 
Angola, which is once again threatening to affect the adjacent 
states. 
  All these disquieting trends are prompting another 
reevaluation of the military factor in international relations 
on the frontier of the new century. The yearning for a still 
unattainable future of "general freedom, stability, and 
prosperity" must not screen the prosaic conclusion (or working 
hypothesis) that the world of the 1990's, which has ceased 
to be regulated in bipolar fashion, is evidently experiencing a 
need for strong management to a greater extent, virtually, than 
the "Yalta-Potsdam order" from 1962 through 1991 had need of 
it. 
<H5>  Toward Recognition of the Russian `Self' </H5>
  Our country does not have manifest enemies, as the United 
States and NATO were for the Soviet Union. But it has 
simultaneously also been deprived of former allies, on whom the 
USSR could rely at least to some extent (India). Calls are being 
heard from Moscow insistently for partnership with the civilized 
part of the outside world. But this part itself has not 
determined either its tasks in a partnership with Russia or its 
optimum forms. The interest of the developed part of the 
international community in the Russian Federation is painted in 
negative colors, in the main: everyone knows more or less 
precisely what the new Russia should not be, but has 
very confused ideas about what it could and should be 
without losing national identity. 
  This asseveration should be heard, of course, as a rebuke 
mainly to ourselves inasmuch as no one can explain to Russia its 
status in world politics from outside. 
  There is no viable partnership based merely on a "pure idea" 
and declarations, and a legally formalized system of partner 
relations cannot emerge before Moscow clearly outlines the 
contours of its national interests. In order for a treaty to be 
durable it is essential to anticipate the emergence of 
nonconcurrent viewpoints. They should not be, of course, even 
potentially mutually exclusive, but they can and will differ. 
The task of Russian diplomacy is not propaganda of the dubious 
premise of the total coincidence of the foreign policy tasks of 
Russia and the progressive part of the world community but close 
cooperation on a reasonably wide range of fundamental world 
problems and assurance of the West's understanding of specific 
aspects of Russia's foreign policy tasks. 
  This formulation of the issue also presupposes, of course, 
great clarity as regards the essence of the phenomenon of 
postimperial and noncommunist Russia. It is reasonable to 
approach its conceptualization by taking Russia's geopolitical 
parameters as the starting point. What follows from the nature 
of Russia's interest in foreign policy revealed following the 
disintegration of the USSR? 
  It is understandable that Russia depends exclusively on the 
situation in the Northern Hemisphere, where Eurasia and North 
America are located, and the direct challenges to Russia's 
security lie in continental Eurasia. Europe outside of the 
former Soviet Empire would be in a state of stability had not 
the Yugoslav cauldron erupted in the Balkans. Germany and France 
(and also Italy, perhaps) could potentially embark on a gradual 
division of spheres of influence in the former Yugoslavia. This 
in itself would disturb stability in the European zone. But the 
affiliation to the Yugoslav conflict of the Islamic world, and 
that of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey in the future is not ruled 
out, could turn the Balkans into a permanent focal point of 
tension and a generator of the disintegration of a "united" 
Europe and NATO even. Contradictions between the United States 
and its European allies could reach a significant level. 
  Russia is not entangled directly in the Yugoslav knot, 
whatever is being said in respect to Serbia. But two unpleasant 
consequences ensue from the Yugoslav crisis: Europe will be 
mainly preoccupied with the Balkans, paying increasingly less 
attention to the post-Soviet geopolitical field, and Turkey, 
penetrating it more and more, will raise its international price 
quotation. 
  East Europe is an economic cordon filtering potential 
Western 
capital investments and also a political cordon for Russia's 
integration in the European structures: The opinion that East 
Europe is supposed to be there first has taken shape. It cannot 
be ruled out that the East European countries will arrive at the 
conclusion of a mini-bloc in this composition or the other. 
  The Baltic cuts off Russia from Scandinavia and Poland (not 
to mention the absolute vulnerability of Kaliningrad Oblast) and 
is of an anti-Russian frame of mind, on the whole. 
  Belarus, the country that is the most well-disposed toward 
Russia among the young states, has under these conditions 
acquired the role, entirely particular and clearly expressed, 
but not recognized in Moscow, of sole dependable link between 
Russia and Europe. 
  Ukraine could be both a most important ally of Russia and a 
no less powerful enemy. Even if common sense in the sphere of 
the economic union prevails, a real political ally has not even 
emerged as yet. Ukraine has in fact fenced Russia off from 
Southeast Europe. 
  In Moldova Russia's positions could be strong only in the 
event of reunification with Romania beginning to take shape. 
  Thus a picture wherein Russia objectively cannot perform an 
appreciable geopolitical role in Europe emerges (Russia's 
submarines could potentially keep the whole world in their 
sights, but this in itself would not restore to Russia the 
position of globally significant power). 
  That there is hardly anything that threatens Russia on the 
part of Europe is another matter. The loss of geopolitical 
function in Europe in itself reduces Russia's role also; but the 
geopolitical function is not an end in itself, it is vitally 
important whence the threat to the national interests of a 
country, particularly its security, emanates. 
  With the new alignment of forces it would be appropriate to 
consider as Russia's base reference point in relation to the 
system of geopolitical coordinates the deterrence in world 
politics of extremism. To the extent that the main habitat of 
their [as published] concentration is the geopolitical south, 
the deterrence potential should be oriented in this direction 
(although not in this direction alone). 
  Russia's geopolitical role consists mainly of deterring the 
Eurasian South in the broadest sense. The West, concerned with 
the defenses of the oceanic part of Eurasia, would not be in a 
position to render Russia the least effective support. But 
without a system of alliances Russia itself could do nothing 
either. 
  The "doubled," Eurasian, essential content of Russia's 
national interest predetermines the need for a carefully 
adjusted balance of the western and eastern priorities of 
Russia's foreign policy. The currently predominant 
"Europe-bound" course is just as unacceptable as the primitive 
prescriptions of the search for national interest in the 
thickets of "Russian-Tatar" antiquity. 
  The problem is that the possibilities of Europe are not 
unlimited even in the spheres in which it wants and is truly in 
a position to help us. European support in the surmounting of 
food difficulties and the modernization of the Russian fuel and 
raw material sectors is one thing. Actual support in the 
stabilization of the immediate surroundings and a strengthening 
of the regional security of Russia is quite another. In this 
sense Russian and "European" interests coincide in far from all 
things. 
  A durable alliance with Ukraine and Belarus is essential to 
Russia, say. But Germany has an objective interest more in the 
"dilution" of the western flank of the political space of the 
CIS, which inevitably presupposes a more or less lengthy period 
of its destabilization. The FRG has already realized a model of 
this attitude in the Yugoslav conflict, having gambled on its 
escalation. 
  Nor is there much in common as far as the European and 
Russian perceptions of the threat of Islamic extremism are 
concerned. As long as Russian forces remain outside of Russia, 
this danger will painfully affect Russian interests in the zone 
of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict, in Tajikistan, and in other 
former Union republics of Central Asia. Europe cannot give 
Russia practical assistance in deterring or, even less, removing 
these threats. Moscow's solidarity with Europe in the approach 
to regional conflicts is the equivalent of European solidarity 
with Moscow in far from all practical aspects. 
  That is, there is evidence of support as such, but it does 
not go beyond diplomatic and moral support. Because for West 
Europe the Asiatic challenges are abstractions in everything 
that goes beyond the framework of Islamic-Arab terrorism. And 
for Russia, thousands of casualties in the manpower dragged into 
senseless regional conflicts and real threats to the territorial 
integrity of the state. Euro-Atlantic thinking is not ready for 
participation in deterring these threats, nor does it have the 
necessary experience. 
  Yet the specifics of Russia's geopolitical location demand 
paramount attention in the sphere of inherent regional conflict. 
In failing to give them due attention now Moscow runs the risk 
of allowing situations which are no longer theoretical but which 
really threaten the European Russian "self" to arise. 
  There are just two ways to defend it--via reinforcement by 
other Slav components (Ukrainian and Belarusian) or via the 
formulation of a correct balance of interaction with the East. 
The first path is easier and preferable. But politically it is 
problematical. In putting undue emphasis on it, Russia would 
make itself too dependent on Ukraine and would lose time for the 
necessary development of the rational conditions regulating the 
degree of its selective openness to the East. Being boundlessly 
open to it today would be an archaism preserved since the times 
of the "indestructible unity" of Russians, Ukrainians, and 
Belarusians. And to the extent that this unity is now being 
disputed it is necessary to formulate a strategy of a 
strengthening of the Russian state "self," proceeding from the 
worst-case scenario--were the country to find itself head to 
head with the post-Soviet East. 
  Russia cannot simply fence itself off from Asia, as Poland, 
Estonia, or the EC countries can. Copies of the West European 
versions of the foreign policy line are no use. The most complex 
challenge is the need to formulate an active policy, preserve 
Russia's national identity, and strengthen stability throughout 
Western Eurasia. 
  It is understandable that this task is barely feasible 
without the support of allies and partners. All the more 
important is it seeking them among the countries really capable 
of supporting Russia primarily on questions of the deterrence of 
inherent conflict. If there is, indeed, anyone who may be relied 
on in this sense, it is not the EC countries but, rather, the 
United States--to the extent, of course, that Russia is at all 
able to enlist foreign states in the solution of such a delicate 
question as a strengthening of national security. 
<H5>  Lessons of the Conflicts in the Post-Soviet Space </H5>
  The problem of a reduction in Russia's presence in the 
regions directly adjoining the present national borders and the 
border of the former USSR may be considered the most complex and 
painful. It is obvious that Russia cannot carry the burden of 
the economic and military-political maintenance of stability in 
its outlying areas. Consequently, it is necessary to settle on 
the priorities and timeframe of long-term investments in 
Russia's national security. An estimation of such a modus 
operandi in accordance with the "cost-effectiveness" criterion 
is absolutely essential, what is more. These theoretically 
absolutely clear propositions have been observed in only a small 
number of instances throughout Russian history. Unfortunately, 
there are objective reasons for unavoidable involvement in the 
conflicts on the territory of the former USSR. We may put in 
this category: 1) the so-called Russian-speaking population, 
whose interests and security Russia has undertaken to defend; 2) 
the economic interdependence of Russia and the countries that 
are now its immediate neighbors. It is to the accomplishment of 
these tasks that we should pay attention primarily, evidently. 
Or sacrifice them in the future for the sake of as pragmatic an 
accomplishment as possible of the foreign policy tasks 
confronting Russia. 
  Russia has found itself involved in this form or the other 
in 
a whole number of armed conflicts on the territory of the former 
USSR. 
  In Tajikistan Russia is engaged in "peace-making" operations 
and ensuring the security of the state border between Tajikistan 
and Afghanistan in accordance with an interstate agreement and 
the mandate of the CIS obtained in accordance with the Treaty on 
Collective Security of the CIS. 
  In Moldova Russia's 14th Combined-Arms Army is engaged in 
operations to disengage the parties in the area of Bendery and 
the Left Bank of the Dniester in accordance with agreements 
concluded among Moldova, the Dniester region, Ukraine, and 
Russia. 
  In Georgia Russian subunits, in accordance with an 
interstate 
agreement, are exercising a peacekeeping function in the area of 
the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict. In addition, Russian 
forces have been enlisted in the guarding of the strategically 
important Transcaucasus Railroad. 
  The experience of the Russian Army's participation in the 
limited military conflicts on the territory of the former USSR 
makes it possible to draw the following conclusions: 
  (1) Russia is at the present time the sole state that has 
the 
military, political, and technical resources for undertaking 
military operations on the territory of the former USSR, 
peacekeeping operations included. In the foreseeable future only 
Ukraine and Uzbekistan can, in theory, create such potential. 
  (2) In the majority of cases (Tajikistan, the 
Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict, the conflict in the Dniester region) Russian forces 
were pulled into the armed conflicts by way of escalation before 
the Russian leadership adopted the decision to use them. This 
testifies that the mere fact of the deployment of subunits of 
the Russian Army outside of its national territory (particularly 
in areas where armed conflicts are already under way or are 
potential) inevitably entails considerable military and 
political costs. 
  (3) Russia's participation in the so-called peacekeeping 
operations could be associated with the active use of military 
force going beyond the limits of self-defense. From the 
viewpoint of legal regulation the approach to such operations 
should be the same as in the case of the use of force in 
interstate clashes. Unfortunately, the narrowness of the 
legislative base has been revealed in the course of Russia's 
participation in these conflicts. As a whole, the possibility of 
Russia's becoming pulled into military conflicts on the 
territory of the countries of the former USSR not as a result of 
an independent policy decision but by virtue of some 
international agreements and in accordance with a decision of 
supranational authorities, which at the present time is possible 
as a result of Russia's ratification of a package of military 
agreements within the framework of the CIS, should be completely 
excluded. 
  (4) Russia should state openly that it is not nor can it be 
a 
guarantor of the security of all states of post-Soviet Eurasia. 
It is essential to enshrine in legislation the provision that 
the security guarantees granted states of the CIS by Russia 
extend only to the field of interstate relations, not affecting 
internal conflicts or conflicts between countries of the CIS. 
  (5) Russia's participation in limited military conflicts on 
the territory of the former USSR will inevitably create two 
serious political problems, at least. First, a precedent for 
Russia's further enlistment as a "policeman" for the 
accomplishment of its local military-political tasks. Second, 
Russia's active participation in such conflicts could shape an 
extremely unprofitable image of our country--as the "gendarme of 
Eurasia." This danger is increased by the fact that in not one 
instance of the peacekeeping operations undertaken by Russia has 
it had a UN mandate. 
<H5>  Public Opinion and Russia's Relations With the West </H5>
  The West's loyal attitude toward Russia will remain in the 
foreseeable future a principal condition of the success of the 
Russian reforms. At the same time there is no doubt that the 
methods by which Smolenskaya Ploshchad has endeavored to secure 
a mutual understanding with the democratic countries are largely 
played out. We are talking primarily about the endeavor to 
persuade the West of the constructive nature of Moscow's 
intentions by means of radical concessions in the fields in 
which the advantages of the USSR, and then of Russia, were 
considered, conditionally speaking, not entirely legitimate. 
Among these concessions were positions that Moscow had acquired, 
first, by virtue of power and para-power ambitions (strategic 
arms) and, second, as a result of imperial aspirations. 
  It has to be acknowledged that this policy has, in a sense, 
been successful: The West has recognized in greater depth its 
dependence on the success of the Russian reforms. But 
simultaneously the line of the radicals in Yeltsin's team has 
had its drawbacks also. Raised on the idea of Russia's 
great-power status, the population of the country has perceived 
variously Moscow's new role as obliging partner of the West. 
  The disenchantment with the government's foreign policy line 
increased markedly when questions of the defense of Russian 
interests in the new independent states of the former USSR, for 
which the foreign policy department proved to be wholly 
unprepared, "suddenly" came to be within the jurisdiction of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  The pent-up dissatisfaction of part of society with the 
reforms in their radical version could easily assume and 
inevitably will assume, if this is not prevented, the form of 
anti-West protests and xenophobia. It is for this reason that 
the demonstrative emphasis of the unity and proximity of the 
Russian leadership and the leadership of Western countries, 
characteristic both of officials and the mass media, could at 
the level of the everyday consciousness, as before, be 
associated both with the West's incapacity for really improving 
the situation in Russia and with the reluctance of the 
president's team to probe the essence of the inherently Russian 
singularities of the difficulties which are being experienced on 
account of a desire "not to retreat one step" from Western 
standards. 
  The anti-American, anti-West mood today, as distinct from 
the 
recent Soviet period of our history (1985-1991), is an entirely 
significant aspect of Russia's foreign policy life. 
<H3>  Specific Features of Russia's National Interest in Relations 
With the Outside World </H3>
  A probable source of the indecisiveness of Russian diplomacy 
in 1991-1993 in the shaping of national tasks was the weakness 
of its scientific-analysis support. Another was the objective 
complexity of the process of recognition of the new position of 
the Federation in the international system. But the most 
essential reason in this respect in the recent period has been 
the instinctive fear of counterposing Russia to its Western 
partners, which could be explained also as an inability to 
explain to them the national specifics of Russia's foreign 
policy interests and to secure the West's understanding of these 
specifics and its fair attitude toward them. 
  One has the impression that Russian diplomacy is abandoning 
at every step the formulation of its own vision of this 
international reality or the other even when its Western 
partners are expecting and revealing signs of a readiness to 
understand this particular vision. The shaping of Russia's 
approach to the new independent states of the former Yugoslavia 
is the most striking example. It is well known that at the end 
of 1991-start of 1992 there was no unity among the NATO 
countries on the question of recognition of Croatia and 
Slovenia, which had broken away from the Yugoslav Federation. 
Germany was emphatically demanding support for Croatia, while 
the United States was referring to the need to preliminarily 
secure from Croatia assurances of its observance of a whole 
number of conditions. France adopted a guarded attitude toward 
Germany's opinion also. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry was practically immediately 
oriented toward unconditional support for Germany's viewpoint, 
which was manifestly at odds with Russia's historical policy. 
Russia's diplomatic recognition of Croatia came two months 
before the United States arrived at this decision. Yet it is the 
unresolved nature of the questions about which America's 
diplomats had been speaking from the very outset that have led 
to the protracted and bloody war. And this despite the fact that 
for the United States or Germany the question of relations with 
the new states of Yugoslavia is predominantly of humanitarian 
and economic interest, while for Russia it could be a principal 
strategic direction of its entire European policy. The 
Yugoslavia situation afforded an exceptionally propitious 
opportunity for acquiring experience for the championing of our 
particular vision of the situation while remaining at the same 
time within the framework of "normal" differences with our 
partners. This opportunity was let slip. And Russian diplomacy 
has simply failed in relations with its Western partners to 
master the "ethics of refusal." 
  The negative consequences of the policy of the passive 
"following of the West" are manifold. In first place is the 
disorientation of Russia's foreign partners in an understanding 
of the events and processes occurring in the country. Western 
politicians and experts on Russia could be forming an extremely 
approximate and superficial opinion of the extent to which 
Kozyrev's foreign policy line is contributing to the success of 
the reforms in Russia and how strongly it is provoking public 
disagreement with the president's policy as a whole. It is still 
hard for the West to appreciate the correlation between possible 
gains from support for the present "universalist" foreign policy 
of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the potential losses from it 
for Yeltsin's political base. 
  A second negative result of the present policy could be the 
Western partners' crisis of confidence in what is being said 
about foreign policy in Russia. The West has become accustomed 
to building its relations and assessments of the Russian 
situation on the grounds of assurances of Moscow's 
like-mindedness and solidarity with the Seven. It if turns out 
that this policy is in fact undermining the prestige of the West 
in Russia and programming an inevitable anti-West political 
tilt, Russian foreign policy will find itself in an extremely 
difficult position. It would hardly make sense for Russia to 
attempt to appear to the West better than it objectively can be 
today. 
  In general form the most urgent task for Russian diplomacy 
is 
to defend in relations with the world community its "right to 
specific features"--defend in such a way as not only to not 
intimidate the West but, on the contrary, to afford it an 
opportunity to put together, finally, a realistic idea of what 
the actual contours of Russia's national interests are. There 
undoubtedly are coincident and unifying aspirations of Russia 
and the West. The task is merely to conscientiously explain to 
ourselves and our partners their outlines. And simultaneously 
provide information on certain, most important, inherently 
Russian interests. These are: 
  first, assurance of strategic stability in the post-Soviet 
political space with interaction with democratic countries and 
within the framework of internationally recognized standards of 
foreign policy behavior and possible future accords in this 
connection with the United States and other interested states; 
  second, defense by nonmilitary methods of the personal 
rights 
of Russians and national communities oriented toward Russia, 
whose emergence in countries of the "new abroad" is historically 
connected with the existence of the Soviet Union and the share 
of moral responsibility for its policy which is inevitably left 
to the Russian Federation; 
  third, the elaboration of a plan of interaction with 
individual components of the Federation, partnership with the 
new independent states in the post-Soviet space, and a general 
vision of world economic and political problems which is its own 
and historically distinct, but which remains within the limits 
of the democratic and liberal models of social relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Velekhov: "Mr. Shumeyko Has Found the </F>
Golden Mean in Relations With Cuba; Now the Question Is Whether 
They Will Bring a Lot of Gold to Russia"] 
  [Text] The visit to Russia that was concluded last week by 
a Cuban governmental delegation headed by Deputy Chairman of the 
Council of Ministers Lionel Soto, without a doubt, marked a new 
Moscow and Havana rapprochement and, at the same time, a final 
rejection by Russia, apparently, of attempts to get "on board" 
in the anti-Cuban political situation. 
  The new rapprochement was documentarily consolidated in 
trade-economic agreements and in a general Russian-Cuban 
memorandum on the results of the intergovernmental negotiations 
that were signed last Friday. The latter was signed by Mr. Soto 
and First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Government 
Vladimir Shumeyko. Besides this, Mr. Soto and First Deputy Prime 
Minister of Russia Oleg Soskovets signed an agreement on the 
same day about the founding of the Russian-Cuban economic trade 
association Roskuba, whose founders on the Russian side are 
already prepared to come out with about 30 large domestic 
financial-industrial and banking groups, including the 
association Rosneft, Tatneft, certain Urals plants, a number of 
nickel producers, and others. Commenting on this agreement for 
the INTERFAX agency, Mr. Shumeyko declared that it "lowers the 
rank of economic and trade relations from interstate relations 
to relations between producers." 
  Mr. Shumeyko did not rule out that "the signed agreements 
affect the interests of third countries"--those who are buying 
up raw sugar in Cuba in order to sell it to Russia later, but 
now, naturally, at other prices, and those who for political 
considerations would like to hinder the rapprochement of Russia 
and Cuba. He added that he was not interested in political 
assessments of the signed agreements, no matter where they came 
from, and he expressed the hope that Russia henceforth will 
select its economic partners out of economic and not political 
considerations. "We have a lot in common with Cuba, despite the 
political disagreements, and we have found that golden mean 
which will make it possible for us to develop relations with 
this country that are mutually beneficial," Mr. Shumeyko 
generalized. 
  Indeed, Russia has already lost a lot of money by rebuying 
Cuban sugar from third countries. It also happened that Russia 
acted at the bidding of the interests of "still other" third 
countries--the same ones who, for their own political reasons, 
wanted to obstruct the Russo-Cuban rapprochement. And, for 
example, it shamefully abstained last year in the UN during 
voting on the declaration calling on the United States to remove 
the anti-Cuban embargo. 
  Thus, the obstacles in the form of political prejudices have 
been overcome. Not entirely, of course, because however 
paradoxical, the statements themselves of Mr. Shumeyko, as well 
as those of Mr. Soskovets, who declared that for Russia Cuba is 
the same as "the near abroad," contain a lot of superfluous 
political fervor and a desire to "rebuke" recent opponents of 
Russo-Cuban cooperation. 
  In accordance with the signed agreements, Russia will buy 
1.5 
million tonnes of raw sugar from Cuba next year (given an annual 
consumption of about 7 million tonnes and its own 
production--2-2.5 million tonnes). In exchange for this, it will 
deliver 4 million tonnes of oil to Cuba in two stages. This 
ratio is considerably less profitable for Russia than that which 
was planned originally--2 million tonnes of Cuban sugar in 
exchange for 3.3 million tonnes of Russian oil and oil products. 
It can be assumed that the change in the proportion is 
associated with the catastrophic results of the Cuban sugar 
harvest campaign, not the least reason for which was the present 
departure of Russia, which was retrieving its losses, with its 
equipment, spare parts, and diesel oil, from the Caribbean 
island. It can be supposed that Cuba should be advanced at least 
a little money so that it could restore its production of raw 
sugar, which has fallen almost by half. Only in this case would 
it be good to explain the change in the original conditions of 
the agreement, so that doubts would not creep in about whether 
Mr. Shumeyko in fact did find the golden mean. 
  There is one more result of the last negotiations. After 
they 
were over, Oleg Davydov, the minister of foreign economic 
relations of Russia, if one is to believe the television program 
"Vesti," made a statement for all to hear about the problem 
between the two countries in the form of the Cuban debt to 
Russia. And he even divulged its approximate size: More than $20 
billion. It seems that this was the first time that such an 
imposing figure had come out of the mouth of a highly placed 
Russian government person--it had previously circulated in 
unofficial circles and was refuted by the Cuban side and called 
a fantasy. This time there were no denials, and it could be 
assumed that this approximate figure "was adopted as a basis." 
Indeed, having reported it, Mr. Davydov then and there made the 
reservation that he understands that Cuba is insolvent today, 
especially with respect to such large sums. It is difficult not 
to agree with him, if one has in mind only the direct monetary 
servicing of the debt. But, after all, besides it, other forms 
exist. Why not address them and receive from Cuba on account of 
debt servicing not sugar, of course--otherwise what will it use 
in exchange for Russian oil--but citrus fruit, and the wonderful 
Cuban rum, liqueurs, and tobacco articles, long forgotten here? 
And is it not worth it in this case to wait a little with 
"lowering" Russian-Cuban relations from the state level to 
"producer levels?" It is precisely the state level that is 
necessary to resolve this problem. 
  But, in general, summing up: This new rapprochement has to 
be 
employed with discretion, so that it is not transformed into a 
new edition of an old friendship, which did not make either of 
the two countries rich. Russia has many interests in Cuba, which 
in the past two years have been abandoned and neglected and have 
gone off to foreign, tenacious, and solicitous hands. 
  And in conclusion, there is this apocrypha. When Boris 
Yeltsin in 1986 stopped over in Cuba on his way to Nicaragua, 
where he was going as the head of a Soviet party-government 
delegation, Fidel himself came to the airport to meet him, 
although party protocol did not envision such an honor for a 
Politburo candidate member. Castro liked Yeltsin very much; he 
looked after him incessantly, drove him around Havana himself, 
showing him the city--an honor that he had not bestowed on far 
more highly placed guests--and in the end he said about him to 
someone: "He is the only real Leninist in the present Soviet 
leadership." Well, then, old sympathies have now received an 
incentive for revival.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister of Kazakhstan S. Tereshchenko </F>
by KazTAG correspondents Amangeldy Akhmetalimov and Gennadiy 
Lunev; place and date not given: "Three Support Points of 
Kazakhstan's Sovereignty: Political Independence of the State, a 
Socially Oriented Economy, and Interethnic Harmony"] 
  [Text] On the eve of the session of the Supreme 
Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan our KazTAG correspondents 
were granted an interview by Prime Minister S. Tereshchenko. 
  [KazTAG] Sergey Aleksandrovich, one must assume that the 
implementation of the anticrisis program is now the focus in the 
government's activity. Tell us, please, about the course of this 
work, about the difficulties arising with its fulfillment, and 
how our ministries and departments can work harder for it. For 
we know that the president criticized them harshly for 
unsatisfactory activity in this area. 
  [Tereshchenko] You know, developing and adopting a program 
for bringing the country's economy out of the crisis is only 
half of the job. The difficulties lie elsewhere: how to 
implement it in such a way that people will have a concrete 
sense that production has started to operate with the required 
rhythm and products and goods have begun to appear on the 
shelves of the stores. Therefore in keeping with the president's 
decision in January of this year the National Council for 
Economic Transformations was created. It was entrusted to 
effectively monitor the course of the implementation of the 
anticrisis program. A calendar plan-schedule of immediate 
measures for implementing this program was also approved. It 
consists of eight sections, which include 163 points which are 
the points of departure for the program's implementation. It 
will be necessary to adopt a number of new laws and presidential 
edicts, to make a number of amendments to existing legislation, 
and to issue the corresponding resolutions of the Cabinet of 
Ministers. 
  Practically all ministries and departments, the National 
Bank, and also divisions of the apparatus of the president and 
Cabinet of Ministers have become involved in the fulfillment of 
the plan-schedule. The basic load here, of course, is being 
carried by the economic ministries and departments; they are the 
developers of all provisions envisioned by the plan-schedule. 
  During the time that has passed the National Council on 
Economic Transformations has held 11 meetings. The discussion at 
these meetings was about what we have done to implement the 
program and deepen the socioeconomic reforms. More than 70 
questions have already been considered. I wish to emphasize at 
the outset that the work is proceeding but not at the rates we 
would like. There are plenty of reasons for this: The newness of 
the problems, the instability and unexpected turns in the 
economics and politics of a number of CIS countries, and so 
forth are taking their toll. 
  A great deal of effort, time, and resources will have to be 
enlisted in order to resolve unforeseen situations related to 
the natural disasters in Atyrau, Western Kazakhstan, and other 
oblasts, and the difficulties in trade relations and the sphere 
of cash-monetary circulation. Of course the blunders in 
administration, the lack of coordination of the actions of the 
ministries, the mismanagement, bureaucratism, and red tape are 
also impediments. 
  In this respect the president's criticism of the government, 
ministries, and departments is fair. Unfortunately, problems 
arising with providing rural areas with petroleum products 
during harvesting made our work somewhat less active. But I am 
convinced that we have both the forces and the material 
resources to implement the anticrisis program. 
  The achievement of this goal is the objective of the 
president's Edict of 23 June 1993 "On Improving the System of 
Economic Management Organs." After its publication six national 
and 18 joint-stock companies were created and also 16 state 
holding companies. 
  The existence of these companies makes it possible on state 
initiative to regulate the transfer of state property to private 
hands through the creation of joint-stock companies and 
privatization. 
  On the organizational plane we have also regulated the 
interactions among all state enterprises, joint-stock companies, 
and corporations with the ministries and departments. 
  At the present time the Republic State Committee on the 
Administration of State Property is working to determine the 
proportion of the state block of shares and is developing a 
mechanism for control and management of state property in 
conjunction with holding and joint-stock companies. And the 
latter, in turn, are evaluating the property of the enterprises 
and organizations included in them, and they have begun to 
prepare for creation of joint-stock companies from state 
property and sell it through the privatization funds to the 
population for coupons. I think that after these measures are 
implemented we will finally succeed in getting the economy going. 
  [KazTAG] The problem directly encountered not only by the 
banks, enterprises, and commercial structures but also by 
ordinary residents is the financial problem or, to put it 
simply, money. It was aggravated after certain actions taken in 
Russia. Recently there seemed to be a new beginning in this 
matter. We have in mind the agreement on the creation of a new 
type of ruble zone. Tell us, will it be viable and what will it 
bring to Kazakhstan? We would also like to know your opinion 
about the introduction of our own national currency in the 
Republic. 
  [Tereshchenko] It is generally known what colossal efforts 
have been undertaken by the leadership of Kazakhstan to preserve 
the ruble zone and strengthen trade-economic and financial 
relations with Russia and other CIS countries. It was not easy 
to solve these problems. Nonetheless approaches to them that 
inspire optimism have finally been found. On 7 September in 
Moscow representatives of the governments and national banks of 
Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan 
concluded an agreement on the creation of a new type of ruble 
zone. This document confirmed the desire of the aforementioned 
countries to have a common monetary system using the Russian 
ruble as the legal means of payment on their territories. 
  At the same time it was necessary to regulate all questions 
related to the standardization of the basic principles of 
customs control at the borders, tax, banking, and currency 
legislation, methods of monetary-credit regulation, provision of 
free movement of goods, investments, and others. 
  The agreement stipulates the possibility for one country or 
another to introduce its own currency. If one of the parties 
intends to take this step it must notify its partners ahead of 
time and take measures aimed at preventing the movement of old 
monetary notes from its territory into the neighboring countries. 
  Another thing that is especially important is that the six 
countries that signed the document made a commitment to conduct 
a unified policy with respect to currencies of third countries. 
  Following Armenia, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, 
Kazakhstan also signed a bilateral agreement with Russia 
concerning the unification of monetary systems. This occurred on 
23 September in Moscow and I, responding to questions from 
journalists after the ceremony, emphasized that the agreement 
that had been reached would undoubtedly contribute to 
stabilizing the economy in our Republic. This is my deep 
conviction. True, it can become a reality if the parliament 
ratifies this agreement at the session that is beginning. I am 
convinced that our people's deputies will arrive at the correct 
decision after soberly evaluating all aspects of the situation 
that is developing in the new type of ruble zone. 
  Regarding the introduction of a national currency in 
Kazakhstan, I shall be brief. Our president has spoken about 
this repeatedly in recent times, and in particular he spoke very 
convincingly in Semipalatinsk and his speech on Republic 
television... I have nothing to add to this and I completely 
share the opinion of the head of state. 
  [KazTAG] The rupture of economic relations with republics of 
the former Union dealt a painful blow to our economy. Everyone 
knows that Kazakhstan is making active efforts to restore the 
previous cooperation and business partnership. This is not a 
simple process. What difficulties is the government experiencing 
in this work, why can it not seem to get things off the ground; 
after all, it would seem that it would be easier for economic 
managers to find a common language than it would be for 
politicians? 
  [Tereshchenko] I agree with you, there are plenty of 
difficulties and unsolved problems in the national economy. In 
spite of the measures that have been taken, the economy of 
Kazakhstan, like those of other CIS countries, is experiencing a 
difficult period. Traditional economic and cooperative ties and 
the system of monetary circulation and mutual payments that have 
developed over long years among the enterprises have been 
destroyed. The restrictions on importing goods that have been 
introduced by certain states of the Commonwealth, the 
application of higher customs duties and taxes, the violation of 
commitments that have been made for delivering the most 
important kinds of products, and also the further growth of 
prices of products have seriously complicated the economic 
situation. 
  The crisis situation in the economy of the CIS countries is 
the result of the lack of coordinated joint actions, above all 
in the financial and monetary-credit spheres. For example, last 
year the Central Bank of Russia unilaterally introduced standard 
correspondent accounts for settlements for deliveries of 
products and thus greatly complicated mutual settlements among 
enterprises. And this April this bank again unilaterally 
abolished the granting of technical credits and has now 
paralyzed all settlements through the correspondent accounts. 
  At the same time the government of the Russian Federation 
does not recognize the indebtedness of its state enterprises to 
Kazakhstan for products received in a volume of more than 200 
billion rubles [R], which was formed with the introduction of 
the correspondent accounts. The results are pathetic: Many of 
our enterprises for whose products there is a demand have been 
forced to halt production because of the lack of financial means 
for acquiring raw materials, processed materials, and batching 
items. As a result industry has fallen into the category of 
Russia's debtors. 
  It is no secret to anyone that from the moment of the 
formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States Kazakhstan 
has persistently defended the need for preservation of a unified 
economic space, integration of the Republic economy, and the 
establishment of coordinating structures and interstate bank and 
payment and customs unions. 
  The proposals from Nursultan Abishevich regarding this (he 
even allowed the possibility of creating superethnic 
coordinating organs) were not supported by certain states. But 
time showed the expediency of creating such organs, and a 
coordination-consultation committee of the Commonwealth was 
formed at the beginning of this year. In April, again at the 
insistence of our president, the heads of the CIS states agreed 
on conditions for closer integration of the economies, and in 
May they signed the Moscow declaration on the need to create an 
Economic Union. One might say that it was not until after this 
time that the agreements reached within the framework of the CIS 
began to be filled with real meaning and content. 
  At the present time we already have the agreement on the 
creation of the Economic Union of the Community, signed on 24 
September in Moscow, and it is open to other states. 
  After ratification by the parliaments of the participating 
countries the agreement will make it possible to resolve many 
problems related to effective functioning of the economic space, 
to create conditions for free movement of goods, services, work 
force, and capital, to conduct a coordinated policy in the 
monetary-credit and currency spheres, to organize interstate 
settlements, and to remove or gradually equalize customs duties 
and tariffs. It has also reflected questions of the 
implementation of a coordinated antimonopoly policy, the 
coordination of foreign economic activity, the application of 
measures of economic accountability of states for failure to 
fulfill intergovernmental agreements, and so forth. 
  At the same time, the Republic government is looking for 
principally new forms of interrelations and ways of placing 
commodity producers in close contact with one another. On 
Kazakhstan's initiative meetings were organized among leaders of 
the most important branches of the national economies of the CIS 
countries: in Surgut--petroleum workers, Akmol--agrarians, and 
Karaganda--industrial workers. These were conducted with the aim 
of improving interstate relations among these complexes, 
creating a unified market, and providing for mutual deliveries. 
The corresponding coordination councils were established. 
  Today we are trying to bring new content to our relations 
with all states of the former Union, and above all with the 
Russian Federation. Thus in March 1992 in Uralsk there was the 
first meeting of the full complement of heads of the governments 
of the two countries where they adopted joint decisions 
regarding many vitally important issues. The implementation of 
these decisions made it possible to save the harvest last year. 
These meetings then became a regular occurrence. 
  Special attention is being devoted to the preservation and 
development of mutually advantageous ties with the neighboring 
regions of Russia. This year there have been two meetings of 
governments in Omsk and one in Kokchetav with the participation 
of the heads of the administrations of 20 adjacent oblasts of 
Kazakhstan and Russia. Direct ties were established for trade 
and economic cooperation with the administrations of Khabarovsk 
Kray, Irkutsk, Saratov, Vologoda, Sverdlovsk, Tyumen, and other 
oblasts, the republics of Bashkortostan and Sakha (Yakutia), and 
the Moscow mayor's office. The Nizhniy Novgorod-Taldykorgan and 
St. Petersburg-Almaty trading houses have been organized and are 
functioning. Taking into account the prospects for this kind of 
cooperation where the initiative proceeds from below, the 
government intends to continue such work with the regions in the 
future as well. 
  Since the subject has already come around to Russia I cannot 
but say a couple of words about recent events in Moscow. All 
citizens of Kazakhstan have been following them with alarm. And 
one can now state with satisfaction that the provocative actions 
of the destructive forces that led to the bloodshed have been 
resolutely halted. This inspires hope that Russia will not stray 
from the democratic path. And this is also in keeping with the 
basic interests of citizens of Kazakhstan. 
  Over the centuries the destinies of the peoples of Russia 
and 
Kazakhstan have been inseparably intertwined in a close bond 
that cannot be severed. The policy now being conducted by the 
leaders of the two countries is also aimed at preserving and 
developing good-neighbor relations. Our agreements of recent 
times are beginning to be filled with living content that is 
working for the good of the people. 
  As usual, we are maintaining stable relations with Ukraine, 
Belarus, and the states of Central Asia. Recently the rates of 
integration processes have increased, particularly with 
Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. During a recent meeting of Presidents 
N.A. Nazarbayev and I.A. Karimov and agreement was signed 
concerning measures for deepening economic integration of the 
two countries during 1994-2000. It is intended to sign the same 
kind of agreement with the Kyrgyz Republic. 
  We are hoping that these processes will continue to develop. 
  [KazTAG] And now a question about our daily bread. The 
harvesting is being completed on the virgin land and from the 
looks of things the crops were fairly good. What measures is the 
government taking to fill our granaries with grain as it did 
last year? 
  [Tereshchenko] At the present time harvesting work is 
continuing in all oblasts of Kazakhstan. Here I have in mind not 
only the grain crops, but also the harvesting of industrial 
crops, vegetables, and potatoes, and the procurement of feeds. 
  Indeed, the crops on the virgin fields have now formed and 
they are expected to be just as good as last year's. But nature 
has made its own adjustments. Because of the frequent rains and 
cool weather at the end of August the ripening of grains was 
prolonged somewhat and therefore the harvesting of grain crops 
was postponed for almost two weeks. 
  And now the harvest is being held up because of the 
unstable, 
severe weather, and snow has even fallen in certain oblasts. As 
a result, the volumes that were to be received from threshing 
grain per hectare turned out to be 2-3 quintals less. In order 
for the losses not to increase it is necessary to complete the 
harvesting of cereal crops as quickly as possible. 
  Before the harvest the government rendered a considerable 
amount of financial aid to the rural areas. The commodity 
producers were given an interest-free advance of R120 billion 
before the harvest. Credit for preparing technical equipment for 
harvesting amounted to R300 billion. Now another R140 billion 
has been found for laying in the grain. 
  Measures have also been taken to support the northern 
oblasts 
with automotive transportation and machine operators. More than 
18,000 trucks and a good deal of other equipment was sent to the 
Republic's main grain region. As we know, great difficulties 
arose with providing fuel and lubricants for the harvesting 
work. Therefore the government was constantly dealing with these 
issues. A good deal has already been done so that the rural 
areas will not have difficulties in acquiring gasoline, diesel 
fuel, lubricants, or spare parts. 
  All these issues are being resolved operationally through 
harvest commissions that have been especially created in all 
oblasts. There is only a small part of the grain fields left to 
harvest and the farmers are taking advantage of every hour of 
good weather. 
  If you recall, in the middle of last summer while the 
weather 
was still good they were speaking about a grain yield from the 
new harvest of 30 million and even more. Because of objective 
factors, of course, this goal can no longer be reached. But one 
thing is for certain: the state order will be fulfilled, the 
farms will be fully supplied with seeds and forage, and there 
will be sufficient grain for free trade. Kazakhstan remains a 
reliable supplier of grain under interstate agreements as well. 
  Fairly good potato and vegetable crops are expected. And 
here 
too it is necessary to reduce to a minimum losses during 
harvesting and preparation for storage. 
  More than last year's amount of feed has been stored up for 
animal husbandry. On the whole, according to our indications, 
the year should end productively for agriculture. 
  [KazTAG] A new class is being born in the 
Republic--entrepreneurs. Judging from the press, relations 
between commercial structures and the government do not always 
develop smoothly. In your view, what has caused this--the 
inability of our businessmen to do their work correctly or 
mistakes in legal, credit, and other questions? 
  [Tereshchenko] The transition of society from one condition 
to another, as experience in other countries shows, cannot be 
easy. Therefore relations between the government and the new 
classes being born in society cannot be easy either. But the 
reason for this is not simply the inability of the businessmen 
to conduct their business or mistakes of the government in 
legal, credit, or other questions. No. The reason lies 
elsewhere. The Republic has not yet fully developed the 
necessary legislative base. This makes it impossible for private 
entrepreneurship to develop normally. Therefore the government 
anticrisis program is aimed at resolving a number of issues 
concerning this problem, and it should be carried out in stages. 
  In keeping with this, on the basis of previously adopted 
laws 
on entrepreneurship, a draft codified law on entrepreneurship 
was recently adopted and a draft of a new law on the activity of 
stock exchanges was submitted to the Supreme Council. The fund 
for support of entrepreneurship was audited, a statute on the 
fund and a complex of primary measures for developing 
small-scale and medium-scale entrepreneurship have been 
developed, and a work group is being formed for drawing up 
programs for the development of entrepreneurship during 
1994-1995. 
  And quite recently a decision was adopted to create a 
ramified system of centers for small business. We are also 
preparing to conduct the first large forum of representatives of 
nearby and distant foreign countries this autumn. 
  But the basic problems of entrepreneurship share a common 
nature for all the economy: the growth of inflation, 
nonpayments, and so forth, and therefore a great deal will 
depend precisely on their solutions. 
  As for the relations between the government and the 
entrepreneurs, in my opinion, these are quite normal working 
contacts. There are, of course, differences of opinion and 
certain misunderstandings, but these are unavoidable in work. 
The government and the entrepreneurial structures that have 
appeared in business are cooperating more and more closely. And 
we intend to continue to strengthen this partnership in the 
future. 
  [KazTAG] In our society a great deal of interest is being 
manifested in the condition of Kazakhstan's foreign economic 
relations and the prospects for its cooperation with countries 
of the so-called distant foreign countries. How advantageous is 
this for the Republic and are our misgivings regarding our 
concessions to foreign businessmen justified? Is there a 
concrete return from foreign visits of government delegations? 
  [Tereshchenko] These are very important questions and I 
would 
like to answer them in more detail. The more so since I can 
sense a certain subtext: Why do these government bureaucrats 
like to visit the well-off countries of the West and East, is it 
not for their own satisfaction or to search for personal 
advantage? Whoever thinks that, I dare to assure you, is 
profoundly mistaken. 
  The truth is that for the current stage of the establishment 
of our young sovereign state active foreign economic activity is 
as necessary as the air we breathe. And only competent people 
should engage in this. Because of its geographical position, its 
wealth of natural resources, and the scientific-technical and 
production potential that has been created, Kazakhstan attracts 
attention from many foreign countries. Therefore, in spite of 
the deep economic crisis, more than 2,000 of our enterprises, 
associations, and concerns are participating in the foreign 
economic sphere, and we have created 1,140 joint ventures and 
more than 30 various associations. 
  The results are promising: During 1992 the Republic's 
overall 
foreign trade turnover amounted to $1,958.1 million, of which 
$1,489.3 million was exports and $468.8 million was imports, and 
during the first half of 1993 the volume of export-import 
deliveries reached $879.9 million. Foreign trade relations were 
maintained with 56 states of the world and export deliveries 
were made to 53 countries. 
  Especially large volumes were reached in exports of items of 
nonferrous and ferrous metallurgy, mineral-ore raw material, oil 
and petroleum products, and products of the chemical industry. 
An important position in exports was occupied by deliveries of 
products of the agro-industrial complex. At the present time 
there has been a considerable expansion of economic relations 
with the United States, the PRC, Turkey, the Republic of Korea, 
Germany, England, France, Italy, Canada, Switzerland, Spain, 
Austria, and the countries of Eastern Europe. 
  Along with export-import operations on an ever-increasing 
scale, the Republic is consistently conducting a policy to 
enlist foreign investments and credit resources necessary for 
the development and modernization of the economy. This pertains 
above all to searching, prospecting, extracting, and processing 
hydrocarbon raw material. 
  One of the largest projects in joint entrepreneurship is the 
creation, with the participation of the American firm Chevron 
Overseas Company, of the joint venture Tengishevroyl. The profit 
received by this enterprise will make it possible to resolve not 
only the social problems of Atyrau Oblast but also questions of 
financing other joint projects on the territory of Kazakhstan. 
Large-scale projects are also being carried out in conjunction 
with the French concern Elf-Aquitaine, with the Sultanate of 
Oman, the Turkish Republic, and a number of European and 
American firms, and the preparation of contracts is being 
completed with an alliance of the firms British Gas (England) 
and the AGIP Company (Italy) as well as the international 
consortium for developing the Caspian shelf. 
  With the participation of foreign partners we have organized 
the production of radio and television equipment, refrigerators, 
computers, household pneumatic heat pumps, and electronic 
watches, the processing of leather-fur and other agricultural 
raw material, and the output of construction materials and 
sanitary porcelain items as well as other products. 
  In order to further develop the export potential and solve 
socioeconomic problems, the Republic now has a number of target 
credit agreements worth a total of $1 billion, through which we 
have already begun financing and assimilation. Of the overall 
number of projects financed from the credit that has been 
granted, 28 percent are facilities of processing branches of the 
agro-industrial complex; this includes the production of 
children's food and the processing of milk and meat. Some 20 
percent of the credit has been used for the construction of 
facilities for producing consumer goods, and 44 percent--for 
modernizing production of the petroleum and gas industry and 
other branches of the national economy. 
  The rapid development of foreign business ties has required 
that we further improve state management of foreign economic 
activity and form a modern legislative and normative base which 
would meet all international requirements. 
  And a considerable amount of work has been done in this 
direction. Laws adopted on foreign investments, currency 
regulation, and others create favorable conditions for the 
entrepreneurial and economic activity of foreign partners. The 
Republic can now cooperate with the international community 
under equal conditions and be a full-fledged guarantor of its 
foreign economic activity. 
  The government is also actively pursuing a policy for 
strengthening the impact of foreign economic relations on all 
aspects of management. To these ends it has developed and is 
implementing a special program for the development of foreign 
economic activity. Decisions have been adopted concerning the 
procedure for forming the Republic currency fund, currency funds 
of local organs of power and enterprises, and a number of other 
documents that make it possible to coordinate work for 
mobilizing existing resources and possibilities of solving 
pressing economic problems. 
  But there are also many still unsolved problems related to 
difficulties of the transition period. We are taking a sober 
look at things and are aware that as a result of the rigidly 
centralized policy of the former Union and the unlimited 
dictatorship of the command-administrative system, the economy 
of Kazakhstan has acquired a clearly marked raw material 
direction. In order to become a full-fledged developed state 
that is capable of offering its citizens normal conditions for 
material life, we will have to eliminate this ugly distortion as 
quickly as possible and achieve effective structural 
transformations in the economy. Let me say directly that we will 
not be able to solve this problem without close cooperation with 
industrial powers or without extensive enlistment of foreign 
investments. This is precisely why we must sometimes find 
compromise solutions with our foreign partners. 
  We would like to use foreign investments primarily for more 
rapid development of the Republic's consumer complex, that is, 
for the construction of enterprises of light industry and for 
processing agricultural products, and producing 
science-intensive, technically complex durable goods. 
  Modernization of the material and technical base in the 
fuel-energy, metallurgical, chemical, and petrochemical 
complexes, which constitute the basis of Kazakhstan's economy 
and its export capabilities, require a good deal of attention 
and money. And here the interests of foreign states will not 
always coincide with ours. Yet we are placing a great deal of 
hope in close cooperation with international financial and 
economic organizations, primarily with those such as the 
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, and others. 
  As for the results of foreign visits of government 
delegations I can say the following. 
  We have been convinced repeatedly that for our foreign 
partners a serious guarantee of the development of economic ties 
with Kazakhstan is the level of its interstate relations with 
other countries, the existence of contracts and agreements that 
determine priority spheres of cooperation, direct participation 
in negotiations on large projects by the head of our state and 
other leaders, and the course that is being pursued toward 
strengthening political stability in the Republic. 
  Based on this, during the course of the visits we have 
discussed questions of mutually advantageous political, 
economic, scientific-technical and cultural cooperation, and 
conditions for enlisting foreign investments in our economy. 
This is producing results. Thus, for example, the visit by the 
president of the Austrian Republic, negotiations with Federal 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and the government, and meetings with 
business circles of the country made it possible to conclude an 
agreement to open an unlimited line of credit for Kazakhstan. It 
is difficult to overestimate the political significance of this 
agreement, which actually marked a breakthrough into the world 
credit market. 
  The president's visit to the United States in May 1992 made 
it possible to expand possibilities of cooperation with America 
and to conclude important bilateral agreements, including in the 
area of trade. Pursuant to this agreement Kazakhstan was granted 
most favored nation status, it placed our relations on a 
qualitatively new level, and it was a guarantee that the 
Republic would be granted credit by the U.S. government, 
including for the implementation of investment programs of the 
Commercial-Credit Corporation and the Export-Import Bank of the 
United States. 
  Another concrete step toward extensive enlistment of 
American 
capital in the Republic were the agreements on encouragement and 
mutual protection of capital investments and stimulation of 
investments. 
  During the course of the visit of the government delegation 
to China a number of documents of great political and economic 
significance were signed. Among them were agreements on state 
credit from the PRC for a total of 30 million yuans under 
preferential conditions and the opening on the territory of 
Kazakhstan of Chinese stores for selling goods for rubles. 
Agreement was reached regarding questions of automotive 
shipments, strengthening of cooperation in the area of rail 
transportation and the use of air transportation, and also 
points for crossing over the state border and mutual travel of 
citizens. 
  There were similar visits from official delegations of the 
Republic to Pakistan, India, Turkey, the FRG, France, the 
Sultanate of Oman, Iran, Israel, Mongolia, Thailand, and 
Australia. All this made it possible to considerably raise the 
level of our mutual relations with foreign countries, to step up 
trade and economic cooperation with them, and to discover new 
partners in various spheres of the economy. 
  I would like to especially emphasize that the Cabinet of 
Ministers, its presidium, the ministries and departments, and 
the local executive organs are now working under unusual 
conditions and are constantly searching, sometimes to no avail. 
The task is to promptly draw conclusions from the lessons that 
have occurred and not don sack cloth and ashes. I am convinced 
that we citizens of Kazakhstan are like-thinkers. We must make 
every effort in the name of the noble cause of strengthening the 
sovereignty of our young state, the main components of which, in 
my view, are the country's political independence, the 
possibility for all healthy forces in a socially oriented 
economy to manifest themselves, and the provision of interethnic 
harmony for all citizens of Kazakhstan. 
  [KazTAG] We know, Sergey Aleksandrovich, that you returned 
from Moscow late in the evening last Saturday. What was the 
purpose of your trip? 
  [Tereshchenko] In the capital of Russia, in spite of the 
difficult situation, there was a meeting of a bilateral 
Russian-Kazakh commission. We considered the question of 
supporting practical measures aimed at fulfilling 
intergovernmental agreements on the unification of monetary 
systems. Our delegation was headed by First Deputy Prime 
Minister Daulet Sembayev. It did a great deal of work, and I too 
became involved in the final stage. 
  Let me say outright that not everyone in the Russian 
government agrees about the need to unify monetary systems. But 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin and the 
chairman of the Russian Central Bank, Viktor Vladimirovich 
Gerashchenko, have shown that they understand our serious 
problems and are firm in their intention to help Kazakhstan 
solve them. 
  Groups of experts from interested ministries and departments 
are already working in all areas of monetary-credit, budget, 
price, tax, and trade policy, the regulation of foreign economic 
activity, and customs work. They have drawn up an initial list 
of legislative acts in the aforementioned areas. The commission 
has noted that they contain no fundamental disagreements, and 
this creates good preconditions for the most rapid completion of 
work for unification of legislation. To put it briefly, the 
commission has not found any obstacles to the adoption of a 
decision on the unification of monetary systems. 
  In our discussion we have already touched upon this 
complicated issue which is so vitally important for Kazakhstan, 
but allow me to repeat myself. The Republic's immediate future 
with respect to emerging from the economic credit-monetary and 
financial chaos will depend largely on how seriously and wisely 
our people's deputies approach the ratification of this 
agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Republic of Kazakhstan Vice-President Yerik </F>
Asanbayev: "Our Turn Towards Independence Began With Our 
Declaration of Sovereignty."] 
  [Text] Among the noteworthy events that placed our 
Republic on its road to true independence was, without doubt, 
the ratification of a declaration of state sovereignty on 25 
October 1990 by the Supreme Soviet. 
  This document was not just "functional" in that period 
alone. 
Time has shown that it has provided, simultaneously, the 
foundation of the new Republic constitution and opened the way 
to sociopolitical and socioeconomic [development] for 
Kazakhstan. On the third anniversary of the ratification of this 
declaration, reporters of YEGEMEN QAZAQSTAN and KAZAKHSTANSKAYA 
PRAVDA asked Republic of Kazakhstan Vice-President Yerik 
Asanbayev about the process by which this document was prepared 
and the role played by this declaration in Kazakhstan's 
achieving its independence. 
  [Correspondent] Yerik Maghzumuly, you can speak from direct 
personal experience about this historic document. You took the 
lead in creating the declaration as the then chairman of the 
Republic Supreme Soviet and you reported at the session on its 
fundamental provisions. For that reason, we think that no one 
knows better than you how this document was prepared and how it 
was ratified. 
  [Asanbayev] First of all, you must bear in mind the 
situation 
in the country at the time when work on the declaration was 
begun. The process leading to the path of sovereignty for the 
republics had just begun. The way had been opened for the 
establishment of direct, horizontal relationships by-passing the 
central authority. The first signs were appearing of wasting 
away of the Union state. This situation, as is well known now, 
had come about because of problems in shaping the Union budget, 
and due to inability to resolve international and internal 
Soviet conflicts. It is understandable that national movements 
aimed at self-government began to gain ground. However, the 
ruling structures of the Soviet Union had in their hands 
sufficient force; and they had used means to manage the nation, 
especially its economic system, with administrative-dictatorial 
methods. Powerful quick-reaction forces, above all the military 
and industrial complex, remained standing. How could the road to 
independence be without cost? The central authority continued to 
depend upon Kazakhstan as a raw materials base. It was not 
possible to change that in an instant. We were repeatedly 
accused openly by name of striving to overthrow the Union. There 
were also direct intimidations. I remember how Lukyanov called 
and demanded that I carry out the decisions of the central 
authority without deviation. He reminded me that if I did not 
the situation could become difficult. However, as Lord Salisbury 
said, "The most common error in politics is to adhere to an 
outdated policy." It was not possible to halt our striving for 
sovereignty. In the Soviet state, the real legal basis for 
reforming the country had been destroyed. We were near to 
completing work on a new Union treaty. In the end, the USSR 
showed its impotency. 
  If now we forget for a minute the conditions under which the 
declaration came into being, and if we now try to evaluate it, 
we note that it had, in fact, some incomplete features. But it 
is well known that one cannot look at an historical document 
with the eyes of today. 
  We set about preparing our Declaration of Sovereignty after 
similar documents had been ratified by several union republics. 
They began with a declaration of "sovereignty" with respect to 
the central authority and followed up with the undertaking of a 
few cautious acts leading up to specific political action. For 
that reason, believe what I say, working with such documents and 
enriching them with specific historical circumstances and with 
the content expected by the people was not such an easy thing. 
To a certain degree these were uncertain, resolute steps of 
heroism by the Republic president and parliament. 
  The draft of the declaration was prepared by a working group 
comprised of the senior council of the Supreme Soviet drawn from 
the ranks of people's deputies, representatives of the executive 
organs, various sector specialists, including many 
scientist-economists, and legal specialists. I am not 
overstating it. They did a great deal of work. Hundreds of 
suggestions of various kinds coming in from the citizens of the 
Republic were reviewed. Drafts and suggestions of the government 
and of some social units were discussed. Tens of drafts were 
made of the declaration. The [final] draft was reviewed twice by 
the senior council and in an expanded session of the 
presidential council. Subsequently it was offered to the public 
for general discussion. Only after that did it reach the hands 
of the deputies. 
  The ratification of the declaration in a session of 
parliament had a democratic quality. After heated discusses and 
many hours of arguments on the draft, the Supreme Soviet formed 
a special commission comprised of people's deputies to see to 
its revision. The commission was headed by member of parliament, 
academician, and noted legal expert Salyq Zimanov. Here too 
there were broad exchanges of views and various drafts were 
suggested. All in all, passionate creative work could not be 
achieved in an instant. The revised draft was again discussed in 
a session of parliament and there had to be a debate. Every 
fourth deputy participated in the debate. In the end, this 
document of remarkable fate for Kazakhstan was ratified by a 
majority in parliament. 
  [Correspondent] It would seem to be unnecessary to take the 
declaration into account at the time the new constitution was 
ratified. How did this happen? 
  [Asanbayev] It was in fact not easy. I will not present all 
the facts but limit myself to just a few. The declaration was 
the first document in the history of Kazakhstan which decided as 
a totality, and once and for all, all questions regarding the 
status of the Republic as a free state and confirmed it through 
strict legal means. If you look again at the words of the 
declaration, you will find there all characteristics of a 
sovereign nation: territory and citizenship entirely under the 
control of the Republic; the freedom and totality of state power 
within the nation; guidance based solely upon the constitution 
and upon laws; our own budgetary and financial system; our own 
armed forces; freedom in international relations. 
  We must not denigrate the importance of the declaration by 
saying that through this sanctioned act of law certain 
individuals desired to announce who they were to a central 
authority. This document drew the outlines of our free country. 
It is the support upon which today's independent state of 
Kazakhstan is based. 
  For that reason, the declaration, as is written in its text, 
was to be the base for the creation of a new constitution and, 
at the same time, it was to open the way for the ratification of 
various laws on citizenship, property, foreign investment, etc., 
by a state which had achieved its sovereign status in practice. 
  It must be stated that many republics ratified declarations 
of sovereignty at that time to become the foundations of new 
constitutions. For example, the declaration of state sovereignty 
in Belarus was given status as constitutional law and its 
provisions have been placed above actual constitutional norms. 
  During work after that on the draft of the new Republic 
constitution many provisions of the declaration found direct 
expression in its text. 
  For example, if you compare the prefaces to the declaration 
and to the constitution, their primary aims and aspirations are 
very similar to one another. Also look at such areas as the 
indivisibility of the territory of Kazakhstan in the proclaimed 
declaration, Kazakhstan's territorial inviolability, the 
division of powers, the right of each to own property of the 
various kinds and equality of ownership, the guarantee of the 
protection [by law] of property of the various kinds, the legal 
equality of all nationalities and nations and of all 
nationalities and nations in all sectors of their social life, 
etc. All of these things were later put into the constitution 
and some were even taken as the basis of the constitutional 
structure. That is to say that certain fruitful thoughts within 
the principles of the declaration found their complete 
reflection in the constitution. 
  [Correspondent] To be sure, the constitution is an honored 
document for all citizens. This is the way that constitutions 
are evaluated in every civilized country. Surely this idea was 
always dominant in the sessions of the Supreme Soviet? This 
being the case, how did you get into an argument with parliament. 
  [Asanbayev] It was not that way at all. In general, I am 
against hasty categorical statements. However, I should offer 
some specific examples in this connection. For example, it was 
proclaimed in section seven of the declaration that the 
government of the state would be carried out according to the 
principle of a division between legislative, executive, and 
judicial powers. As is generally known to the people, this does 
not make clear the advantage and usefulness of the 
representational division between those holding the mentioned 
powers; but, at the same time, it foresees the creation of an 
entire system. Under such circumstances, if we may quote the 
words of Thomas Jefferson, one of the fathers of the American 
constitution: "Those in power must make government uniform so 
that it encounters no powerful stops or counter actions from 
other quarters; or that the institutions of governmental power 
do not go beyond the bounds of their legal powers." 
Unfortunately, there are only parts of this in the new 
constitution and we have been unable to create the systems, the 
complete mechanism of government. 
  For example, if there should be unending disagreement within 
the membership of parliament endangering the regular flow of 
work, or if parliament were to enact one resolution after the 
other contrary to the constitution, the head of state does not 
have the right to dissolve it. Likewise, there is also no right, 
by way of a parliamentary balance, to remove the president from 
office if he acts contrary to the constitution, if the country 
has been betrayed, or for committing other malicious and serious 
crimes. However, the president, relying on experiences which 
have withstood the test of time of a number of civilized 
countries, was successful in a major effort to have these norms 
included in the draft of the constitution. However, these ideas 
were not ratified at meetings of the constitutional Commission. 
In the parliamentary session during the process of ratification, 
many deputies did not take note of the urgency of these 
questions. However, complications arising from a lack of a 
complete understanding of the motive forces of the constitution, 
and what has resulted from the lack of legal means to regulate 
difficult circumstances of the sort that exist now, are viewed 
differently today. 
  You cannot find in the text of the new constitution even the 
slightest possibility for the head of state to have the most 
limited, I repeat, the most limited influence on the courts. 
However, the court system as it operates today operates 
altogether independently of anything and anyone. This has 
resulted in the development of criminality in the Republic. Such 
circumstances very much alarm me as a member of the Republic's 
Security Council. Moreover, it was suggested not once but 
repeatedly to the Constitutional Commission that they resolve 
this problem in a quiet manner. We said that the head of state 
must appoint [officers of] the courts. In addition, it was 
suggested that court appointments be by democratic means, 
utilizing a structure such as the Supreme Court Council under 
the president. It is comprised of the senior justices of the 
Republic's Supreme Court, specialists from the Ministry of 
Justice and the chief procurator's office, advocates and other 
specialists in the legal sector, and three deputies sent by 
parliament. 
  Looking carefully at the question of organizing the work of 
courts of justice, advice should be given about questions such 
as appointment of [the officers of the] courts by the president, 
removal and overruling of judges, and the application of rewards 
and punishments. The courts are organs which have such broad 
powers and which, at the same time, require very knowledgeable 
people to serve on them. However this idea has still not been 
carried out. 
  [Correspondent] How do you evaluate the constitution. 
  [Asanbayev] I evaluate it very highly. Its stabilizing role 
in our society is very great. However, there is no need to say 
that it was a complex and difficult task to draw up properly, in 
a very compact and complete manner, such a broad, great document 
in a short time in view of the varied state of our views in an 
era of transition and our lack of experience in establishing our 
statehood. However, there are various quite disparate views 
about the character of the constitution. While some think of it 
as the constitution of a presidential Republic, others say that 
it is the constitution of a state of the parliamentary model. 
While some say that the constitution looks forward to the 
distant future, others think that it is a purely conservative 
document. In the view of one expert, our constitution is rather 
far from freedom. In truth, the constitution has come into being 
through the reconciliation of yesterday and today; the old and 
the new. This is because our society is today in transition and 
that is the reality of the present. In addition, the 
constitution has come into being as a result of a mutual 
agreement between united forces; between all the various groups 
living in society. 
  We should mention here that for that reason no one has the 
right to appropriate the authority of the constitution and to 
attach any kind of special rights to it. 
  Let us now consider the most important question. We, as you 
yourselves know, live in a time of transition. The entire system 
of economic relationships and of our social development is being 
refined to advance society. This, to be sure, demands a deep 
understanding of the questions of legislative work and 
consideration of many phenomena in this sector. We think that 
the new parliament to be chosen in the future will know how to 
find a profitable and reliable mechanism for this activity, 
moving away from the decrepit older system. 
  The honorable thought must take shape in our society that 
our 
constitution answers all the requirements of law and for that 
reason it is the duty of all citizens to carry out [its 
provisions]. It, like the constitutions of other peoples, is the 
collective state ideology of development in this era. We must 
forbid, whether it is on the part of members of parliament which 
ratified the document, or individual scientists or social 
activists, the casting of stones at the honor of the 
constitution, on the one hand, and, on the other, raising a 
storm of incomprehensible and false criticism . We must 
encourage instead feelings of high honor in our society for this 
highly esteemed law of the state. Knowing how to show respect 
for the constitution has, whatever the time or whatever the 
place, been a sign of pure citizenship, of culture, and of 
patriotism. 
  To exchange views and share ideas, we should discuss some of 
the ideas which find expression in the constitution from a 
theoretical point of view. 
  [Correspondent] Could you not touch on this area in more 
detail? 
  [Asanbayev] Let me settle one of the things which has been 
much disputed. That is the question of the establishment of a 
two house executive organ, with the higher powers called the 
National Executive Mazhilis. 
  Such a structure has been characteristic of parliamentary 
democracy since early times and is properly used in many 
countries of the world. What is special about it? 
  It would be beneficial in that it would be a 
regularly-functioning professional parliament and superior to 
our Supreme Kenges in that respect. Thereby there would be the 
possibility of creating a legislative policy that would be 
carefully filtered and carefully considered. Matters extraneous 
to legislating on a given occasion could be kept at a distance 
or, otherwise, they could be dealt with through supplementary 
legal acts. 
  Still, it would be possible to improve considerably the 
preparation of drafts of law and their qualitative levels. We 
have nothing to be proud about presently in this question. Laws 
would be passed twice before the deputies [for review]. Not only 
would each house state its views regarding whether it approves 
or disapproves a draft of a law, but it is important that laws 
would be ratified in fact. Under such circumstances, it is clear 
that the responsibility of parliament and of its members would 
increase. 
  A two-house structure would contribute to the development of 
collegiality in the work of the deputies, and within the 
chambers as a whole would increase knowledge and the pace of 
parliamentary work. 
  In many countries it is not easy to solve the problem of the 
inequality of delegations of deputies from various territorial 
units. (If, for example, one compares the present number of 
Qaraghandy and Qyzylorda deputies, what this problem means for 
Kazakhstan emerges very clearly.) Through the two-house 
structure it would be possible to reduce the negative effects of 
the narrow thinking of so-called "parliamentary game players" 
that results from the clash of class interests or "looking out 
for the village" in making territorial or sector laws. There 
would be uniformity in central and regional forces. Parliament 
would become an organ where the interests of the entire country 
and of the regions would meet; where compromises would be made. 
  The role of the regions has increased over what it was 
before. This is because the true economic and social life is not 
in the "corridors of power" of the capital but has passed over 
to local areas where the fate of reform is decided in fact. It 
would be beneficial for parliament to be well versed in the 
problems coming from these areas and to seek for ways of 
resolving them through law. 
  It is well known that the executive authority is critical of 
parliament and prepares its decisions, to be heard twice by 
parliament, with extreme care. The influence of this cannot but 
reach the president. The possibility for supervision in a 
session would be expanded [by having two houses.] 
  Exactly how, at this time, can we make clear just what a 
two-house parliament would be in Kazakhstan? The parliament 
would be comprised of two chambers: the upper--a senate, and the 
lower--a house of deputies. The senate would be comprised of two 
deputies chosen by an electorate comprised of all the local 
Kenges deputies from every oblast, the capital, and Leninsk 
City. Ten members of the Senate would be named by the president. 
They would be persons with special knowledge or who had acquired 
a great deal of experience in social service. Let me say, among 
other things, that the upper house of France's parliament is 
comprised of those elected indirectly and [having] one group of 
deputies chosen by the president is a system employed in India, 
Italy, and Pakistan. The house of deputies would be comprised of 
135 deputies elected by majority votes from equal electoral 
districts. 
  Each chamber would have its specific duties. Each would be 
given their own appropriate and varied powers, according to 
provision. The lower house, that is, those deputies directly 
elected by the people, would play the deciding and initiating 
role in legislation and in cadre questions (this is because the 
right to initiate legislation would be exercised only there). On 
the other hand, the upper chamber, with representative numbers 
equal by region, would be the main force in resolving 
international and republic-regional questions. Such differences 
in function would assist in raising the capacities for service 
[of each chamber], their knowledge, and the degree to which they 
would be well informed. There would be activities involving 
extremely broad questions that would have to be resolved by the 
two houses jointly. 
  The legislative process would be as simple as possible and, 
at the same time, as effective as possible. Drafts of proposed 
laws would be reviewed by the lower chamber, provision by 
provision, and approved as a whole. A draft of a law approved by 
the members of the lower house by a majority vote would be sent 
for review to the upper house. The Senate, if necessary, would 
enter changes and additions and return it to the house of 
deputies. If the lower house is not opposed to the changes, the 
law would be considered ratified. Disagreements between the two 
houses would be resolved through compromise procedures. If a 
compromise is not possible, the original decision could be 
approved by a two-thirds vote of all members of the lower house. 
  To be sure, there would be drafts of laws that would have to 
be considered by both houses. Under such circumstances, a joint 
Mazhilis of the senate and house of deputies would be called. If 
a majority of deputies voted in favor in a joint Mazhilis, a law 
could be considered ratified. 
  According to American conceptions of the executive, a draft 
of a law is passed through the two houses of congress and openly 
and fully discussed. It [either] encounters major changes 
through corrections before it become law or it ends up being 
dropped as nothing more than an idle suggestion. 
  This idea would never find use with us. Against it would be 
such traditions as "the single house parliament has still not 
exhausted itself," or "we are still not ready to do this kind of 
thing." The following argument has also been advanced in 
addition to evidence easy to refute: Kazakhstan is a unitary 
state. However, whether one chooses a two-house parliament or 
not, the nation will not be moved towards federalism. However, a 
two-house parliament has never been a sign of a federal state 
anywhere. There are many examples. We note that the parliaments 
of Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, and Japan, all 
considered unitary states, are comprised of two houses. Those 
countries did not choose a two-house system for more convenient 
solution of problems arising within their state territories, but 
to refine the legislative process. 
  I think that sooner or later this beneficial system will be 
put into effect. This is because we cannot continue to be 
limited and cannot be repressed by the coming and going of 
completely new people [elected as deputies]. Events progress at 
their own speed but it is clear, at the very root of things, 
that we will find the most proper way. We must know how to be 
opposed to such things as getting puffed up about tireless work, 
old boy networks, accomplishing nothing; about creating 
problems, burnout, and excessive politicking. In order for me to 
make this thought clear, let me offer an historical example. As 
you know, Charles de Gaulle put into the constitution of the 
Fifth Republic the basic elements of presidential authority and 
guaranteed its stability. Socialist F. Mitterand later said 
about this version of the constitution. "When he was president, 
we did not like the constitution but now, when we ourselves are 
in power, it seems to support our own position." 
  During the first period of the writing of the draft of the 
constitution, the members of the commission were caught up by 
broad national interests. This made it possible for us, in the 
Autumn of 1991, to lay down the foundations of the future 
constitution in a very short time: the structure was made clear, 
a clearly systematized ideology was chosen (that the state was 
for people, not the reverse), and the basic problems of content 
were solved. Various versions were prepared. Plans were made to 
organize the assembling of the draft broadly among native and 
foreign experts and specialists and we began to carry them out. 
  Our country's achieving its independence demanded that we 
speed up work on the draft, since a constitution is a sign of 
independence. For that treason, from the beginning of 1992, the 
work of the constitutional Commission was managed by the 
president of the republic. The final polishing of the draft of 
the constitution was able to go forward in a systematic manner, 
with N.A. Nazarbayev chairing the meetings of the constitutional 
Commission. 
  However, in addition to speeding up the process, the 
influence of various groups and individual factors began to be 
recognized in the work on the constitution. At that time the 
Constitutional Commission became, in terms of its membership, in 
fact an enlarged senior council of the Supreme Kenges. When, 
during December of the previous year, the membership of the 
commission had been expanded by a further 14 people's deputies, 
their clear power became conspicuous. I think that all of this 
was only favorable to the task at hand. 
  [Correspondent] Yerik Maghzumuly, let us return to the 
declaration. Its ratification was no ordinary event. It 
exhibited the peculiarities of the time in which it was prepared 
and written: the president of the Republic had begun to 
consolidate power, a new parliamentary system had come into 
being, there was a previously unheard of flow of legislation, 
there was a rise in the number of political demonstrations, and 
signs were being seen of the beginning of democratic maturity in 
society and in the state. 
  [Asanbayev] You are right. It was as if our whole lives were 
confined to a week. We worked day and night. The times were 
full, to the greatest degree, of important events. That time was 
the most interesting time I remember in my life. 
  Think about it. After I was elected first chairman of the 
Supreme Kenges from among several alternative candidates, we 
began to master the knowledge and experience of a secret and for 
us hitherto unknown parlamentarianism, together with my 
colleagues in a body of deputies that was "on fire." This was in 
order that we should enter upon the difficult road whereby I 
would shape the work of the first democratically elected Supreme 
Kenges. 
  For the first time we were in fact organizing the 
legislative 
activities of the Supreme Kenges. It is no secret that hitherto 
all questions of legislation were decided by the Union and that 
the overwhelming majority of all legal documents from the 
republics were confined to the reproduction of Union legal 
norms. Leaving aside questions of organization, all in all there 
was no true legislative action in Kazakhstan. Questions such as 
legislative strategy, planning legislative activities, and 
carrying out parliamentary supervision over the work of 
organizations exercising control over the way laws were being 
carried out and reporting to the Kenges, even the simple 
technical equipment guaranteeing the voting process of deputies, 
had hitherto not existed. 
  We devoted a great deal of our efforts to mastering the work 
methods needed to draft laws, just to get used to them in large 
quantities. Hitherto the laws were "cooked in the pot" of the 
central authority and the republics fulfilled them. For that 
reason we kept our executive authority, as in the system of all 
developed states of the world, in a purely legislative 
parliament, and it was not ready at that time to take all the 
difficulties of drafting laws upon its own neck. For that 
reason, drafts of some laws of considerable importance for 
regulating every area of social relationships, and [in any case] 
always of the highest priority, were prepared within 
parliamentary committees and commissions. We began to master for 
ourselves the entire science of legislation, from the basics up 
to how a draft was prepared, and how to divide a law into parts. 
To tell the truth, I remembered several times Bismarck's caustic 
remark: "If you love sausages and laws, do not go see how they 
are made." 
  I would like to mention in passing in this context the 
important and fruitful work of deputy speaker of the parliament, 
Z. Fedotova, in taking upon her neck the basic difficulties of 
organizing parliamentary legislative activities during this 
period. She greatly aided the chief of parliament, myself, in 
learning the secrets of many legal questions. 
  At that time there were many important questions to be 
resolved, other than purely legislative problems. For example, 
one of them was the Semey Testing Area. During its very first 
session, the parliament demanded the closing of the testing area 
from the Union government. When this demand was not met, a 
resolution of the Supreme Kenges was ratified in the second 
session prohibiting nuclear explosions and testing of all forms 
of weapons of mass destruction in the territories of the 
Republic. I think that this was one of the primary victories 
gained by the present body of deputies. Nonetheless, all the 
leaders of the Union forthwith looked askance at our resolution 
and I suffered a certain amount of pressure as chairman of the 
Kenges. The deputies encountered considerable opposition, 
especially from the military-industrial complex. However time 
smoothes everything. The testing area has been closed forever. 
  The parliament set about solving important state and 
economic 
problems, such as specifying local powers and local systems of 
self-government and regulating property relationships. For a 
long time, various versions of legal provisions were discussed, 
and to "bake" the innovations suggested for legislation many 
meetings were held with scientists and specialists, with 
deputies of local Kenges, and with heads of industry. There were 
repeated reviews of questions which had been decided. Such were 
the characteristics of the way parliament worked with such 
fundamental questions. 
  We began efforts to refine the work of the Supreme Kenges to 
be more realistic and more systematic. It must be stated that 
much of what has become accepted practice in parliament 
operations and organization was specified during the fourth 
session, at the time that the Supreme Kenges ratified a 
resolution on refining its own operations. The urgency of many 
questions such as expanding the powers of the chairman of the 
Supreme Kenges, establishing a committee for external relations 
and parliamentary connections, the hiring of available 
consultants by committees, establishment of an office of 
control, etc., found expression in that document for the first 
time. 
  Working in parliament became very interesting. My 
willingness 
to work together with the president in solving, by me in my 
capacity of specialist, problems such as immediate economic 
reform , market systemization, and formation of a presidential 
administrative model, became an incentive for me to accept 
election to the office of vice president. 
  However, the declaration of Sovereignty occupied a special 
place during that complex half a year full of memorable events 
when I worked as head of the parliament. This is because our 
turn towards state independence in truth, with intelligence, and 
with purpose, began with it. The declaration became an 
unshakable foundation for the solving of political and legal 
problems of extremely great scope in direct connection with our 
formation of a state.

<F P=106> [Article by Republic of Kazakhstan Minister of Finance </F>
Yerkeshbay Derbisov: "Where Will We Get the Money!?"] 
  [Text] Today, whatever the sector, crisis is 
paramount. [There is] inflation, a payments crisis... Various 
systemic changes are being made in connection with a transition 
to a market economy. For everything finances are needed. 
Government continues to expand. What do we do in such 
circumstances? 
  World experience has proven that the four props upon which a 
market economy rests are holding companies, trust companies, 
financial and industrial groups, and transnational corporations. 
However, no attention has been given to the organization and 
efficient operation of structures such as these [in Kazakhstan]. 
Fulfillment of the president's edict: "On Refinement of the 
System of Organs Managing the Economy" continues to be put off. 
  Up to now, the system of Republic state control organs has 
been changed several times. At present 32 ministries and 
committees, 10 chief administrations, and various agents and 
authorities are included among Republic administrative organs. 
The high number of those working in the central apparatus of 
these organizations has exceeded 6,526. Just when it was 
announced that we will have to strictly regulate the number of 
such workers, this figure was increased by 12.6 percent, or by 
780 persons during the period of January through September 1993. 
Within this, the Ministry of Defense has grown by 200 persons, 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by 197, the Ministry of 
Economics by 109, and the Ministry of Transport by 58. Some 
ministries want to establish their own subordinate departments. 
For example, the Ministry of Industry has asked that it 
considerably increase the number of its employees in order to 
establish departments for the mining and metallurgy sector and 
for consumer goods. Giving ministries and authorities control 
over their own structures and staffing has resulted in excessive 
increases in the number of employees. Various departments have 
proliferated in ministries using such power. The number of 
managers managing them has increased. This is a matter of "one 
person can herd sheep, but it takes a thousand to herd the soul." 
  There are 54 workers in the apparatus of the State Committee 
on Youth Affairs. To manage these workers there is a 
manager-in-chief, three deputies, and 14 administrative heads. 
That means one manager for every two workers. Managing 91 
workers in the Ministry of Tourism, Physical Culture, and Sports 
are six deputy ministers, and 21 division and unit chiefs. The 
Ministry for External Economic Relations is not far behind. Some 
three to six persons work in their four administrations. They 
manage one another and are their own deputies. At least 65,000 
rubles salary is paid to the managers given in the examples. 
Putting all of this together, we see how much money is flowing 
out of the state purse. 
  Is the fact that state organ systems have grown so 
inordinately of any benefit to their work? We cannot say that it 
is. The excessive increase in staffs is creating problems with 
retaining the needed employees. Competent and knowledgeable 
cadres which leave due to shortages of funding are going over to 
commerce. Wages there are two-three times higher than those paid 
in the state sector. Can budget organizations, pressed by budget 
shortfalls, retain them? 
  There is no doubt that to carry out fundamental economic 
reform a very strong executive authority will be needed. 
However, the conclusion should not be drawn from this that all 
authority is to be collected in the hands of the central 
authority. Reform is also going forward in local areas. We 
should note in this connection the important role being played 
by the law "On Local Self-Government and Republic of Kazakhstan 
Local Kenges of People's Deputies." Authority must be divided in 
an intelligent manner at every level. However, granting the 
right to the local kenges of people's deputies to allocate funds 
for paying the salaries and the expenses of state authority and 
control organs financed by local budgets is making the 
conservation of state funds impossible. The number of those 
working in organs funded from local budgets was 32 percent 
greater in 1993 in comparison to 1989, or 15,150 persons more. 
That means a total of 46,787 workers. Accordingly, the number of 
local kenges is growing. In 1992 some 405 of them were added to 
a total of 16,543. Their staffs grew correspondingly. For 
example, there are 23-26 employees [working] in the oblast 
kenges of Aqtobe, Aqmola, western Kazakhstan, and Pavlodar 
oblasts, and there are from 33-37 in the eastern Kazakhstan, 
southern Kazakhstan, and Kokshetaw oblast kenges. 
  The number of employees of governors of oblasts and rayons 
are similar. Whereas the number of employees in the Atyraw, 
Zhambyl, and Qaraghandy oblast governments is between 54 and 
149, the number is up to 80-83 in Aqmola, Aqtobe, and Semey 
oblasts. At present the practice of appointing five-six deputies 
per manager has become widespread. They are not distinct from 
one other in function. For example, the governors of Moyynqum 
Rayon in Zhambyl Oblast and of Aqzhayyq Rayon in western 
Kazakhstan Oblast have five deputies each. Numbers of deputies 
of the governors of Abay, Shortandy, Zhangatas, Qarataw, and 
Zhanga Ozen rayons have reached four. Thereby, you cannot help 
but wonder what is left for the governors to do with all of 
these deputies? 
  There are considerable differences between the salaries of 
these managers. In this area regulations regarding official 
salaries set in Resolution Number 312-XII, ratified on 28 June 
of 1991 by the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakhstan SSR, are not 
being observed at all. In the above resolution the right to 
solve questions about salaries paid to workers of state 
authority and administrative organs are granted to the president 
of the Republic, to the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and to 
the Cabinet of Ministers. Unfortunately, every governor and 
chief of a local kenges of people's deputies distorts the 
meaning of article seven of the law: "On Local Self-Government" 
and confuses what is meant by "wage funds" and "official 
salaries." For that reason, the amount paid as wages has become 
varied. Thus, the chairman of the rayon kenges of Zhelezinsk 
Rayon in Pavlodar Oblast pays his legal advisor wages of 34,000 
rubles instead of 28,500, and has established a wage for a 
general division chief which is 15,500 rubles too high. Such 
cases of excessive pay are also found in rayon and various 
village kenges in Semey Oblast. If, however, such generosity 
were to honor experienced and knowledgeable cadres and to keep 
them on the job this would be fine indeed. Unfortunately, 
encouragement of cadres and material incentives are not up to 
the needs of the times. 
  The appearance of improprieties of this sort, during this 
time of transition as we go over to a market economy, are not 
easy to counter in the Republic budget. Such a sharp increase in 
the number of persons working in government organs, if it 
continues, may gives rise to considerable budget deficits. This 
will have a chilling effect on the distribution of finances to 
important sectors of industry and of the people's economy. The 
financing which comes from the budget is not so great, but one 
should add the cultural and arts sectors which are so needed for 
the spiritual life of our people. Remember that, in a time when 
prices rise, the daily wages and pensions of some groups are 
barely adequate for food. In addition, what is going to be done 
about training the cadres who are going to be the tomorrow of 
industry and the people's economy, of the arts and sciences, and 
who will be tomorrow's workers in the health field. When we take 
all of this into consideration, we think it proper that the 
Republic budget be carefully measured, that there be no waste, 
that it embrace all sectors of our society, and that it be 
expended for the most important plans and key objectives. For 
this purpose, we must reduce to a single system the staff issue, 
where growth today is excessive. To this end, we should, first 
and foremost, combine ministries and committees performing 
duplicate functions, reduce staffs and the numbers of officials, 
and restructure. For example, there would be no loss if we were 
to combine the Committee on Youth Affairs with the Ministry of 
Tourism, Physical Culture, and Sports; the Ministry for Social 
Protection with the Ministry of Labor; and the Ministry of Trade 
with the Ministry of External Economic Relations. When this has 
been done, their functions would be clearly defined and extra 
workers could be discharged. I would make exactly the same 
suggestion about the State Committee for Water Reserves and the 
Chief Administration for Geodesics and Cartography. No harm 
would be done if the first were abolished and a department 
established under the Ministry of Agriculture, and if the second 
were made an agency under the Ministry of Geology for the 
protection of subterranean riches. The staff of the 
"Qazaqstanenergo" Company could be reduced by up to half. At 
present the strengthening of state control is a priority task. 
The task is at present assigned to three similar organizations: 
the Office of Control of the Supreme Kenges, the Chief Control 
Inspectorate under the President, and the Committee for State 
Financial Control under the Cabinet of Ministers. Not only does 
the division of the higher control organs create a mutual lack 
of coordination between them, but it results in wasted efforts. 
For that reason, if we combine them and create a unified State 
Control Committee, this would have enormous influence on 
productive work with a single aim. 
  When the ministries and authorities have been reformed 
through consolidation, it should become possible to reduce the 
number of apparatus workers by up to 50 percent and the staffs 
of local state authority and government administration by up to 
20 percent. In addition, we must sharply limit and stop the 
growth in the number of employees in the central apparatus. To 
achieve this ministries and authorities must be prohibited from 
expanding staffs on their own volition, and we should restore 
[the numbers of] their workers to rates previously set by the 
Cabinet of Ministers. At the same time, it would be suitable if 
a suggestion were made to the Republic Supreme Kenges regarding 
abolition of certain provisions of the law: "On Local Self 
Government and Local Kenges of People's Deputies of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan." In this connection we must review No. 888 
Resolution on Wages ratified in 1992 by the Cabinet of 
Ministers. Only if we do this will we be able to arrange 
staffing and wages paid to employees into one system. In this 
regard we should think a great deal about the amount of 
salaries. At a time when our Republic is gradually entering a 
social market economic system, there has been a general movement 
of specialists from the state into the commercial structures. 
The reason for this is the heaven and earth difference between 
the salaries of employees for the state sector and those working 
for commercial structures. Select cadres, suffering tightened 
living circumstances, are forced to think of themselves. 
However, without such specialists there is no way whatever that 
the Republic state apparatus can solve very major social and 
economic problems. Thus, we must take effective measures, 
bearing in mind the experiences of countries such as the United 
States, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan, where such workers 
were early brought into a state system. In our view, 
ratification of a law: "On State Service" by the present session 
of the Supreme Kenges would halt the further departure of 
specialists from the state apparatus and make it possible to 
retain knowledgeable workers. The most important thing is that 
the wages of cadres be appropriate to the quality of the jobs 
they do. Furthermore, it would be proper to strongly encourage 
their initiatives and to use workers according to their 
capacities. In this regard, we must not forget the various kinds 
of crime and corruption among managerial workers. The influence 
of such managers on knowledgeable cadres, thought to know their 
jobs very well, is considerable. If such things are allowed to 
continue, they will bring about the destruction of the state 
apparatus. Just such circumstances were found in the United 
States at the end of the last century, in Britain in the 18th 
century, and in South Korea in the 1950s of this century. The 
experiences of several countries have shown that it is possible 
to improve fundamentally the work of state administrative organs 
in societies which have a cultural and historical inclination to 
corruption. It is sufficient to mention, for example, the proper 
reform of the work of tax offices in the Philippines. If we set 
the situation to rights, not only refining the state 
administrative system but strengthening its influence, the way 
out to economic crisis will be easy. We need such resolute 
actions these days. 
  The operations of organs controlling the new market economy 
must be streamlined and their duties specified. There are major 
tasks [which need performing] such as the following: 
guaranteeing the security of the state and protecting the rights 
of citizens; regulation in economic terms of the development of 
the people's economy and formation of a state budge; creating 
and financing investment and structure policies; cadre policy; 
intergovernment agreements and carrying out relations with 
international organizations. These control organizations must 
work in close connection with local organs in areas such as 
putting people to work, migration, antimonopoly policy, the tax 
system, and control of state property. Only under circumstances 
where such problems, brought forward by the times, have been 
solved properly will we be able to stabilize the market and the 
economy and carry out reform in a well-founded manner.

<F P=106> [Interview with Qudaybergen Seyitmambetov, deputy chairman </F>
of the administration of the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast 
Agro-Industrial Bank, Inc., recorded by Yerkin Qydyr: "Where Is 
the Return on Our Investment?"] 
  [Text] Carrying out resolute measures in such areas 
as exchange of farsighted experiments, training, and the 
strengthening of order in the banking system in order that the 
economy of our independent Republic achieve stability is one of 
today's vital concerns. What is being done to this end in the 
southern Kazakhstan region, where industry and agriculture have 
developed, and where recently the number of banks has grown 
rapidly? What kind of unresolved problems are there between 
central and local banking layers? Our reporter spoke on this 
theme with Qudaybergen Seyitmambetov, deputy chairman of the 
administration of the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast Agro-Industrial 
Bank, Inc., one of the largest organizations in Shymkent in its 
sector. 
  [Qydyr] The view has frequently been expressed recently that 
the independence and sovereignty of a country without its own 
financing and means of exchange are uncertain. As an experienced 
specialist with 20 years experience in the banking system what 
are your views on this issue? 
  [Seyitmambetov] What you say is true. Even among the people 
there are those who would have us think that our failure to 
introduce our own currency is because our leaders are 
unenterprising and indecisive. I cannot agree with this 
position. To be sure, arrogance and sometimes pomposity have 
created problems with Russian ruble policy. However, there have 
been complaints about this and hurried measures have been taken, 
and we should not repeat the Ukrainian example. At a time of 
economic relations which have been entangled like a spider's web 
for 70 years, it is presently beneficial for us to remain within 
the ruble zone. What we need is for the head of state to make 
known his adherence to such a policy. In addition, we have still 
not fully resolved the question of foreign exchange, goods, and 
gold stocks which would serve as a basis for issuing a national 
currency in our Republic which for long years has developed only 
as a source of raw materials. For that reason, it would be 
proper for us to think about developing production and about how 
to expend correctly and properly our existing financial 
resources. 
  [Qydyr] Two or three years ago the number of bankers in the 
southern part of Kazakhstan could be counted with the fingers. 
There are at present more than 60. However, financial resources 
and hard cash have not grown along with the increase in the 
number of banks. There are those who say that this has made it 
possible for a few bankers to get rich. Some of those 
administering banks have had nothing to do with financial 
activities, and there is nothing special [i.e., they have no 
special qualifications] about those in control. This no doubt 
means that the prestige of these new activities has sunk... 
  [Seyitmambetov] As in the Soviet Union, all accounting in 
our 
country until 1988 was carried out through the state banking 
system. After that perestroyka began, and banks became 
specialized for sectors such as agriculture and industry. 
Starting in 1990, commercial banks began to appear. We can say 
that these things were the first manifestations of a transition 
to market relationships. Unfortunately, just as you have said, 
twice as many banks have now been established. However, those 
establishing banks with private capital are very few if not 
nonexistent. However, it is written in articles 20 and 22 of the 
"Law on Banks in the Republic of Kazakhstan" that, during their 
first two years of operations, banks are to live off their own 
resources, and that the heads of banks are to be professionally 
qualified and prepared. However, are these provisions being 
carried out in fact? 
  During recent years, with the rapid growth in banks, sources 
of finance have not increased. In addition to this honest 
competition has not gained ground. We have been deprived of tens 
of large-scale agro-industrial sector enterprises whose accounts 
were kept by us for a number of years. That was the reason why 
they opened the new bank. It was the livelihood of officials 
with power in their hands. They forced those enterprises to 
establish accounts with the new bank. Can we talk of honest 
competition under such conditions? When these same enterprises, 
encountering market pressures, found themselves suffering from a 
shortage of capital, the new bank could give them no help 
whatever. It came about that some [of these] enterprises again 
became our customers. Thus the stability and administrative 
methods of the banking system and even the national economy have 
been harmed. It is a fact that V.I. Lenin said: "There are 
26,000 banks in America. All are small and will not survive for 
long." In truth, whereas there were 30,139 large and small banks 
in the United States in 1920, at the end of the 1960s, as a 
result of consolidations and sector mergers, only 13,986 of them 
remained. However, during that period bank financial resources 
rose from 52 billion to 293 billion dollars. The Americans are 
not concerned about the number of banks but their quality. And 
what about us? Some banks even perform various subterfuges to 
provide the reserves required by law and go over to deception. 
For example, the recently established "Zhaqsylyq" Commercial 
Bank gave a loan of 50 million rubles in the form of a check to 
a client of ours, the "Ordabasy" Trade House. The "Ordabasy" 
Trade House, however, returned the money to the bank according 
to agreement, unused and untouched. Only through the 
intervention of officials of our bank was this illegality 
stopped. The reason is that "Ordabasy" had obtained a loan of 
millions of rubles from our bank. The matching capital obtained 
from the second bank was only to come from net profit. Here we 
must recall the wise proverb of our people: "Do not wear a club 
you cannot lift" [Do not bite off more than you can chew]. 
  Let me take advantage of the situation to made the following 
suggestion through your newspaper: We must henceforth (up 
until 1994) re-register [i.e., recharter] only banks with 
reserve funds exceeding one billion rubles. In fact, it 
would be suitable if this suggestion were discussed by the 
appropriate authorities and made into law. In particular, the 
opening of so many new banks is reducing the status of a complex 
service of importance for our independent country just like the 
saying: "if you are going to be a bootmaker, do not be a slow 
one." 
  As I have said above, due to a lack of completely honest 
competition, it is no secret that the proliferation of new banks 
is creating difficulties for our well-established organization. 
We would like to express our feelings of thanks to the managers 
and chief bookkeepers of the "Qazaqitalqarakol" Consolidated 
Industry, "Shymkentsyra," "Shymkentsut," production unions 
carrying out the procurement and primary processing of Kazakh 
cotton, and producing oblast grain products, the grease and 
antifreeze plant, the confections factory, and the 
"Angsat-Shymkent" trade firm for withstanding the pressures and 
constraints under such conditions and remaining our customers. 
  [Qydyr] Qudaybergen, you are aware that, at the time the 
Republic law on banking was ratified at a session of the Supreme 
Kenges, there was considerable discussion about the central 
accounting clearing house. Does our Republic, which has achieved 
its independence and has entered upon the path of a market 
economy, need such a center? 
  [Seyitmambetov] This is a question which was hitherto raised 
in the Kazakh press, which only led to an exchange of opinions 
among specialists. Now as for the central clearing houses of the 
National Bank, the state bank of former times, they are one of 
the last of the tricks thought up by the state bank prior to the 
collapse of the Soviet Union to keep the republics under control 
and dependent. During June of 1991 for the first time in the 
Soviet Union such centers were established in the Republic in 
Southern Kazakhstan Oblast, without any preparations or 
preliminaries. A great deal has become known in the two years 
that have passed. As has been stated, it has become known that 
such centers are an unnecessary layer [of the banking system], 
and that they have created difficulties for the economy of our 
nation from the very beginning. Whereas clearings and exchanges 
of documents between organizations and between banks used to 
take a day at the time of the former state bank, things have now 
gotten so bad that it takes several months using the clearing 
houses within a city. 
  If is fine to go slowly and take months, but how many 
organizations are there where all traces of the funds sent have 
been "lost?" All of this is doubtless leading to the formation 
of a false image about the newly opened banks and about the 
entire banking system. The reason is that the public as whole 
does not know that all clearings are carried out solely through 
the State Bank Center... 
  I think I should mention one thing: the clearing house of 
the 
National Bank in Turkistan City got together with the governor 
of the city, and during May of last year abolished the 
operational tellers of the bank in Turkistan. The clearing house 
is itself providing payment and income services to the customers 
of the bank. Although this action is against the "Law on Banks 
in the Republic of Kazakhstan," it still continues to this day. 
We have informed the oblast administration of the National Bank 
about this illegality orally and in writing but to no avail. All 
in all, this illegal action must be very beneficial for them. 
Such illegalities are a barrier to our work. There is one more 
thing I wish to say on this issue. Prior to the neighboring 
Republic of Kyrgyzstan introducing its own currency, the 
clearing center of the state bank was abolished. I hope that we 
too are thinking of taking this step. 
  [Qydyr] Last question: it would seem as if there was 
laziness 
in the matter of training national specialists in a banking 
system from which Kazakhs have previously shied away. Why is 
there reluctance about placing national specialists, who will be 
devoted and will not go off the foreign countries after they 
have filled their purses, into the highest levels of the economy. 
  [Seyitmambetov] This is a question which should be directed 
at the leaders who are deciding the fates of specialists in our 
Republic. Let me try to answer as best I can. In order that our 
county become an independent, fully-developed nation, we must 
develop stable, well-financed, full-service banks equipped with 
the most modern technology, capable of establishing 
communications with the world banking system. That is to say, we 
must understand that banks are one of the arteries of the 
economy. This being the case, such banks should be managed by 
managers who are devoted to their nation and their people, who 
have mastered their specialties in all aspects and well, who are 
competent and knowledgeable, and young national specialists must 
be prepared for these roles. Unfortunately, we lack a tried and 
true official policy in this area. One of the most important 
questions facing young specialists is that of housing. Only if 
they have housing over their heads and a suitable salary will 
they work to their full capacities and be productive. As for our 
bank, the housing question has been settled fundamentally in the 
last two years. More than 20 young women and men have been given 
housing at company expense. The existing employees of the 
company have also not been left out of consideration. We have 
purchased in the last few years computers to ease the work of 
bank employees and to bring bank operations up to date. We, the 
bank managers, while doing things for our workers, have strongly 
maintained the work ethic. We have devoted attention in our 
organization to the learning and teaching of the official 
language, and have hired a special expert for this purpose. This 
expert, in addition to making translations, helps those learning 
Kazakh. At the same time, we gave aid last year in the amount of 
6 million rubles out of net profits to national programs and 
activities, to social organizations and to individuals with 
special needs. May this benefit people and create good will. 
  [Qydyr] Let us not forget good intentions, good works, and 
philanthropy. Thank you very much for the interview!

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Yevdokimov: "...To the Russians in </F>
Kazakhstan"] 
  [Text] Kazakhstan has launched active de-Russification 
efforts at the state policy level. Until recently public opinion 
in Russia considered that particular Republic of the former 
Soviet Union a relatively safe one. Contributing to this was in 
large part the image of Nursultan Nazarbayev, an intelligent and 
farsighted politician pursuing a moderate course. Against the 
backdrop of "ethnic cleansing" in the Baltic countries the 
de-Russification policy, at first merely of a "precautionary" 
nature (replacement of Russian city names, restrictions on the 
activities of Russian Orthodox Church congregations, severe 
curtailment of Russian-language education, etc.), seemed more 
tolerant and well-balanced. The situation changed after the 
Kazakhstani Ministry of Justice decided on 14 December 1993 to 
ban and forbid registration of all Russian communities. At 
virtually the same time criminal proceedings were begun against 
one of the leaders of the Russian community movement, 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Boris Suprunyuk, who was 
accused of "inciting interethnic strife." According to a report 
received from the Congress of Russian Communities [Kongress 
russkikh obshchin], what is happening is an intentional campaign 
against the human rights movement. This could inflame the 
situation in the Republic by prompting retaliatory acts by the 
non-Kazakh population. This is particularly true of Kazakhstan's 
northern oblasts, which historically have had a predominantly 
Russian population. In this situation much will depend on the 
position taken by Russia's leaders; it is clear that neither 
side wants another Transdniester on its hands.

<F P=106> ["Program of the National Unity of Kazakhstan Union"] </F>
  [Text] The National Unity of Kazakhstan Union is a national 
movement operating within the framework of the constitution and 
laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan and uniting on a voluntary 
basis citizens of the Republic, regardless of national 
affiliation or religious belief. 
  The SNEK [National Unity of Kazakhstan Union] advocates the 
creation of an open-type society, the building in Kazakhstan of 
a democratic state based on the rule of law, the formation of a 
social market economy, the creation of a genuine multiparty 
system, social partnership and civil harmony, political and 
internation stability, Kazakhstani patriotism, and mutual 
respect and tolerance and an increase in Kazakhstan's political 
authority in the world arena and its progress and prosperity. 
<H5>  I. Purposes and Main Directions of Activity </H5>
  The Union's political tasks have been structured with regard 
for historical, national, and geographical factors of 
Kazakhstan. Actual social institutions like the family, blood 
relations, religion, and territorial structures influence 
political processes. A particular role in Kazakhstan is 
performed by the small size of the population, the sparse 
network of cities, and the low level of availability of 
transport. Millions of people, particularly in the countryside, 
are cut off from politics. The Union supports the mobilization 
of the political will of millions of our fellow citizens and 
their involvement in the sphere of assertive political activity 
based on the ideas of stability, reforms, and civil harmony. 
  The Union advocates the creation of a grand political 
coalition in Kazakhstan in the transitional period. This 
coalition anticipates the surmounting of the confrontation 
between the government and the opposition. Whereas in stable 
democratic societies an active opposition is a condition of 
political balance, in such a transitional society as Kazakhstan 
constant opposition to the government could perform a negative 
role also. On the other hand, the opposition stands apart from 
the structures of state power. The Union proceeds from the fact 
that a political coalition is possible between equal political 
groups. Stability requires a more even distribution of power 
between the current machinery of state and the opposition 
parties and movements and close relations between them. 
  The Union proposes as a principal method of the solution of 
contradictions in the political sphere the achievement of 
consensus and social accord. Regarding itself as a political 
organization of a centrist nature, the Union rejects extremes of 
left and right. We are opposed to a situation involving the 
social opposition of various forces, which has itself been 
brought about by the growing polarization of interests. We do 
not claim to substitute for some political parties or 
organizations. Party pluralism in a democratic society is 
essential. But we are talking about something else: a mechanism 
of assuaging conflicts and political contradictions in 
present-day Kazakhstan. 
  We regard civic harmony as the unity of views of various 
political groups on specific political problems. It is obvious 
that there is some middle, central line of public thinking. This 
is a set of issues on which political groups are in accord. This 
mode of the solution of political problems is preferable to a 
solution merely by way of a simple arithmetical majority, which 
could, in turn, lead to regional conflicts. The opinion of 
political minorities cannot be ignored. Sooner or later, this 
leads to open conflict. 
  In the sphere of the political arrangement of society the 
SNEK firmly supports the formation of a state based on the rule 
of law in the form of presidential rule. And this, in our view, 
is explicable. The experience of world history shows that in an 
era of socioeconomic and political crises and upheavals an 
objective need for an increase in the regulatory role of the 
state and a strengthening of the executive appears. Our young 
state is passing through such a period. An increase in the role 
and responsibility of the executive headed by the president in 
tackling tasks pertaining to an escape from the crisis and a 
strengthening of the vertical line of management are essential 
for the pursuit of a common policy and strict coordination. 
  The SNEK advocates the speediest adoption of the Law "On 
Public Service," an increase in the responsibility of state 
officials and the mobility and efficiency of the work of the 
administrative machinery, and an improvement in the conditions 
and an enhancement of the prestige of managerial work. The Union 
considers the replacement of personnel and a reduction in the 
administrative machinery essential. 
  The Union supports a strong legislature in the shape of a 
compact professional national parliament. The SNEK believes that 
the present parliament has done a great deal in the business of 
formation of an independent Kazakhstan and the provision of a 
legislative base for the reform policy. 
  In the present times, which are complex and filled with 
anxiety for the future and concerns for a resolution of the most 
urgent problems, as in the immediate future also, for that 
matter, it is hardly possible to expect an increase in voter 
activity at the elections. This simultaneously calls very much 
in question the possibility of the efficient use at this time of 
the absolute-majority head-to-head system. One way or another, 
elections employing this system could always face the danger of 
failure. 
  The use, on the other hand, of a relative-majority 
head-to-head system, whereby the elections are considered valid 
irrespective of the number of voters who have gone to the polls 
(although, obviously, a certain minimum 
percentage--approximately 35-40 percent, in our view, will have 
to be established, all the same) and the candidate is considered 
elected if more people have voted for him than for the other 
candidates (and some minimum threshold, 25 percent, for example, 
is necessary here also, what is more), is both far more 
applicable for our conditions and far more efficient. This 
system is applied equally well for the elections of both 
independent candidates and those who have been nominated by 
political parties and grassroots associations and affords an 
opportunity for elections to be held without runoffs and a 
second round of elections entailing a decline in voter activity 
and considerable material and financial outlays. 
  As far, however, as the use at party-slate elections of the 
proportional system of determination of the results is 
concerned, it would seem entirely unsuitable in our situation. 
First, it is very hard to apply and would be comprehensible to 
far from everyone in the vast army of members of the electoral 
commissions. Confirmation of this are the repeated breakdowns at 
elections involving the use of this system by some of our former 
USSR brethren. Second, this system works well in a strongly 
politicized society with a highly developed party system, which 
we do not yet have nor will we have in the quite distant future 
even. Third, this system depersonalizes the elections to a 
certain extent, that is, the voter votes not for a specific 
personality but for a slate formed by a party, which, 
understandably, under the conditions of our democracy, which is 
in the development phase, can hardly be considered positive. Nor 
either, for that matter, can the proportional system's exclusion 
of the possibility of self-nomination for deputy. 
  For this reason it is expedient at statewide-slate elections 
also to use the relative-majority head-to-head system, which 
makes it possible to quickly and efficiently chose two deputies 
from three candidates in practically all districts. 
  It is with such an electoral system that the formation of a 
professional parliament of the Republic, whose creation, in the 
SNEK's opinion, is a most important factor of the development of 
parliamentarianism in Kazakhstan and an intensification of the 
democratic process in the Republic as a whole, becomes possible. 
  The SNEK believes that a democratic state is inconceivable 
without an autonomous, united, and independent judiciary with 
its ramified system. The Union emphasizes here the need for the 
assurance of the court's independence of the executive, 
legislative, and local authorities, the irreplaceability of 
judges, and the electivity of the court. Legal proceedings 
should be oral, swift, and direct and ensure the equality of the 
parties. The SNEK believes also that they should ensure the 
equality before the court and the law of the individual, the 
citizen, and the state and legal protection of the rights and 
liberties of citizens against the unwarranted interference of 
the state. 
  Each branch of power has its own particular authority 
enshrined by the constitution and does not duplicate or 
substitute for the other branches of power. 
  The SNEK regards man as the highest value and advocates the 
economic, spiritual, and political freedom of the individual. 
The SNEK sees as the main task of the Kazakh state respect for, 
defense of, and the creation of the conditions for the 
realization in practice of the rights of man and citizen. The 
SNEK recognizes the principles proclaimed by the UN Charter 
determining basic human rights and enshrined in the Constitution 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan: 
  recognition of the dignity inherent in all members of the 
human family and their equal and inalienable rights is the basis 
of liberty, justice, and general peace; 
  these rights ensue from the dignity inherent in the human 
personality; 
  recognition of the fact that, according to the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the ideal of the free human 
personality enjoying civil and political liberty and freedom 
from fear and want may be realized only when the conditions are 
created whereby each may avail himself of his economic, social, 
and cultural rights in the same way as his civil and political 
rights. 
  Human rights belong to each and everyone, regardless of 
civil 
affiliation and level of the material development of society. 
They are inalienable and sacrosanct. The SNEK maintains that a 
violation of human rights is always explained by political, not 
economic, factors. As distinct from civil rights, the extent of 
which is predetermined by the specific possibilities and 
development of society. 
<H5>  II. Economic Platform </H5>
  In the transitional period the SNEK sees as the main task of 
its economic platform the adoption of effective measures to lead 
the economy of Kazakhstan out of the devastating economic crisis 
and the pursuit of an active policy for protecting against 
inflation the commodity producers and the entire population, for 
a halt to the decline in production and its subsequent upturn, 
and for the social protection of poor and needy citizens. 
  The SNEK advocates the creation of a Kazakh model of 
economic 
development ensuing from the particular geopolitical location of 
Kazakhstan and the availability of a rich storehouse of natural 
resources and skilled and educated personnel potential. The 
Kazakhstan model of the economy should aspire to imbibe all that 
is most valuable contained in the experience of the economic 
reforms of other countries and take account primarily of the 
economic interests of the Republic. The SNEK believes that the 
raw material focus of our economy can and should benefit, not 
harm, the Republic and be the foundation of a restructuring of 
production in the direction of manufacturing industry. 
  The SNEK advocates the fair privatization of state property 
excluding the alienation of various groups of the population of 
Kazakhstan from the basic producer goods on a racial, national, 
socio-class, property, territorial, or some other basis. The 
privatization process should provide for equal access to assets 
about to be privatized for all citizens of the Republic. The 
state and glasnost should be the guarantor of fair privatization. 
  The Union regards corruption as a dangerous phenomenon for 
society and a crime. For this reason it supports an 
intensification of the fight against organized crime. With 
regard for the corresponding international agreements and 
recommendations pertaining to the fight against corruption it is 
essential to make immediate adjustments to the current 
legislative instruments to create more effective conditions of 
the organization of the work on uncovering, forestalling, and 
putting a stop to the activity of corrupt criminal groups. The 
Union advocates special laws making provision for concerted 
measures of the fight against these phenomena. It is essential 
also to extend the rights and strengthen the personnel 
composition of the law enforcement authorities and to contribute 
to an enhancement of its professional level. 
  The SNEK believes that it is essential to consistently and 
resolutely fight against corruption in the sphere of 
privatization, against the notorious "grab-ization." 
  The SNEK supports a policy of the utmost encouragement of 
private enterprise and small and medium-sized business. In order 
for the program of support for enterprise proclaimed by the 
government to be realized it is essential to reconsider the 
practice of privileged taxation and the allocation of loans for 
private enterprise. We need in this sphere to create propitious 
conditions for entrepreneurs for stimulating a growth of 
production and the productive accumulation and investment of 
capital in promising and socially significant sectors of 
production. We proceed from the priority of productive 
enterprise over commercial, speculative business and will 
further its development by all forces at our disposal. 
  The SNEK proceeds from the fact that the present system of 
pricing is in need of radical revision. We will pursue a 
flexible and differentiated price policy. The SNEK believes that 
it is essential in respect to the public sector and monopoly 
enterprises and also energy producers to set strict limits on 
the growth of prices. An unchecked increase in the prices of 
their products leads to a growth of inflation and an increase in 
the price of all commodities. In the nonstate sector prices 
should be established freely, and the government may control 
prices here only with the aid of indirect levers: taxes, bank 
credit, and customs privileges and restrictions. 
  In the sphere of finances, monetary circulation, and credit 
in the Republic a critical situation caused both by the general 
crisis of the economy and the ill-considered steps of the 
government has taken shape. In the financial and credit sphere 
the SNEK will in the transitional period unswervingly pursue a 
policy of a recovery of the financial system, a reduction in the 
budget deficit, the formation of a prudent and flexible tax 
system, liberalization of the banking system, and a recovery of 
monetary circulation. The SNEK believes that to achieve the said 
goal it is essential: 
  to reform the tax system and to switch to a system of 
taxation providing for a transition from the fiscal to 
stimulatory focus of taxes. Tax policy should be stable and 
civilized with a broad base of taxation and favorable to the 
proprietors, producers, and the state and should be working to 
supplant the criminal circulation of cash and noncash 
transactions; 
  to immediately reform the credit and banking system in the 
direction of the creation of most-favored status for enterprise. 
The banking system should provide for a flexible, differentiated 
credit policy, soft loans for the priority sectors, the funding 
of research developments, and the introduction of promising 
production engineering programs in the Republic's economy; 
  to provide for the indexing of personal monetary savings 
held 
in savings banks and to raise the deposit interest rate to 
protect them against inflationary support [as published] and to 
attract investments in the economy; 
  to protect the country's economic interests and safeguard 
its 
economic independence and security it is essential to perform 
preparatory work on the introduction of a national currency. 
  The impossibility of an independent escape under the 
conditions of the postcommunist devastation and the collapse of 
interrepublic business relations from the most severe economic 
crisis prompted Kazakhstan to sign the treaty on the economic 
union of CIS countries and to stay within the ruble zone. The 
Union hopes that the treaty will serve as a foundation for new 
genuinely mutually profitable and equal economic relations and 
support the continued materialization of the country's 
independence in the interests of all Kazakhstanis. 
  In the transitional period the state should render financial 
support only to the priority base sectors of production 
possessing high export potential and providing for the 
scientific and technical and technological updating of the 
entire economy. 
  The SNEK is opposed to the atomization of government funds 
around various sectors and departments and supports their 
concentration and directed and rational use in the most limited 
number of priority sectors possible: the oil and gas complex, 
the agro-industrial complex, the conversion mechanical 
engineering complex, and utility systems. 
  The Union consistently advocates the structural 
reorganization and accelerated technological renewal of material 
production. The SNEK sees as its task the pursuit of a 
structural and scientific and technological policy which makes 
it possible to accomplish a leap forward in technology and 
upgrade enterprises' hopelessly obsolete fixed capital to world 
standards. The SNEK is for the re-industrialization of industry 
in the promising areas reflecting the long-term conditions of 
the world market. 
  The paramount task is the acceleration of investments in the 
manufacturing research-intensive sectors completing a production 
engineering cycle: mechanical engineering, petrochemical, 
electronics, and aerospace industry and instrument making. 
  Kazakhstan has quite powerful scientific and technological 
groundwork in Aktau, Leninsk, Kurchatov, Stepnogorsk, and other 
industrial cities servicing the military-industrial complex. 
  The SNEK is for conversion and the switch of the 
military-industrial complex to service of the Republic's 
economy, the formation on this basis of technology and science 
parks and engineering-research centers and the preservation and 
multiplication of the existing scientific and technological and 
personnel potential, preservation of the technopolises that have 
evolved, and the high moral and material status of the highly 
skilled engineering-technical personnel and specialists. 
  The SNEK advocates the formation of a self-sufficient 
domestic market and reduced technological and commodity 
dependence on monopolists, which individual countries have 
become following the disintegration of the USSR as a result of 
the uneven location of the productive forces on the territory of 
the former Union republics. 
  Integration in the world economy is a decisive condition of 
the creation of an efficiently operating economic system. For 
this reason the SNEK advocates in the sphere of foreign economic 
policy the continued simplification and liberalization of the 
conditions of the attraction of foreign capital to the economy 
of the Republic within limits determined by the interests of 
assurance of its economic security. In order for foreign capital 
to have an interest in investing in Kazakhstan's economy it is 
essential to create precise legal guarantees for the protection 
of foreign investments. 
<H5>  III. Social Policy </H5>
  The SNEK advocates social partnership and the creation of 
the 
traditions and institutions of partner relations between the 
state and the citizen and employer and employee. The SNEK is for 
the resolution of problems that arise by way of civilized 
dialogue which prevents an increase in social tension. It is 
necessary to use the available potential of social policy itself 
for harmonization of the interests of different social groups. 
In addition, we consider necessary the creation of arbitral 
organizations which defend the interests of the contracting 
parties. The Union is for collective contracts and collective 
agreements concluded annually at all levels among the 
government, the employers, and the working people. The SNEK is 
for the enactment of the corresponding law. 
  The entire system of social protection of the population at 
the present stage of the development of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan should be geared to a halt to the process of decline 
in people's living standard and the creation of the conditions 
for an upturn in the latter. For this the SNEK considers it 
essential to revise the entire state ideology of social 
protection and the attitude toward it as something secondary. 
The new model of social policy, which the SNEK will champion, 
presupposes implementation of the following measures: 
  the balanced economic and social development of the cities 
and regions; 
  the decisive surmounting of the residual principle of 
investment in the social sphere; 
  substitution of the formulation of major priority strategic 
goals and the solution of fundamental social problems for the 
customary practice of "patching up holes" and "putting out 
social fires" (stoppages, strikes and so forth); 
  the concentration of attention and resources on the solution 
of a limited number of questions reflecting society's "sore" 
points; 
  renunciation of the overall impersonal format of the 
accomplishment of social tasks on a Republic scale and a 
differentiated approach to the social problems of town and 
country, different regions, small and large cities, and 
demographic and professional groups of the populace. 
  The SNEK believes that the formation and realization in 
practice of a new model of social protection rejecting a 
leveling and residual approach to the problem as a general 
principle would be the basis on which the social orientation of 
the economy could be achieved. The SNEK is for a fundamental 
revision of the current principle, when the lot of the vast 
majority of the people has been uniform poverty, and a thin 
stratum of the elite which has monopolized the administration of 
social life has satisfied its social requirements at a 
relatively high level. We believe that it is essential to 
radically change the organizational structures and sources of 
funding of the nonproduction sphere (health care, education, 
pensions, and housing and municipal services) and to reform the 
system of distribution of income as a whole. Personal income 
should be regulated via the system of taxation and other 
economic regulators. The SNEK is for the development of diverse 
systems of insurance as supplementary channels of social 
protection. 
  The SNEK believes that the number of "clients" of social 
assistance should be sharply narrowed thanks to the provision of 
all groups of the population with decent living conditions based 
on active economic behavior and the formation of an effective 
mechanism of social security and social insurance. The SNEK is 
for each person being accorded economic freedom of the 
individual and for the creation of incentives to labor for the 
economically active population. All channels of the stimulation 
of economic behavior and the encouragement of personal economic 
initiative should be engaged. 
  The SNEK will support social safeguards in respect to 
unemployment and the creation of a national fund for assistance 
to the unemployed, the handicapped, the poor, and orphans. The 
SNEK proposes conversion of the system of social protection in 
the following areas: 
  a ban on a freeze on wages for low-income categories of 
employees, the publicly funded categories primarily; 
  the immediate introduction of an officially established 
poverty threshold determined by the minimum consumer basket and 
its regular indexation (with regard for the real rate of 
inflation, not less than quarterly); 
  government guarantees of the social security of the citizen 
and the establishment of the strict specificity of social 
support, when it is channeled to those who cannot provide for 
themselves and their families; 
  a streamlining of the system of social protection, the 
elimination of unjustified payments, and differentiation of the 
payable benefits; 
  the creation of an integrated system of guarantees of social 
protection at all levels of the Republic, oblasts, rayons, 
enterprises, and plant outfits; 
  a combination of the state system of social protection with 
mechanisms of social security at the enterprises; 
decentralization of the funding of social programs thanks to a 
shift in the center of gravity to nonstate structures and also 
to local organs of administration and the enterprises; 
  compensation for loss of wages, pensions, allowances, and 
grants from inflation and an increase in the price of consumer 
goods and services which make up the subsistence minimum; the 
adoption of measures for the practical realization of and 
unswerving compliance with laws adopted previously: "On 
Indexation of Monetary Income With Regard for the Increase in 
the Price of Consumer Goods and Services," "On Protection of the 
Rights of Consumers," "On the Minimum Consumer Budget," and 
others; the introduction of indexation of the minimum wage; 
  increased social assistance for needy citizens who have lost 
their jobs as a consequence of the reorganization of production 
and reductions in personnel; 
  the accelerated development of the system of social 
safeguards in the sphere of the minimum wage, pensions, 
allowances, payments and benefits, and the right to work and 
free education and medical services. 
  The Union recognizes the priority of the legitimate 
interests 
of the citizens over the interests of manufacturers and vendors. 
The SNEK believes that protection of the consumer against 
dangers to his life and health is an urgent task and advocates 
the implementation by the organs of state power and 
administration of efficient measures connected with the 
protection of the personal rights of the consumers in terms of 
their provision with high-quality commodities, jobs, and 
services. 
  In the sphere of employment policy the SNEK will strive to 
minimize the level of unemployment thanks to the development of 
jobs and contribute to the employment of and support for 
employees laid off in the course of the structural 
reorganization of the economy and the transition to market 
relations. Particular attention will be paid to state programs 
of the employment and retraining of citizens laid off from their 
former jobs. This should, of course, be undertaken by the state 
with the assistance of a specially created network of courses of 
instruction, schools, and so forth. Provision should be made for 
tax and other privileges here for enterprises providing for the 
reorientation of laid-off employees and securing a growth of 
productivity. 
  The SNEK will promote the organization of the vocational 
education of the youth, the creation of jobs for specialists, 
and privileges for them in the construction of housing and the 
priority promotion of enterprising people to elective 
production-management positions. It is essential to pay more 
attention to the social problems of the youth and to stimulate 
young people's entrepreneurial activity. 
  The position of retirees has been distorted for many years. 
"Old people are held in respect with us everywhere"--this myth 
was taken to be the reality. The attitude toward them as 
dependents determined the fallaciousness of the direction of 
development of the pension system. The fact that the appointed 
pension is fixed and does not take account of the increase in 
the cost of living is a serious shortcoming. It is necessary, 
therefore, to index the pensions depending on the growth of the 
consumer price index and the increase in the minimum wage in the 
national economy. Provision should be made for the guaranteed 
purchase by retirees, mothers of large families, and so forth of 
dairy, meat, and bread products and baby food at fixed official 
prices. 
  All the above-mentioned types of safeguards should be 
realized at all enterprises, regardless of forms of ownership. 
In addition, the SNEK considers essential the elaboration and 
adoption of a law guaranteeing social protection at private 
enterprises. 
  The SNEK believes that government support for science, 
education, and culture is essential and that they should be 
accorded tax privileges. The opening of public and private 
educational institutions is encouraged. The Union advocates 
autonomy for the higher educational institutions and a 
broadening of the rights of student self-government. The SNEK is 
for a cardinal reform of education in the countryside, an 
increase in government appropriations for the development of the 
physical plant of the rural schools, and a rise in the 
professional level and prestige of the teacher. We believe that 
basic research should be funded by the state. 
  The Union advocates the creation of conditions conducive to 
the dynamic progress of all branches of learning and the 
concentration of personnel and material and financial resources 
in the most promising areas designed to accelerate the 
achievement of economic and social aims and the spiritual 
development of society. 
<H5>  IV. Nationality Policy </H5>
  The SNEK proceeds in its nationality policy from the fact 
that Kazakhstan represents a complex, multinational society. The 
experience of mononational countries does not work in our case, 
therefore. In all countries that have achieved independence the 
national movement has performed and will continue to perform a 
tremendous role. But two models of the defense of national 
interest are possible. The first is based on a radical and most 
rapid change in the balance of interests in favor of one's own 
nation, which is fraught with conflicts. The second is based on 
evolutionary development with the equality of all nationalities 
and ethnic groups and the achievement of harmony, with 
recognition of the fact that on certain issues the Kazakh 
nation, by virtue of the fact that Kazakhstan is the sole 
statehood for Kazakhs, has priority. Considering that ethnic 
social conflicts could be an impediment to the development of 
all nations, we opt for the second path of development. This 
means that the Union is opposed in principle to the substitution 
for one negative form of the political mobilization of the 
masses of another, that is, replacement of the "socialist" 
principle of mass support by the "national" principle and the 
substitution for class diktat of national diktat. 
  The Union will seek the formation of the conditions for the 
unhindered realization of the creative potential of each 
nationality and ethnic group, the full-fledged development of 
their national cultures, language, customs, and traditions, the 
preservation and development of folklore, and support for the 
ethnical and rational principles in the systems of national 
education as a part of general pedagogics. 
  The Union will struggle actively against all manifestations 
of national exclusiveness, nationalism, and chauvinism. 
  The Union will not accept any forms of national enmity and 
is 
opposed to national-radical methods in policy and supports the 
resolution of internation, religious, and other contradictions 
and conflicts by measures based on mutual respect and national 
and religious tolerance. 
  The SNEK is for observance of the rights of man, nations, 
and 
ethnic groups recognized by the world community and for national 
minorities being afforded equal opportunities for the 
preservation and development of ethnic, linguistic, and 
religious distinctiveness without any discrimination. 
  The SNEK advocates state support for national-cultural 
centers-cum-organizational structures adequately expressing 
specific requirements of the nationalities constituting the 
people of Kazakhstan. National-cultural centers, in the SNEK's 
view, are concentrated forms of the expression of national 
distinctiveness and ethnic self-awareness and an important 
institution of the incipient civil society in polyethnic 
Kazakhstan making it possible to conduct a dialogue between the 
nations in a spirit of national mutual understanding and mutual 
respect. State support for the national-cultural centers is a 
principal method of development of the national cultures and 
contributes to the achievement of actual stability as an 
essential condition of the resolution of national and 
internation problems and the achievement of civic peace and 
internation harmony. 
  The formation of real conditions for the full-fledged 
development of the national cultures of all nationalities of the 
Republic without exception ensuring the political stability of 
polyethnic Kazakhstan is the basis for the conception of Kazakh 
patriotism, a sense by the representatives of all nationalities 
of involvement in the historical destiny of their 
motherland--the Republic of Kazakhstan--and assertive action for 
its modernization and prosperity. 
  The SNEK supports the state self-determination of the Kazakh 
nation and its continued infusion with real content, which is a 
most important factor of the consolidation of both the Kazakh 
nation itself and all of Kazakhstani society. The unity of the 
Kazakh people and their increased democratic potential in the 
political life of the Republic is not only their own concern but 
also that of the other nationalities of our country since the 
former's political, cultural, economic, and moral health as the 
biggest ethnic entity in the state is an important stabilizing 
factor in the integration of Kazakhstani society for the 
accomplishment of the tasks of the modernization of Kazakhstan 
and the building of a democratic society based on the rule of 
law. Internation solidarity with the Kazakh people and an 
understanding of their problems is important here also. On the 
other hand, the activity of the Kazakh people on the development 
of their statehood, language, and culture should be determined 
by the level of development of national duty, national 
obligation, and national conscience understood as a moral 
imperative before the other nationalities. Without moral 
responsibility and dignity the building of national statehood by 
the Kazakh people becomes national egotism transforming national 
statehood into an ethnocratic society, the result of which would 
be the irreversible disintegration of polyethnic Kazakhstan and 
the loss of national statehood itself. Such a thing is, of 
course, impermissible both from the standpoints of the essential 
interests of the Kazakh nation itself and of the other 
nationalities constituting the people of Kazakhstan. For this 
reason solidarity between the nationalities of Kazakhstani 
society should be a principle of community life and a most 
important factor of the integration of our polyethnic state 
given by history and the fatherland common to all of us. 
  The SNEK believes that a practicable method of overcoming 
internation conflicts consists not of political confrontation, 
which could drag on for decades, but of entirely different 
mechanisms. 
  The first consists of the creation of a new economic 
environment. Continued economic crisis would lead to a growth of 
political tension and increased unemployment, particularly among 
the youth. Without the creation of a strong private-enterprise 
sector it will be impossible to overcome the crisis on the labor 
market and ensure a sufficiently high level of unemployment. 
  The second mechanism is the creation of the conditions for 
gradual cultural integration. The relationship of the main 
national community and the related national communities 
affiliated to it is at this stage in many aspects not at the 
"intercourse" level, when there is a mutual exchange of cultural 
content, but is characterized by the phase of the "circulation" 
of cultural content within each national culture. It is 
essential to achieve mutual integration. With the practically 
universal knowledge of Russian the integrating functions of 
Kazakh are manifestly insufficient. The SNEK views this problem 
from the viewpoint of integrating, unifying functions. The 
Kazakh language and culture should be a powerful factor of the 
integration of all Kazakhstanis. This would in itself do away 
with a mass of political problems. It is the strategic line to 
which our Union adheres. But we are emphatically opposed to 
bureaucratic arbitrary action implanting its methods of 
imposition of the Kazakh language without regard for the actual 
situation and by way of artificial acceleration. 
  The third mechanism is connected with the prevention of 
internation conflicts. We are talking about a combination of 
three factors: a truly scientific study of national relations, 
the pressure of public opinion on these relations and mechanisms 
of the emergency response to internation conflicts. As distinct 
from the sham or emotional approach to internation problems in 
Kazakhstan, the Union is oriented toward the systematic dialogue 
of different groups and viewpoints, an objective analysis of the 
causes of internation conflicts, and the active use of the mass 
media not for inciting nationalism and chauvinism but for a 
constructive escape from the crisis situations. The Union is 
oriented also toward the objective coverage of internation 
relations in Kazakhstan on the part of foreign media. The SNEK 
is oriented toward cooperation with both national and foreign 
mass media for the curtailment of provocative and negative 
influences on the public consciousness in the plane of 
internation relations. 
<H5>  V. Foreign Policy Reference Points </H5>
  The SNEK believes that the main purpose of foreign policy 
should be all-around support for international stability and 
Kazakhstan's security for the evolutionary development of 
domestic reforms. 
  The SNEK supports the peace-making efforts of the Republic's 
leadership in respect to a settlement of conflicts in the CIS. 
The SNEK understands that the threat to peace today arises from 
local conflicts. For this reason the Union deems it necessary to 
find and adopt solutions before they have begun to escalate and 
involve third countries. 
  For preventing an escalation of tension in Central Asia the 
SNEK advocates: 
  a process of negotiations between states on problems that 
arise; 
  states' freedom of choice of their particular path of 
political and socioeconomic development; 
  unswerving observance of the principle of noninterference in 
one another's internal affairs; 
  common sense in foreign policy. 
  The SNEK believes that the Republic should continue to 
support the inviolability of borders and the right to the 
defense of sovereignty of each state, of new countries 
particularly. The diversion into a struggle for a recarving of 
borders, the tearing away of territories, and internal conflicts 
are not only causing enormous losses economically but also, 
which is far more tragic, numerous human casualties. A gradual 
normalization of relations based on simple and comprehensible 
principles would ensure the free development of all countries of 
the region. 
  The SNEK supports Kazakhstan's breakthrough into the world 
community. Membership of the United Nations and other 
international organizations is creating the conditions for 
realization of the reforms. But we are opposed to imposition of 
development models on the Republic. We understand that 
principles that have been worked out over many centuries are not 
always applicable under qualitatively different conditions. No 
state and no society can become something new immediately. 
  The SNEK is opposed to: 
  a solution of international problems by the power method; 
  a disregard for the interests of the developing and new 
states by the big powers; 
  the use of force on international issues; 
  interference in a state's internal affairs; 
  the imposition of various models of development on the new 
states, however attractive they may be; 
  wars bringing ruin and innumerable casualties. 
  For the realization of these propositions in the sphere of 
foreign policy it is essential: 
  to perform active work; understand that pressure could be 
fatal and just as harmful as a mistaken policy; 
  to recognize and abide strictly by commitments that have 
been 
assumed and to display a prudent patience and understanding; 
  to establish in relations the principle of observance of 
noninterference in one another's internal affairs; 
  to devise an international system of the early detection of 
conflicts and of preventive diplomacy. 
  For contacts between the democratic forces of various 
countries of the region the SNEK considers essential the 
extensive development of the cooperation of center parties and 
movements in the CIS. Today the policy of centrism is a 
foundation of a settlement of the domestic political situation 
and the stabilization of international relations. The exchange 
of experience, joint consultations, and the coordination of 
common efforts in support of reforms are an important supplement 
to the processes of democratization in all countries. 
  The SNEK proposes the elaboration and discussion of a 
concept 
of the foreign policy and a concept of the defense of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan which include the following points: 
  the foreign policy of Kazakhstan should ensure guarantees of 
international stability and internation accord for the pursuit 
of reform policy and the achievement of the Republic's economic 
independence; 
  a policy of common sense in relations with our immediate 
neighbors and the pursuit of an active, pragmatic foreign policy 
aimed at the most extensive participation possible in the 
settlement of conflicts and the establishment of equal, mutually 
beneficial economic and political relations; 
  assurance of the unity of domestic and foreign policy; 
mobilization of the efforts of economic policy for the country's 
incorporation in the international division of labor and an 
acceleration of economic innovations in the economic system of 
Kazakhstan; 
  the use of participation in international organizations to 
attract the resources of other countries for a solution of 
domestic problems. 
  Foreign policy is directly connected with the domestic 
situation. In this connection the SNEK believes that the 
assurance of domestic stability and security is a key component 
of the problem of national security. The SNEK considers it 
necessary to struggle to ensure that a threat to peace, our 
neighbors, and the people of Kazakhstan themselves not arise on 
our own territory. 
  The SNEK believes that there should be a solution to our 
problems not so much thanks to assistance from outside as thanks 
to the mobilization of internal possibilities. Kazakhstan has a 
base sufficiently well prepared for the introduction of modern 
equipment and technology. But it is by no means necessary for 
this to follow the lead of some state or group of states. 
Kazakhstan should not have a one-sided foreign policy 
orientation. We have a single goal--peace and stability and 
cooperation between countries and peoples. Each state and each 
people should make their contribution to this process.

<F P=106> [Article by Tursynbay Zhandawlet: "Department of </F>
Migration."] 
  [Text] One third of all Kazakhs live outside the Republic. 
We must be unsparing in the help we offer to our kinsmen who 
long for their homeland and long to return and claim their 
heritage. In these hard times it is extremely difficult not to 
migrate from one country to another and from one village to 
another. However, it is fitting that we extend a helping hand to 
our kinsmen in areas where the flames of war are burning where 
there is environmental disaster. The Migration Department under 
the Ministry of Labor provides such aid and operates for the 
purpose of rendering specific assistance to our Kazakh relatives 
who desire to return to their homeland. 
  We have a duty not only to bring our kinsmen home, but to 
supply them with residential housing and with work. In so doing 
we must bear in mind the situation of our government, with its 
tightened purse strings and difficulties in local economies. For 
that reason, having looked into the above circumstances, our 
President has set quotas (numbers) for those migrating to 
Kazakhstan. Thus, a quota is set for 1993 of 10,000 families 
moving to Kazakhstan. It is well known that limits are placed 
today among independent nations on the tendency towards 
uncontrolled migration and that migration processes are advanced 
only under the limitations of the laws established by each 
country. 
  Thus at present the return of Kazakhs living outside of 
Kazakhstan to their homeland is carried out through the 
Migration Department. For that reason, Kazakhs living outside 
the country communicate directly with this department, make 
known what oblast in Kazakhstan they wish to migrate to, tell 
what their needs are, and come to an agreement with the 
department. It is possible that not only individual families, 
but a clan, a village, or a settlement will get together and 
jointly write a letter. If they establish direct connections 
with that department, specific help is given to those migrating. 
For example, the expenses of shipping their goods are met. 
However, documents confirming travel expenses for this purpose 
(ticket stubs, receipts) must be shown. 
  Migrants are sent to the appropriate settlement according to 
their own request or according to the instructions of the 
Ministry of Labor. Enterprise heads of the area where they go 
provide them the needed assistance. They must provide them with 
housing, or, if this is impossible, they must provide them with 
a plot of land to build a house and with a loan needed to buy 
construction materials. However, the amount of the loan should 
not exceed 5 million rubles. In rural areas, they are given a 
cow and 10-15 sheep, according to what is economically possible. 
Separate from this, a seasonal payment-in-aid is paid to the 
head of a family of migrants at a rate 15 times the average 
lowest salary and to the remaining members of the family at a 
rate 7 times the lowest average salary. 
  Divisions of the Migration Department have been established 
in every oblast. Those migrating can apply to the migration 
division in the oblast directly regarding any special problems 
they encounter. We believe that the situation has been brought 
under control and a stop has been put to the confused flow of 
too many newcomers. Indeed, foreigners have equal rights with 
Republic citizens under the law to buy housing. It would seem to 
be necessary, while correcting and improving law in this area, 
to specify under what circumstances foreigners have a right to 
buy housing and when they do not. As is shown by the practices 
of other democratic countries, every country has full rights to 
carry out a migration and visa policy convenient for itself. 
Limitation of those coming to a country is also not contrary to 
international law. It appears that the documents of all of those 
migrating are to be delivered for review by workers of the 
Migration Department through the divisions of this organization. 
What this means is that such things as illegal registration and 
housing purchase will not be allowed. 
  There are areas in migration where we do "the best we can." 
For example, some migrants understand their return to their 
homeland differently and want an apartment in the center of 
Almaty out of turn or demand a free house in the vicinity of the 
capital. These things, in fact, do not happen. 
  Up to the present the Migration Department has done a number 
of good things: it has assisted 3,000 families from Mongolia 
this year, 300 from Iran, and 5,000-6,000 from CIS countries. 
Plans are for the migration of a thousand families from Iran and 
Turkey in the future. At present the department is devoting 
special attention to evacuating Kazakhs in regions afflicted by 
war or conflict. The reasons are understandable. 
  Shortage of financing is creating barriers to the 
development 
of Migration Department services. The fates of so many Kazakhs 
and the beating of a hot heart longing for the homeland are 
connected with migration. For that reason full financial support 
is needed for this areas. 
  It would be proper that, in addition to counting tasks 
accomplished, we look to the future of such immigration for a 
moment. We note that our reception of migrants is still without 
reproach, compared to how Germans returning to the homeland are 
received there. There are so many things we should do in this 
area. I am hoping for a time when we will receive our returning 
kinsmen by doing everything possible for them like a truly 
civilized and cultured countries. So said Nurlan Raqymzhanov, 
deputy chief of the Migration Department. Some of our kinsmen, 
while they know how to speak Kazakh, do not know how to write 
Kazakh using the Cyrillic script, or they lack the needed 
specialties. In addition, when we bear in mind many 
peculiarities and differences in customs of our Republic, there 
should be centers to acclimatize and teach migrants. At the very 
least it would be proper to organize courses lasting three-four 
months. [Policy] directions are needed for the entire migration 
system. 
  One thing I want to mention at the end, lest any 
misconceptions be created, is that there is no prohibition 
preventing our kinsmen from migrating on their own without 
informing the department. However, it would indeed be good to 
remember that migrating through the department is considerably 
more convenient.

<F P=106> [Review by Ayzhan Qapayeva of demographer Maqash Tatimov's </F>
book "Qazaq Alemi:" "History To Dispel Sorrow."] 
  [Text] The "Atamura" Press his published the book of 
scientist-demographer Maqash Tatimov called "Qazaq Alemi" [World 
of the Kazakhs]. 
  Having become a people left behind by time, who atrophied as 
a whole as a result of three centuries of a colonialist yoke, of 
being driven from their lands, and of great bloody massacres, 
our demographic numbers have grown rapidly during recent years 
and we are making up for our losses. Creation of geopolitical 
and demopolitical notions appropriate to our young Republic, 
which in terms of its expanse is one of the largest countries in 
the world but in terms of its population is fiftieth among 175 
UN member nations, is a requirement of the times. From this 
point of view, noted scientist-demographer Maqash Tatimov's 
recently published book entitled: "Qazaq Alemi" is an extremely 
important work intended to make clear the weight of the Kazakh 
people among the peoples of the world, to investigate key 
questions involved with the formation of demopolitical notions, 
and to distinguish in detail the eras of demographic development 
from early times up to the present day. 
  In the first chapters of the book, the author touches in 
detail on the demographic determinism which has had such a 
tremendous impact upon the national development and prosperity 
of the Kazakh people, that is to say, on the causes of its 
dependency. He offers specific scientific proofs as to why the 
Kazakh people were deprived of a total of 5,950,000 persons as a 
result of the destruction of Kazakh nationhood and the total 
breakup of the Kazakhs over a period of three centuries 
(1690-1990), beginning from the great disaster of "putting one 
foot before the other in the snow, the Alqakol deviation" [wars 
with the Dzungars]. 
  In the next chapter which discusses the view of foreign 
scientists on the demographic state of the Kazakhs, the author 
criticizes foreign scientists in terms the inherent laws of 
demographic growth for endeavoring to compare to with another 
peoples at different levels of historical development. 
  The conclusion that during the next two-three decades (by 
2025), if things go well, "the number of our people will reach 
15 million and will comprise two-thirds of all the inhabitants 
of our Republic," creates feelings of joy within us. 
  According to data assembled by M. Tatimov, based upon 
archival documents, 2.5 million were wiped out during the years 
1921-2 and from 1931-3 due to hunger. Nearly half a million fled 
to foreign countries during the era of forced collectivization 
and confiscation, and many thousands of innocent people were 
shot during the holocaust of the Goloshchekin genocide and 
Stalinist repression. All in all, our people were deprived of 
3.5 million persons during this sad destruction lasting 30 
years. The author explains: "this was one of the major excesses 
of the colonialists in the 20th century." He points out that 
thinking about ways to overcome the damages from this gradually 
and to improve demographic conditions in our country is an 
honored duty of our nation. 
  As if to "put on a little weight," the numbers of our 
people, 
having suffered complete demographic disaster, started out from 
very low levels and are today well over 7 million in our own 
Republic and well over 10 million in the entire world. The 
demographer invites the more than 3 million our blood relatives 
living in almost 40 countries of the world to assemble under the 
black yurt [of Kazakhstan] and to return to the honored 
homeland. In fact, the time has arrived for numbers and quality 
to grow together. The idea of numbers and quality "must become 
the nucleus for national patriotism, our national psychology, 
and our state ideology," Tatimov concludes. 
  The lands of Central Asia and of Kazakhstan are a region 
where the progeny of the Turkic-speaking peoples, which are 
broadly spread and dispersed about the great Eurasian expanses, 
have grown up and matured. The next chapter of the book presents 
tables about the demographic growth of the six major countries 
of Central Asia and Kazakhstan during a 112 year period 
(1897-2009) and shows us a difficult fate, a varied history. In 
terms the middle range of the demographer scientist's 
projections, the number of Turks in the entire world will grow 
2.5-3.0 times and reach a number of 400-450 millions [by the end 
of the above period]. 
  It makes the author shudder that the Kazakh people have 
still 
not been raised to the ranks of leaders in urbanization which is 
gaining ground among the developed countries of the world. 
According to calculations based upon the results of censuses at 
various times, the number of Kazakhs living in cities increased 
between the years 1891 and 1989 from 40,000 to 3,280,000, an 
increase of 82 times. It greatly shocks the scientist that 
migration is onesided, that the fact that our young people 
coming to the cities disappear down a blind alley, and that they 
are unable to establish themselves on a solid basis. This is 
having an adverse impact upon our demographic thinking and 
conduct and upon our growth. 
  One of the demographic disaster areas which took shape in 
the 
Republic with the organization of the Soviet red imperialism was 
the nuclear testing area in Semey. The testing area, according 
to an explanation provided by the scientist, made the Kazakh 
people a social toy of the red empire, an economic toy, a 
sacrifice to gain experience with nuclear weapons. It was a 
coarse barbarism directed at our growth and development. Through 
offering the truth of long years about the Degeleng Mountains, 
which rumbled from below and became ill-starred, the author 
brings to our attention the harm to the people's growth caused 
by the nuclear explosions and adds his own suggestions for 
overcoming the ill effects of this contrary manifestation 
quickly. 
  In the next chapter of the book: "Final Words on a Black 
Document," secrets are uncovered, a terrible sadness to move the 
soul. One other barbarism, a very severe disaster for the 
history of the Kazakh people, was the Stalinist repression. 
  There is no doubt whatever that the facts and demographic 
projections of demographic science are extremely important. In 
this regard information, showing detailed modeling of all 
aspects of the demographic development of our people and showing 
projections about future growth, is provided very appropriately 
at the end of the book. These facts will no doubt have a greater 
influence on the minds of our people than words of simple 
information.

<F P=106> [Interview with Davlat Usmon, Tajik Opposition Leader, by </F>
Ra'fat Yahya in Islamabad, date not given: "Ready to Negotiate 
With the Russians and Friendly Sides for Settlement"] 
  [Text] Tajik Opposition Leader Davlat Usmon has told 
AL-HAYAH that he is ready to negotiate about the Tajik crisis on 
condition that it be with the Russians, rather than with what he 
called "the agent government" in Dushanbe. Davlet Usmon, who is 
considered the organizational brain of the Tajik opposition, 
said that the opposition's readiness to negotiate had resulted 
from pressure from "several friendly parties" he did not name. 
He may have been referring to Pakistan and Afghanistan. He added 
that the Tajik opposition had always sought to solve problems 
through peaceful means; it was the communists who had driven 
them to bear arms. 
  Davlat Usmon said that he was not fighting the Tajik army, 
but Russian forces--25,000 soldiers and officers. He said that 
there were other forces from Uzbekistan, who, he said, "were 
also taking an active part fighting against us." Davlat Usmon, 
who recently came from the front, said that his forces had 
inflicted large human and material losses on the Russian army, 
with 900 killed and the destruction of a large number of tanks, 
guns, and ammunition dumps. Davlat Usmon is seen as the number 
two man in the Islamic Revival Party; he had taken the post of 
deputy prime minister in the coalition government formed by 
democrats and Islamists before the communists took power. 
AL-HAYAH conducted the following interview with him in 
Islamabad, where he was en route back to his country from Sudan, 
where he had been attending a conference. 
  [Yahya] Two years ago, we met you in Dushanbe, and you said 
that communist forces in Tajikistan were finished, and that the 
Tajik people supported the Islamic forces led by the Revival 
Party. But the current situation in Tajikistan would suggest the 
opposite. 
  [Usmon] I still stand by what I said. The Tajik people still 
stand by us. We now control 70 percent of Tajikistan. The 
military situation is in our favor, and we still retain the 
fighting initiative. 
  [Yahya] But military reports say that the Tajik Government 
is 
in control of the situation, and that your losses are mounting. 
  [Usmon] I came back a few days ago from inside Tajikistan 
after having spent about four months supervising the course of 
military operations. We have achieved major victories in this 
period, which I can summarize for you as follows: 

  -  More than 960 Russian troops were killed, among them an 
officer with the rank of brigadier general, named Alexeyev, and 
another with the rank of colonel, named Merkulov. We have 
videotapes of these operations, in which the two Russian 
officers were killed. 
  -  We destroyed large quantities of heavy weapons and captured 
many of them from the Russian forces fighting us. 
  -  We destroyed a number of Russian observation points along the 
Afghan-Tajik borders, making it easy for us to cross the borders 
safely. This reflects the extent of the Russian forces' retreat 
and their entrenchment in the cities after being repeatedly 
defeated. 

    [Yahya] And yet doesn't the Tajik Government's continued 
control of the situation thus far mean that its position is 
still strong? 
  [Usmon] That is an incorrect deduction, because we are not 
fighting Tajik armies. We are fighting more than 25,000 Russian 
troops and other forces from Uzbekistan. 
  Tajikistan, as you know, has no regular army, and prior to 
this there were only 5,000 Russian troops in the country. With 
the outbreak of fighting, the Russian Government summoned 
Division 201 to Dushanbe. These were the forces that had 
formerly been based in the countries of Eastern Europe. This 
means that the present government in Dushanbe is an agent 
government, whose ability to remain in power depends upon the 
Russian army in Tajikistan. In spite of all this, we have 
achieved major victories, as I mentioned, and Russian forces 
often surrender with their weapons to our forces. These forces 
have accumulated military experience from their participation in 
the Afghanistan war. We find no hardship in our struggle with 
the Russian forces, who, from their behavior, appear to be on 
the verge of nervous breakdowns. 
  [Yahya] You said that there are forces from Uzbekistan 
supporting the Tajik Government. What is the volume of these 
troops? How do you explain their participation? 
  [Usmon] Yes, there is a brigade from Uzbekistan based in the 
capital Dushanbe, and it was assigned the task of protecting the 
country's vital installations. Besides that, the Uzbekistan 
Government itself is firing missiles at our positions near the 
Uzbek borders. I believe that this position of Uzbekistan's is 
direct interference in our internal affairs, and not in 
Uzbekistan's interest. 
  Perhaps Uzbekistan's motive for this policy is its ruling 
regime's fear of the Islamic forces in Uzbekistan. It accuses us 
of funding these forces against the regime, which is not true. 
We have special circumstances, and neither at present nor in the 
future have we any ambition to interfere in the affairs of other 
countries. We want to establish good neighborly relations with 
our various neighbors, including Uzbekistan and Russia itself. 
  [Yahya] There are military reports that you have obtained 
U.S. Stinger missiles, which Afghan fighters used against the 
Russian army. What is your comment? 
  [Usmon] That is a slander we have already proved false. I do 
not know in whose interest it is to concoct these fantastic 
stories about us. We have heard of these missiles only in the 
media. If the Afghans had these missiles, it would not be easy 
to get them; and they are busy with their own internal affairs. 
It has never happened, that we have tried to obtain these 
missiles. 
  [Yahya] It was attributed to the Tajik military command, 
that 
you have Stinger missiles. 
  [Usmon] I told you it is not true, and Mohammadsharif 
Himmatzoda [name as transliterated], to whom it was attributed, 
has denied the truth of what was attributed to him. 
<H5>  Sources of Arms </H5>
  [Yahya] So where do you get your arms from? 
  [Usmon] You know that we spent six months in power before 
the 
communist forces conspired with the Russians and others against 
us. We were able to obtain some weapons. With the continued 
fighting against the materially collapsing Russian forces, we 
got many spoils. We do not need the Afghans or others to give us 
arms. We have enough. 
  [Yahya] You have said that you have returned from Tajikistan 
recently after spending about four months there. Do the arms you 
have and the standard of your fighters permit you to fight a 
regular war? Or will you resort to a war of nerves, as the 
Afghans fought before you? 
  [Usmon] We are fighting a regular war. As I have already 
said, we have tanks, armored vehicles, and missiles, and we have 
a large number of fighters. There are many fronts on which the 
Russian forces face our forces from a short distances--no more 
than one kilometer. But we are fighting a war of nerves in the 
east and south of the capital, Dushanbe. 
  [Yahya] It is known that there are democratic and socialist 
forces working with you to confront the Tajikistan Government. 
Is there a unified command to which the fighting forces are 
subject, or are there independent fronts? 
  [Usmon] I can tell you that there is a single command 
directing military action inside the country, and all fighting 
forces belonging to the various outfits in Tajikistan are 
subject to it. But what I would like to emphasize is that there 
are no democratic or socialist forces worth mentioning. The real 
power belongs to the Islamic front, and it is what as a rule 
leads military action in Tajikistan. 
  [Yahya] But don't you think--in light of the Afghan 
experience--that the disparity in ideological directions in your 
ranks might, in the long term, cause an internal split? 
  [Usmon] I don't think so. We are perfectly aware of the 
Afghan experience and what makes it unique. We are eager to 
learn from the mistakes that the Afghan leadership made there. 
That is why we formed a single command to direct military and 
political action, without partisanship or tribalism. There is 
unanimity among the present leadership in its various sides. 
<H5>  Thoughts of a Settlement </H5>
  [Yahya] Have you a specific idea of how a settlement to the 
current Tajik crisis might be reached? Have you held any talks 
with the Dushanbe Government? 
  [Usmon] We have never before held talks with the Russians or 
their Tajik allies, but the Russians want to talk. The secretary 
general of the United Nations recently sent a letter to the 
Dushanbe Government asking them to hold talks with us. Many 
Western countries have shown great interest in working to remedy 
the situation in Tajikistan before it gets serious. They think 
we intend to export our thinking to the other Muslim republics 
in Central Asia. 
  We are ready to enter into negotiations with the Russians, 
but we have refused to join a coalition with the communists, 
because they have no influence with the people. 
  [Yahya] But what is your view of the possibility of a 
peaceful settlement to the current crisis? 
  [Usmon] We were compelled to fight; we did not start it. It 
was the communist elements who took up arms against us, and for 
us there was no alternative to self defense. We spent six months 
in power with the democrats, but the communists hindered all the 
efforts for reform and construction that we had begun. They 
tried to paralyze our government's activity by coordinating with 
the Russians, Uzbeks, and others. 
  They kept on attacking the leaders of the Islamic and 
democratic movement. They never ceased until they forced us to 
leave power, seeking help in doing so from the Russian Army. Our 
only option was to take up arms in self-defense. We want peace 
and stability to return to our country, and for the more than 
100,000 Tajik emigres outside the country to return. There are 
many friendly parties urging us to pursue the road to a 
settlement. 
  [Yahya] You attended the Sudan meeting organized by Dr. 
Hasan 
al-Turabi. Did you get any promises that Sudan would provide 
material or military aid? 
  [Usmon] I attended that conference because al-Turabi invited 
me. My part in it was like that of many others of various 
[political] directions. My going to Sudan does not mean I 
support Sudanese policies, nor does it mean I reject them. As to 
what Sudan has to offer us, as you know, Sudan is a poor 
country, and can barely take care of itself, so how can it 
support others? 
  [Yahya] What is your position on Iran? Have you received 
military assistance from Iran? 
  [Usmon] Iran was the first country after America to 
acknowledge our independence. It offered much aid to Tajikistan 
while we were in power, and opened cultural centers in the 
country, based on the ethnic and linguistic relations that bind 
us. We both speak Persian, unlike the other Muslim republics in 
Central Asia. Despite that, we welcome any aid from any country. 
Iran's aid to us does not mean that we agree with its policies. 
  [Yahya] There is a Tajik majority in the northern region of 
Afghanistan, which emigrated there at the time of the communist 
revolution in 1917. Does this ethnic connection have an effect 
on your struggle with the Dushanbe Government? 
  [Usmon] No one is denying that we receive great material 
support from our Tajik brothers in northern Afghanistan. At the 
official level, the Afghan Government is unable to offer us any 
aid; we understand the conditions they are going through because 
of the fighting Kabul is experiencing now and then.

<F P=106> ["Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of </F>
Uzbekistan: On the Introduction Into Circulation in the Republic 
of Uzbekistan of the `Sum-Coupon' as a Parallel Means of 
Payment"] 
  [Text] With the aim of ensuring timely payment of wages, 
pensions, stipends, allowances, and other varieties of monetary 
income to the populace and of protecting the domestic consumer 
market of the Republic, as well as in conformance with Decrees 
of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 
883-KhP, dated 7 May 1993, and No. 952-KhP, dated 3 September 
1993, the Cabinet of Ministers decrees: 
  1. To introduce into circulation in the Republic of 
Uzbekistan as of 15 November 1993 the "sum-coupon" as a means of 
payment parallel to the 1961-1992 issue ruble [R]. 
  To establish that the "sum-coupon" will be put into 
circulation with face values of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 
500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 "sums," in the ratio of one 
"sum-coupon" to one 1961-1992 issue ruble and, correspondingly, 
to Bank of Russia 1993-issue banknotes. 
  The Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan will ensure, 
beginning 15 November 1993, the distribution of "sum-coupons" 
simultaneously with rubles and within the time frames for 
payment of wages, pensions, stipends, allowances, and other 
payments, in the established proportions. The distribution of 
subsequent regular payments will be ensured prior to 21 November 
1993. Pensions and stipends for December 1993 will be paid in 
"sum-coupons" in the amount of 100 percent. 
  "Sum-coupons" will be accepted in the Republic of Uzbekistan 
on a mandatory basis by state, cooperative, and other types of 
enterprises, institutions, and organizations, and by the 
populace for all varieties of payment, as well as by bank 
institutions and enterprises of the Ministry of Communications 
for crediting to current settlement accounts, deposits, letters 
of credit, and transfers, without any restrictions. 
  Accounting records in the national economy and noncash 
settlements between juridical persons of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan will be maintained in rubles in accordance with 
established procedure. 
  2. To repeal the validity of coupon cards (single-use 
coupons) in the Republic of Uzbekistan as of 22 November 1993. 
  3. To stipulate the following with respect to banknotes of 
the USSR State Bank and Bank of Russia: 
  a) Bank of Russia 1993-issue banknotes will be accepted as 
means of payment in the Republic of Uzbekistan without any 
restriction; 
  b) USSR State Bank 1961-1992 issue banknotes in 
denominations 
of R1, R3, R5, R10, R25, R50, and R100 along with "sum-coupons" 
may be used as means of payment without any restriction; 
  c) 1961-1992 issue banknotes of the USSR State Bank and Bank 
of Russia in denominations of R200, R500, and R1,000 will be 
accepted as means of payment until a certain date, at which time 
they will be exchanged for "sum-coupons" of the Central Bank of 
Uzbekistan; 
  d) beginning 15 November 1993, the use of banknotes of the 
Bank of Russia in R5,000 and R10,000 denominations is prohibited 
for any kind of payment. As of 1 December 1993, the Central Bank 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan will terminate completely the 
issue of these banknotes into circulation. It is recommended 
that banknotes of these denominations in the possession of the 
population be used to effect deposits to savings bank 
institutions, with subsequent use in accordance with established 
procedure. 
  4. To approve the listing of consumer goods to be sold to 
the 
populace for "sum-coupons" only, in accordance with Appendix No. 
1. All remaining product varieties costing up to R25,000 and all 
paid services (municipal, domestic, transportation, etc.) may be 
sold in exchange for rubles (except in denominations of R5,000 
and R10,000). This procedure will be introduced beginning 22 
November 1993. 
  5. To retain the previously established procedure according 
to which all products costing more than R25,000 are sold through 
the trade network using settlement checks, checkbooks, or 
transfer upon depositor instructions, issued in the Republic of 
Uzbekistan only to its citizens and only upon presentation of a 
passport containing an annotation in the passport insert. 
  6. To acknowledge that the Savings Bank, Ministry of 
Finance, 
and State Committee for the Press approve the form of passport 
insert and regulations pertaining to it, and deliver these to 
institutions of the Savings Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan. 
  7. Beginning 15 November 1993, it is prohibited to bring 
1961-1992 issue ruble cash into the Republic of Uzbekistan. 
  8. To establish the norms for physical and juridical persons 
with respect to taking 1993-issue Bank of Russia banknotes 
outside the Republic in the amount of R150,000. 1993-issue Bank 
of Russia banknotes in excess of the established amount may be 
taken out by special authorization of the Central Bank of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan. 
  9. That the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan will 
open special centers for exchanging "sum-coupons" for 1993-issue 
Russian rubles in the proportion 1:1 and in exchange for freely 
convertible currency at the established rate. 
  10. That the State Committee for Prognoses and Statistics of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan will introduce monthly statistical

<F P=106> [Lieutenant Colonel Kirill Petrov "Military Review": "At a </F>
Turning Point. The Conflict in Karabakh Could Escalate into a 
Large-Scale Regional War"] 
  [Text] The December-January offensive by Azerbaijani 
troops is a logical continuation of the events of last summer, 
as a result of which defense detachments of the NKR 
[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] (according to Baku's version, an 
Armenian expeditionary corps) took several strategically 
important Azerbaijani population centers outside 
Nagorno-Karabakh (Agdam, Fizuli, Kubatly), while in Baku the 
political crisis had reached its peak and subsequently resolved 
itself in another change of leader in the republic. Back then, 
even before he had "legalized" his ascent of the Mount Olympus 
of state power by means of a general election, Geydar Aliyev had 
promised to resolve the Karabakh problem. 
  At that time NKR defense detachments had occupied 724 
Azerbaijani population centers, and only 215 of them were on 
Karabakh territory. Approximately 1 million refugees were 
homeless.... 
  The "summer campaign" of 1993 in Karabakh ended in total 
triumph for some and a nightmare rout for others. Never before 
in five years of war had NKR defense detachments "sunk their 
teeth" so deep into Azerbaijan: Occupying 25 percent of its 
territory, they set up several so-called "security zones" around 
the NKR and took control of a 170-km section of the 
Azerbaijani-Iranian border. 
  Never before had the Azerbaijani Army suffered such a 
crushing defeat as in last year's "summer campaign." Agdam, 
Fizuli, and Kubatly surrendered virtually without a fight -- 
cities for which, proceeding from strategic considerations, the 
army should have fought to the last bullet, but it withdrew 
essentially without firing a single shot, having evacuated the 
population in advance. 
  This circumstance gave certain observers grounds for calling 
the war in Karabakh "strange" and assuming, not without reason, 
in my view, that at the height of the power crisis the military 
thus assisted "the departure of Abulfaz Elchibey," then the 
Azerbaijani president. If this is really so and if precisely 
this was the strategic task of the Azerbaijani Army, then it 
should be recognized that it coped with it brilliantly. In any 
event Elchibey "departed" (true, this also required a thrust 
from Ganja to Baku by detachments of the rebel Colonel Surret 
Guseynov, who in the recent past, incidentally, was commander of 
an Azerbaijani corps in Northern Karabakh), Geydar Aliyev became 
president, and the army itself, despite claims to the contrary, 
has not only preserved but also augmented its potential during 
the four months of the truce. There remained, and remains, just 
one thing for Geydar Aliyev to do -- to carry out his election 
promise.... 
  If anyone had any hope that the third president of 
Azerbaijan 
would reject a strong-arm solution to the problem, it was 
dispelled in December, with the first shots on the Karabakh 
front. There is, of course, an explanation for this. It is 
difficult to hope for success in talks with an opponent who has 
occupied one-fourth of the country's territory and utterly 
ruined approximately 1 million of your fellow citizens. Yes, 
Aliyev, like his predecessors, has gambled on force, but it is 
appropriate to point out that neither Mutalibov nor Elchibey 
found themselves in such difficult conditions as he does. 
  So the guns started up in Karabakh once again in December. 
Never before had the front line of the Azerbaijani Army's 
offensive been so broad: from the north to the south of the 
republic. The fighting was fierce, and there were big losses on 
both sides. At the time these lines are being written, the 
Azeris have taken the border settlement of Goradiz near Iran and 
won back 40 of the 170 km of the border with that state 
controlled by Karabakhis. According to information from some 
sources, Azerbaijani detachments are advancing toward the 
enemy's rear from Iranian territory. 
  The attackers' strategic plan has become apparent during the 
recent days of fighting in the zone of conflict: with 
simultaneous strikes in the north of the NKR's Mardakertskiy 
Rayon and in the east -- against the cities of Askeran, Agdam, 
and Fizuli -- to develop an offensive against Kelbadzhar and 
Kubatly and cut the Lachin corridor. 
  In turn it has to be thought that the Karabakh defense 
detachments will not give up the "security zone" around the NKR 
just like that. A great deal in the winter campaign will, in my 
view, depend on whether the Azerbaijani Army has been able to 
reinstate itself sufficiently to endure a large-scale offensive 
over the entire front. Will it not be become a spent force when 
drawn into static fighting (the Karabakhis are hurriedly 
creating a second defense echelon in certain sections of the 
confrontation)? 
  However.... The conflict in Karabakh has approached the 
stage where it is no longer so important who will emerge the 
winner from the "winter campaign": There is no military 
solution to the Karabakh problem, and the mechanism of a 
peaceful settlement has not been worked out. The most the 
opponents are capable of, even then not without the assistance 
of intermediaries, is reaching agreement on a truce, which is 
used, as a rule, under cover of diplomatic maneuvers and 
blocking of the peace initiatives of those same intermediaries, 
to restore combat potential and prepare for a counterstrike. 
  But the more profound the Karabakh impasse, the more likely 
the threat of the conflict's internationalization. 
Incidentally, Afghan mojahedin, citizens of Turkey, Syria, and 
Lebanon, and "volunteers" from CIS countries are already 
fighting here. But something else is far more alarming. While 
war was being waged at a respectable distance from their 
borders, Tehran and Ankara admitted purely hypothetically the 
possibility of their direct participation in the conflict. But 
attitudes toward it have been under revision for some time. 
  When as many as several tens of thousands of refugees 
gathered on adjacent territory last summer, Iran held the 
largest combined-arms exercises involving aircraft on the border 
for 15 years. 
  According to data from various sources, during those 
exercises Iranian Army subunits crossed the border and guarded a 
reservoir near the village of Goradiz. Several more subunits 
were ready to cross the border. After this -- how tightly 
everything here is intertwined -- Ankara voiced alarm "in 
connection with the concentration of Iranian subunits near the 
Azerbaijani border," and on 6 September the head of a Turkish 
parliamentary delegation spoke in Baku of "his government's 
readiness to give Azerbaijan military aid in the event of a 
further escalation of hostilities by Armenia." Turkey's resolve 
was confirmed in Moscow last fall by Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller, and former Premier Bulent Ecevit has called for air 
strikes against the Armenians. 
  It would not be out of place to remind you that, in the 
opinion of experts, the Turkish Army is the strongest in the 
region. Approximately 1,000 tanks, 1,100 armored vehicles, 2,500 
artillery pieces and mortars, 150 combat helicopters, and 300 
aircraft of the 2d Tactical Command are concentrated on 
territory bordering on Armenia. The "North" group of Iranian 
troops constitutes roughly the same striking force on the border 
with Azerbaijan. 
  Whereas just a few months ago movements of Iranian and 
Turkish units and subunits on the borders could be regarded as a 
final warning, today....

<F P=106> [Article by Eldar Zeynalov: "The Partisans Are Coming Down </F>
From the Hills: Azerbaijan En Route to a Regular Army"] 
  [Text] An obligatory attribute of any state laying 
claim to independence, especially one with hostile neighbors, is 
a regular army. It has to be acknowledged that Azerbaijan lacks 
this attribute as yet. Its armed forces are helpless before the 
sallies of the Karabakh separatists and their allies, who have 
occupied a good one-fourth of the territory of the republic. And 
all this despite the fact that the area is not short of 
resources and that Azerbaijan obtained an entirely sufficient 
inheritance from the former Soviet Army. 
  What, then, is the problem? The fact that unlearned lessons 
of history condemn a society to repeat them. Did not the history 
of the Bolsheviks show that neither internal sedition nor 
outside intervention can be overcome with a volunteer, 
semi-partisan army? Did not the military campaign of 1941 show 
that only iron discipline turns a mob into an army? Should the 
future of the state have been endangered for truisms to be put 
to the test all over again? But the Azerbaijan Popular Front, 
whose position has in recent years largely determined the 
political climate in the republic, regarded the army primarily 
as an instrument of the winning of political power and made 
efforts to get hold of weapons. 
  The first appeal for the formation of volunteer squads was 
heard in Baku at a demonstration in Baku on 13 January 1990, 
when, in the period of heavy fighting in Khanlarskiy Rayon, the 
Azerbaijan Popular Front formed the National Defense Committee 
headed by Elchibey. I recall how in the academy institute where 
I was working at that time the registration of volunteers, which 
was earnestly supported by the Communist Party organization and 
even the chief of the Special Department (a KGB man, that is), 
began. This immediately put me on my guard, especially since no 
one was given weapons, and the lists of the most active and 
resolute members of the opposition who had registered were not 
kept secret. The underlying motives for the provocation became 
clear when, a week later, Soviet forces entered the city under 
the cover of a furor concerning "thousands of Popular Front 
combatants." 
  The volunteer movement subsequently once again made its 
presence known following Azerbaijan's proclamation of 
independence in the fall of 1991. Under the conditions of the 
disintegration of the USSR and the Soviet Army and the 
Azerbaijan Popular Front's uncompromising campaign to oust the 
Communists it was a matter of fundamental importance into whose 
hands the weapons being sold off by the "father-commanders" of 
the 4th Army would fall. President Ayaz Mutalibov, who 
recognized this danger, adopted an edict on the depoliticization 
of the power structures even before the official commencement of 
the formation of an army and prior to the self-dissolution of 
the local Communist Party. 
  Both then and, at times, now also Mutalibov is reproached 
with being reluctant to form a national army. I believe, 
however, that he did want to, but by no means just any army. 
Thus the "Fronter" Fakhmin Gadzhiyev, whom he had appointed 
deputy minister of defense, pulled back one unit from its 
positions in Karabakh in January 1992 and brought it to 
Baku--"the boys need to wash, they say." And in March the 
"Fronter" Ragim Gaziyev, commandant of Shusha, whom the 
opposition had strenuously pushed as defense minister, 
threatened from the parliamentary rostrum, with a portable radio 
in his hand, that he would bring his fighters from Shusha and 
arrange a repetition of the Tbilisi events in Baku. The defense 
measures of the "red" government, weakened by the loss of the 
"flower" of the presidential team in the helicopter shot down 
over Karabakh in November 1991, were censured in the opposition 
press. The exploits of the leaders of the volunteer campaign, 
among whom the above-mentioned Ragim Gaziyev (a mathematician by 
education) had progressed particularly, were simultaneously 
being lauded to the skies. After all this, is it any wonder that 
the army of sovereign Azerbaijan officially numbered by the 
spring of 1992 some 150 fighters--half as many as the members of 
parliament? The rest of the fighting force consisted of 
volunteers--members of the Azerbaijan Popular Front or those in 
sympathy with this organization. 
  The surrender to the Armenians, scandalous and bordering on 
treachery and still not thoroughly investigated, of the cities 
of Khodzhaly--in February 1992 (under Tair Aliyev)--and Shusha 
and Lachin--in May 1992 (under Ragim Gaziyev)--occurred at the 
time of Azerbaijan Popular Front member defense ministers. 
  Attempting to find the "culprit," the guilty party, the 
Azerbaijan Popular Front regime took punitive action against 
many of yesterday's "heroes" of the volunteer campaign (Gatyr 
Mamed in Agdam, Mekhraliyev in Agdash, Bakhramov in Dzhalilabad, 
Alyamshakh in Badra, S. Guseynov in Ganja, and others), 
simultaneously attempting to do some things in respect to the 
formation of a regular army. Thus illegal armed formations were 
banned, and a draft spanning 10 successive draft-year age groups 
was announced also (reduced to nothing by the corruption of the 
military registration and recruitment offices). 
  But time had already been lost, and the growing opposition 
was scoring points with each new defeat at the front. What was 
most dangerous was that the army also, in which by the end of 
their rule the "Fronters" had repressed six out of 10 generals 
and one-eighth of the officer corps, had slipped out of control. 
And the Azerbaijan Popular Front then turned once again to the 
tried-and-tested weapon--volunteer squads, whose formation was 
announced, with the tacit approval of President Elchibey (and in 
violation of his edict) at a meeting of the Azerbaijan Popular 
Front in February 1993 in Baku. A state of emergency was imposed 
in April, and it was announced that the Azerbaijan Popular Front 
was "prepared not to shrink from bloodshed." This was 
demonstrated at the time of the events of June 1993 in Ganja, 
which culminated, however, unexpectedly for the organizers in 
the victory of a leader of the volunteer campaign who had 
suffered repression--Suret Guseynov. The circle was thus closed, 
and the regime fell apart in a clash with its own creation. 
  The struggle against the volunteer anarchist chaos was a 
principal direction of the activity of Geydar Aliyev, who came 
to power. The unprofessional proteges of the Popular Front were 
methodically "smoked out" of their positions in the power 
ministries, approximately 30 battalions, composed of 50 percent 
"dead souls" and 50 percent former volunteers, were disbanded, 
and Ragim Gaziyev and a number of other Azerbaijan Popular Front 
figures, against whom charges of the negligent discharge of 
their official duties in the army, theft of property, and such 
were brought, were arrested. The press was given the "go-ahead" 
for descriptions of the gangster adventures of a number of 
"chieftains," which had earlier been shamefully hushed up from 
patriotic considerations. 
  At the present time the volunteer squads persist only in the 
Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, where several areas remain 
under the control of the Azerbaijan Popular Front. They are 
headed here by one T. Guseynov, who proposed in August the 
formation of a Nakhichevan Defense Council to confront possible 
Armenian aggression against this Azerbaijani autonomy. 
  The ring around the fugitive ex-President Elchibey is 
tightening. The detachment of interior forces loyal to him has 
been disarmed, and 12 officers and the chief himself (lacking, 
according to the tradition of recent times, special education) 
have been dismissed from the district police department in his 
native Ordubadskiy Rayon. An attempt to seize the Nakhichevan 
Autonomous Republic MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] on 29 
October was foiled and led to the arrest of the most active 
"Fronters." Elchibey's cousin--Aydyn Gasymov, against whom a 
Turkish fanatic, a "gray wolf," arrested on 1 October 
testified--was arrested and charged with preparing an act of 
terrorism. 
  G. Aliyev has left his predecessor two ways out--to fully 
disarm (physically and ideologically) and submit to him as 
president or, relying on the volunteer-combatants, to continue 
the desperate, but doomed struggle to the end. In the first case 
Elchibey would be left without even the illusory hope of once 
again seating himself in the presidential chair. In the second 
there is a chance that he could escape to friends in Turkey 
wearing a martyr's crown and even form a "government in exile" 
from the cis-devant of his circle. 
  Whatever the case, it is obvious that Azerbaijan has gotten 
over the volunteer campaign. Individual squads or terrorists are 
no longer calling the tune in policy, and the formation of a 
regular army has been the priority concern of domestic policy 
and serves as the basis of the mutual understanding in the 
President Aliyev-Prime Minister Guseynov tandem. Following the 
punishment of several military commissars, mobilization is 
finally under way. Deserters are being caught, and military 
tribunals, who have in the year examined hundreds of cases, are 
operating. The day when quantity switches to quality is not far 
off. Especially since following the failure of the efforts of 
the CSCE and the four UN Security Council resolutions on the 
liberation of the occupied territories, which have been ignored 
by the Armenians, the Azerbaijani leadership is left with no 
choice, evidently.

<F P=106> [Report by Sokhbet Mamedov: "Azerbaijan's Foreign Trade Is </F>
Taken Under State Control"] 
  [Text] Baku--The president of Azerbaijan has issued an 
edict on tightening control over the foreign trade activity of 
the republic's enterprises and organizations. This is a forced 
measure, a number of economists believe, and has been brought 
about by the fact that more than 90 percent of the republic's 
enterprises engaged in foreign trade transactions are 
endeavoring to keep the monetary resources they have earned 
outside of Azerbaijan. Last year Azerbaijan exported $750 
million of commodities overseas. Of this sum, more than $600 
million have not as yet entered the republic. 
  A similar trend is being observed in commercial transactions 
with the republics of the "near abroad," Russia included. For 
example, according to figures of the State Committee for 
Statistics, in nine months of the current year R116 billion of 
commodities were exported to Russia and just R62 billion of 
goods were imported. The arrears of more distant foreign 
countries are substantial. Such states as Iran, Turkey, and 
Greece owe Azerbaijan over $60 billion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bank Policy Must Be Restructured"] </F>
  [Text] There is a serious need for the complete 
restructuring of economics and bank policy in the republic. This 
was discussed broadly at a meeting held at the Cabinet of 
Ministers which was chaired by Azerbaijan's prime minister, 
Surat Huseynov, on 5 October. 
  At this meeting, which was attended by leading workers in 
the 
republic's banking, financial and tax organizations, the 
situation in the finance and credit system was analyzed from all 
sides. The discussion about the budget shortfall, shortcomings 
in the collection of taxes and the low level of banking 
technology was broached uncomfortably. It was noted that a 
number of institutions openly avoid paying taxes, checks are not 
accepted by the cashiers at commercial stores, and there is no 
supervision over fully transferring to the budget taxes on 
income attained. 
  In the opinion of those who spoke at the meeting, there is 
an 
urgent need for changes in the tax law, in preparing tax 
prognoses, and in defining types of additional taxes. The 
situation in the economy requires that domestic debit and credit 
obligations be met rapidly. There can be no satisfaction in the 
fact that these debts amount to some 200 billion rubles. 
  The speakers also touched on the issue of taking relevant 
measures to use the state's expenditures more effectively. It 
was noted that the most important production sectors have to be 
restructured and that investment financing means must be used 
correctly. The strengthening of the state's control over 
currency transactions was made a priority at the meeting. It was 
noted that import-export activity by banks was not supervised 
adequately and that the employment of personnel with no 
experience in the banking system had led to a lagging behind in 
many sectors. 
  Prime Minister Surat Huseynov, in summing up the meeting's 
results, talked about concrete duties connected with the 
subjects discussed.

<F P=106> [Article by Eybaly Mehreliyev, Dr. Geo. Sci.: "There Is But </F>
One Citizen In A Civilized Country"] 
  [Text] The geographical location of the Azerbaijan 
Republic, which is located in what Academician Marr called the 
"Caucasian Isthmus," lies at the crossroads of Christianity and 
Islam, Christian-Gregorianism and Judaism. This occurred without 
discrimination among the peoples. In the course of historical 
processes the republic's population mixed and intermingled with 
other peoples and ethnic groups in addition to those who were 
Turkic-speaking. 
  The fact that the majority of the people living in the 
republic are Muslim has led to broad relationships. This assures 
the close unity of the population. But processes following the 
fall of the Soviet empire caused a far-reaching national 
awakening in Azerbaijan, as well as in other places. The 
situation which was created led to the development of thoughts 
about entire nations, as well as minority peoples in determining 
their own fate. 
  As a result of poorly thought out propaganda about ethnic 
relations, a number of minorities have begun to establish their 
own self "defense." Thus, they have created their own 
"societies."In the past, this commanded great sympathy. However, 
this also awakened the self-preservation instinct of peoples, 
and created Talysh, Lezgian, Avar, Udin and Kurdish factors. 
Undoubtedly, had attention in government circles not been drawn 
to this, the mature social stratum of national minorities could 
have slowed this process down and preserved it. 
  It strikes many that the process of national awakening is 
accidental and could be quickly eliminated. Such ideas are 
mistaken, the disturbance created from national awakening will 
survive a long time. Among the population of those who have not 
yet become adults this process will continue even longer. This 
process also creates social tension. Earlier, 35-40 thousand 
youth having very strong self-preservation instincts left the 
republic every year. This significantly weakened the social 
tension. On one hand, the war, the lack of growth of jobs and 
the horrendous refugee situation, on the other, the 
non-objective propaganda by provocateurs, makes the situation 
more complicated. There is, however, no national basis for this. 
The present social and economic difficulties have created the 
war. We have to emerge from this situation by working together 
and striking back at the enemy. 
  In the time of the last regime a number of mistakes were 
also 
made in ethnic policy. By saying "Turks have no friends other 
than Turks," the potential for ethnic discrimination was 
created. The population living in the republic, regardless of 
their size or number, took part jointly in the formation and 
development of national culture in Azerbaijan. These peoples 
were stabilized by one citizenship in our republic. Thus, there 
was never national discrimination in Azerbaijan. But, within the 
ongoing processes, the spirit of self-awareness began to grow. 
Provocateurs, making use of this, are beginning to increase 
dissatisfaction among the non-Turkic population. 
  The emergence of the wish to "live freely" in man's nature 
creates the conditions for fragmentation. Narrow-minded men 
understand the concept of "living freely" only in a limited 
sense, and interpret it as the living freely of individual men. 
Nevertheless, the wish to live "freely" must be understood to 
mean the development of an ethnic group or people, its reaching 
world culture, and its national flowering. 
  In recent years, the inflaming of ethnic feelings in the 
republic has done serious damage to mutual understanding. But 
social development led to the attainment of a civilized level 
within the population and the dominance of individuals with 
harmonious natures within the ethnos. Without them, no ethnos 
could survive, and each of these persons is a reason for the 
development of the ethnos. Because such people are at a mature 
stage, they equate their passionate impulse with their instinct 
for self-preservation. When the individual's self-preservation 
reaches a harmful level, it leads to the growth of people to a 
mentality of prodigality and an anti-social character. Mature 
individuals know that peoples possessing a small population and 
little territory can always gain an entree to world culture 
through the language and cultural treasury of any large nation 
because their intellectual development and local possibilities 
do not correspond to a modern level of development. Thus, 
socially mature persons from minority peoples have always worked 
to create close ties with the larger people. When the Azerbaijan 
Democratic Republic [ADP] was established the Avars living in 
Balaken and Zagatala Rayons wanted the opening of schools in 
their own language. Knowing this, Colonel Ahmedbey Dibirov 
(commander of the ADP army in the Sheki-Zagatala zone) advised 
them that if we want to reach out to world culture, we have to 
study in Turkish or Russian. Since our people are similar to the 
Turks as Muslims, it would be more appropriate for the children 
to study in Turkish. 
  In every country the permanent residents of that country are 
citizens of it. Often those who talk about civilization have to 
be aware that in the United States of America, the world's most 
progressive, civilized and democratic country, there are only 
citizens, not nationalities. 
  Second, the thrusting forward of national discrimination is 
ignorance. Such imprudence has done not less damage to the 
republic than the war. 
  Ethnic relations in the Azerbaijan Republic are seen broadly 
in the context of living together, unity of religion and family 
relationships. The national question is an exceptionally broad 
and sophisticated problem. Without knowing its scope, certain 
peoples conducting a nationality policy who lack an instinct for 
self-preservation have not drawn necessary conclusions. Dividing 
a people according to the concept of large or small is in itself 
defective. In every measure conducted in this sector, the entire 
population must be evaluated as a whole because the destiny of 
the republic is in their hands. In other words, the demands on 
the one citizen and this same citizen's concerns must be 
identical.

<F P=106> [Interview with Atakhan Musayev, head of the Main Archive </F>
Administration of the Azerbaijan Republic Cabinet of Ministers, 
by Aghagulu Niftaliyev: "Without Archives, There Is No History"] 
  [Text] Our interviewee is Atakhan Musayev, candidate in 
historical sciences and head of the Main Archive Administration 
of the Azerbaijan Republic Cabinet of Ministers. 
  [Niftaliyev] The importance of archives in the study of the 
history of our republic and people is irreplaceable. How is the 
Main Archive Administration meeting this commitment now? 
  [Musayev] History must be learned and studied. The great 
majority of documents and materials to write history based on 
the facts are kept in the archives. The archives are an 
autobiography, a diary, a book of memories about every country, 
society and their lives. For me, the archive is a living 
organism, an existence. 
  These documents are concentrated in the state archives of 
our 
republic. The leadership of the archives, supervision of its 
work and related matters is the direct job of the Main Archive 
Administration of the Azerbaijan Republic Cabinet of Ministers. 
This organization also supervises work conducted on documents 
concerned with the republic's work and administrative archives, 
and provides them with methodological help. 
  [Niftaliyev] How is archive work structured in our republic? 
  [Musayev] There is a vast archive network in our republic. 
There are now seven state archives in our republic. These are 
the Azerbaijan Republic Historical Archive, the Contemporary 
History Archive, the Archives of Political Parties and Public 
Movements, the Literature and Fine Arts Archive, the Scientific 
Technical and Medical Documents Archive, the Cinema-Photo 
Archive, and the Oral Archive. Branches of the Contemporary 
History Archive are located in 15 cities of the republic. There 
are also rayon state archives. In Nakhichevan, the autonomous 
republic has a Central State Archive. In short, an archival 
network which has collected together in itself abundant 
documents and materials that make the history of our people come 
alive in our republic. There are more than 3.5 million separate 
documents in these archives. In the documents the rich history 
of our people from the end of the eighteenth century to the 
present are preserved. The scope of the work and the documents 
in the archives continues to expand. 
  [Niftaliyev] What changes have there been in recent years, 
and have there been any new archives created? 
  [Musayev] In connection with the dissolution of the 
Azerbaijan Communist Party and the abolition of the Party 
History Institute of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan CP 
at the end of 1991, the party archives were subordinated to the 
Main Archive Administration in accordance with the order of the 
president of the Azerbaijan Republic dated 24 October 1991. 
Through our efforts the Republic Cabinet of Ministers created 
the Central State Archive of Parties and Public Movements on 18 
December 1991. The major duty placed before this archive was not 
only to preserve the documents of the Communist Party and 
organize their use, but also to provide 
scientific-methodological advice and help for the numerous 
parties nd public movements to establish their own archives and 
to preserve their documents. 
  [Niftaliyev] How are the Archive documents used? 
  [Musayev] The archive documents are used for various 
purposes: in research work and practical work including the 
education of the younger generation by means of radio, 
television and the periodical press. The work of using the 
archive documents is basically conducted in two directions. The 
first of them is that the documents of the state archives 
themselves are placed at the disposal of the broad reading 
masses through the periodical press, document collections and 
other means. Our archives have disseminated dozens of 
large-scale document collections, and thousands of documents 
have appeared in the pages of the journal AZERBAYJAN ARKHIVI. 
Our colleagues are preparing a number of document collections 
and publications of "white stains" in our history, and over the 
period of 1918-1920 and later. In this series are "Protocols of 
Meetings of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic," "Decrees of the Government of the Azerbaijan 
Democratic Republic," "Work in the Sector of Building the Armed 
Forces of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic," and others. While 
some of these have been prepared and submitted to the publisher, 
unfortunately the expense and the limitations of financial 
possibilities have made it impossible to publish them. As for 
the journal AZERBAYJAN ARKHIVI, which is the best channel for 
bringing the documents to the readers, we have been unable to 
publish it for several years. 
  [Niftaliyev] Are there still documents marked secret? 
  [Musayev] The democratic changes occurring in our society 
have also had an influence on archive work and have led to the 
erasure of the secret stamp on many documents. For example, 
documents pertaining to the activities of the Azerbaijan 
Democratic Republic had been locked away for many years. In the 
last three or four years the most often-used documents are those 
pertaining to the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. 
  As for those documents still marked secret, these have 
always 
been in the archive and always will be. Documents pertaining to 
defense and state secrets are in this category. On the other 
hand, the protection of human rights and the inviolability of 
the person of a citizen of Azerbaijan under conditions of the 
democratization of society are being guaranteed, and the 
personal life, correspondence and other secrets of citizens of 
Azerbaijan are protected by law. In this context, the secrecy 
stamp is maintained. 
  [Niftaliyev] What are the difficulties in your work? 
  [Musayev] We have many difficulties. Without eliminating 
them 
it will be impossible to put our archive work on the level of 
modern demands. The most important is the lack of a building 
that corresponds to modern demands for the preservation of 
documents. Twenty years ago the foundation was laid for the 
construction of warehouses for the republic state archives. One 
could say that completion of the construction of this building 
could guarantee us with storage facilities for preserving all 
the state archives in the capital of our republic. This 
building, which could hold 1.5 million files, would have made it 
possible for the Central State Archives in Baku to accept more 
than one millon more files from various ministries, 
administrations and organizations. However, over the last 20-25 
years the archives have been unable to accept documents because 
of lack of space. Most of the documents are in antiquated, 
inadequate buildings. We were unable to create optimal 
circumstances for their preservation. This is causing the 
gradual loss and destruction of these documents. 
  One of our fundamental difficulties is the lack of 
laboratories equipped with the modern technology for the 
restoration and microfilming of documents. 
  [Niftaliyev] What are your relations with foreign archives? 
  [Musayev] Today the possibility has been established for the 
republic Main Archive Administration to freely enter the 
International Archive Council and establish bilateral relations 
with the archival organs of several countries. However, our 
financial situation makes it impossible to enter the 
International Archive Council. We are now working to achieve 
bilateral relations in this sector with the archives of certain 
countries. The first ties we have established were with the 
archives of the Republic of Turkey. In recent arrangements with 
Turkey we have received document collections pertaining to the 
history and bibliography of the Turkic world, as well as many 
other materials on archival work in the country. The most 
valuable for us under this arrangement is the receipt of the 
first volume of archival documents pertaining to relations 
between the Ottoman state and the Turkic khanates of Azerbaijan 
between 1578 and 1914. 
  [Niftaliyev] What measures are planned to improve archive 
work? 
  [Musayev] Primarily, the regulations of the Main Archive 
Administration must be changed. We have already prepared new 
regulations and submitted them to the Cabinet of Ministers. The 
difference between these regulations and the first is that the 
Main Archive Administration becomes completely independent. 
  We have also completed the draft of the law "On the Archive 
Fund and Archives in the Azerbaijan Republic." This will be the 
first legal document in our republic in the sector of archive 
work.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Azerbaijan-Dagestan Border Will Be </F>
Turned into a Stability Zone"] 
  [Text] The border of the Dagestan Republic of the Russian 
Federation and Azerbaijan must be turned into a zone of 
stability, security and cooperation. This wish of both sides was 
expressed by Azerbaijan's president, Heydar Aliyev, at a meeting 
held with elders from the neighboring Dagestan Republic who were 
in Azerbaijan on a trip. 
  The head of Azerbaijan's state, expressing our republic's 
position to the Dagestani guests, said that the border between 
us has a conditional character. For centuries representatives of 
the Azeris, Avars, Sakhurs, Kumyks, Dargins and other ethnic 
groups have lived in solidarity and mingled. Azerbaijan's 
president, while noting that the uniting of national minorities 
in various societies, including ethnic organizations, was 
worthy, also noted that common human values must unite all men, 
no matter what their identity. They have opted to live in our 
republic, and each of them are Azerbaijanians. As the rights and 
responsibilities of all of us are one, we must also correctly 
understand our duties. 
  Seid Gurbanov, head of the executive government of Derbend 
Rayon and spokesman for Dagestan's elders, in discussing the 
goal of the talks, said that they were of a mind to confirm the 
good ties between the states and make some proposals about 
aiding the refugees, which are a common problem. 
  Abbas Abbasov, republic deputy prime minister, took part in 
the reception.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ye.T. Gaydar, first deputy prime minister of </F>
the Russian Federation, by M. Panova; place and date not given: 
"The Logic of Reform"] 
  [Text] The government of Russia has been accused of 
neglecting "explanatory efforts" for a reason. Even professional 
economists do not always understand the logic of steps taken by 
the government; many actions cause bewilderment and, as a 
consequence, protest. In an effort to assist the readers of 
EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN in figuring out what the government itself 
means by the policy of reform, the editorial office approached 
Ye.T. Gaydar with a request to answer a number of questions 
which are encountered most frequently in letters from our 
readers. Therefore, Yegor Gaydar, first deputy prime minister of 
the government of Russia, is our interlocutor. 
  [Panova] Yegor Timurovich, before we ask you questions about 
the plans of the government, we would like to ask how you 
personally assess the path traveled by the country since the 
fall of 1991, when the policy which has come to be called the 
"Gaydar reforms" began? 
  [Gaydar] Let me answer two questions at once--about the 
reform process, i.e., the way the reforms were carried out, and 
about the intermediate result, i.e., what the reforms have 
brought about. 
  The reform process has been extremely contradictory, and 
transformations have proceeded quite inconsistently. It is the 
custom in our country to address rebukes to some generic 
authority; however, it should be understood that authority as a 
united entity or at least noncontradictory has not existed in 
our country so far. The government was involved in continuous 
confrontation with the Supreme Soviet, which did everything to 
stop the reforms. As is now obvious to all, various trends also 
existed within the government, and the reformist line was not 
necessarily dominant. We were forced to agree to numerous 
compromises and retreat on many significant nuances in order to 
salvage the key point. This inconsistency was perceived by both 
specialists and the population. The choice we had was either to 
do what was possible while consenting to much of what we 
considered incorrect, but taking what we viewed as fundamental 
steps, or, "saving face," become the opposition and observe, 
this time from the sidelines, how the country would waste an 
opportunity to overcome the crisis. We preferred the path of 
compromise, although perhaps we disappointed a segment of our 
supporters in this manner. 
  As far as the results of these two years are concerned, I 
cannot agree in any way with apocalyptic assessments which are 
quite frequently published in the press. On the contrary, 
clear-cut favorable trends have emerged in the economy of 
Russia. Strange as it may seem, the word "success" is 
considerably more fitting for Russian reforms than the word 
"failure." 
  Our current situation should not be compared to the United 
States or Germany but rather to our own situation as of two 
years ago, as well as to the tendencies and expectations we had 
at that time. Recall the fall of 1991--complete breakdown of the 
market, empty stores, the dominance of barter, humiliating hours 
in lines, and the feeling of hopelessness. There were a great 
many predictions of famine, cold, and rebellion. One may be as 
critical of the activities of the government as one wants, but 
it is impossible not to acknowledge that these predictions have 
failed to come true. Not only have we survived, but we feel much 
more confident than two years ago. For example, even the most 
irresponsible people do not discuss the threat of famine at 
present. 
  In general, when our opponents now enumerate the troubles of 
the Russian economy with an accusatory intonation, we would like 
to ask the basis for their belief that it could have been 
easier? At the time of disintegration of the USSR several crises 
at once were superimposed over one another. The output of energy 
resources--the main item in Russian exports--declined sharply. 
Due to the attempts of the last union government to patch up the 
holes with the use of Western credit, Russia fell into a debt 
trap. An irresponsible financial policy brought about the 
emergence of a huge merchandise deficit and the actual 
depreciation of the savings of the population, which really 
perished right then, in the years of perestroyka. In January 
1992 this merely became obvious. 
  Of course, the standard of living of a majority of the 
population is still very low. However, in this instance, too, 
everything is not as bad as it appears to be. In the last 10 
months the real income of the population has not declined, and 
if we were to compare it to the beginning of 1993, it has 
increased. 
  Therefore, despite the situation remaining quite complex, 
with quite a few things not working out the way we had planned, 
I view the results of the past period favorably. 
  [Panova] As you see it, what should be the key priorities of 
economic policy for the next year or two? 
  [Gaydar] Our main task is to ensure a break in the 
inflationary spiral and ensure the predictability of key 
economic parameters in the production sphere. 
  For this purpose, it is necessary to consistently reduce all 
types of subsidies in the production sphere in 1994: import 
subsidies, preferential credit, and credit extended to the 
states of the Commonwealth, and to bring the deficit to a volume 
not exceeding 5 percent of the gross domestic product. 
  In turn, this will make it possible to abandon the financing 
of the budget deficit through emission by the end of 1994, and 
to switch to financing it from healthy sources, both domestic 
(state treasury bonds) and foreign. 
  The rate of growth of the money supply will drop from 10 
percent per month in early 1994 to 3 percent per month at the 
end of the year. This will make it possible to maintain a 
relatively stable rate of depreciation of the ruble against the 
dollar, not to exceed one-half of the rate of inflation. The 
currency exchange rate, relatively cheaper imported goods, and 
the strengthening of price competition on this basis--all of 
these may be used to slow down inflation from 15 percent a month 
at the beginning of 1994 to 5 percent a month at the end of 1994. 
  Subsequently, as the rate of inflation drops, prerequisites 
will be created for lowering the discount rate of the Central 
Bank, lowering the interest rate on the market, and, 
correspondingly, the growth of private investment in the 
production sector. 
  [Panova] What awaits us in the sphere of taxation? 
  [Gaydar] Unfortunately, in the environment of a considerable 
budget deficit there will be no opportunity to reduce the burden 
of taxes in 1994. At present the level of tax withholdings comes 
to 50 percent of the gross domestic product; a real reduction in 
it may be discussed no earlier than 1995. The key directions in 
this area are: reducing taxation of wages (withholdings for 
social security), and canceling levies on above-the-norm labor 
compensation fund. 
  The codification of a universal form of distribution of 
taxes 
to the levels of the budget system, between the federal budget 
and the territories, a transition from customized norms for each 
region established in the process of bureaucratic bargaining to 
universal rules, with appropriate support to poorly developed 
regions--such is the substantial advance which may and should 
occur in 1994. 
  An increase in taxes on factors of production--natural 
resources, real estate--as a share of the total volume of taxes 
is yet another long-range avenue for the system of taxation. 
However, this will only become possible after a low level of 
inflation is attained. 
  [Panova] People have the impression that the government's 
tax 
policy encourages only commerce and banking, but makes 
operations in the production sphere unprofitable. 
  [Gaydar] Generally speaking, our taxes are the same for both 
production and commerce. However, the effect you mentioned 
exists as a consequence of the so-called inflationary tax. The 
inflationary tax means losses which the owners of monetary 
savings suffer as a result of high inflation. Naturally, losses 
due to the inflationary tax are not comparable to profits in 
commerce and the banking sector, in which money is turned around 
quickly. In turn, these losses are very significant in 
production, especially in sectors with a long production cycle, 
and for the population. 
  This problem cannot be solved through differentiated 
taxation 
of the spheres of production and distribution; after all, 
increased taxes in the sphere of distribution will cause massive 
tax evasion. This is why there is only one way to even out 
conditions for taxation--it is to stop inflation. 
  [Panova] Will the privatization policy undergo changes? 
  [Gaydar] As we discuss the process of privatization, we 
should compare what has already been accomplished in the course 
of it with what is yet to be done in the long term. 
  Privatization in Russia is unprecedented in scope and not 
comparable to the experience of any of the countries of the 
world. There are monumental technical difficulties in its path 
here affecting the forms of privatization, the system of 
vouchers, and the appraisal of privatized property. 
  All of these are objective aspects. 
  However, there are also subjective aspects. We are not the 
authors of the privatization program--we proposed a different 
program which did not have such great preferences for labor 
collectives, that is, the point for which we are now being 
criticized. 
  However, decisions were made by the Supreme Soviet, often 
contrary to our opinion; as a result we have a compromise 
version of the program with many flaws. 
  We cannot change the rules of the game in the middle without 
the risk of triggering major social conflicts; this is why we 
should conduct the current stage of privatization to the end and 
change the rules gradually. 
  Property has already been distributed, but effective control 
over it by the new owners has been absent so far. The role of 
the management and labor collectives is clearly excessive. This 
is why the most pressing task is to create effective owners, to 
establish rules and procedures for the redistribution of 
property, and to create a system counteracting all attempts to 
squander such property. In this instance, the role of investment 
funds as outside coowners of enterprises in resisting the 
arbitrary rule of directors is very great. 
  We are making a transition from the system of handing out 
property free of charge to selling it, from unconditional 
privatization to privatization conditioned on additional 
investment. 
  [Panova] At present, everyone agrees that structural changes 
in our industry are necessary. What would be your description of 
the situation in this sphere? Are structural changes underway in 
our country? Are you satisfied with this process? 
  [Gaydar] Of course, structural changes are progressing, and 
they are not progressing poorly. Statements about a profound 
crisis in industry or fatal declines in production are either 
manifestations of incompetence or simply deliberate distortions 
of the facts. 
  Let us look specifically at areas where we have considerable 
declines in production, for example, light industry. However, 
many light industry enterprises were so ineffective that they 
generated a negative value added for our entire industry, 
whereby the total cost of output was less than the cost of 
resources consumed in production. The "production of the means 
of production"--machine tools for the production of machine 
tools, metal for the machine tools producing machine tools, 
power for smelting this metal, and so on--which is well-known 
from school textbooks, is also declining in our country. On the 
contrary, the share of civilian machine building and the food 
industry in the structure of the national economy (in constant 
prices) is increasing. The strengthening market mechanisms is 
throwing up a barrier in the path of producing everything that 
is not associated in any way with meeting human needs. Industry 
for the sake of industry, which indeed is a peculiar 
accomplishment of ours, is yielding to production for the sake 
of the people, however slowly and with resistance. 
  Certainly, such a decline is beneficial. It is no accident 
that, until a few months ago, the total level of decline in 
production in Ukraine was lower than in Russia, whereas the 
standard of living fell considerably more than in our country, 
and social tensions were greater, to boot. We are gradually 
getting rid of that production which was pulling us to the 
bottom. 
  It is necessary to note one more aspect here which is 
important in principle. So far, the process of structural change 
has proceeded without major social upheaval and against the 
background of a quite low unemployment rate. For two years now 
they have been promising us the 20 million level of 
unemployment. However, at present the rate of unemployment does 
not by any means exceed 3 percent, even with the inclusion of 
those who are on forced leave. We have every reason to believe 
that in the coming 1.5 years the unemployment rate will remain 
quite low. Nonetheless, the government is attentively following 
the situation in the labor market. We have developed special 
programs of aid to the unemployed and retraining for those who, 
having lost their jobs, would like to train in new professions.

"What Will Russia's Choice Be? The Reforms Must Be Started All 
Over Again"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Prospects </H5>
  Why, actually, is there the widespread opinion that 
democracy 
failed in the December elections? There is no doubt that the 
results of the elections were unexpected and many people were 
simply shocked. It is also true that we are still a long way 
from true democracy and recognized political pluralism. But even 
under these, to put it mildly, extraordinary conditions, after 
the bloody crisis in October and two months of actual 
authoritarianism, democracy immediately produced its results as 
soon as the valve of the election points was opened up for it. 
  These results come from the working of a feedback mechanism 
between the people and the state leaders. This is one of the 
fundamental and indispensable functions of democracy and it is 
manifested most distinctly through general elections. 
  Here again we should not console ourselves with illusions. 
The loss by the government party, Russia's Choice (whose 
presumptuous name now sounds rather amusing), and the immense 
shortage of democratic and centrist blocs along with the solid 
success of the nationalists and communists cannot be explained 
away by random or attendant factors. 
  Essentially the Russian people gave the strictest warning to 
the ruling circles that they must not continue to rule in this 
way. The social organism is sending a strong and painful signal 
to the effect that it is seriously ill and the course of 
treatment of the past two years has not brought improvement but 
has severely exacerbated the disease. But this pain itself is 
both dangerous and salutary at the same time. 
  It is dangerous because if the previous policy is continued 
the pain will increase and ultimately destroy the organism; it 
will cause irreversible degeneration and then death. It is 
salutary because if the signal is taken seriously and the course 
of treatment is correctly altered there will be every 
possibility of averting tragedy. In the situation that has 
developed, both a negligent attitude toward the results of the 
elections and gloomy fatalism or panic are equally destructive. 
  And it is not that "the people are always right"--history 
provides many examples of nationwide self-destruction, including 
through fascism, imperialism, and militarism. It is simply that 
the people are what they are and any program of reform must be 
adapted to this particular country with all of its specific 
features. The reverse will not work: the people cannot be 
selected to fit the program. No theoretically ideal reform is 
worth its salt if it works for distant England or even nearby 
Poland but is rejected by Russia and opens up access to power 
for extremists. Nobody except the people themselves can carry 
out a reform in Russia, and if an immense and ever increasing 
part of the society lets the ship of reform pass them by, 
ultimately it will be overturned and everything will sink to the 
bottom: advanced and backward, right and wrong. 
  The main truth of the current moment is that the majority 
who 
voted for Zhirinovskiy are not so stupid and naive as to believe 
his easy promises and give themselves over to cheap demagogy. 
They voted that way out of a feeling of protest against what is 
happening in the country and also because they did not see any 
clear and attractive alternative. Herein also lies the key to 
the solution to the problem, the path to the rescue of the 
democratic reforms. 
  In his speech on 22 December President Yeltsin noted that 
the 
elections to the Duma showed that the administration is "falling 
short of its task." I am afraid that the president was being too 
kind to himself and his subordinates. In the current situation 
this is very alarming. We have had enough of protecting the 
president from criticism, from truthful information about the 
real state of affairs, from nondepartmental assessments of the 
prospects for economic and social development, from what people 
are saying about him and his government. To offend and anger the 
president is less dangerous now than to indulge the complacency 
which has already manifested itself so fatally during the 
election campaign. 
  The bitter truth is that the preceding state of the reforms 
was a failure, and cosmetic patching up, personnel reshuffling, 
and administrative leapfrog will not rectify the situation. We 
must no longer speak about "continuing the course of the 
reforms" but about radically revising both the methods of 
development of the policy and the policy itself. 
  Over a period of two years industry has declined by 40 
percent, and more in consumer goods production than in defense 
and heavy industry. Actual consumption decreased by 40-60 
percent. Some 30 percent of the population ended up on the brink 
of disaster. The structure of the economy changed even more in 
the "Soviet" direction--in favor of the extraction branches. The 
same thing pertains to exports. The national currency is 
"working" only in the sense of its being exchanged for freely 
convertible currency, and nobody uses it for savings or 
investments. 
  Just an enumeration of the various aspects of the 
unprecedented collapse, degeneration, and uncontrolled behavior 
that have appeared in all areas of our life would take up too 
much space, and quite enough has been written and said about 
this. It is important not to console ourselves with illusions, 
as though these are temporary difficulties and it is impossible 
to carry out such great transformations without them. The 
previous policy has completely exhausted itself and we are left 
with a delicate balance between hyperinflation and 
hyperunemployment, and its continuation will ultimately lead to 
both of the above at the same time. 
  I will not resort to the assessments of nongovernmental 
economists such as Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Nikolay Petrakov, Oleg 
Bogomolov, or Stanislav Shatalin--they too are sufficiently well 
known. I will turn to the statements of Yegor Gaydar, who even 
after the elections stated once again that the government's main 
goal is to put an end to inflation through a balanced budget so 
as to provide for savings and investments and thus bring about 
economic growth. And it was literally right at this point that 
he admitted that demonopolization and privatization were not 
working and it was not without irony that he called for everyone 
who has solutions to these problems to support the government. 
  How can that be? After all, without demonopolization and 
real 
privatization the mechanism for investments, competition, and 
economic growth will never begin to work. To find the practical 
solutions the first deputy prime minister is asking for would 
indeed be extremely difficult. But without them how can we count 
on any economic growth (except in the sphere of trade and 
speculation) even with decontrolled prices? After all, now 87 
percent of Russian enterprises either belong to the state or 
controlling blocks of shares in them are in the hands of 
bureaucrats. 
  The mechanism for self-perpetuating inflation is implanted 
in 
the very basis of the "liberalized" Soviet economy, which has 
obtained as a result of a two-year attraction to monetarism. It 
was revealed by an adviser and advocate of the government 
program, Yevgeniy Yasin: If we produce money--prices will 
increase because there will be more money; if we do not produce 
money--prices will increase because production will decline and 
there will be fewer goods. 
  If there is no solution to the key problems of 
demonopolization and privatization so far, we must search for 
them with redoubled energy and for the time being abandon all 
hope of a deficit-free budget and "financial stabilization." 
Free prices and full store shelves that are accessible to the 
minority, exchanges, commercials, vouchers, and shares--all 
these are merely the wrappings, an imitation of a market economy 
without the internal motive mechanisms. It will never work just 
as the Papuan plane will not fly (after the war natives of Papua 
went out into the meadows and began to build a facsimile of an 
aircraft out of branches in the hope that the kindly Americans 
would fly to them again and bring them cigarettes and chocolate). 
  If, having gone through the cycles of the fight against 
inflation, we turn the financial screws even tighter, abolish 
subsidies, and no longer provide wages and cut state social 
programs (as Boris Fedorov suggests) the economy will simply 
grind to a halt and tens of millions of people will be left 
without a means of existence. Then who will handle the 
accumulations? And what will they invest in even if there is 
zero inflation? And what kind of political stability can one 
hope for by 1996 with this kind of situation? 
  After all, ultimately a market economy is not a goal in 
itself. Democracy is impossible without it, but a market economy 
in and of itself by no means guarantees democracy and progress. 
Both Bangladesh and Somalia have market economies too, but they 
have neither democracy nor prosperity. Nor should one forget 
that Hitler's Germany was based on a market economy and it lived 
in harmony with concentration camps, Gestapo terror, and an 
all-out suicidal war. The price and costs of reform are not as 
important as the final goal--70 years on a path to a "bright 
future" should have taught everyone this. 
  What we need now is not switching of offices but the 
creation 
under the president of a broad independent committee of leading 
experts so as, in the first place, to clarify on the basis of 
complete information the real state of affairs resulting from 
these two years of reformism and to tell the whole truth, 
regardless of how bitter it may be. And, in the second place, to 
suggest ways of getting out of the crisis irrespective of dogma 
and the personal affiliations of officials, tailoring them to 
the objective conditions of the Russian economy and 
sociopolitical situation. This path must be followed based on 
the broadest possible coalition of all democratic forces of the 
society and above all the parliamentary factions. 
  In this connection we may speak about the unity of 
democratic 
forces. Anatoliy Chubays and many Russia's Choicers after him 
hastened to lay the blame for the results of the elections on 
other democratic blocs which supposedly fragmented the reformer 
front. But that is nothing but an attempt to shift the blame. If 
all these parties were to form a bloc with Russia's Choice they 
would have simply divided up among themselves the same 
electorate that voted for Choice. And their own followers either 
would not have participated in the elections at all or some of 
them would have voted for Communists, increasing their 
representation in parliament even more. 
  The main mistake of the democrats who did not belong to 
Russia's Choice was that they were unable to join together and 
were unable to provide a democratic alternative to the course of 
the government and Russia's Choice that was clear-cut and 
attractive to everyone who was not against reforms and democracy 
in principle but would not accept what had been done in the 
country during the past two years. If this had happened the 
democratic opposition would have had many more positions, and 
the Communists and nationalists would have had fewer. 
  Extensive unification of democratic forces, and above all in 
parliament, is more necessary now than ever before. But not on 
the basis of collective suicide, automatically following Gaydar 
down a blind alley, but on the basis of a radical revision of 
it. And it would be desirable, of course, together with 
Choice..., the government and the president, if they were to 
draw the correct conclusions in the December elections. 
  The question of the new constitution is closely linked to 
this. Specifically, it would be a great mistake to rely, as 
Vladimir Shumeyko and certain other figures close to the 
president are now suggesting, on the authority of the executive 
power enlarged in the constitution and the curtailed rights of 
parliament. 
  The main problem is that the Basic Law appeared on earth 
with 
grave inherent flaws. They were brought about by the secrecy of 
its development, the open pressure of free discussion, and the 
relaxed procedure for adoption, which allowed the constitution 
to pass with the support of only a few more than one-fourth of 
the voters. 
  An easy victory does not cost much, and the objective 
achieved at this price may quite well turn out to be illusory. A 
constitution that has not undergone the difficult test of the 
broadest public discussion, which does not fully reflect the 
balance of forces and the consensus of the main political forces 
in the country, which has not received the endorsement of the 
real majority of the voters--is not likely to really become the 
basic law of life of our immense state. Either the constitution 
will be transformed into an object of political confrontation 
from the very beginning or it will be simply ignored by all 
parties and will motivate them to search for nonconstitutional 
forms of struggle. 
  With a continuation of the previous policy, even if there 
are 
partial adjustments, the sociopolitical balance of forces will 
inexorably change in the direction against the president and 
lead to his isolation, and no written prerogatives will help him 
retain control of the situation. (Thus all of the extreme 
provisions turned out to be ephemeral for Mikhail Gorbachev in 
1991.) But with a radical change in policy and the formation of 
a broad coalition in support of democracy and the new course of 
the reforms the domination of the president and the executive 
structures will be simply superfluous and excessively burdensome 
for them since it would impede efficient division of labor and 
responsibility among the branches of power. 
  Another extremely serious illusion is that conducting the 
reforms requires maximum concentration of power in the president 
and the executive organs. Proponents of "enlightened 
authoritarianism"--from Andranik Migranyan to Valeriy 
Novodvorskiy--are defending this idea especially actively now in 
light of the results of the election and the adoption of the new 
constitution. Well, we will have no problems with 
authoritarianism, we are used to that. The only question is how 
to ensure enlightenment. 
  Possibly during the times of Petr I, who adorns the emblem 
of 
Russia's Choice, there was no other way than to "write edicts 
with the knout." Probably even in our day there is no other way 
in a number of Asian countries. But for a nation that is 
basically European such a path holds no promise. Political 
oppression beats down the people's economic activity as well, 
and for market reforms, as distinct from Petr's or Stalin's, it 
is above all necessary to have lively participation, 
enterprisingness, self-expression, and self-respect of the 
largest possible proportion of the population. The state must 
merely direct them into a civilized, legal channel. 
  Hopes placed in the personal qualities of Boris Yeltsin, who 
will not abuse power, are completely naive, and not simply 
because man is mortal and his character can deteriorate, as the 
president himself recently admitted in an exchange with Eldar 
Ryazanov. The problem is much deeper. Authoritarianism gives the 
leader only the illusion of a free hand. But in fact by 
releasing him from restrictions imposed by the parliament, the 
courts, the press, and public opinion, at the same time it makes 
him a slave to the bureaucratic complex and a victim of intrigue 
and bickering among favorites for positions closer to the 
throne. They are the ones who stand to gain from 
authoritarianism, and not the leader-reformer. 
  As distinct from democratic freedoms and a system of checks 
and balances, a bureaucracy works unimpeded to refine the art of 
selecting information. It skillfully leads the leader to the 
decisions it needs, interprets their practical implications 
according to its own will, and does not allow the possibility of 
monitoring execution or obtaining an objective assessment of the 
results. An example of this--the long-awaited edict on the 
land--has already been provided during the short period of the 
presidential monopoly. They hastened to adopt it before the 
legislators could get in their way and it immediately turned 
into its opposite, strengthening even more the rural 
nomenklatura's power and possibilities of getting rich. 
  True freedom--within the framework of constitutional 
authority, of course--is provided to the leader only by a 
democratic environment that presents alternative sources of 
information and the possibility, in conjunction with the 
legislative and judicial powers, of controlling the bureaucracy. 
But this kind of system will not tolerate arbitrariness on the 
part of the president and will force him to engage in constant 
political work to ensure parliamentary support for his policy, 
and it will place high demands on the reputation of his 
subordinates to preserve the reputation of the entire 
administration. 
  It is understandable that democracy does not work according 
to the ideal plan anywhere. It certainly does not provide a 
guarantee against mistakes, and sometimes serious ones. The 
point is this: the absence of democracy, regardless of the 
personality of the leaders, guarantees mistakes and the 
impossibility of correcting them promptly and, ultimately, the 
failure of the policy and the state. This pertains fully to the 
current Russian reforms as well. 
  In an authoritarian system the leader will very soon be 
forced to serve the interests of the nomenklatura and above all 
its power structures. Otherwise they will simply remove him or 
make him ineffective. Both Khrushchev and Gorbachev learned this 
through experience. On this plane, the fact that the Third Army, 
in spite of an order to vote for Choice..., voted for the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] is as alarming as it is 
explicable. 
  With respect to the army, President Yeltsin committed one of 
the most serious of his mistakes, and it was of a dual nature. 
On the one hand, in two years nothing was done to establish 
effective political control over the army. On the other 
hand--the military were drawn into internal political conflicts 
against their will, which reached its culmination in October. 
Both of these are dangerous individually, and together--even 
more so. After the elimination of the army political organs the 
armed forces were essentially left on their own. In order to 
survive under the conditions that have developed in recent years 
they needed radical reform. But no state department anywhere is 
ever able to reform itself. The more so one like the military: 
with its rigid hierarchy, deep traditions, enormous departmental 
structure, and the existing economy. Without strong and 
purposeful political leadership the reform of the army was 
clearly doomed. It did not succeed, and as a result even the 
concept of "military reform" disappeared from the recently 
adopted military doctrine. 
  The army ended up in an extremely difficult condition: the 
state did not have the funds to reduce and reorganize it and 
there was no money to maintain it at its present size. Hence the 
growing dissatisfaction among the military because of the 
failure to solve numerous problems, of which the shortage of 
housing, the failure to pay salaries, and the shortages in 
recruitment are only the most critical. 
  Political control of the army cannot be based on good 
relations between the president and the minister of defense. 
Personal factors are too fragile and changeable a basis for such 
a complex and important matter. Real political control over the 
army is possible only under two conditions: the existence of a 
civilian ministry of defense with its own apparatus and the 
active role of parliament in all aspects of defense policy. 
These are indispensable conditions for a democratic structure. 
There are democratic countries that have no armed forces at all, 
but there is no country with an army that does not have the two 
aforementioned conditions for civilian control. And, conversely, 
in all authoritarian regimes the military is in charge of the 
ministry of defense and frequently combines this post with the 
presidency. It is not without reason the Soviet leaders too 
(Stalin, Brezhnev) loved to amuse themselves with high military 
ranks and luxurious uniforms. 
  All this is no accident and it is certainly not a matter of 
the intellectual and psychological peculiarities of the 
military. The essence is that institutionally the most 
intelligent and peace-loving military leader in the post of 
minister of defense will always be a representative of the army 
in the government. And the most narrow-minded and rigid civilian 
person will always be a representative of the president in the 
army and a proponent of his policy. The minister is also the 
intermediary between the military and the parliament, which 
raises difficult questions and checks on efficient expenditure 
of allocations. 
  The new constitution and military doctrine have established 
practically complete elimination of parliament from military 
affairs. All control has legally been placed in the hands of the 
president, but this is merely on paper. In fact he remains one 
on one with a giant military establishment and himself is 
dependent on it. This "feedback" is so great that the army is 
drawn into internal political conflicts in an inadmissible way 
and has actually been made the arbitrator in their resolution. 
  Indeed, during the October events the armed forces against 
their will had to choose for themselves which president and 
minister of defense to obey. And then they had to perform 
functions that are not appropriate for the army, which dealt a 
stronger blow to the prestige and moral condition of the army 
than August 1991 did. Even worse is that these functions have 
now been officially assigned to the army according to the new 
military doctrine, as though we do not have enough internal 
forces, specialized subdivisions, and OMON's [Special Purpose 
Militia Detachments]. 
  Voting for the LDPR is not only a sign of protest against 
the 
terrible disintegration in the armed forces. And it is not only 
a response to Zhirinovskiy's military-patriotic advances. To an 
enormous degree it is also an expression of an attitude toward 
the October events, a strict warning to the head of state. 
  And no purges or punishments will help here. They will 
alienate the military even more and place them in opposition to 
the political leadership. We need an in-depth reinterpretation 
of the policy of the Russian leadership in the military sphere 
and a radical change in the mechanism for political control of 
the army and the decisionmaking system. Regardless of what the 
level and composition of the armed forces may be, the army must 
be fully provided with everything necessary to carry out its 
tasks, occupy a worthy position in society, be under effective 
civilian control, and be completely removed from deciding issues 
of internal politics. 
  Today everything is proceeding in precisely the opposite 
direction. If things continue this way, the army will decide 
that it can remove and install presidents. (And here Russia has 
the great traditions of the Streltsy, the Preobrazhensk units, 
and the Semenovites.) Relying on force is a double-edged sword 
and it is far from being as obedient a weapon as it might seem. 
The power game is a game in which democracy will always be 
defeated. In this game President Yeltsin will find stronger and 
more perfidious rivals, and they will not be linked to the 
turbulent history of 1991-1993. 
  Democratic reforms in both the economy and politics may be 
carried out only within the framework of a rule-of-law state, on 
the basis of a balance of interests of all nonextremist groups 
of the society. Force creates only the illusion of a rapid and 
radical solution to problems. In fact force cannot solve a 
single problem of democratic construction; it only exacerbates 
problems and produces diametrically opposite results.

<F P=106> [Article by Valentin Fedorov, Russian Federation deputy </F>
minister of economics, and Stella Boyko (Russian Academy of 
Management): "Nature of Economic Mistakes"] 
  [Text] Mistakes in economic policy are inevitable under any 
system of management. However, the degree of their gravity is 
different. In order to reduce the probability of committing new 
errors, it is necessary to analyze the objective nature of their 
occurrence. 
  Let us first turn to the market (Western) economy. 
Developing 
cyclically, that is, when from time to time a boom is 
interrupted by an absolute slump, it thus is able to check the 
quality of its existence during relatively short periods of time 
and, having adopted a healing measure in the form of an 
overproduction crisis, eliminates the disproportions and moves 
forward. A happy surprise can befall it on this path: while 
cyclicity is maintained, it can enter the phase of accelerated 
advanced transformations for decades. Not every national economy 
manages to realize such a chance. The point is that two types of 
progress are characteristic of the economy. 
  The first--a cyclical ascent upwards, as though climbing 
along the spiral to the Tower of Pisa. It does not depend much 
on the economic management of the authorities. Even if the worst 
variant is allowed, that is, for some reasons the government 
would hamper a recovery from the cyclical crisis, the movement 
of the economy itself would break the resistance of the 
administration. By now Western economic science has developed a 
number of generally accepted rules of anticrisis policy. 
Fulfilling them, the government can save its face even if these 
rules are incorrect from the point of view of their positive 
effect on the final result (it is impossible to prove anything 
mathematically). The cyclical crisis contains the automatism of 
overcoming itself in a short space of time. 
  Consequently, the sense of the policy of management in 
countries with a market economy lies not so much in eliminating 
the cyclical upheaval as in solving another problem: how to lead 
the economy to a higher plane of development, that is, to ensure 
conditions for the second type of progress. 
  Economic history gives several facts of this type. One 
country or another, which until a certain time was not noted for 
special economic advances, suddenly begins to sharply outpace 
its competitors in key indicators. Germany and Japan have become 
chrestomathic examples. New industrial countries in Southeast 
Asia are now making a spurt. At one time Soviet science did not 
ignore this matter. However, it examined it from its own 
specific point of view. Many works on the unevenness of economic 
and political development of countries during the era of 
imperialism were written for the purpose of searching and 
substantiating the weak link in the chain of imperialism, which 
falls out from it and becomes socialist. 
  Be that as it may, not every country and, all the more, not 
every government is lucky history-wise. Therefore, cases of an 
economic spurt are extraordinary. They do not lend themselves to 
forecasting and, owing to their isolated nature, are not subject 
to generalization. 
  The situation with a centrally managed economy looks 
different. A cyclical movement is absent here and, therefore, 
even the minimum of (cyclical) progress contained in the genes 
of capitalism is not guaranteed. However, we did not need the 
minimum, because the planned system set for itself the task of 
attaining the maximum possible on the basis of the fact that 
everything can be envisaged and calculated. Here, however, we 
have encountered a phenomenon, which has not yet been fully 
recognized in our country. It is a matter of the unknowability 
of the economy. 
  Unknowability of the economy begins from an analysis of its 
past. First, with a potential multiplicity of variants only one 
variant is realized and, in principle, it is impossible to 
calculate or demonstrate whether it was optimal. It is only 
possible to assume, taking into consideration political, moral, 
and military factors, which do not lend themselves to a 
quantitative measurement. During an evaluation of the past, 
public opinion can lean toward any side, which is represented, 
for example, either by a single monopoly opinion, or by a 
majority of votes, or by disarming eloquence. Second, similar 
insurmountable difficulties arise during a retrospective 
analysis of the most realized variant of development and during 
the clarification of the question of what affected it to a 
greater, and what, to a lesser extent, and whether everything 
that affected it is known. 
  Third, it is impossible to grasp the intricacies of current 
economic development at every moment. 
  Economy as such is the absolute truth and only its small 
part 
is accessible to us. Possessing only relative truth, during the 
Soviet era we used the entire power of the state apparatus for 
the formation of a process, the scale, structure, and nature of 
which were not clear to us from the very beginning. The nature 
of past economic mistakes lies precisely here. 
  State planning did not withstand the gravity of assumed 
responsibility and the economy secured by nothing fell into a 
crisis, which differs from the cyclical one by the fact that it 
does not contain any self-overcoming automatism. They strove for 
the target maximum, but fell below the market minimum. During 
favorable periods, when the planned economy externally 
demonstrated tangible achievements, cardinal disproportions 
ripened and large-scale flaws were allowed in it. When they 
became obvious, their elimination occurred according to the same 
scenario: the rectification of the situation simultaneously 
created foci of new omissions and even crimes, for which we had 
to pay during and after decades. 
  The sum of economic knowledge available today objectively 
permits neither us nor the West to declare ourselves dictators 
of such a most complex phenomenon as social reproduction. The 
experienced West does not even try to do this and, therefore, 
does not make mistakes similar to ours. Local experts understand 
the fundamental self-regulation of the market economy. They 
reduce the economic role of the state to fine tuning, correctly 
thinking that decisive proportions determine the market. Of 
course, the development of productive forces forces the state to 
participate in economic life to a greater extent than earlier. 
However, even in the era of computers and information science it 
is aware of its secondary role. Private property gives rise to a 
natural movement of things. It creates a superstructure over 
itself and redistribution relations, which, clashing and 
becoming balanced in varieties among themselves, ensure the 
functioning of the entire economic mechanism. 
  What is the way out? The continuation of previous economic 
policy would be hopeless for the country. However, giving it up, 
it would be incorrect to copy criteria for market behavior 
characteristic of Western functionaries (as yet there are no 
real prerequisites for this). We face another kind of task: to 
lead the country to a guaranteed (cyclical) minimum of progress. 
We cannot wait any longer. The present situation creates for 
Russia a growing lag behind Western powers, whose economy goes 
forward despite any crises and contradictions. 
  The market system steadily becomes complicated and this, 
perhaps, is the most dangerous factor for us from the point of 
view of the strategic race. The complication of the economy 
involves a constant and intensive enrichment of Western experts 
with new knowledge, which, in turn, improves the quality of 
state economic management. Right now Western economists possess 
a bigger arsenal of knowledge than our science and practice. Our 
own chance should be seen in the development of a market nature 
of the economy, which will ensure its efficiency in all cases, 
even with the current mistakes of the country's administration. 
The latter should concentrate on the main question--how to lend 
an additional speed to the development of the market. Only then 
will the chance to carry out the second type of progress become 
realistic. 
  Thus, in order to be equal in potentialities with market 
countries, we will have to meet two indispensable conditions. 
  First: to accelerate the development of the market 
environment. 
  Second: having discarded the burden of microeconomic 
concerns, state bodies should create for the economy 
strategically favorable conditions for a long boom. This 
requires high professional competence. We can acquire it only 
with our own experience and only after the realization of the 
first condition.

<F P=106> [Article by Rustam Narzikulov under the rubric "Expert </F>
Opinion": "The Liberation From Superliberalism; the 
Decommercialization of the Russian State"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Institutional Changes </H5>
  Two main features have shaped Russia's economic development 
during the last decade of the twentieth century, during which 
the country was trying to create normal market institutions. The 
first was a complete absence of private capital at the initial 
point of the economic reform started in 1992. From this 
standpoint the 1990's may be called the era of post-Soviet 
initial accumulation of capital. The second characteristic trait 
of the economic and political system of the country was an 
extremely weak state, completely destroyed during the 
post-communist period. 
  The combination of these two features created in Russia an 
extremely peculiar economic environment that did not exist in 
any country implementing reforms. Other former socialist 
countries also encountered the absence of private ownership, but 
in none of them was the deterioration of state ties so 
all-encompassing. Therefore in Russia, despite the attempts to 
apply canonical and overall correct methods for creating a 
market, the result was the emergence of a unique economy. 
  In general terms it may be characterized as liberalism 
pushed 
to the extreme and made possible by the powerlessness of the 
state, or superliberalism. In whichever economic sphere the 
state attempted to operate (prices, money, the budget system, 
privatization, foreign trade, and so on), at best it was able to 
set general directions for development, but all attempts at 
purposeful regulation were unsuccessful. This happened because 
the old mechanism of macroeconomic management, which went under 
the name of "bargaining over a plan" or "bureaucratic 
capitalism," did not disappear as the old state disintegrated; 
it only transformed itself. 
  Some state bureaucrats, who retained control over production 
links, budget means, and the ability to distribute (not goods, 
as before, but this time subsidies) began to swell the ranks of 
the fast-growing entrepreneurial class. Others, who stayed in 
the service of the government and local authorities, for all 
practical purposes commercialized the state mechanism, for their 
interaction with business predominantly occurred in the form of 
remunerative relations. The state apparatus turned into one 
gigantic commercial company or, to be precise, a whole system of 
companies linked together by complex interconnected interests 
and mutual obligations. 
  The all-out commercialization is that superliberalism by 
whose laws Russia lived and which immediately scared the 
foreigners terribly. The subjects of developed Western countries 
were used to competing within the framework of rules established 
from above, in which whoever finds the best combination of 
utilizing these rules, wins. In the Russia of the beginning 
1990's, the winners were those who could maneuver the state into 
rigging the rules in their favor. Russia also began to scare the 
West by its new penetration of world markets since, having 
gotten used to the conditional nature of any imperative, Russian 
businessmen began to break the established rules of the game in 
this area as well (first and foremost by engaging in massive 
dumping). 
  Today the situation is beginning to change. The era of 
initial accumulation of capital has practically come to an end; 
a class of proprietors has formed who are becoming increasingly 
unhappy about the commercial nature of relations with the state. 
They are sick and tired of engaging in unlawful contact with all 
bureaucrats, from tax inspector and Central Bank teller to prime 
minister. A powerful social force has emerged--class solidarity 
of the new bourgeoisie in their struggle against a specific 
government business. On the other hand, after the "great 
reshuffling" of property had been completed, the state lost the 
underpinning of its commercialization. Bureaucrats' 
opportunities for business activities declined sharply. The 
state is beginning to increasingly engage in what should be its 
principal business: setting the rules of the game in the market. 
This arbiter, however, still does not shy away from a bribe and 
whenever possible will not miss the opportunity to profit from 
the problems of others. It is quite risky to engage in it now, 
however, since most businessmen believe that it is more 
expedient to complain about a bureaucrat than to bribe him. 
<H5>  The New Economy </H5>
  At first glance the current sectoral structure of the 
Russian 
economy is less progressive than 10 years ago. The share of the 
primary sector has increased (mainly due to the growth in the 
mining industry while the proportional share of agriculture 
remained unchanged); the share of the processing industry has 
declined, among other things at the expense of complex, 
science-intensive production sectors. This, by the way, has been 
taken up by the political opposition, which maintains that the 
fathers of the economic reform are leading the country into 
deindustrialization. 
  Upon closer inspection, however, it turns out that the 
situation with respect to the economic structure is not that 
bad, to say the least. True, the primary sector's share has 
increased, but is it bad for the country to expand production of 
oil and gas, which until now had produced the bulk of our hard 
currency earnings? Moreover, market reform made it possible to 
attract gigantic foreign investment into the mineral deposits so 
difficult to develop that it is unlikely they would have been 
utilized under the old system. Besides, expansion of the primary 
sector is a temporary phenomenon; it is just that initially for 
both domestic and foreign capital it was the most attractive 
sphere of investment. 
  The proportional share of the processing industry has 
declined, but not because the country took the road of technical 
regression. The reason is that in the former USSR between 70 and 
80 percent of this segment one way or the other was linked to 
the military-industrial complex. And it is quite natural that 
sharp cutbacks in military orders could not help but result in 
closings of gigantic plants producing all sorts of armaments. 
  And, finally, the most convincing argument against all talk 
about "moving backwards" is the fast-growing tertiary 
sector--first and foremost the banking and finance segment, and 
information and transportation sectors. 
  The real problem, however, is that now, after the initial 
structural shifts, which have led to a normal sectoral 
equilibrium, economic development faces two alternatives. Russia 
will either begin pulling itself up toward the models of 
developed countries of the West (reduction of the primary and 
secondary sectors as a result of the fast growth of productivity 
in them, the growth of the tertiary sector due to general 
computerization, a growing service industry, etc.), or the 
current, not the most advanced economic structure, will be 
preserved and Russia will land for a long time in the category 
of medium-developed states of the "Third World." This is where 
the new Russian state should say its word in the environment of 
rejecting that very "superliberalism"--state mechanisms should 
facilitate fast technological development. 
  We should count among the obvious achievements of the reform 
radical changes in the monetary sphere. They may be briefly 
characterized as follows: "Russia now has real money." Of 
course, in the past, too, the Central Bank issued national 
currency, but its periodic and unpredictable devaluation by tens 
of percentage points a month caused people to mistrust it. Let 
us recall 1995 [as published], when dollarization of the country 
and the flight of capital abroad have reached an apogee, foreign 
assets of Russian commercial banks exceeded by a factor of two 
all exports from Russia, and the total volume of hard currency 
in the hands of the population exceeded by the same factor the 
ruble aggregate M0 [cash money in circulation]. Today the 
inflation figures are quite presentable--a modest 15 percent a 
year. One does not have to explain how it has affected the 
entire economy. 
  On the other hand, strange as it may be, a stable ruble and 
the success in combating inflation aggravated the Ministry of 
Finance's problems. While in the past a budget deficit could be 
covered by excessive monetary emission, now the Ministry of 
Finance is experiencing great difficulties, since the Russian 
"middle class," not used to honestly paying taxes, is trying to 
evade this unpleasant procedure by all possible means. As a 
result, tax evasion reaches 60 percent. The minister of finance 
said angrily that if his compatriots "do not like paying taxes," 
perhaps they will consider deductions into the budget as 
charitable contributions to the treasury. 
  Tax evasion also is linked with the shadow economy, which 
has 
remained in place to a great extent. A considerable number of 
small- and medium-size businesses still combine legal and 
semi-legal forms of business activities. And only major 
industrial giants such as Gazprom, YuKOS, LUKoil, and old 
foreign trade companies (Moskva-Nafta, Uraneksportprom, and 
others) attempt to work Western-style, which, by the way, is 
what attracts Western investors to them. At the same time, the 
confidence of partners and consumers is beginning to be seen 
increasingly as a serious intangible asset of a company, which 
creates certain preconditions for the decline of shadow business. 
  The unemployment picture presents a paradox. Contrary to 
expectations, its perceptible growth fell not in the years of 
greatest structural shifts, when armaments production was being 
cut at a fast rate and previously subsidized enterprises were 
closing (1994-1996) [as published] but in later years, by the 
end of the century, when, it would seem, the main structural 
problems had been resolved. Unemployment "arrived late" due to 
an initial extremely low level of the national wage. In 
1993-1996 [as published] the average wage was no more than $50 a 
month: at this kind of wage one does not need to invoke the 
Phillips curve to explain low unemployment rates. Extremely 
cheap labor made it possible for the authorities to forget about 
employment problems in those years. 
  Then the situation changed, however. A fast rising standard 
of living in the society plus hired labor's awareness that wages 
should include all social costs--in the past borne by the state 
(housing, education, child rearing, health care)--caused an 
unprecedented rise in the national level of income. Today the 
average wage is $450 a month, and the young people's 
expectations are much higher. Simultaneously with the growth of 
income, unemployment began to rise. From the initial 1.2 percent 
(the lowest in the world) it rose to 5.7 percent--not too high 
to speak of a catastrophe, but not too low to ignore it. 
  It is unlikely that local methods (paying allowances, 
retraining, public works) will help in combating this social 
ill. A more effective method is increased investment and better 
competitive standing of the Russian economy, which actually 
coincides with the general goals of future economic development.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zasurskiy under the rubric "Reforms": "The </F>
Dualism of Boris Fedorov: Any Radicalism Will End Up 
Crossbreeding Hedgehogs and Grass Snakes"] 
  [Text] Boris Fedorov has always been considered a liaison 
between Russia and the West, which attached a certain weight to 
him in Russian politics. In the past his unwavering intent to 
achieve financial stabilization by any means went hand in hand 
with the confrontation strategy of the Kremlin. It would be 
interesting to see whether this politician is undergoing an 
evolution. 
  The minister's new year's article in IZVESTIYA is 
indicative; 
in it, he appraises the current reforms and offers some 
forecasts regarding the development of the Russian economy in 
the event of a change of course. The inveterate radicalism of 
the very first phrase of this press communication by the deputy 
prime minister makes one shudder: "The current financial policy 
brings out a harsh reaction on the part of the opposition. This 
means that we have succeeded in implementing a consistent 
financial policy." More quotes: "...cutting through fierce 
resistance put up by the Central Bank and a number of members of 
the government," "...despite the resistance on the part of the 
Central Bank and various sectoral lobbies," "our unceasing fight 
against the Supreme Soviet, the Central Bank, and sectoral 
lobbies in the government." 
  Whether Boris Fedorov wants it or not, he is not only the 
minister of finance, but also a politician; and while the first 
part of the article, in which he relates the accomplishments and 
the fighting, shows us the minister of finance, only Fedorov the 
politician could propose a minimum program for any cabinet for 
the next year. 
  What is included in this minimum program? Ensuring truly 
positive interest rates in order to attract savings and "paying 
reasonable compensation from noninflationary sources to citizens 
for losses incurred because of liberalization." The population's 
real income should increase from $100 to $250 a month. It is 
necessary to introduce tax regulators that will reduce the gap 
between the rich and the poor. Inflation should be brought down 
to 5 percent a month--an equivalent of 80 percent a year--in the 
nearest future. As the budget deficit is reduced to 5 percent of 
the GNP and below, the tax burden on producers of goods can be 
reduced. 
  Following that, in order to scare the reader, Boris Fedorov 
presents a list of horrors that will befall us in the event of 
abandoning the reform: prices rising at 2,000 percent a year; an 
exchange rate of 10,000 rubles for a dollar; an increasing 
dollarization of the economy; fixed prices on some goods and 
confiscation of money in the banks; and a shortage of goods. Of 
course, one senses in this juxtaposition a single-vision 
perception of the development of the Russian economy (if we do 
not achieve stabilization we will get "Ukrainization") and the 
same complete lack of substantiation and fanatical adherence to 
the "party line." "God save Russia from deviating again from the 
correct road," Fedorov ends his article. 
  How does Boris Fedorov intend to solve the problem of 
employment and raise the population's average income considering 
that 10 million people will have no job at all, and enterprises 
that have not gone bankrupt will nevertheless be unprofitable 
because of the low exchange rate of the dollar? What 
expenditures will then be required for maintenance of law 
enforcement organs? How does one bring inflation down 
considering that any tightening of the money supply produces 
only a cash crisis? Why, finally, can we today try to index 
people's savings "through noninflationary monetary means" while 
only yesterday this was rejected under a threat of 
hyperinflation? 
  There may be only one answer to all this: I am the minister 
of finance; these are not my problems. However, while such a 
position on the part of the minister of finance is completely 
consistent and beyond reproach, can Fedorov the politician--a 
man who should be aware of what results his departmental zeal 
will produce--formulate the issue this way? 
  "We should stop attempting to crossbreed a hedgehog and a 
grass snake--as is known, the product of it is barbed wire. The 
elections gave us a warning," wrote B.G. Fedorov. Fedorov is 
wrong. The elections did not give us a warning. The Russia's 
Choice radicals lost the elections. And they lost not to 
communo-fascists, as had been expected, but to a new force, 
capable of using social discontent to a highest degree. And if 
we consider that, Russia either needs to be crisscrossed either 
by a hedgehog-grass snake hybrid right now or we have to realize 
that the country on which we conduct experiments in fighting 
inflation by monetarist methods will fall into Zhirinovskiy's 
hands in 1996. And it will again end in hedgehogs and grass 
snakes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Nefedov, director of the </F>
All-Russia Consumer Market and Marketing Research Institute, by 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent Lyubov Volkova; place and date 
not given: "The More Money, the Lower the Standard of Living? 
Price Forecast for 1994"] 
  [Text] We are still inclined to visualize prices as 
something akin to vicious watchdogs, who suddenly lunge from 
around the corner and bite the passerby overcome with fear. And 
in fact this is the way it is. But actually, there should be 
nothing sudden in this. We have a right to know what to expect, 
what to be prepared for, in order to protect ourselves, our 
families, our business. 
  What sort of prices should the Russians expect in the 
coming year? Our correspondent posed this question to Vyacheslav 
Nefedov, director of the All-Russia Consumer Market and 
Marketing Research Institute. 
  [Volkova] Vyacheslav Konstantinovich, in January 1993 you 
warned that by the end of the year prices would rise on average 
10-fold. While politicians and economists close to the ruling 
circles maintained that prices would rise no more than three- to 
fivefold. Their forecast had proved wrong as early as in the 
summer. To what extent has the forecast of your institute's 
specialists turned correct? 
  [Nefedov] Our forecast had been right on the dot. Prices for 
foodstuffs and nonfood consumer items rose over the year on 
average by a factor of 9.7-10.5. Rye bread now costs 9.2 times 
more than a year ago; wheat bread--9.8 times more; beef--10.1 
times, and poultry--10.4 times more. There are also some 
products whose prices have shot outside the forecast range. 
Bologna prices rose almost 12-fold, milk--12.5-fold, and 
cabbage--15.6-fold. Onion prices increased more than 18-fold. 
  Not all food prices rose at this rate. Prices for rice rose 
only 3.5-fold, sugar--?.4-fold [copy unreadable], and domestic 
tea--?.?-fold [copy unreadable]. 
  [Volkova] We are being told that lately inflation amounted 
to 
?-? [copy unreadable] percent a week. Is this true? 
  [Nefedov] No. According to our data, prices for consumer 
goods rose in November by 23 percent, and in December, according 
to preliminary estimates--by 25 percent. The average price level 
was held down, however, by the seasonal factor; that is, prices 
for potatoes and some vegetables so far have remained level, as 
well as those for sugar, since its processing is still 
continuing. Prices for seasonal products will begin to rise, 
however, any time now. 
  [Volkova] What is your forecast for the year? 
  [Nefedov] We are still continuously threatened, first, by 
hyperinflation, and second, by a budget deficit. The mechanism 
that stimulates expansion of production still has not kicked in. 
The operational principle is: Raise prices and you may survive. 
Production of daily necessities continues to fall--by 10 percent 
in 1993. All in all, over the past two years production declined 
by 25 percent. And the decline is the same in the production of 
both foodstuffs and nonfood consumer goods. Only alcohol 
production remains high. 
  Overall, our forecast for 1994 is this: prices for consumer 
goods will continue to rise. By how much? It is very difficult 
to come up with specific figures, since we do not know what the 
government's fiscal and monetary policy will be. To be on the 
safe side, we offer two forecast scenarios. 
  First scenario. If a tough monetary policy is implemented 
(that is, the growth of the population's monetary income is 
restrained by imposing restrictions on enterprises in all 
economic sectors), prices will rise over the year fivefold on 
average. 
  Second scenario. We call it moderate. According to this 
scenario, prices will rise by a factor of 7.5-8. 
  [Volkova] This is considered moderate--like we had in 1993? 
  [Nefedov] No, 1993 went beyond moderate. By moderate we mean 
that some slack will be permitted with respect to unprofitable 
enterprises or even entire sectors under various pretexts. 
  In our opinion, as the year begins, the difference in the 
rate of price increases for foodstuffs and nonfood consumer 
goods will begin to increase. Prices for foodstuffs will be 
rising faster. Under the so-called moderate scenario, the 
population's standard of living declines faster. It is a 
paradox: people are paid more, but the standard of living falls. 
The gap between income and prices continues to grow. The demand 
for foodstuffs will rise, since many people will have to give up 
purchases of nonfood items. Bread prices will continue to rise, 
since for many it will became the main nutrition staple. The 
low-income group of the population already spends up to 80 
percent of its income on food; the medium-income--50-60 percent, 
and high-income group--25-30 percent. Stratification will become 
even more noticeable. 
  [Volkova] Well, this is unquestionably not a reassuring 
forecast. Why are you so certain that you are right? 
  [Nefedov] There are many amateurs now in the sphere of price 
forecasting. We are professionals. We have more than 30 years of 
experience in studying the domestic market. Our institute is 
engaged in consumer market research; we study how it forms and 
functions. In the past we were the head institute, with branches 
in all Union republics. Now instead of branches we have retained 
trade agents from among former branch associates, and currently 
receive and process information from Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, 
and so on. One has to know what is happening around Russia 
before attempting to forecast the situation here. 
  [Volkova] Where does your information go? 
  [Nefedov] We are under the Russian Federation Trade 
Committee 
and send all our reports there. 
  [Volkova] Does your information reach the politicians? 
  [Nefedov] It does not look that way.

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Nikitin, chairman of the board of the </F>
all-Russia joint-stock society Rosshelf, by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA 
correspondent Viktor Andriyanov; place and date not given: "A 
Smart Man Will Not Climb a Mountain: But a Wise One Will Descend 
to the Bottom of the Sea in Search of Light and Heat"] 
  [Text] Introducing our interlocutor: Boris 
Aleksandrovich Nikitin was born in 1940 in Saratov. He graduated 
from the Moscow Petroleum Institute and is a candidate of 
technical sciences. He worked for many years on Sakhalin and in 
[the Republic of] Komi as a worker, shop foreman, chief 
engineer, general director of major production associations, and 
a first deputy of the USSR minister of the oil industry. Member 
of the board of the RAO [all-Russia joint-stock society] 
Gazprom. 
  [Andriyanov] Boris Aleksandrovich, a year ago there was a 
wave of articles about Rosshelf in all the newspapers. Grandiose 
plans were outlined. And then--it was as if all the information 
were put under lock and key.... 
  [Nikitin] The Rosshelf joint-stock society was registered in 
May 1992. In 1993 we were granted licenses to develop two major 
deposits--Shtokman and Prirazlomnyy. We have accomplished a lot 
of preparation work, and only now can we tell about it. This 
interview to RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA is my first. 
  [Andriyanov] Thank you. So what has been done? 
  [Nikitin] Let us first look at the map, so that our readers 
will have a better understanding what we are talking about. The 
Shtokman deposit is located in the Barents Sea. The depth is 
considerable--more than 300 meters. Very difficult climatic 
conditions. We cannot apply the experience of development in the 
North Sea over here. The size of the gas deposit is enormous. It 
will have an impact on both the domestic and the foreign gas 
market. 
  We are currently putting together a technical and economic 
justification for the development of the Shtokman deposit. This 
will require completely new technology--for instance, platforms 
capable of working at a sea depth of more than 300 meters. 
  [Andriyanov] Can domestic industry handle it? 
  [Nikitin] Of course; that is the point--to make use of 
enterprises undergoing conversion. I think that the actual 
implementation of this project will begin in 1994. 
  [Andriyanov] Such large projects also require large 
investment.... 
  [Nikitin] Unfortunately, in 1993 we have been able to invest 
half the planned means. The gas industry, however, just like the 
oil and coal industries, cannot live without long-term planning. 
Old territories and deposits get depleted, mines die out. We 
need to work on new ones ahead of time. This is for the sake of 
the future of the country, the prospects for our children and 
grandchildren. 
  [Andriyanov] The mining and oil industries are currently 
losing more capacities than they put on line. 
  [Nikitin] Fortunately, this has not happened to the gas 
industry. The policy of the RAP Gazprom and its chairman, R. 
Vyakhirev, is oriented toward development of new major deposits. 
This is the precondition for normal work of the sector, and the 
entire industry. 
  One could do even more, but the current economic situation 
literally binds everyone, hand and foot. Still, Gazprom as a 
powerful, major firm is conducting a policy aimed at the future, 
and it takes into consideration what will happen in five, eight, 
10 years.... 
  [Andriyanov] Had we not had such a firm, had we not had a 
Unified Gas Supply System.... 
  [Nikitin] It would be very difficult, or perhaps even 
impossible, to finance the volume of development we are now 
doing on the Barents Sea shelf and at Yamal, which is mostly 
being worked by Nadymgazprom enterprises. We hope to increase 
investment next year. 
  [Andriyanov] Boris Aleksandrovich, speaking about the gas 
industry overall. This is probably the only sector that has 
avoided--let us knock on wood--the general decline. What is the 
secret? 
  [Nikitin] There is no secret. Fortuitous organizational 
changes were made when it was still the USSR Ministry of the Gas 
Industry. The sector has gradually adjusted to the real 
conditions emerging in Russia. In RAP Gazprom each stockholder 
has a stake in the final result of common activities. In short, 
what has emerged is a company capable of realistically competing 
not only in the Russian market, but in foreign markets as well. 
Gazprom found its niche in a market economy. 
  [Andriyanov] Why do you think this has not happened to the 
oil industry? 
  [Nikitin] By concentrating its means, Gazprom is able to 
support major projects. You tell me--what company could afford 
the development of Yamal or the shelf? 
  The crisis deals a blow first and foremost to projects 
requiring investment. To save them, major investment is needed. 
The oil industry currently does not have anyone to bring it 
under one roof. Formally, a concern apparently includes the 
entire chain--from extraction to the production of the final 
product; but in real terms, it has remained compartmentalized. 
And on top of that, constant delays in payments.... 
  [Andriyanov] We have seen the results of this in Nadyma.... 
  [Nikitin] Nevertheless, in such an explosive situation 
Gazprom has been able to maneuver resources in a timely manner 
and to take the necessary measures. 
  [Andriyanov] It appears that the social explosion in Nadyma 
was the result of the current economic policy. 
  [Nikitin] Policy is consistency. You see? A smart man will 
find a way out of a situation. A wise one will make it so that 
such a situation does not develop. 
  [Andriyanov] You mentioned the Prirazlomnyy deposit at the 
beginning of our conversation. Is this also at sea? 
  [Nikitin] Yes, it is located in the Pechora Sea, or, to be 
precise, in Pechora Bay. It was discovered two years ago. The 
first well produced oil; the second was not unsuccessful. 
  This year the Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, on a contract from 
Rosshelf, drilled Well No. 3. It produced a very good 
output--about 700 tonnes of oil a day. It is a rich deposit, and 
next year we plan to increase considerably the volume of 
operations there. 
  In addition, we are studying the shelf adjacent to Yamal; it 
is a very promising territory. The deposits there are estimated 
to contain 7-10 trillion cubic meters of gas. 
  Production decline as deposits get depleted is an objective 
occurrence. This disbalance cannot be corrected by resolutions. 
What is needed is new technologies, resource-saving, and most 
importantly, new deposits. 
  [Andriyanov] Thank you, Boris Aleksandrovich. RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA is prepared to introduce a permanent rubric on the topic 
of development of Yamal, the Shtokman and Prirazlomnyy deposits. 
  [Nikitin] This will help us all. And the people who work in 
these extreme conditions will be grateful to the newspaper for 
its attention to their efforts.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Chirkov: "And the Bank Just Nods and </F>
Keeps Doing Its Own Thing"] 
  [Text] There was a certain period of time when the main 
cause of delays in clearing were "bottlenecks" in integrated 
clearing centers of the Central Bank of Russia. Then they 
dissipated. Delays in payments still occur, however. But now for 
a different reason. Some banks shamelessly keep their clients' 
money in the turnover for their own profit. At the same time, 
they try to blame those same clearing centers or technical 
errors, or sometimes computer breakdowns. 
  We have already reported to our readers (RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 
17 December) how unceremoniously the commercial Narodnyy Bank 
treated its client, Moscow's Main Health Care Administration, in 
December, leaving thousands of health care workers in the 
capital city without salaries. 
  In January the situation repeated itself. And with the same 
deplorable outcome for hospital and outpatient clinic employees. 
On 4 January, on the eve of payday for doctors, medical 
attendants, and other health care employees, the Government of 
Moscow's Department of Finance instructed Narodnyy Bank to 
transfer from its account to the account of the city's Main 
Health Care Administration 17.62 billion rubles [R]. However, 
the money had not left Narodnyy Bank on the 4th, or even on the 
10th. Thus, over seven days this money, which the bank kept in 
circulation instead of carrying out the client's instruction, 
brought it--even at an interest rate of 210 percent (within 
Central Bank's official clearing rate)--R700 million tax-free 
profit. 
  Actually, of the payment order of its client--Moscow's 
Department of Finance--Narodnyy Bank did deign it appropriate to 
transfer....R1.7 billion. When the client complained 
indignantly, the bank simply dismissed it: "The machine probably 
failed to print an extra zero," they said. Meanwhile, though, 
the clever bank did collect almost R700 million in interest. 
  This is a good time to bring up another subject as well. 
Narodnyy is one of the few commercial banks which, with the 
snobbishness of the former State Bank's branch, loans out money 
from its clients' accounts. At the same time, however, it does 
not find it necessary to share the interest earned on these 
loans with the owners of this money. To this day, Narodnyy Bank 
has not entered a single kopek in interest on the so-called 
residual money into its clients' accounts. 
  In violation of all norms established by the Central Bank, 
Narodnyy Bank uses an impermissible great share of its clients' 
money for loans in the high-risk zone--to various limited 
liability partnerships and joint-stock companies. Which are 
unable to pay off these loans. And the bank, as we have seen, 
cannot make good on its liability to the clients. 
  The only thing that is hard to comprehend is why they get 
away with all these mercenary transgressions.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kokorin, economist with an automated </F>
production line plant, under the "A Viewpoint" rubric: "The War 
on Inflation: It Will Be Unsuccessful Until We Begin To Restore 
Production and Create a New Economic System With a Mechanism for 
Stabilizing Prices"] 
  [Text] Moscow--The cause of the economic collapse 
undoubtedly is in miscalculations of a conceptual nature: in an 
extremely simplistic, superficial, and one-sided understanding 
of economic processes and practical actions stemming from it. 
They are aimed at improving the financial system in the 
environment of falling production. 
  Inflation has been declared the number-one enemy. Of course, 
it is dangerous for the economy. However, it can only be a 
number-one problem in two circumstances. 
  First, when it is the only problem. When, for instance, the 
economic organism is already healing and all that is needed is 
to bring the temperature down. Second, when it represents the 
main cause of production decline. Obviously, the former is not 
the case. But neither is the latter. 
  Inflation becomes the main cause of a decline only when 
devaluation of money is happening so swiftly that money ceases 
fulfilling the function of an equivalent of goods; when barter 
develops or other countries' currencies take the place of the 
national currency. Thank goodness, we have not yet reached this 
point, although it is still possible. 
  Currently, however, the main cause of the production decline 
is not inflation, but rather fighting it by the method that the 
government is using. It tries in every way possible to restrict 
the money supply, to deprive the fire of inflation of 
combustible material, but forgetting that this material (money) 
is the prerequisite for commodity turnover and production. Hence 
the nonpayments crisis, or a crisis of commodity turnover, which 
gradually grows into a production decline. 
  Next. We are witnessing a transition from a state monopoly 
to 
a monopoly of private individuals and groups. But while the 
state as a public institution cannot pursue only the goals of 
financial gain, this is precisely the goal of individual- and 
group-based monopoly. Hence a sharp decline in income and demand 
on the part of the majority. Which also begets a nonpayments 
crisis, turning the latter into a classic crisis of 
overproduction and distribution. The government nevertheless 
refuses to restore the income and demand of the majority through 
indexing. 
  The main factor of the decline, and hence the number-one 
enemy, in our situation is not inflation--it is that the 
instruments that are used in fighting this ill are impermissible 
in a civilized economy. It is assumed that as soon as financial 
policy is truly tightened and subsidies dropped--in short, 
production is taken to the so-called "bottom" of solvent 
demand--inflation will immediately stop, and the long-awaited 
structural restructuring will begin. 
  These assumptions are far removed from reality, which 
actually has been confirmed by the practice of radical reforms. 
The point is that this so-called "bottom" of solvent demand is 
in itself not stationary, and is moving downward in the process 
of implementation of reforms. Or we may use this metaphor: as it 
goes down, the sinking ship of the Russian economy encounters an 
underwater current that pulls it into a deeper spot. 
  Of course, there is a limit. It will be reached when the 
surviving enterprises are able to reach an agreement among 
themselves on prices and salaries, but meanwhile the decline may 
be catastrophic. 
  The number-one problem now is to restore production and 
create a foundation of an economic system that will contain in 
it a mechanism of stabilizing prices. 
  We have to do everything to enable producers to reach an 
agreement on prices among themselves. We have to stop this very 
dangerous process of disintegration of large production 
associations, which form the foundation of the contract system 
that allows to stabilize prices. 
  Without cardinal changes in the economic mechanism, without 
solid and long-term agreements among producers, it is impossible 
to win a victory over inflation, and the "bottom" itself may 
turn out to be so deep that reaching it will exhaust even that 
great patience that our long-suffering people have been 
demonstrating to the entire world for almost two years.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Voloshchuk, deputy general director of </F>
the Federal Clearing Chamber of Gold Trade: "Waiting for a Gold 
Rush"] 
  [Text] Our society still has not quite appreciated 
the significance of the date of 27 September 1993. It is since 
that day that the state, for the first time in decades, began to 
transfer gold into private hands. It may be only the first small 
step: what is being put into circulation is not actual gold, but 
state obligations--the Gold Certificates of the Ministry of 
Finance--but this step already has been made. 
  With it, Russia and its weakened economy become 
full-fledged members of the world financial community. A year 
later, on 27 September 1994, citizens of Russia, banks, and 
firms will be able to possess the most real values in the world. 
Bars of 24K gold will become part of financial circulation, will 
help economic recovery, to get a handle on inflation. 
  Russia is far from the only country in the world where 
circulation of gold had been banned. Even in the United States 
in 1934 the law on gold bullion forbade ownership of gold bars; 
this ban was lifted only on 31 December 1974. A virtual boom in 
the gold market ensued. Now an average well-to-do American holds 
his assets not only in stocks and real estate, but also 
necessarily in gold bars. After all, the only thing that is 
safer than gold is gold that belongs to you and sits in an 
armored safe. The gold reserves kept in individual safe-deposit 
boxes in American banks could compete with the famous depository 
of state gold bullion in Fort Knox. 
  I think that a similar "gold rush" is awaiting us, too, 
magnified by the factor that after 70 years, Russia is more 
starved for gold than America. The current factors of political 
and economic instability also will have an impact. Gold is a 
crisis commodity; it tends to do well when in other spheres 
times are hard or a trend is developing toward the worsening of 
a situation. During the period of political and economic 
upheaval and growing inflation, the demand for gold has 
practically no "ceiling." 
  Therefore, we should expect that the Federal Clearing 
Chamber 
for Gold Trade is facing a heavy workload. And although the gold 
market in our country is just beginning to "warm up," judging by 
how fast the "temperature" is climbing up, we are not far from 
the "boiling point." 
  Currently the chamber has organized trading in Gold 
Certificates of the Ministry of Finance, as well as derivative 
rights to gold, which have been put into circulation by the 
owners of Gold Certificates. We hope that legislative changes 
will enable us to begin selling by the fall of 1994 24K gold 
bars and gold coins--this is a classic exchange commodity. The 
chamber is currently trading in two modes: the market of 
currently available commodities and the market of futures 
contracts. 
  In the current commodities market, there is buying and 
selling of deeds of ownership of parts of Gold Certificates, 
issued by the banks--the owners of full Gold Certificates. By 
its nature, it may be defined as an investor market, that is, 
depositors who want to protect their money from inflation--not 
only with respect to the ruble but also from inflation of 
seemingly hard currencies. It is no secret that over the past 
few months we have become witness and, what is even sadder, 
victim to a most paradoxical "dollar inflation." 
  Quantitatively, this is a market of small (from a few 
hundred 
to a few thousand rubles) to medium-sized (several tens of 
millions of rubles) depositors, who do not have the resources to 
purchase a whole Gold Certificate, which costs 150 million 
rubles [R]. In their composition, it is mostly commercial and 
state organizations, as well as individual citizens. 
  In the futures market, the actors are mainly speculators; 
the 
state of the market, which actually is not surprising, is set by 
"bulls." The trend of rising prices in the gold market is quite 
visible. For instance, in April 1993 at the London metals 
exchange a Troy ounce of gold cost $326; in November it already 
cost $375-$378. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY forecasts (No. 
215, 1993), within the next few months gold prices may rise to 
$410 or even $450 per Troy ounce. Thus, those who purchased last 
December standard futures contracts from the Federal Clearing 
Chamber for Gold Trade and sell them, for instance, in April 
will make a return up to 60 percent at the annual rate in 
foreign currency; keeping in mind that opening a position in the 
chamber requires posting an initial margin of 20 percent of the 
value of the contract, return on the invested capital may reach 
250-300 percent at the annual rate. And this is just for 
hedgers--active speculators, albeit with a certain degree of 
risk, may earn an even higher return. As to returns in rubles, 
this does not lend itself to calculation at all, just like the 
rate of inflation in our country. 
  The effectiveness and attractiveness of investing in a Gold 
Certificate may be graphically seen from this example: In 
jewelry stores, the price of 14K gold is R28,000 per gram, while 
the price of 24K gold in the Gold Certificate is today R18,000; 
thus, the gold of identical proof is three times less expensive 
in a Gold Certificate than in a jewelry store. Which means that 
for those who buy jewelry as a means of protecting their money 
from inflation, it is much more profitable to purchase shares in 
Gold Certificates. 
  As is known, the movement of the market is hard to forecast. 
For instance, J.P. Morgan, a great authority in the area of 
financial and stock exchange operations, when asked his opinion 
on the market moves, usually answered: "Expect fluctuations." I, 
however, am in a position to make the following forecast for the 
gold market: "Expect growth."

374-69-39; 374-75-43.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Novikov: "Interest-Free Credit--This, It </F>
Turns Out, Is Possible"] 
  [Text] The course of the Russian Government toward a strict 
credit-financial policy has forced producers to take stock. For 
the majority commercial credit today is a luxury but they must 
operate, and to pay off debts is also a luxury. At the regular 
meeting of the board of the Russian Federation Committee on 
Metallurgy a curious plan was proposed for distributing credit 
funds. It was conventionally called resource-target. In the 
opinion of experts, it will not save the branch from all of its 
problems but it will help many to complete mutual settlements. 
  The essence of the "scheme" is this. Credit is granted not 
to 
one enterprise, which pays off its debts at its own discretion, 
but to several. The debtors are arranged in a technological 
chain: for example, the pipe plant is in debt to the 
metallurgists, the metallurgists--to the miners, the miners--to 
the energy workers. This way the same credit passes through all 
links of the chain. As a result, both the sum of repayment and 
the credit rate are formed through all participants in the plan, 
and the last link receives money, say, a billion rubles, with 
minimal interest. 
  At the same time, as the funds move, it is as though each 
debtor in the chain gives credit to his creditor, thus there is 
a mutual settlement of debts. Moreover, the entire sum of credit 
reaches the final recipient in the complete and unaltered amount. 
  In the opinion of the chief of the administration for 
finance 
and accounting of the Russian Federation Committee on 
Metallurgy, Leonid Rakovskiy, such a system will make it 
possible to reduce the interest rate on credit, ease the burden 
of the borrowers, increase the repayment of credit and, as a 
result, it will draw commercial banks into cooperation with 
metallurgical enterprises. 
  Even today the Menatep Bank and the branch bank of 
Metallinvestbank are prepared to work according to this plan. 
True, the banks will carefully verify the solvency of the 
clients, and the credit, obviously, will be received only by 
profitable enterprises. In the words of the chairman of the 
Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy, Serafim Afonin, even 
such a clever system will not help an obvious outsider.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Who Is Being Warmed by Petrorubles </F>
If They Are Not Going to the Petroleum Workers Who Are in Debt 
up to Their Ears?"] 
  [Text] Although the "real" freezing weather has not hit 
yet, the fuel supply for the national economy is causing a great 
deal of uneasiness. The supplies have "melted away" considerably 
more rapidly and in larger volumes than was anticipated, 
according to calculations of specialists. And it was not 
possible to restore them fully by January. 
  Nonetheless, as they think in the Ministry of Fuel and 
Energy 
of Russia, through the combined efforts of miners and operations 
workers the situation is stabilizing to a certain degree. Active 
work is being done to conclude agreements for the delivery of 
fuel during the first quarter and throughout the year as a whole. 
  At the same time the administrations of many regions are 
trying to solve these problems by old administrative-economic 
methods, particularly by prohibiting the shipment of petroleum 
products outside their territories and also by exporting fuel 
that was intended, according to paid agreements, for other 
regions of the country. And this is being done under the guise 
of concern for "their own" residents and enterprises. 
  The roots of this practice lie, apparently, in the recent 
past when the state granted all regions special-purpose credit 
for purchasing fuel and preparing for winter. But at that time, 
obviously, they counted on spending it more advantageously for 
other purposes, above all for things that produce a rapid return 
on capital and considerable profit. Or they simply left the 
matter to its own accord, hoping that the government would not 
allow the cities and large industrial enterprises to freeze. 
According to figures of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, a 
total of more than 200 billion rubles [R] was not used to pay 
for fuel--about 40 percent of the credit allotted. 
  Thus according to information from the Komineft Joint-Stock 
Company, of the R8 billion in loans allotted in November of last 
year to the government of the Republic of Komi to settle 
accounts with suppliers of petroleum products and coal and for 
additional purchases of energy resources, the republic petroleum 
industry has not yet received a single ruble. Nobody knows where 
and to whom this money went. And petroleum workers of the region 
are now on the verge of financial ruin: they have no money 
either for wages or for settling accounts with the suppliers or 
for payments into the budget. In the final analysis, all this 
threatens to shut down wells, suspend deliveries of oil for 
processing, and orient the enterprises toward selling it to 
commercial structures. 
  And what is especially alarming is that such a situation is 
not an exception, the ITAR-TASS correspondent emphasizes, but 
rather the rule. The consumers prefer not to pay for energy 
resources and, taking advantage of the fact that the enterprises 
cannot stop the continuous process of extraction, they are 
forced to turn over their products practically free of charge. 
In the opinion of the leaders of the fuel and energy complex, in 
such a situation it is necessary to use not so much economic 
methods but methods of state pressure on the structures that are 
impeding the arrangement of normal market relations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "They Go to the Trade Union for Help. </F>
They Bring Their Vouchers Here Too..."] 
  [Text] At the end of last year RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA (see the 
issue for 28 December) reported to its readers on the check 
investment fund of workers of Profsolidarnost. Most frequently 
such funds advertise themselves in loud and intriguing ways: "We 
will turn your voucher into gold!" etc. And the "details" that 
interest the voucher holders are simply left out. The calling 
card of Profsolidarnost, which was founded by the largest branch 
trade unions of Russia, was drawn up, it seemed, quite 
carefully. Nonetheless the Moscow staff headquarters of the 
fund, which is located in the building of the Council of the 
FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] on 
Lenin Avenue, and its representative offices, which are in 
republic, kray, oblast, city, and rayon trade union committees, 
and also RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA are receiving phone calls and letters 
from people requesting that various details be clarified, that 
they discuss in greater detail why Profsolidarnost can so 
confidently guarantee them high dividends. The floor is turned 
over to the vice president for public relations of the 
joint-stock company of managers of AKOM, Andrey Stolyarov: 
  "I will not deny that the growing interest of RABOCHAYA 
TRIBUNA readers in our fund is gratifying. We are gaining more 
and more stockholders. But it is also quite natural for the 
people to want to learn more about the people to whom they have 
decided to entrust their vouchers. Noisy scandals over funds 
that promised mountains of gold yesterday and today have 
suddenly taken a dive or have disappeared completely are a 
lesson to many: be careful...we must never disappoint the 
expectations of the people or even promise more than we can give 
them. You will agree that this would be a terrible blow to the 
largest and most respected associations of workers--the trade 
unions." 
  And so we have the trade unions behind us. They are the ones 
whose direct duty it is to defend the interests of the 
workers--our first guarantors. Where does almost any investment 
fund begin? With the creation of a network of its representative 
offices and points for receiving vouchers and selling shares. 
And on this they spend millions and millions of rubles that have 
been taken out of the pockets of the shareholders. But we 
essentially already have such a network. It is the trade union 
structures of the most diverse levels, which are capable of 
simultaneously both monitoring the activity of the fund and 
appreciably influencing it. If the "rank-and-file" shareholder 
has certain doubts or questions he is welcome to come to his 
home trade union committee where he knows everyone and they know 
him. 
  The authorized capital of Profsolidarnost is more than 50 
billion rubles. Obviously a large fund. And in this connection 
the misgivings expressed by certain people are justified: Will 
the founders not start investing the multitude of vouchers they 
have gathered "just any old where"? As long as they dispose of 
them?...no, nothing like that happens here nor will it happen. 
Some are better and some are worse, and the trade unions know 
precisely which is which, in which branches and in which 
enterprises things are proceeding well today and where they are 
having nothing but trouble. Because the controller of the fund 
of the joint-stock company of managers AKOM has already 
managed--with real support from the trade unions--to set up an 
effective system of investments. In particular, we have arranged 
business contacts with a number of profitable and promising 
enterprises of the extraction and processing 
branches--petroleum, timber, chemical, gold-ore, diamond...and, 
believe me, these enterprises will survive in any "weather."

<F P=106> [Text of "State Program for the Privatization of State and </F>
Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The State Program for the Privatization of State and 
Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation (hereinafter 
referred to as the Program) is a federal program in the field of 
the economic and social development of the Russian Federation 
elaborated in accordance with the requirements of the Russian 
Federation Law "On the Privatization of State and Municipal 
Enterprises in the Russian Federation" taking account of the 
experience and results of privatization conducted in 1992-1993. 
  The program sets the objectives, targets, priorities, 
limitations, and procedures for privatization. 
  Broad interpretation of the restrictions on privatization 
indicated in the Program, and also in local privatization 
programs, is not permitted. 
  The main objectives of the Program are: 
  --the formation of a broad stratum of private property 
owners 
as the economic basis of market relations; 
  --the involvement in the privatization process of the 
broadest possible strata of the population through the sale of 
privatizable state and municipal property for privatization 
checks at specialized check auctions prior to 1 July 1994 and 
for money at auctions after 1 July 1994; 
  --the completion of privatization involving the use of 
privatization checks; 
  --the completion of the privatization of most "small-scale 
privatization" facilities and the acceleration on this basis of 
the development of the trade and services sphere; 
  --the completion in the main of the privatization of large 
and medium-sized enterprises in industry and construction and 
the improvement of the performance of enterprises and the 
national economy as a whole on the basis of the implementation 
of structural restructuring of the economy, the development of 
post-privatization support for enterprises, the creation of a 
competitive environment, and the development of the capital 
market; 
  --the attraction of investment, including foreign 
investment, 
into production; 
  --assistance in the implementation of measures to provide 
social support for the population, including the protection of 
the rights of private property owners (stockholders). 
  Facilities and enterprises in federal, state, and municipal 
ownership are divided into the following groups on the basis of 
their suitability for privatization: 
  --facilities and enterprises in federal ownership whose 
privatization is prohibited; 
  --facilities and enterprises in federal ownership whose 
privatization is effected by Russian Federation Government 
decision; 
  --facilities and enterprises whose privatization is effected 
by decision of the Russian Federation State Committee for the 
Management of State Property (hereinafter referred to as the 
Russian Goskomimushchestvo) taking account of the opinion of 
sector ministries; 
  --facilities and enterprises in state (municipal) ownership 
whose privatization is effected in accordance with the Program 
by decision of organs of state power and administration of the 
republics within the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the 
autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and the cities of Moscow 
and St. Petersburg and with local privatization programs; 
  facilities and enterprises in federal or state (municipal) 
ownership subject to compulsory privatization. 
  The privatization of facilities and enterprises in federal 
or 
state (municipal) ownership which are not included in the 
targets and are not subject to restrictions on privatization is 
effected on the on the basis of decisions by territorial 
property management committees or of privatization applications 
submitted by any persons. 
  In the event that an application for the privatization of an 
enterprise is submitted by the labor collective or by any 
individual or corporate third party acknowledged as the 
purchaser in the privatization process, the appropriate property 
management committee is obligated to adopt a decision on the 
privatization of the enterprise and must mandatorily inform the 
applicant of the decision adopted. 
  The privatization of state and municipal educational 
establishments is governed by the relevant legislation. 
  Pending the adoption of a law or other Russian Federation 
legislative act, health-care institutions and enterprises, and 
also pharmacies, are privatized in accordance with a special 
procedure to be approved by the Russian Federation Government. 
  Questions relating to the privatization of facilities in the 
ownership of republics within the Russian Federation, krays, 
oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg and also of facilities in 
municipal ownership are decided by the components of the Russian 
Federation on the basis of Russian Federation privatization 
legislation, including the features, restrictions, and 
principles defined by the present Program. 
  Fulfillment of the requirements laid down by the Program is 
mandatory for federal organs of administration; organs of state 
power and administration of the republics within the Russian 
Federation, krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous 
okrugs, and the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg; and organs 
of local self-government.

  Decisions on the privatization of enterprises indicated in 
Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the Program are adopted on the basis of 
Russian Federation laws and enactments of the Russian Federation 
president, respectively by the Russian Federation Government and 
the Russian Goskomimushchestvo and its territorial organs. 
  Privatization documents for enterprises in federal ownership 
are submitted to a property management committee with the status 
of a territorial agency of the Russian Goskomimushchestvo; the 
said committee must, within three days, send the documents: 
  --if the enterprise is included in Section 2.2 of the 
Program 
-- to the Russian Goskomimushchestvo, with copies to the 
relevant sector ministry, state committee, committee, and 
financial organ; 
  --if the enterprise is included in Section 2.3 of the 
Program 
-- to the financial organ for the locality in which the

Support for New Economic Structures or its territorial 
administration, for facilities requiring their agreement; their 
findings are sent within three weeks to the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo (if the enterprise is included in Section 2.2 
of the Program) or its territorial agency (if the enterprise is 
included in Section 2.3 of the Program). 
  Within two weeks of receiving the documents, sector 
ministries, state committees, and committees submit their 
findings on the expediency of privatization of facilities in 
federal ownership to the organ which is to adopt the decision on 
privatization. 
  For facilities and enterprises indicated in Section 2.3 of 
the Program, in the light of the findings of the relevant 
ministry, the decision on privatization is made by the leader of 
the territorial agency of the Russian Goskomimushchestva within 
one month of the documents being sent to the sector ministries 
and departments. 
  At the expiry of the prescribed period in which ministries, 
state committees, and committees can present conclusions on the 
impossibility of privatization, the leader of the territorial 
agency of the Russian Goskomimushchestvo must adopt a decision 
on privatization. 
  If the territorial agency refuses to carry out privatization 
or if there are disagreements over privatization issues between 
ministries and territorial agencies regarding the facilities and 
enterprises indicated in Section 2.3 of the Program, the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo is entitled itself to examine the possibility 
of privatizing them in the light of the opinion of sector 
ministries and departments. 
  Regarding the facilities and enterprises indicated in 
Section 
2.2 of the Program, the Russian Goskomimushchestvo submits draft 
directives to the Russian Federation Government within 15 days 
of receiving documents from the territorial agency and the 
conclusions of ministries and departments. 
  Within 10 days (or for military-industrial complex 
enterprises within one month) of receipt the Russian Federation 
Government examines the draft directives and adopts appropriate 
decisions. 
  If within the indicated period the Russian Federation 
Government has not adopted any decisions according to the 
prescribed procedure, the Russian Goskomimushchestvo within one 
month of the expiry of the period for the examination of 
documents by the Russian Federation Government adopts a decision 
on the possibility of privatization and the procedure for 
carrying it out. If the Russian Federation Government adopts 
a negative decision the Russian Goskomimushchestvo within the 
same period sends a copy of the Russian Federation Government 
directive to the relevant territorial agency. 
  In considering the question of the privatization of the 
enterprises indicated in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 the Russian 
Federation Government, the Russian Goskomimushchestvo, and the 
latter's territorial agencies may adopt the following decisions: 
  1. To prohibit privatization. In this case one of the 
following decisions must be adopted: to convert the enterprise

Russian Federation president's Edict No. 721 of 1 July 1992 "On 
Organizational Measures To Reorganize State Enterprises and 
Voluntary Associations of State Enterprises ss Joint-Stock 
Companies," retaining 100 percent of the shares in state 
ownership, or to convert the enterprise into a state institution 
financed from state sources. 
  2. To establish restrictions on privatization exclusively in 
the form of the retention of blocks of ordinary (voting) shares 
(51 percent, 38 percent, or 25.5 percent) in federal ownership 
or in the form of the issue of a "golden share." 
  3. To permit privatization without any restrictions. In 
converting into joint-stock companies the enterprises indicated 
in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, the Russian Federation Government and 
the Russian Goskomimushchestvo determine the aims, terms, and 
periods of the retention of blocks of shares a "golden share" in 
federal ownership in the light of the opinion of sector 
ministries, departments, and organs of state management of 
Russian Federation components. 
  Decisions on retaining blocks of shares in federal ownership

state needs and export-import operations in support of

indicated sectors retained in federal ownership for a period of 
up to three years consists of ordinary shares which remain in 
the possession of the relevant property management committee 
until the expiry of the period indicated in the privatization 
plan or the adoption of a decision on early sale. 
  A decision to retain a block of shares consisting of 51 
percent of ordinary (voting) shares can be made only on the 
basis of an edict of the Russian Federation president; a 
decision on a block consisting of 38 percent of ordinary 
(voting) shares can be made only by the Russian Federation 
Government. In converting into joint-stock companies 
enterprises in which a controlling interest is retained in 
federal ownership for a period of up to three years the Russian 
Federation Government and the Russian Goskomimushchestvo are 
entitled, in accordance with the powers laid down by the State 
Program for the Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises 
in the Russian Federation, to instruct such persons as they may 
decide, including officials of organs of state administration at 
the submission of the relevant ministries, departments, and 
regions, to represent on a contract basis the state's interests 
on the board of directors of the joint-stock company. Officials 
of organs of state administration appointed under the 
aforementioned procedure to the boards of directors of 
joint-stock companies carry out their activities on an unpaid 
basis. 
  In converting into joint-stock companies enterprises 
indicated in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the Program the Russian 
Federation Government or the Russian Goskomimushchestvo in the 
light of proposals from ministries and departments can adopt a 
decision on the issue of a "golden share" for a period of up to 
three years during the share flotation. 
  The simultaneous retention in state ownership of a "golden 
share" and other blocks of shares is not permitted. 
  If a "golden share" is issued concessions are granted to the 
labor collective according to the procedure laid down by the 
Program. 
  The Russian Federation Government and the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo are entitled to adopt a decision to replace 
blocks of shares retained in federal ownership by a "golden 
share."

channeled entirely into funding social, cultural, and everyday 
facilities transferred as part of the process of converting the 
enterprise into a joint-stock company to the books sheet of 
local organs of power and remaining on the enterprise's books 
and used for the original purpose, or, if there are no such 
facilities, are channeled into the federal budget under the 
procedure envisaged by a statute elaborated by the Russian 
Ministry of Finance in coordination with the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo. 
  This procedure for the allocation of dividends may be 
changed 
only by decision of the Russian Federation Government.

restrictions apply according to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the 
Program, the adoption of decisions to retain blocks of shares in

the state's interests on the boards of directors of joint-stock 
companies are carried out in accordance with the statute 
elaborated by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo and approved by the 
Russian Federation Government. 
  The fact that an enterprise has a defense order not 
exceeding 
30 percent of the total volume of output sold by the enterprise, 
and also duties regarding mobilization preparation, the 
protection of state secrets, and the ensuring of safe working is 
no grounds for the retention of any blocks of shares in federal 
ownership when it is converted into a joint-stock company.

ownership under Section 2.3 of the Program must be sold no later 
than four months from the time of registration of the

are located, which constitute immovable property, and also 
nonresidential premises in apartment blocks, including built-in 
and built-on premises, is established according to the procedure 
defined by Article 17 of the Russian Federation Law "On the 
Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian 
Federation." Auction and competitive sale is permitted only 
regarding unoccupied or unused facilities that are not part of 
the housing stock. 
  The proceeds from the sale of leased facilities that are not 
part of the housing stock are allocated in accordance with the 
norms envisaged by the Program. 
<H3>  3. Calculated Privatization Indicators for Organs of State 
Power and Administration </H3>
  3.1. In the light of the aims of privatization and also of 
the structure and scale of privatization demand at the 
territorial and sector levels, the Russian Goskomimushchestvo 
sets for republics within the Russian Federation, krays, 
oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg calculated targets for the 
flotation and privatization of enterprises in the form of a 
cumulative total and for the realization of privatization 
checks, these targets forming an integral part of the Program. 
  The calculated indicators are conveyed to the regions within 
one month of the adoption of the Program and may be clarified 
quarterly by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo. 
  3.2. On the basis of the targets the property management 
committees of republics within the Russian Federation, krays, 
oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg elaborate local 
privatization programs and forecast receipts of privatization 
checks and money as a result of privatization. The local 
privatization programs approved by the relevant organs of power 
are submitted to the Russian Goskomimushchestvo and the Russian 
Federal Property Fund. 
<H3>  4. The Formation and Distribution of the Proceeds of 
Privatization </H3>
  4.1. By the funds received as a result of privatization is 
meant the entire proceeds in money and privatization checks from 
the sale of privatized facilities and the revenue received in 
the privatization process in the form of registration fees, 
guarantees, and other revenue. 
  The dividends from shares belonging to the state and rent 
payments for the leasing of state and municipal property are not 
included in the funds from privatization and are paid into the 
corresponding budget minus bank charges (except for instances 
indicated in Sections 2.3 and 6 of the Program). 
  4.2. The total revenue from privatization in 1994 is 
estimated at R0.7 trillion in privatization checks and R0.8 
trillion in cash. 
  The dividends on shares retained in federal and state 
ownership in 1994 are estimated at R200 billion. 
  4.3. The funds from privatization, including privatization 
checks, are distributed according to normatives in conformity 
with Appendix No. 1 to the Program in the following order: With 
labor collectives, money settlements are made with privatization 
organs and local budgets and payments are made into the Federal 
Enterprise Support Fund; privatization checks count toward the 
funds paid into the Russian Federation republic budget and the 
corresponding budgets of republics within the Russian 
Federation, krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous 
okrugs, and the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
  If blocks of shares are retained in state ownership, the 
remainder [of the shares] is treated as 100 percent during the 
distribution of the funds received from privatization. 
  4.4. The Russian Federation Government is entitled to adjust 
the indicators and normatives for the distribution of the funds 
received from privatization in the light of the state of the 
Russian Federation's financial system, conditions in the 
property market, and proposals from the relevant privatization 
organs. 
  4.5. The funds received from privatization are not liable to 
taxation. 
  4.6. The activities of property management committees and 
property funds at all levels are not taxed, including deals for 
other sales of state and municipal property. 
  4.7. The funds received from privatization are paid into 
budgets at the corresponding levels according to the established 
normatives and are channeled exclusively: 
  --into maintaining social, cultural, and everyday 
facilities, 
including those that do not form part of the property of a 
joint-stock company and those that are transferred into the 
charge of local organs of power during the privatization process; 
  --into financing measures for the post-privatization support 
of enterprises. 
  4.8. In cities under rayon jurisdiction and in cities with 
administrative-territorial divisions (rayons, settlements), the 
funds from privatization channeled into local budgets can, at 
the petition of the heads of administration of cities and urban 
rayons (settlements) and by decision of the heads of 
administration of cities and rayons during the sale of municipal 
property or [by decision] of the organs of state power of 
Russian Federation components during the sale of state property, 
be channeled by the sellers into the budgets of these 
administrative-territorial formations in order to fund the 
maintenance of social, cultural, and everyday facilities 
transferred to municipal ownership during the privatization of 
enterprises. 
  4.9. The Russian Ministry of Finance Control and Auditing 
Administration together with the Russian Goskomimushchestvo 
monitors the timeliness and correctness of privatization organs' 
payments to budgets at various levels. 
<H3>  5. Methods of Privatization and Concessions Granted During 
Privatization </H3>
  The specific method of privatizing an enterprise is 
determined by the privatization working commission or the 
privatization commission of the relevant property management 
committee in accordance with the Russian Federation Law "On the 
Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian 
Federation," the Russian Federation president's Edict No. 721 of 
1 July 1992 "On Organizational Measures To Convert State 
Enterprises and Voluntary Associations of State Enterprises Into 
Joint-Stock Companies," the state and local privatization 
programs, and normative acts not contravening the present 
Program. 
  It is laid down that amendments and additions to Section 2 
of 
the privatization plan can be made by the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo, with mandatory notification of the relevant 
financial organs and enterprises undergoing privatization. It is 
not permitted to make amendments and additions to the 
privatization plan after publication of the announcement of the 
sale of a privatized facility. 
  5.1. All state (municipal) enterprises are divided into two 
groups in relation to the privatization methods they employ: 
  --the first group includes small enterprises with fixed 
capital of a book value as of 1 January 1992 of no more than R1 
million which are subject to sale by auction, competitive 
tender, and investment competition. The labor collectives of 
these enterprises are entitled, by a qualified majority of 
two-thirds of the votes of all members (at a general meeting or 
else confirmed by sheets of signatures), to choose the method of 
sale: at auction or by investment competitions without 
restriction on the participants. This decision is binding on the 
relevant property management committees; 
  --the second group includes all other enterprises, which may 
be privatized by any method envisaged in Point 5.2 of the 
Program. 
  In the event of a failure to fulfill the requirements of the 
present Program, the Russian Federation president's Edicts No. 
721 of 1 July 1992 and No. 1228 of 14 October 1992 "On the Sale 
for Privatization Checks of Housing Stock, Parcels of Land, and 
Municipal Property," or Decree No. 757 of the Russian Federation 
Council of Ministers-Government dated 10 August 1993 "On the 
Implementation of Additional Measures To Protect the Right of 
Russian Citizens To Take Part in Privatization," property 
management committees (ministries and departments) are entitled 
under the established procedure to decide to dissolve contracts 
concluded earlier with enterprise leaders or, in the absence of 
contracts, to dismiss them from their posts. In this case the 
conversion of enterprises into joint-stock companies takes place 
on the initiative of the relevant property management committee 
under the established procedure, with members of their labor 
collectives being granted concessions only under the first 
option (Point 5.3.1) in the Program. 
  5.2. Under the procedure established by the Program the use 
of the following privatization methods is envisaged: 
  --the sale of shares in open-type joint-stock companies 
created during the privatization process; 
  --the sale of enterprises that are not joint-stock companies 
at auctions; 
  --the sale of enterprises that are not joint-stock companies 
by commercial tender (including tenders with restrictions on 
participants); 
  --the sale of blocks of shares in joint-stock companies by 
investment competition; 
  --the sale of the property (assets) of functioning 
enterprises, enterprises in the process of being liquidated, and 
liquidated enterprises, and also of facilities whose 
construction is unfinished, at auctions and by tender; 
  --the purchase of leased property; the sale of enterprises 
to 
partnerships created in accordance with the additional 
concessions envisaged by Point 5.16; 
  --the sale of stakes (holdings, shares) in state or 
municipal 
ownership by auction and commercial tender, including tenders 
with restrictions on the participants. 
<H3>  5.3. The Sale of Shares in an Open-Type Joint-Stock Company 
Created in the Process of Privatizations </H3>
<H3>  A. Concessions to Members of the Labor Collective in 
Converting a State (Municipal) Enterprise Into an Open-Type 
Joint-Stock Company </H3>

  5.3.1. During the sale (free transfer) of shares in 
open-type 
joint-stock companies created via the conversion of state and 
municipal enterprises (including those previously converted into 
closed-type joint-stock companies), the enterprise labor 
collective decides to apply one of the options for granting 
concessions to the labor collective of a privatized enterprise 
envisaged by the Program, and these concessions also extend to: 
  --workers for whom the enterprise in question is their main 
workplace; former workers who have at least 10 years' record 
of work at the privatized enterprise for men and at least 7 
years six months' for women and who left at their own request 
(including by virtue of transfer to other work), as a result of 
downsizing or staff reductions, and also during the 
reorganization of enterprises; 
  --persons having the right under Russian Federation 
legislation to return to their former job at the enterprise, 
including persons drafted into military service while working at 
a state (municipal) enterprise before its conversion into a 
joint-stock company, provided that they return to their former 
job within three months of demobilization; 
  --pensioners who made their pension arrangements and retired 
at the enterprise in question; 
  --persons dismissed from the enterprise as a result of 
downsizing or staff reductions after 1 January 1992 and 
registered as unemployed; 
  -workers of these enterprises who retired on an invalidity 
pension as a result of on-the-job injury or occupational disease; 
  --family members who are the heirs of workers at the 
enterprise who died at the given production facility. 
  All persons to whom the concessions in question apply are 
included in the number of personnel on equal terms with the 
workers for whom the enterprise is the main workplace. 
<H6>  Option 1 </H6>
  All members of the labor collective of the privatized 
enterprise and persons of equivalent status and the right to 
concessions: 
  --receive a one-time free transfer of personalized 
privileged 
(nonvoting) shares making up 25 percent of the authorized 
capital but totaling no more than 20 times the legally 
established minimum wage per worker; 
  ordinary shares making up to 10 percent of the authorized 
capital but totaling no more than six times the legally 
established minimum wage per worker are sold by restricted 
subscription to members of the labor collective at 30 percent 
below face value with payment by installments over up to three 
months; the size of the initial installment cannot be less than 
50 percent of the face value of the shares. 
  The administration of the privatized enterprise -- the 
leader, his deputy, the chief engineer, the chief accountant, 
the leader of a separate subsidiary structural component or 
subsidiary -- on the basis of the terms of the contracts 
concluded with them is granted the right to purchase at face 
value ordinary shares worth a total of up to 5 percent of the 
authorized capital, but no more than 2,000-times the minimum 
wage established by Russian Federation legislation per person. 
  At enterprises with an average staff of over 10,000 people 
and with separate subsidiary structural components, shops, and 
sections, and also in cases where a privatization plan envisages 
the restructuring of an enterprise and the formation of 
subsidiary enterprises, the list of administration officials 
with the right to this concession may be extended by decision of 
the labor collective. 
<H6>  Option 2 </H6>
  All members of the labor collective of the enterprise being 
privatized and persons of equal status who are entitled to 
concessions are given the right to acquire ordinary (voting) 
shares representing up to 51 percent of the authorized capital. 
  In this event: 
  --there is no free transfer or sale of shares on 
concessionary terms; 
  --the selling price of shares is determined according to the 
Statute on Restricted Subscriptions ratified by the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo. 
<H6>  Option 3 </H6>
  If a group of enterprise workers or any individual or 
corporate entity, recognized as purchasers under Article 9 of 
the Russian Federation Law "On the Privatization of State and 
Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation," undertakes 
responsibility for fulfilling the enterprise's privatization 
plans and preventing its bankruptcy and acquires the consent of 
the labor collective's general meeting to conclude the 
appropriate contract whose term cannot exceed one year (without 
the right to extend it), the members of this group are given the 
right to acquire 30 percent of the authorized capital in the 
form of ordinary shares in the enterprises at nominal value when 
the aforementioned term has expired and the conditions of the 
aforementioned contract have been fulfilled. 
  The procedure for concluding the shares acquisition contract 
with the group of workers is prescribed by the statute approved 
by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo. 
  While the contract is in force, the aforementioned group is 
given the right to vote on behalf of all shares held by the 
relevant property fund. 
  The privatization plan incorporates the conditions of the 
contract, whose conclusion with the aforementioned group of 
joint-stock company founders is mandatory. The contract defines 
the group members' obligations and the limit of their material 
liability guaranteed by privately-owned property (pledged by way 
of a mortgage) amounting to at least 200 times the minimum wage 
prescribed by Russian Federation legislation at the time the 
mortgage is pledged per group member. 
  Under this option, ordinary shares are sold to all 
enterprise 
workers (including the group members) to a total value of 20 
percent of the authorized capital but not in excess of 20 times 
the minimum wage prescribed by Russian Federation legislation 
per worker, with a 30-percent discount on the face value and a 
three-month deferment of payment. Furthermore, the amount of the 
first instalment cannot be less than 25 percent of the share's 
face value. 
  In the event of the group failing to fulfill the contract 
conditions, the shares due to be sold to this group's members 
are sold to the population at check auctions (at money auctions 
after 1 July 1994). 
  The procedure for the allocation of shares to be transferred 
without payment (when Option 1 is chosen) is determined by a 
general meeting (conference) of the labor collective by a simple 
majority of votes. 
  The sale of shares to labor collective members and persons 
of 
equal status within the limits of the concessions prescribed by 
this Program is effected by way of restricted subscription in 
accordance with the statute approved by the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo. 
  Property management committees are permitted to extend to 
three months the deadline for holding restricted subscriptions 
for shares among enterprise workers on the basis of specific 
enterprises' specific production activity. The sale of shares 
transferred to property funds can be effected prior to the 
conclusion of the restricted subscription. 
  The decision on the choice of option of concessions 
prescribed by the Program is adopted by a general meeting of the 
labor collective or is certified by a list of its members' 
signatures. The decision is deemed adopted if at least 
two-thirds of the total number of enterprise workers have voted 
(signed) in favor of it. In the absence of such a decision, 
concessions are granted according to Option 1. 
  The workers of enterprises belonging to the same 
technological complex as the enterprise being privatized, 
regardless of the concessions option which has been chosen by 
decision of the labor collective, are given the right to 
participate in the restricted subscription to shares held among 
workers of the enterprise being privatized on the same 
conditions. 
  5.3.2. Any shares acquired or received free by citizens or 
corporate entities can be sold by the owner without any 
restrictions. The imposition of restrictions is prohibited. 
  5.3.3. The determination of the initial price of state 
(municipal) enterprises when being sold at auction or via 
commercial (noncommercial) or investment tender is effected 
according to the procedure prescribed by the Interim 
Methodological Recommendations for Estimating the Value of 
Facilities Being Privatized, ratified by Edict No. 66 of the 
Russian Federation president of 29 January 1992 "On Accelerating 
the Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises," with due 
consideration for the amendments introduced by Directive No. 763 
of the Russian Goskomimushchestvo of 13 November 1993 "On Some 
Questions Concerning the Application of the Interim 
Methodological Recommendations for Estimating the Value of 
Facilities Being Privatized." 
  The valuation of property is effected on the basis of 
balance 
sheet figures for the accounting quarter preceding the 
computation of the valuation. The value of fixed assets 
represented by incomplete construction work and uninstalled 
equipment is determined in the valuation document without taking 
into account the results of the revaluation of fixed assets 
conducted in accordance with Decree No. 595 of the Russian 
Federation Government of 14 August 1992 "On the Revaluation of 
Fixed Assets (Capital) in the Russian Federation" or any 
subsequent revaluation of fixed assets. 
  The actual profit earned by enterprises in 1993-1994 is not 
a 
source for forming the enterprise workers' privatization fund 
and is not excluded from the value of property when determining 
the enterprise's initial price. 
  5.3.4. When state (municipal) enterprises are being 
converted 
into open-type joint-stock companies, the amount of authorized 
capital is determined on the basis of balance sheet figures as 
at 1 July 1992 without taking into account the results of the 
revaluation of fixed assets conducted in accordance with Decree 
No. 595 of the Russian Federation Government of 14 August 1992 
"On the Revaluation of Fixed Assets (Capital) in the Russian 
Federation" or any subsequent revaluation of fixed assets, or 
any foreign currency items appearing on the balance sheet. 
  In this event the following are applied in order to 
determine 
the option of concessions offered to labor collective members: 
  --the minimum wage as at 1 July 1992 (900 rubles [R]); 
  --the average numerical strength of the enterprise's work 
force according to figures reported for the first six months of 
1992. 
  All changes in the composition and value of property since 1 
July 1992 are treated as changes to the composition and value of 
property owned by the joint-stock company. 
  The actual profit earned by enterprises in 1993-1994 is not 
a 
source for forming the enterprise workers' privatization fund 
and is not excluded from the value of property when determining 
the amount of authorized capital. 
  5.3.5. The amount of authorized capital of joint-stock 
companies created via the conversion of state (municipal) 
enterprises founded (registered) since 1 July 1992 is determined 
on the basis of balance sheet figures for the accounting quarter 
preceding the valuation. 
  When determining the amount of authorized capital, the value 
of fixed assets represented by incomplete construction work and 
uninstalled equipment is determined in the valuation document 
without taking into account the results of the revaluation of 
fixed assets conducted in accordance with Decree No. 595 of the 
Russian Federation Government of 14 August 1992 "On the 
Revaluation of Fixed Assets (Capital) in the Russian Federation" 
or any subsequent revaluation of fixed assets. 
  In this event the following are applied to determine the 
option of concessions offered to labor collective members: 
  --the minimum wage in effect at the time when the state 
(municipal) enterprise was registered (founded); 
  --the average numerical strength of the enterprise's work 
force according to figures reported for the six months preceding 
the valuation. 
  5.3.6. With a view to safeguarding the interests of 
stockholders, any increase in the joint-stock company's 
authorized capital is prohibited until 90 percent of the stock 
of the enterprise being privatized is sold. 
<H3>  B. Concessions to Members of the Labor Collective and the 
Administration of an Enterprise Being Privatized Offered 
Following the Completion of the Sale of Shares for Privatization 
Checks </H3>
  5.3.7. The following rights are granted in the event that 
more than 80 percent of the joint-stock company's shares are 
sold and the volume of shares set by legislation for sale 
against privatization checks is also sold: 
  --members of the labor collective of the enterprise being 
privatized can begin purchasing (partially acquiring without 
payment) shares from the enterprise workers' flotation fund, 
provided that this fund was incorporated in a privatization plan 
ratified prior to the Program's promulgation; 
  --the joint-stock company can, as part of the privatization 
process, buy the plot of land on which the enterprise being 
privatized stands in accordance with current legislation. In 
this process, the vendors of such land plots are the relevant 
property funds. The distribution of funds acquired as a result 
of the sale of land plots is effected according to normatives 
contained in Appendix No. 1 to this program.

**Funds are distributed in accordance with the statutes elaborated by the relevant 
ministries, with 1 percent of the aforementioned funds being used to encourage the 
activity of privatization process organizers. 

***At least 50 percent of the funds earned as a result of privatization and received 
by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo are channeled into the holding of check auctions. 
If the holding of check auctions and check investment tenders results in a shortage 
of the cash available for transfer to the privatization organs under the normatives 
prescribed by this table, the shortage in question is made up from local budget 
funds. 

The management of these funds is effected by a joint group comprising 
representatives of the Russian Goskomimushchestvo and the Russian Federal Property 
Fund. 


<H3>  C. Concessions for Members of the Labor Collective and the 
Administration in the Event of a Controlling Interest Remaining 
in State (Municipal) Ownership </H3>
  5.3.8. In the event of a controlling interest remaining in

commission report based on the results of its yearly inspection, 
submitted to the annual meeting of stockholders, are approved by 
the joint-stock company's board of directors no later than 60 
calendar days after the end of the fiscal year. In the event of 
the board of directors not approving the joint-stock company's

commission does not decide to approve the deal; 
  --on participation in holding companies, associations of 
enterprises, and financial-industrial groups; 
  --on the reorganization and liquidation of a joint-stock 
company. The provisions of this paragraph extend to open-type

for joint-stock companies with more than 10,000 stockholders --

board of directors each ordinary share has the same number of 
votes as the number of members of the board. In the election 
stockholders can cast all or part of the votes attaching to 
their ordinary shares for one or several candidates for board 
membership. The candidates who gain the largest number of votes 
are deemed to have been elected to the board of directors.

<H5>  10. Utilization of Foreign Investment </H5>
  10.1. Foreign investors can take part in auctions (including 
check auctions), tenders, and investment tenders, as well as 
buying privatization checks for use as a means of payment in the 
privatization process provided that mandatory subsequent 
notification is given to the Russian Finance Ministry. No 
additional permission from Russian Federation state committees, 
ministries, and departments, organs of state administration of 
the republics within the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the 
autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, or the cities of Moscow 
and St. Petersburg is required for foreign corporate entities or 
individuals to utilize privatization checks in the privatization 
process. 
  When deals are being completed with foreign investors the 
sole vendors of state and municipal property will be the 
corresponding property funds (property management committees). 
  If foreign investors are the only participants in an 
auction, 
tender, or investment tender, enterprises may be sold to them. 
In this case the relevant property fund makes a special 
valuation of the enterprise's property using a procedure 
ratified by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo in conjunction with 
the Russian Finance Ministry. 
  Foreign investors will be allowed to participate in the 
privatization of facilities and enterprises in the sphere of 
trade, public catering, and everyday services to the population, 
as well as small (less than 200 registered workers or a book 
value of less than R1 million as of 1 January 1992) industrial, 
construction, or motor transport enterprises only with the 
permission of local organs of power or organs authorized by them. 
  Decisions to possibly permit foreign investors to take part 
in the privatization of facilities and enterprises in the 
defense industry (those where defense orders account for more 
than 30 percent of total output) or the oil and gas industry, 
enterprises extracting and processing strategic ores, precious 
and semiprecious stones, or radioactive and rare-earth elements, 
or the transport and communication enterprises indicated in 
Section 2.2 of this Program are made by the Russian Federation 
Government or the governments of republics within the Russian 
Federation (depending on the type of state ownership) at the 
same time as decisions to permit the privatization of the 
aforesaid facilities and enterprises. And, following the holding 
of a check (money) auction (tender) the organizers send the 
Russian Federation Government and the Russian Federation Federal 
Counterintelligence Service information on the successful 
foreign bidders. The Russian Federation Federal 
Counterintelligence Service is entitled to submit to the Russian 
Federation Government within one month a reasoned conclusion on 
the need to prohibit the acquisition of shares, stakes, 
holdings, or property by the aforesaid foreign investors. The 
Russian Federation Government adopts a corresponding decree on 
this basis. 
  The utilization of foreign investment in the privatization 
of 
state and municipal enterprises located within a closed 
territorial formation is not permitted, save in cases stipulated 
by Russian Federation Government decrees. 
  There are no other restrictions on foreign investors' 
participation in privatization.

Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The State Program for the Privatization of State and 
Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation (hereinafter 
referred to as the Program) is a federal program in the field of 
the economic and social development of the Russian Federation 
elaborated in accordance with the requirements of the Russian 
Federation Law "On the Privatization of State and Municipal 
Enterprises in the Russian Federation" taking account of the 
experience and results of privatization conducted in 1992-1993. 
  The program sets the objectives, targets, priorities, 
limitations, and procedures for privatization. 
  Broad interpretation of the restrictions on privatization 
indicated in the Program, and also in local privatization 
programs, is not permitted. 
  The main objectives of the Program are: 
  --the formation of a broad stratum of private property 
owners 
as the economic basis of market relations; 
  --the involvement in the privatization process of the 
broadest possible strata of the population through the sale of 
privatizable state and municipal property for privatization 
checks at specialized check auctions prior to 1 July 1994 and 
for money at auctions after 1 July 1994; 
  --the completion of privatization involving the use of 
privatization checks; 
  --the completion of the privatization of most "small-scale 
privatization" facilities and the acceleration on this basis of 
the development of the trade and services sphere; 
  --the completion in the main of the privatization of large 
and medium-sized enterprises in industry and construction and 
the improvement of the performance of enterprises and the 
national economy as a whole on the basis of the implementation 
of structural restructuring of the economy, the development of 
post-privatization support for enterprises, the creation of a 
competitive environment, and the development of the capital 
market; 
  --the attraction of investment, including foreign 
investment, 
into production; 
  --assistance in the implementation of measures to provide 
social support for the population, including the protection of 
the rights of private property owners (stockholders). 
  Facilities and enterprises in federal, state, and municipal 
ownership are divided into the following groups on the basis of 
their suitability for privatization: 
  --facilities and enterprises in federal ownership whose 
privatization is prohibited; 
  --facilities and enterprises in federal ownership whose 
privatization is effected by Russian Federation Government 
decision; 
  --facilities and enterprises whose privatization is effected 
by decision of the Russian Federation State Committee for the 
Management of State Property (hereinafter referred to as the 
Russian Goskomimushchestvo) taking account of the opinion of 
sector ministries; 
  --facilities and enterprises in state (municipal) ownership 
whose privatization is effected in accordance with the Program 
by decision of organs of state power and administration of the 
republics within the Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the 
autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and the cities of Moscow 
and St. Petersburg and with local privatization programs; 
  facilities and enterprises in federal or state (municipal) 
ownership subject to compulsory privatization. 
  The privatization of facilities and enterprises in federal 
or 
state (municipal) ownership which are not included in the 
targets and are not subject to restrictions on privatization is 
effected on the on the basis of decisions by territorial 
property management committees or of privatization applications 
submitted by any persons. 
  In the event that an application for the privatization of an 
enterprise is submitted by the labor collective or by any 
individual or corporate third party acknowledged as the 
purchaser in the privatization process, the appropriate property 
management committee is obligated to adopt a decision on the 
privatization of the enterprise and must mandatorily inform the 
applicant of the decision adopted. 
  The privatization of state and municipal educational 
establishments is governed by the relevant legislation. 
  Pending the adoption of a law or other Russian Federation 
legislative act, health-care institutions and enterprises, and 
also pharmacies, are privatized in accordance with a special 
procedure to be approved by the Russian Federation Government. 
  Questions relating to the privatization of facilities in the 
ownership of republics within the Russian Federation, krays,

federal ownership for a period of up to three years the Russian 
Federation Government and the Russian Goskomimushchestvo are 
entitled, in accordance with the powers laid down by the State 
Program for the Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises 
in the Russian Federation, to instruct such persons as they may 
decide, including officials of organs of state administration at 
the submission of the relevant ministries, departments, and 
regions, to represent on a contract basis the state's interests 
on the board of directors of the joint-stock company. Officials 
of organs of state administration appointed under the 
aforementioned procedure to the boards of directors of 
joint-stock companies carry out their activities on an unpaid 
basis. 
  In converting into joint-stock companies enterprises 
indicated in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the Program the Russian 
Federation Government or the Russian Goskomimushchestvo in the 
light of proposals from ministries and departments can adopt a 
decision on the issue of a "golden share" for a period of up to 
three years during the share flotation. 
  The simultaneous retention in state ownership of a "golden 
share" and other blocks of shares is not permitted. 
  If a "golden share" is issued concessions are granted to the 
labor collective according to the procedure laid down by the 
Program. 
  The Russian Federation Government and the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo are entitled to adopt a decision to replace 
blocks of shares retained in federal ownership by a "golden 
share." 
  Dividends on shares retained in federal, state ownership are 
channeled entirely into funding social, cultural, and everyday 
facilities transferred as part of the process of converting the 
enterprise into a joint-stock company to the books sheet of 
local organs of power and remaining on the enterprise's books 
and used for the original purpose, or, if there are no such 
facilities, are channeled into the federal budget under the 
procedure envisaged by a statute elaborated by the Russian 
Ministry of Finance in coordination with the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo. 
  This procedure for the allocation of dividends may be 
changed 
only by decision of the Russian Federation Government. 
  The inclusion of state enterprises in the groups to which 
restrictions apply according to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the 
Program, the adoption of decisions to retain blocks of shares in 
state ownership or issue a "golden share," and also the 
representation by officials of organs of state administration of 
the state's interests on the boards of directors of joint-stock 
companies are carried out in accordance with the statute 
elaborated by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo and approved by the 
Russian Federation Government. 
  The fact that an enterprise has a defense order not 
exceeding 
30 percent of the total volume of output sold by the enterprise, 
and also duties regarding mobilization preparation, the 
protection of state secrets, and the ensuring of safe working is 
no grounds for the retention of any blocks of shares in federal 
ownership when it is converted into a joint-stock company. 
  Shares in privatized enterprises not retained in federal 
ownership under Section 2.3 of the Program must be sold no later 
than four months from the time of registration of the 
joint-stock company and cannot be reserved in any way.

territorial and sector levels, the Russian Goskomimushchestvo 
sets for republics within the Russian Federation, krays, 
oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg calculated targets for the 
flotation and privatization of enterprises in the form of a 
cumulative total and for the realization of privatization 
checks, these targets forming an integral part of the Program. 
  The calculated indicators are conveyed to the regions within

  3.2. On the basis of the targets the property management 
committees of republics within the Russian Federation, krays, 
oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous okrugs, and the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg elaborate local 
privatization programs and forecast receipts of privatization 
checks and money as a result of privatization. The local 
privatization programs approved by the relevant organs of power 
are submitted to the Russian Goskomimushchestvo and the Russian 
Federal Property Fund. 
<H3>  4. The Formation and Distribution of the Proceeds of 
Privatization </H3>
  4.1. By the funds received as a result of privatization is 
meant the entire proceeds in money and privatization checks from 
the sale of privatized facilities and the revenue received in 
the privatization process in the form of registration fees, 
guarantees, and other revenue. 
  The dividends from shares belonging to the state and rent 
payments for the leasing of state and municipal property are not 
included in the funds from privatization and are paid into the 
corresponding budget minus bank charges (except for instances 
indicated in Sections 2.3 and 6 of the Program). 
  4.2. The total revenue from privatization in 1994 is 
estimated at R0.7 trillion in privatization checks and R0.8 
trillion in cash. 
  The dividends on shares retained in federal and state 
ownership in 1994 are estimated at R200 billion. 
  4.3. The funds from privatization, including privatization 
checks, are distributed according to normatives in conformity 
with Appendix No. 1 to the Program in the following order: With 
labor collectives, money settlements are made with privatization 
organs and local budgets and payments are made into the Federal 
Enterprise Support Fund; privatization checks count toward the 
funds paid into the Russian Federation republic budget and the 
corresponding budgets of republics within the Russian 
Federation, krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous 
okrugs, and the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
  If blocks of shares are retained in state ownership, the 
remainder [of the shares] is treated as 100 percent during the 
distribution of the funds received from privatization. 
  4.4. The Russian Federation Government is entitled to adjust

facilities, 
including those that do not form part of the property of a 
joint-stock company and those that are transferred into the 
charge of local organs of power during the privatization process; 
  --into financing measures for the post-privatization support 
of enterprises. 
  4.8. In cities under rayon jurisdiction and in cities with 
administrative-territorial divisions (rayons, settlements), the 
funds from privatization channeled into local budgets can, at 
the petition of the heads of administration of cities and urban 
rayons (settlements) and by decision of the heads of 
administration of cities and rayons during the sale of municipal 
property or [by decision] of the organs of state power of 
Russian Federation components during the sale of state property, 
be channeled by the sellers into the budgets of these 
administrative-territorial formations in order to fund the 
maintenance of social, cultural, and everyday facilities 
transferred to municipal ownership during the privatization of 
enterprises. 
  4.9. The Russian Ministry of Finance Control and Auditing 
Administration together with the Russian Goskomimushchestvo 
monitors the timeliness and correctness of privatization organs' 
payments to budgets at various levels. 
<H3>  5. Methods of Privatization and Concessions Granted During 
Privatization </H3>
  The specific method of privatizing an enterprise is 
determined by the privatization working commission or the 
privatization commission of the relevant property management 
committee in accordance with the Russian Federation Law "On the 
Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian 
Federation," the Russian Federation president's Edict No. 721 of 
1 July 1992 "On Organizational Measures To Convert State 
Enterprises and Voluntary Associations of State Enterprises Into 
Joint-Stock Companies," the state and local privatization 
programs, and normative acts not contravening the present 
Program. 
  It is laid down that amendments and additions to Section 2 
of 
the privatization plan can be made by the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo, with mandatory notification of the relevant 
financial organs and enterprises undergoing privatization. It is 
not permitted to make amendments and additions to the 
privatization plan after publication of the announcement of the 
sale of a privatized facility. 
  5.1. All state (municipal) enterprises are divided into two 
groups in relation to the privatization methods they employ: 
  --the first group includes small enterprises with fixed 
capital of a book value as of 1 January 1992 of no more than R1 
million which are subject to sale by auction, competitive 
tender, and investment competition. The labor collectives of 
these enterprises are entitled, by a qualified majority of 
two-thirds of the votes of all members (at a general meeting or 
else confirmed by sheets of signatures), to choose the method of 
sale: at auction or by investment competitions without 
restriction on the participants. This decision is binding on the 
relevant property management committees; 
  --the second group includes all other enterprises, which may 
be privatized by any method envisaged in Point 5.2 of the 
Program. 
  In the event of a failure to fulfill the requirements of the 
present Program, the Russian Federation president's Edicts No. 
721 of 1 July 1992 and No. 1228 of 14 October 1992 "On the Sale 
for Privatization Checks of Housing Stock, Parcels of Land, and 
Municipal Property," or Decree No. 757 of the Russian Federation 
Council of Ministers-Government dated 10 August 1993 "On the 
Implementation of Additional Measures To Protect the Right of 
Russian Citizens To Take Part in Privatization," property 
management committees (ministries and departments) are entitled 
under the established procedure to decide to dissolve contracts 
concluded earlier with enterprise leaders or, in the absence of 
contracts, to dismiss them from their posts. In this case the 
conversion of enterprises into joint-stock companies takes place 
on the initiative of the relevant property management committee 
under the established procedure, with members of their labor 
collectives being granted concessions only under the first 
option (Point 5.3.1) in the Program. 
  5.2. Under the procedure established by the Program the use 
of the following privatization methods is envisaged: 
  --the sale of shares in open-type joint-stock companies 
created during the privatization process; 
  --the sale of enterprises that are not joint-stock companies 
at auctions; 
  --the sale of enterprises that are not joint-stock companies 
by commercial tender (including tenders with restrictions on 
participants); 
  --the sale of blocks of shares in joint-stock companies by 
investment competition; 
  --the sale of the property (assets) of functioning 
enterprises, enterprises in the process of being liquidated, and 
liquidated enterprises, and also of facilities whose 
construction is unfinished, at auctions and by tender; 
  --the purchase of leased property; the sale of enterprises 
to 
partnerships created in accordance with the additional 
concessions envisaged by Point 5.16; 
  --the sale of stakes (holdings, shares) in state or 
municipal 
ownership by auction and commercial tender, including tenders 
with restrictions on the participants. 
<H3>  5.3. The Sale of Shares in an Open-Type Joint-Stock Company 
Created in the Process of Privatizations </H3>
<H3>  A. Concessions to Members of the Labor Collective in 
Converting a State (Municipal) Enterprise Into an Open-Type 
Joint-Stock Company </H3>

  5.3.1. During the sale (free transfer) of shares in 
open-type 
joint-stock companies created via the conversion of state and 
municipal enterprises (including those previously converted into 
closed-type joint-stock companies), the enterprise labor 
collective decides to apply one of the options for granting 
concessions to the labor collective of a privatized enterprise 
envisaged by the Program, and these concessions also extend to: 
  --workers for whom the enterprise in question is their main 
workplace; former workers who have at least 10 years' record 
of work at the privatized enterprise for men and at least 7 
years six months' for women and who left at their own request 
(including by virtue of transfer to other work), as a result of 
downsizing or staff reductions, and also during the 
reorganization of enterprises; 
  --persons having the right under Russian Federation 
legislation to return to their former job at the enterprise, 
including persons drafted into military service while working at 
a state (municipal) enterprise before its conversion into a 
joint-stock company, provided that they return to their former 
job within three months of demobilization; 
  --pensioners who made their pension arrangements and retired 
at the enterprise in question; 
  --persons dismissed from the enterprise as a result of 
downsizing or staff reductions after 1 January 1992 and 
registered as unemployed; 
  -workers of these enterprises who retired on an invalidity 
pension as a result of on-the-job injury or occupational disease; 
  --family members who are the heirs of workers at the 
enterprise who died at the given production facility. 
  All persons to whom the concessions in question apply are 
included in the number of personnel on equal terms with the 
workers for whom the enterprise is the main workplace. 
<H6>  Option 1 </H6>
  All members of the labor collective of the privatized 
enterprise and persons of equivalent status and the right to 
concessions: 
  --receive a one-time free transfer of personalized 
privileged 
(nonvoting) shares making up 25 percent of the authorized 
capital but totaling no more than 20 times the legally 
established minimum wage per worker; 
  ordinary shares making up to 10 percent of the authorized 
capital but totaling no more than six times the legally 
established minimum wage per worker are sold by restricted 
subscription to members of the labor collective at 30 percent 
below face value with payment by installments over up to three 
months; the size of the initial installment cannot be less than 
50 percent of the face value of the shares. 
  The administration of the privatized enterprise -- the 
leader, his deputy, the chief engineer, the chief accountant, 
the leader of a separate subsidiary structural component or 
subsidiary -- on the basis of the terms of the contracts 
concluded with them is granted the right to purchase at face 
value ordinary shares worth a total of up to 5 percent of the 
authorized capital, but no more than 2,000-times the minimum 
wage established by Russian Federation legislation per person. 
  At enterprises with an average staff of over 10,000 people 
and with separate subsidiary structural components, shops, and 
sections, and also in cases where a privatization plan envisages 
the restructuring of an enterprise and the formation of 
subsidiary enterprises, the list of administration officials 
with the right to this concession may be extended by decision of 
the labor collective. 
<H6>  Option 2 </H6>
  All members of the labor collective of the enterprise being 
privatized and persons of equal status who are entitled to 
concessions are given the right to acquire ordinary (voting) 
shares representing up to 51 percent of the authorized capital. 
  In this event: 
  --there is no free transfer or sale of shares on 
concessionary terms; 
  --the selling price of shares is determined according to the 
Statute on Restricted Subscriptions ratified by the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo. 
<H6>  Option 3 </H6>
  If a group of enterprise workers or any individual or 
corporate entity, recognized as purchasers under Article 9 of 
the Russian Federation Law "On the Privatization of State and 
Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation," undertakes 
responsibility for fulfilling the enterprise's privatization 
plans and preventing its bankruptcy and acquires the consent of 
the labor collective's general meeting to conclude the 
appropriate contract whose term cannot exceed one year (without 
the right to extend it), the members of this group are given the 
right to acquire 30 percent of the authorized capital in the 
form of ordinary shares in the enterprises at nominal value when 
the aforementioned term has expired and the conditions of the 
aforementioned contract have been fulfilled. 
  The procedure for concluding the shares acquisition contract 
with the group of workers is prescribed by the statute approved 
by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo. 
  While the contract is in force, the aforementioned group is 
given the right to vote on behalf of all shares held by the 
relevant property fund. 
  The privatization plan incorporates the conditions of the 
contract, whose conclusion with the aforementioned group of 
joint-stock company founders is mandatory. The contract defines 
the group members' obligations and the limit of their material 
liability guaranteed by privately-owned property (pledged by way 
of a mortgage) amounting to at least 200 times the minimum wage 
prescribed by Russian Federation legislation at the time the 
mortgage is pledged per group member. 
  Under this option, ordinary shares are sold to all 
enterprise 
workers (including the group members) to a total value of 20 
percent of the authorized capital but not in excess of 20 times 
the minimum wage prescribed by Russian Federation legislation 
per worker, with a 30-percent discount on the face value and a 
three-month deferment of payment. Furthermore, the amount of the 
first instalment cannot be less than 25 percent of the share's 
face value. 
  In the event of the group failing to fulfill the contract 
conditions, the shares due to be sold to this group's members 
are sold to the population at check auctions (at money auctions 
after 1 July 1994). 
  The procedure for the allocation of shares to be transferred 
without payment (when Option 1 is chosen) is determined by a 
general meeting (conference) of the labor collective by a simple 
majority of votes. 
  The sale of shares to labor collective members and persons 
of 
equal status within the limits of the concessions prescribed by 
this Program is effected by way of restricted subscription in 
accordance with the statute approved by the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo. 
  Property management committees are permitted to extend to 
three months the deadline for holding restricted subscriptions 
for shares among enterprise workers on the basis of specific 
enterprises' specific production activity. The sale of shares 
transferred to property funds can be effected prior to the 
conclusion of the restricted subscription. 
  The decision on the choice of option of concessions 
prescribed by the Program is adopted by a general meeting of the 
labor collective or is certified by a list of its members' 
signatures. The decision is deemed adopted if at least 
two-thirds of the total number of enterprise workers have voted 
(signed) in favor of it. In the absence of such a decision, 
concessions are granted according to Option 1. 
  The workers of enterprises belonging to the same 
technological complex as the enterprise being privatized, 
regardless of the concessions option which has been chosen by 
decision of the labor collective, are given the right to 
participate in the restricted subscription to shares held among 
workers of the enterprise being privatized on the same 
conditions. 
  5.3.2. Any shares acquired or received free by citizens or 
corporate entities can be sold by the owner without any 
restrictions. The imposition of restrictions is prohibited. 
  5.3.3. The determination of the initial price of state 
(municipal) enterprises when being sold at auction or via 
commercial (noncommercial) or investment tender is effected 
according to the procedure prescribed by the Interim 
Methodological Recommendations for Estimating the Value of 
Facilities Being Privatized, ratified by Edict No. 66 of the 
Russian Federation president of 29 January 1992 "On Accelerating 
the Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises," with due 
consideration for the amendments introduced by Directive No. 763 
of the Russian Goskomimushchestvo of 13 November 1993 "On Some 
Questions Concerning the Application of the Interim 
Methodological Recommendations for Estimating the Value of 
Facilities Being Privatized." 
  The valuation of property is effected on the basis of 
balance 
sheet figures for the accounting quarter preceding the 
computation of the valuation. The value of fixed assets 
represented by incomplete construction work and uninstalled 
equipment is determined in the valuation document without taking 
into account the results of the revaluation of fixed assets 
conducted in accordance with Decree No. 595 of the Russian 
Federation Government of 14 August 1992 "On the Revaluation of 
Fixed Assets (Capital) in the Russian Federation" or any 
subsequent revaluation of fixed assets. 
  The actual profit earned by enterprises in 1993-1994 is not 
a 
source for forming the enterprise workers' privatization fund 
and is not excluded from the value of property when determining 
the enterprise's initial price. 
  5.3.4. When state (municipal) enterprises are being 
converted 
into open-type joint-stock companies, the amount of authorized 
capital is determined on the basis of balance sheet figures as 
at 1 July 1992 without taking into account the results of the 
revaluation of fixed assets conducted in accordance with Decree 
No. 595 of the Russian Federation Government of 14 August 1992 
"On the Revaluation of Fixed Assets (Capital) in the Russian 
Federation" or any subsequent revaluation of fixed assets, or 
any foreign currency items appearing on the balance sheet. 
  In this event the following are applied in order to 
determine 
the option of concessions offered to labor collective members: 
  --the minimum wage as at 1 July 1992 (900 rubles [R]); 
  --the average numerical strength of the enterprise's work 
force according to figures reported for the first six months of 
1992. 
  All changes in the composition and value of property since 1 
July 1992 are treated as changes to the composition and value of 
property owned by the joint-stock company. 
  The actual profit earned by enterprises in 1993-1994 is not 
a 
source for forming the enterprise workers' privatization fund 
and is not excluded from the value of property when determining 
the amount of authorized capital. 
  5.3.5. The amount of authorized capital of joint-stock 
companies created via the conversion of state (municipal) 
enterprises founded (registered) since 1 July 1992 is determined 
on the basis of balance sheet figures for the accounting quarter 
preceding the valuation. 
  When determining the amount of authorized capital, the value 
of fixed assets represented by incomplete construction work and 
uninstalled equipment is determined in the valuation document 
without taking into account the results of the revaluation of 
fixed assets conducted in accordance with Decree No. 595 of the 
Russian Federation Government of 14 August 1992 "On the 
Revaluation of Fixed Assets (Capital) in the Russian Federation"

*The normatives for the distribution of funds earned as a result of privatization to 
the accounts of relevant property funds and committees for the management of 
property come into force 1 January 1994. 

**Funds are distributed in accordance with the statutes elaborated by the relevant 
ministries, with 1 percent of the aforementioned funds being used to encourage the 
activity of privatization process organizers. 

***At least 50 percent of the funds earned as a result of privatization and received 
by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo are channeled into the holding of check auctions. 
If the holding of check auctions and check investment tenders results in a shortage 
of the cash available for transfer to the privatization organs under the normatives 
prescribed by this table, the shortage in question is made up from local budget 
funds. 

The management of these funds is effected by a joint group comprising 
representatives of the Russian Goskomimushchestvo and the Russian Federal Property 
Fund. 


<H3>  C. Concessions for Members of the Labor Collective and the 
Administration in the Event of a Controlling Interest Remaining 
in State (Municipal) Ownership </H3>
  5.3.8. In the event of a controlling interest remaining in 
state (municipal) ownership, concessions to enterprise workers 
are offered as follows: 
  --if the controlling interest totals 51 percent of the total 
stock, all members of the labor collective and persons with 
equal status receive as a one-shot transfer and without payment 
personally-registered privileged stock comprising 25 percent of 
the authorized capital but not more than 20 times the minimum 
wage set by Russian Federation legislation per worker. No other 
concessions are offered; 
  --if the controlling interest totals 38 percent of the total 
stock, then concessions to labor collective members and persons 
of equal status are offered in accordance with Option 1 of 
concessions (Point 5.3.1. of the Program). 
  No enterprise workers' flotation fund is formed in either 
case, and all remaining unallocated shares are subject to sale 
at specialized check auctions (money auctions after 1 July 1994). 
  If 25.5 percent of the shares remain in state ownership, 
concessions to labor collective members and persons of equal 
status are offered in accordance with Option 1 of concessions, 
and all remaining stock is subject to sale at specialized check 
auctions. 
<H3>  D. Acquisition (Sale) of Stock from Enterprise Workers' 
Flotation Fund </H3>
  5.3.9. No provision is made for the creation of an 
Enterprise 
Workers' Flotation Fund (hereinafter referred to as FARP) at 
enterprises which have filed a privatization application since 1 
February 1994. 
  The acquisition (sale) of stock from the FARP is effected 
according to the procedure prescribed by the Russian Federation 
Government and this Program. When state and municipal 
enterprises are converted into open-type joint-stock companies, 
a FARP can be formed following a proposal by the labor 
collective by using a contribution from the relevant property 
fund, provided its total value does not exceed 10 percent of the 
enterprise's authorized capital if Option 1 or Option 3 of 
concessions has been chosen, or 5 percent thereof if Option 2 of 
concessions for labor collective members has been chosen. 
  The transfer of shares from the FARP is effected when 80 
percent of the shares have been sold and following completion of 
the sale of the amount of shares prescribed by legislation for 
sale against privatization checks. Furthermore, a proportion of 
the total amount of FARP shares, comprising one-tenth of the 
total amount of shares in the relevant joint-stock company sold 
against privatization checks (excluding shares sold or 
transferred to the labor collective on concessionary terms), is 
to be transferred without payment to labor collective members. 
  The FARP is formed for a term of not more than two years 
from 
the time the joint-stock company is registered. The right to 
acquire shares from the FARP is vested in labor collective 
members whose main job is with the relevant joint-stock company. 
  5.4. Sale of Joint-Stock Companies' Shares at Specialized 
Check Auctions 
  5.4.1. The main form of share sale through 1 July 1994 is 
the 
sale of shares at specialized check auctions, whose procedure is 
determined by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo, as well as at 
interregional specialized check auctions and interregional 
all-Russia specialized check auctions held in accordance with 
Decree No. 786 of the Russian Federation Council of 
Ministers-Government of 10 August 1993 "On the Sale of Shares at 
Interregional Specialized Check Auctions." 
  The conditions for holding interregional and interregional 
all-Russia specialized check auctions are regulated by the 
Russian Goskomimushchestvo. All holders of privatization 
checks recognized as purchasers in accordance with Russian 
Federation legislation are permitted to participate in 
specialized check auctions. 
  5.4.2. A specialized check auction is a means for selling 
shares by bids, whereby: 
  --all winning bids acquire shares at a uniform price; 
participation in the auction is gained by submitting one of two 
types of application, indicating either only the amount of 
privatization checks (Category 1 application), or the amount of 
privatization checks for shares indicating a minimum number of 
nominal value shares per privatization check (Category 2 
application); 
  --persons submitting Category 1 applications are always 
among 
the bid winners. 
  The sale of shares at specialized check auctions is effected 
by the relevant property fund, property management committee or 
its representative, or the enterprise being privatized, in 
accordance with Edict No. 1229 of the Russian Federation 
president of 14 October 1992 "On Developing the Privatization 
Check System in the Russian Federation." 
  The application of different procedures for holding 
specialized check auctions, except as prescribed by directive 
No. 701 of the Russian Goskomimushchestvo of 4 November 1992, is 
prohibited. 
  The sale of shares in enterprises being privatized at 
specialized check auctions is effected in accordance with 
privatization plans endorsed by property management committees 
and with schedules for the holding of specialized check auctions 
which are mandatory for property funds. Furthermore, the sale 
of shares at specialized check auctions is permitted before the 
completion of the restricted subscription for shares among labor 
collective members. 
  5.4.3. An interregional specialized check auction is an 
auction held according to the procedure prescribed by the 
Statute for Specialized Check Auctions ratified by Directive No. 
701 of the Russian Goskomimushchestvo of 4 November 1992. The 
collection of applications for participation in interregional

the collection of applications for participation in it must be 
organized simultaneously on the territory of at least 25 
components of the Russian Federation. 
  When an interregional all-Russia specialized check auction 
is 
being held, it is mandatory to organize the collection of 
applications in the city of Moscow. 5.4.5. Property funds 
ensure the sale of at least 29 percent of the shares of a 
joint-stock company in accordance with the privatization plan 
(with the exception of joint-stock companies created on the 
basis of fuel and energy complex enterprises being privatized in 
accordance with the Russian Federation president's Edicts No. 
923 of 15 August 1992, No. 1333 and No. 1334 of 5 November 1992, 
No. 1403 of 17 November 1992, and No. 1702 of 30 December 1992) 
not later than two months following the transformation and 
exclusively at specialized check auctions. 
  The shares of joint-stock companies created in the process 
of 
privatization and held in federal ownership, the book value of 
whose fixed assets exceeds R250 million, are eligible for sale 
exclusively at interregional and interregional all-Russia 
specialized check auctions held by property funds in accordance 
with the Statute for Holding Interregional All-Russia 
Specialized Check Auctions ratified by Directive No. 1853 of the 
Russian Goskomimushchestvo of 28 October 1993 and in accordance 
with the schedule endorsed by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo. 
  5.4.6. In the event that a joint-stock company's shares are 
offered as payment for the authorized capital of another 
joint-stock company (holding company), shares in the latter to 
the equivalent nominal value must be sold at a specialized check 
auction and reflected in this joint-stock company's 
privatization plan. Furthermore, it is mandatory for sale of the 
shares to be held also in the home region of the joint-stock 
company whose shares were invested in the holding company. 
  After 1 July 1994 shares will be sold at auctions for money 
in accordance with the statute ratified by the Russian 
Goskomimushchestvo. 
<H3>  5.5. Sale of Enterprises Which Are Not Joint-Stock Companies 
at Auctions </H3>
  A sale at auction occurs when, as a result of open bidding, 
indivduals or corporate entities acquire as private property 
facilities being privatized and the purchasers are not required 
to fulfill any conditions whatsoever as regards the facility 
being privatized. 
  The right of ownership is transferred to the purchaser who 
offers the highest price in the course of the bidding. 
  In this event, workers of the enterprise being privatized, 
as well as persons dismissed from this enterprise as a result of 
personnel cutbacks or downsizing since 1 January 1992 and 
registered as unemployed who have not acquired any ownership 
right as a result of the auction, will receive 30 percent of the 
money thus earned, but not more than 40 times the minimum wage 
set by Russian Federation legislation per worker. 
<H3>  5.6. Sale of Enterprises Which Are Not Joint-Stock Companies 
by Commercial Tender (Including Tender with Limited Number of 
Participants) </H3>
  5.6.1. A sale by commercial tender occurs when individuals 
or 
corporate entities acquire as private property facilities being 
privatized and the purchasers are required to fulfill some 
conditions as regards the facility being privatized. The list of 
tender conditions is determined in accordance with the Statute 
for the Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the 
Russian Federation by Tender. The imposition of any conditions 
not contained in the aforementioned statute is not permitted. 
  The retention of the privatized facility's specialization 
and 
the prohibition of breaks in its work of for more than two 
months following the purchase-sale and (or) for a total of three 
months during a calendar year are mandatory conditions for the 
sale by tender of all facilities in the trade network, public 
catering, and everyday services. Any changes in the privatized 
facility's work schedule resulting in reductions are permitted 
only by agreement with the local administration. 
  In the event that workers of the enterprise being 
privatized, 
as well as persons dismissed from this enterprise as a result of 
personnel cutbacks or downsizing since 1 January 1992 and 
registered as unemployed, have not acquired any ownership right 
as a result of the tender, they will receive compensation 
equivalent to 20 percent of the money thus earned, but not more 
than 30 times the minimum wage set by Russian Federation 
legislation per worker. 
  5.6.2. Commercial tenders take the form of open auction bids 
or closed tenders. The acquisition right goes to the purchaser 
who has offered the highest price. 
  Sale by commercial tender with limited participation is 
permitted (in accordance with local privatization programs) only 
for the privatization of trade network, public catering, or 
everyday services enterprises located in rural localities, 
urban-type settlements, Far North regions, and equivalent 
localities. 
  Only workers in the enterprise being privatized and 
residents 
of the region in question are permitted to participate in such 
tenders. 
<H3>  5.7. Sale of Blocks of Shares in Joint-Stock Companies by 
Competitive Investment Tender </H3>
  Competitive investment tenders are used for the sale of 
blocks of shares in joint-stock companies belonging to the state 
when the purchasers are required to make investments. 
  The criterion used to determine the winning bid is the total 
amount of investment discounted for the entire period of the 
investment commitment by the discount rate of the Central Bank 
of the Russian Federation at the time the tender is held. 
  The following are mandatory requirements for competitive 
tendering: 
  --within one month from the conclusion of the competitive 
investment tendering, the winner must deposit in the 
enterprise's current account at least 20 percent of the total 
amount being invested (with 0.5 percent of this sum being 
remitted by the investment tender winner in equal shares to the 
accounts of the relevant property management committees and 
property fund); by decision of the Russian Federation Government 
the amount of the initial investment deposit may in individual 
cases be reduced to 10 percent; 
  --the investment deposit term is not more than three years; 
  --payment for the block of shares sold by investment tender 
is calculated at the stock's nominal value. 
  All investment tenders are open, in other words they are 
open to competition by all interested individuals and corporate 
entities. 
  Investment tenders are held in accordance with the statute 
ratified by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo. 
  A debt which an enterprise whose stock is being sold by 
investment tender owes to a bid-winning creditor is reduced by 
an amount equivalent to the latter's investment. 
  5.8. When state and municipal enterprises (and the property 
of enterprises in the process of liquidation) are sold by tender 
or at auction, a partnership (joint-stock company) comprising at 
least one-third of the total work force of the enterprise 
(subsidiary component) being privatized is offered a 30-percent 
discount on the sale price and a deferment of payment for up to 
three months. The amount of the initial deposit set by the 
privatization plan or, where the requisite written record is 
lacking, by the vendor, cannot be less than 25 percent of the 
sale price and can be paid by the purchaser in the following 
form: up to 80 percent in privatization checks and the remainder 
in cash. 
  5.9 Individuals and corporate entities who have become 
owners 
of privatized state and municipal enterprises at an auction 
(tender) are given the right to conclude long-term (for a term 
of at least 15 years) contracts to lease any state (municipal) 
nonresidential premises, buildings, or structures occupied by 
these enterprises and not included in the inventory of property 
acquired by the purchasers, as well as to acquire ownership 
rights to the aforementioned nonresidential premises, buildings, 
or structures immediately after the contract for the 
purchase-sale of the enterprise has come into force. In this 
event, the relevant committee for the management of property is 
the vendor. Such a buy-out is effected at a price to be 
determined according to the methodology to be ratified by the 
Russian Goskomimushchestvo. 
  The owners of privatized state (municipal) enterprises have 
the exclusive right to acquire property rights to the land plots 
occupied by these enterprises. 
  Any change in the terms of the contract for leasing the 
aforementioned premises, buildings, and structures from a 
previously concluded contract is permitted only subject to the 
parties' agreement, unless otherwise provided by the contract's 
terms. 
  5.10. In cases when, in the process of holding an auction 
(tender) for the sale of enterprises being privatized, an 
individual or corporate entity recognized as a purchaser in 
accordance with Article 9 of the Russian Federation Law "On the 
Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian 
Federation" is the sole participant in the auction (tender), any 
enterprise located in a rural locality or a workers' settlement 
will be sold to the aforementioned person at 10 times the 
property's value as determined in accordance with the valuation 
document, and at 100 times that value if the enterprise is 
located in an urban area. 
  In the event envisaged in Point 5.8. of this Program, the 
enterprise workers or the partnership (joint-stock company) who 
have purchased the enterprise will be offered no concessions. 
  5.11. When an enterprise is sold by tender or at auction in 
the process of privatization, the amount of deposit (earnest 
money) required to be paid by participants in the tender or 
auction is set at 100 percent of the facility's starting price, 
but not more than 1,000 times the minimum wage set by Russian 
Federation legislation. 
<H3>  5.12. Sale of Property (Assets) of Operating Enterprises, 
Enterprises in the Process of Liquidation, and Liquidated 
Enterprises, and of Incomplete Construction Projects, by Tender, 
at Auction, or by Investment Tender </H3>
  5.12.1. The sale of property (assets) of enterprises in the 
process of liquidation and liquidated enterprises is effected 
exclusively at auctions by the relevant property funds (property 
management committees) in accordance with a statute to be 
ratified by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo. 
  In this event workers of the enterprise, as well as persons 
dismissed from this enterprise as a result of personnel cutbacks 
or doznsizing since 1 January 1992 and registered as unemployed, 
will be paid a sum of up to 50 percent of the cash earned as a 
result of the sale of the property (assets) after satisfying the 
creditors' demands, but not more than 40 times the minimum 
monthly wage set by Russian Federation legislation per worker. 
  5.12.2. The sale of the property (assets) of operating state 
(municipal) enterprises is effected exclusively for cash, 
subject to permission from the relevant property management 
committee, at auction organized by the property fund according 
to procedures to be determined by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo. 
  In this event 80 percent of the funds earned as a result of 
the sale of property remain at the enterprise's disposal and 
cannot be allocated for wage payments, while 20 percent will be 
distributed in accordance with the normatives for the 
distribution of funds from privatization prescribed in Appendix 
No. 1 of this Program. 
  The results of the auction are formalized in a purchase-sale 
contract. 
  5.12.3. The privatization of the assets of incomplete 
construction projects is effected exclusively for money taking 
into account the opinion of ministries and departments: 
  --via the sale of these facilities' assets at auction or by 
tender; 
  --via the registration of an open joint-stock company with 
100-percent state capital with subsequent sale of stock. 
  The distribution of money revenue from the sale of the 
assets 
of incomplete construction projects is effected as follows: 
  --50 percent to the enterprise from whose property portfolio 
the assets of the incomplete construction projects were taken; 
  --the remaining money is distributed equally between the 
relevant property management committee and property fund and is 
channeled into financing the privatization process. 
  The decision to choose one of the aforementioned methods for 
the privatization of incomplete construction projects is adopted 
by the relevant property management committee. 
  Working commissions for the privatization of state 
(municipal) enterprises have the right to make decisions on 
excluding incomplete construction projects from the assets of an 
enterprise being privatized. The compilation of the final 
balance sheet is assigned to the relevant property management 
committee. In this event the incomplete construction projects 
will be privatized by the relevant property management committee 
fexclusively for money as facilities being state (municipal) 
property. 
<H5>  5.13. The Sale of Debtor Enterprises </H5>
  5.13.1 The sale of debtor enterprises is effected in 
accordance with an edict of the Russian Federation president.

questions and the adoption of decisions on compulsory 
privatization of state enterprises which cannot pay their debts 
and have an unsatisfactory balance sheet structure (with the 
exception of enterprises whose privatization is prohibited in 
accordance with the Program). 
  A compulsory privatization decision adopted by the said 
Federal Administration and documents drawn up by it are 
mandatory for the appropriate property management committee to 
privatize the enterprise. 
  The privatization of enterprises for which privatization 
restrictions have been prescribed is effected in accordance with 
a procedure determined by Russian Federation privatization 
legislation. 
  5.13.3. The requirements of Point 5.13 [as published] apply 
to all state (municipal) enterprises where the proportion in

it is laid down in the leasing contract, the cost of the 
purchase is defined as 10 times the value of the leased 
property. Additional agreements cannot be concluded with 
leasehold enterprises providing services for citizens and other 
enterprises and organizations in the sphere of trade, public

enterprise into an open-type joint-stock company.

credit resources to fund the holding of check auctions. 
  Local privatization programs can make provision for the 
assigning of credit resources for this purpose using funds at 
the disposal of the relevant local organs of power. 
  The Government of the Russian Federation, on behalf of the 
Russian Federation, must ensure the receipt of preferential 
credit from international financial organizations (banks) to 
support the process of privatization in Russia.

construction, or motor transport enterprises only with the 
permission of local organs of power or organs authorized by them.

enterprises extracting and processing strategic ores, precious 
and semiprecious stones, or radioactive and rare-earth elements, 
or the transport and communication enterprises indicated in

aforesaid facilities and enterprises. And, following the holding 
of a check (money) auction (tender) the organizers send the 
Russian Federation Government and the Russian Federation Federal 
Counterintelligence Service information on the successful 
foreign bidders. The Russian Federation Federal 
Counterintelligence Service is entitled to submit to the Russian 
Federation Government within one month a reasoned conclusion on

financial aid; 
  --components of the Russian Federation (in respect of 
facilities which belong to them) and relevant organs of local 
self-government (in respect of facilities in municipal 
ownership) which have adopted decisions to increase the

have a priority right to receive financial aid and preferential 
credits from federal organs of state power in meeting 
commitments to the federal budget;

present Program; such bonuses are paid without restriction on 
the number of multiples of monthly salary [used as the basis for 
computing bonuses] on the basis of proposals by the 
aforementioned organs of state administration; 
  --foreign technical aid and foreign credits are granted as a 
priority to enterprises which conduct their activity in the 
sphere of production and where the proportion of state property 
in their authorized capital is less than 25 percent (apart from 
those indicated in Section 2.1 and Point 2.2.6) unless otherwise 
stipulated by international (intergovernmental) agreements. 
  Monies and material assets granted by way of foreign 
technical aid and foreign credits channeled into supporting 
privatization in the Russian Federation are exempt from all 
types of taxation as well as from customs taxes and duties. 
<H5>  14. Features of Privatization in the Regions </H5>
  14.1. Property management committees and property funds of 
components of the Russian Federation will, by agreement with the

elaborated by the Russian Goskomimushchestvo, on condition that 
the privatization procedure and deadline are observed. 
  The aforementioned normative acts cannot contravene Russian 
Federation legislation on privatization, and this includes 
changing or amplifying methods of privatization. They cannot 
establish the procedure for the coordination, authorization, and 
ratification of documents -- or other procedures not envisaged 
by Russian Federation legislation and edicts of the Russian 
Federation president -- for the passing of documents concerning 
privatization by organs of state power and administration, a 
list of which is provided for by Russian Federation legislation

enterprises located in the areas of residence and economic 
activity of the small peoples of the North. 
<H3>  8. Procedure for Mutual Relations Among State Organs 
Effecting Privatization </H3>
  8.1. In the course of the adoption of decisions on the 
privatization of state and municipal property in the areas of 
residence and economic activity of the small peoples of the 
North, account is taken of the opinion of regional associations 
of small peoples of the North representing the interests of 
ethnic groups. 
  8.2. Russian Federation ministries and departments draw up 
and coordinate with the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Antimonopoly Policy and Support for New Economic Structures, and 
submit to the Russian Goskomimushchestvo, recommendations taking 
into account the peculiarities of enterprises located in regions 
of the Far North and equivalent localities in the course of 
privatization and of the exercise of the property owner's powers. 
  8.3. Where regional bodies effecting privatization (property 
management committees and property funds) located in regions of 
the Far North and equivalent localities have a financial 
deficit, the Russian Goskomimushchestvo and the Russian Federal 
Property Fund grant them financial assistance. 
<H3>  9. Formation of Special-Purpose Financial Funds From 
Resources Obtained Through Privatization </H3>
  9.1. Financial resources obtained from privatization and 
becoming available to the corresponding local self-government 
organs, other than funds formed in accordance with the State 
Program for Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in 
the Russian Federation, are channeled into the formation of the 
following special-purpose funds for regions of the Far North and 
equivalent localities: 
  --a fund for the support of persons who have lost their jobs 
and wish to move to regions of Russia where there is a manpower 
shortage, or to engage in agricultural activity. The fund's 
resources are to be spent on paying for travel and resettlement 
of migrants; 
  --a fund for the implementation of nature conservation 
measures; 
  --a fund for the economic and cultural development of the 
small peoples of the Far North. 
  9.2. The procedure for the formation and expenditure of 
special-purpose funds and the amount of resources directed to 
the said purposes are determined by the Russian Federation 
Government. 
<H5>  10. Requirements for Local Privatization Programs </H5>
  10.1. Local programs for the privatization of state and 
municipal enterprises located in regions of the Far North and 
equivalent localities are drawn up by the appropriate property 
management committees of republics within the Russian 
Federation, krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, autonomous 
okrugs, cities (other than cities under rayon jurisdiction), and 
rayons (other than rayons within cities) and are adopted by the 
appropriate local self-government organs taking into account the 
opinions of associations of the small peoples of the North 
insofar as the environment in which they live and work is 
affected. 
  10.2. Local privatization programs must be drafted 
(redrafted) in accordance with the requirements of the present 
Program and approved (reapproved) not later than one month after 
its publication. Local programs must be published in the press 
organs of the appropriate local self-government organs and 
submitted to the Russian Goskomimushchestvo. 
  10.3. Local programs must: 
  --not conflict with the State Program for Privatization of 
State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation or 
with the present Program; 
  --not include proposals for the privatization of enterprises 
that are not eligible for privatization or impose additional 
restrictions on the privatization of enterprises; 
  --include lists of specific enterprises (groups of 
enterprises) eligible for privatization, with special 
identification of enterprises located in areas of residence and 
economic activity of the small peoples of the North; 
  --include predictions of the funds to be obtained from 
privatization and the procedure and areas of their use; 
  --take account of the heterogeneous nature of the territory 
within administrative-territorial formations on the basis of 
natural and climatic parameters, their level of development, and 
their accessibility to transport; 
  --contain specific measures for demonopolization and the 
creation of a competitive environment by agreement with the 
appropriate territorial administrations of the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support 
for New Economic Structures; social protection for the 
population; support and development of enterprise; and 
protection of the environment, with the use of extrabudgetary 
funds and foreign investments for that purpose. 
  The property management committees of republics within the 
Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the autonomous oblast, 
autonomous okrugs, cities, and rayons (other than rayons within 
cities), with the consent of the appropriate organs of state 
power and administration of the Russian Federation and local 
self-government organs, may make amendments to republic and 
local privatization programs. 
  Monitoring of the fulfillment of local programs for the 
privatization of state and municipal enterprises located in 
regions of the Far North and equivalent localities is the 
responsibility of the Russian Goskomimushchestvo and the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Social and Economic Development 
of the North.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "The President Legitimizes </F>
the Russian Federation Committee for the Administration of State 
Property's Policy: Privatization Program Is Approved"] 
  [Text] The specifics of Russian denationalization, 
which is aimed simultaneously at creating millions of property 
owners and attracting major private investment in enterprises 
undergoing privatization, will remain as is. The evidence of 
that is the edict signed by President Boris Yeltsin on 24 
December 1993, "On the State Program for the Privatization of 
State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation." As 
Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays acknowledged, this 
document not only legitimizes the measures aimed at stimulating 
destatization of enterprises implemented by the Russian 
Federation Committee for the Administration of State Property 
[GKI], but also will ensure a "triumphal" completion of 
voucher-based privatization before 1 July 1994. It is obvious, 
however, that preserving a balance between social and economic 
interests in the post-privatization period will require 
additional regulatory measures, which will depend directly on 
how the political situation develops. 
  The State Privatization Program approved by the president 
envisages resolution of tasks both social (forming a broad 
stratum of property owners via voucher-based privatization) and 
economic (increasing the effectiveness of the national economy 
by attracting investment into production). The ideologues of 
voucher-based privatization believe that the above factors will 
permit them to complete denationalization in the environment of 
national consensus. Therefore, in the destatization of 
enterprises, privatization bodies will continue to take into 
account the opinion of labor collectives. In addition, 
preferential treatment has been expanded for socially 
disadvantaged strata of the population (in particular, the 
disabled, pensioners, and military servicemen). 
  At the same time, given the continuing production decline 
and 
the absence of obvious advantages of denationalization carried 
out so far, the authors of the State Privatization Program--GKI 
specialists--built into the document the stimuli for a labor 
collective to choose such an option of preferences that will 
allow the most qualified specialists to be brought into managing 
the enterprise undergoing privatization. In the event that they 
fulfill their economic obligations, they will be able to become, 
on a preferential basis, the owners of the controlling share of 
stock. 
  In addition, the State Privatization Program formalized a 
score of presidential, government, and departmental measures 
that provide preferential terms for exchanging vouchers for 
stock of enterprises undergoing privatization at voucher 
auctions, as well as the activities of voucher investment funds 
in the primary stock market--through tax preferences, by 
removing restrictions on formation of the controlling share of 
stock, and so on. Also among other important parts of the new 
program is the fact that it regulates the relations between 
enterprises' stockholders and their administration--until now 
there were no legislative acts protecting the right of small 
stockholders, despite the fact that 55 million persons already 
have become stock owners. But the main item is that the new 
State Privatization Program permits the ideologues of 
voucher-based privatization to completely control this process. 
Despite the fact that sectoral ministries have managed to expand 
the list of enterprises not subject to privatization from 30 to 
36 percent, supply at the primary stock market may be increased 
through the stock of enterprises potentially facing bankruptcy. 
At the same time, the document formalizes the supremacy of the 
federal program over regional ones, giving it a de facto status 
of a direct-action federal law. Anatoliy Chubays believes that 
the inclusion of this provision shows that the president 
considers the position of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov--one of the 
main opponents of the State Privatization Program and 
voucher-based privatization--unacceptable, and now local 
specifics will be taken into consideration in strict compliance 
with the state program. At the same time, the state program's 
authors built into it a number of measures aimed at stimulating 
privatization in the regions (in particular, the state program 
declares preferential financing for them). 
  At the same time, the state program formalizes the leading 
position of the GKI and the agencies it coordinates during the 
post-privatization period--first and foremost by attaching to 
privatization bodies the functions of development and 
implementation of enterprises' investment policy. This factor in 
the environment of investment shortage will enhance the GKI and 
its structures' influence on regions and enterprises. On the 
other hand, such a state of affairs will objectively contribute 
to strengthening the GKI's position in the government, which in 
the final count may result in neutralizing the current effective 
system of lobbying by sectoral ministries. It is possible that 
the GKI's desire to preserve its leading position in defining 
investment policy and protecting the emerging investment market 
from pressure on the part of the banking lobby (which so far has 
been successful in fending off implantation of foreign capital 
in their field) will turn out to be a decisive factor in 
limiting the banks' legal participation in privatization (until 
legal norms regulating activities of investment banks are 
introduced). At the same time, the State Privatization Program 
envisages especially favorable treatment for foreign investors 
regardless of their legal status. Apparently, this approach is 
meant to compensate for the risk that investing in the Russian 
economy entails. However, despite the proclaimed loyalty to 
foreign investors, the main active subjects in the investment 
market still will be specialized (voucher) investment funds, 
whose dominant position is the result not only of their social 
status but also of skilled cadres.

<H5>  Anatoliy Chubays on the Results of Privatization in 1993 </H5>
  --Political: There is no political force that 
could stop privatization in Russia.

are in private ownership; among them, of 14,000 large 
enterprises subject to privatization 11,000 have become 
joint-stock compamies. 
  --Social: Of 110 million Russians who have 
utilized their vouchers, 55 million became stockholders; 600 to 
800 voucher-based auctions are taking place every month. [End of

  --Authorization to sell an enterprise to a foreign investor 
in the event that he is the only participant in an auction, bid, 
or investment bid. 
  --Enabling foreign investors (on the basis of a government 
decision) to participate in the privatization of facilities and 
enterprises in the military-industrial and fuels and power 
generation complexes, as well as those engaged in mining and 
processing of strategic materials, precious metals, and stones.

the norms of distribution of revenue received from privatization 
upon taking into consideration the state of Russia's financial 
system, the state of the property market, and proposals 
submitted by appropriate privatization bodies. 
  --Revenue from privatization in the budgets at all levels 
must be directed at maintenance of social and household-oriented 
objects and financing of post-privatization support of 
enterprises.

<F P=106> [Article by Armen Khanbabyan: "Peace, Light, and a New </F>
Constitution, the President Promises in 1994"] 
  [Text] Levon Ter-Petrosyan's New Year's address was 
reminiscent more of a political speech than a holiday address. 
The president declared that the current extremely difficult 
situation left little room for optimism. But the situation would 
deteriorate even further unless the war in Karabakh were ended 
and the problem of the blockade resolved. According to the 
president, certain opportunities for the establishment of a 
long-term and firm armistice appeared at the end of the past 
year. Yerevan and Stepanakert agreed to the peacemaking 
initiatives of the CSCE and Russia. Azerbaijan rejected these 
initiatives, attempting to settle the problem militarily; 
nonetheless, the Armenian leader believes that before the end of 
the present year, Baku will have reached the conclusion of the 
futility of military pressure and of the need for compromise. 
According to Ter-Petrosyan, there is now hope that the year that 
has just begun will be one of peace. 
  The president termed the adoption of a new constitution a 
most important factor of the preservation of domestic political 
stability, expressing the hope here that it would be possible to 
adopt the Basic Law this year also. 
  Levon Ter-Petrosyan called the third task whose 
accomplishment in the very near future is inevitable the 
achievement of energy independence. The government is hoping for 
a resumption of the operation of the Armenian Nuclear Electric 
Power Station. As the president said, preliminary expert 
evaluations are promising, and there are all the prerequisites 
for the nuclear power station coming on stream as of the start 
of next winter. 
  If all that was promised in Ter-Petrosyan's address to the 
nation really comes to pass, 1994 could be considered a success. 
But in reality, circumstances could shape up somewhat 
differently. The termination of Russian assistance and regional 
neighbors' abrupt obstruction on the question of a resumption of 
the operation of the nuclear power station could put back 
fulfillment of the dream of energy independence for an 
indefinitely long period of time. It would be extremely 
difficult under present conditions to cope in isolation with 
this technically very complex task, which requires, in addition, 
considerable foreign currency investments. The adoption of a new 
constitution could drag on also, inasmuch as parliament is not 
disposed to rush this matter--this would mean, after all, early 
parliamentary elections, about which a large part of the 
people's elect thinks with fear and trembling. 
  It is possible that the hopes for peace could be realized, 
it 
is true, but not, most likely, thanks to the efforts of the 
international community of Russia or Iran, of which Armenia 
recently requested mediation in the conflict. The situation in 
Karabakh today is reminiscent of the situation that took shape 
following Abulfaz Elchibey's assumption of power. At that time 
the Azerbaijani leader succeeded, using Russian mercenaries, in 
breaking the resistance of the inadequately trained self-defense 
detachments and in occupying roughly half the territory of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. But the people of Karabakh held their 
ground and in time not only retrieved what they had lost, but 
also settled many questions of their security, pushing back the 
front a considerable distance from Stepanakert and other 
localities of their republic. Major defeats destabilized the 
situation in Baku and played a decisive part in Elchibey's 
departure from the political arena. 
  Today Geydar Aliyev is continuing to increase the pressure 
on 
Karabakh. In two weeks of fighting, Azerbaijani formations 
reinforced by detachments of Russian mercenaries and Afghan 
mojahedin have already lost over 700 men killed and a 
considerable quantity of armor. But they have yet to accomplish 
a single tactical assignment in a single sector of the front. 
And this despite the vigorous activity of guard detachments 
composed mainly of Chechens executing retreating forces, both 
Azerbaijanis and Russian mercenaries. In addition, the savage 
pre-New Year's shelling in the border areas of Armenia have 
provoked the increased offensive activity of the Karabakh people 
themselves, and the situation has in places today once again 
begun to shape up to the disadvantage of the Azerbaijani Army, 
which again runs the risk of losing the strategic initiative. 
Such a development of events in the future could represent a 
great danger for Geydar Aliyev. An endeavor to escape the fate 
of his predecessor could force the present Azerbaijani leader to 
begin to move toward compromise. If this does happen, it will 
not, however, be before spring, when it will finally be clear 
that on this occasion also the blockade and the severe winter 
difficulties have not changed the situation in Armenia.

<F P=106> [Article by Ashot Aramyan: "Further and Further Away From </F>
Harmony: `Empty Pockets--Empty Stores'--Such Is the Current 
Situation in the Consumer Market"] 
  [Text] The situation in the republic consumer market is, to 
be honest, less than attractive. The lack of sufficient 
resources in Russian rubles and other foreign hard currency is 
beginning to show. Many merchants, having earned these days 
their first thousands of drams, have encountered difficulties 
converting them to other currency and....closed their stores. 
Elbow-shoving queues form in state-owned stores, where the 
supply of goods is minimal. People are indignant that butter 
priced at 25 drams and sugar at 10 drams have been designated 
for unrestricted sale rather than being sold by rationing 
coupons. Let us point out, however, that these complaints are 
unfair, since the available quantity of these goods clearly was 
not enough to distribute them to the entire population through 
coupons. In some instances, however, both store employees and 
members of law enforcement also violate the rules of trading, 
creating chaos and confusion in the lines. This is doubly 
impermissible, since right now backing up the dram with 
available goods is a political as well as economic action. 
  There also is a clear discrepancy, imbalance, between the 
official exchange rates of currencies set by the Central Bank 
(for instance, 15 drams for one U.S. dollar) and the "black 
market" rates, which are, it should be pointed out, more 
realistic (25-30 drams for a dollar). The banks, which are 
experiencing a shortage of foreign currency, set restrictions on 
sales of hard currency, trying to artificially hold down its 
exchange rate and not allow the dram to weaken. Wherever hard 
currency is sold at the official rate, colossal lines form 
immediately. 
  Meanwhile, and precisely for the aforementioned reasons, 
prices rise continuously. While during the first days of the 
money exchange, Magna cigarettes could be purchased for 5 drams, 
and then later for 8-10 drams, now at this price, if one is very 
lucky, one can count only on Turkish cigarettes of a quality 
that is lower by an order of magnitude. Butter went from costing 
45 drams a kilogram to 80-120 drams, and sugar--from 15 to 30. 
  If the difficulties with the internal convertibility of the 
Armenian currency continue, before the year is out the republic 
may get its third bout of hyperinflation in so many months, 
empty store shelves, and total impoverishment of the population. 
  With all the shortcomings in organizing the sales of butter 
and sugar reserved for the state trade network, I think that 
prices for these products will not gallop for a while. The 
government also should take immediate steps to organize pre-New 
Year sales of the greatest number of goods possible by coupons: 
this could bring down panic buying, and reduce the intense 
pressure on the consumer market. 
  Under socialism, the cheerless scheme of the consumer market 
workings looked this way: there is money but no goods. At the 
initial stage of a transition to market relations, the picture 
changed dramatically: the population no longer has any money, 
while everything one can imagine in one's most wonderful dream 
has now appeared in the stores at high prices. Now the situation 
has become even more dramatic: empty pockets and empty stores. 
Are we moving further away from harmony?

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary </F>
Arman Kirakosyan, a first deputy minister of foreign affairs of 
the Republic of Armenia, by unidentified RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA 
correspondent; place and date not given: "Relations Within the 
Framework of the CIS Are Among Our Foreign Policy Priorities"] 
  [Text] 
  [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] Mr. Kirakosyan, among the foreign 
policy issues that fall within your job responsibilities, 
relations with CIS countries are of considerable importance. 
From this standpoint, our readers would be interested to know 
how our relations with these countries are organized and 
developing, first and foremost with Russia, since we have to 
acknowledge that any event in Russia in one way or the other 
reverberates in the Republic of Armenia, especially affecting 
its internal and foreign state of affairs. 
  [Kirakosyan] That is, of course, a very broadly defined 
question. Nevertheless, I will try to provide an exhaustive 
answer and, naturally, I will start with the Russian Federation. 
  Today, when international relations are in a period of 
transition and a trend is in the making toward the creation and 
development of more new unions, including a broad process of 
cooperation on a mutually beneficial basis, Armenia assigns a 
priority to Russia in its foreign policy. In its relations with 
the countries in the region, the Russian leadership is 
unquestionable. 
  Now the period of defining the positions of the two states 
with respect to each other seems to be behind us, and we finally 
have come to a mutual understanding. I especially want to draw 
your attention to the fact that we have to approach the process 
of bilateral relations between Armenia and Russia seriously. 
  In the current situation, it is important to coordinate 
foreign, economic, social, military, and domestic policy in the 
direction of leading the republic out of the economic and energy 
crisis, which will ensure external and internal political 
equilibrium and a successful course of economic transformations. 
  In our relations with the Russian Federation, we base our 
actions first and foremost on the national and state interests 
of Armenia, which are aimed at economic development on a 
mutually beneficial basis. 
  Diplomatic relations between the Russian Federation and the 
Republic of Armenia were established in April 1992. President of 
the Russian Federation B. Yeltsin on 26 May 1992 appointed V. 
Stupishin as ambassador plenipotentiary and extraordinary in 
Armenia. Before that, on 29 December 1991, an agreement between 
Armenia and Russia, "On Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual 
Security," was signed in Moscow. 
  The Republic of Armenia has trade and economic agreements 
with the Russian Federation for 1992-1993. In addition, we have 
signed more than 30 other agreements with the Russian 
Federation, and a number of projects are in the development 
stage. All of this overall must help to create favorable 
conditions for market relations between Armenia and Russia, with 
the aim of preserving and developing existing economic ties, 
drawing on already signed agreements on coordinating the actions 
in the development of the fuels and power generation sector, 
industry, transportation, communications, and so on. 
  Thus, we can say with certainty that the Republic of Armenia 
does not have as intensive and comprehensive ties with any 
foreign country as it has with the Russian Federation. It is 
quite obvious that in the Republic of Armenia's foreign policy, 
Russia occupies an important place. And this is logical, since 
it reflects the trends and traditions that exist between our 
countries and peoples. 
  Now let us look at the factors that stand in the way of 
developing Armenian-Russian relations. 
  For a variety of reasons, economic ties between the Republic 
of Armenia and the Russian Federation are currently noticeably 
disrupted; nevertheless, fluctuations in the political and 
economic life of Russia echo in our republic. The latest 
confirmation of this is freeing prices for bread and fuel, an 
unexpected exchange of the USSR State Bank and the Central Bank 
of the Russian Federation banknotes of 1961-1992 issue, and so 
forth. 
  One should assume that the existing close economic ties 
between the two states are a long-term factor, which is to a 
considerable degree necessitated by the absence of appropriate 
alternative infrastructures, and this circumstance must be taken 
into account in developing the foreign policy course of the 
Republic of Armenia. 
  Alas, we have not yet made the effective steps that need to 
be made in the sphere of developing relations with the Russian 
Federation. A Republic of Armenia Embassy still has not been 
opened in Moscow, which, naturally, would be appropriate for the 
current stage of development of bilateral relations. The current 
form of Armenian representation in Russia corresponds only to a 
small extent to international norms and logic-dictated relations 
existing between independent states. Its functional disparity 
currently does not afford us the ability fully to conduct 
relations with embassies of other countries in the world, the 
number of which in Moscow equals the number of these countries' 
representations in the United Nations. Such things as monitoring 
the implementation of previously signed agreements and treaties, 
as well as the analysis of promising projects aimed at further 
deepening and expansion of Armenian-Russian relations, not to 
mention the enormous opportunities to stimulate the republic's 
economy, remain outside the activities of the permanent 
representation. Creation of consular representations of the 
Republic of Armenia in important key points of the Russian 
Federation also is progressing slowly. Moreover, a wrong trend 
is developing in the matter of forming representations: we base 
our decisions on the assumption that representations are needed 
first and foremost in places where the greatest number of 
Armenians live, so that we can resolve their problems in Russia. 
This undoubtedly is an important task. We should not forget, 
however, that the main task of representations is not in working 
with the [Armenian] community--it is in facilitating the 
development of relations between the Russian Federation and the 
Republic of Armenia, in particular, in those areas where the 
community has a certain economic, political, and social 
potential. 
  Speaking of the need for the fastest possible creation of 
legal and treaty foundations for multilateral cooperation, which 
could have a decisive influence in leading us out of the 
economic and energy crisis, we should pay attention to the 
actual ratification by our Supreme Council of a number of 
bilateral agreements and treaties. Among them is a fundamental 
document--the agreement between the Republic of Armenia and the 
Russian Federation "On Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual 
Security." 
  In our opinion, the next factor is the influence of the 
Russian Federation, which, both within the framework of 
undertakings of the UN and CSCE and by its direct participation, 
could play a perceptibly positive role in the resolution of the 
Karabakh crisis. The deepening and development of comprehensive 
relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Russian 
Federation may help to establish good-neighbor relations between 
Armenia and the countries with which it shares borders. 
  As to the CIS' inter-state structure, almost all its 
members, 
including the Russian Federation and the Republic of Armenia, 
want a qualitatively new level for the CIS, a single economic 
and cultural space. 
  In this context, development of relations with all CIS 
countries is as important as of those with Russia. This should 
include both restoration of economic, social, and cultural ties 
and development of relations with the Baltic countries. 
  [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] How are our relations developing with 
the countries of the East-European part of the 
Commonwealth--Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova? 
  [Kirakosyan] The absence of active relations with these 
states also is the result of our rather inflexible approach. 
However, lately the state of affairs has improved markedly in 
this respect, too. For instance, in February of this year we 
opened a diplomatic representation of the Republic of Armenia in 
Kiev; we are preparing a visit of the Armenian president to 
Ukraine, where a large package of important documents will be 
signed. 
  Finally, diplomatic relations have been established with the 
Republic of Belarus. We will soon set up a diplomatic 
representation in Minsk; an interim charge d'affairs of the 
Republic of Armenia has been appointed to the Republic of 
Belarus. We are working on mutually beneficial treaties and 
agreements. 
  "Armenia-Ukraine" and "Armenia-Belarus" societies have been 
established in Yerevan; they are engaged in strengthening 
friendly ties between our peoples. 
  We still have a long way to go with respect to Moldova. We 
have established close trade and economic relations with it. 
However, for a variety of reasons, we cannot yet speak of 
comprehensive relations. 
  [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] Mr. Kirakosyan, in your opinion, does 
not the new Economic Union hamper the independent development of 
CIS countries? 
  [Kirakosyan] Meetings among the prime ministers of three 
Slavic republics--the Russian Federation, the Republic of 
Belarus, and Ukraine--have taken place lately; these meetings 
were marked by active discussions. As a result of negotiations, 
a joint statement has been signed on urgent measures with 
respect to acceleration of economic integration. 
  In connection with this agreement, opinions have been voiced 
that the CIS has not lived up to expectations, and that by 
taking this step, the stronger Slavic states are trying to shed 
the less developed members. 
  Commenting on the results of this meeting, I can say that 
this is a logical step which does not contradict the idea of the 
CIS. Moreover, this step was taken further to its logical 
conclusion by the three Slavic states in Moscow, at the 
conference of heads of CIS states (which took place in the end 
of September of this year), where an agreement was signed to 
create the Economic Union, whose purpose is to serve only one 
practical goal--creating a single market. Such a union has 
become a necessity, since the former USSR republics can sell 
most of their output only to one another, and in many instances 
can produce the final product only with the help of one another. 
  The creation of such a union is logical; it is happening in 
other regions of the world as well and does not in any way 
hamper the independent development of CIS countries or keep them 
from establishing and strengthening independent economic 
relations with some or other country. 
  This union in the future envisages a great volume of work 
both inside the CIS and in bilateral relations. In particular, 
the parties to the agreement must ensure the compatibility of 
taxation systems, establish visa-free travel, and so on. 
  Accepting the necessity of unified guiding principles of 
economic relations, they expressed a willingness to bring 
national legal codes into conformity with the criteria of the 
aforementioned agreement and international law. It is also 
envisaged to create joint bodies of administration, while 
decisions affecting the Economic Union will be adopted only on 
the basis of consensus. 
  [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] What is your appraisal of our 
relations 
with Transcaucasus states? 
  [Kirakosyan] The Transcaucasus region is in the center of 
special attention. It is no secret that the security and 
well-being of Armenia and the Armenian people depend to a large 
extent on the situation that exists in this region, on the 
correlation of different forces and interests, relations with 
Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Iran. Bilateral relations with 
neighboring countries are important. In this respect, it is hard 
to overestimate the place and role of Georgia. 
  We need today to rethink Armenian-Georgian relations from 
the 
standpoint of national and state interests. First of all, we 
should not forget about the more than half-million-strong 
Armenian diaspora in Georgia, whose fate concerns us today. We 
hope that the current authorities in Georgia will conduct a 
farsighted policy of goodwill with respect to their citizens of 
Armenian descent. 
  Much has been said about vitally important communications 
that go through the territory of Georgia. I only want to add 
that all transit shipping, including petroleum products and gas, 
is being done on a mutually profitable basis. Unfortunately, it 
is for this reason that the explanation for the frequent 
robberies on transportation and the explosions on the gas 
pipeline most likely lies in the instability and 
crime-engendering situation inside Georgia than in its "ill 
intents." When the region becomes relatively stable, an equal 
level of our countries' economic development will finally allow 
us in the future to cooperate in the sphere of joint production 
and distribution of products and may in the future lead to the 
desired economic integration. 
  In particular, a serious legal basis has been established 
for 
us to develop our relations along civilized lines. As is known, 
during the meetings of heads of our states and governments (in 
May and June of this year), about 30 treaties and agreements 
were signed, including a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and 
Mutual Security; an Inter-State Declaration of Economic 
Cooperation; agreements on transit freight shipping, as well as 
on cultural, scientific, and humanitarian cooperation; and other 
documents. Each party set up government commissions to 
coordinate their implementation. 
  The continuing political instability; the deepening of 
Abkhazian-Georgian confrontation; and a certain polarity of 
opinions regarding the ways to settle it--this is how, 
unfortunately, we have to characterize the existing situation in 
Georgia. 
  In these extreme conditions, several months ago an Armenian 
Embassy was opened in Georgia, whose task is to serve the cause 
of further development of Armenian-Georgian relations. There are 
four diplomats working there, headed by an interim charge 
d'affairs. A number of organizational issues with respect to 
ensuring normal work of the diplomatic representation have been 
resolved. The embassy was able to launch active work on 
resolving the tasks set for it; close relations have been 
established with the bodies of authority in the republic, as 
well as with diplomatic representations accredited in Georgia. 
They inform the Republic of Armenia's Ministry of Foreign 
Relations in a timely manner on the events in the neighboring 
republic, present their forecasts, and submit proposals aimed at 
resolving emerging problems and developing relations between our 
countries. 
  Many people are currently worried about the prospects for 
future relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, especially 
considering that the latter now has become a CIS member. I want 
to say right away that our republic had no objections to 
Azerbaijan's joining the CIS, and expressed hope that this 
circumstance will become a stimulus for a peaceful resolution of 
the Karabakh issue, the problem that represents the only 
obstacle on the road of normal neighborly relations between 
sovereign independent states. However, the latest events show 
that the shortsighted, obstructionist actions of Azerbaijan's 
current authorities do not leave any hope for achieving peace in 
the near future. Numerous official statements by Yerevan and 
Stepanakert and their foreign policy agencies, their acceptance 
of a new cease-fire schedule, are proof of the desire on the 
part of Karabakh to cease military actions. 
  We support the peacekeeping efforts of the UN and the CSCE, 
as well as government, state, and public figures of a number of 
states, who have taken upon themselves an important mission--the 
fair resolution of the problem and establishing peace in our 
region. 
  [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] How are our relations with Central 
Asian states developing? 
  [Kirakosyan] After the collapse of the Soviet empire, 
Central 
Asia began to attract major powers of the world like a magnet. 
The United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Great 
Britain, as well as Korea, India and Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and 
a number of other states, began to fish for their "miracle fish" 
in Central Asian soil, which holds fabulous wealth. 
  Armenia also has its own direct interests in this region. As 
is known, we still get our gas from Turkmenistan. We are, of 
course, interested in the oil and grain, metals, cotton, and 
relatively cheap food that the Central Asian states have in 
abundance. Of course, had the roads been open, the situation 
would have been different, since these states also are 
interested in a number of goods produced in Armenia--electric 
bulbs, electric motors, cable, chemicals, cognac and wine, 
various technologies, electronic equipment, and so on. Through 
the territory of Armenia, Central Asian states have a gateway to 
Turkey (and from there on to Europe), as well as to Black Sea 
ports. Armenia, in turn, through the Central Asian states would 
have a gateway to the countries of Southeast Asia and the Far 
East. As you can see, our relations with the Central Asian 
republics are no less important. These relations are not always 
smooth: old traditions are still strong in these states, and 
they exert a strong influence in the sphere of state and 
economic management. 
  Over the past year, we have established diplomatic relations 
with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The 
aforementioned and a number of other reasons still keep 
Uzbekistan from establishing diplomatic relations in accordance 
with international norms not only with Armenia, but also with 
other CIS states. Uzbekistan is the only state of the former 
USSR with which Armenia still has not established diplomatic 
relations (actually, with exception of Azerbaijan). 
  With Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, we have signed protocols 
on 
cooperation between ministries of foreign affairs. Finally, we 
signed long-term inter-state agreements with Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan (with the latter during the recent 
visit of President L. Ter-Petrosyan). Dozens of economic 
agreements and treaties have been signed and are operating at 
different levels. The Embassy of the Republic of Armenia has 
already been functioning in the capital of Kazakhstan, Almaty, 
for several months. The interim charge d'affairs of the Republic 
of Armenia at the same time represents our state's interests in 
Bishkek. The embassy at this point has a minimal staff, but it 
already is working actively. 
  We plan to open an embassy in Ashgabat before the end of the 
year. 
  In short, we have a lot of things to do in the future, and I 
can say that the Central Asian region will always remain at the 
center of our attention.
