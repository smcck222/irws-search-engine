Telesh, N.P. Finogenova, Zoology Institute at Russia's Academy

  [Abstract] Concerns that the 22.2 km dam and flood 
protection barriers along the St. Petersburg sea front will 
aggravate the already strained environmental conditions in the 
Neva bay and eastern end of the Gulf of Finland necessitated a 
comprehensive evaluation of the bay's hydrobiological 
characteristics. To this end, staff of the Fresh Water and 
Experimental Hydrobiology Laboratory of the Zoology Institute at 
Russia's Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg carried out 
hydrobiological research aimed at clarifying the bay ecosystem 
functioning. In so doing, the phytoplankton and chlorophyll 
concentrations are studied on the basis of the 1984-1989 and 
1992 data; the phytoplankton sedimentation samples are processed 
using conventional hydrobiological procedures, and the 
chlorophyll concentration is measured in acetone extracts with 
the help of a spectrophotometer. The sampling procedure is 
outlined. The findings reveal that the Neva river estuary is 
characterized by a twin-peak seasonal phytoplankton dynamics 
curve with the aquatic plant biomass maximum of up to 15 mg/l in 
the spring. The blue-green, green, and diatom algae are dominant 
during the summer and fall period. The average zooplankton 
population and biomass in the Neva river bay in June of 1984 and 
1991, Shannon's diversity index in the oligochete colonies in 
various sections of the Neva bay, and the oligochete biomass in 
the Neva bay are summarized. The study of the hydrobiont colony 
structure and functioning reveals that the significant changes 
which occurred during the 1984-1991 period reflect the 
continuing water contamination and changes in the hydrological 
conditions which are attributed to seawall construction. The 
need for further long-term systematic observations and a special 
estuary ecosystem monitoring program is stressed. A negative 
trend whereby research budgets are being cut is noted. The 
prerequisites for stabilizing the environmental conditions in 
the Ladoga, Neva, Neva bay, and Gulf of Finland system are 
formulated. Figures 5; tables 3; references 17.

  [Abstract] The high morbidity, primarily acute respiratory 
organ disease (OZOD), characterizing adaptation to the 
conditions in Eastern Siberia and the viral bronchial-pulmonary 
pathology factors whereby the mononuclear phagocyte system (SMF) 
serves as the central mechanism of the organism's immunity and 
nonspecific resistance engendered interest in the functional 
activity and nonspecific antiviral resistance of mononuclear 
phagocytes to the climatic conditions in Eastern Siberia. A 
study involved 18-23 year old men who came in November-December 
from USSR's European part to work in Trans-Baykal; the sample 
consisted of 135 patients divided into three groups and a 
control group of 46 men. The functional activity of monocytes 
was examined in an integral test with tetrazole nitro blue. The 
experimental procedure is outlined. The functional activity of 
monocytes among newcomers suffering from acute respiratory organ 
diseases and the nonspecific antiviral cell resistance to acute 
respiratory organ diseases among the newcomers are summarized. 
The study demonstrated that adaptation to the conditions of 
Eastern Siberia is related to changes in the functional activity 
of monocytes and intracellular virusemia in monocytes and 
lymphocytes but revealed no significant changes in the metabolic 
and phagocytic activity of monocytes during acute pneumonia and 
bronchitis whereby the degree of viral damage to monocytes 
serves as the determining factor. The antiviral monocyte 
resistance indicators are the most significant adaptation 
criteria. Tables 2; references 10.

  [Abstract] Interest in the state of water in biological 
systems under deep cooling and a lack of systematic studies of 
the effect of various types of cryoprotectors on water's 
nonfreezing component in the cells prompted an attempt to 
determine experimentally the quantity of nonfreezing water in a 
suspension of Yersinia pestis EV76 cells in the 
presence of both penetrating and nonpenetrating cryoprotectors 
and study the process of this component congelation with a 
decrease in the specimen temperature. The Y. pestis 
EV76 plague microbe is selected mostly due to the fact that 
preparation of the Y. pestis EV76 vaccine strain 
involves freezing in a protective medium and lyophilic drying. 
The Y. pestis EV76 vaccine strain of the NIIEG line 
is used in the experiment. The bacteria were grown on a solid 
nutrient medium at a 28ÎC temperature for 48 h. The 
experimental procedure is outlined. Nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectra were recorded by a BS 567 A high resolution Tesla 
spectrometer at a 100 MHz working proton frequency. The 
dependence of the NMR water signal strength on the temperature 
in the suspension of Y. pestis EV76 cells without and 
with a cryoprotector and in a system containing bacterial cells 
and the temperature curves of the cryoptotectant solutions are 
plotted. The dependence of the nonfrozen water NMR signal 
strength on the temperature in the Y. pestis EV76 
bacteria suspensions and in various cryoprotector media and the 
phase transition and congelation temperatures in cryoprotective 
media under various cooling and heating conditions are 
summarized. The study carried out within a 0 to -40ÎC 
temperature range with the help of the differential scanning 
calorimetry method reveals that the total amount of nonfreezing 
water within a range between congelation and melting points in 
cell suspensions with various cryoprotectors does not follow the 
simple additivity law with respect to the sum of hydration 
numbers of individual components. The findings attest to the 
complex effect of multicomponent protective media on the state 
of water's nonfreezing fraction in cell suspensions and point 
toward the possibility of producing material in a congealed 
state. This makes it necessary to determine the waster state at 
low temperatures experimentally in each specific case and in 
developing cryobiological practices, yet the congelation 
temperatures found in the study can be used for selecting 
optimum long-term Y. pestis EV76 cell specimen 
storage temperatures. Figures 2; tables 2; references 10: 8

  [Abstract] A lack of clear understanding of the specific 
role of the inhibitory system in the GABA-ergic system 
involvement in the development of neurological diseases 
manifested in seizures and paroxysms and a lack of data on 
whether the pre- or postsynaptic system participates in the 
mediated effect of NAD on the GABA-ergic transmission whereby 
nicotinamide competes for the benzodiadepin binding segments 
through NAD and reinforces the GABA-ergic system prompted an 
attempt to answer these questions. To this end, an experiment 
was carried out on 120-150 g male rats which were injected with 
nicotinamide intraperitoneally based on a 150 mg per 1 kg ratio 
twice a day for one week. Corazol was administered to control 
animals or against the backdrop of 30 mg/kg nicotinamide 
injection 50 s prior to decapitation. The experimental procedure 
is outlined. The NAD and _g_-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
concentration in the rat brain cortex, the effect of NAD on the 
dynamics of [.sup]14[/]C-GABA binding by control animal 
synaptosomes, the effect of NAD on the dynamics of [.sup]14[/] 
C-GABA binding synaptosomes after a corazol 
injection, and the curve of [.sup]14[/]C-GABA release by the 
synaptosomes are plotted. The findings show that 
convulsion-inducing drug injection to intact animals leads to a 
NAD and GABA level decrease by 23 and 20% even 50 s after 
the 
start of seizures whereby this effect is not observed after the 
additional nicotinamide injection. The study reveals and NAD 
concentrations triggering the inhibitory effect on GABA 
accumulation by the synaptosomes have no effect on GABA release. 
The conclusion is drawn that systematic administration of 
nicotinamide accompanied by an increase in the NAD and GABA 
level helps to restore the postsynaptic inhibitory effect of 
GABA under stress. Moreover, the effect of NAD on the GABA-ergic 
transmission is primarily realized at the postsynaptic level 
according to data on the impact of NAD on the inhibitory 
neurotransmitter binding and release systems. Figures 5; 
references 18: 3 Russian, 15 Western.

  [Abstract] The catalytic activity of 5'-nucleotidase 
(5'-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase), a lipid-dependent enzyme 
of the cell plasmatic membrane, which is manifested in 
hydrolyzing extracellular AMP and the formation of extracellular 
adenosine, and the properties of bradykinin--a vasoactive 
peptide capable of stimulating the thymus cell division and 
inhibiting the thymocyte membrane lipid peroxidation--whose 
effect on the state of tumor cells is relatively unknown 
prompted an investigation into the activity of the thymus and 
tumor cell 5'-nucleotidase after bradykinin injection to mice 
during the development of allogenic and syngenic transplanted 
tumors with different proliferation stimulant effects. To this 
end, BALB/c and noninbred 18-22 g mice were used in the 
experiment. The former mice were inoculated with P-815 
macrocytoma (syngenic for the H-2D hystocompatibility complex) 
while the latter were subcutaneously injected with allogenic 
Crocker sarcoma. Bradykinin triacetate was administered 
intravenously after seven days to both groups. The 
5'-nucleotidase activity was measured by the inorganic phosphate 
formation as a result of the 5'-AMP hydrolysis. The experimental 
procedure is outlined. The 5'-nucleotidase activity in the mice 
thymus after the bradykinin injection and the number of tumoral 
node cells after the bradykinin injection at the tumor 
development stage are summarized, and the activity of thymus and 
tumor cell 5'-nucleotidase after the bradykinin injection to 
tumor-bearing mice is plotted. Bradykinin injection to intact 
mice leads to a considerable increase in the thymus cell 
5'-nucleotidase activity, peaking after 6 h; the effect of the 
bradykinin injection on the allogenic and syngenic tumors 
differed. The study shows that bradykinin stimulates the 
5'-nucleotidase activity in the thymus of tumor-bearing mice 
while the effect of bradykinin on the tumor cell enzyme activity 
is less marked, especially under syngenic conditions. It is 
noted that the 5'-nucleotidase activity is a rather informative 
indicator of the thymus cell status which characterizes the 
tumor cell sensitivity to bradykinin. The study of the 
5'-nucleotidase activity may be used for assessing the effect of 
antitumoral preparations under experimental conditions. Figures

  [Abstract] Reports of changes in the hematoencephalic 
barrier (GEB) permeability and the appearance of neurospecific 
proteins (NSB) in the blood accompanied by the formation of 
antibodies which threaten the brain with an autoimmune 
impairment and the impact of protein-synthesizing process 
activation in the glial cell on the performance of the 
protective mechanisms aimed at alleviating possible pathological 
consequences against the background of a rise in the 
hematoencephalic barrier permeability prompted an attempt to 
verify the above assumptions. To this end, the dynamics of the 
specific glial proteins and antibodies to them in the blood of 
patients after neurosurgery are studied. To this end, 23 
patients divided into two groups--14 with a verified brain tumor 
(principal group) and 9 in the control group--aged 35 to 45 are 
examined. The anesthetic procedure and research methodology are 
outlined. Brain _a_[.sub]1[/]- and 
_a_[.sub]2[/]-globulines, _a_[.sub]2[/]-glycoproteid, 
gliofibrillary antigen, and antibodies to them were examined; 
the number of neurospecific proteins and autoantibodies to them 
were determined by immunoferent methods and recorded by a 
multispectral Titerteck Multiskan spectrophotometer (by Flow, 
U.K.). Statistical data are processed using the 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric criteria. The neurospecific 
protein concentration in the blood of the principal and control 
groups against the background of anaesthesia and during the 
postoperative period is summarized. A high neurospecific protein 
level is measured in the blood of most of the principal group 
patients during the preoperative period; it is speculated that 
the antiendematic drugs used before the surgery facilitated an 
increase in the hematoencephalic barrier permeability. Similar 
results were obtained in the control group. The conclusion is 
drawn that anaesthesia is the leading factor affecting an 
increase in the hematoencephalic barrier permeability to 
neurospecific proteins in the bloodbrain direction whereby 
the neurospecific protein dynamics make it possible to speculate 
that the glial protein synthesis is enhanced under the effect of 
anaesthesia. It cannot be ruled out that a massive neurospecific 
protein influx into biological fluids against the backdrop of 
dehydrating therapy, alcohol intake, neurolepsy, and traumatic 
brain injury generate the protective response preventing the 
autoimmune brain impairment. Tables 2; references 11: 3 Russian,

  [Abstract] The consequences of disruptions in the 
functioning of the brain's GABA-ergic system, such as epilepsy, 
Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, etc., reports confirming the 
so-called _g_-aminobutyric acid (GABA) hypothesis of epilepsy 
and convulsive paroxysms, and the findings indicating that some 
NAD-dependent dehydrogenases can lower the nicotinamide 
coenzymes in the blood prompted an examination of the 
anticonvulsant mechanism of nicotinamide and to investigate the 
response of the principal inhibitory mediating system to the 
effect of NAD. To this end, an experiment was carried out on 150 
g male albino rats, and corazol was injected intraperitoneally 
based on a ratio of 30 mg per 1 kg of body weight 50 s, 2 and 10 
min, and 3 h before decapitation. The experimental procedure is 
outlined. The effect of MAD on the specific [.sup]3[/] 
H-muscimol binding is summarized, and the dynamics 
of [.sup]14[/]C-GABA capture by the rat brain synaptosomes 
are plotted. Allowing for known data on the nicotinamide 
interaction with the GABA-benzodiazepin receptor complex and the 
findings of this study, the conclusion is drawn that the 
pharmacological effect of nicotinamide used for clinical 
treatment of epileptic seizures may be realized through NAD 
which activates the GABA receptors, thus facilitating the 
GABA-ergic transmission. In affecting the terminal stage of 
postsynaptic action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, NAD is 
capable of inhibiting the synaptosomal capture of [.sup]14[/] 
C-GABA just like the capture inhibitors which are 
efficient anticonvulsant drugs. Figures 3; tables 1; references

<F P=106> [Interview with Doctor of Economic Sciences and Russian </F>
Federation First Deputy Minister of Science and Technical Policy 
Andrey Georgiyevich Fonotov, by Svetlana Fedorovich, under the 
rubric ``Opinions''; place and date not given: ``Andrey Fonotov: 
The Primary Thing Under Present Conditions Is To Create a New 
Institutional Environment''--first paragraph is SEGODNYA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Andrey Georgiyevich Fonotov was born in 1947 in 
Leningrad. He graduated from the Economics Faculty of Moscow 
State University imeni Lomonosov. He is a doctor of economic 
sciences. For a long time he worked at the TsEMI (Central 
Institute of Mathematical Economics, where Glazyev, Gaydar, and 
Shatalin worked). He is the author of more than 100 works and 
books on questions of planning, forecasting, and the theory of 
scientific and technical progress. At present he is RF [Russian 
Federation] First Deputy Minister of Science and Technical 
Policy. 
  Fedorovich: Andrey Georgiyevich, what is the 
Ministry of Science and Technical Policy for you personally? Is 
the new name of the former State Committee for Science and 
Technology merely the copying of some western models or is an 
entirely specific meaning incorporated in this? 
  Fonotov: Well, in general the existence of such a 
ministry is not entirely typical of the West, although it does 
exist in England, France, and the FRG, but not, for example, in 
the United States. Following Russian traditions, any socially 
significant function is not realized until it has been 
institutionalized. Any public movement or organization, for 
example, a ministry, can be an institution. Many of our best 
minds, among them Karamzin, Solovyev, and Klyuchevskiy, back in 
the 19th century noted that in Russia progress always came from 
above. P.N. Milyukov asserted that the government in our country 
was more progressive than the people for certain reasons, 
history points to this, the facts testify to this. So today the 
ministry of science, if we talk about its specific tasks, is 
called upon to create a new environment, in which the scientific 
community should function. People often call me an 
institutionalist, but, believe me, my conviction is based on 
rather specific things. In the future the main goal is not only 
to support scientific directions, to plan priorities, as is done 
at times, or to chose the directions that are most important 
from the standpoint of the national economy, although all this 
is an indispensable condition of the activity of the ministry. 
The primary thing under present conditions is to create a new 
institutional environment. And the future of Russian science 
actually depends on how successfully we accomplish this task. 
  Fedorovich: Does technical policy today consist 
precisely in this? 
  Fonotov: Yes, because under stable conditions, 
when normal institutions, which determine the functioning of one 
sphere or activity or another, have already been established, 
all the above-named problems are solved as if automatically in 
the process of the routine activity of the corresponding 
institutions. 
  Fedorovich: Well, we are starting from scratch.... 
  Fonotov: If you consider that a few years ago 
market institutions were included on the list of mortal sins, we 
need the ministry. But this is, so to speak, one aspect. But the 
other aspect is that we always had a kind of idea, which was 
given by Marx, about the laws of socioeconomic development. 
There were so-called formations, there were modes of production, 
they replaced each other in succession, while the Bolsheviks 
were distinguished from all the others by the fact that they 
were the first to realize in what kind of system they were 
living and determined the levers, which it is possible to 
actuate in order to speed up in the interests of mankind the 
replacement of some formations with others. In reality this, as 
in science in general, is merely one of the possible hypotheses 
of the development of society, moreover, as experience shows, a 
very approximate hypothesis. There can be many such hypotheses. 
Therefore, it is strange when people say that Marxist science is 
the only true science.... 
  Fedorovich: And it is omnipotent, because it is 
true.... 
  Fonotov: Precisely. For some people it is. But for 
some people it is false. Such a Marxist love triangle with 
science at the base. But if we speak seriously, the approach 
based on types of development seems more adequate to me. I have 
attempted to formulate a certain hypothesis--I need to do some 
more work on it in order for it to be confirmed--which states, 
in particular, that somewhere at the turn between the 17th and 
18th centuries mankind passed from stagnant, random development 
to the innovation, or evolutionary, type. How does society today 
differ from what we had several centuries ago? We consciously 
cultivate innovations. Vernadskiy has an excellent illustration 
of this: All the basic achievements of mankind--the wheel, fire, 
the compass, paper--do not have authorship, because they were 
developed by people, who did not find themselves in the course 
of civilization and were somewhere on the periphery of human 
development. At that time completely different forces and 
different people were the motive forces of civilization. But 
today we ourselves are artificial, and our problems are 
problems, to which man himself has given rise. And in order to 
survive somehow in this system, we should cultivate what is new 
all the time. It is no secret that the basic institutions of 
modern society were introduced to Russian soil from outside. I 
defined such a type of development--survival at any price--as 
the mobilization type. Precisely for this reason the planting of 
market relations for us is not simply the problem of, say, 
developing the same institutions: All the same the mobilization 
and innovation types of development differ completely. A 
mobilization economy, in particular, cannot even be called an 
economy, since in it the criterion of efficiency or economy is 
completely absent. Only the enormous expending of inefficient 
labor takes place. The best means of getting rid of the defects 
and drawbacks of the mobilization type is the switch to the 
innovation type of development. For this it is necessary to 
reform fundamentally all the spheres of our society and to 
change in principle its reproduction mechanisms. 
  Fedorovich: Andrey Georgiyevich, let us all the 
same return to science and to what is now happening in it. We 
received, honestly speaking, a difficult legacy. It turned out 
historically that industry, which in our country had always 
nudged science, had been militarized. The scientific traditions 
in our country are a very graphic illustration of this. We have, 
perhaps, so few scientists who are Nobel Prize winners because 
our science was basically a ``closed theme.'' How are you trying 
to change this? 
  Fonotov: No sphere on this level can be changed 
individually. Science is a part of the overall cultural system 
of society, if you take our Soviet culture, it was completely 
deficient. And this appears first of all in the quality of 
scientific personnel. 
  Fedorovich: But were there outstanding scientists 
in the USSR? 
  Fonotov: As is known, the blossoming of Russian 
science of the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 
20th century was accompanied by the overall cultural blossoming 
of Russia of that time. And this confirms my ideas that Soviet 
science was in some sense the illegitimate child of Russian 
science. Because many domestic scientific schools and prominent 
scientists were educated in tsarist Russia--take Zhukovskiy, 
Sikorskiy, Zvorykin, Ipatyev.... And the next generation still 
stayed at the level which Vernadskiy, Pavlov, and Florenskiy 
predetermined. But then that was all, it was a waste. You get 
Chernobyl, you get accidents on gas pipelines, capsizing ships, 
falling planes. In our country all values, which determine the 
ethos of the scientific community, were turned upside down, the 
result is that the ethos began in the final analysis simply to 
be destroyed. Only people like L.V. Kantorovich, who lived 
outside this community and was an unworldly man, were able to 
survive. Such people were able to aspire to Nobel Prizes. 
Science has its own laws of development, and it is impossible to 
judge it in terms of benefit or harm. This is a very intricate 
institution, which the most complex and most subtle combination 
of conditions of origination precedes. We today, unfortunately, 
do not have an environment, in which science could have a 
full-fledged existence. For long years the state decided what it 
was necessary to do, in what directions, what directions were 
beneficial and what ones were harmful. We shut down cybernetics 
and genetics and launched scientific communism. Scientists were 
employees. The priorities of science were distorted: First of 
all they directed attention to technical disciplines connected 
with the production of weapons. For example, the theory of 
Pavlov was cultivated because it made it possible to influence 
the state of the mind and social psychology. Our not so stupid 
disciples of Stalinist, communist, and similar propaganda used 
splendidly the theory of conditioned reflexes. If about 10 years 
ago you were to say to a person the word imperialism, he would 
issue the corresponding discordant epithets. Things, which did 
not particularly interest the state, were neglected. Modern 
directions of knowledge and research could not actually and 
intrinsically ripen on Russian soil, by imitating we were all 
the time in the position of chasers. Our present situation first 
of all is dictated, unfortunately, by the loss of the internal 
mechanism of the self-development of the scientific community. 
Of course, in all countries of the world science is to some 
extent both a maidservant and a kept woman of the state. But all 
the same there are limits, beyond which the actions of the state 
begin to affect science destructively. 
  Fedorovich: In the West, as is known, the state 
plus some companies or others sustain academic and university 
science. Mainly firms support sectorial science. In our country 
they are tearing the state to pieces: Money is needed here, 
money is needed there, but there is no money, so will we imitate 
the western system or will we invent our own wheel? 
  Fonotov: You and I talked about Soviet science. 
However things were there, this science functioned and achieved 
some goals, otherwise they simply would not have supported it. 
But the point is that when certain social institutions fade away 
and recede gradually into the past, science, which was formed as 
an integral part of this society, of course, also cannot be 
preserved in the form in which it existed. However, a question 
arises: What kind of science can form in our country, if we do 
not know toward what kind of society we are heading? The very 
general parameters, which are formed in programs of the state 
and in other public documents, thus far are incapable of tracing 
this society clearly. One thing is clear: This should be science 
that is based on the free search for the truth. Of course, it is 
possible to reply: How can a scientist be free, when they do not 
give him money? I understand, for today's people of science this 
is a drama, but they are now if only not forcing them to report 
back at the meeting of the party committee on the work that has 
been done. And they are not making them go during working time 
to ideological seminars. Nevertheless we have been forced to 
find answers to many questions: After the structure of the 
government of the country was changed, many scientific research 
organizations found themselves thrown to the mercy of fate. And 
thereby the stream of assets, which came to them through certain 
channels, dried up. What was it necessary to do immediately 
under these conditions? The idea of federal science centers 
arose. Of course, for the present it is rough, moreover, thus 
far they have been creating obstacles for us, and we simply 
cannot get our legislative acts through the staff of the 
government and through the numerous reconciling instances. For 
example, they say to us: "Why does the science center contain 
several legal persons? Let them unite into one." But would you 
try to make such institutes as the Central Aerohydrodynamics 
Institute, the Scientific Research Institute of Aviation 
Technology, and the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of 
Aviation Materials one legal person? Each one has its own very 
well-known trademark. We argue, ask advice, and seek allies. 
Meanwhile, you know, in the year and a half that I have been in 
this chair, the nature of the interrelations in the scientific 
community has changed appreciably: Earlier people came to us, 
figuratively speaking, on half-bent legs, but now they drop in 
like they would at a scientific seminar. We and they talk, 
argue, and swear at one another. Of course, the Ministry of 
Finance ruined us soundly, when it ceased to pay us money in 
May, and we, for example, during the third quarter received only 
13 percent of the amount of planned assets. One has to extricate 
oneself by means of reserves, owing to the fact that 
organizations are getting credits, thereby running into big 
debts. Some of them will probably not endure such a thing. But 
nevertheless I am observing a completely different nature of 
interrelations--not supplication, but partnership. 
  Fedorovich: But scientists are continuing to 
leave. What is your attitude toward those who are leaving Russia? 
  Fonotov: A combined attitude. In any society there 
can be a situation, when people simply have not been able to 
adapt to the existing circumstances in the collectives in which 
they work. There are no complaints here. A person did not find 
himself here, perhaps, he will find himself there. It is no 
secret that today we are also continuing to finance not 
scientists and not scientific schools, but abstract 
``collectives.'' In our country the addressness is for the 
present still weak, that is, the elite, the people who are most 
talented, thus far can directly receive money in our country 
with great difficulty. Nevertheless many people are leaving not 
because abroad it is possible to eat and dress well and educate 
children, but because here they have no opportunity to work. And 
nevertheless, no matter what difficult times there are today, I 
want to say that there is the concept of a common cause and 
one's native country, which today is having a hard time and 
which it is necessary to help. Although Guy de Maupassant called 
patriotism the egg that war laid.... I believe that in bad times 
it is necessary to assume the general burden of problems, while 
it is necessary to leave in good times, but this, unfortunately, 
is in theory. 
  Fedorovich: And how many scientists have we lost 
today? 
  Fonotov: Now about 90,000 are leaving annually. 
Incidentally, this figure comes to only a fourth of the quantity 
of so-called permanent emigration from the USSR. In practice of 
these 90,000 only 2 percent fall to the category of scientific 
workers. True, one should specify: This figure is from the 
department of visas, the OVIR. But there are, after all, also 
those people who, while leaving for a temporary job, remain 
abroad forever. The statistics are silent with respect to them. 
The scale of this process is rather large. At the Academy of 
Sciences there are already now institutes, at which half of the 
lead associates are on missions abroad. 
  Fedorovich: If we have begun to talk about the 
Academy of Sciences.... What do you think of the latest edicts 
that give the highest echelon of science, that is, academicians, 
all sorts of benefits? 
  Fonotov: All edicts are not alike. And, of course, 
any edict, which is aimed at supporting science, the scientific 
community, and the scientific and technical potential, should be 
regarded as positive. But I am categorically opposed to it when 
one of the units of the scientific community at the expense of 
others carves out certain benefits for itself. In our country 
many people believe that the academy is all Russian science, 
although the academy is only 8 percent of the people and 12 
percent of the scientific potential. In our country basic 
research to a significant extent is conducted outside the 
academy. For example, high energy physics, chemistry, and 
economics. The academy is very respected and prestigeous, but 
nevertheless one of the institutions of the scientific 
community. Therefore, when the president signs an edict, which 
for some reason is entitled ``On the Material Support of Russian 
Scientists,'' and puts all these assets into the hands of the 
Academy of Sciences, the entire scientific community is 
bewildered. I do not believe that one must not give anything to 
the academy, but it is necessary to give something to the 
Ministry of Science and Technical Policy, because we formally 
represent the entire scientific community. In reality we 
represent for the scientific community the state and for the 
state, the scientific community. So that an independent 
committee, of which it would not be a sin to invite foreign 
scientists to be members, should probably be established for 
such actions. A comprehensive approach to the very functioning 
of science and a unified position of the scientific community 
are necessary, otherwise many good initiatives will be doomed to 
failure. For example, all our attempts last year to get through 
the Supreme Soviet a draft law concerning the fact that grants 
would be exempt from any tax assessment, were torpedoed. They 
said to us: If foreign charitable foundations give such aid, we 
will not tax it, but if a university--this is as is not a 
charitable organization--gives it, please, we will take it 
without fail. Today we are thereby consciously cutting off the 
narrow stream of money, which Russian science is capable of 
receiving from abroad. If the actions of the scientific 
community in such cases were coordinated, the results would be 
more significant. And some parts of the scientific community 
must not try to gain some advantages at the expense of the 
others. 
  Fedorovich: What do you think of the fact that 
several scientists have begun to open their own firms? Fedorov 
is a hackneyed example, but there are also others.... 
  Fonotov: There is nothing bad in this. 
Incidentally, many of these firms in one way or another are 
financed by the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. We 
financed Fedorov, for example, very solidly, considering the 
social value of what he does. The state under Ryzhkov gave him 
about 300 million rubles. At that time this was an enormous 
amount of money. And today it is a considerable amount: 
somewhere around 300 billion rubles. We hope that many of our 
scientific production associations, which have a good research 
potential, for example, the State Optics Institute imeni Vavilov 
and the State Institute of Applied Chemistry in St. Petersburg, 
in a few years with better, normal guardianship of the state, 
and first of all the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy, 
will become Russian du Ponts and Fords. The State Institute of 
Applied Chemistry, in particular, has a unique technology of 
ozone-safe coolants. Both the Koreans and du Pont have already 
offered to buy them from us. In pharmacology there are quite 
amazing developments. In practically all spheres we have 
world-class developments, and we should learn to commercialize 
them. 
  Fedorovich: And what is happening now with the 
scientific and technical centers that we built abroad? 
  Fonotov: Do you have in mind distant foreign 
countries or neighboring ones? In the former USSR many research 
facilities remain, including in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and 
Ukraine. We also did much building in developing countries, 
incidentally, we also have something in developed countries. 
Inasmuch as during the construction they used our standards and 
our technologies, they were thereby bound to our markets. And 
we, of course, should make every effort so that Russian 
metallurgists, not specialists from the FRG or Japan, would 
carry out the reconstruction of Bhilai. We have all the 
resources for this. It is necessary to agree to the elimination 
of any political problems that arise, for the best policy is a 
good economy. Of course, because of security considerations it 
is impossible to release some technologies from control, selling 
them thoughtlessly to third countries. Here together with 
interested departments we are trying to establish some barriers. 
As to neighboring foreign countries, the trends of cooperation 
in the CIS are intensifying, a commission, which, it is true, 
for the present is poorly picking up speed--the interstate 
scientific and technical council--has been established; there 
are agreements that regulate the use of joint facilities, for 
example, in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan is next in line, and, I 
think, we will come to an agreement with Ukraine. Honestly 
speaking, without our former republics, particularly Belarus and 
Ukraine, it will be very hard for us to live: We will have to 
create everything from scratch. I am not talking at all about 
space research. In order to build a new Baykonur, we need to put 
the entire country on a starvation diet.... 
  Fedorovich: Are there weaknesses in your activity 
as deputy minister? Do you sympathize, perhaps, with some 
specific area of science? 
  Fonotov: I have a weakness for talented people. 
Inasmuch as the scientific elite of the country passes through 
this office, it is necessary to work with it, it is necessary to 
help them, it is necessary to lead them to the machinery of 
government and to admission to other ministries. As a whole 
first of all the problem of scientific and technical policy, for 
the formulation of which I am responsible in the ministry: How, 
what, by what forces and in what time we will do all this, is 
important for me. 
  Fedorovich: So how much time, in your opinion, 
will we need in order to restore the scientific potential and 
not to end up in the category of third-rate countries? 
  Fonotov: There is an optimistic forecast and a 
pessimistic forecast. The pessimistic forecast is 30 years. 
While the optimistic forecast depends on a large number of 
subjective factors. If the president had been able to reach an 
agreement with parliament in December of last year, we would be 
today much farther along the path of reforms and would have 
already now some results. And there would be no talk about the 
fact that atomic reactors are standing unattended somewhere in 
Dmitrovgrad or in Obninsk and soon there will be no one at all 
to work at them, because there is nothing with which to pay 
wages. Poorly financed science, as we understand, increases 
significantly the risk of a catastrophe. True, the fact that 
people are continuing to work even under these very difficult 
conditions, is consoling. And therefore I am not losing hope: 
Given favorable circumstances in about 10 years we will all the 
same have overcome what we dread most.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Demchenko, IZVESTIYA correspondent: </F>
``Banks Do Not Want to Finance `Pure' Science''; the first 
paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] An attempt to analyze what sums are being invested 
in the development of science and development and introduction 
of new equipment and technologies has been undertaken by the 
Market Conditions Center of the Russian government. A total of 
1,500 directors of enterprises with different forms of 
ownership, representing 11 industrial branches, answered 
questionnaire items related to innovation activity (work 
director--Georgiy Ostapkovich). 
  The inquiry indicated that so-called branch science, the 
scientific research institutes and design bureaus specializing 
in the filling of orders of enterprises in definite industrial 
branches, has almost completely lost orders directly from 
enterprises and exists only under conditions of a constant 
shrinking of budgeted financing. Virtually all the work on 
improvement in the technology of production and the quality of 
products has been shifted directly to the enterprises and less 
than half the queried enterprises are at all concerned with this. 
  The principal direction in innovative activity at 
enterprises 
is the introduction of new types of production (about half the 
queried directors). Work on the automation of production, the 
introduction of new technologies and forms of organization of 
activity were mentioned by three or four times fewer directors. 
In the administrative sphere renovation most often involves 
computerization (39%). 
  In the future a quarter of the queried directors intend to 
invest sums on innovations. Joint stock companies are exhibiting 
great activity in this field and the least activity is being 
displayed by leasing enterprises, partnerships with limited 
responsibility and production cooperatives. As the principal 
sources of financing the directors mention their own resources, 
as well as short- and long-term loans. 
  The directors of 173 commercial banks also participated in 
the inquiry. More than half of them declared that they make no 
loans at all for innovation projects, despite the fact that the 
income received by the banks as a result of such loans is free 
of taxation; 48% of the queried banks grant loans for 
innovative projects directly to industrial enterprises and the 
more actively the greater the statutory reserves of the bank. 
  The bankers, in answering the questions on the 
questionnaire, 
declared bluntly that financing for the renovation of production 
facilities and production will be made available only after a 
system for state insuring of credits for innovations has been 
established and a clearly defined mechanism for the application 
of a secure loan law has been introduced. 
  In commenting on the situation in this field, Garegin 
Tosunyan, president of the Moscow Bank for the Development of 
Science and Technologies (Tekhnobank), stated that hopes for the 
financing of science in the absence of patent and juridical 
protection of the results of individual work, as well as 
management servicing scientific circles, is an illusion from 
which it is necessary to escape as soon as possible. In his 
words, specialists developing innovations most frequently turn 
to the bank themselves asking for sums either for a particular 
project or on a handshake: we will buy something, sell it, repay 
the loan, and pay ourselves from the profit. Virtually not once, 
said the banker, have we dealt with an engineer, scientist or 
designer who was capable of looking at the extension of credit 
problem from our point of view: how great are the chances that 
the sums handed out by the bank today will be returned tomorrow 
with a profit compensating for all the losses, including 
inflation? To the question of specialists of the Tekhnobank 
credit section from whence the various kinds of equipment 
necessary for the new production would come, the most common 
answer is: ``They promise they will supply us with it.'' 
  It is interesting that there is at least one sphere of 
production in which the banks themselves have recently begun to 
exhibit innovative activity: the production of pharmaceuticals. 
This market at present to a considerable degree is not filled 
and the demand is very high and elastic: there are medicines for 
which people are ready to give their last ruble. In addition 
there are idle plants at which it is possible to master the 
production of new drugs and an alternative marketing network. In 
this field itself a management system is now being formed 
serving the interests of developers and bankers and a system for 
search for new drugs for the purpose of financing their 
production. 
  With respect to the remaining branches, according to data 
from the Market Conditions Center, the greatest innovative 
activity is observed in ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy. The 
situation with innovations in the light, food and printing 
industries is the very poorest.

``The Present Generation of Russian Scientists Will Live Under 
Communism. At Least 700 People Are Already Living Under It''] 
  [Text] Last Monday more than 700 associates of the Joint 
Institute of Earth Physics (OIFZ) of the RAS [Russian Academy of 
Sciences] voluntarily (!) took two-week leaves without the 
retention of pay. 
  ``The most skilled personnel: deputy directors, heads of 
laboratories, lead scientific associates, heads of economic 
subdivisions--in all 81 people--voluntarily refused to receive 
wages,'' relates Academician Vladimir Strakhov, director of the 
OIFZ. ``In their statements they wrote as follows: I wish the 
days to be considered workdays, but wages not to be credited.'' 
  Another 684 associates of the OIFZ--again voluntarily--took 
leaves without pay proper. But of them very many are continuing 
to come to the institute and to perform their official duties. 
  ``The sense of responsibility of the scientist proved to be 
higher than considerations of an accounting nature. And I am 
very grateful to them for this,'' Vladimir Strakhov emphasized. 
``This action is enabling us to release 40 percent of the 
month's wage fund, that is, 23 million rubles [R].'' In all at 
the institute it had been planned to spend a little more than 
R80 million on the September wages. R62 million were allocated 
from the state budget. But this money so far has also not come 
to the accounts of the OIFZ. 
  What the Bolsheviks talked about for so long--``we will 
arrive at the victory of communist labor''--has come to pass: 
About 70 percent of the associates of the academic institute 
have already arrived at this ideal. And voluntarily besides. 
  Incidentally, this occurred on the eve of another 
significant 
and long-awaited date for Russian science. ``For the purposes of 
the preservation of the intellectual potential of the Russian 
Federation, the further development of basic and applied 
research, and the increase of state support of the workers of 
budget-carried organizations of science and higher educational 
institutions of Russia I decree....'' I have quoted the preamble 
of Edict No. 1372 of the president of the Russian Federation of 
16 September 1993, ``On Measures on the Material Support of 
Scientists of Russia.'' Several points of this edict should take 
effect on 1 November of this year. (The salaries for the 
academic title of academician of the RAS are R150,000 and for a 
corresponding member, R75,000; for scientists of budget-carried 
organizations and workers of higher educational institutions the 
monthly supplementary payments for academic degrees are 50 
percent of their official salaries.) 
  According to the information at the disposal of NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA, neither in the planning and finance administration of 
the RAS nor in the departments of the RAS does anyone know 
precisely the technology of implementing this point. Although 
``instructions'' have arrived at several scientific 
organizations: If the financial situation permits, you are 
allowed to fulfill this edict. 
  The road to hell, as is known, is paved with good 
intentions. 
And this hell has quite real, specific financial parameters. As 
a whole for the section ``Science'' for nine months of 1993 
financing was opened in the amount of R500,380,049,100. What is 
this? This is 49.3 percent of the annual plan and 75.7 percent 
of the plan of nine months. The total arrears of the budget to 
science are R160,672,337,900. The institutions of the RAS and 
its regional departments have been financed at the level of 
86-100 percent. The financing of priority directions of science 
and technology is 70.6 percent of the plan of nine months and 
46.5 percent of the annual plan. 
  The financing is broken down by specific directions in the 
following manner. Programs of operations of state science 
centers--82.6 percent of the plan of nine months; state 
scientific and technical programs--60.6 percent; the most 
important national economic programs and projects--62.8 percent; 
international programs and projects--40.8 percent; regional 
centers and programs--24.5 percent; programs of the development 
of the innovation infrastructure of science--7.5 percent; 
financing of the Basic Research Fund--58.6 percent. 
  There is another detail. According to the testimony of a 
high-ranking administrative worker of the RAS, in recent times 
talk, the goal of which is to prepare the ground, and at the 
same time the Russian Academy of Sciences itself for the 
decrease of its budget next year, has been circulating in the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Finance.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Pokrovskiy, under the rubric </F>
``Science'': ``Expertise Becomes Independent''; first paragraph 
is DELOVOY MIR introduction] 
  [Text] The council of the Russian Basic Research Fund 
[RFFI] has approved several documents that regulate virtually 
all actions of its staff and experts, which will make it 
possible to settle any conflict situations and, as a result, to 
enhance the effectiveness of RFFI. 
  In essence, the regulatory documents amount primarily to 
clear-cut delegation of functions and authority of fund 
agencies: fund council, expert councils, executive committee, 
body of experts, and fund management. At present, the procedure 
of providing expert opinions is as follows. Applications for 
funding come to the expert council and two experts (let us 
recall that in the 1993 competition, because of the shortage of 
personnel we had to limit ourselves to one expert per 
application), whose names are kept secret. Each expert qualifies 
a project on the basis of several aspects and gives it an 
overall rating, using a three-point scale: ``definitely 
supported'' (1), ``can be supported'' (0), and ``rejected'' 
(-1). If all three ratings are positive, the project 
automatically receives support. 
  Each scientific direction (according to the quota approved 
by 
the fund council) has the right to a specific share of the RFFI 
budget. If, after supporting definitely approved projects, it is 
not exhausted, projects with one zero and two one's come next, 
and so on in descending order. If there are insufficient funds 
to support the next batch of applications, they are submitted 
for consideration by the expert council. Within the quota 
limits, approval of applications is purely automatic. 
  There has also been a change in structure of the RFFI: there 
is approval of the composition of the executive committee, which 
assumes some of the duties of the fund council during the period 
between its meetings. There has also been approval of expert 
councils and composition of the body of experts. Experts are 
allowed to submit applications for grants to the RFFI on a 
general basis. In the opinion of fund staff, the rules that have 
just been adopted are theoretically quite capable of resolving 
any conflicts that may arise. 
  The slogan proposed by its new chairman, Academician 
Vladimir 
Fortov, is ``Independent expertise with high intellectual 
potential.'' 
  In our opinion, everything will depend on how well the new 
rules we have described will work. And we are assured that they 
must work well because activities of the fund will be automatic, 
instead of being subject to influence peddling or the will of 
superiors. It seems that the fund's affairs are on the rise. 
Incidentally, it receives funds directly from the Ministry of 
Finance, rather than through the Ministry of Science, as before. 
With today's shortage of money in Russia, the fund receives 
almost everything it is supposed to (as does all of science, 
about 80 percent): this year, the fund expects to get 24 out of 
the 30 billion rubles requested (it has already received 13.5 
billion), and it will use these funds to complete the bulk of 
its 1993 programs, and first of all the program for individual 
and group grants. 
  At the present time, work is in progress on the concept of 
augmenting the sum in the RFFI account by making expert 
evaluations of projects having no direct bearing on basic 
science. Specialists from institutes of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, institutions of higher learning and industrial 
laboratories have been included among the RFFI experts. True, 
the fund is not being inundated with orders, although it is 
already obvious that very large entities require such a service, 
for example, the VPK [military industrial complex]. Negotiations 
with customs officials have begun concerning expert evaluation 
of materials transported across the frontier. On this score, 
Vladimir Fortov stated: ``There is not a single organization in 
the country today that could compete with us in intellectual 
potential and our independence of other agencies.'' 
  Being a nonprofit organization, the RFFI can receive money 
only from the State budget or in the form of voluntary 
contributions. I hope that Russian entrepreneurs will hear the 
latter, and will realize that science is the highest and main 
potential for the future rebirth of Russia. It is time, finally 
time to learn that ``gray gold'' is much more precious than 
``black gold.''

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Fonotov, doctor of economic sciences, </F>
Russian Federation first deputy minister of science and 
technological policy on ``The `Three Whales' of Technological 
Progress'' by Yevgeniy Temchin; first paragraph is ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI introduction] 
  [Text] Andrey FONOTOV, RF first deputy minister of science 
and technological policy ponders on problems of funding basic 
and applied sciences. 
  Question: Andrey Georgiyevich, the situation in 
Russian science is common knowledge; Russia has already lost 
many great minds, and there will be more losses. Does the 
ministry have any plan or idea to save at least what is left? 
  Answer: There is an idea and we are trying to 
implement it as much as possible. While funding of research was 
virtually unselective under the former socialist State, at 
present we are striving to adopt expressly this attitude, which 
is foreign to our science. 
  The market has shown how much people are worth. Those who 
were failures before do not shine now either. Whereas active, 
talented scientists are not needy today. They have the 
opportunity to earn well, serve as consultants for projects and 
programs, providing their exert opinions. 
  The State is unable to support economically all scientific 
groups. Not a single state, even the richest one, can afford 
such luxury. A strictly selective approach is used in the United 
States, Germany, Japan and other countries. The State funds one 
project and freezes another, since it believes that there are 
more pressing problems at a given time. It is expressly this 
direction that our ministry is trying to follow. 
  In short, there are three directions in our idea. The first 
is to give economic assistance to implement major pioneering 
projects and research programs that could raise our science to 
the worldwide level. The second is to support selectively the 
strongest and most promising research organizations. The third 
is to provide financial assistance to outstanding scientists 
deserving of worldwide recognition, as well as to the most 
gifted representatives of the young generation. The RAN [Russian 
Academy of Sciences] has already won a decision, according to 
which the State pays high-class scientists something like an 
increased grant. Of course, the money is not commensurate with 
the research results, but still it is rather substantial 
assistance. 
  Question: But this applies to basic science, what 
is to be done about applied science? 
  Answer: Applied science should be funded on the 
basis of return. If the project is promising, the State must 
fund it, but not as was done before. 
  Question: Please explain. 
  Answer: In giving funds to support some laboratory 
or some institute, the State is giving, so to speak, an advance. 
When a buyer pays for a completed project, a specific part of 
the proceeds, let us say thirty percent, must be returned to the 
State. 
  Question: Is this something like a bank credit? 
  Answer: Yes, but on preferential terms, without 
payment of high interest. At the present time, our ministry is 
trying to involve commercial banks in this matter. In simple 
form, the idea consists of the following: A commercial bank 
investing in the support of innovative projects offers 
considerable preferential terms to creditors and, in turn, 
enjoys certain benefits from the State. It should gain from 
supporting innovative work. 
  Question: In Russia, State research centers (GNT) 
are formed at the initiative of the ministry. As a rule, these 
are known research institutes that enjoy worldwide recognition. 
However, some specialized research institutes involved in 
applied science are also included. And this is wise: industry 
cannot live without applied science. How many GNT are there in 
Russia? 
  Answer: At present there are thirty-six. 
  Question: But there are hundreds of specialized 
research institutes. It appears that most of them are either 
doomed to fail or compelled to look for work on the side, rather 
than in their own field. Plants do not have resources at the 
present time for high-grade technologies and related research. I 
think this is a very dangerous situation for industry. 
  Answer: Of course, we are striving to support 
specialized science, which is carrying out highly effective and 
promising work. But first the authors of such work must submit 
to us technical and economic validation, results of marketing 
studies and a business plan. Then this work is submitted to 
expert evaluation and, if it has merit, it receives budgeted 
funding. But this applies to pioneer projects that hold great 
promise. And if a new processor is developed, it is a strictly 
commercial development and its authors should look for buyers 
themselves. 
  Question: Who evaluates the technical and 
scientific level of a new development? 
  Answer: There is the Russian Institute of 
Scientific Expertise. It has a data bank with information about 
outstanding scientists, and they are called upon to do this 
work. The names of the scientists are kept secret, even we do 
not know them. The opinion of experts about a specific project 
is given in the form of a recommendation. The final decision is 
made by the ministry. Then, if the project is approved, we turn 
to the Government, prove its timeliness and obtain funding. 
Under present conditions of the Treasury, this is not a simple 
matter. 
  As for GNT, and the list will grow, we believe that they 
should enjoy not only preferential credit, but also preferential 
rates for fuel and electricity. I wish to stress that the GNTs 
status is not given permanently, but for only three years. If 
the project does not yield the promised effect in this time, the 
State stops funding it. 
  Question: Do the experts have some responsibility 
for the results of their work? 
  Answer: Yes, unquestionably. This is stipulated in 
pertinent documents. But I wish to make a comment. Let us assume 
that our developers created an excellent computer and the 
experts noted its high qualities. But who is going to buy it 
when the Japanese sell the same one for one-third of our price? 
Or, for example, the problem with sugar. People come to us and 
offer a new technology for producing sugar from starch, and this 
would solve the shortage problem. But, how much will the end 
product cost? We find out that it is much cheaper to purchase 
sugar abroad than to use this technology to produce it. What 
sense is there in funding such a project? 
  Today there is no problem with the technical execution of 
some specific task. There is another problem, that of its cost. 
Is it economically expedient? Scientific technological progress 
occurs at the intersection of technology and economics. The 
ministry is approaching problems of funding science from 
expressly these positions.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Morgenshtern: ``All This Brain Drain. </F>
The West Can Find Jobs for 200,000 Russian Scientists. If Russia 
Cannot Do It''] 
  [Text] The general mood in many Russian research institutes 
can probably be characterized as a state of quiet panic. 
Salaries are held back for months, and the rate is close to the 
``zero variant''; the arrival of scientific literature has 
virtually stopped, there may also be no light or telephone. 
Every time there is news about the departure of a colleague to 
work abroad on ``outrageous'' terms, according to our and the 
Brazilian concept, those left behind fall into even deeper 
despondency. 
  What is really happening? A recently published study, 
"Emigration of Scientists From Russia: Today and Tomorrow," by 
O. A. Ikonnikov (Moscow, 1993, 123 pages, illustrated) strives 
to answer this question. The study was carried out by order of 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Science and contains abundant 
analytical and statistical data on the brain drain problem, and 
its impact on the Russian scientific potential. 
  We learn that the level of emigration from Russia is not 
high 
as yet, even by West European standards. The main form of brain 
drain is religious-ethnic migration (Germans to Germany, Jews to 
Israel); nor have so many left for contractual work or to study, 
according to the fragmentary official data. Thus far, 8.1 
percent of all individuals who go to Israel (6.0 percent to the 
United States, 8.3 to Germany) are scientists and public 
educators. 
  Perhaps there is nothing to worry about? Nevertheless, there 
are obvious grounds to take emergency steps on the highest 
level. What is frightening in today's brain drain from Russia is 
that it is occurring against a background of mass change from 
research activities to entrepreneurial, managerial, political 
activities, loss of job or qualifications. The process will 
inevitably progress with reduction of State funding of science 
and obvious difficulties in balancing goals and funds in 
scientific policy, from the standpoint of priorities. Thus, in 
1991, 522,000 people left the field of science and scientific 
services. But departure abroad of citizens working in this field 
did not exceed 5,300 people.

  The hypermobility criterion proposed by the same author (see 
O. A. Ikonnikov, ``Hypermobility of Scientific Personnel: 
Problems of Forecasting,'' 1993, No 3, pp 96-107), i.e., 
excessive movement of scientific personnel when the 
scientific-technical potential is devastated, confirms the alarm 
of our scientists and engineers. Is there a chance that 
decisions adequate to the acuteness of the situation will be 
made? Alas, only time will tell.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidates of Economic Sciences Olga Savelyeva </F>
and Irina Pomortseva, the ISTINA Center of Informatization, 
Social and Technological Research, and Philosophy of Science 
Analysis: ``Where Is the Youth of Science Going?''--first 
paragraph is POISK introduction] 
  [Text] We offer to the attention of the readers the next 
report prepared by the Istina Center, with which we are working 
in regular contact. Using these and other results of joint work, 
we intend in the immediate future to broaden the themes and to 
increase the effectiveness of the installments of ``Our 
Exchange.'' 
  In recent years the steady tendency for associates to leave 
scientific research organizations (NTOs) has emerged. Young 
people, maintenance personnel, scientific workers of high 
skills, and middle-level specialists are leaving. Official 
statistics do not make it possible to establish promptly the 
scale, directions, and structure of this phenomenon. The work 
performed by the Istina Center to the order of the department of 
social problems of science of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Science and Technical Policy will make it possible to clarify 
the situation. During it 42 scientific and technical 
organizations of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Moscow Oblast with 
a total of about 16,000 workers were examined. Academic, 
sectorial, and plant science, which both is and is not (four 
organizations) state property, is represented at them. The 
number of personnel at the NTO ranged from 60 to 3,600. 
  The survey was conducted in two stages. At the first stage 
the overall change of the number of personnel during January-May 
1993, the sex, age, position, and skills of the scientists and 
specialists, who quit during this period, were determined 
through the personnel departments of the NTOs. At the second 
stage of the survey in a telephone survey of these workers the 
directions of the departure of personnel from science 
(emigration, a change of the type of activity, transfer to the 
private sector of the economy, and so forth) were ascertained. 
The data of this survey, which were obtained from more than 400 
people, made it possible to gain original statistical material 
that is making it possible to analyze thoroughly the problem of 
the migration of scientific personnel on the basis of real 
factual data, and not various kinds of hypotheses. 
  It turned out that during the first five months of this year 
the number of personnel at the surveyed NTOs decreased by 7.2 
percent. What does this mean? According to the data of the 
Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics, the annual 
decrease of the number of employees at NTOs came in 1990 to 12 
percent and in 1991 to 16 percent. So far there are no official 
data for 1992, but the forecasting figure was specified at the 
level of 20-30 percent. Our survey confirmed the fact that the 
trend toward the decrease of the number of employees in science 
also remains during the current year, 1993, although its pace 
has become somewhat less. 
  The results of the analysis of the reasons, for which 
associates quit NTOs, are interesting. Of those surveyed 86 
percent did this at their own request or in connection with 
being transferred to another job (that is, again at their own 
request). For Moscow this indicator came to nearly 91 percent. 
Thus, the departure of personnel from NTOs for the present is 
not connected with organized reductions. Incidentally, last 
year, in 1992, when at Russian scientific research institutes 
and design bureaus two or three reductions of personnel were 
carried out, they were responsible for only 25 percent of the 
departure of personnel from science. 
  The analysis of the problem of who is leaving NTOs provides 
even more food for thought. For this purpose the personal data 
of 675 scientists and specialists who had quit were studied. The 
results were somewhat unexpected. Approximately an identical 
number of men and women quit. However, if you consider that the 
share of women in science comes to more than 55 percent, it is 
possible to conclude that men "are being flushed" from NTOs more 
intensively. Nearly half of those who quit held earlier the 
positions of engineers, designers, and so forth, about 30 
percent held junior scientific positions from trainee to 
scientific associate. The number of people who quit after the 
age of 40 exceeds slightly the number of people who quit not 
having reached this age. Here, however, it is necessary to take 
into account that the share of the younger age groups at NTOs at 
present is small, therefore, a high intensity of the "flushing" 
of young people from science still lies behind the smaller 
absolute figure. 
  Of the 675 people who quit during the first five months of 
this year 18 went abroad (to live or to work under contract for 
a period of more than one year). All of them are workers of 
well-known academic scientific research institutes. Thus, not 
external, but internal migration, that is, the transfer of 
scientists to other sectors and spheres of the national economy, 
is playing a far greater role in the dynamics of scientific 
personnel. 
  From the telephone survey of those who had quit it became 
clear that 85-90 percent of them already had an understanding on 
a new job. In those cases, when a person left "for nowhere," it 
was quite difficult for him to find a job (the chance of getting 
a job came to one in five). Only 40 percent of the respondents 
again went to work in state structures, 52 percent left for 
private organizations, cooperatives, and joint-stock companies, 
6 percent left for joint ventures, about 0.5 percent left for 
foreign firms, and a little more than 1 percent engaged in 
individual labor activity. Among the people who left for state 
enterprises the share of women, people 40 to 60 years old, and 
those people, who earlier held the positions of senior 
scientific associates and higher, is large. Primarily men, 
people up to the age of 40, as well as people who held junior 
scientific positions and positions of specialists, are getting 
jobs at organizations of the alternative sector of the economy. 
Seventy five percent of the doctors of sciences and 56 percent 
of the candidates of sciences, who quit scientific research 
institutes, also transferred to a job at nonstate organizations. 
Representatives of the physical mathematical and technical 
sciences, as well as the people, who engaged earlier in 
scientific and technical development and services and in 
introduction, prefer them. 
  Responding to the question of the type of basic activity of 
the organization, to which they transferred, 23 percent of the 
telephone respondents named research and development, 22 percent 
named scientific and technical services and introduction, 25 
percent named the making of a product, 19 percent named 
intermediary activity, 8 percent named commercial and purchasing 
activity, and 15 percent named services and consulting. The 
total of the above-cited percentages does not equal 100, 
inasmuch as the same respondent could indicate several 
directions of activity of the organization. 
  The survey also showed that for the most part women and 
people over the age of 40 are remaining in science or ``near 
it.'' Young people up to the age of 30 are leaving mainly for 
the sphere of intermediary activity. Comparatively many 
candidates and doctors of sciences, as well as people, who held 
earlier scientific positions from senior scientific associate 
and higher, are transferring to organizations of the scientific 
and technical type. 
  In order to supplement and at the same time to verify the 
responses to the preceding question, the respondents were asked 
to assign their new place of work to one of the sectors of the 
national economy. Twenty six percent of the respondents named 
the sector ``Science and Scientific Service,'' 30 percent named 
``Industry,'' 18 percent named ``Trade, Public Dining, 
Procurement, and Marketing,'' 6 percent named ``Finance, Credit, 
and Insurance,'' and 0.6 percent named ``Education.''Among young 
people 19 percent went to work again at NTOs, 21 percent left 
for industry, 28 percent left for trade, and 9 percent left for 
the sphere of finance. Among those who had quit 37 percent of 
the candidates and doctors of sciences, 33 percent of those 
people who had held scientific positions, and only 11 percent of 
the engineers, economists, and other representatives of 
nonscientific specialties, who worked at NTOs, remained in 
science. 
  For physicists and mathematicians science, education, and 
finance proved to be most appealing. Representatives of the 
technical sciences and chemists transferred mainly to industry. 
About 25 percent of the economics scholars remained in science, 
22 percent of the latter left for trade and 19 percent left for 
financial organizations. Of the surveyed representatives of the 
humanities 41 percent began to work again at NTOs, 18 percent 
left for a teaching job, and 18 percent left for administrative 
bodies. As a whole the obtained data testified that 55 percent 
of those who left NTOs had changed drastically the sphere of 
their activity. This is especially typical of young people. 
  In what did those who quit NTOs engage at their new place of 
work? Twenty six percent of the respondents replied that they 
engaged in research and development, 28 percent--in scientific 
research services and introduction, 18 percent--in 
entrepreneurial activity, 22 percent--in administration, and 11 
percent--in physical labor. It would be interesting to learn 
precisely who of the former workers of science began to engage 
in enterprise? For the most part these are men (there are 
threefold more of them than women), people up to the age of 30 
(33 percent) and from 30 to 40 years old (29 percent). In this 
group there are practically no scientists and specialists over 
the age of 40. It also turned out that among the new 
entrepreneurs there are many people, who had held at NTOs 
positions that were not connected with research activity, and, 
however strange this is, scientists who had worked on basic 
problems. And another somewhat paradoxical result that was 
obtained during our survey is that mainly those people who are 
over 50 had begun to engage in physical labor. 
  It is no secret that one of the basic reasons for the 
departure of personnel from science is the low level of the 
remuneration of labor in this sector. About 92 percent of the 
scientific workers and specialists of NTOs consider their income 
at their main place of work to be lower than average. At the new 
place they, it seems, are finding what they sought. Nearly 33 
percent of the associates, who left NTOs this year, are 
satisfied with the present remuneration, 34 percent--``more yes 
than no,'' 18 percent--``more no than yes,'' 8 percent are not 
satisfied, and 7 percent found it hard to answer this question. 
Thus, 67 percent of the respondents rated favorably their new 
wage. 
  The degree of satisfaction with the content of the new job 
is 
also high--for nearly 71 percent of the respondents. The highest 
level of dissatisfaction is observed among the people who 
engaged earlier in basic research. 
  And, finally, the last question that was addressed to the 
respondents during our survey: ``To what degree is your new job 
connected with the previous one?'' The responses are broken down 
as follows. Ten percent of the respondents replied "It is a 
direct continuation," 28 percent believe ``It is connected,'' 
for the remaining 62 percent of the scientists and specialists 
the previous and present jobs are not connected in any way. 
Among young people this indicator is even higher--nearly 74 
percent. Those people, who engaged earlier in basic research and 
the humanities, proved to be most devoted to their old jobs. 
  What tentative conclusions is it possible to draw from the 
results of the conducted survey? First, the tendency for the 
number of employees in science to decrease remains. Second, the 
overwhelming majority of associates of NTOs are quitting because 
they are finding a more appealing (based mainly on material 
criteria) place of work, and not due to reductions of personnel, 
which have been organized ``from above.'' 
  Another important conclusion is that only 40 percent of the 
scientists and specialists of NTOs, who quit, go to work at 
state structures. About 45 percent of the respondents are now 
working again at NTOs or at organizations that are connected 
with science and technology. It is very important that the 
satisfaction with the wage and the nature of the work at the new 
place is nearly ninefold higher than on the average among 
workers of the sector ``Science and Scientific Service.'' 
  Scientists and specialists up to the age of 40, that is, the 
most promising and able-bodied group, are transferring most 
actively to other sectors of the national economy and are 
beginning to engage in new types of labor activity. And this 
latter fact is, perhaps, the most unpleasant and alarming 
conclusion among those that were obtained during the conducted 
survey.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Gurvich; under the title RA Global </F>
Information System Is Not a Utopia: Its Design Has Been 
Developed by International Scientists, under the rubric 
Perspective] 
  [Text] The International Academy of 
Information-Disseminating Technology [MAI] was established in 
1991. At the present time it has 80 regional divisions in 
Russia, the countries of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent 
States], Europe and America, where its 1,200 members and 
corresponding members work. The Academy has set as its principal 
aim the objective of promoting in every way possible the 
construction of a society in which each individual may freely 
use the information resources accumulated by mankind. Right now 
the International Academy of Information-Disseminating 
Technology is actively preparing to hold an International Forum 
on Information-Disseminating Technology. It will take place in 
the Hall of Columns of the House of Unions from 23 through 26 
November. 
  I was talking to the First Vice-President of the 
International Academy of Information-Disseminating Technology, a 
leading scientist in the field of computer technology, Eduard 
Evreinov. As far back as the 1950's he proposed principles for 
increasing the output of computer processes that have been 
widely recognized throughout the world. 
  The line I am working along is the construction of a system 
of high-output facilities which use the model of the collective. 
Its essence resides in the fact that the calculations are not 
done by one person, but by several. The summation of common 
efforts increase the power of the operations being performed 
many fold. The President of our Academy, Ivan Yuzvishin, has 
advanced the following theory on the basis of these principles: 
let us build a society consisting of small cells, for example, 
microregions, and let them interact with one another, and agree 
on their relationships with one another. That is, the entire 
society will acquire the structure of a honeycomb. What I am 
saying can be illustrated by the situation which has developed 
between Russia and Tatarstan, in which just such an interaction 
model has been used. When I told the President of Tatarstan, 
Shaymiyev, that he was acting in the vein of YuzvishinUs model, 
he had not known this, but he was pleased that the correctness 
of his policy has been confirmed by science. In this case the 
issue is not self-isolation, but the fact that each country or 
sovereign republic itself determines the internal regulations of 
its life. When, on the other hand, the issue relates to problems 
whose solution exceeds the capacities of the republic, it 
delegates a portion of its plenary powers to whomever it wishes. 
  You are in favor of the creation of a unified global 
information space. So, your activity should be of the same 
world-wide character. 
  The International Academy of Information-Disseminating 
Technology is now on the threshold of joining UNESCO; the 
question of our recognition as an independent organization is 
being considered by the UN. Our centers, in addition to Moscow, 
are located in Washington, Riga, and Kazan. I think, as far as 
Washington and Riga go, this is more or less understandable. But 
why Kazan? We want to use this region as an example, to create a 
model of an information community, all the more so since, as I 
have already said, President Shaymiyev is using its principles 
in his activities. He has been granted, in this connection, an 
honorary diploma of our Academy. 
  All that's fine, but I would like to know what the Academy 
is 
engaged in specifically, since it has taken on itself such a 
serious mission. 
  First we need to talk about our means of existence, since 
everyone knows how science is financed here. We have taken 
earning our own money as our principle. In practical terms we 
have the possibility of developing all kinds of projects, since 
we bring together scientists and practitioners working along the 
most diverse lines. Let me cite an example. A scientist who has 
six discoveries to his credit is a member of the International 
Academy of Information-Disseminating Technology. There are no 
other scientists of this level in the world. He invented a 
system which makes it possible to measure the flow rate of a 
liquid with a precision exceeding the contemporary level by two 
orders of magnitude. This permits achieving a substantial 
reduction in the consumption of energy resources. 
  We are attracting member organizations to this work. The 
chairman of a cooperative came to us one day and said: I want to 
work with you, using the AcademyUs resources, and to return the 
profits towards its development. 
  If we accept an organization or group of scientists into the 
International Academy of Information-Disseminating Technology, 
and they don't have the resources to do the work, the Academy 
offers them credit. 
  Eduard Vladimirovich, the situation relating to information 
science in the USSR, and now in Russia, has always been 
complicated; in this field we have seriously lagged behind the 
advanced countries. What can the Academy do to change the 
situation? 
  I must say that the information science situation in Russia 
can't be looked at apart from the rest of the world. Information 
has become the main product of society. And it is everywhere; to 
use it effectively we need unified means of transmitting it. The 
International Academy of Information-Disseminating Technology 
has worked out a design for a global computer system. A model 
that brings together individual users and consumers of 
information into a single common system lies at its base. I have 
called it provisionally an information enterprise. But 
information is a product which does not require people to be 
near one another while they are using it. That is, this 
information-distributing enterprise should function both in a 
single-user mode, and when the need arises, as an 
all-encompassing global structure. It should encompass the 
entire world. Of course, such a system cannot be made 
immediately on a world-wide scale; one can start with fairly 
small units, such as a single city. However, so far there are 
not enough resources either in Russia or even in the West to 
bring all this about. 
  So that's the system. But, domestic computer technology is 
also not at an advanced level. 
  As far as theoretical developments go, there we are not 
behind. Transputers have been produced in England since the 
beginning of 1980's. They work on principles that I proposed in 
the 1960's. Now the capacity of transputers has reached 100 
billion operations per second. People are working on transputers 
here as well, and more improved models are being developed than 
are produced in the West. We are behind in technology; we don't 
have plants which are capable of producing the equipment. But we 
cannot fail to get our manufacturing in order, because a country 
like Russia cannot get by only with imported machines. And the 
Academy is ready to provide assistance in the resolution of this 
problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Frolov; ``Crisis in Patenting Activity </F>
at Hand; But It Seems That There is a Solution''] 
  [Text] It was never easy going for inventors in the first 
country of victorious socialism. Already in the years of the 
developing New Economic Plan the rights to their inventions were 
actually taken away, patents being replaced by Author's 
Certificates, which to a full measure only the state could use 
at its pleasure. 
  However, the collapse of socialism, marked by the breakup of 
the union, only increased their concerns. The new patent 
legislation adopted at that time was inefficacious, and 
beginning on 1 December 1991 Gospatent SSSR ceased to exist. 
  The unified patent space was destroyed and the vacuum 
created 
in the system for the protection of industrial property, it goes 
without saying, could not go on for long. It then seemed most 
logical to establish national patent offices in the forming 
independent states. However, this logic was dictated primarily 
by considerations of a political nature. It was clear from the 
very beginning to the professionals working in the field of 
patent expertise, however, that neither they nor inventors would 
come out well with such a shape of things. First of all, what 
naturally happened was that all the specialists and patent 
archives were concentrated in Moscow. In the overwhelming 
majority of the new states there was no one to establish their 
own patent offices and it was known that the protection 
documents issued by them could make no pretense at authority. 
  Second, the disintegration of patenting activity put before 
inventors a task that was not easy solved: in each former 
republic of the union the application had to be submitted in the 
national language and the same applied to correspondence with 
the expert. It is easy to imagine that all this entails 
considerable costs, to which corresponding fees also must be 
added. 
  Third, foreign applicants found themselves in a completely 
improbable situation: for protection of their rights over 1/6 
the surface of the planet, instead of one patent, they had to 
finalize 15, as already mentioned, not characterized by a solid 
reputation. 
  In this very uncomfortable situation it was Rospatent, 
perhaps, which felt itself on the surest ground. It was the 
successor of the corresponding union structure, also inheriting 
from it both the personnel and archives. This circumstance, as 
well as the fact that most of the inventive potential is 
concentrated precisely in Russia, enabled the directors of this 
office to nourish hopes that it would be able to survive the 
crisis with minimum losses. In fact everything proved to be 
considerably worse. Whereas earlier the All-Union Institute of 
State Patent Expertise had annually received up to 200 thousand 
applications for inventions alone and among these more than 
65% 
were those of Russian inventors, now the number of applications 
has fallen to 50 thousand. In Russia patenting activity is now 
experiencing an unprecedented decline, specialists and experts 
are threatened with cutbacks and unemployment, and all this is 
occurring at a time when patent legislation in the country for 
the first time has possibly approached the level of the best 
world models. 
  It cannot be said that the organizers of the patent service 
have not attempted to get around the stumbling blocks and 
restore a unified patent space. Already on 27 December 1991 
representatives of Armenia, Belorussia, Moldavia, Russia, 
Tajikistan and the Ukraine signed in Minsk an interim agreement 
on the protection of industrial property. This act was then 
regarded as a step toward the adoption of an Intergovernmental 
Patent Convention. In order for it to enter into force it was 
necessary that three of the states signing it meet three 
conditions: recognize validity in its territory of the 
norm-setting basis of the agreement, recognize the validity of 
the earlier issued protective documents of the USSR and send a 
representative and his deputy to an administrative council. The 
only state conforming to all this was the Ukraine. However, 
separatist strivings then seemed more attractive to the others, 
including Russia. 
  Fortunately, the idea of intergovernmental cooperation for 
the protection of industrial property, whose viability has been 
beautifully demonstrated by the European Patent Office, was not 
buried even in the territory of the former USSR. In March 1993 
in Moscow there was a conference of CIS heads of state at which 
an agreement was signed on measures for protecting industrial 
property and the organization of an intergovernmental council. 
Its first session was held in May and in September the draft of 
a patent convention was prepared which was called the Eurasian 
Patent Convention. This document was given high marks by the 
World Organization of Intellectual Property and it is expected 
that in late December-early January its finalized variant will 
be presented for signature by the heads of state. In the opinion 
of Viktor Blinnikov, chairman of the International Bureau for 
the Protection of Industrial Property, there are already real 
chances for restoring a unified patent space within a year. The 
Eurasian Patent Office will become the second major regional 
association and already on the eve of its birth it is attracting 
the interest not only of the former members of the union, but 
also neighbors, members of the former Council for Mutual 
Economic Assistance. The interest of China, where, in contrast 
to Russia, there has been no dropoff of inventive activity, also 
is of special importance. 
  In principle any interested country can become a member of 
this pool and no membership dues are required from it, but the 
activity of the Eurasian Patent Office will be on a 
pay-for-itself basis. Although the new structure will become an 
exclusively international organization--the specialists will 
even have diplomatic status--its organization will bring more 
than a little moral and material profit to Russia. The 
headquarters will be in Moscow, all documentation will be in the 
Russian language, but for conducting a patent search the 
services of Rospatent specialists will be drawn upon and its 
archives will be used. According to Viktor Blinnikov, all these 
services will be suitably paid for, which possibly will assist 
Russian patent specialists to survive difficult times, and the 
appearance of a universal patent will stimulate both national 
and foreign inventors. It goes without saying, if both of these 
groups hold out another year and the project is successfully 
implemented.

<F P=106> [Article by President of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova </F>
Academician Andrey Mikhaylovich Andriyesh: "How Science Is 
Living"--first two paragraphs are NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Tomorrow Andrey Mikhaylovich Andriyesh, a physics 
scholar, president of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova, an 
academician, an Honorary Member of the Academy of Sciences of 
Romania and the Academy of Engineering Sciences of the Russian 
Federation, and an Honorary Academician of the Academy of 
Cosmonautics imeni K.E. Tsiolkovskiy, turns 60 years old. 
  The editorial board of NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA joins in the 
numerous congratulations that are being addressed to the 
celebrator. 
  At present Moldova, like all the former Soviet republics, as 
well as the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, is going 
through the difficult, excruciating period of the transition 
from one socioeconomic state to another, from a totalitarian 
regime and a centralized economy to a democratic society and a 
market economy. This period has proved to be very complicated, 
with a large number of most urgent problems of the most diverse 
nature, with a sharp production slump and crises not only in the 
economy, but also in all other spheres of social life. 
  Now a task of vital importance is to find means of getting 
out of the present situation, the task of establishing a 
rule-of-law state with a normally operating economy. All 
structures of society, including, of course, science, are 
interested and should take part in its accomplishment. 
  In the modern dynamic world further progress is altogether 
inconceivable without science. It should provide answers to all 
urgent problems and, what is more, should foresee and predict 
the emergence of new problems and the means of their optimal 
solution. Our scientists are working in such vitally important 
areas as economics, ecology, interethnic relations, the 
restoration of the historical truth of our past, the observance 
of the principles of social justice, and the raising of the 
prestige of human values. The same, at any rate no less, 
attention is also being devoted to other directions of academic 
science. We see in precisely this the role of scientists of the 
republic at the present stage of its historical development. 
  The Academy of Sciences of Moldova at present is the leading 
scientific center of the republic. About 1,300 associates, 
including 140 doctors of sciences and 770 candidates of 
sciences, are now working in its 25 subdivisions. 
  At the scientific institutions of the Academy research is 
being conducted on urgent problems of physics and mathematics, 
engineering, geology and seismology, chemistry, biology, 
agriculture, geography, medicine, economics, history, language, 
literature, ethnography, the culture of Moldova, and so on. Our 
applied research and development are aimed at the solution of 
the most urgent problems in the area of ecology, agriculture, 
and power engineering and at the development of new materials 
and technologies. 
  Of the most important developments in recent years, which 
are 
of directly practical importance, it is possible to name an 
advanced technology of the cultivation of alfalfa, flow charts 
of the obtaining of two or three crops a year from the same 
area, technologies of the production of various biological 
preparations for the protection of plants, a whole-milk 
substitute for the feeding of calves, a technology and equipment 
for the electrospark machining of metals, a set of equipment for 
the electric refining of vegetable oils, Plazmoliz equipment and 
technology, a technology of the production of aromatizers from 
the waste products of the essential oil industry, multicomponent 
materials for optoelectronics and microelectronics, a technology 
of the production of synthetic wollastonite, various 
preparations for medicine, and much more. 
  In recent years at the Academy of Sciences of Moldova 
important steps have been taken to bring science in line with 
the new tasks facing the republic. A new concept of the 
development of science was adopted. A detailed analysis of the 
basic directions of research was made. The organizational 
structure of the Academy was improved. The Government of the 
republic approved its new charter. The international ties of the 
Academy of Sciences of Moldova were expanded substantially. 
  I want to direct attention to one (among many others) 
important change in the structure of the activity of the 
Academy, which, we hope, in the future will have a substantial 
influence on the functioning of all science of the republic. At 
the end of last year and the beginning of this year three new 
departments of sciences--the agrarian, technical, and medical 
departments--were established at the Academy. They are called 
upon to fill the gaps, which existed until now, in the degree of 
coverage by the Academy of those fields of knowledge, which 
until now had practically no ties with it. As a result the 
research, which was being conducted at sectorial institutes and 
higher educational institutions, was not coordinated at the 
proper level on the scale of the republic, which decreased the 
significance of the contribution being made by science to the 
national economy of the republic. 
  At present the coordination of the directions and themes of 
science in the republic is one of the main tasks of our science. 
A few years ago such coordination existed, although it was 
carried out mainly from the union center and to a significant 
extent was formal. After the collapse of the Soviet Union this 
coordination also disappeared, although its need in principle is 
obvious. Precisely for these reasons we believe that the 
building up of the Academy with the three indicated departments 
of sciences is called upon first of all to change the state of 
affairs in this area and to promote the orientation of our 
entire scientific potential toward the comprehensive and 
coordinated solution of the most urgent problems of the republic. 
  At the present stage of civilization science, as an explorer 
and builder of the future and as an extremely integrated result 
of creative activity, cannot develop in isolation. It has become 
an area of joint activity with common results for all mankind. 
In other words, science is profoundly international and can 
develop only in case of constant contacts among the scientists 
of different countries and only through the constant sharing of 
ideas, opinions, results, and experience. 
  Our Academy of Sciences already has considerable experience 
in international ties. However, until the proclamation of the 
independence of the republic the ties were confined for the most 
part just to the former union republics and were in many 
respects of an episodic nature, with the exception, perhaps, of 
Ukraine and Belarus, with whose scientists we cooperated more 
intensively, and this cooperation is continuing. In practice we 
did not have direct ties not just with capitalist countries, but 
even with the countries of the former Soviet bloc. While the few 
ones that were maintained were carried out only with the 
permission of the All-Union Academy or with its aid. 
  The situation changed after 1990, when the real opportunity 
appeared to establish direct scientific ties with any countries 
of the world, including in the form of contracts and agreements, 
including the elaboration of joint themes, the establishment of 
international laboratories, and so on. In 1992 alone we 
concluded a new agreement with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences 
and Athens National Polytechnical University and agreed on joint 
scientific research with scientists of Poland. Steps were taken 
toward cooperation with scientific centers of Italy, Sweden, 
Great Britain, France, Germany, China, India, and Turkey. Our 
traditional ties with the former Soviet republics are also not 
being severed. 
  In the same 1992 our Academy of Sciences participated in an 
international meeting of academies of Great Europe in Stockholm, 
at which there was an interested discussion on the means of 
developing cooperation, on the exchange of information and 
specialists, and on the participation of the academies in the 
joint elaboration of global problems in such areas as ecology, 
airspace, and health care. I want to note that at the academies 
of the countries of Western Europe they are greatly alarmed by 
the formed situation in science and, in particular, in academic 
science in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In 
connection with this the conference participants came forth with 
an appeal to governments and international organizations to 
support science in every way in the countries of the former 
Soviet bloc. 
  This year our Academy has already taken part in the 
international conference "Scientific Policy in the Service of 
Great Europe," which was held in Germany. Here the Academy of 
Sciences of Moldova was recommended for membership in the 
Association of the European Community for the Support of Science 
in Eastern Europe. Last September we became cofounders of the 
International Association of Academies of Sciences--a 
nongovernmental self-administered organization that was 
established for the combining of the efforts of scientists of 
the sovereign states, which have been newly established on the 
basis of the former republics of the USSR, and other countries 
in the solution of the most general scientific problems, for the 
coordination of scientific strategy, for the support of the most 
promising research, and for the joint use of unique and 
expensive equipment. The holding in July of this year in 
Chisinau of the 18th Congress of the American-Romanian Academy, 
in the organization of which we took a direct part, is evidence 
of the increased international authority of the Academy of 
Sciences of Moldova. 
  In recent years our ties with scientists of neighboring 
Romania have been developing particularly fruitfully. At present 
all the institutes of our Academy are cooperating with Romanian 
scientific centers, research is being conducted on more than 60 
themes. 
  Thus, at the Academy of Sciences of Moldova the same 
reorganizational processes are taking place as throughout the 
republic. We have already achieved much, but much still has to 
be done so that science would become a more significant support 
in the accomplishment of the tasks facing the country. 
  At the same time I cannot but direct attention to the 
difficult conditions, under which we have to work, and to the 
problems with which we are faced. First of all I want to 
indicate the continuing lack of receptivity of the national 
economy to the achievements of science--an unheard of phenomenon 
in developed countries. Here the orders of the national economy 
for scientific research and development have decreased sharply. 
Whereas in 1985 the amounts paid to our account from the 
fulfillment of economic contracts came to about a third of the 
entire amount of financing of the Academy, in 1992 they came to 
only 7 percent and are continuing to decrease. Today we can 
offer for introduction more than 60 scientific developments. 
However, in spite of all our efforts, they are not being taken. 
The lack of interest in the results of the activity of 
scientists and, consequently, the decrease of economic contracts 
are sharply aggravating the financial support of science, which 
today is based in practice only on budget financing. 
  We know the difficult financial situation of the republic 
and 
understand that Parliament and the Government can allocate for 
us only very modest funds. Moreover, they are unstable, their 
real significance is steadily decreasing. The budget allocations 
for science in our republic in their real significance decreased 
from 37.6 million rubles in 1990 to 15.6 million rubles in 1992, 
that is, to less than half, although in nominal terms they 
increased substantially. For comparison let us note: Last year 
the allocations for science in Moldova came to only 0.45 percent 
of the national income of the republic, while, for example, in 
Germany back in 1989 such allocations came to 2.8 percent of the 
national income. 
  Due to financial difficulties first of all the research 
process is suffering, inasmuch as we cannot acquire the 
necessary hardware, equipment, chemicals, and other materials. 
  Due to the lack of assets, especially currency, it is 
becoming more and more difficult to support international 
scientific ties, especially trips of our scientists abroad. And 
I cannot but agree with the president of the Academy of Sciences 
of Ukraine, who stated that at present a real economic "iron 
curtain" has arisen before scientists of the former union 
republics. 
  Inadequate financing, the lack of housing, the general 
uncertainty as to the future of science, and, in connection with 
this, the decline of the prestige of science as a sphere of 
activity, particularly for talented young people, have given 
rise in recent years to another problem--the problem of 
personnel. Scientists are abandoning science, are leaving for 
other spheres of activity, and are going to other countries. 
Last year 80 associates from the Academy of Sciences alone left 
the republic, of them two were corresponding members of the 
Academy, six were doctors of sciences, and 31 were candidates of 
sciences. This year only 72 people, who wish to devote 
themselves to science, were admitted to graduate studies of the 
Academy. 
  It is possible to continue the list of today's problems of 
science, including academic science. However, scientists fully 
realize that their very own efforts are required for the return 
to science of its role as the motive force of progress. Today 
the basic task of academic science is to correctly direct its 
attention to the solution of the most urgent problems facing the 
republic, to the strengthening of the ties with sectorial and 
VUZ science, and to the expansion of international cooperation. 
The main thing is not to lose the achieved potential and 
scientific personnel.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Illarionov, Novosibirsk: ``The </F>
Peace-Loving Face of NATO in Akademgorodok. Comments on the 
Search for New Mechanisms of Scientific Collaboration Between 
the East and the West''] 
  [Text] It is difficult to impress Akademgorodok in 
Novosibirsk. At the height of the``cold war'' it received de 
Gaulle and Nixon, and in the spy craze era, Gersh Budker, who 
was at that time director of the top-secret Institute of Nuclear 
Physics, liked to invite probable James Bonds to eat Siberian 
pelmeni [similar to ravioli]. 
  Still, the workshop (for the sake of simplicity let us call 
it a seminar) attended in late November by the Siberian 
Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and NATO's 
research program department prompted unconcealed interest there. 
Suggestions on possible points of agreement were somewhat 
defined when Alain Joubert, director of NATO's program for 
international scientific exchange handed out to the seminar 
participants a list of 60 international conferences and seminars 
within the framework of the 1994 NATO program on ``Science to 
serve society.'' 
  These meetings will deal with such priority interests of 
mankind as the new generation of immune stimulators, materials 
science for orthopedic implants, molecular aspects of 
carcinogenesis, climate sensitivity to radiation 
perturbations.... Technologies for disarmament, environmental 
protection, high-tech technologies for high-level investigation 
of human resources were mentioned as the priority areas of NATO 
research programs. 
  Do these remarkable, peaceful programs mean that NATO, the 
most powerful military group with its objectively inherent 
power-oriented attitudes, will miraculously change suddenly into 
some sort of international humanitarian organization? 
  The answer is easy. Even now, the North Atlantic bloc has 
something to protect and someone against whom to defend itself. 
And for a long time it will remain a military entity, and, God 
willing, let it be only defensive. But expressly this implies 
that friendly business relations will be established with it. 
  Of course it was difficult for Siberian scientists to behave 
as equal partners with representatives from the West at this 
meeting: the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences is in distress, as is all of Russian science. 
Scientists are engaged in a feverish search for funding. Yet the 
products of major research, as validly noted by Boris Saltykov, 
the Russian minister who spoke here, are sometimes sold abroad 
for outrageously low prices. 
  But if scientific developments become, at least in part, a 
commodity, the Siberians must be given their due: some solid 
results were submitted in the best way. It must be conceded that 
the Western emissaries arrived here quite well prepared. Upon 
meeting Professor Gerdt Maier, representative of the FRG 
aerospace research establishment, I was amazed at how well he 
was informed, not only about academic, but also industrial 
research of the Siberian scientists. What was particularly 
remarkable is that, while the official documents of the seminar 
listed the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and NATO research services as organizers, the circle of 
foreign participants at the meeting was much broader. Prominent 
figures attended: representatives of authoritative international 
organizations such as UNESCO and Pangis (pan-African working 
network of geological information systems), the international 
"Kazimir" project that deals with investigation of rift 
zones--faults in the earth's crust, the Association for 
Environmental Study in Rome, International Institute of Systems 
Analysis in Vienna, and International Institute of Forest 
Studies in Moscow, headed by Academician Aleksandr Isayev of 
Siberia. 
  But it is not at all a matter of listing well-known names 
and 
brilliant institutes: the logic of development of science leads 
increasingly to alliances of researchers from previously 
separated fields of knowledge and remote continents of our 
planet. 
  The study of forests has become in recent years a brilliant 
example of international and interdisciplinary collaboration. 
  Unfortunately, it is a common tendency to underestimate the 
danger that is developing before our eyes. Forest fires, for 
example, presently alarm mainly those whom they directly affect. 
Yet there are tens of thousands of forest fires per year on our 
planet, and the areas involved measure millions of hectares. 
  An objective scientific assessment is more alarming than the 
ordinary one. For example, Doctor Johann G. Goldammer from the 
Max Planck Institute (Freiburg, FRG) observed that the energy of 
an average forest fire is as great as the power of an atomic 
bomb. Furthermore, an enormous amount of carbon dioxide is 
released into the atmosphere, and this alone can cause global 
changes in the climate. And, according to estimates, within the 
next few decades it could lead to severe droughts over enormous 
territories, with all their tragic consequences. 
  The forest fires that have become more frequent in the 
United 
States and Canada, Spain, France and German, Italy, Austria and 
Switzerland, and, of course, in Siberia, have become serious 
grounds for scientists from these countries to join forces in 
order to solve this multifaceted problem. It was learned that 
such forest fires are caused, to a considerable extent, by man's 
cavalier intervention in the forest environment, depriving it of 
self-protection against fire. 
  Optimization of the condition of forest will require 
enormous 
expenditures and time far beyond the lifetime of a single 
generation of people. Today, however, the main thing is to learn 
to forecast a forest fire, detect it rapidly, assess it and nip 
it in the bud. 
  The unique experiment in Krasnoyarsk Kray last summer was 
concerned with solving these problems. For the first time 
anywhere in the world, it was possible to test the diverse 
knowledge gained in the last decades about forest fires, 
radiometric and other forecasting methods, assessment and 
tactics of extinguishing them. This was possible largely because 
the experiment, which involved a deliberately set forest fire 
covering a limited area, was carried out by the International 
Research Center of Boreal Forests in Krasnoyarsk. 
  One of the remarkable distinctions of development of major 
Siberian science in our difficult times consists of the fact 
that, perhaps, the most interesting results are achieved at 
international research centers, such as the one in Altay, 
Baykal, and the one dealing with solar and earth physics in East 
Siberia. There are 16 such centers today, and there will be more 
than 20 in the next few years. They use both the effect of 
integration of ideas and knowhow of the West and the East, and 
some financial aid from the West. Siberian science is an example 
of the experience and volume of collaboration with scientists 
from distant lands. Here, an increasing number of creative 
contacts are being established directly by research teams, in 
addition to officials. 
  As for collaboration with NATO, the main objective of the 
meeting in Akademgorodok was to develop programs for long-term 
scientific collaboration, rather than to receive immediately 
grants for participation in NATO conferences and seminars. 
  And a start has been made.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Stolypin, candidate for deputy to </F>
Gosduma, ``Bureaucrats Are Impeding Market Relations--Isotopes 
Could Be Painlessly Sold to the West.'' Conversion by Nikolay 
Ulyanov; first paragraph is NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA introduction] 
  [Text] Quite a lot has already been said and written about 
the problems of converting enterprises and institutes in the 
defense industries. Enterprises that produced tank engines are 
converting to production of metalware, aircraft parts 
manufacturers are setting up shops to produce synthetic socks. 
In general, some solution is being found in each specific case. 
But what is to be done about respecialization of associations in 
the atomic energy system, has any positive experience been 
gained in this field? This and other questions are answered by 
Vladimir Stolypin, recently chief of the laboratory for systems 
analysis in economics at the Institute of Atomic Energy imeni 
Kurchatov, and presently a candidate for deputy to the GOSDUMA. 
  Question: Do you think there is any possibility of 
switching high-tech industries that serviced our atomic science 
for decades to peacetime tracks? 
  Answer: Of course, there are possibilities. And 
they are revealed when one gains understanding of what is needed 
on the market so as to convert, relatively painlessly, but of 
course not without investment, many sectors and relevant 
industries and advance with our products to the international 
market. 
  Let me cite an example. We all know of the pioneering work 
carried out by Soviet nuclear physicists on isotopes separation. 
This is related to the fact that highly enriched uranium was 
needed, and technologies were developed within the limits of 
this project that are still in the fore of worldwide science. It 
would seem that, at least in part, these technologies could be 
used to obtain ultrapure stable isotopes that are in enormous 
demand on the world market. This is the simplest method of 
conversion, since production has already been set up; we only 
need to establish small marketing services to explore the demand 
market and offer this product. Stable isotopes are not products 
for wartime use, and they are used in the West chiefly for early 
detection of diseases. Most serious foreign clinics have 
instruments that operate on the basis of stable isotopes. 
Suddenly there is a paradox: export is banned. 
  Question: Why? 
  Answer: Bureaucrats believe that, since the 
Institute of Atomic energy was concerned with these matters, 
whatever it does is subject to additional permission through the 
pertinent agencies. 
  Question: To what agencies are you referring? 
  Answer:At first, to the Ministry of Atomic Energy, 
then government bureaucrats who previously worked in the 
Ministry of Industry. For example, Chernomyrdin has a deputy who 
endorses documents concerning atomic matters. And all 
bureaucrats will impede the sale of the products of conversion 
operations in order to retain for a longer time control of this 
direction of work. 
  Question: Aside from stable isotopes, what other 
developments of the Kurchatov Institute may be considered for 
export? 
  Answer: This is not an easy question, and it 
should become the subject of meticulous analysis. Obviously, 
there can be no question of exporting uranium, we have saturated 
the market with it to such an extent that the problem now is how 
to limit its sale, even for energy purposes. Even now, we can 
sell with great success the technologies for recovering 
ultrathin film, ultrapure filters, etc. We could also trade in 
products made of titanium and zirconium, for which there is a 
great demand on the world market. But with the disintegration of 
the Union, Russia was deprived of the possibility of mining for 
titanium and zirconium ore, which used to come from the Ukraine 
for the needs of Soviet industry. Enterprises dealing with 
processing these ores have actually shut down. The government 
should invest enough funds for speedy development of Russian 
titanium and zirconium deposits, and prevent the break of 
technological chains, thereby multiplying export capital! But 
the government has allocated barely enough to carry out 
scheduled geological exploration. 
  Question: Now a question that is not directly 
related to the topic of our conversation, but that has a bearing 
on conversion of the defense industry. It is probably not by 
chance that you have decided to run for office in the 
North-Western District of the capital, where the percentage of 
residents working in defense plans is considerably higher than 
in Moscow as a whole? 
  Answer: You are absolutely right. One could even 
arbitrarily divide the district's residents on the basis of 
their involvement in specific defense fields. Khoroshevskiy 
Rayon consists of research organizations related to the defense 
industry. Tushinskiy Rayon, to machine building organizations 
that service defense. I believe that my experience and knowledge 
in the field of conversion of high-tech industries are not 
unimportant to my supporters.

<F P=106> [Interview between Vladimir Gubarev and Vladimir Chernyshev, </F>
doctor of physical and mathematical sciences: ``This Explosion 
Is an Echo of the Future''; the first five paragraphs are an 
introduction] 
  [Text] Vladimir Chebyshev, doctor of physical and 
mathematical sciences, tells of the importance of the first 
Russian-American experiment carried out at the Russian Federal 
Nuclear Center. 
  ``In its importance that which occurred at work site No. 3 
at 
Arzamas-16 is comparable to the launch of the first artificial 
earth satellite,'' said the American professor Steven Younger, 
``and I do not exaggerate a whit because that work which we are 
engaged in is of enormous importance for the fate of 
civilization, it is no less inferior to space research, and 
therefore I have the right to make such a comparison with the 
launch of the satellite...'' 
  We will not dispute the American professor; he possibly 
exaggerates, but it is possible to understand him: for many 
months he ``fought'' the higher powers in the United States for 
the ``right'' to carry out joint work with the Russians (they 
have the same problems as we do!) and therefore the successful 
completion of the experiment so exhilarated Professor Younger. 
After all, this also justified the efforts made and what is most 
important, the doors were now flung wide open for future 
cooperation. 
  On our side the director was Professor Chernyshev. And what 
is there to hide; to a great extent due to Vladimir 
Konstantinovich everything went off brilliantly. After all, it 
was precisely he who was not only the ideological inspiration of 
the devised program, but also its organizer and executor. It was 
precisely the ``Chernyshev team,''riveted for many years on a 
single goal, which realized the ``launch of the first joint 
`thermonuclear satellite' in the history of the two 
countries--Russia and the United States.'' 
  Our conversation with the scientist began with the 
traditional question: 
  Gubarev: Who are you? 
  Chernyshev: Division head at the All-Union 
Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics, doctor of 
physical and mathematical sciences. I have been working here 
since 1950, since immediately after graduation from the Moscow 
Physical Engineering Institute... 
  Gubarev: And how did you chance to come here? 
  Chernyshev: I was chosen at the institute. 
Evidently someone took notice of me. I graduated from the 
institute with "flying colors." 
  Gubarev: Did you know where you were going? 
  Chernyshev: When I asked about this they told me 
that it was somewhere within the boundaries of Gorkiy Oblast. 
  Gubarev: What was your first impression? 
  Chernyshev: Very unusual... It was winter, 
January. There was a great deal of snow. The streets were very 
well plowed. Young soldiers in sheepskin coats maintained order. 
I felt concern about who lived here. And the living conditions 
were very comfortable for the young specialists who came here. 
Don't forget that 1950 had come and you can imagine what the 
situation was in the country... We were quartered in hotel No. 
2. Comfortable conditions, exactly the opposite from how we 
lived in Moscow! When we arrived in the dining hall we were 
surprised at the choice of dishes. And our first impression was 
that we had arrived in a ``corner of paradise.'' 
  Gubarev: And the next day? 
  Chernyshev: Work began. 
  Gubarev: Was it also like paradise? 
  Chernyshev: It was really work, very interesting, 
and I recall those years with satisfaction. The people paid no 
heed to time. It was commonplace to return from the work site 
sometime in the middle of the night and even toward dawn. 
Everyone worked with enthusiasm and each of understood that an 
extremely important task was being performed. None of us knew 
precisely what it was, but we guessed vaguely... 
  Gubarev: And when you learned for the first time 
that you were working on a weapon? 
  Chernyshev: The first year I vaguely guessed the 
nature of the work and a little later began to participate in 
discussions of the problems and naturally I understood that we 
were dealing with the manufacture of a nuclear weapon. I began 
to learn from Mikhail Yakovlevich Vasilyev. He was an 
exceptional lover of work, a fine experimenter, a very honest 
person... I always remember him with great warmth. He instilled 
in us a feeling of responsibility for the delegated task. He was 
our teacher. 
  A little later in the course of the work I had the 
opportunity to interact with Yuliy Borisovich Khariton. The 
meetings with him, I believe, left an indelible impression not 
only on me, but also on all the young specialists. 
  Gubarev: You are the experimenter. You did not 
know in detail about similar work which had been carried out in 
the United States. So how come you were at a very high level and 
were on a par with the Americans? 
  Chernyshev: Many specialists of our institute are 
very high-class specialists. And each in his own field can be 
proud of what he has done. Sooner or later each will be asked 
the question; ``And what did you do?'' And if you judge 
honestly, then the fingers on one hand will suffice to list the 
tasks done, but each of these tasks performed will bring you 
satisfaction because it was of a high class. And more than just 
one or two tens of specialists at our institute can be proud of 
such results. Now, looking backward and comparing the work of 
our specialists with those at other institutes, you are 
convinced time and again that a unique scientific center was 
established here with an enormous scientific-technical 
capability. 
  Gubarev: You constantly set off explosions. And 
were there many such experiments? 
  Chernyshev: Many thousands. Especially during the 
first years we worked day and night and therefore there were a 
great many explosions. 
  Gubarev: And just why did you set off the 
explosions? 
  Chernyshev: Even the most magnificent 
theoreticians cannot foresee everything. Usually there are close 
to the truth, but all the fascination is that you get a wet film 
and you see how the theoretical computations and the 
experimental results differ substantially because the phenomena 
with which you are dealing are nevertheless very complex. 
Mankind also has very little work experience in this field, 
after all, we are talking about high energy densities when a 
high concentration of energy, high temperatures and pressures 
are attained in short time intervals. The behavior of matter is 
very difficult to predict under these conditions. 
  Moreover, when you're talking about weapons, every step 
requires careful and thorough checking. If you look backward 
once again and attempt to determine how many useless and 
unnecessary experiments there were, their number is very small. 
But they also were necessary in order to understand how to move 
forward. 
  Gubarev: Probably it was pleasing for the 
experimenter to say: Dear Academicians Sakharov and Zeldovich, 
were you mistaken? 
  Chernyshev: This is a natural reaction... But it 
was far more pleasant when together with the theoreticians you 
make your way toward the truth. I had the satisfaction of 
working with both Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov and Igor 
Yevgenyevich Tamm. And I keep only bright impressions from these 
meetings. 
  Incidentally, when the first experiments with magnetic 
commulation were discussed with both Sakharov and Tamm they very 
naturally and simply sensed what was not understood. Andrey 
Dmitriyevich frequently repeated: ``Let's think together!'' He 
was a very magnetic personality, he understood us and discussed 
any problems as equals. And new ideas and new experiments took 
shape. Thus it was, for example, in the development of magnetic 
flux generators. 
  Gubarev: Was an idea of Sakharov the basis for the 
present-day experiment? 
  Chernyshev: Andrey Dmitriyevich proposed the idea 
of magnetic commulation in 1951. 
  Gubarev: Pardon me for interrupting, but in 
ordinary terms what is ``magnetic commulation''? 
  Chernyshev: This is the compression of a magnetic 
flux in a circuit by means of external forces. Some of the 
energy is transformed into magnetic field energy, and as a 
result of circuit compression the current sharply increases, 
which makes it possible to use such devices as generators of 
superpowerful magnetic fields. In this field great successes 
were attained by the now deceased Academician Aleksandr 
Ivanovich Pavlovskiy. In these same devices it is possible to 
obtain great supplies of energy and high flux densities during 
short time intervals. 
  In 1951 Sakharov stated that in principle it is possible to 
use magnetic commulation for producing a thermonuclear burst. To 
me this thought was very attractive. However, it was necessary 
to overcome enormous difficulties. Although during the first ten 
years some apparatus appeared, it already was clear that in 
order to produce a thermonuclear burst the power had to be 
increased a hundredfold. I had the idea of a disk explosively 
driven magnetic field generator and it began to take shape in 
1961. 
  Over the course of some time we were the only ones who had 
this technology. Our results were reported for the first time at 
an international conference in 1983. Unfortunately, attempts of 
American researchers to achieve the same results were not 
crowned with success. Naturally, in the report we did not give 
what is related to ``know-how.'' Thus, ten years have passed and 
now the Americans are undertaking energetic attempts to achieve 
that which we attained in 1983. 
  Gubarev: How do you explain their lag? 
  Chernyshev: Several factors. It seems to me that 
the Russian research was more innovative, because, however 
paradoxical it may seem, they worked under more difficult 
conditions. It is no secret that good outfitting with personal 
computers enables Americans to make many calculations and 
determinations, but at the same time ``slows down'' the 
development of thought. 
  Gubarev: It is clear what cooperation gives to the 
Americans. But what advantage is there to you? 
  Chernyshev: First of all, we understand the level 
at which they are. We are adopting a number of methods which we 
did not know of earlier and most importantly, are solving many 
thermonuclear synthesis problems. Indeed, even such a rich 
country as the United States by itself, without broad 
international cooperation, is not capable of solving this 
problem. 
  Gubarev: I propose such a project. We detonate a 
nuclear charge, transform the energy in your generator, direct 
it into a beaker filled with water, obtain a thermonuclear 
burst, and then direct this enormous energy to an electric power 
plant. The scheme seems so elementary, so what is fallacious 
about it? 
  Chernyshev: The fact that in the very first stage 
you use a fission reaction. Our task, however, is to obtain 
"clean energy." It is assumed that superpowerful magnetic 
generators will be used as the triggering device. In these 
generators it is the energy of an explosion, not the energy of 
fission, which is the operative agent; then a system is 
triggered in which there also is no fissionable materials and as 
a result of synthesis we obtain energy, some of which will be 
used for the next thermonuclear cycle and all the rest is 
directed for the needs of people. 
  Gubarev: Thus, the Americans nevertheless were 
doubtful in the first stage? 
  Chernyshev: This was related to the successes in 
developing explosively driven magnetic field generators. The 
history of their development dates way back. The first abstracts 
were submitted to an international conference as early as 1965. 
Andrey Dmitriyevich Sakharov even then insisted that Pavlovskiy 
and I without fail go to the conference and tell about our 
successes in this field. And here then began a game of ``leap 
frog'' with the trip, since after all we worked at a secret 
center. First they told us: ``Go!'', but after a month had 
passed it was ``No, don't go!'' 
  Finally, Aleksandr Ivanovich and I were called to Moscow for 
formalization of the passports and there again it was ``yes,'' 
then ``no.'' Finally Pavlovskiy and I became weary of all this, 
climbed into an aircraft and flew off to Arzamas-16. And our 
interests at the conference were represented at the conference 
by Sergey Petrovich Kapitsa. On his return he stated that our 
reports were very greatly anticipated there, interest was 
enormous and our results made a very strong impression on the 
Americans. 
  There was still another conference in Washington in 1979. We 
also presented a series of reports there. And again they did not 
allow us to go and therefore the Americans asked with interest: 
``If we come to Russia will we still not be able to meet up with 
the authors?'' Unfortunately, the answer of our specialists was 
evasive... And therefore the Americans concluded that 
``Pavlovskiy and Chernyshev'' did not exist and therefore when 
we appeared before them for the first time they were exceedingly 
surprised. Since 1983 we have already been regularly meeting 
with our American colleagues and such contacts are enabling us 
to learn better not only about one another, but also about the 
essence of that problem which we are solving together. 
  Gubarev: What were your impressions of Los Alamos? 
  Chernyshev: I was there twice. Both centers--Los 
Alamos and ours--somehow are very similar to one another. There 
is a special aura which prevails in both places. The strong 
sense of being cut off from the rest of the world. The very same 
system of passes and being photographed. And at the same time 
the creative atmosphere of scientific research. The Americans, 
the same as ourselves, are inspired in their work, are proud of 
it... We speak in different languages but our thoughts and 
actions are similar, very close. And therefore we so easily 
understand one another. 
  Gubarev: And you did not have the sensation that 
you were on the different side of a barricade? They made weapons 
in order to annihilate us and you made weapons to annihilate 
them? 
  Chernyshev: I think that you yourself can answer 
this question... It was a pleasure for us to confirm that the 
team of specialists gathered at Arzamas-16 in no way is inferior 
to that which worked beyond the ocean. And that we were capable 
of solving not only the same, but also even more complex 
problems. The sensation that you work in such a strong institute 
as ours was pleasant, I won't downplay that! I have been in many 
scientific institutes and at large scientific centers: in 
Moscow, at Leningrad, in the Urals and in Siberia, and I have 
always felt that our institute was for me. 
  Gubarev: I'd like to ask a more direct question: 
do you not regret that you have spent your entire life working 
on nuclear weapons? 
  Chernyshev: That was the duty of the times and I 
had to engage in it. 
  Gubarev: Do you feel that weapons work advanced 
different branches of physics and thereby facilitated the 
development of science in general? 
  Chernyshev: To be sure. Work on military projects 
always is carried out at the level of the latest advances. And 
without question there also is a payoff for all related fields. 
But at the same time each of us had the conviction that mankind 
would find sufficient common sense never to put nuclear weapons 
to use. 
  Gubarev: You were at the tests? What were your 
sensations? 
  Chernyshev: Mixed feelings. But one feeling 
nevertheless predominated. It was necessary that this weapon 
never be used. That was the principal conclusion. 
  Gubarev: What were your impressions from work with 
the Americans? 
  Chernyshev: It was important that such contacts be 
made strictly on an equal basis. If the arrangement is set up in 
that way everything is taken with understanding and respect. And 
honesty is necessary: this is possible and impossible. 
  Gubarev: The first experiment was behind you. What 
then? 
  Chernyshev: The Americans are proposing a program 
for the next two years. This is research on the physics of 
magnetized plasma. We are very interested in using American 
diagnostics, which in some respects is superior to ours. They 
have better computer resources and because of this--better 
processing of the results. 
  But at the same they have shortcomings. They, I repeat, are 
``loaded down'' with computers and therefore they don't want to 
think a little without having recourse to them. ``So there is no 
bad without good''; in this case some advantages appeared for 
us. The joint program on our theme is definite and clear for the 
coming years. 
  Gubarev: For example, the "thermonuclear 
satellite." And what place is occupied by "tokamaks"? 
  Chernyshev: I regularly visited the Atomic Energy 
Institute. Even at the time when the work was headed by Lev 
Andreyevich Artsimovich. And even then it seemed to me that this 
path not only was long, but also very expensive. Even if you 
bear in mind that our ``boublik'' would be five meters in 
diameter and with a cross section of about a meter, it can be 
counted on only as an approximation, an approach to ignition of 
the "thermonuclear satellite," and in order to obtain it the 
dimensions must be increased by an order of magnitude -- by a 
factor of ten! 
  A structure of cyclonic dimensions is obtained. It requires 
investments of more than one billion dollars. It is impossible 
for any individual country to realize such a project by itself 
and therefore different countries are cooperating. The entire 
approach is based on the prolonged containment of plasma. This 
is a very long-term and costly program. True, this is a 
stationary system in which the plasma will burn a long time. 
  To be sure, a great many problems appear which are related 
to 
the instabilities of plasma, its thrusting onto walls, cooling, 
etc. And therefore for those who in their spirit feel closer to 
pulsed systems an apparatus of such a type has no appeal. 
  Gubarev: What about lasers? 
  Chernyshev: These systems are as complex as the 
tokamak. There must be careful regulation of each beam. Should 
an earthquake occur anywhere an adjustment must be made and 
therefore there is a need for some kind of floating platform, 
etc. There also other kinds of apparatus which are equally 
complex and expensive. And each of them requires powerful energy 
sources and they exceed the power of all electric power plants 
on the planet by many times... 
  However, the systems which we proposed--I have in mind 
explosively driven magnetic field generators--make it possible 
to achieve ignition and even a demonstration experiment far more 
simply and less expensively. And indeed, before investing 
billions of dollars in a laser ``thermonuclear satellite,'' in 
an apparatus with ion beams, it must be understood: suddenly 
some restrictions show up which we do not suspect today! The 
results of experiments, as well as calculations, show that 
explosively driven magnetic field generators are the shortest 
path to obtaining ignition. 
  Fortunately, many American colleagues also share such a 
point 
of view... Once we told of our research, the course of our 
investigations, to Academicians Khariton, Velikhov and 
Aleksandrov. They insisted that we continue to work because if 
success comes it will be equal to the breakthrough into space. 
That's what they said... 
  They supported us very strongly, but now the events of 
recent 
years have exerted an influence on our work and has slowed it 
down. But a skeleton of specialists for the time being remains 
and this is very important--all are enthusiastic, they 
understand that a breakthrough into a fundamentally new field of 
science and technical progress is possible. This is a noble 
objective. I think that our mission will be accomplished if we 
come closer to the long-cherished dream that gives meaning to 
our life and work.

<F P=106> [Article by Vera Romanova: ``On the Eve of the Election the </F>
Presidium of the RAS Is Displaying Inertia. Only `Yabloko' Is 
Prepared To Think About Basic Science''] 
  [Text] Perhaps, the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) has 
become one of the few organizations that are not taking an 
active part in the election campaign. Of course, individual 
representatives of it are members of various parties and blocks. 
But here they are directing attention not at all to the 
interests of their colleagues. As for candidates directly from 
the RAS, it as a public organization does not have the right to 
nominate them. 
  In principle such a situation is very convenient for the 
leadership of the academy, which does not tire of repeating at 
every opportunity that the RAS is far from politics. 
Nevertheless the academy simply needs to have "its own" people 
in the new parliament. In its present financial situation and 
given the uncertainty of the future of many institutes and 
associates it is important as never before to have a lobby in 
the legislative body of power, and not simply good relations 
with its representatives. Therefore, the traditional 
conservatism of the RAS and the reluctance to take part in the 
political struggle in this case exceed a certain bound and can 
be interpreted as passivity, which subsequently can adversely 
affect its fate. 
  Of course, no one is making an appeal to break laws and to 
nominate candidates from the academy. However, the members of 
the Presidium, who are very tempted, cannot but know of other 
possibilities. An attempt was also made to use one of them. 
  At the meeting at the Institute of General and Inorganic 
Chemistry of the RAS Vice President Oleg Nefedov and Chief 
Scientific Secretary of the RAS Igor Makarov presented to the 
associates the candidate from the Universitetskiy District of 
the capital for the State Duma, Vice Premier of the Government 
of Moscow and Chairman of the Science Council of Moscow 
Aleksandr Braginskiy. The 45-year-old candidate (in recent times 
he has been known as a person, who was in the captivity of the 
supporters of Rutskoy and Khasbulatov during the events of 3-4 
October) has already done much for the RAS. In many respects the 
adoption of the program ``Science for Moscow,'' under which the 
city authorities are financing projects that are of interest for 
them, depended on him. This program has already been in effect 
for several months and has yielded a profit both for scientists 
and for the capital. Moreover, owing to the efforts of Aleksandr 
Braginskiy the rent for a number of scientific institutions was 
fixed at the level of the operating expenses, preferential terms 
for the payment for electric power were introduced, several 
scientists received apartments, and new health care institutions 
were put into operation. 
  The channeling of state budget assets not only into ``the 
reform of the judicial and law enforcement system and the army 
and the support of culture,'' but also into ``the strengthening 
of basic science and education'' is mentioned in Braginskiy's 
election program. Therefore, such a member of the State Duma is 
very important for the presidium of the RAS, although he will 
devote not all of his time to the defending of the interests of 
the academy. For the present it is not clear how in the future 
the RAS will support Aleksandr Braginskiy. 
  However, one member of parliament, of course, is not enough 
for the academy. Some more global actions are needed. And what 
is the most amazing thing, they have been carried out, true, not 
by the leadership of the RAS. 
  Candidate of Physical Mathematical Sciences Aleksey 
Zakharov, 
deputy chairman of the council of the trade union of workers of 
the academy, prepared proposals on the preservation of Russian 
basic science during the period of economic reforms, in which he 
evaluated the present situation and examined the problems of 
financing, property, legal space, and personnel. This document 
was sent by the author to all the election blocs. However, only 
the ``Yablinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin'' bloc agreed to use it. 
  There now appear in the draft of the election program of 
this 
bloc: ``the establishment of a fixed share of the revenues of 
the state budget as the lower limit of the financing of science, 
using the mechanism of the coordination of the interests of all 
budget-carried sectors; the use of the selective support of 
scientific collectives during the competitive selection of 
projects and their independent examination; the adoption of a 
special program of the privatization of state property in the 
sphere of science; the introduction of the preferential taxation 
of the assets, which are channeled into funds for the support of 
science and the higher school (including from abroad).'' 
  One question arises: Why is the chairman of the trade union, 
who, though he is defending the interests of scientists, does 
not supervise them, preparing his own proposals on how to 
preserve science? Why has the presidium, in whose hands are 
power and a large number of other opportunities, thus far not 
taken the same or a similar step? What is this--indifference, 
the loss of hope for the solution of problems at the 
parliamentary level or, through inertia, the desire as before to 
stew in one's own juice and in necessary instances to use 
personal contacts?

<F P=106> [Article by Eduard Filatyev under the rubric ``Scientific </F>
Surroundings'': ``Physicists Are No Longer Joking''--first 
paragraph is LITERATURNAYA GAZETA introduction] 
  [Text] Russia did not shudder, although this summer the 
Chernobyl disaster again began to be in the air. The 
inconceivable, exceptional event occurred casually, with the 
most sparse information. 
  The sensation of the year, if not of the decade, is like 
this: At two closed cities of Russian nuclear 
physicists--Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70--at meetings of many 
thousands a desperate word began to resound loudly: STRIKE. 
Warning notices were sent to the leadership of the country. 
  True, in the first official explanations of executives of 
the 
institutes it was specified: There is not a strike, but merely a 
prestrike situation. Is there a difference? Indeed, I do not 
know if a nuclear physicist comes near a ``piece of work,'' 
excuse me, not having eaten because of two- to three-month 
delays of pay. 
  Who does not remember the ``secret physicist'' Ilya Kulikov 
from Rommovskiy's ``Nine Days of One Year'' in the brilliant 
performance of I. Smoktunovskiy? An elegant, impressive, witty 
theoretical physicist "smelling like a barber," at whose service 
there was everything: from a seat on any scheduled airliner to 
enormous laboratories in secret underground bunkers. 
  Recently I had occasion to see him again. Of course, not 
Kulikov-Smoktunovskiy personally, but one of his prototypes. A 
man, who had become somewhat heavy, but as before was not losing 
heart, and was self-confident, left a single room of a hotel of 
the capital, which hardly anyone knows and is located in an old 
building on Maksim Gorkiy Embankment. An elegant, impressive, 
witty man who smelled of cologne bought with currency and 
expensive imported cognac. 
  The appearance of a living atomic physicist evoked 
involuntary admiration: 
  ``What a fine `secret physicist'! And the years have not had 
an effect on him! A hero of any time!'' 
``He is not at all secret,'' the woman manager on duty replied 
in a deferential whisper. ``And he is not at all a physicist, 
but a cooperative member, a businessman.'' 
  The picture is a familiar one. Today well-to-do people get 
everything! They get the best rooms with a telephone and a 
television. They get the keys to the shower room first of all. 
While the real "secret" people in their semisecret departmental 
hotel patiently endure crowding in common rooms without a 
telephone and without a television. 
  And these are our celebrated forgers of the nuclear shield 
of 
Russia! 
  ``What forgers they are!'' a familiar ``official'' from the 
Ministry of Atomic Energy waved his hand. ``How many years they 
have had nothing to do! It would be a good thing if they have 
not yet forgotten how to 'forge'! The wage of a scientific 
associate in Arzamas-16 on the average is half as much as that 
of a worker of the local sobering-up station. They are scarcely 
releasing money for direct work, they have cut travel 
allowances, having forced people to change from airplane to 
train, and have cut off financing for social needs.'' 
  They have put nuclear physicists on the same footing as 
medical personnel and teachers, physicians and librarians, 
engineers and agronomists. And they seem to have done so quite 
justly. It is now hard for everyone, hence, it is also necessary 
to share the burdens of life impartially--equally. Everyone is 
the same kind of people. 
  Yes, the same. But who will relieve them of responsibility 
for weapons that are capable in a matter of moments of wiping 
millions of human lives from the face of earth? And life on 
earth itself in addition. 
  Incidentally, in the past, in spite of ``the tireless 
concern 
of the party and government,'' secret nuclear weapons developers 
did not show off very much. They lived normally. A little bit 
better, perhaps, than the average level, but not more than that. 
  In one of the laboratories of what is called ``site 20'' of 
the closed city Chelyabinsk-70 there stands an enormous 
instrument the height of a multistory building. It has a 
romantic name--Igur. At times they take visitors here. Even 
foreigners. Last year then U.S. Secretary of State James Baker 
also visited here. 
  I do not know what kind of impression the multistory Igur 
made on the high-ranking American, but the hopeless obsolescence 
of the console, at which research physicists sit, is immediately 
obvious to many of our visitors. The measuring instruments, 
buttons, tumbler switches, microphones, tables, chairs, door 
handles, plates with inscriptions--in short, the entire design 
as if came from the times of the same Kulikovs and since then 
has never been updated. 
  The console of the Japanese boiler house looks like a 21th 
century spaceship. But then in its furnaces they burn nothing 
but ordinary household garbage. 
  For decades, while trying first to catch up with, and then 
to 
outdistance the overseas competitor, we invested the lion's 
share of the assets being released for nuclear affairs in 
``warheads'' themselves. While we invested in instruments and in 
other ``design'' and in human services only what was left of the 
main amount. 
  A few examples. The do-it-yourself building at the same 
``site 20,'' which in common parlance is called a ``lean-to,'' 
is stuffed to capacity with expensive laser equipment. Here they 
are trying to solve the problem of the century--to learn to 
control thermonuclear fusion. Fine! More than that, splendid! 
  But it is stuffy and crowded in the ``lean-to.'' There is no 
room for the relaxation of personnel, there are no cloak room 
and lavatory. 
  The physicists go to eat in a magnificent dining room, the 
two-story building of which has been moved several hundred 
meters beyond the territory of the ``zone.'' Secrecy! It is 
categorically prohibited to allow the cooks and food servers 
beyond the barbed wire of ``site 20''! And one can understand 
this. But.... 
  Was it really hard to bring the building of the dining room 
close to the integrated receiving center or if only to extend to 
it a covered gallery so that the people going to dinner would 
not have to jump over puddles or fall into snowdrifts? 
  We go farther. On the industrial site adjacent to ``site 
20'' 
there is a unit for the production of optical fiber. This is the 
pride of the institute, its present pride, that is why they also 
take visitors here. 
  Once a group of television people from the capital had 
occasion to film the optical fiber equipment in operation. 
  ``But would it be possible,'' the director asked, ``for the 
engineer-physicists all to wear white laboratory coats?'' 
  ``Of course!'' followed the response. ``No problem!'' 
  In a minute the operator filmed a man in a white laboratory 
coat. After a while he filmed a second and third man. The 
trained eye immediately took note that the same 
number--2906--was embroidered on all the laboratory coats. At 
any rate I was interested: 
  ``Is this by any chance not the secret designation of 
something?'' 
  ``Oh, come on!'' the engineer-physicists scoffed. ``This is 
the personal account of Ulyanov. A clock number, in short. And 
the laboratory coat is also his--Ilich's.'' 
  It turned out that for the entire laboratory there was just 
a 
single white laboratory coat. Of scientific associate Anatoliy 
Ilich Ulyanov. 
  Once an article of theoretical physicist V. Bekhterev 
appeared in the factory newspaper of the closed city 
Chelyabinsk-70--NASHA GAZETA. In it alarm was expressed with 
regard to the fact that the executives of the nuclear institute 
on the institute production base had formed several limited 
liability companies. The administrators had begun, as they say, 
to make money. 
  It is possible to understand them in purely human terms: The 
leadership was sick of receiving--moreover, with constant 
delays--a symbolic wage, it decided to set its financial 
situation straight. 
  But just why, the author of the article wondered, did 
officials of the basic structural subdivisions of the institute 
and leading specialists of the operations on nuclear weapons 
decide suddenly to take up private entrepreneurial activity, 
which hardly differs from their official duties? And why in the 
charter of the company is it not stipulated that all the 
operations, which are connected with this activity, should be 
performed during nonworking time? 
  In addition to this there is an irrepressible wanderlust. In 
the same NASHA GAZETA, in particular, it was stated: ``In the 
last three years he (V. Nechay, director of the nuclear 
institute--E.F.) directed the institute from abroad in all for 
about a year.'' 
  Further V. Bekhterev concluded: ``We have not less than 10 
specialists who are capable of performing work in the United 
States no less successfully than the director. Is it not easier 
to grant the present director a good wage and to oblige him to 
deal only with the affairs of the institute?! Or even more 
simply to hire another director and to appoint the present one 
as his deputy for foreign relations?!'' 
  It goes without saying that such insolence, which came in 
addition from the mouth of a rank and file member of the 
collective--I say, some senior scientific associate with 30 
years of service!--could not go without consequences. And a hail 
of the most diverse retributions fell on the head of the too 
emboldened physicist. About 10 years ago they probably would 
have simply wiped him from the face of earth. But, fortunately, 
the times have changed, and V. Bekhterev not only survived, but 
also proposed his candidacy for the post of mayor of 
Chelyabinsk-70. And in the spring of this year he won! 
  However, the opposing side also satisfied, as they say, its 
own interests: Foreign trips are continuing. Now they are going 
with their wives. 
  Outside Russia they have even begun to take into account 
this 
``weakness'' of our executives. Thus, for example, when China 
invited us to exchange delegations of nuclear physicists, they 
sent responsible workers of Chelyabinsk-70 invitations to visit 
the PRC together with their helpmates. Eight Chinese physicists 
came to our country with a return visit. For them this trip was 
an ordinary scientific mission. For us it was a tourist voyage 
of ``nuclear generals'' with their spouses. 
  In recent decades, as specialists claim, we have made such a 
number of nuclear weapons that if today, now we began their 
complete disassembly and destruction and worked in so doing 
around the clock at full tilt, all the same by 2000 it would not 
be possible to eliminate the entire arsenal. And a bit of work 
would remain for the 21st century! 
  As in every sector, in this one, which up to now has been 
silent and has been made most shiny, its own organ of 
self-protection has appeared. It is called the SRYaZ--the union 
of developers of nuclear warheads. For a year and a half the 
members of the SRYaZ have been sending letters to the highest 
instances, trying to familiarize the authorities with the 
critical situation in their sector. But all the attempts of the 
``secret physicists'' to knock at the doors of the offices of 
the ``first people'' until heard, alas, have been unsuccessful. 
  Meanwhile they want to say very little. Every nuclear 
warhead, the members of the SRYaZ recall, has a specific term of 
reliability, upon the expiration of which the warhead is liable 
to disassembly and partial destruction. It is necessary to turn 
over the fissionable materials for special storage. 
  This entire process should take place under the strictest 
monitoring of specialists. The ones who conceived and developed 
this nuclear warhead. The ones who know it thoroughly. No other 
nuclear specialist--be it an American, a Frenchman or an 
Englishman--will be able to guarantee the safety of the 
disassembly of our bombs or projectiles. For the simple reason 
that our nuclear secrets, which have been incorporated in one 
warhead or another, are known only to its developers. 
  Only one formula is acceptable here: As long as if only 
one nuclear warhead exists, specialists, who know it in detail 
and are capable owing to this of guaranteeing us complete 
safety, should serve. 
  It is, it would seem, so simple, so logical. But no, the 
collapse of the Russian nuclear sector is continuing. 
  On 4 August of this year a telegram from Chelyabenergo, in 
which in categorical form they were ordered by the 10th of the 
month to pay off the debt on the charge for used electricity, 
arrived at the nuclear center in Chelyabinsk-70. Otherwise, it 
was stated in the telegram, the closed city would be 
disconnected from the electric power network! 
  A most unique document of our market era! A most honorable 
place in the future museum of nuclear physics should by right 
belong to it. Next to photographs of the authors of the 
telegram. Do they realize what can happen a second after the 
closed city ceases to receive electric power? 
  The noose on the neck of closed nuclear cities is being 
drawn 
tighter and tighter. A little more and complete financial 
collapse will set in, after which the ``secret physicists,'' who 
have been thrown to the mercy of fate, will finally scatter in 
different directions. And then it will remain for us just to 
wait until it expires--this term of reliability of nuclear 
warheads. But even physicists are not joking with this.

  [Abstract] Quantitative data on the rates of 
oxidation-reduction reactions of U, Np, and Pu in organic 
solutions of tributyl phosphate (TBF) are needed for mathematic 
modeling of redox processes in the extraction technology of 
spent nuclear fuel, as well as having independent scientific 
interest. Tetravalent uranium as a reducing agent for Pu and Np 
ions is used widely and has many advantages, one being the 
possibility of conducting the reaction in both aqueous and 
organic phases, but at the same time the capability of U(VI) of 
being extracted with TBF is a main cause of the non-productive 
consumption of U(IV) owing to its oxidation with nitric acid in 
the TBF phase. Various attempts have been made to study the 
kinetics of U(IV) oxidation with nitric acid in TBF, and it has 
been established that this reaction is autocatalytic. After an 
induction period the reaction becomes first order and its rate 
is little affected by the concentration of nitric acid in TBF. 
In the present work a differential equation was developed for 
this reaction. Activation energy for the first stage was 
determined to be 65.3 kJ/mole. The reaction mechanism includes 
parallel flowing slow stages of interaction of UOH[.sup]+3[/] 
ions with HNO[.sub]2[/] molecules and U[.sup]+4[/] ions 
with nitronium perchlorate. Figures 3; references 9: 6 Russian, 
3 Western.

  [Abstract] A correlation has been detected between the 
reactivity of organic hydrazine derivatives and the inductive 
properties of the radical-substituent as in the reaction with 
NpO[.sup]+2[/][.sub]2[/] ions. It has been demonstrated that a 
lengthening the hydrocarbon chain, particularly from methyl to 
ethylhydrazine, results in a lowering in the reduction rate of 
Np(VI). It may thus be expected that further substitution of the 
ethyl group with propyl would lead to further reduction in the 
reactivity of hydrazine. In the present work the reaction rate 
constant for the reduction of Np(VI) to Np(V) with 
isopropoyhydrazine was determined to be 19 
liter[.sup]0.1[/]/mole[.sup]0.1[/] at 25.2Î C and 
ionic strength Ê = 2. Activation energy and entropy are E = 
69.4 kJ/mole, ¯S[.sup]*[/] = 30 J/moleK. The reaction 
mechanism fits a general oxidation mechanism for hydrazine 
derivatives with single electron oxidizers. Figures 2; 
references 5: 4 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] In previous study [cf. 937M0174G] of the 
reaction kinetics of Np(VI) with isopropylhydrazine it was 
demonstrated the reactivity of the latter lies somewhere between 
that of hydrazine and ethylhydrazine, depending on the 
corresponding dampening of the positive inductive effect in the 
series methyl- ethyl-propyl. The present work is a further study 
of the relationship between reactivity and induction effect of 
the radical substituent in the hydrazine molecule, using ter- 
butylhydrazine. The reaction rate constant is 518 
mole[.sup]0.1[/]/liter[.sup]0.1[/]min. at 25Î C and 
ionic strength Ê = 2. Activation energy and entropy are E = 
61 
kJ/mole and ¯S[.sup]*[/] = 60 J/moleK. A correlation was 
found to exist between the Np(VI)-hydrazine reaction rate 
constant and the Taft induction constant. Figure 1; references

  [Abstract] The reactivity of organic hydrazine derivatives 
is determined by two factors, viz. the induction effect of the 
substituent radical and the basicity of the substituted 
hydrazine. The basicity constant of phenylhydrazine is 5.4 X 
10[.sup]-6[/], i.e. three orders higher than the basicity 
constant for hydrazine. This should lead to an acceleration in 
the reduction of Np(VI). Also, the phenyl group has a negative 
induction effect and its introduction to the hydrazine molecule 
results in a decrease in electron density at the nitrogen atom 
and a deceleration in the reduction reaction. In the present 
work the rate constant for reduction of Np(VI) with 
phenylhydrazine in nitric acid was determined to be 1620 
liter[.sup]0.6[/]/mole[.sup]0.6[/]min. Activation energy 
and entropy are 31.4 kJ/mole and 83 J/mole, respectively. The 
change in reaction rate of Np(VI) reduction when changing from 
an alkyl substituted hydrazine derivative to that of 
phenylhydrazine may be explained as a confluence of two factors 
- the induction effect of the radical-substituent and the 
basicity of the substituted hydrazine. Figures 2; references 17: 
11 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] The purpose of the present work is to provide a 
simple mathematical description of all known data on the 
distribution of uranium and plutonium in the PUREX process 
suitable for optimizing the treatment of spent nuclear fuel 
(including uranium-plutonium, i.e. systems with high 
concentrations of plutonium). Virtually all experimental data on 
the distribution of U(VI) and Pu(IV) aqueous nitrate solutions 
and 30 percent TBF (tributyl phosphate) in n-paraffins were 
processed. The data are presented as regressive relationships of 
distribution coefficients to component concentration. Accuracy 
is 8 percent. References 11: 5 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] The distribution of uranyl and plutonium 
nitrates and nitric acid in the PUREX process has been well 
studied and the results for systems employing 30 percent TBF 
(tributyl phosphate) solutions in paraffins have been presented. 
However, a gap remains in the published experimental data: 
missing are data on the distribution of uranium and plutonium in 
this system at higher temperatures. Interest in these data 
intensified following publication of a method for the joint 
extraction of uranium and plutonium at a higher temperature 
(55Î C), combining the uranium and plutonium into the 
raffinate to 2 grams/liter and 20 mg/liter, respectively. This 
approach to the extraction of these metals may be used in the 
regeneration of spent nuclear fuel. In the present work a study 
was made of extraction equilibria in aqueous solutions of 
(UO[.sub]2[/])(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/]- 
Pu(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]4[/]-HNO[.sub]3[/] in 20 and 30 
percent TBF in n-dodecane at 25 and 60Î C. The data were 
obtained in the stable region of a two phase system. The regions 
in the vicinity of the critical point were also studied 
(formation of a second organic phase at high plutonium nitrate 
concentration), as well as the behavior of protactinium in the 
system. References 6: 2 Russian, 4 Western.

  [Abstract] The use of n-paraffin hydrocarbons as diluents 
for alkylphosphate extractants in operations involving solutions 
of spent nuclear fuel is encumbered by the separation into two 
layers of the metal-containing extracts upon reaching a certain 
(critical) concentration of metal (thorium, plutonium, 
strontium, etc.). These layers are not water-soluble and make 
the extraction process more difficult (possible disruption of 
the hydrodynamics of the process and raising the danger of a 
nuclear accident resulting from poor prognosis in the 
accumulation of highly concentrated fissionable material in the 
apparatus). Various methods are known for increasing the volume 
of the extractant such as raising the temperature, introducing 
aromatic compounds and alcohols, and using an isoparaffin as an 
extractant diluent. Known advantages of the latter include low 
freezing point, and low viscosity of products in aqueous 
solutions, as compared to normal paraffins. In the present work 
a study was made of dynamic viscosity and density of isoparaffin 
diluents of tributyl phosphate as functions of temperature. It 
was demonstrated that it is possible to raise the volume of the 
extractant in respect to plutonium. Empirical relationships are 
presented for computing maximum extractant volume (tributyl 
phosphate in isoparaffin solvents) as functions of mobility.

  [Abstract] The operation of fast neutron reactors and the 
associated accumulation of spent fuel presents several problems 
in the reprocessing of the fuel. Some of the main problems are 
the high activity of the working solutions, and the possibility 
of the formation of a second organic phase during extraction 
reprocessing due to the high concentrations of plutonium against 
a background of significant quantities of uranyl nitrate. A 
previously presented process is unique in that it combines 
uranium-plutonium extraction at a high temperature (55Î C) 
and up to 2 grams/liter and 20 mg/liter, respectively, of 
uranium and plutonium throw off. Full saturation of the 
extractant and a high temperature provide high efficiency in 
separation from splintered elements. However, the process was 
presented as a general plan only and a technological layout and 
working conditions are lacking. In the present work results are 
presented on the mathematical modeling of a single cycle scheme 
for extraction refining of spent nuclear fuel from fast neutron 
reactors with simultaneous extraction of uranium and plutonium 
at high temperature. An optimum configuration with stable 
operating conditions was found. The possibility of automating 
the process was demonstrated. Figure 1; references 5: 2 Russian,

  [Abstract] The problem of deactivating liquid radioactive 
wastes formed during operation of nuclear reactors and refining 
spent fuel has become acute. Most of this waste is contained in 
effluents having medium to low levels of contamination. This 
problem became especially significant following the accident at 
Chernobyl and in connection with rehabilitation efforts at the 
``MAYAK'' Production Association in Chelyabinskaya Oblast. Both 
sorption and ion exchange methods are used to treat natural and 
waste waters and much work has been published in this area. 
However, the results obtained by various authors are difficult 
to compare analytically because they were obtained under a 
variety of experimental conditions, and estimating the 
sorption-selective properties becomes qualitative or only 
semi-quantitative in character. Over the past several years the 
Physical Chemistry Institute has been conducting a systematic 
study on the sorption- selectivity properties of organic ion 
exchange resins in respect to cesium and strontium nucleides 
within the framework of a government program to liquidate the 
remains of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. In the present work 
the sorption-selectivity characteristics of natural and modified 
aluminum silicates, synthetic zeolites, phosphates, transition 
metal ferrocyanides, and carbonaceous materials were determined 
in respect to cesium and strontium ions. Coefficients of 
distribution for micro- quantities of strontium-85 and 
cesium-137 in sodium and calcium nitrate solutions under static 
conditions were determined. Treatment of Moscow River tap water 
contaminated with cesium and strontium was studied under dynamic 
conditions. It was demonstrated that the most effective sorbents 
against cesium are the ferrocyanide sorbents and natural 
aluminum silicates, while synthetic zeolites type A are most 
effective against strontium. References 17: 16 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] A [.sup]188[/]W-[.sup]188[/]Re generator 
is based on the separation of rhenium-188 radionucleides from 
wolfram-188 formed by irradiation of wolfram-186. Basic problems 
in obtaining this generator are the accumulation of a parent 
wolfram-188 radionucleide having sufficient specific activity, 
dissolution of a wolfram target and conversion to an insoluble 
matrix by selection of a sorbent and sorbent form of wolfram, 
determining the sorption conditions, charging the generator 
column with radioactive wolfram, and elution of rhenium-188 with 
maximum bulk activity and high radionucleidic and chemical 
purity of the end radionucleide. In the present work a study was 
made of radiochemical fundamentals of this generator. 
Possibilities for accumulation of a parent radionucleide of 
wolfram-188 of high specific activity were determined. Optimum 
conditions were found for dissolution of wolfram targets from 
various materials (oxide, metal, acids) and converting them into 
a sorpable form. Rules governing the sorption of wolfram and 
rhenium on several sorbents were studied and the conditions for 
maximum and minimum sorption of both metals were determined. The 
conditions for charging generator columns with radioactive 
wolfram and the elution of highly active rhenium-188 were worked 
out. Aluminum oxide was used as sorbent and a sodium chloride 
salt solution was used as an eluent. Several series of 
generators with activities to 4 GBk were prepared and studied.

  [Abstract] A basic way to increase the reliability of 
isolating radioactive wastes from the biosphere is through 
immobilization in chemically, thermally, and radiationally 
stable in materials having long time periods of stability. This 
requirement is met most nearly in synthetic mineral-like 
materials--analogs of natural rocks, which are known to remain 
stable over geological periods of time. In the 1970's a titanate 
ceramic called SYNROC (synthetic rock) was developed in 
Australia from perovskite, zirconolite, and chollandite minerals 
by hot pressing at 10[.sup]2[/]-10[.sup]3[/] MPa pressures 
and 1200-1400Î C temperatures. However, this method presents 
great technological difficulties from the standpoint of 
equipment design. A more convenient method to synthesize SYNROC 
is from the melt and the first modification, SYNROC-A was thus 
prepared. In the present work other modifications, SYNROC-A, -B, 
-C, and -D were prepared in crucibles in a silicon carbide 
furnace and by induction melting in a cold crucible. The 
synthesized samples contained 10 and 15 percent by weight of 
oxides of liquid and solid radioactive wastes. Properties of the 
molten materials not containing the wastes are analogous to 
materials prepared by hot pressing. Introduction of an oxide of 
a medium-level radioactive waste material to SYNROC-B lowers its 
chemical stability. The effectiveness of preparing SYNROC type 
ceramics by induction melting in a cold crucible was 
demonstrated. Figures 3; references 18: 7 Russian, 11 Western.

  [Abstract] From an economic standpoint, it is desirable to 
use low cost and readily available materials such as rock, 
industrial wastes, or fuel slag as matrices for localizing and 
immobilizing radioactive wastes. Glassification of 
sodium-containing radioactive wastes requires non-alkaline or 
low alkali rock and slags or other materials. Specifically, 
basalt, datolite, quartz sand, fluorite, clays, and loams have 
been proposed. The advantages of loam are mainly that it is 
readily available throughout the Russian platform, contains all 
required glass-forming components, especially silica and 
alumina, low concentrations of alkaline oxides, and a large 
amount of clay particles of less than 1 micron particle size, 
which facilitates making a uniform paste or slurry having 
thixotropic properties and being capable of long term storage in 
closed containers as well as transportation by pipeline under 
pressure over long distances. In the present work a study was 
made of glass formation in systems Na[.sub]2[/]O (waste 
oxides)- 
Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]- 
SiO[.sub]2[/], encompassing glass compositions obtained from 
radioactive wastes and loam. Relationships between viscosity, 
specific electrical resistance, and chemical stability as 
functions of glass composition in a radioactive waste oxide-loam 
pseudo-binary system were determined. Infrared spectroscopy and 
electron paramagnetic resonance indicated that at over 40 
percent radioactive waste oxide content in the glasses, deep 
structural changes take place which are related to 
depolymerization of silicon-oxygen carcass manifested 
particularly as a marked increase in the leaching out rate 
sodium ions and cesium radionucleides. Figures 5; references 19:

  [Abstract] The use of glass composition materials for 
immobilization of radioactive wastes has many advantages over 
uniform glass matrices. Glass composition materials consist of a 
glass matrix of a given composition in which the radioactive 
components are distributed as a dispersed phase. They are 
universal in waste composition and therefore using them makes it 
possible expand the class of treated wastes. Specifically, it is 
possible to immobilize in a glass matrix radioactive wastes 
containing insoluble compounds such as sulfates, molybdates, and 
oxides of heavy metals. Also, the technological process of 
radioactive waste immobilization presupposes a shorter high 
temperature action on the waste material than that of 
traditional methods of glassification. In the present work a 
comparative analysis was made between the two glasses. A maximum 
limiting value was determined for the particle size of the 
included radioactive phase in the glass composition and this 
value was found to be a function of the properties of the glass 
matrix and the coefficient of distribution of the radionucleide 
phase in the matrix. Figures 2; references 8: 6 Russian, 2

Prevent the Spread of AIDS in the Russian Federation (AIDS 
Control)''] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Goals and Tasks </H5>
  The main goal of this program is to prevent the spread of 
AIDS in the Russian Federation, lower socioeconomic consequences 
of AIDS by means of coordinated implementation of an aggregate 
of organizational, scientific and practical measures. 
  These measures will be implemented in the following 
directions: --prevention of sexual and blood transmission of 
AIDS; --diagnosis, treatment and screening; --legal and social 
safeguards; --refinement of epidemiological oversight system; 
--research on the AIDS problem; --furnishing information and 
personnel personnel. 
<H5>  Prevention of Sexual Transmission of AIDS </H5>
  For the next few years, sexual contact will remain as the 
principal route for the spread of AIDS. For this reason, it is 
imperative to establish a system of purposeful information of 
the public about the AIDS problem and increasing danger of 
acquiring this infection, and providing to the public available 
means of preventing sexual transmission of this infection. 
  The information must be understandable for different age and 
social groups. There are plans for: organization of topical 
radio and television transmissions, 25 video clips, 5 cinevideo 
and 5 video films, with organization of their screening in movie 
houses, translation and demonstration via State, agency and 
commercial radio and television channels; preparation and 
large-volume publication, as well as dissemination of 
educational materials (15 million flyers, 1 million posters and 
5 million booklets per year), preparation of 5 general 
educational programs for sex and moral education for different 
age groups, their introduction in preschool institutions, 
general, vocational, secondary specialized and higher 
educational institutions; enlisting young people, religious and 
social organizations, leaders and activities in high-risk groups 
to participate in this work; expansion of the network of 
anonymous screening and psychological support offices, and 
organization of such offices in cities with a population of more 
than 200,000; performance of systematic sociological studies of 
the AIDS problem. 
  In order to provide a sufficient number of contraceptives at 
an affordable price, it is planned to expand their manufacture 
at Russian Federation enterprises and to issue them to specific 
population groups among those with high risk of infection (drug 
addicts, individuals living in dormitories, etc.). 
  It is assumed that the intensity of sexual transmission of 
the virus of immune deficiency will be lowered by 25-30 percent 
by 1996, as a result of implemented measures. Accordingly, there 
will be a reduction in cost of treating AIDS patients (in 1989, 
the cost per patient was 40,000 rubles, and in 1992 prices 
500,000 rubles). 
  The principal executors of this section are: --Russian 
Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary 
and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian State Television and 
Radio Broadcasting Company; --Russian Federation Ministry of 
Education; --Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs; 
--Russian Federation Ministry of Culture; --Russian Federation 
Committee for Cinematography; --Russian Federation Ministry of 
the Press and Information; --Russian Federation Ministry of 
Justice; --Russian Federation Committee for the Chemical and 
Petrochemical Industry; --Russian Federation Ministry of 
Economics; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian 
Federation Committee for Tourism. 
<H5>  Prevention of AIDS Transmission through Blood </H5>
  The program provides for outfitting pertinent laboratories 
with equipment and diagnostic test systems, on the basis of the 
need to make 6 million tests per year, in order to upgrade the 
system of supplying safe blood, other biological materials and 
medical immunobiological preparations. In addition, it is 
planned to exclude by 1995 placental and abortion-related blood 
as raw material for the production of medical immunobiological 
preparations and change to use solely of donor blood for this 
purpose. 
  In view of the danger of potential intramural AIDS 
infection, 
there is a set of steps aimed at training medical personnel to 
ensure sanitary and epidemic-control conditions, expand and 
update the manufacture of syringes, needles, catheters and 
blood-transfusion systems that could cause infection of the 
blood via blood. Due consideration was also given to the fact 
that supplying medical-preventive [medical and preventive care] 
institutions with other types of disposable and reusable medical 
instruments, that come in contact with blood is covered by the 
State program of the Russian Federation for development of 
modern medical equipment and increasing production thereof in 
1992-1993, and for the period up to 1995, which was approved by 
Decree No 77 of the government of the Russian Federation, dated 
10 February 1992, ``On urgent steps to develop modern medical 
equipment and increase its production in 1992-1995.'' The 
program also includes matters of furnishing medical-preventive 
institutions with sterilization equipment. 
  Fulfillment of the above volume of work would provide a 
reliable level of safety of donor blood and blood preparations, 
as well as medical procedures carried out at medical-preventive 
institutions by 1996. 
  The principal executors of this section are: --Russian 
Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary 
and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of 
Internal Affairs; --Russian Federation Committee for the 
Chemical and Petrochemical Industry; --Russian Federation 
Ministry of Finance; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics. 
<H5>  Diagnosis, Treatment and Screening </H5>
  AIDS detection in medical-preventive and 
sanitary-epidemiological institutions will be carried out with 
use of screening and corroborative diagnostic preparations, 
equipment for enzyme immunoassay and polymerase chain reaction 
(gene amplification method), at the rate of the need for 4 
million tests per year when clinically indicated and for 
screening high-risk groups. 
  It is planned to provide effective agents for the treatment 
of patients with AIDS and opportunistic infections that are not 
included in the list of vitally necessary drugs adopted by the 
decree of the government of the Russian Federation dated 26 
December 1991 ``On urgent measures to provide the public and 
RSFSR health care institutions with drugs in 1992 and to develop 
the pharmaceutical industry in 1992-1995.'' 
  Treatment of AIDS patients will be administered at the 
Russian Republic Center for AIDS Prevention and Control in the 
city of Moscow, and at the clinical infectious-disease hospital 
in St. Petersburg, where all types of specialized medical care 
are rendered to them, as well as terminal patient care. 
Treatment and screening of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS 
patients will also be carried out by territorial centers for the 
prevention and control of AIDS and medical-preventive 
institutions in the area of their residence. Offices for 
medicopsychological counseling are being organized in centers 
for AIDS prevention for individuals with this pathology, their 
families, as well as those in high-risk groups. Specialized 
centers are being opened for children who are HIV-positive and 
have AIDS. 
  It is also planned to set limits on State capital 
investments 
for construction and reconstruction of infectious-disease 
hospitals, centers for AIDS prevention and control, laboratories 
for AIDS detection and Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for 
Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight] centers. 
  Implementation of these measures will have a social impact 
by 
1996 with respect to this category of individuals, by extending 
the period of their ability to work and prolonging their lives 
by 2-3 years. 
  The principal executors of this section are:--Russian 
Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary 
and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of 
Economics; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance. 
<H5>  Legal and Social Safeguards </H5>
  The program provides for preparation of a draft law of the 
Russian Federation ``On AIDS Prevention,'' which will reflect 
matters of legal protection of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS 
patients, as well as matters of legal and social protection of 
health care workers exposed to the risk of this infection. 
  There are plans for the following: --legislate steps 
precluding discrimination against the sick and infected; 
--payment of State benefits to individuals infected during 
medical procedures; --free testing, treatment and upkeep of 
HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients in health-care 
institutions; --free travel of these individuals to and from 
place of treatment; --priority provision of isolated housing for 
individuals infectedduring medical manipulations, as well as 
families with infected children up to 16 years old; --education 
of children and adolescents undergoing hospital care. 
  There are also provisions for saving jobs for HIV-positive 
individuals and AIDS patients for the duration of their testing 
and treatment, with the exception of health-care workers 
involved in their jobs in carrying out parenteral procedures. 
Job placement is provided for this category of health-care 
personnel. 
  As a result of implementing these measures, the legal 
relationships will be regulated between the State, medical 
institutions, HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients, as 
well as individual juridical entities, which will provide for 
social and legal protection of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS 
patients, as well as health-care workers and other categories of 
the public. 
  The principal executors of this section are: --Russian 
Federation Ministry of Social Protection of the Public --Russian 
Federation Central Committee of the Health-Care Workers Trade 
Union;--Russian Federation Ministry of Labor; --Russian 
Federation Ministry of Justice; --Russian Federation Ministry of 
Health; --State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological 
Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics; --Russian 
Federation Ministry of Finance. 
<H5>  Refinement of Epidemiological Oversight System </H5>
  It is planned to elaborate a better system of 
epidemiological 
oversight for AIDS, including organization of monitoring of 
HIV-positive and high-risk groups for this infection, laboratory 
test findings and dates for such tests, reliable methods of 
short- and long-term forecasts of development of an epidemic 
process. There will be continued supply of computer hardware and 
software to centers for AIDS prevention and centers of the State 
Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight, as well as 
telecommunication equipment, which will permit establishment of 
a unified and integrated, automated information-analyzing system 
on this problem, based on basic computer programs on the federal 
and regional levels. There will be a revision and improvement of 
the system of medical certification of the public, which calls 
for the change from large-volume, epidemiologically and 
economically unwarranted tests to testing samples of different 
population categories and retention of the volume of tests for 
individuals in high-risk and other groups. 
  By 1996, these measures will permit achieving higher 
effectiveness in detecting sources of infection and pinpointing 
sites of the disease, with concurrent reduction by 10-15 million 
tests in volume of screening the public. With one test costing 
50 rubles (in 1992 prices), these steps will save 500 million 
rubles. Epidemiological and mathematical models will be 
developed to provide high-level forecasting of epidemics and 
related economic expenses. 
  The principal executors of this section are: --State 
Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight --Russian 
Academy of Medical Sciences; --Russian Federation Ministry of 
Health; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian 
Federation Ministry of Economics. 
<H5>  Research on the AIDS Problem </H5>
  There is insufficient funding of research on the AIDS 
problem. This program provides for carrying out research on 
isolation and identification of viruses of human immune 
deficiency, investigation of their biological properties, 
mechanisms of interaction with cells in the body and onset of 
immunodepression in HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients, 
refinement and development of new diagnostic methods, optimum 
treatment programs, search for new compounds and products with 
specific activity, investigation of epidemiology of AIDS, 
development of specific prophylactic agents, methods of 
inactivating the virus in donor material and blood preparations, 
methods of protecting health-care personnel, investigation of 
distinctions of the epidemiological process with AIDS in 
different territories, research aimed at further investigation 
of symptomatology of HIV infection. 
  Research will be carried out within the framework of the 
State research program of the Russian Federation, ``National 
priorities in medicine and health care'' (Section 6 ``AIDS''). 
Formulation of topics in this direction is done annually on the 
basis of competition, with expert evaluation of submitted 
projects. 
  The principal executors of this section are: --Russian 
Academy of Medical Sciences; --State Committee for Sanitary and 
Epidemiological Oversight;--Russian Federation Ministry of 
Health; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian 
Federation Ministry of Economics. 
<H5>  Furnishing Information and Personnel Training </H5>
  The social importance of the the AIDS problem makes it 
necessary to have highly trained personnel to implement 
organizational, therapeutic, prophylactic and epidemic-control 
measures and to furnish them with information. 
  In this regard, there are plans to do the following: --add 
matters of AIDS prevention to the syllabus of secondary general 
educational, vocational, secondary specialized and higher 
educational institutions; --train physicians and pedagogues at 
institutes for advanced training and courses for advancement, 
and specialists in sociopsychological counseling of HIV-positive 
individuals and AIDS patients at the Republic Institute for 
Advanced Training of Educators and its affiliates; --train 
leaders for youth organizations and activists in high-risk 
groups at territorial centers for AIDS prevention; --train 
researchers and clinical health-care specialists in the leading 
specialized research institutions of the Russian Federation (50 
people per year) and abroad (5 per year). 
  It is also planned to publish relevant scientific and 
educational literature (monographs, topical surveys, 
collections, textbooks, guides, etc.) and to subscribe to the 
principal international scientific periodicals dealing with AIDS. 
  These measures will make it possible to train highly 
qualified personnel to administer specialized medical care and, 
at the same time, improve efficiency of the entire system of 
health care, education and information on this problem. 
  The principal executors of this section are: --State 
Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian 
Federation Ministry of Health; --Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences; --Russian Federation Ministry of the Press and 
Information --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics; 
--Russian Federation Ministry of Finance. 
<H5>  Management and Mechanism of Implementation of the Program </H5>
  The effectiveness of implementation of this program will 
depend largely on constant and integral evaluation of its 
progress and subsequent correction (if necessary). 
  For this purpose, there are the following provisions, to: 
--appoint program administrators and organize coordinating 
councils on the federal and regional levels; --carry out 
independent integral evaluation of research and measures, with 
appropriate correction of the program. 
  The program will be implemented through the existing network 
of AIDS-prevention institutions and the State Committee for 
Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight, on the basis of work 
plans of executor organizations. There are also plans to develop 
and implement regional programs with approval of their funding 
in pertinent State agencies of republics of the Russian 
Federation, autonomous oblasts, autonomous okrugs, krays, 
oblasts, cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. 
  It is planned to implement international collaboration with 
the World Health Organization, within the framework of the 
global program for AIDS control, and other international 
organizations. 
  Funding of this program from the federal budget is provided 
in an amount of 12.42 billion rubles and $20.85 million, 
including 6.52 billion rubles and $8.25 million in 1993. Of 
these amounts, limits of State centralized capital investments 
funded by the federal budget and investment credit will 
constitute 4.1 billion rubles for 1993. 
  According to estimates, 96.8 billion rubles, including 32.24 
billion for 1993, will be needed to implement measures to 
provide medical-preventive institutions of the Russian 
Federation with medical instruments (reusable syringes and 
needles, disposable catheters), sterilizers and laboratory 
equipment, protective gear for medical personnel, social and 
legal protection of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients. 
  The functions of State contractors are delegated to the 
State 
Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight and Russian 
Federation Ministry of Health.
